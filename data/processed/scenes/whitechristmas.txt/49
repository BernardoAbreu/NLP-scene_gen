<T>__{slow dissolve to:}
<A>__{long shot railroad station day train about to leave. the general is in the foreground sitting in the buggy. betty is saying goodbye to him. bob and the porter are taking care of her luggage.}
<C>__{general}
<P>__{(shouting over noise of train)}
<D>__{where are you going to be?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{the carousel.}
<A>__{the general looks at her, questioningly.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(whispering, during a lull in the noise)}
<D>__{i sent them a telegram this morning.}
<A>__{the general smiles; betty waves a farewell to him and crosses to the train, starting up the steps. the notion behind this scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue due to the whistle, bells, and escaping steam. the manner of playing, though, indicates the sentiment. to emphasize it: bob is fonder of betty than he realizes, and betty fully realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not return, consciously, her affection. we hear betty:}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{take care of my little sister.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{she can take care of herself. worry about the menfolk. now don't forget to write.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i will send you picture postcards.}
<A>__{not all of this is heard, since the sound effects pick their spots, but the attention is on the general, who is watching the scene with a whimsical look. he, as does the audience, realizes bob's true feelings. as the train starts to leave, betty and bob shake hands. she holds his handshake a little longer than necessary, and bob is forced to move along with the train. finally she releases him, and bob looks after the train, puzzled.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{the camera is now on the train platform, bob out of sight. betty wipes away a tear. in the background we see the general in the buggy noticing this. med. long shot train in distance bob is in the foreground, the general in the background. bob joins the general at the buggy. from waverly's expression we can see that he has decided on a plan of action.}
<C>__{waverly}
<D>__{must be interesting to be a woman.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{the idea's never occurred to me, sir.}
<C>__{waverly}
<D>__{well, think about it.}
<P>__{(bob is thinking about it)}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{not interested!}
<C>__{waverly}
<D>__{a man like you must be an expert on women.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{it's a little immodest to say so, but i consider myself an authority on the fair sex, i've made a study of the subject. they're simple creatures.}
<C>__{waverly}
<D>__{they couldn't fool you?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i'm single.}
<C>__{waverly}
<D>__{'pride goeth before a fall.'}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{'who knows his own strength is twice armed.'}
<C>__{waverly}
<D>__{it's always a pleasure to meet an expert in any field. tell me, why do you think betty went to new york?}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(not willing to admit it)}
<D>__{she has a job in the carousel.}
<C>__{waverly}
<D>__{expert, you're wrong! she went to new york because she's so in love with someone here she just couldn't stand it.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{phil.}
<P>__{(a mixture of}
<D>__{resentment and}
<P>__{frustration)}
<D>__{i'm darned if i can figure out why.}
<C>__{waverly}
<D>__{i thought you were an expert on women.}
<P>__{(to the horse)}
<D>__{come on, delilah!}
