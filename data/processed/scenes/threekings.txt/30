<A>__{doc gets out of the stopped humvee, shaken, and walks around.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i'm all right, i'm cool.}
<A>__{he lies down and breathes heavily with a hand on his chest.}
<D>__{archie gets out and walks around, agitated, clearly upset.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{what is the art of war, because it is not for killing people, it's a stratagem to give life to many by killing the evil perpetrated by a few i am burning up in this goddamn suit }
<A>__{he angrily takes off his gas suit; boxers and sweat drenched green t shirt underneath. troy and vig guzzle water.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{discriminating use of violence as a last resort, and even then, carefully, surgically, that's what i learned, that's what i'm good at. but now they underestimate all this, bomb the same towns for six weeks and still leave the scumbag dictator to starve and butcher his own people.}
<A>__{the others, all drenched in sweat, take off their gas suits.}
<C>__{troy}
<P>__{(agitated)}
<D>__{i don't even know what happened back there. civilians were spitting on their own soldiers; the soldiers were shooting the civilians and ignoring us }
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{they already surrendered to us. now they're after shiites.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{what exactly is a shiite?}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{they make up the ethnic majority but they don't have any power. when bush pulled us out, he told them to start a civil war to bring saddam down, and now they're getting wasted.}
<C>__{vig}
<P>__{(totally puzzled)}
<D>__{the civil war? how could it be the civil war?}
<A>__{fantasy stock footage: union soldiers fight dixie rebels}
<B>__{back to the scene}
<A>__{vig looks puzzled.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{it's a war inside the same country, conrad. that's a civil war.}
<A>__{archie chucks each of them marine uniforms without name tags which everyone puts on, except troy.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{put these on, we are now u.s. marines.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{i can't do this, ok? because i've got a family and if i shit in a bag the rest of my life cuz i got shot after the war's already over that would be pretty fucking stupid, wouldn't it?}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{what is the most important thing in life?}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{what the fuck are you talking about?}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{did you hear anything i said.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{respect is the most important.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{too dependent on other people.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{money.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{comes and goes, man.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{what is this bullshit?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{what's the most important thing?}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{necessity. that's what dictates what will happen at any given time in life. necessity says we don't spend american lives taking out saddam, which leaves saddam the necessity of taking out the shiites so he can stay in power, which leaves us to take the gold.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{we could've been shot.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{did you notice they didn't touch us? we decimated their entire country. they're scared shitless of us. [looks at his watch] there's time to try another bunker. i say we go.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{let's do it.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{rock and roll.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{ok. and i will be wearing fashionable kevlar. as a necessity.}
<A>__{he pulls a vest out of the humvee.}
