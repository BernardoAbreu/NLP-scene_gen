<L>__{interior club rest room night}
<A>__{stanley pushes into the bathroom. he kicks the wastebasket across the room.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{he pushes a club kid out of the way of the sink. he turns on the water and washes his face. slowly he leans his forehead against the mirror. ginger appears behind him.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{what are you looking at?}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{relax, stanley. you can do this.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{get away from me.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{i want to help you.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{help? help what, squeegee my brain off the ceiling?}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{it was just a test, stan, you passed.}
<A>__{ginger pulls out a cigarette and a lighter from her plastic overcoat.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{a test... i don't know why i let you talk me into this. i can't believe how desperate i am.}
<A>__{she exhales toward stanley.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{i thought you were here saving your daughter, stanley.}
<A>__{he turns around.}
<C>__{stanley}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{look... i'd do anything to get holly back. but, if i end up in a box or back in jail, then i really can't help her, can i? what i should do, is take my money and go back to court.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{back to court? back to melissa's gladiators? you throw a hundred grand at her, she'll throw five back at you. it's not about holly, it's about beating you. you know that. think, stanley.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{what i'm thinking about is that you're willing to put a gun to my head to see if i can hack }
<A>__{suddenly three club kids come busting into the bathroom. ginger interrupts him by slamming stan between the urinals and ramming her tongue into his mouth with the kind of wet, aggressive action that takes a movie from pg 13 to an r. when the kids realize that the urinals are occupied, they leave. slowly ginger takes her tongue out of stan's mouth. they look at each other. she smiles at him.}
<C>__{ginger}
<P>__{(coyly)}
<D>__{sorry...}
<A>__{a beat, for a moment there exists something between them, then bam, she's all business again.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{so, let me sum it up for you, stanley. you live in a trailer.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're a felon, working a dead end job. you want to get holly back, gabriel's your only shot.}
<B>__{angle on stanley}
<A>__{as he realizes she's right, he's got nothing to lose. slam! he smacks the mirror with his fist, then walks out of the rest room. ginger slowly lifts the cigarette. she exhales, then slowly smiles. she's got him.}
