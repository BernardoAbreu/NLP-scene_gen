<C>__{george}
<D>__{thanks for seeing me on such short notice.}
<P>__{(he takes a careful beat)}
<D>__{i... i wanted to talk to you about booking andy on "saturday night live."}
<A>__{lorne michaels squirms uncomfortably. he chooses his words.}
<C>__{lorne michaels}
<D>__{george i don't know if andy works for our show anymore. that wrestling stuff... is such a turnoff.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{we agree completely.}
<P>__{(tactfully begging)}
<D>__{andy has to reconnect with his core audience. so i got him on letterman tonight. he's gonna apologize to jerry lawler, then repent for all his bad guy shenanigans.}
<A>__{lorne michaels mulls this over.}
<C>__{lorne michaels}
<D>__{that's smart.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{he's very sincere.}
<P>__{(quietly emphatic)}
<D>__{and he needs your show...}
<A>__{beat. lorne michaels nods.}
<C>__{lorne michaels}
<D>__{okay. it'd be good to have the old andy back.}
