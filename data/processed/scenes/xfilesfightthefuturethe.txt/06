<L>__{interior cave present day}
<B>__{their pov of stevie}
<A>__{on the floor below covered with dirt, in his nose and mouth. spitting out. (all these boys have texas in their voices.)}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{i got...i got....i got....}
<P>__{(straining)}
<D>__{....the wind knocked out of me.}
<A>__{this draws no sympathy from above, only laughter.}
<B>__{the boys up above}
<A>__{staring excitedly.}
<D>__{3rd boy looks like a cave or something. 2nd boy what's down there, stevie? anything?}
<B>__{over the boys above}
<A>__{stevie has gotten up, moving out of the patch of sunlight. disappearing from view for a moment. then reappearing, still spitting out dirt. but holding:}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{human skull.}
<A>__{one side partially missing from the cranium. but it brings whoops of delight from the boys above.}
<D>__{3rd boy toss it up here, dude.}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{no way, buttwipe. i found it. it's mine.}
<B>__{angle up on stevie}
<A>__{the other boys looking down at him. stevie looking at the skull. strangely, the light shines through it. it is milky, opaque, as if it's bone that's turned somehow glassy in places. then:}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{anyways, there's bones all over the place down here.}
<A>__{stevie looks down at his feet. camera following his look down to where there are indeed more human bones. and something else. he takes a couple of steps in place, standing in a familiar black, oily substance which is climbing up his tennis shoe from the rock floor, over the edge of the shoe and down into the shoe itself. then the skull drops in the frame, clattering on the hard floor of the cave. camera slowly rising up from stevie's shoes following subcutaneous worms which have begun locomoting aggressively up his legs. as his whole body is wracked by a shivering seizure of some kind. camera rises, following the path of the worms as they move up the legs of his shorts. some appearing on his bare arms, but the great majority continuing up to stevie's neck, toward his face. stevie stands paralyzed. letting out guttural sounds not dissimilar to when the wind was knocked out of him.}
<P>__{3rd boy (o.s.)}
<D>__{hey, stevie....}
<A>__{but stevie cannot answer him. camera continuing up to the boys above. looking down at their friend. their eyes go wide.}
<D>__{2nd boy you okay?}
<A>__{but what they see next answers that question for them.}
<B>__{their pov of stevie}
<A>__{his face suddenly alive with the subcutaneous worms. moving toward his eyes which begin filling with black oil. looking much now like alien eyes.}
<B>__{close on the boys above}
<A>__{freaked by what they see. and doing what any kid would do now.}
<D>__{3rd boy hey, man. let's get outta here.}
<A>__{and they do. bolting from the hole in the top of the cave. camera pushing up through this hole to reveal we are:}
