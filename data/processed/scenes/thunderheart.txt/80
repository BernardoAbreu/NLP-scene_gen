<L>__{exterior buffalo butte motel morning}
<A>__{a raven is sentinel on a telephone wire that crosses the road from the bar to motel. a few trucks remain parked in front of the jointerior ray approaches room 13, looking shell shocked. his boots leave blue mud prints all the way to the door. he unlocks it.}
<L>__{interior buffalo butte motel room}
<A>__{ray has cast off his field clothes and is halfway into one of his cleaner suits. he looks haggard but still buoyant, his eyes piercing. the connecting door creaks open and cooch walks in. the sac is freshly showered and he is fidgeting with a windsor knot. he studies his number two man, says nothing for a moment but is obviously holding something down. his face is a red hue.}
<C>__{cooch}
<P>__{(extra casual)}
<D>__{couldn't sleep, ray?}
<A>__{ray looks at cooch. when he speaks, his voice is dry.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{cooch crosses the room, and picks up ray's jeans which look like they went through a sandlot tackle match in a mud hole. ray tucks his clean shirt in; watching cooch.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i had to finish something with crow horse.}
<A>__{cooch walks up to ray slowly and takes his face in his hand, turning it toward lamp light to study the bruise along his left eye, a residual from a crow horse hook.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{that's where you were. you had to go back and have it out with the indian law...}
<A>__{ray nods, and cooch slowly breaks a smile. an insecure smile but a smile just the same. he starts to laugh.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{you fucking hot head, we can get in trouble for that.}
<A>__{cooch laughs in amusement and ray's face crinkles into a grin as he lowers his eyes, wiping a paper towel over his face. and then, suddenly, ray lunges at cooch. he slams the agent in charge against the hollow wall, and holds him there. his eyes wild.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me what we were doing here?}
<A>__{cooch is stunned.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{we're running a cover up and you didn't }
<A>__{cooch suddenly explodes, throwing ray off of him and sending him reeling back against the sink. he points a finger at his charge.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{you ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking everglades, mister.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you didn't tell me about red deer table }
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{ what the hell is red deer table?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what is it? it's genocide, that's what it is. it's a pay zone for some u.s. corporation and a dead zone for the people here. uranium, cooch.}
<A>__{cooch's eyes go frighteningly cold. he can't believe what he's hearing.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{jesus christ. what are you doing? what the hell were you doing out there?}
<A>__{ray says nothing. he just stands there, against the sink, breathing like a fighter against the turnbuckle.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{this was a selective operations unit, agent levoi. there is classified information pertaining to our national security. you don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit that's insubordination. jesus christ }
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{ if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{we were sworn in on the constitution to protect federal matters, ray. i don't know about uranium, i don't know about red dog table all i know is we did our job. it's over.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{we neutralized anybody with a voice. leo, jimmy... eagle bear. anyone who was standing in the way of the land. is that it?}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{no. we neutralized enemies of the united states. anti american radicals who have killed federal officers out here!}
<A>__{ray turns to the sink, turns the faucet on to get some water on his face. the water only trickles into the basin.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{jesus, ray. you think i don't like the indians? not true. these were noble people but their day is gone. they're a conquered nation. they want all of america back but they can't even keep the garbage out of their own front yards. it's sad, ray. but it's just the way it is. we have to function as a colonial police force out here.}
<A>__{ray leans on the sink, watching the water start to spurt free. he shuts it off. turns to look at cooch. and it is then the door opens some knocking after the door is already opened and sa miles enters.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you gentlemen ready hi, ray.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{yeah, we're ready.}
<A>__{ray doesn't turn from the sink.}
