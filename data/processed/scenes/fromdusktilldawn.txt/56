<D>__{and now for your viewing pleasure. the mistress of the macabre. the epitome of evil. the most sinister woman to dance on the face of the earth. lowly dogs, get on your knees, bow your heads and worship at the feet of santanico pandemonium!}
<A>__{the lights go down low. a light hits the stage. the opening notes of the coaster's "down in mexico" fills the room. the crowd hushes up. and on the stage steps santanico pandemonium. this mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that stendhal described in "as the promise of happiness," but the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom. she dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the stage, but like she owned the world. and if the patrons of the titty twister are her world, the world is proud to be her possession. all activity in the bar, save santanico, stops. even the fuller gecko table falls under her spell. especially richard, scott and kate. seth knows this song and accompanies from the table with the guitar. when the music builds to its explosive section. santanico leaps from the stage, landing in the middle of the room. she does an eyes closed voodoo dance in perfect step with the beat. as the music continues to play, a very fucked up looking chet pussy walks in. he goes over to razor charlie and points at seth's table, describing what happened. as the last verse plays, santanico, like a snake, comes up from the ground, on top of the fuller gecko table. richard, kate and scott are enraptured. santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy richard. she stands over him. while moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg. she lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her toes, and sticks it in richard's face.}

<P>__{(to richard in spanish)}
<D>__{drink up.}
<A>__{richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. the crowd goes wild. santanico smiles, master of all she surveys. jacob and scott are embarrassed. kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power this woman has over a man she's deathly feared. seth laughs out loud a mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping the beat with his guitar. across the room, razor charlie, chet by his side, motions over big emilio. he begins explaining with pointing what seth and company did to chet. richard continues to suck her toes. the song ends, santanico extracts her foot from richard's mouth. steps off the table. takes a drink of whiskey. looks down at the seated richard. she grabs the back of his hair, yanks his head back. his mouth opens because she's hurting him. she leans her face over his like she's going to kiss him. then let's the whiskey from her mouth fall into his. they never touch. the crowd applauds. she lets go of richard's hair. except for jacob and richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds, none louder than seth.}

<A>__{the table laughs.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{which reminds me of a joke. little red riding hood is walking through the forest and she comes across little bo peep, and little bo peep says: "little red riding hood, are you crazy? don't you know the big bad wolf is walking these woods and if he finds you he's gonna pull down your dress and squeeze your titties?" then little red riding hood hitches up her skirt and taps a .357 magnum she has holstered on her thigh and says: "no he won't."}

<A>__{slow motion: blood drips down the side of seth's face. slow motion: it splatters to the floor. the camera scans the crowd. the patrons are scared, but the waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips. slow motion: blood drips from richard's shoulder. it falls to the floor, splattering. we move into santanico's face. a special aroma fills her nostrils. her eyes lock on richard. the look on her face could easily be read as intense sexual desire. close up kate on floor looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, santanico's transformation. her nose recedes into her face like a rodent's. the whites of her eyes turn yellow. the fangs of a beast protrude from her mouth. kate yells from the floor.}

<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{richie, look out!}
<A>__{before richie can turn around. santanico leaps across the floor, lands on his back and sinks her fangs into richie's wounded shoulder. richard lets loose with an agonizing scream. seth turns to his brother's cry. he sees santanico pandemonium, like a mongoose attached to a cobra, legs wrapped around richard's waist, fangs buried deep in his shoulder, and richard screaming and slamming about, trying to knock her off. richard screams to seth:}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{shoot her! shoot her! get her off!}
<A>__{seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. he can't get a clear shot. jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing. richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. santanico rides him down to the floor. seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and fires, hitting the vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother. richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about half way before he stops, saying:}

<A>__{suddenly, the eyes of big emilio, razor charlie and chet pussy pop open. the "dead" men sit up with evil grins on their faces. the patrons scream. a whore locks the front door (which is a complicated lock with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar and yells:}
<C>__{whore}
<D>__{dinner is served!}
<A>__{the bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have turned into yellow eyed, razor fanged, drool dripping}

<C>__{santanico}
<D>__{let's see if you taste as good as your brother.}
<A>__{she approaches seth, who fires at her. bam... bam... bam... click... click... click... click. she laughs and gives her hair a toss back. seth, moving backwards, is terrified. santanico gives seth a swinging round house punch to the jaw, that sends him flying over a table, sliding across the floor and into the wall. a bad ass biker named frost, with a hideous burn on the side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps. big emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the bar to the other. the biker winner of the bare knuckle fight, sex machine, goes head to head with a stripper. the vamp might have superhuman strength, but sex machine has close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the vamp bitch blow for blow. then he grabs her by the waist, lifts her up over his head and brings her down hard on an upturned table, impaling her on the wooden leg. frost is still swinging his pool cue, when razor charlie appears, straight razor in hand. frost jumps off the table to meet the challenge. razor charlie swings at him, frost leaps back, swinging his pool cue at him. they do this dance, till frost cracks charlie upside the head with the pool cue, breaking it in half. charlie feels the hit. frost plunges the splintered end of the cue in razor charlie's heart. green blood comes out of his chest, as charlie screams the vampire's death scream. seth comes to and finds santanico standing over him. he tries to rise, but santanico places her bare foot on his chest, pinning him down to the floor. he tries to move, but the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block placed on his chest.}

<D>__{end over end.}
<A>__{close up santanico looking down at seth, her face contorts to feed mode, when the bottle hits her square in the head, shattering. we see that jacob behind the bar threw it. santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is momentarily dazed. she looks down at seth. seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires. santanico is hit in the chest. the bullet from the gun makes the liquor soaked robe ignite. santanico screams as she goes up in flames. big emilio sees santanico's fiery death. he lets out a cry.}
<C>__{big emilio}
<D>__{noooooo!}
<A>__{he turns his hateful gaze on the two humans. seth and jacob see big emilio zeroing in on them, then they see him move his big frame in their direction. seth turns to jacob.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{we may be in trouble.}
<A>__{big emilio walks steadily through the bar like godzilla walks through tokyo. tipping over tables, knocking fighting vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp out seth and jacob. a trucker jumps in his path to attack him, with a quick swing of his hand the trucker is brushed aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort. big emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off seth and jacob. seth and jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent. big emilio stands in front of them. the two men hold their wood tight. fangs grow in big emilio's mouth that make him look like a huge walking shark. just when big emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,}

<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{that's enough.}
<A>__{jacob and seth stop. sex machine holds a pool cue in his hand. he snaps off the end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, sticks it into big vamp's fallen body. big emilio, screams, twitches and dies. the pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead vamp. chet pussy spies ms. apple pie pussy herself, kate. he breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from around his mouth. kate and scott are cowering behind the bar when chet appears over the top. they both let out a scream. scott goes to protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his trouble. chet dives at kate.}

<B>__{gulp.}
<A>__{chet has swallowed the crucifix. a sizzling sound is heard moving down from his throat to his belly. he opens his mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. he jumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain. he jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming all the while. kate and scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on their faces. chet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top of his lungs like a vamp king lear.}

<D>__{stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the pain...}
<A>__{he plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being staked, chet lets out a sigh of relief. by this time there are not too many people left. most of the vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the customers have been butchered or drained. all that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers and two whores. on the human side are seth, jacob and his kids, sex machine and frost. aside from the children, who are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding wooden stakes. the four human men group together. the four female vampires charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood. seth, jacob, sex machine and frost raise their weapons and slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. all four staked bodies hit the floor. kate and scott run from behind the bar to their father's side. they all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has taken place. the floor is littered with dead bodies.}

<D>__{ain't they supposed to burn up or something?}
<A>__{at that moment a bright flash erupts, illuminating everyone's face. the sound of quick burning flames fills the air. everybody shields their eyes from the intense light, which lasts only a split second. it vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. all that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies once lay. they all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then run for the door. it's locked. they bang on the door, but it's useless. it ain't budging, yet they all go on banging. except for seth. he never ran for the door. he walks over to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it. he takes his dead hand.}
