<A>__{a mob scene. video crews are herded to one side by bailiffs as sandra and baxter, with kelly in tow, move toward a side door. sam and ken round a corner, followed by ray and gloria who walk on either side of suzie. kelly sees them. she makes a run at suzie. for a moment the girls shove and kick but ray and gloria are between them in a hurry, pulling then apart as baxter arrives to take charge of kelly, pulling her toward the door. ruby and walter arrive now too. suzie runs to them and they lead her through the crowd, walter pushing people aside with his long, tattooed arms. gloria heaves a sigh. ray pushes a hand through his hair, then turns to find sam looking at him. most of the press have run off to follow the girls looking for more action. it is a quiet moment. the two men lock eyes.}
