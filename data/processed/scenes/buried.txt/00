<L>__{interior unknown room night}
<A>__{darkness. silence. after a long beat, we hear movement, confined and contained. we then hear the sound of a man, paul conroy, groaning, making confused attempts at words. we hear his movement; short, abrupt shifting, ending almost immediately with the sound of his body banging against wood. he screams, though it's clear from the sound that his mouth is covered by something. after attempting to sit up, he immediately bangs his head against something. it's terribly warm and his breaths are labored. he attempts to move to his left and right, only to find that he is confined on those sides, as well. he frantically shifts about, only to discover, by touch, that he is encased in something. something is very wrong, and he doesn't need to see to know that. finally, we see him, lit by the flame of the zippo he holds in his hands, which are bound together in front of him with rope. a rolled up, dirty rag is tied tightly around his head, stretched across his mouth. dried blood stains his hair and forehead. we see that he is lying in an old fashioned, wooden coffin. nothing more than a few rotted out planks of wood nailed together. realizing the same, paul is struck by an overwhelming, instant panic. with great difficulty, and while still holding the lit zippo, paul removes the muzzle from his mouth.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what...? what is this?}
<A>__{his words become almost unintelligible as he flails about, though fear is understood in his every utterance. he screams aloud, but his voice is captured by the coffin walls.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh my god! help me!! help me!!}
<A>__{he kicks and slams his hands against the top and sides of the coffin, all to no avail. his violent movements cause small grains of sand to trickle in through the space between the sides and top of the coffin, as well as a small gap that exists between one of the coffin's broken wooden planks. sweat cascades down the side of his neck, dripping from his dampened brow. the heat inside the extremely close confines of the coffin is stifling.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{somebody help me! please!!}
<A>__{paul continues with his futile efforts to pry off the top of the coffin. the sides, the top, the bottom all are too thoroughly reinforced by the force of what surrounds the coffin. sand. it becomes clear to him that he is buried. he tries his best to calm himself, though he has trouble catching his breath. it takes him some time, but he eventually achieves some semblance of calm. getting a good look at him for the first time, we see that paul is somewhere around 37 years old. unshaven and physically unremarkable, he embodies the blue collar american everyman. he coughs. the minimal amount of oxygen in the coffin makes it hard for him to breathe. his eyes widen a bit upon seeing an exposed, rusty nail. he tries desperately to use the nail to cut through the old, frayed ropes that bind his hands. doing so is no easy task. the incredibly tight quarters makes his every action nearly impossible. after a lengthy struggle, the rope snaps. paul quickly frees his hands. a small victory. very small. the heat is unbearable. paul takes off his button down shirt, leaving him in a t shirt. his body battles against the walls and the ceiling of the coffin with every move he makes. he tosses his button down shirt down by his feet. his undershirt is drenched through with sweat. still trying to calm himself, but having little success in doing so, paul looks around the coffin. his feet, though only his body length away, seem miles from him. he looks at the top of the coffin, and then back at his feet. with great difficulty, he shifts his body so that his feet are pressed against the top of the coffin. he attempts to use his leg strength to push the top off of him, but it doesn't move even a millimeter. after several failed attempts, and with his legs exhausted, paul drops his feet from the top of the coffin. he lay for a moment in silence, followed by an outburst of crying. close to his head, on the corner of the floor, we see there's another broken plank. a small hole. he closes his cigarette lighter, extinguishing the flame. in total darkness, he continues to cry.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{what is this?}
<A>__{with his sobbing slowly subsiding, the coffin soon grows eerily silent. the sound of paul's labored breaths are all we hear, softened under the blanket of absolute darkness. after a beat, the silence is interrupted by a subtle buzzing sound. the muted sight of strange, blueish light flickers in the coffin, by paul's feet. he is extremely startled. the buzzing continues, as does the minimal splashing of light. it's coming from underneath his discarded button down shirt, down near his feet. he lights the zippo to get a better look. pulling the shirt away, he realizes that what he is hearing and seeing is the vibrating ring and display features of an older model cell phone. he frantically reaches for it, though the coffin is far too small for him to reposition himself so easily. to his dismay, the phone stops ringing. but, his efforts to reach it continue. he uses his feet to search for the phone. after some trouble finding it, he eventually locates it. clamping the phone together between his clasped feet, paul then painfully angles his body so that he can reach his feet with his hands and grab it. he is soon able to reach it. immediately thereafter, he flips open the phone and puts the receiver in front of him. we see that there is a text message waiting for paul on the phone. however, paul barely notices. the time on the phone reads 6:12pm. while the numbers and display screen icons are familiar to americans, all the words are in arabic. what he does notices is that the phone barely has one bar of signal strength. worse yet, there is only half of the battery life remaining. he tries to remember the safe number he was given. with the phone open and ready to be dialed, paul struggles to recall the information.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{come on, come on. what was it?}
<A>__{getting only two digits into dialing the number, he cannot remember much more and closes the phone. he wedges the lit zippo into sand, which is compacted against a small hole in the wall of the coffin. paul reaches into his pants pocket, frantically searching for something. he hastily removes a prescription pill bottle and a small, metal flask. both are not what he was looking for. he then reaches to his back pocket and removes his wallet. it's empty. his license, his credit cards, his cash and, most importantly at that very moment, a piece of paper with the safe number written on it, are all missing.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{no. where the hell is it? son of a...come on!}
<A>__{he screams aloud again, hoping greatly that someone can hear him. his frenzied maneuvering puts out the flame of the zippo.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{help me! please! somebody help me!}
<A>__{his words barely make it pass the coffin walls. with the cell phone still in hand, and laboring to reclaim the breath he just expended, paul turns to desperation. he dials the international code of 001, and then dials 911. a female 911 operator answers almost immediately.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<D>__{911, please hold.}
<A>__{the female 911 operator places paul on hold.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no! wait!}
<A>__{paul accidentally bangs the cap of the zippo against the coffin wall, putting out the flame. she quickly returns.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<D>__{911. what is your emergency?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<D>__{911. what's the problem, sir?}
<A>__{paul is so incredibly panicked that he has trouble remaining coherent. after a few sparks, the zippo is re lit.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm buried. you have to help me. you have to help me, i can't breathe...}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<D>__{sir }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm buried in a coffin. please help me! send someone to find me...}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<D>__{sir...slow down. what is your name?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{paul. paul conroy.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<D>__{okay, mister conroy. can you tell me your location?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm in a coffin. i don't know where. i'm scared. please help me.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{you're in a coffin?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{yeah, it's, like, one of those old, wooden ones.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{are you at a funeral home?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{no. i don't know. no.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{how are calling me right now?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{what?}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{if you're buried in a coffin, where are you calling from?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{a cell phone. there was an old cell phone in the coffin.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{you're calling from your cell phone?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{yes. no. it's not mine, but yes, i'm calling from a cell phone.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{there was a cell phone in the coffin when you climbed in?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{i didn't climb in.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{how did you end up in the coffin, sir?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{i was put here.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{in the coffin?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{yes. please send help.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{and you're saying the coffin is buried?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{i think so. it's...it's hot in here. i can't breathe.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{do you know your location, sir?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{i told you, i don't know. somewhere in iraq.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{iraq?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{yes. i'm a truck driver, an american. i work for crt.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{are you a soldier, sir?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{no. please, please listen to me. i'm a truck driver. i work for crt. i'm a civilian contractor working in iraq. we were attacked in baqubah, they...they...}
<P>__{(starts crying)}
<A>__{...shot them. all of them.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{they shot who, sir?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{all of the other drivers.}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{and you're saying this happened in iraq? the country?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{yes. please, you have to help me. they gave me a safety number to call, but i had it stored in my wallet and }
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<A>__{mister conroy, this is 911 emergency in youngstown, ohio.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{ohio?}
<C>__{female 911 operator}
<D>__{yes, sir. i'm not sure exactly how you called here if you're in another country, but if you'd like, i can patch you through to the sheriff's department.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sheriff's department? no...you don't underst...}
<P>__{(giving up)}
<D>__{...forget it.}
<A>__{realizing that his conversation is both lengthy and useless, paul ends the call. he checks the battery life on the phone. it still holds steady at two bars. he immediately dials another number, one that he can recall with ease. he again enters the 001 international code before making the call. paul then dials his home phone. it rings several times, so far unanswered.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{come on, come on. pick up. please.}
<A>__{after sitting through the agony of a few more rings, paul is met with the answering machine. the voice of his young son, shane, is heard on the answering machine greeting.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{thanks for calling the conroy's. we're not home right now. please leave a message at the beep. thanks.}
<A>__{at the sound of the beep, paul leaves a frenzied, rambling message.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{linda, honey, it's me. listen, i need you to contact the national guard right away. or the pentagon. tell them we were attacked in the diyala provence, in baqubah.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{they have to find me. please help me, baby. please help them find me.}
<A>__{paul hangs up. he dials his wife's cell phone right away. after several rings, her cell phone voice mail picks up. we hear the sound of linda, paul's wife, on her outgoing message.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{hi, this is linda. please leave a message. thanks and have a great day.}
<A>__{the beep sounds and paul immediately tears into his voice message.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{linda, it's paul. i need you to call me right away. this is an absolute emergency. call the number that comes up on your phone. call me at that number. if i don't answer, call the pentagon or the f.b.i. i don't know what the hell is going on, but i'm buried in a box...}
<A>__{hearing himself say those last words gives him pause. the gravity of the situation fully takes hold.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{...i can't breathe in here. make sure you call me right away. please, baby, please call me.}
<A>__{paul ends the call. he nervously looks at the amount of battery life remaining on the phone. still holding strong at two bars. he notices the flickering light of the zippo. it, too, appears to be using up small amounts of oxygen. he closes the lid, extinguishing the flame. total darkness. silence, save for paul's increasingly heavy breaths. he begins to hyperventilate. he knows that preserving oxygen is paramount, so he does his best to calm himself. the healthy swig he takes from his flask helps. he flips open the cell phone. the light of the display screen partially illuminates his face and some of the coffin with a blueish hue. paul again enters the overseas dialing code, this time dialing 411 information. the 411 operator answers.}
<D>__{411 operator what city and state, please?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{um...i don't know. the f.b.i., wherever they are.}
<A>__{paul reaches for his button down shirt. fishes for pens stashed in his lapel pocket, while keeping the phone pressed to his ear with his shoulder.}
<D>__{411 operator do you have a specific city you'd like to be connected to, sir?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't care, any city. just connect me to the f.b.i. 411 operator sir, i have f.b.i. field offices listed in boston, new york, philadelphia, new haven, los angeles, chicago, denver }
<A>__{paul cannot bear to listen any further to this list that seemingly never ends.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{anywhere! any city, just connect me, please! 411 operator i'm sorry, sir, but i'm not allowed to do that.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{fine, um...chicago. okay? 411 operator please hold for your number.}
<A>__{paul is transferred to an automated message.}
<C>__{automated message}
<D>__{the number you requested, 312 421 6700...}
<A>__{paul writes the digits of the phone number on the top of the coffin with his pen. but, after the first three numbers, the pen stops working. he hurriedly reaches back into his shirt pocket to remove the other pen, which is actually a click up pencil. click click click click. he writes the last seven digits, followed by the word "fbi."}
<C>__{automated message }
<D>__{...can be connected for an additional charge of twenty five cents by pressing the number one.}
<A>__{he presses the number one and is connected directly. after a few rings, special agent harris answers.}
<C>__{special agent harris}
<D>__{chicago field office. special agent harris.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hello? is this the f.b.i.?}
<C>__{special agent harris}
<D>__{yes it is, sir.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm calling from iraq. i'm buried in the desert somewhere. i need you to help me }
<C>__{special agent harris}
<D>__{whoa, whoa, sir. slow down. when were you in iraq?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{now. i'm there now. i'm a truck driver for crt. i've been here for nine months.}
<C>__{special agent harris}
<D>__{may i have your name please, sir?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{paul conroy.}
<C>__{special agent harris}
<P>__{(saying it as he writes it down)}
<D>__{paul conroy.}
<P>__{(back on the phone)}
<D>__{okay, paul, explain to me what's going on.}
<A>__{paul attempts to center himself so that he can accurately tell his story.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{alright. me and a convoy of other drivers were delivering kitchen parts to a community center. as we got closer, a bunch of kids started throwing rocks at our trucks. then an ied went off up ahead and blew up one of the other trucks. these guys came out from behind the houses with guns and started shooting everybody right there on the street.}
<C>__{special agent harris}
<D>__{were you shot at?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't know!}
<P>__{(after a breath, calmer)}
<D>__{i don't know. i was way in the back of the convoy. i must have got hit in the head with one of the rocks and got knocked out. that's the last thing i remember. but now i just woke up, and i was tied up and buried in a coffin.}
<C>__{special agent harris}
<D>__{who put you there?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i guess whoever ambushed us.}
<A>__{special agent harris sounds slightly skeptical of paul's claims.}
<C>__{special agent harris}
<D>__{a bunch of kids?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, you're not listening. the kids threw the rocks at us, but then some iraqi guys maybe insurgents, i don't fucking know popped out of nowhere and started shooting at us.}
<C>__{special agent harris}
<D>__{i thought you said they didn't shoot at you.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{they didn't, i don't know! but they shot them!}
<C>__{special agent harris}
<D>__{sir, you're going to have to stop shouting if }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm shouting because you're not listening! i need you to help me! please!!}
<C>__{special agent harris}
<D>__{hmmm...}
<A>__{paul takes a moment to center himself.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{can you trace my call? gps or something?}
<C>__{special agent harris}
<D>__{why is it that they didn't shoot you?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i have no idea. they didn't, that's all i know.}
<C>__{special agent harris}
<D>__{what's your social security number, paul?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{why? who cares? i'm buried in the middle of the fucking desert! who cares what my social security number is?! i'm an american citizen. just send someone to find me!}
<C>__{special agent harris}
<D>__{do you know where you're ...lo...if...dy..}
<A>__{the cell phone starts breaking up.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hello? what? i can't hear you.}
<C>__{special agent harris}
<D>__{bet...un...near...}
<A>__{suddenly, special agent harris is not heard at all.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hello?! hello?!}
<A>__{paul checks the phone's display, where he sees that the call has been lost.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{shit!!}
<A>__{cell phone service temporarily goes down. paul lights the zippo to help him see the cell phone screen. he tries to make a call, but nothing happens. he shakes the phone, moves it around the coffin, all in desperate hope that he will get a signal. he soon does. he looks at the number for the f.b.i. that he has written on the wall, thinking about calling them back. he then checks the battery life on his phone, which remains at two bars. paul then decides to make a different call, this time to a phone number he has committed to memory: his employer back in the u.s., crestin, roland and thomas (crt). he closes the lid of the zippo, extinguishing the flame. after a few rings, a crt operator answers.}
<C>__{crt operator}
<D>__{thank you for calling crestin, roland and thomas. how may i direct your call?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{somebody, i need to talk to someone right away. it's an emergency.}

<D>__{who took it, sir?}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{personnel? no, i need to talk }
<A>__{paul is placed on hold. synthesized soft rock plays in the background of the phone, maddening paul further. over the music, a crt spokesman is heard, speaking a recorded testimonial during the on hold message.}
<C>__{crt spokesman}
<D>__{at crt, we work with our clients to provide effective and sustainable solutions to the challenges they face in our fast growing, global economy. as the premiere...}

<D>__{...fuck.}
<A>__{paul drops the phone to his side, the screen still emitting its glow. he explodes with a mixture of rage and fear. he screams and flails his feet and hands wildly, banging them against the walls of the coffin. his animalistic outburst causes the phone to close. the coffin returns to pitch black. after a long beat, paul lights the zippo, which remains wedged in the sand compacted against the small hole in the wall of the coffin. paul takes a few moments to catch his breath. he looks again at the cell phone. remembers receiving a text message. the icon on the phone's display indicates that he does, in fact, have an unread text message waiting for him. paul quickly scrolls through the phone's menu, which is all written in arabic, until he reaches what appears to be the text message option. opening it, he sees a series of ten numbers. using his click up pencil, he scribbles the numbers onto the top of the coffin. next to the number, he writes the word "help?" noticing that his phone has again picked up a signal, he dials the number. it rings once, but then the reception begins to falter. after only two rings, the call is ended. paul's frustration mounts. he is barely able to fight off another fit of hysterics. he dials the number again. it rings once. a second ring. in the middle of the third ring, someone answers but they do not say anything.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hello? hello? is anyone there? hello?}
