<L>__{exterior countryside morning}
<A>__{it's perfectly still. we are looking down an empty two lane road covered with fresh snow. we see the girls slowly riding out of the woods, talking. they cross the road and start up into the woods on the other side... they are trying to sing a liz phair song, "chopsticks"}
<D>__{grace judith}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"i met him at a party and he told me how he like to drive me home... he said he liked to do it backwards..."}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"... i said it "}
<C>__{judith}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"... and i said that"...}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(stops singing)}
<D>__{no, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do "...}
<A>__{suddenly there's the sound of the metal of judith's horse scraping on some sheer ice hidden under the soft snow. judith notices first...}
<C>__{judith}
<D>__{what was }
<A>__{the horse staggers... judith looks to grace }
<C>__{judith}
<D>__{grace!}
<A>__{the horse tries to find tracing with his hindfeet, kicking up sprays of snow and ice shards. the horse suddenly falls on the ice and goes down hard on its knees...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{judith!}
<A>__{the horse stumbles to get back on its feet, slipping again. frightened, it rears and judith, caught off balance, is thrown, her foot catching in the stirrup...}
<C>__{judith}
<D>__{graaace!}
<A>__{her horse, unable to find its balance, starts to slide backward down the incline.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{pilgrim, come on! move!}
<A>__{grace, directly behind judith, tries to turn pilgrim to avoid being hit by the errant horse. what follows, we see from grace's perspective. the details that form the images and sounds of grace's mind are fast, disembodies, almost surreal as judith's horse bulldozes into pilgrim, taking his legs out from under him, sending both horses careening down the icy slope. grace hangs onto pilgrim's neck. judith, her leg helplessly tangled in the stirrup, is dragged, her head bouncing on the frozen ground. they slide all the way back down to the country road. pilgrim is the first to find his legs and stand. grace manages to sit up in the saddle. she sees judith's horse stumbling back onto its feet, one of his legs broken at the ankles, walking in confused circles, dragging judith her face bleeding, her leg hanging from the stirrup.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{jude, you okay?}
<C>__{judith}
<P>__{(softly, crying)}
<D>__{i'm okay... i'm okay.}
<A>__{she tries to extricate her leg from the stirrup. grace sees it before she hears it. a glint off of steel. we then hear the rumbling sound of a truck coming around the bend... the girls on their horses in the middle of the road... the truck, an 18 wheeler carrying logging equipment, comes around the turn... grace grabs the bridle, trying to get judith's horse out of the road... the driver, seeing them, lays on the air horn. the horses bolt at the sound, the bridle slipping out of grace's hand...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{juude!!!}
<A>__{... the horses turn apart. the driver starts furiously downshifting, trying to brake... he seems to get it under control when suddenly the truck skids on some ice. it begins to slide, out of control, the truck bed and the cab jack knifing. the truck literally plows over the helpless judith and her horse the horse going down on the pavement, judith disappearing under him. the truck's cab, like a mythic monster, heads right for grace and pilgrim... grace looks right into the driver's helpless, frightened eyes... suddenly, pilgrim rears up at the truck, sending grace flying, bouncing her off the pavement and under the wheel of the truck. pilgrim instinctively jumps onto the hood of the truck, his hooves caught between the rear view mirrors like some grotesque ornament. his head and chest slams into the window, shattering through the glass. and then it is still. the truck has stopped halfway in the road. judith's horse lies in the road, motionless. pilgrim, on the truck's hood, his legs splayed, stuck, his head and chest, bleeding. he shrieks, struggling to get to his feet. he manages to free his legs and, stepping off the cab onto the road, walks off, wounded, in pain, into the sanctuary of the woods... the driver stumbles out of the cab, his head bleeding, in shock. he sits on the ground. all we hear is the sound of the river and the wind in the trees. grace, halfway under the truck, frozen, stares up at the beautiful morning sky.}
<B>__{we hear the sound of a helicopter...}
