<L>__{ext corner of allen & 5th street (stagecoach) day}
<A>__{later. wyatt walks up to his brothers at the corner.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{well we're off and running. just acquired us a quarter interest in the game at the oriental.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{acquired?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{so to speak.}
<A>__{down the block, unseen by the earps, a wild eyed tyler is advancing on them with a sawed off shotgun. he is within 20 feet when suddenly:}
<C>__{o.s. voice}
<D>__{why johnny tyler, you madcap, where are you going with that shotgun?}
<A>__{tyler spins around to see doc standing in a doorway, smiling. tyler freezes.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{doc. i didn't know you were in town.}
<A>__{wyatt spots doc and walks up, brothers in tow. though they don't so much as shake hands, we sense a strong bond between the 2 men.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{doc! how the hell are you?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{perfect, wyatt. simply perfect.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{wyatt? wyatt earp?}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{going into business for ourselves. wyatt just got us a faro game.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{since when is faro a business?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{didn't you always say gambling's an honest trade?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i said poker's an honest trade. only suckers buck the tiger. the odds are all with the house.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{depends how you look at it. i mean it's not like anybody's holding a gun to their heads.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{that's what i love about wyatt. he can talk himself into anything.}
<A>__{they laugh. frozen there. tyler begins to tremble. finally:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{oh sorry, johnny, i forgot all about you. you can go now. just leave the shotgun.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{tyler scuttles off as behan approaches affably. doc sniffs.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{sheriff behan, doc holliday.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{forgive me if i don't shake hands.}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{so how's tombstone treating you?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{fine, fine. but i was thinkin', you know what this town really needs is a race track.}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{actually, you know, that's not a bad idea, send a signal we're growing up.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{little ahead of yourselves, aren't you? this is just a mining camp.}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{see how everyone dresses? awfully toney for a mining camp. no, the die's cast, we're growing, be as big as san francisco in a few years. and just as sophisticated.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i can hardly wait.}
<A>__{as if on cue, a bullet whizzes past behan's head. everyone ducks. more gunfire as a man holding a bloody hand to his throat reels out the door of the nearby crystal palace, his gun firing wildly like a sputtering engine before he pitches face first onto the sidewalk, dead. immediately 2 more men appear: a staggering drunk with a bullet hole in his shoulder; and turkey creek jack johnson, a leathery plainsman with his gun at the ready. a crowd forms as the drunk raises his pistol, bellowing.}
<C>__{drunk}
<D>__{you son of a bitch!}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{that's right, keep comin', keep comin'...}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(turns to behan)}
<D>__{very cosmopolitan.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i know him. that's creek johnson.}
<A>__{suddenly a 3rd man, texas jack vermillion, long haired, hawk nosed, appears, pistol at the ready, keeping bystanders at bay.}
<C>__{vermillion}
<D>__{easy, gents. private affair...}
<P>__{(spots wyatt)}
<D>__{wyatt! doc! hey!}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{jack...}
<C>__{drunk}
<D>__{you bastard!}
<A>__{the drunk now has raised his gun to where it's almost level and:}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{yeah, good. right about there.}
<A>__{johnson fires. the drunk drops in a heap. johnson spots wyatt:}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{hello, wyatt! hiya doc!}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{what was that all about?}
<C>__{vermillion}
<D>__{drunks. crawfished a bet, called him a liar. i saw the whole thing.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(turns to behan)}
<D>__{sheriff, may i present a pair of fellow sophisticates, turkey creek jack johnson and texas jack vermillion? watch your ear, creek.}
<A>__{doc points to his bloody ear. johnson touches it, sees the blood, gives a silent start. just then white arrives, looking weary, facing johnson and vermillion.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{'fraid i will have to have those guns.}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{fair fight. we were legal.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{sorry, boys. gotta take you before judge spicer.}
<C>__{vermillion}
<D>__{well law and order every time, that's us.}
<A>__{they hand over their guns while virgil looks at the 2 dead men lying in the street, shaking his head:}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{what kinda town is this?}
<C>__{vermillion}
<D>__{nice scenery.}
<A>__{they look. a stagecoach stops in the street. josephine marcus looks out the window, her little white dog under her chin. she and wyatt spot each other instantly, both impressed.}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{that must be the theatrical troupe. there's a show tonight at schieffelin hall.}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{hey, wyatt, you goin' to the show? maybe we'll see you there.}
<P>__{(turns to white)}
<D>__{won't we.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{yeah, probably.}
<A>__{white leads them off to jail. wyatt and josephine hold each other's gaze as the coach drives on. doc smiles:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{well, an enchanted moment}
