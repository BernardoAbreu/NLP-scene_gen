<L>__{exterior tudor's balcony night}
<A>__{tudor hangs on to the railing of the narrow concrete balcony, gulping down the air, scanning the lights of the tower opposite. suddenly the muscles of his neck go tense again, his mouth seems to gape open at the extreme limits imposed by muscle and jawbone, his hands fly up to his mouth in an attempt to keep down whatever is about to come up. hanging over the railing of the balcony like an ocean traveler in a rough sea, tudor finally gives up the struggle and hangs on for dear life as he retches, gags, moans, and finally vomits.}
