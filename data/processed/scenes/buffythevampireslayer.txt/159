<L>__{interior zeph's auto repair day}
<A>__{pike is at work on a contraption. built out of scraps and parts, it is the beginnings of a cartridge load crossbow. zeph watches, behind him.}
<C>__{zeph}
<D>__{hah, i'd knew you'd be back. didn't i say you'd be back? ha, ha, ha! you're sitting in your old car saying 'nope, i'm never coming back.' hee, hee! like you got anywhere to go. 'i'm never coming back' but i knew you would. birds got to return to the nest sooner or later. that's what i said. just like i told you...}
<A>__{pike pays no attention to this babbling monologue. over the course of it he takes a slim, handmade wooden shaft, slightly thicker than an arrow, and rubs it with garlic. he places it in the crossbow, take aim in front of him. he fires into the tire of a truck. the tire pops flat. zeph cracks up.}

<D>__{hah! shot the damn tire, dumbass, didn't even look, just going around shooting things, popped it flat, ya bonehead.}
<A>__{pike, still not listening, continues to work.}
