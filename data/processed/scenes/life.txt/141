<C>__{leon}
<D>__{man, you really bummed me out. that's a terrible story.}
<P>__{(looking at jake)}
<D>__{nigger, you crying?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hell, no! i just got something in my eye.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{it's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. just don't make a habit of it.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{hey, willie, what was claude's plan, anyway?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{nothing to it, really. claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue. they got a couple of crackers working there don't know their asses from their elbows. then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside. claude figured during the commotion, it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning.}

<D>__{you trying to tell us that's not ray and claude in those boxes?}
<A>__{willie starts to chuckle and sets his electric wheel chair on auto pilot, leaving the young inmates to guess at the truth.}

<D>__{what do you think about that?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. come on, let's get this over with.}
