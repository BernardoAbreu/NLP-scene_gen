<D>__{uh oh, freddy's picking his nose again gotta go!}
<A>__{boogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the nostril cavern. stormie watches the massive knife blade as it comes right for her, then at the last possible second she starts climbing after boogerman. she pushes past the disgusting blob of goo, racing ahead.}

<D>__{well, excuse me!}
<A>__{insert freddy pushes the knife way far back into his head. the giant knife spears boogerman in the back, running him through and spilling his "boogerman" guts out his front. stormie gives a little squeal as boogerman is pulled out, kicking and screaming. freddy withdraws the knife from his nose, peering closely at the tiny boogerman impaled on the end. he twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks booger man across the cell. boogerman screams as he flies across vast space, smack ing into the far wall with a giant splat! boogerman flattens outwards into a thin pancake of boogerman goo, his nasty head still alive in the center. freddy reaches through the bars of the cell, his arm extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to the deputy's desk. he feels around on the table until he touches the pepper shaker, drawing it back into stormie's cell. freddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his right palm and breathes it in deeply the specks of pepper becoming rocks that pelt stormie as she clings to life deep inside the nostril. freddy's face begins to distort, his nose wrinkling up the beginnings of a sneeze.}

<D>__{ahhh... ahhh... ahhh choo!}
<A>__{micro stormie comes blasting out of freddy's nose with globules of snot. she flies across the massive cell, headed directly for the splattered boogerman, screaming her head off. boogerman sees stormie racing towards him and he screams too.}
