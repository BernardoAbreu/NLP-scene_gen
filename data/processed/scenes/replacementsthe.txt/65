<L>__{interior blowup helmet}
<A>__{jamal and shane are examining the trip wire. obviously, they were sabotaged.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{bastards.}
<C>__{announcer}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{and now... uh, the rest of the washington redskins.}
<A>__{the rest of the team walks unceremoniously out of the helmet and onto the field.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior field day}
<A>__{boom! the patriot kicker puts one in the end zone for a touchback. the ball is placed on the twenty as shane and the offense walk out onto the field. shane walks slowly toward the huddle that's forming.}
<B>__{in huddle}
<A>__{andre and mickey lee are arguing.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{that's where i stand.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{no it's not.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{come on, man, that's my spot in the huddle.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{as he walks, we hear mcginty's voice in shane's helmet. yes, they do it by one way helmet radio so the filtered voice you hear is mcginty, speaking into his headset mike.}
<P>__{mcginty (v.o.)}
<D>__{all right, son, nice and easy now. let's run our ten planned plays, get a feel for the land...}
<A>__{shane walks into the huddle and chaos.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{... fat fucking nip! you don't know shit!}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{what did you call me?!}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{you heard me, you tub a rice shit!}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{hold on, what's the problem here?}
<A>__{andre and lee ignore shane and start pushing each other.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i'm gonna kick your black ass...}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{you ain't kickin' jack shit...}
<A>__{now jamal gets involved as shane tries to get between them.}
<C>__{jamal}
<P>__{(to lee)}
<D>__{don't be messing with my brother...}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{hey, hold on...}
<B>__{on ref}
<A>__{he's watching the play clock and when it gets to zero he pulls his penalty flag and throws it.}
<C>__{ref}
<D>__{delay of game! five yards!}
<B>__{in huddle}
<A>__{lee suddenly punches andre through his face guard. andre knocks into shane and spins him around. jamal then goes to punch lee, he misses and nails shane in the back of the helmet. shane goes down hard.}
<B>__{on madden and summerall}
<A>__{they look confused.}
<C>__{summerall}
<D>__{... i don't know. something seems to be going on in the huddle. it looks like... yes, shane falco is on his back. they haven't run a play yet but falco is down.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{this is not a good sign.}
<B>__{on field}
<A>__{trainers race out to shane, who is lying face up with the huddle standing over him.}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(clearing the cobwebs)}
<D>__{what happened? am i hurt already?}
<A>__{shane sits up. suddenly, he remembers what happened.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{god damn it! i am the quarterback! i am the only one supposed to talk in the huddle!}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{yeah, but he took my place...}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i don't give a shit!}
<A>__{shane gets to his feet.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{huddle up!}
<A>__{everybody leans in.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{if you've got something to say, raise your hand! is that understood?!}
<A>__{lee raises his hand. shane grits his teeth and nods.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{suppose like, you don't feel good. or you're hurt or something like that. then what?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{then you tell me before the huddle starts! okay, listen up: 68 blue east storm toss. on two.}
<A>__{jamal raises his hand.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{that's to the right... right?}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{no, it's to the left.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{it's to the right!}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{you better be quiet, shane, they'll hear you.}
<A>__{we do hear a whistle. a penalty flag flies by.}
<C>__{ref}
<D>__{delay of game! five yards!}
<A>__{shane throws ups his hands. on mcginty he's talking into his mike.}
<D>__{mcginty what the hell is going on?}
<B>__{on madden and summerall}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{well, pat, so far the redskins have minus ten yards offensively.}
<A>__{on o'neil he's in bed sucking oxygen watching the game. augustine sits with him.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{turn it off. this is going to kill me.}
<B>__{on redskin huddle}
<A>__{it breaks this time and everyone runs to the line of scrimmage.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{blue 68. blue 68! hut! hut!}
<A>__{on the snap, shane turns to head off to lamont but instead runs right into jamal who knocks him down. shane looks up at jamal.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{have you suddenly decided you don't like me, jamal?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{oh. you said it was to the right, didn't you?}
<B>__{in huddle}
<A>__{shane leans in.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{okay. let's try something simple. 18 red left slot open.}
<P>__{(to jamal)}
<D>__{that's to the left!}
<A>__{they break and shane lines up over his center.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{eighteen red! eighteen red! hut! hut!}
<A>__{on the snap, shane hands to lamont who sweeps left, cuts inside and picks up eight yards. shane is ecstatic.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{yeah!}
<A>__{and then a penalty flag flies by.}
<C>__{ref}
<D>__{holding! number 78.}
<A>__{shane looks at jamal who is trying desperately to hide his number. shane leans in with the next play. cochran, playing right tackle, can't resist.}
<C>__{cochran}
<D>__{you see. we should have prayed.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{shut up! pass. 22 solo right slot 'a,' y stick. on one.}
<A>__{they break and come to the line of scrimmage.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{twenty two green. hut!}
<A>__{shane does a play action fake to lamont and then turns downfield. wham! he's buried by three defenders. the ball squirts loose and the patriots recover.}
<B>__{on pilachowski}
<A>__{he's livid on the sidelines. as his offensive line comes off he rants at them. shane hobbles off past: the defense rushing onto the field led by bateman.}
<C>__{summerall}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{washington comes up a minus fourteen yards on their first possession.}
<B>__{on patriots}
<A>__{they break their huddle and come to the line of scrimmage. bateman is snorting fire. earl wilkinson (with smith on the back of his jersey) patrols the secondary and calls out the formation.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{wide right! you got wide right! check on the wing!}
<A>__{the patriot quarterback sets up over center.}
<C>__{patriot qb}
<D>__{blue fourteen!}
<A>__{bam! bateman runs offside and flattens the quarterback. penalty flags fly everywhere.}
<B>__{on sideline}
<A>__{defensive coordinator banes rolls his eyes. the ref moves the ball five yards and gives the offside sign.}
<B>__{on patriots}
<A>__{they come out of the huddle again.}
<C>__{patriot qb}
<D>__{green eighty seven!}
<A>__{pow! bateman dives offside again and forearms the quarterback, knocking him on his back. flags fly again. one patriot lineman makes the mistake of pushing bateman. bateman literally jumps on his head. more flags fly.}
<B>__{on sideline}
<A>__{banes is screaming something unintelligible at bateman.}
<B>__{on ball}
<A>__{it's marched downfield by the ref, this time fifteen yards. over this we hear:}
<C>__{summerall}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{i think the redskins just set a record for penalties in the first three minutes. we're waiting for the stats on that...}
<A>__{here come the patriots again.}
