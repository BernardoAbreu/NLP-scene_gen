<L>__{interior nick's tent later night}
<A>__{nick has set up a mini lab in his private, small, tent. the home pregnancy tests have been ripped apart. nick mixes some of the contents together.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{i still can't believe it. how does a guy go from an anti nuke activists to working for the nuclear regulatory commission?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{when you and i use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. but from the inside now i can actually effect change.}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{i never lost my idealism.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{and exactly what changes are you trying to effect?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{and you think this creature is one of them?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yes. the first of its kind. i found this blood sample earlier this evening...}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{blood sample? how close did you get to that thing?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i got pretty close.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{what else do you know about it?}
<A>__{nick finishes his concoction, adding the blood sample into it he takes the piece of litmus paper from one of the home test boxes and dips it in.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{well, we know he eats fish, he's of reptile genus, he's a burrower, he's amphibious and...}
<A>__{nick points out the litmus paper. it turns red.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{...he's}
<A>__{pregnant}
<B>__{.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<A>__{nick gets up and starts to gather his materials.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(thrilled)}
<D>__{well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{i don't get it. if it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?}
<A>__{excitedly nick begins to pace.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{the ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. that's why he came to new york. like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{nesting?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yes. do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!}
<A>__{nick moves to the front exit of the tent.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{forgive me but i've got to get this into the lab, to confirm all this. i will be right back.}
<A>__{nick rushes from the tent. alone, audrey can't help but poke around a bit. she opens one of his cases. taped to the roof of the case she sees... insert photos nick and audrey happy times long ago. they're both young and in love. audrey is surprised nick still keeps them. she's touched. feeling guilty she quickly closes the case and sits back down. as she does she notices a video tape labeled first sighting. unable to resist, she puts it in and turns on the t.v. the shot of the japanese cook appears.}
<C>__{cook}
<P>__{(filtered through t.v.)}
<D>__{...gojira...gojira...}
<A>__{she hits the fast forward tape and sees, the enormous footprints in panama. she fast forwards again and sees the beached cargo ship in jamaica. audrey is torn. she makes a decision, pops the tape back out, puts in her purse and takes off out the back of the tent. moments later, nick returns from the front.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{audrey? audrey?}
<A>__{a flash of lighting and thunder accents nick's confusion.}
