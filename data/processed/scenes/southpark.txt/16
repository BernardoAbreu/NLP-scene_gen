<L>__{exterior stark's pond day}
<A>__{all the children of south park are gathered at the pond for ice skating. the scene is reminiscent of the skating scene from the charlie brown christmas special. delicate snowflakes fall, children laugh and skate, and joyous music plays. the boys walk up to the pond.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{hey, where have you guys been all day?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{oh, nowhere... we just went out to go see the terrance and phillip movie!}
<A>__{all the kids gasp! dramatic music sting.}
<C>__{bebe}
<D>__{you saw it?!}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{how'd you get in?!}
<A>__{suddenly, all the kids are gathered around the boys. they're like celebrities.}
<C>__{cartman}
<D>__{hey! stop crowding us you shitfaced cockmasters!}
<A>__{all the kids stop, wide eyed. as if they've just hear the voice of god.}
<C>__{kids}
<D>__{wowwww...}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{yeah, you're all a bunch of ass ramming unclefuckers.}
<C>__{kids}
<D>__{ooooohhh!!!}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(to another kid)}
<D>__{we have to see this movie, dude.}
<A>__{the other kids nod.}
<C>__{cartman}
<D>__{hey stan, tell 'em about when terrance called phillip a testicle shitting rectal wart! stan? stan?}
<A>__{but stan is elsewhere, because out on the ice, skating gracefully, is little eight year old wendy testaburger. the heavens part, a choir of angels sing, as wendy skates around and around, performing a series of impossible triple lutzes, sowcows and what have you not's. all the animals of the forest deer, birds, bunnies all stop to admire her. stan's smile grows wider and wider. kyle turns to see what he's looking at.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{thank my lucky stars here before me now is everything i'd ever hoped for knew it in a word saw it in a glance the only thing i think i'd die for...}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{aw, god damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.}
<A>__{angle wendy spinning and soaring in slo mo. effortlessly covering every inch of the pond with her ballet maneuvers. stan is slack jawed.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i can't stop now my heart's awake i pray her arms my arms to take so this is why i'm ali }
<A>__{wendy finishes her routine with a triumphant hamill camel landing right in front of stan and spraying ice in his face and abruptly ending his song.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{hi, stan!}
<A>__{stan vomits profusely all over himself.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{ew! gross!}
<A>__{just then, another kid skates up, spraying more ice in stan's face. his name is gregory, and he is a very handsome eight year old boy, with golden hair and an open buttoned shirt. he speaks with a rich english accent.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{come, wendy, let us try to jump the hilly brush.}
<A>__{stan looks at gregory.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{who are you, kid?}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{my name is gregory. i have been wendy's counter cousin for some time.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{want to skate with us?}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{we've been skating all morning. and laughing and talking of memories past.}
<A>__{gregory skates away. stan looks stunned. finally, he tries to get wendy's attention.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{we saw the terrance and phillip movie!}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{that's nice, stan.}
<A>__{wendy skates after gregory. stan looks completely rejected.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{she's not my girlfriend, dude!}
<A>__{meanwhile, the schoolkids are all still gathered around cartman.}
<C>__{cartman}
<D>__{yes, i saw the terrance and phillip movie. who wants to touch me? i said, "who wants to touch me?!"}
<A>__{a small boy steps forward and tentatively touches cartman's arm.}
<C>__{small boy}
<D>__{oooooh...}
