<A>__{devil's kettle citizens are gathered around murphy pool, crying. it's a candlelight memorial for chip. their faces are weary and sorrowful. photos of chip have been arranged around the edge of the fence. we see a picture of chip and needy on the end. someone has brought a cd player, and the mourners sing along, their voices soaring.}
