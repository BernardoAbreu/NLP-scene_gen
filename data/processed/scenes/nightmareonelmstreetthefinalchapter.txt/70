<A>__{scott lies on the top of a set of bunk beds. jacob is on the bottom and already looks asleep.}
<B>__{on scott}
<A>__{he's still awake. maybe he's starting to believe some of jacob's ramblings, because he nervously fidgets in bed.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{freddy krueger. yeah, right. years ago some sicko gets fried and now he comes back to stick it to you when you're snoozing. stupid bedtime story.}
<A>__{he sighs, looks at his wrist, but his watch isn't on. then:}
<C>__{scott }
<D>__{hey, mr. creepoid, you still up?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{yo, jacob?}
<A>__{there's still no answer. scott rolls and peeks over the edge of the bunk bed. and jacob's not there.}
<C>__{scott }
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{scott sits up, looks around. and falls right through the middle of his bed, not appearing underneath the top bunk. he just disappears.}
