<A>__{ian malcolm's leg, badly scarred, is bared and draped over the end of a bench. two sandbags are fastened to his ankle and malcolm is lifting them, painfully rehabbing his injury while talking on a satellite phone.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{we leave in twenty four hours. five member team.}
<A>__{behind them, the sparks of a acetylene torch fly as workmen make modifications on several vehicles, including a dark green mercedes benz aav (all activity vehicle). the hood of the aav is up and the v 6 engine has been pulled out; a new, smaller engine is lowered in its place. to one side are two long trailers, connected by an accordion like passageway, like on a subway car, allowing one to be towed behind the other.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{eddie carr's handling all our equipment and he'll be there to maintain it. he's designing special field trailers now, top of the line mobile research units.}
<A>__{eddie carr, fortyish, is barking out orders to the workmen.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{no, no, look at the plans, henry, you can't place that strut laterally, it has to be crosswise, look at the plans!}
<A>__{from the ceiling, a large metal age crashes down, landing next to them on the floor with a deafening clang. they leap back and look up. a workman waves from a scaffolding.}
<C>__{workman}
<D>__{sorry, eddie! specs say it can't deform at 12,000 psi, we had to test it}
<A>__{eddie bends down to inspect the cage, which is rectangular, constructed of inch thick titanium alloy bars. malcolm hangs up the phone and walks up, joining him.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{any damage?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{minimal.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{"minimal" is too much. it has to be light, it has to be strong }
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. god save me from academics.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you are an academic.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{former academic. now i actually make things. i don't just talk.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you think i'm all talk, eddie?}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(doesn't look at him)}
<D>__{it doesn't matter what i think.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{is there anything we've forgotten? anything at all?}
<A>__{behind them, someone clears their throat. eddie and malcolm turn around. kelly malcolm, an african american girl around twelve years old, stands in the doorway to the garage, a duffel bag slung over one shoulder. she looks at malcolm and breaks into a wide grin.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{hi, dad.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{kelly! what are you doing here?}
<A>__{she drops the bag on the floor, and wraps her arms around him in a warm embrace. he responds stiffly.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{vacation. i'm all yours. you didn't forget, did you?}
<A>__{she pulls back and looks at him.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{did you?}
