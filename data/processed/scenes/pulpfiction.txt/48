<L>__{interior lance's house night}
<A>__{at this late hour, lance has transformed from a bon vivant drug dealer to a bathrobe creature. he sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn out but comfortable tee shirt that has, written on it, "taft, california", and a moth ridden terry cloth robe. in his hand is a bowl of cap'n crunch with crunch berries. in front of him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the cap'n crunch with crunch berries came out of, and a hash pipe in an ashtray. on the big screen tv in front of the table is the three stooges, and they're getting married.}
