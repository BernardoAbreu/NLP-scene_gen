<A>__{ricky emerges from the house, followed by the colonel, who watches his son as he heads toward the burnham house. his pov: carolyn waves from the mercedes, flashing an insincere smile. jane leans forward from the passenger seat and glares at us. as ricky starts to get in the car, lester emerges from the house in his sweatpants.}
