<A>__{the storm brings gusting winds and below zero temperatures. eric and corbett move through the storm in slow motion. both recognize the need for a truce in the face of a common enemy. the snow and wind cut through their clothing like razors. they poke around for dead wood with which to make a fire. the trees are small and healthy; little is found.}

<D>__{just gather birch. it'll smoke like hell, but it'll burn green.}
<A>__{awestruck by the intensity of the storm, eric tears branches from birch trees and piles them in corbett's handcuffed arms. they hurry back to the nylon tarp, strung between two tree trunks, flapping violently in the storm. hunching against the wind, eric pulls off his gloves and reaches in his pocket for some precious matches. his fingers are so cold he can't hold them, and he drops several in the wet snow. angry, he shoots a look at corbett. corbett is holding his hands inside his coat. he pulls them out and quickly takes the remaining matches from eric. crouching down, back to the wind, corbett grasps a match between his numb fingers and awkwardly strikes it. he holds the flame next to the kindling. it doesn't catch fire immediately. corbett lets the match burn out against his fingers. he tries another match. this time, a flame takes hold but could succumb to the wind at any moment. on his knees and elbows, corbett nurses along the tiny fire. eric can't control his shivering. he gets on his knees next to corbett and holds his coat open to further baffle the wind. corbett keeps his hands cupped around the flame, not caring that it's burning his skin. finally the fire begins to grow. relieved, eric and corbett look at each other with a glimmer of a grudging mutual respect. the fire, now unattended, is smoky as corbett predicted, but burns along nicely.}
