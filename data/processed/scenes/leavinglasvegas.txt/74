<L>__{interior ben's bar. la. morning}
<A>__{ben seated at the bar, a pile of bills in front of him. the barman sets down a vodka, picks up the empty glass and takes some bills, shaking his head in disapproval. the tv is on, some game show as before, and ben watches carefully, looking for a sign from the girl, but the show proceeds in its 'normal' fashion. the only difference is that the hostess is played by the girl in the bank. ben grabs the barman's attention.}

<D>__{it's none of my business, but if you could see what i see, you wouldn't do this to yourself.}
<A>__{ben is taken aback by the emotion in his voice. in his mind, cynicism and the desire to cry fight it out. he holds the emotion back, and looks down at the bar.}
