<A>__{he relaxes and starts forward again. we keep expecting it to happen, but it keeps not happening. then, as milt is starting back toward the door, two big, hairy arms come up through the floor bursting through two of those cracks and shoving the splintered boards upward and grab milt's legs at the knees. sounds: bestial roars. milt screams and triggers off the shotgun unfortunately, it is pointing straight up. glass showers down on him. he is pulled down into the shattered hole now we can see him only from the knees up.}
