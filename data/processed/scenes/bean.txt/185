<A>__{bean and david do the rest of the journey, in quick cuts along corridors in an elevator. a sense of expectation and excitement. en route, they are joined by elmer, the huge security guard. the three arrive outside a large oak door. elmer ceremoniously unlocks the door, all the time glaring at bean who swallows hard. a light turns green and a buzzer sounds. then there is the door to the inner sanctum. elmer stares at bean as he unlocks it. another light turns green and another buzzer sounds.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{as you can see, security's pretty tight in this section. nobody gets past elmer here. isn't that right?}
<C>__{elmer}
<D>__{not in one piece anyway. i see mrs whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother. i'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her. the vice president here will vouch for that.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you've known me five years elmer. when do you get to calling me david?}
<C>__{elmer}
<D>__{not my place, sir. it would only be a matter of time before i'm calling you dave. then where would we be? by next year, you're my sweety pie" and i'm "coochie coo". i'11 be back in 15.}
<A>__{he salutes, glares at bean and walks away. bean and david enters the room. bean looks warily back at elmer}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you think he's tough you should see the size of the hunk that works the night shift.}
