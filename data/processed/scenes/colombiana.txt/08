<L>__{exterior cat's home day}
<A>__{the man in the suv is on the phone.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{they said he's not home yet.}
<A>__{he listens.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{ok. ok.}
<A>__{he hangs up. puts his phone back in his pocket. walks up to fabio's men.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{change of plans.}
<A>__{he pulls out his gun, shoots them point blank.}
<L>__{interior cat's home day}
<A>__{as they are exiting the house through a rear door, the shots ring out. they see another black suv rushing up the street.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{back!}
<A>__{he pushes his family back inside. fabio runs to the window. sees his men on the losing end of a gun battle. as the men fall, and others run up the stairs firing as they retreat toward the front door...}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{too late. get ready!}
<A>__{the mother drops the suitcases and runs to the rear room. fabio comes over to the unnaturally calm cat.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{i love you very much.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i love you too papa.}
<A>__{close on fabio's hand reaches under the table where cat is sitting, takes a gun strapped there. next to the gun is a big knife. and then footsteps, coming fast outside, draw his attention.}
<C>__{fabio}
<D>__{alicia!}
<A>__{his wife runs into the room toting two big assed assault rifles. she tosses one to fabio. both of them take up shooter's positions facing the door.}
<B>__{angle on cat}
<A>__{sitting at the table, very still. watching.}
<B>__{angle on her mother and father}
<A>__{facing the front door, hands gripping their assault rifles, sweat dripping down their faces, chests heaving, waiting, waiting, to blow anyone who comes through the door to kingdom come. but they never get the chance because... bbbbrrrraaaakkkkkk!!!!!!!! machine gun fire shatters the windows on both sides of the room, tearing into their bodies before they even get one shot off. tearing the orchid plants there to shred. cat watches in mute disbelief, shocked, as her parents bodies are riddled with heavy caliber rounds making them twitch and dance like marionettes on wires. their blood splattering across the room, across her. and then... silence. silence so complete it is deafening in it's absence of any sound. cat just sits in her chair. and then the door bursts open and four gunmen storm into the room, their assault weapons trained on the only living thing in the room. cat. marco enters.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{you in the kitchen. you, the bedroom. you, the back.}
<A>__{the gunmen scatter. marco has his inquisitive eye on cat, who does not drop her eyes, impossible to read. one of the gunman strides over to cat, jams a gun to her head. cat does not move a muscle. does not blink.}
<B>__{angle on marco}
<A>__{examines the frame fabio dug the chip out of. angle on the gunman with the gun to cat's head he chambers a round, is about to pull the trigger...}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{hey! what are you doing?}
<A>__{as the other gunmen begin to tear the house apart, looking for something, marco strides over to cat. the frame in his hand.}
<C>__{gunman}
<D>__{don luis said kill everyone.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{he also said no names.}
<C>__{gunman}
<D>__{she won't remember.}
<A>__{he is about to pull the trigger.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{the gunman stops.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{she's a kid.}
<C>__{gunman}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{what do you mean so what? you take a kid, teach them, they have value.}
<A>__{the gunman takes his gun, lifts cat's lip, looks at her teeth.}
<C>__{gunman}
<D>__{i couldn't even get ten bucks for her in the street.}
<A>__{the gunman is about to pull the trigger again.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{are you stupid or what? here.}
<A>__{marco hands him some cash.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{here's twenty asshole. go do your job.}
<A>__{scowling, the gunman joins the others in ripping the house apart, looking for something. marco calmly goes to the fridge, takes out two bottles of water, cracks the caps, sets one down on front of cat as he sits opposite her. her hands are in her lap.}
<C>__{marco}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{remember me cataleya?}
<A>__{cat shakes her head no.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{i was at your confirmation. my name is marco, and i was a very good friend of your father. i see he gave you his medal.}
<A>__{alluding to the medal around her neck.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{the cataleya orchid. his symbol. your name. that's good. this way you will always remember him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i know this is a terrible thing for you to have seen.}
<A>__{all the while his men are searching, frisking the bodies of the dead, even tearing the heels off their shoes.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{some things are too complicated for a kid to understand. this is one of them. but i am going to try explain it and make it very simple for you. so you understand. now, you know who don luis is?}
<A>__{cat responds, shakes her head yes. her hand slips imperceptibly under the table.}
<B>__{close on her hand}
<A>__{touches the handle of the knife taped there.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{of course you do. he was your father's best friend since they're kids. he's like an uncle to you. you know he has always been good to your family, don't you?}
<A>__{again cat shakes her head.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{this house, the food you eat, the clothes you wear. even your school fees. all this comes from don luis. you know that?}
<A>__{again cat shakes her head.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{but when someone is good to you and you are not good to them back, then bad things happen. things like...}
<A>__{he alludes to the riddled bodies of her dead parents.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{this.}
<A>__{cat looks from the bodies and back to marco, no emotion in her eyes.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{i know you are a smart girl. you do well in school. so i know this is not too complicated for you to understand. am i right?}
<A>__{cat nods.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{good. now, your father had something that belonged to don luis. a little thing. no bigger than...}
<A>__{he holds up his thumbnail.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{this. maybe it was in this.}
<A>__{he holds up the frame, shows where the chip was dug out of the wood.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{do you know what i am talking about?}
<A>__{cat nods. close on cat's hand gripping the knife handle.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{excellent. do you know where it is?}
<A>__{cat nods.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{well, if you give it to me, don luis will be very grateful. and very generous. he will make sure that you are clothed, fed, and sent to the very best school. you will have everything you want.}
<C>__{marco }
<D>__{but if you don't give it to him, he will be very unhappy. and you see what happens when he is not happy, yes?}
<A>__{cat nods yes.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{so why don't you just give that little thing which belongs to him. will you do that?}
<A>__{cat hesitates for a moment, and then removes one hand from underneath the table, her fist closed tight. marco smiles, kindly. he holds out his hand.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{you are a smart girl.}
<A>__{marco opens his hand.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{and in this life, smart girls get everything they want. what do you want cat?}
<A>__{and just as she is about to open her hand...}
<B>__{close on her other hand}
<A>__{under the table, gripping the handle of the knife taped there.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{just tell me sweetheart...what do you want?}
<A>__{in a flash, the knife is whipped out and buried into marco's unsuspecting, open palm. driven with such force, the knife pierces through the back of his hand, and sticks into the table beneath; pinning his hand. marco wants to scream but there is so much pain, nothing escapes his throat.}
<C>__{cat}
<P>__{(in his ear)}
<D>__{to kill don luis!}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{aaarrrggghhhh!!!!!}
<A>__{the men searching look up, and before they can react, cat races past them.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{get her!}
<B>__{track with cat}
<A>__{as she runs through the rooms of the house, sprints to the bathroom where one foot hits the toilet, springing her onto the ledge of a very small window. as she looks back, she sees the gunmen in hot pursuit. and she jumps, head first. barely squeezing her small frame through the tiny window. and she drops... six feet down, onto a ledge, that is just beneath the window. she flattens against the wall, holding onto the medal of her father.}
<B>__{on the bathroom}
<A>__{one of the gunman comes to the window, cannot fit through, looks out, does not see anybody across, then hears something beneath him, looks down, sees the tip of a shoe below. puts his gun out the window, points it down, and.... bbbbrrrraaaakkkkkkk!!!!!! lets loose with a barrage from his weapon.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she watches as the bullets split the cement all around her feet. coming inches from ripping into them. and then the barrage stops.}
<B>__{on the gunman}
<A>__{his clip runs out. and as he fumbles to slam another one in...}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she hears the pause. looks out over the sprawl of houses that stretch up and down the steep hillsides of the favela. she looks down at her open palm at the small chip her father gave her. pops the chip in her mouth, swallows, leaps over the small divide between her house and the next roof, and takes off running.}
<B>__{on the gunman}
<A>__{gets the clip to fit, sees cat heading off across the roof, out in the open, exposed, vulnerable. he lifts his gun to shoot, when the gun muzzle is slammed up, peppers the ceiling with bullets. the gunman turns to marco, holding his bloody rag wrapped hand.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{we need her alive!}
