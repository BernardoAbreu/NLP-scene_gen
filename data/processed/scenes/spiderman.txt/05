<L>__{interior cyclotron area hallway day}
<A>__{it is a basement hallway full of lockers which students are banging open and shut as they put stuff in and take stuff out. in their midst, a man is banging on the door marked "cyclotron room authorized personnel only!" professor rosomorf, sixtish, respectable, a good old fashioned professor, he's the head of the physics dept. with him is alexander thorkel, a 40 ish, waspish school administrator. for a scientist as crazily focused as ock, thorkel is a natural enemy.}

<P>__{(knocking furiously)}
<D>__{doctor octavius! you are late for your lecture. the students are waiting. doctor octavius!}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{your friend is impossible professor rosomorf, i told the board we should let him go.}
<A>__{the light above thorkel's head explodes. then all the lights behind him explode in succession. thorkel and roz look amazed...}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{what's he doing in there, not his crazy experiment again.}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{you mean his anti force theory... one day they'll give him the nobel prize for it.}
<C>__{thorkel}
