<A>__{a sea of glitter: the black royalty of america in their '70's robes. movie stars 20 rows back. burt lancaster is cosell's color man. frank sinatra is working as a still photographer. in the press section are plimpton types, schulberg mailer types, lipsyte, cosell.}

<D>__{...the contender and former heavyweight champion of the world, seeking to regain his title, from louisville, kentucky, muhammad ali!!!}
<A>__{catcalls and boos. the other half is a comeback sound. it is a nation divided: pro war right wingers, nixon supporters are for frazier; the anti war movement, celebrities, new york liberal establishment, blacks, puerto ricans and hippies are for ali.}

<A>__{the contentious roar diminishes only slightly for the announcer. ali's eyes deep in his focused concentration. his attention so arrow like it reminds us of the younger man in the liston fight...pure purpose.}
<B>__{the ring}
<A>__{...only silence as the referee's instructions are given in slo motion. ali bounces on the canvas. we hear his feet shift, turn, dance...and his breathing, expectant. here comes the return of what was unfairly taken: his heavyweight championship.}
