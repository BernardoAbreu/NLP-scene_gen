<L>__{exterior jungle day}
<A>__{winded from running, paul is caught off guard as a furious grant slams his back against a tree. only one thing he wants to know }
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{why did you bring us here?}
<A>__{paul is too startled to speak. udesky tires to step in, but grant gives him back a look.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{our son is on this island. we need your help to find him.}
<A>__{still crunched against the tree, paul pulls out a photo from his shirt pocket.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{this is him. eric. hes thirteen now. he's just about the greatest kid in the world.}
<A>__{letting go of paul, grant takes the photo, a sears style portrait of the boy we saw parasailing at the beginning. he shakes his head, disbelieving. he hands the photo to billy. the group splits into two sides paul and amanda, grant and billy with udesky stuck between. dialogue overlaps in places.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{he's with a man named ben hildebrand.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{her new boyfriend.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{a friend. we were vacationing. eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. they never came back.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we called everyone, did everything we could. because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. costa rica says it's a no fly zone, it's their own damn fault. guys at the u.s embassy our u.s. embassy said we should "accept the inevitable." you believe that?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{so you hired these mercenaries.}
<C>__{udesky}
<D>__{we prefer "recovery specialists." we do overseas custody issues and...}
<C>__{grant}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{then you duped us into coming here.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. somebody who'd been to this island before.}
<C>__{grant}
<P>__{(disbelieving)}
<D>__{i have never been on this island!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sure you have. you wrote that book...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{that was isla nublar. this is isla sorna. the second island.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(low, to udesky)}
<D>__{i didn't know, there were two islands.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. you saved those kids.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{a few of us survived. a lot more died. and we were better prepared and better armed.}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{how many days have they been missing?}
<A>__{a look between amanda and paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{eight weeks.}
<A>__{grand and billy are speechless. it might as well be eight years.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{after what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{he's smart, dr. grant. and he knows so much about dinosaurs.}
<A>__{before anyone else can talk, grant puts his hand out. he wants everyone to shut up while he plans their next move.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{no, i'm sorry, but no. we'll savage what we can from the plane. then we head for the coast. there may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{dr. grant, we're not leaving without our son.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.}
<A>__{with that he leaves, a beat later, billy follows. he has genuine sympathy for the kirby's, but he's logical enough to know grant is right.}
<B>__{back with paul and amanda}
<A>__{they look to udesky.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what do we do?}
<A>__{udesky is clearly at a loss, but for everyone's reassurance he tries to mutter some brio.}
<C>__{udesky}
<D>__{well, i think we should start searching for your}
<A>__{son. in the direction they're going.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{excellent.}
<A>__{they follow after grant and billy.}
