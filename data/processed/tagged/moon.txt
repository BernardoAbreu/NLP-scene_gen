<A>__{helium3 is a gas ejected from the surface of the sun and blown through space by solar winds. it plays an essential role in cold fusion, often toted as the solution to humanity's future energy needs. there is one major problem... helium3 is extremely scarce on earth. the gas does, however, exist in abundance on the earth's only natural satellite: the moon. should we turn to cold fusion in the future, it is conceivable that man will mine the moon for helium3 and bring the precious gas back to earth...}

<L>__{interior rec room morning}
<A>__{the sound belongs to a regular old treadmill like you see in most gyms across the world. running on it: sam bell, mid thirties, thick beard, handsome, striking blue eyes. sam's face is flushed and glistening with sweat. he lunges for a towel draped over the treadmill's bar, dabs his face as he runs. we see outside the window: a gray, powdery landscape stretching beneath a black sky.}

<L>__{interior comms room}
<A>__{his hair still wet from the shower, sam sits before a comms unit, dressed in a "lunar industries" boiler suit, a zip up the front, colorful patches sewn into the arms. he begins to record a message.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{tess. hi. it's me. how are you, sweetheart? it's the morning here. in a few minutes gerty and i will sit down for breakfast, go over the day's itinerary.}
<A>__{as sam continues his message, we are given a tour of the mining base. beginning with:}
<L>__{interior monitoring station}
<A>__{this is where you want to be if the shit hits the fan. the base's equivalent of hq. a wall of computers and flickering digital displays.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{today begins my 154th week on selene. i officially have two weeks to go before i climb into that return vehicle...}
<L>__{interior return vehicle}
<A>__{a small space craft attached to the base. it is essentially a tiny room with a coffin like, sealed bed in the middle of it: a cryogenic pod with an array of complicated controls surrounding it.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{and blast home.}
<L>__{interior rec room}
<A>__{sam spends most of his time here. it is kitchen and play room combined. we pick out a television set, an armchair, a ping pong table, the treadmill.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i never dreamed i'd make it this far.}
<A>__{detail: a wooden model on a table, we also pick out a large model carved out of bolser wood. it's a town. intricately done down to the tiniest details.}
<D>__{sam (v.o.) (cont'd) there were times, as you know...}
<A>__{we go even closer to the model, seeing that there are actual people, actual characters in the little town; actual buildings: a church, a town hall, etc. clearly someone has put a ton of work into this thing.}
<D>__{sam (v.o.) (cont'd) ...when i thought i was going to crack up.}
<L>__{interior greenhouse}
<A>__{and the tour of the base continues. onto a new room. a dark storage area sam has repurposed to grow a handful of plants. they sit surrounded by darkness, glowing under pools of artificial light.}

<D>__{in many ways, this place is all about contradictions.}
<L>__{exterior lunar landscape}
<A>__{the empty terrain surrounding the mining base, as viewed from the monitoring station window. across the landscape a mountain rises from the morning shadows.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{it's bleak, it's beautiful.}
<A>__{close up a hand tool some kind of rake or shovel half buried in the powdery soil, like a child's toy abandoned in a sand box.}
<D>__{sam (v.o.) (cont'd) it's barren, yet filled with riches.}

<A>__{of a slightly younger and clean shaven sam with his arms wrapped around his wife of four years, tess bell.}
<D>__{sam (v.o.) (cont'd) because i have you.}
<A>__{tess is a far cry from the stereotypical astronaut's wife of the 1960's 70's with the plastic smile and beehive hairdo. tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw droppingly beautiful. she looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave behind. note: in the photograph tess is visibly pregnant.}
<D>__{sam (v.o.) (cont'd) and i have eve. i don't take you guys for granted. you know that now.}

<L>__{interior rec room}
<A>__{a state of the art robot, a gerty 3000 known simply as "gerty" is preparing sam's breakfast. gerty is in three sections and moves along a horizontal rail that runs throughout the base. he has a readout screen that perpetually spews data. his hands resemble pincers, but are perfectly nimble. for the purposes of helping run the base and looking after sam, gerty is as good as human, if not better. sam enters.}

<D>__{morning, gerty.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{much better, thanks, pal.}
<A>__{sam treats gerty more like a person than a robot. whether this is down to gerty's intelligence or sam's desperation for company isn't clear just yet. note: gerty talks like a well educated older man. his language doesn't have a great deal of inflection (i.e. monotone) but he is friendly enough. sam switches a dial on a radio but gets nothing but static he sticks in a mini cd and skips the first few tracks. we hear brief clips of talk radio and shuttle through it before he allows it to play on, on some random american station an old weather report:}
