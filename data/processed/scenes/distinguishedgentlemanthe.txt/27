<A>__{a very puzzled vera johnson watches the ad on tv. series of shots night (mos) the congressional district sleeps. but in the darkness, a kind of d day onslaught is under way. quick super imposed cuts of tommy's secret army of silver foxes, opening crates, fanning through parking lots, swarming over lawns, driving in stakes, tacking up posters everywhere. include tommy climbing a telephone pole... armando shinnying up a light pole across the street... loretta and van dyke pulling on a rope... which hoists a huge bundle to tommy... who opens and unfolds it... and gets an end through the air to armando. they unfurl the biggest banner imaginable.}
