<L>__{exterior police station, montreuil day}
<A>__{as javert walks up the steps to his police station his assistant stops him with an urgent letter.}
<C>__{javert's assistant}
<D>__{from paris, monsieur.}
<A>__{javert seizes it, opens it, and reads. as he reads, his expression changes. appalled, he realizes he's made a terrible mistake.}
<L>__{interior factory, montreuil night}
<A>__{valjean is at his desk in his office, going through his papers once everyone else has gone, when javert enters and stands before him. he looks up.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{monsieur le mayor i have a crime to declare! i have disgraced the uniform that i wear. i've done you wrong, let no forgiveness be shown. i've been as hard on every rogue i have known. i will bear the blame, i must be treated just the same.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{i don't understand. what is this crime, javert?}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{i mistook you for a convict, i have made a false report. now i learn they've caught the culprit he's about to face the court.}
<A>__{valjean conceals his shock.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{and of course the thief denies it, you'd expect that from a con. but he couldn't run for ever, no, not even jean valjean.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{you say this man denies it all, and gives no sign of understanding or repentance? you say this man is going to trial, and that he's sure to be returned to serve his sentence?}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{he will pay, and so must i. press charges against me, sir!}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{you have only done your duty it's a minor sin at most. all of us have been mistaken you'll return, sir, to your post.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{must i do as you say?}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{it's your duty to obey!}
<A>__{javert is about to protest again, but valjean raises one commanding hand, to indicate his decision is made. javert gives an abrupt bow, and departs. left alone, valjean paces his office, deeply disturbed.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{they think that man is me without a second glance. this stranger they have found this man could be my chance! why should i save his hide? why should i right this wrong? when i have come so far and struggled for so long? if i speak i am condemned. if i stay silent, i am damned!}
<A>__{he goes out onto the balcony that looks down on the empty factory.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{i am the master of hundreds of workers they all look to me. can i abandon them? how would they live if i am not free? if i speak they are condemned. if i stay silent, i am damned!}
