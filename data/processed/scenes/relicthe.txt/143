<L>__{interior men's room museum night}
<A>__{a row of mirrors and urinals line the wall. it's a huge room, designed to handle crowds of visitors. margo ducks into one of the stalls as mbwun crashes in. margo looks through a crack in the door to see... the animal at full stop. it's staring at itself in the row of mirrors! the sight appalls it and the beast lets out a hideous sound! the claws lash out, breaking every mirror in the place, littering the floor with glass! then the beast turns and backs up, groaning, as if cornered. margo sees now that one limb is dragging, leaving a trail of blood. the mouth, too, appears to be bleeding. the s.w.a.t. team's bullets had an affect. margo presses back in the stall, bracing as the beast gets closer. it's just outside. it sniffs the air once and suddenly turns, rears up, furious and crashes through the bathroom door. margo screams and the thing grabs her! it holds margo up before it and roars. it closes its massive claws around her as if she is somehow responsible for everything. the claws tighten! she struggles and fights to no purpose ... but then the beast pauses... it's seen something! the necklace with two arrows around her neck! it stops and its grip loosens! a pained look flashes across its bestial face... and in that split moment margo looks down... a necklace of silver gleams around the beast's throat too! the necklace is the twin to her own! on margo... can it be possible? she stares at the thing...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{john's necklace! you killed him!}
<A>__{incredibly the beast shakes its head. a noise comes from it... a sad noise, like a groan. and now margo gets it! she can hardly believe it. her eyes widen in astonishment. she whispers...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{oh jesus. john?}
<A>__{the name is a knife through the monster's heart!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{no. it's not possible!}
<A>__{the last piece of the puzzle falls. the monster is john whittlesley! margo, still desperately frightened, tries to keep control.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{john? if it is you... i can help.}
<A>__{the monster shakes its head no and releases her. as she watches he moves away, quickly limps out the door.}
