<A>__{cinnabar gets into bed and turns off the light. pitch dark in there, can't see a thing. as she's drifting off to dreamland, she hears what sounds like the door quietly opening and someone slipping into the darkness of the room, we just stay on her face. it's cold in the place. and spooky. so she doesn't mind when she feels what she assumes is patrick slip in bed beside her. though we see only a shape sliding under the covers.}
