<L>__{interior limo moving day}
<A>__{for many of them this is the first time they have ever been inside a limo. julien pours himself a drink. sami plays around with the air conditioner. zero turns on the radio and clicks through a few stations until he comes to renaud singing "des que le vent souffera." he leans back in his seat, bobbing his head to the music. marcel doesn't like it. he changes the station. we hear johnny hallyday singing, "que je taime."}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{that's better.}
<A>__{zero doesn't like it. he pushes the button returning to the renaud song and stares at marcel. marcel, not to be outdone returns the hallyday song. like two children they click the buttons of the radio, switching back and forth between renaud and hallyday. bastaldi has had enough.}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{stop it! both of you!}
<A>__{he turns off the radio. a long beat. marcel, like a child who has to have the last word starts singing to himself quietly, but loud enough for zero to hear.}
<C>__{marcel}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{... que je t'aime... que je...}
<A>__{marcel sees bastaldi glaring at him and stops.}
