<A>__{it is very dark. close shot of a stack of deck chairs. two forms behind it a man's and a woman's. they are intertwined and motionless... suddenly a brilliant shaft of light is trained onto them. overlaid is a gentle, whirring sound. camera pans quickly to a nearby tree. close shot of the lens of a cine camera the motor purring... a blinding spotlight. camera pans to the couple the whirring of the camera is overlaid. the man leaps up shielding his eyes against the light. he advances towards the tree.}
