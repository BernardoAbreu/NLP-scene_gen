<L>__{exterior corey and pedro's house morning}
<A>__{the tow truck has just pulled up into the driveway. pedro climbs out and makes his way up the sidewalk to his front door, carrying a gallon of milk. emily climbs out and trails behind him, carrying her laundry bag and purse. the house is very small, with a front yard that is not much bigger than the sidewalk, and neighboring houses not much more than a body length apart from each other. pedro notices an eviction notice on the front door, and that a brand new lock has been placed on the otherwise run down door. he tries unsuccessfully to open the door. he walks over and looks through the front window into his kitchen and sees his dog. pedro taps on the window. the dog looks up at pedro, wagging its tail. pedro tries to open the window, but it's locked. pedro walks around to the side of the house. emily throws her laundry bag over her shoulder and follows him, frustrated with the wait. he looks in the window on the pantry door. he backs up and looks toward emily, blank. he looks back up at the house, frustrated. he about faces, steps over to the side of the neighboring house, unzips his pants, looks both ways to make sure the neighbors are not around, and starts pissing. emily shakes her head and heads back toward the truck, turned off by the whole situation.}
