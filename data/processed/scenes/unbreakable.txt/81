<A>__{a set of two unopened mab satin finish paint cans are dangling by their metal handles on the outside of each side of the weights. the fours cans sway a little as the bar is heaved off of david's chest. his arms are shaking hard. he raises the weight to it's apex and brings it down again. it touches his chest and rises up again. david's red strained face exhales powerfully as he straightens his arms. the bar lands on the armrest with a crash. the paint cans make metal squeaks as they swing to stillness, one at a time. beat. david sits up and turns back to the weights. his mouth moves as he calculates the discs and the cans. his lips stop moving. beat.}
