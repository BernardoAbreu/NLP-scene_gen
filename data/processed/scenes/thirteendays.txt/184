<L>__{interior situation room continuous}
<A>__{the room explodes, victorious. kenny and bobby break into big grins, grab each other. kenny pumps the president's hand. rusk and bundy slap each other on the back.}
<C>__{rusk}
<D>__{we were eyeball to eyeball and i think the other fellow just blinked.}
<A>__{the ruckus goes on for a minute. mccone comes back in.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{mr. president.}
<A>__{his voice is lost in the celebration. mccone calls out:}
<C>__{mccone }
<D>__{mr. president!}
<A>__{the hubub dies away.}
<C>__{mccone }
<D>__{sir, we have the tally from nsa. we have twenty ships stopping and or turning around. six, however, appear to be continuing for the line. including the gagarin and kimovsk.}
<A>__{the elation goes out of the room. kenny looks at the president. the president picks up the phone again.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{captain, have the ships you're observing changed course?}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{no, mr. president. they've just crossed the quarantine line.}
<A>__{bobby grips the edge of the table, immediately believing.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{it's an accident. they must not have gotten their orders yet. let 'em go.}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{unlikely, mr. president. we've been monitoring transmissions from both the gagarin and kimovsk. their radios are working fine.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{one ship, an accident maybe. six: this is intentional.}
<A>__{the president looks to bobby. he has no answer. kenny's mind races over the variables, and he leans forward, intense, suddenly understanding in a flash of insight:}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{they're right. this is intentional.}
<A>__{he glances around the room. all of excom is looking at him. bobby stares at kenny, too shocked to feel betrayed.}
<C>__{kenny }
<D>__{khruschev's stopped the 20 ships which are carrying contraband, and he's letting the ones which aren't go through, hoping for an incident. i think we should let them go.}
<A>__{bobby relaxes. around the table there are nods.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{if we do, it erodes the credibility of the quarantine. he'll just send more through tomorrow.}
<A>__{the president looks at kenny.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{then we deal with it tomorrow. but today he's stopped most of them. he's done something smart here. we gave him an ultimatum, and he's agreed to most of it, preserving just enough room to save face. we need to do something just as smart now.}
<A>__{bobby's nodding, following the argument. kenny looks around the room for support.}
<D>__{interior flag plot the pentagon continuous}
<A>__{mcnamara, pacing on the phone, jumps in.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{mr. president, i agree. let them go. four of the six continuing ships are still a day away from the line. they've stopped all the ones we suspect have weapons aboard. it would look bad shooting up a freighter full of baby food.}
