<A>__{looking back at adam with concern.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{so this is public transportation. my dad says that it becomes more and more important because of pollution which is more and more carbon dioxide and other hazardous gases in the air.}
<P>__{(then, confidentially)}
<D>__{do you have a gun, by the way?}
<A>__{the increasingly nervous psycho looks around, then nods that he does.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{well, thanks for not waving it around. and for not vomitting, for that matter. wow, we're really flying. say, do you know where i could find a grocery store?}
<A>__{the psycho shakes his head.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{i have to find that. and a hardware store and a liquour store and a standing holiday inn. although, i may not need the holiday inn. that's still kind of up in the air. it depends really on how things go.}
<C>__{psycho}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{there's a grocery store coming up.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{thank q!}
<P>__{(jumping up)}
<D>__{driver! please stop the bus immediately! i have to get off!}

<D>__{do you think i should get a gun?}
<C>__{psycho}
<D>__{i don't know...maybe.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(back to driver)}
