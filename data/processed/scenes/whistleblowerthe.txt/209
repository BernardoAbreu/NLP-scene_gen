<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{that's why i came straight to you. they were brought across the border by our guys. i need two back up security vans for a raid, with well trained }
<C>__{bill hynes}
<D>__{our resources are tight. i have to prioritize }
<C>__{kathy}
<P>__{(holding the border logs) this is real}
<D>__{evidence. and that's just a drop in the ocean. i have hundreds of files. photos, corroborated statements. we can build this case and get the perpetrators out of the mission }
<A>__{bill shakes his head.}
<C>__{bill hynes}
<D>__{if i could give you a piece of advice it would be to think of the future.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{these girls }
<C>__{bill hynes}
<D>__{are collateral damage. whores of war. it's nothing new. every conflict produces them.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{you know as well as i do, those girls aren't a product of the war.}
<C>__{kathy }
<D>__{they're a product of the peace. for the peace keepers.}
<A>__{kathy is repulsed. bill takes a seat.}
<C>__{bill hynes}
<D>__{this is your first mission. you're eager. but we work in a very grey area and that can get messy. everybody wants the un to take the gloves off but they don't want us to get our hands dirty. it's a fucking catch 22. so what do we do? we prioritize. we do our best and we always look at the bigger picture. you're a mother. fine. i see what you're doing with these girls. maybe that's why you're thinking with your heart not your head. but you have a chance at a career in the international sector. ride this out. get a promotion. human rights in liberia, afghanistan... i don't give a shit. and then, when you're running the show, you can implement whatever changes you see fit. but right now be smart and shut this bullshit down!}
