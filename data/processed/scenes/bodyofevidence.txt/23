<A>__{dimly lit. dark wood and leather. dulaney sits at a table with rebecca. she removes a cigarette and holds it, waiting for dulaney to light it. dulaney fumbles through his pockets and removes a book of matches. he lights one. rebecca doesn't lean forward to meet him. he must go to her. she looks into his eyes as she cups her hand over his. a beat. she lights the cigarette and takes a drag, then arches her neck back and blows a stream of smoke towards the ceiling. she does not blow out the match or remove her hand from dulaney's. she watches him as it burns down towards his fingers. after a long moment she leans in and sensually blows out the match and releases his hand.}
