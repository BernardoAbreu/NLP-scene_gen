<L>__{interior the blandings' living room night}
<A>__{it is dark outside and getting quite chilly. the children are unpacking a last barrel. they have made a rather unsteady pile of books and boxes, obviously muriel's personal effects. jim is in the process of trying to start his first fire in the fireplace. the immediate result is a clouding of the room with smoke. as he backs away, coughing, he bumps into the pile which falls to the floor spilling open a box which contains, among other things, muriel's diary and a lifetime accumulation of sentimental trinkets.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{now look what you've done!}
<A>__{betsy coughs her way to the fireplace, turns the flue handle. the smoke immediately goes up the chimney and the room starts to clear.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{father, the first principle of lighting a fire is to see if the flue is open. a three year old child knows that.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{next time we want a fire i will send out for a three year old child!}
<P>__{(indicates trinkets)}
<D>__{get that stuff cleaned up and go in and help gussie set the table. it's getting late.}
<A>__{the children start gathering up the debris. joan picks up some trinkets which have spilled from a cardboard box.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{look, dad, your fraternity pins.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(busy cleaning the fireplace)}
<D>__{pins? i only had one.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{there are two of them here.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{all right, all right. just put them away.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(examining them)}
<D>__{funny, this one says w.c. on the back. w.c.?}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{william cole! it must be uncle bill's!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{huh?}
<P>__{(reaching for it)}
<D>__{let me see that.}
<P>__{(examining pin)}
<D>__{hmmmm.}
<A>__{betsy has picked up a small leather bound book. she whistles.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{mother's diary when she was in college. it's slightly torrid.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(coming over)}
<D>__{let's see.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{that's none of your business!}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(scanning page)}
<D>__{i'd say mother and uncle bill were somewhat of an item!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(taking book from betsy)}
<D>__{people do not read other people's diaries! it's not a very nice thing to do!}
<P>__{(shooting them out)}
<D>__{now go in there and help gussie with the table.}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(indicating debris)}
<D>__{what about ?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i will take care of that. now, shoo, shoo.}
<A>__{the children exit. jim is about to put down the diary when his curiosity gets the better of him. making sure he's unobserved, he sits down on a box, opens the book, starts to read. as his brows wrinkle with concern:}
