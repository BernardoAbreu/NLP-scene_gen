<A>__{the perimeter wall silhouetted in the middle distance. lincoln and ester scramble through the scrub, blinded by dust, driven by momentum. as ester starts lagging behind, lincoln grabs her arm }

<D>__{ester ! we have to keep going!}
<A>__{but ester resists him, breaking loose from his grasp. lincoln looks at her, uncomprehending. until he sees her expression, the harrowed stare in her eyes, the labored heaving of her chest.}

<D>__{ester?}
<A>__{ester staggers back, losing balance, reeling as if spun by the storm. her eyes widening, senses flooding. the howling wind, the swirling dustclouds, the pendent gulf of black sky. her reel returning her to face lincoln, ester opens her mouth to speak. but all that comes is a scream. a scream from deep within, shrill and hysterical, the only articulation she can find. lincoln grabs her and covers her mouth. fighting to stifle her, rocking to her convulsions. but ester keeps screaming. a scream of everything.}
