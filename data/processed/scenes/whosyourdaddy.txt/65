<L>__{interior tecumseh high school corridor day}
<A>__{students hover at the bulletin board, reading a poster advertising the "heaven" auditions. principal merkin pushes through the crowd and tears the poster off the board. completely incensed.}
<L>__{interior city council hall evening}
<A>__{hundreds of xenia citizens have gathered for this meeting. principal merkin stands in front of the five members of the city council who sit at a u shaped table. he holds up "heaven" magazine. preaching with an evangelical passion...}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{this, my friends, this is not "heaven." this flesh rag is a one way ticket to hell! we must voice our outrage! to remain passive in the eye of the devil is like inviting him to a pot luck in your own backyard and asking him to bring the three bean salad!}
<A>__{his supporters murmur agreement.}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{for the sake of this community, and its impressionable young minds, i propose this publication be banned from our city!}
<A>__{his posse of supporters applaud. his opponents groan. ted slouches nearby. a lawyer next to him. the mayor bangs the gavel and the commotion settles.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{thank you for that long winded but impassioned speech, mr. merkin. i hope you can cut to the chase, ted.}
<A>__{principal merkin takes his seat. ted rises. playing the big shot lawyer. julie sits in the crowd, taking notes.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{with all due respect to merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. but he has no right to stop others.}
<P>__{(to principal merkin)}
<D>__{ever hear of the first amendment?}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<P>__{(rising; an outburst)}
<D>__{we cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{if that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. most guys in xenia have been looking at naked girls in "heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.}
<A>__{a bit of an uproar from the crowd. women eye their husbands suspiciously. julie makes a pointerior..}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{isn't it true, principal merkin, that you only care now because "heaven" is suddenly too close to home?}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{indeed it is, miss conroy! i make no bones about it! "heaven" has gone too far!}
<A>__{mr. needleman, another angry man from principal merkin's posse, jumps on the bandwagon.}
<C>__{mr. needleman}
<D>__{principal merkin is right! we can't let "heaven" violate our own daughters, wives, sisters, mothers, girlfriends, aunts...}
<A>__{helen motions to ted. he quickly locates a page in the report she prepared for him. he handles this like a pro...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i wouldn't want to name names, mr. needleman, or cause any undue embarrassment. but many members of this community have been loyal "heaven" readers for the better part of the last two decades. not to mention certain charter subscribers who have developed a voracious appetite for our video library as well. i don't suppose, "courtney leaves the convent" rings a bell to anyone?}
<A>__{mr. needleman dissolves into his seat. half the men in the audience seem to evaporate.}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{mr. nelson, you are beelzebub's henchman! you are single handedly destroying the integrity of our community, and i will not have it! i will gather signatures. i will petition the courts.}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(sheepishly)}
<D>__{you do what you have to do, dick. but if there's a man among us who doesn't like to steal a look at some pretty titty once in a while, let him cast the first stone.}
<A>__{the room is suddenly silent. principal merkin gives the mayor a hard look. merkin's face contorts in slow mo as he proclaims...}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{i. am. that. man.}
