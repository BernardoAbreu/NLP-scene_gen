<L>__{interior barber shop day}
<A>__{todd is standing calmly when toby bursts in }
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{signor, you got an appointment...}
<A>__{he stops when he realizes pirelli is nowhere to be seen.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{signor pirelli has been called away. you better run after him.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh no, sir. i better wait for him here or it'll be a lashing. he's a great one for the lashings.}
<A>__{he moves past todd to the large chest and sits only now do we see one of pirelli's hands protruding from the chest, dangling limply. toby doesn't notice it. todd at this moment, however, does. he smiles nervously.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{so, hmmm, mrs. lovett gave you a pie, did she?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{she's a real lady. model of all true christian virtue.}
<A>__{then pirelli's hand ... twitches. toby doesn't notice. todd does, stares at it anxiously.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{that she is ... that she is. but if i know a growing boy, there's still room for some more pie, eh?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i'd say, sir (pats his stomach) an aching void.}
<A>__{pirelli's hand begins to twitch more desperately now, perilously close to where toby's hand rests...}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{then why don't you run downstairs and wait for your master there? there'll be another pie in it for you, i'm sure...}
<A>__{pirelli's hand is twitching closer to toby's now...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{no, i should stay here.}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(a sudden inspiration)}
<D>__{i know why don't you tell mrs. lovett i said to give you a nice big tot of gin?}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(leaps up)}
<D>__{gin, sir?! thanking you kindly, sir! you're a christian indeed!}
<A>__{he races out happily and clatters down the stairs. a beat as todd gets his breath. then he goes to the trunk, leans down to open it, the camera follows him down and up again, when he rises the gentleman is standing right behind him! todd turns. the gentleman's face is completely impassive. he is not spectral. he does not disappear. he just stands there. todd looks at him. then the gentleman's eyes slowly move to a counter... todd follows his look to see... his largest razor. a long beat as todd looks at the razor. the point of no return. todd strides to the razor and he snaps it open with a sharp, quick flick of his wrist then he moves to the chest and with great ferocity he hauls pirelli up pirelli's eyes snap open and todd slashes his throat the piercing factory whistle screams todd remains standing over pirelli as the painful whistle echoes into music... we see that the gentleman is still standing there, watching todd...}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{his hands were quick, his fingers strong. it stung a little but not for long.}
<A>__{the dashing oxford student is now leaning against a wall, arms folded, looking at todd...}
<C>__{student}
<D>__{and those who thought him a simple clod were soon reconsidering under the sod...}
<A>__{the tourist stands by the window...}
<C>__{tourist}
<D>__{consigned there with a friendly prod from sweeney todd, the demon barber of fleet street. gentleman, student and tourist see your razor gleam, sweeney, feel how well it fits as it floats across the throats of hypocrites.}
<A>__{the last word echoes to silence as we cut to: a high angle shot of the room. the ghosts are gone. todd stands alone over pirelli's body. blood dripping from his razor. drip. drip. drip.}
