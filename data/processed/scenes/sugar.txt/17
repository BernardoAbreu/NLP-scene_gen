<A>__{miguel, sofia, javier (black, 22) jamie (black, 26) and alexandra (one of sofia's friends) hang out by the malecon (waterside), drinking rum and dancing to merengue that blasts out the open doors of a nearby car. the mood is festive.}

<D>__{i liked it too, javi.}

<D>__{he's right! all hail the golden arm.}
<A>__{javier and the girls drunkenly salute miguel's arm, pretend to dust dirt away, but jaime doesn't play along. he looks on, a little jealous.}

<D>__{you call that flabby rubberband an arm?}
<C>__{javier}
<D>__{oooh...}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{this flabby rubberband can throw 95. what can yours do?}
<C>__{jaime}
<D>__{i threw 98 in double a portland.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{98? then why you washing windshields now? i saw you try and bumrush javy at the stoplight last week.}
<A>__{everyone cracks up laughing, including jaime, as miguel grabs sofia, and leads her in a dance. his smile fading, jaime looks out over the water. miguel notices this. hold.}
