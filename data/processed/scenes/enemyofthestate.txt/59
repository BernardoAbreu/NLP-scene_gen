<L>__{interior tech room night}
<A>__{we hear a recording of the conversation between dean, pratt and bingham while we're close on an ink needle measuring dean's voice stress levels.}
<C>__{dean }
<D>__{he didn't give me }
<C>__{pratt }
<D>__{ otherwise we may have to }
<C>__{dean }
<D>__{otherwise you may have to what?}
<C>__{pratt }
<D>__{we'd rather not }
<C>__{dean }
<D>__{fuck you. you may have to }
<A>__{hicks turns off the recorder. standing with him is reynolds, the dean file and voice stress graph laid out before him.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{he's arrogant and threatening. voice stress points suggest he's worrying.}
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{hiding something?}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{it was in his bag. now it's not.}
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{destroy his credibility before he goes public. neutralize him. i don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. tell me about rachel banks.}
