<L>__{exterior desert rock outcrop later}
<A>__{in the open desert, a rock lands. then another. val and rhonda are throwing them from the rock outcrop. val, earl, rhonda, and burt have moved away from the main group to another section of the rock outcrop where intervening boulders will protect everyone from an explosion. earl has tied a bomb to some nylon rope form one of burt's knapsacks. burt places the other bombs safely out of the way behind a ledge. meanwhile, val and rhonda keep throwing rocks. soon, the ground shifts.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{there! right straight out in front of you.}
<A>__{burt has his coil of fuse.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{how much you think?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{i don't know... they're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?}
<A>__{burt nods, expertly eyeballing a fifteen second length and snipping it off. as he stuffs it into the bomb:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{what the hell is that, anyway?}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{cannon fuse.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{what do you use it for?}
<C>__{burt}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{my cannon.}
<A>__{the bomb is ready it's moment of truth. earl digs in his pocket for the lighter but val has it. val nervously leans over to light the fuse, but then frowns as he sees how earl is holding the rope.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...}
<A>__{val shakes his head and lights the fuse. earl whirls the bomb on the end of its rope like a lasso, and lets it fly out as far as he can. then he starts pulling it back in along the ground like a fishing lure. rhonda stares at her watch as they all sink down behind the protective boulder.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{come on...come on...}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{take it...take the bait...}
<A>__{suddenly a snout subtly surfaces and gulps down the bomb. a tense two seconds later kabooom! bullseye! it's a volcano of gory creature parts. they splatter all over! the remaining creatures shriek and race away again. the people cheer wildly.}
