<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{the sailboat racing across the dark waters}
<A>__{inigo is at the helm, fezzik stands near the body of the princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly or do they? vizzini sits motionless. the waves are higher, there are only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds.}
<C>__{vizzini}
<P>__{(to inigo)}
<D>__{we'll reach the cliffs by dawn.}
<A>__{inigo nods, glances back.}
<C>__{vizzini}
<D>__{why are you doing that?}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{making sure nobody's following us.}
<C>__{vizzini}
<D>__{that would be inconceivable.}
<C>__{buttercup}
<D>__{despite what you think, you will be caught. and when you are, the prince will see you all hanged.}
<A>__{vizzini turns a cold eye on the princess.}
<C>__{vizzini}
<D>__{of all the necks on this boat, highness, the one you should be worrying about is your own.}
<A>__{inigo keeps staring behind them.}
<C>__{vizzini}
<D>__{stop doing that. we can all relax, it's almost over }
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{you're sure nobody's following us?}
<C>__{vizzini}
<D>__{as i told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. no one in guilder knows what we've done. and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast. out of curiosity, why do you ask?}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{no reason. it's only, i just happened to look behind us, and something is there.}
<C>__{vizzini}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{and suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do }
