<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{meg, watching the monitors with sarah, gasps as she sees the man, whose name is harris. while she and sarah watch on the monitors, they see the silent image of harris, set upon by raoul, who grabs him roughly and drags him inside. burnham hurries to the door }
<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{ and slams it shut. he puts his back to it, thinking, terrified, things are spinning out of control, fast. raoul, in the middle of the kitchen floor, is venting some more of his rage on harris, whom he has hurled to the floor. he lands a solid boot in the side of harris's head, leaving him groaning in pain, completely disoriented. harris rolls groggily into the spreading pool of blood coming from underneath junior.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{stop it! stop it!}
<C>__{raoul}
<P>__{(turning on him)}
<D>__{who's the clown now? huh?! who's the fucking clown now?!}
<A>__{he pulls his gun, shoves it into burnham's eye, hard, we can hear the faint sizzle of skin burning.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{me. i am.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{burning me. it's burning my eye.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{i have the gun.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{remember that.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{raoul pulls the gun back, just an inch. the skin around burnham's eye is an angry red. his eyes dart, strain to look over at harris, moaning on the floor. and at junior, dead.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{what? what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{what do you think? get us into that room.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{i can't.}
<A>__{raoul pushes the gun barrel back into burnham's eye socket.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{you can. you're full of ideas. you just need to squeeze one out.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{i can't...}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{you got till the count of three. then you end up like him.}
<A>__{he tilts his head over to junior, whose brains are spreading out on the kitchen floor.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{one. squeeze.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{this is ridiculous...}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{two. squeeze harder.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{i can't just...}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{th }
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{okay, okay! okay.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{you got an idea?}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{yeah. yeah, i got an idea. i gotta check something.}
<A>__{raoul grunts, satisfied. pulls the gun back. burnham slides away, shaking. he bends down, to the floor. he looks at harris's left hand. at his index finger. he sees a white strip of skin, where harris wore his wedding ring, until recently.}
