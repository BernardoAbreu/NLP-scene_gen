<B>__{village square}
<A>__{swanscombe is gripped by the same earthquake. dodging panicky barnyard animals, valerian and her father join other frightened villagers in the center of town.}

<A>__{above the dragon's lair, boulders are shifting and grinding together. massive chunks of stone break loose and tumble down the incline.}

<B>__{galen}
<A>__{the shaking has stopped. rock dust filters down from the ceiling. galen picks himself up and stares: the door to his cell is off its hinges and is sagging open. he darts out.}
<B>__{corridor}
<A>__{galen dashes along the hallway, rounds a corner and stops. at the other end of the passage is tyrian.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{you little meddler! it's alive!}
<A>__{he draws his sword and advances. galen warily retreats. tyrian breaks into a run. galen turns and sprints away.}
<B>__{courtyard}
<A>__{unruly horses, terrified by the quake, rush blindly around the courtyard. hostlers try vainly to catch them. tyrian leans down from an upstairs window.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{close the main gate! quick!}
<A>__{the men below scramble for the gates. galen bursts out of hiding, sees the untended horses, and swings aboard as one goes past. a cry goes up from the guards.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{there! stop him!}
<A>__{galen rides like mad for the exit, but he's a half second late: the doors boom shut in his face. he wheels the horse around. the king's men are coming toward him with pikes. digging his heels into the horse's sides, he urges the animal back across the courtyard, up the steps and right into the building!}
<B>__{throne room}
<A>__{galen gallops into the empty chamber, knocking over the throne and vaulting a table. hot on his heels are armed soldiers. he kicks the horse again and shoots under an archway.}
<B>__{kitchen}
<A>__{the kitchen is already in chaos from the earthquake when galen charges in on his wild steed. food, utensils and cooks go flying. he reins in, ducks his head, and squeezes the horse out into a narrow hallway.}
<B>__{hallway}
<A>__{he clatters down the passageway. but here comes a contingent of footmen from the opposite direction. galen rides them into the walls!}
<B>__{stairs}
<A>__{the horse scrabbles up the stairs, galen tucked low against its neck. on the upper landing he comes face to face with tyrian and more soldiers.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{get him! stab the horse!}
<A>__{galen jerks the animal around and plunges back down the stairs.}
<B>__{library}
<A>__{whinnying and blowing the horse bursts in, a wild eyed galen still in the saddle. he finds himself confronting the king and his daughter. casiodorus grabs elspeth and retreats into a corner.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{tyrian! tyrian!}
<A>__{tyrian sweeps in with his men. the doors slam shut.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{so much for your magic! so much for your sorcery!}
<A>__{galen is trapped. just as tyrian reaches for the horse's reins, the animal rears up, rolling its eyes. at that moment the floor heaves and cracks in a new series of shocks. the men at arms go down like ten pins. tyrian reels back, dodging stone blocks loosened from the ceiling. as the shaking continues, a weakened section of wall gives way. galen sees daylight! without even waiting for the quake to cease, he prods the horse across the room and through the wall to freedom.}
