<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{patrizia, seated at a small table inside the cabin, is busy working on a complicated jigsaw puzzle, which, once completed, is supposed to represent a typically classical scene. one by one, she selects the various pieces of cardboard and inserts them in their rightful places. simultaneously, she is munching on some crackers spread with jam, and a piece of cold fruit. beside her is raimondo. he is staring at patrizia with such an intense expression that she becomes thoroughly annoyed and says to him, as she continues working at her puzzle:}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{what do you want, raimondo? do you want me? a few years ago, maybe... but now... and, then, at this hour of the day!}
<A>__{coming down the steps that lead into the cabin, claudia overhears the end of the conversation, and decides to withdraw. but patrizia sees her and calls her back.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{come, claudia, do come in... there's no romance going on here.}
<A>__{claudia enters. raimondo continues to stare at patrizia, particularly at her legs. patrizia becomes aware that raimondo is staring at her, and with a condescending gesture, she lifts her skirt a little higher to make him see better.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{there, have you seen enough now? are you satisfied?}
<A>__{raimondo nods yes. claudia is amused by their behavior but also a little surprised. patrizia calmly resumes her game and raimondo again begins to stare at her. this time, at her breasts. and again patrizia becomes conscious of the fact that he is staring at her. she assumes a bored attitude and looks up at the ceiling in a gesture of quiet forbearance. raimondo reaches out with his hand and gently caresses patrizia's breast. claudia looks on in amazement. raimondo withdraws his hand.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<P>__{(regretfully)}
<D>__{now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... but i already told you...}
<C>__{raimondo}
<D>__{if women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...}
<A>__{patrizia laughs at raimondo's remark and looks at him sympathetically. then she turns to claudia.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{tell me, claudia, what do you think of raimondo?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i would say he's pretty depraved.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{oh no; quite the contrary. he's really just a child.}
<C>__{raimondo}
<D>__{patrizia, don't start in again... i would rather be called depraved. unless you happen to love children.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{you know, i don't love anybody.}
<C>__{raimondo}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{i know, dammit, i know!}
<P>__{(turning to claudia)}
<D>__{and just think if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. well, anyway, she's faithful. faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.}
<A>__{raimondo has such a disgruntled look on his face that patrizia laughs.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{he amuses me. i don't know of anything more amusing. outside of this jigsaw puzzle. don't you find it so, claudia?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{one would have to be in love with somebody to know that.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{have you ever been in love?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{not really... it's suffocating in here... shall we go out?}
<A>__{claudia leaves the cabin and goes up to the deck. patrizia returns to her game, and raimondo continues to stare at her.}
