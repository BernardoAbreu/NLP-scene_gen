<L>__{interior multi purpose room}
<A>__{again we are watching slides in the darkened room. this time standard, roby, melkonis, and hunter are watching the sequence of photographs taken automatically by broussard's datastick as he probed the tomb. the camera reveals the "urns." the climax of the sequence of stills comes when the creature leaps out of the "urn" toward the camera and after that the camera drops to a useless angle and proceeds to show a series of meaningless blurs. then the reel ends.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{that must have been when he got it.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{the same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<P>__{(clicks back through the}
<D>__{slides to a picture of}
<P>__{one of the "urns")}
<D>__{at first i thought they were jars too, or artifacts anyway. but they're not. they're eggs, or spore casings. let's go back to the heiroglyphics.}
<A>__{clicketyclicketyclick melkonis accelerates through the slides in a blur, stopping at the one he wants which shows a strip of heiroglyphs on the wall of the tomb.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{i personally can't make any sense out of it...}
<A>__{click. click. melkonis is changing the slides as they talk, showing different angles on the glyphs.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{it's a crude symbolic language looks primitive.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{you can't tell that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{that sounds a little fanciful...}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{what common objects?}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{listen, hadn't somebody better check on broussard?}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{i will do it. the rest of you continue.}
<C>__{hunter}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{i will come with you.}
