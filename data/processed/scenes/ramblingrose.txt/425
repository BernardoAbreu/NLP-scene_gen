<A>__{a shot of willcox hillyer as he glances into the living room. the room looks the same but different it is musty, dim. willcox hillyer stares at it as if haunted a bit, turns and the camera follows him as he crosses the hall and looks into mother's old bedroom study. this room is quite different. the four poster is gone. the room is dusty, musty, dark. magazines are on the floor in a ring around mother's old study chair. we see "male" things. it is apparent daddy lives alone in this room. a shot of willcox hillyer as he walks down the familiar hall back to the kitchen.}
