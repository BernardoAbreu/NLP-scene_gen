<A>__{dead silence as jacob sees his own face staring back at him from beneath the mask. it is jacob singer as we first saw him on the battlefield in vietnam. only now his image is pale and lifeless. it takes jacob a moment to realize that he is dead. the recognition is one of terrible confusion and pain. jacob stares at himself for a long time as a huge cry wells up inside him. it bursts forth with devastating sadness. as that instant the whole of space seems to explode in a flash of catacylsmic power. hundreds of images from jacob's life flash before us, his birth, his childhood, his adulthood. the demons, the room, jezzie, louis, michael, sarah, all seem to assail us in a rush of blinding intensity. we are flying over a landscape of memories, zooming across a constantly changing field of images. some of the images move, some of the people in them speak. they are not particularly significant memories, in some ways they are quite banal, but something about them is infused with life and joy. even the painful moments resonate with vital force. some of the moments we recognize from the time we've spent with jacob. some we have not seen before. there is no order to them, no logic to why they have been recalled. a newborn baby takes its first breath and screams. sarah pulls clothes off a clothes line on a rainy day. jacob's father stands in the florida surf as sea foam laps gently at his legs. paul, frank, and jacob play cards on the edge of a rice paddy. gabe rides his bike into the path of an oncoming car. a child puts his ear next to a bowl of cereal, listening to it talk. a young girl standing in a doorway lifts up her blouse to show her new breasts. jacob and sarah slice a wedding cake that topples to the floor. jezzie looks at jacob and asks "love me a little?" and then it is over. total silence overwhelms the screen, a wonderful soothing calm. jacob's eyes open and he is shocked to find himself sitting on the floor in sarah's apartment. he is all alone. the first rays of early morning sunlight are filtering through the window. something about the apartment seems transfigured, magical. jacob sits motionless, stunned to be back there. the faint sound of music can be heard coming from the hallway. it is warm and familiar, the tinkling of a music box. jacob listens to it for a few moments and then something registers inside him. curious, he gets up and approaches the corridor.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{there is no response. suddenly the music stops. jacob freezes for a moment. he sees someone standing in the shadows at the other end.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{who is it? who's there?}
<A>__{tentatively jacob moves forward. as he draws closer he begins to see the outline of a child. then, all of a sudden, he realizes who it is. his eyes well up as he stands there, the full impact of the moment registering inside him. it's his son, gabe. he is carrying the same musical lunch box we have seen before. the young boy smiles warmly at his father. it is the smile of an angel. jacob swallows hard.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{gabe? gabe!}
<A>__{jacob runs to his son. unable to hold back the tears, he embraces him in a rush of love and emotion.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{gabe. oh god. i don't believe ...}
<A>__{they hug one another over and over. jacob, overcome, sits down on the stiars. after a moment gabe puts his arm around his father's shoulder in a gesture of surprising maturity and compassion. we sense for an instant that their roles have reversed. gabe reaches for jacob's hand and gently encourages him to stand up. with a sweet tug gabe leads his father up the steps. sunlight streams down from the top of the stiars, hitting the first landing. gabe is bathed in its warm glow. as jacob reaches the landing, he too is surrounded by the comforting light. gabe hurries up the last set of stairs. jacob turns to follow but is stunned by the brilliance of the light pouring in from above. squinting, he cannot see his son. then suddenly gabe steps back out of the light and takes his father's hand once more. his eyes sparkle with excitement.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{come on dad ... you know what we've got? a sandbox just like the williston's, only it's bigger and the sand's all white. you won't believe it.}
<A>__{jacob smiles at his son. gabe smiles at him. it is a moment of total euphoria. the camera holds as they continue up the stairs.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and my parakeet. remember, the one grandma let out of the cage? he's okay. and he's talking now. he knows my name.}
<A>__{gabe's voice slowly trails off as he and his father disappear in the intenstity of the light. the camera holds on the image. for a brief but stunning moment there appears to be a huge ethereal staircase shimmering before us. it rises up into infinite dimensions. then the brilliance of its blinding light overwhelms the screen. suddenly the brightness condenses into a smaller light source. it holds for a second and then flashes off. an overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in view.}
