<A>__{karl enters the mess hall, slamming the door shut behind him. he looks up to see, swinging from hooks, harpoons, lances and louchets. exhausted. freezing. he peers into the room. oil lamps flicker throwing shadows across the walls. pans boil on the stove, overflowing and spitting. a forgotten kettle steams, ready to whistle. the place is empty. then unexpectedly a shadow moves and an alien tail flicks across screen. karl does not notice. he moves deeper into the mess hall. forty bowls and drinking jugs sit on the long empty tables prepared for a crew of forty men that are nowhere to be seen. karl's eyes do a scan of the entire room but nothing is there. a blur passes in front of camera distorting the outline of karl. slowly he turns around to find himself staring at something we don't see. he looks up in horror. he backs up, falling over a table bench. he's on the ground. we hear a sharp metallic sound. in the foreground predator blades now hellishly frame karl as he scurries back. he can go no further. he's helpless. the shadow of a predator spreads over karl's terrified face. three laser dots scan across karl, passing over his face. in predator vision we see karl, he is frozen with fear. but then the image reforms and scans an area over karl's shoulder. there is nothing there. the image rescans and we reveal an alien: seen only in the snap of a few frames, nearly subliminal imagery. the twin mouths open and prepare to strike. the alien lunges towards the predator. twin blades on the predator's wrist come scything down. their razor sharp edges catching the light. straight toward the alien, but also}
