<LOC>__{EXT.   DERELICT STREET   TWILIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Night is falling in a forgotten part of the city. The street-lights are a joke - three out of four are dead. Only a large moon and some cloud-streaked stars illuminate this dark and derelict street. Once the hub of an industrial area, now the buildings are abandoned, the sidewalks choked with litter and debris.  Stores are boarded-up, windows are glassless, walls are graffitied. At various points, several BUMS warm their hands at trash-can fires.}

<ACTION>__{Down this boulevard of decay and despair drives an incongruously expensive car - a Range Rover. A rich kid is going shopping. The car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only open store on the block.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANGLE ON STORE}
<ACTION>__{A dim light bulb shines within - the only indicator that the store is still trading.  Its windows are grimy, its door defaced.  Above the door - barely legible through the accrued dirt of city years - a sign; CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES AND CURIOS.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANGLE ON CAR}
<ACTION>__{The side door opens - helped on its way by the kick of an expensive leather boot - and JP MONROE steps out. JP is 24, rich, handsome, and spoiled. His hair is slick with designer-grease, his slim frame is wrapped in a $600 leather jacket. For a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous glances up and down the ruined street.  He shows no anxiety at being in this twilight part of town.  Cocooned in the confidence of wealth, he's never felt threatened in his life. Satisfied he's in the right place, he walks confidently through the doorway.}
<LOC>__{INT.   CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES   NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The store itself looks like an antique - old wood panelling and shelving, Victorian display cases, and faded wallpaper.  It is grimy, dusty, and dimly-lit - and apparently unattended. It is packed with merchandise - shelves and aisles overflow onto the floor making the place a maze to walk through. The stock is a strange surreal mix.  Discarded items from 50's America (Norge fridges, toasters, Frankie Lymon albums) share space with older items; framed pictures, Victorian automata, wax dolls, and (a specialty of the store?) items of punishment; stocks, iron boots, chastity belts, whips. Could that really be an Electric Chair glimpsed in the shadowed back of the room?}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANGLE ON JP}
<ACTION>__{He wanders through the merchandise, casting appraising glances at some items.  Some he even runs his hands over - grimacing at the dust and grime they leave on his fingers.  But his manner suggests he is looking for something specific. Near the room's center is an old hoarding from the dead days of vaudeville and travelling shows.  It is tall and broad and is leaning against something behind it.}

The pillar is extremely bizarre, as if a New York avant-garde sculptor has interpreted a Totem Pole for jaded modern tastes.  The carvings are of dead rats, copulating skeletons,  filigree-patterned boxes, and faces. One of these faces - recognizable to the audience but not to JP - is the ossified visage of PINHEAD, the demon from the first two HELLRAISER pictures.}

Joanne - or JOEY, as she prefers to be called - is 23 years old, an attractive and clever brunette, with a quiet sadness in her eyes that she usually manages to keep almost hidden.

Two PARAMEDICS, both male, both about Joey's age, are pushing the gurney at a run and talking rapidly to each other.  They completely ignore Joey and also ignore the TEENAGE GIRL who is running beside the gurney. The girl - TERRI - is 18 or 19.  She is a pale-faced blonde dressed as if for a Desperately-Seeking-Susan party and is keeping up a stream of chatter as if rehearsing excuses. As Joey flattens herself against the corridor wall to let them pass, it is neither the paramedics nor Terri that get her attention.  It is the BOY on the gurney. ANGLE ON GURNEY/BOY The teenage boy lies flat on his back semi-conscious, his eyelids fluttering, his breathing shallow. Horribly, shockingly, dangling from his face and body are long, heavy chains that drag and rattle along the corridor floor. There are at least sixteen of them and they seem firmly buried in his skin.}

The boy's skin is stretched and pulled at those points where the chains are connected to him and it seems horribly possible that his flesh will burst if the pressure continues. The scene is held for a terrible frozen moment.  Then suddenly the chains drop, the scream stops, and the boy's body slumps. There is a massive ELECTRICAL SURGE.

Without shifting his gaze, he raises his hand and within seconds the BARMAN is leaning over to hear his request. CLOSE on Sandy as a full glass is placed in front of her.  Laid alongside the glass is a beautiful long-stemmed red rose. Sandy looks surprised at the drink and then smiles in delight at the rose.  She raises her eyes and looks across the bar. JP returns the smile. He turns to the Boy beside him and murmurs something unheard. The boy glances round, as if ready to argue with whoever is speaking to him.  On recognizing JP, however, he vacates the seat without an argument and stands to join his friends.

And the obvious suggestion is that what it is becoming is Pinhead. Pinhead's head, arms, and torso now protrude from the pillar. They are not completely free and - now that the "eating" of Sandy is concluded - seem incapable of independent movement but there is plainly a lot more of him than there was before.

Instinctively, they spread apart - each walking near to opposite walls. The younger cop is standing beneath a fire escape.  He glances up as if he might be able to jump up to safety.  No.  Too high. Pinhead's head flicks upward as if in a gesture of command. Suddenly, the Fire escape ladder zooms downward with impossible speed and force. The Younger Cop doesn't even have time to scream.

The Elder Copts shaking puppet-like hands draw his handcuffs from his belt. His eyes show terror.  Everything else is beyond his control. He raises the cuffs to head level and springs one of them open. His mouth suddenly jerks open and his tongue protrudes. The fear in his eyes increases. He moves the open cuff over his tongue.  He's making panicked moaning noises as if trying to scream. SLAM!  He drives the cuff closed right through his tongue! And SCREAMS (as best he can). Pinhead looks beyond the Cop to the wall of blackness and makes another commanding gesture with his head. A Chain flies from the darkness and wraps itself around the other cuff. The chain pulls taut and then suddenly retracts into the darkness, hauling the Cop off his feet and dragging him along the alley into the blackness. The Cop screams and moans all the way until he is enveloped into the darkness and then the sounds suddenly stop dead.}

The Priest is a young man.  Probably a good man.  We're not really going to have the time to find out. A shadow seems to pass over the Priest's bowed head. At first, it seems he hasn't noticed.  Then he looks up, a little puzzled.  He looks to his right, his left, then shifts in the pew to look back along the central aisle. There are rows and rows of empty pews and, in the distance, the Church door ... which is ajar. The Priest stands, walks to the start of the aisle, and looks back along it again.}

Pinhead presses the worm against his palm and it instantly burrows through his flesh pulling its pin-tail behind it.  He repeats the operation with the other palm.

Very slowly, very carefully, Joey begins to move round her apartment.  Hardly breathing, making no sudden movements, she checks her doors.  The kitchen ... empty.  The bedroom ... empty.  The bathroom ... empty. Joey stands back in the center of her main room, facing out to her big picture window.  Slowly, she lets out a big breath and then draws an equally slow one in.

He holds it out to show Joey ... and then suddenly closes his powerful hand on it, apparently crushing it.
