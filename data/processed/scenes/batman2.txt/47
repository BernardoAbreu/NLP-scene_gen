<A>__{the lieutenant unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's bag. the lead boat thug gestures to a stack of shipping crates which rest atop a large net spread out across the deck.}
<C>__{boat thug i}
<D>__{you pick.}
<A>__{the chief goon selects a crate at random. two boat thugs tip it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a false bottom revealing a dozen packets of white powder. pov shot high angle that moment we're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a ramshackle boathouse at water's edge. down on the deck of the steamboat, the lieutenant goes to work testing the merchandise.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{it's pure.}
<A>__{reverse angle that moment a black silhouette is peering down from the boathouse roof. the mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only details that register are a pair of ominously familiar pointy}
<B>__{ears...}
<C>__{chief goon }
<D>__{let's do it.}
<A>__{he gestures to his boys on the dock. a crane and winch assembly rotates into place over the deck and the boat thugs gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to the big hook.}
<C>__{boat thug i}
<D>__{hold it. let's see the money.}
<A>__{down on the wharf, a dock goon kneels beside a metal suitcase and opens it. lots of long green inside. the boat thug signals thumbs up, and the crates rise into the air as the goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank. low angle on gangplank that moment the goon with the suitcase marches up. beyond him, in the distance, a lithe black shadow vaults off the boathouse roof and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the}
<B>__{crane.}
<A>__{another angle that moment the moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck and crane swings over the pier. angle on crane that moment razor sharp, chrome steel talons slash suddenly through the air. on dock low angle that moment the netting gives way, and two dozen shipping crates rain down onto the pier, crushing two dock goons underneath. the crates explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and random art objects as the other dock goons scatter in panic. on steamboat that moment nobody knows quite what's going on. panicking, the goon with the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the gangplank. boat thug i sees him and squeezes off a quick shot. winged, the goon topples off the gangplank and hits the drink, suitcase and all. pandemonium. all at once, everyone's opening fire. thinking he's been double crossed, boat thug i turns on the chief goon and shoots him twice at point blank range.}
<C>__{boat thug i}
<D>__{you son of a bitch!}
<P>__{(to another boat thug)}
<D>__{go after it. get the money. go!!}
<A>__{he raises his gun, and the second boat thug dutifully obeys diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire. everyone's ducking for cover. boat thug i barks orders at the pilothouse:}
<C>__{boat thug i}
<D>__{soltar las amarras! cast off!!}
<C>__{another boat thug}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{boat thug i whirls, just in time to see a shadowy figure landing cat like on the deck mere yards away. clad in inky black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is concealed by what appears to be a bondage mask. studded, with openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous touch: a pair of pointed cat ears. she bares her teeth and hisses. it's a woman. boat thug i is momentarily mesmerized. in the time it takes him to lift his gun, she's produced a cat o' nine tails. she snaps it at him: reels him in; and with one lethal stroke, rakes her steel talons across his face and throat. he slumps to the deck, lifeless. the other boat thug rushes her; she catches him under the jaw with a sudden upthrust, lifts him into the air, and sends him toppling into the water. the gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the pier. she hoists an abandoned assault rifle, scatters the dock goons with a round of automatic fire, and vaults off the boat landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier. most of the dock goons have taken flight, but a few unlucky specimens remain behind. she somersaults forward; takes one goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off the dock with a twirling high kick to the jaw; sends two more reeling with swift talon slashes. the whole frenzied mop up action takes just under ten seconds. alone at last, she stands back to survey the scene. counting the stiff's on the boat which is now receding in the harbor there must be well over a dozen dead. the snow is speckled with red. a half dozen bodies lie sprawled in their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face down and softly moaning. retracting her steel claws, the masked woman crouches amid the wreckage of the smashed shipping crates. bindles of white powder millions of dollars' worth are scattered all about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested. instead, she's checking the manifest numbers stamped on the sides of the crates. she finds crate #18396 bb and rummages among its contents until she comes up with a carefully wrapped parcel. she opens it carefully and holds it up for inspection. the statuette of a raven carved from solid onyx glistens in the moonlight. the woman pauses long enough to slip a small card in the moaning punk's back pocket. then, cradling the raven under one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet. a lantern approaches. it's an old salt some kind of hapless night watchman and his face goes bone white at the sight of the carnage on the docks. he kneels beside the moaning punk, turns the body over, and gasps because the punk's face has been clawed to shreds.}
