<A>__{a car jolts to a stop. the camera pans up over the sagging suspension, the government plates, the hood ornament revealing half of excom inside. kenny stands nearby waiting for them. the doors open, and out they pile like a bunch of clowns: bobby, mcnamara, rusk, ball, martin, dioptric, sorensen, stevenson, and nitze. they're sitting in each others' laps, banging their heads on the roof, joking, but tense.}
