<A>__{andrews unrolls a big drawing of the ship across the chartroom table. it is a side elevation, showing all the watertight bulkheads. his hands are shaking. murdoch and ismay hover behind andrews and the captain.}
<C>__{ismay}
<A>__{when can we get underway, do you think? smith glares at him and turns his attention to andrews' drawing. the builder points to it for emphasis as he talks.}
<C>__{andrews}
<A>__{water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.}
<C>__{smith}
<A>__{that's right.}
<C>__{andrews}
<A>__{five compartments. she can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. but not five. not five. as she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at e deck... from one to the nexterior.. back and back. there's no stopping it.}

<A>__{the pumps }
<C>__{andrews}
<A>__{the pumps buy you time... but minutes only. from this moment, no matter what we do, titanic will founder.}
<C>__{ismay}
<A>__{but this ship can't sink!}
<C>__{andrews}
<A>__{she is made of iron, sir. i assure you, she can. and she will. it is a mathematical certainty. smith looks like he has been gutpunched.}
<C>__{smith}
<A>__{how much time?}
<C>__{andrews}
<A>__{an hour, two at most. ismay reels as his dream turns into his worst nightmare.}
<C>__{smith}
<A>__{and how many aboard, mr. murdoch?}
<C>__{murdoch}
<A>__{two thousand two hundred souls aboard, sir. a long beat. smith turns to his employer.}
<C>__{smith}
<A>__{i believe you may get your headlines, mr. ismay.}
