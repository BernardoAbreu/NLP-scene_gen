<D>__{we got a seminole, or seminoles, in the swamp. i'm on janes scenic drive just east of logging road twelve. i repeat, indians in the swamp.}
<A>__{tony waits for a response. nothing.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{indians in the swamp.}
<A>__{nothing still. tony clears his throat into the radio.}
<C>__{radio voice}
<D>__{i don't know what you want me to say.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{barry, indians do not go on swamp walks. if there are indians in the swamp, they are in there for a reason.}
<A>__{no response. tony glowers, gets out of the truck, watches the vehicles through binoculars. nothing. he straightens his cap. mosquitoes land on his neck, his nose, his lips.}
