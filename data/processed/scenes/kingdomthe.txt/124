<A>__{a five block radius has been sealed off by police vehicles. fleury and his team are at the outer perimeter, crouched behind barricades at the entrance of a cul de sac. they're not allowed anywhere near the line of fire. they sport bullet proof vests and helmets: look like reporters in a war zone. police turn away cars, neighbors. snipers stand posted on near by rooftops. helicopters audible overhead. street deserted.}

<A>__{the two swat teamers at the front of the running boards open up with their mp 5s one handed: the front of the house puffs, bursts, disintegrates. suburbans rip to a stop. swat off, move fast. three toss flash grenades into and around the house. massive flash bangs. six through the front door. six sprinting around back. loud ak 47 bursts from inside now...screams. then an rpg fired inside: the rushing sound and yellow white flash past two windows. a section of the far left wall of the house detonates from the inside out. more mechanical, silenced thwacks from the swat mp 5s. silence. then voices from al ghazi's walkie talkie. ambulances round the corner, fly toward the house:}
