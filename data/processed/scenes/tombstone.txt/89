<L>__{ext camp night}
<A>__{they're camped by a running stream. wyatt stares into the fire. doc crouches opposite him, shaking his head:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i'm a man without fear, wyatt. i literally don't care if i live or die. but even i can't fight human instinct. somebody suddenly starts shooting at me, i duck. but you... what on earth were you thinking about?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i don't know. it all happened so fast. if i'd had a chance to think about it i guess i probably would've been scared but... swear to god, doc, i just don't know.}
<A>__{at the other end of camp, vermillion and johnson sit together. after a beat:}
<C>__{vermillion}
<D>__{hey creek, you ever see anything like that before?}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{never even heard of anything like it.}
<A>__{vermillion nods. both look shaken to the very core of their beings. finally:}
<C>__{vermillion}
<D>__{i just thought of somethin' i never thought about before.}
<P>__{(pauses, looks at him)}
<D>__{i don't want to go to hell.}
