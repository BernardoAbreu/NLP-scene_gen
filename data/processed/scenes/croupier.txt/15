<A>__{now at a roulette table, reynolds has prepared the bets for fifteen punters. it's a set up to test jack's style and concentration. reynolds gives jack the white ball.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you use two alternating, don't you?}
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{we do.}
<P>__{(hands him a second ball)}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{where's the magnet?}
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{they've been tested.}
<A>__{jack spins the wheel, throws the ball against the turn.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no more bets.}
<A>__{as the ball begins to bounce, but before it stops, reynolds turns to a cleaning lady who's emptying some ashtrays nearby.}
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{could you stop that for a minute?}
<A>__{the woman looks up, surprised. jack watches, then catches sight of reynolds surreptitiously moving a chip onto the third line.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir, i've called no more bets.}
<A>__{jack reaches across, takes the chip and puts it on the wood grounding the wheel. reynolds nods approvingly. the ball stops.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{23 red. odd.}
<A>__{he now rakes away the losers' chips and pays out the smallest first, before getting to the major pay out on 23. it's all very efficient and speedy. reynolds is increasingly impressed.}
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{haven't you forgotten something?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{wipe your hands.}
<A>__{jack takes out a handkerchief.}
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{not with your own cloth. besides, your pockets will be stitched.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what happens if i want to sneeze?}
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{you won't. not without permission.}
<A>__{jack laughs. reynolds smiles. they like each other.}
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{fine. now let's move on.}
