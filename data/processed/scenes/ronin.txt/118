<A>__{gregor and seamus are leaving the post office. by now, seamus has taken the package away from gregor. unseen by these two men vincent is approaching from the side, on an intercept course, his hand inside a bag which he carries with him. now deirdre turns and shoots sam a look. he's still watching her keenly, and we can see that she's aching to reach for her piece, but she can't because sam is still on her like a hawk.}

<A>__{vincent is closing on gregor and seamus, another ten seconds and he'll have them. now deirdre looks back at sam, then back at the situation developing in front of her, and then suddenly she slams the car into gear and drives off, tires squealing while sam pulls his piece, sighting down the barrel and he can't do it, can't shoot deirdre. now the sound of the car alerts seamus, who turns in time to see vincent, who is raising the bag wrapped around his hand as the car flies directly at vincent, who if forced to jump out of the way even as he pulls the trigger of the gun hidden within the bag. the end of the bag explodes in a burst of fire, but the shots are off the mark missing seamus and gregor as vincent rolls out of the way, just in time, while deirdre brakes the car to a screaming halt, as seamus pushes gregor in ahead of him and then gets in. seconds later, the car pulls out, even as sam drives up in the peugeot to vincent, who picks himself up off the ground and leaps into the car. the last thing we hear is the sound of sam's voice as the peugeot drives off.}
