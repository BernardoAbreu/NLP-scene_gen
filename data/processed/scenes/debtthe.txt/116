<L>__{exterior stairwell courtyard continuous}
<A>__{vogel clears the stairs and bursts into the courtyard. there is a lurid flash of fireworks from nearby and for a moment we see vogel lit, as he passes the point where earlier we saw him drop to the ground. he reaches the gate and goes through, his shadow disappearing on the pavement. he's gone.}
<L>__{interior berlin safehouse living room. night}
<A>__{rachel holds a blood soaked tea towel to her cheek, trying to staunch the flow. david sits, staring ahead, in shock. stephan bursts in, out of breath.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{nothing. not a trace. nothing at all.}
<A>__{he hurries to the drawers and takes out the gun, puts it into his waistband.}
<C>__{stephan }
<D>__{he might go to the house, might try and get a message to the wife...}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{he's not going back to the house. he's gone. fifteen years, it took them to find him. and he's gone. and no one's going to find him again.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{so we what? we...are you going to make the phone call? are you going to tell them how he got a fucking piece of broken bowl? wonderful. but don't try and take me down with you. i've done nothing wrong. remember that!}
<A>__{stephan kicks at the chair, at the drawers.}
<C>__{stephan }
<P>__{(muttering tensely)}
<D>__{this can't happen! this is never going to go away.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i take responsibility. it was my shift.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{this happened because of me. i let him go. and no one's ever going to find him again.}
<A>__{he closes his eyes, struggling with the enormity of his guilt. stephan drops the gun onto the table, sits down. outside we hear more fireworks. suddenly...}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{no one's ever going to find him again.}
<A>__{something in his voice causes rachel to look up at him.}
<C>__{stephan }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what if he didn't escape?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{only four people know what happened in this room. us, and him. and he's not talking. no one will ever hear from him again.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(realizing what he means)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{nobody needs to know what happened here.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{he escaped.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{that's the truth. but that doesn't have to be the truth we take home. the truth can be anything we want it to be. the truth is vogel tried to escape, you struggled with him and got hurt. the truth is, seconds before he got away, rachel got the gun and shot him. the truth is we got rid of him.... got rid of the body... got rid of every trace of the surgeon of birkenau.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{we can't lie about this!}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{no, you know what? we have to. we have to! this is...this isn't about us. this is about israel. this is a national humiliation! we can't be seen to fail. and in the end, vogel rots away his life in some jungle, looking over his shoulder, waiting for the bullet...? who's to say...?}
<A>__{he looks at them both, trying to convince them, trying to convince himself.}
<C>__{stephan }
<D>__{maybe that's a worse fate. maybe that's...the important thing is justice... justice is seen to be done!}
<A>__{rachel turns to david, waiting, expecting him to say something. but david looks like he's been barely listening, lost in his own thoughts. he notices rachel staring at him.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{he's gone. what does it matter?(beat) he's gone.}
<A>__{stephan seizes on this, sensing he's close to convincing them.}
<C>__{stephan}
<P>__{(seizing )}
<D>__{he's right. it makes no difference. no difference. all we have to agree is that we never talk about this. no matter what happens, we never tell anyone. the truth stays in this room. between us. agreed?}
<A>__{rachel looks at david again, wanting some kind of sign.}
<C>__{stephan }
<P>__{(to rachel)}
<D>__{agreed? say it. (silence) i need to hear you say it!}
<A>__{she's still staring at david. he's still avoiding her gaze.}
<C>__{stephan }
<P>__{(to rachel)}
<D>__{say it. say...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{agreed.}
<A>__{silence. rachel closes her eyes. instead of relief she feels a kind of immense disappointment.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{david...?}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{rachel? say it. it's an oath. say it.}
<A>__{we close on rachel. the moment that will change her life forever. from outside comes the sound of some revellers on the street cheering, more fireworks. we hear some people chanting a countdown to the new year...}
<C>__{revellers }
<P>__{(from outside)}
<D>__{...vier, drei, zwei, ein!}
<A>__{but just before the expected barrage of fireworks we...}
