<L>__{interior carol's apartment day}
<A>__{seven women sit around the cramped living room of this small, east village apartment. at least one woman is nursing a child that looks entirely too old to still be nursing. this is the single mothers by choice support group. carol,}
<L>__{40's, short hair, tank top and no bra, is the leader.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{everyone, please say hello to zoe.}
<C>__{everyone}
<D>__{hi, zoe.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{welcome to single mother's by choice. as the name suggests, we are all single mothers by choice. some of us have adopted, some conceived with a donor, every story is different, but with the same common denominator. we wanted to have a child, and we didn't need a partner to make it happen.}
<A>__{the women smile and nod. they are a proud, no nonsense, somewhat masculine bunch. lori, pregnant with a buzz cut, turns to zoe.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{are you a doer or a tryer?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{are you already a single mother or are you trying to become one?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{oh, i guess i'm trying. i was just inseminated a few days ago.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{inseminated...makes me feel like a cow or something.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{well, when we don't have partners with penises, we do what we've got to do, right?}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{so, tell us a little bit about yourself.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{okay. let's see...um, i own a pet store on hudson street. dogs, cats, rabbits...no birds, they creep me out. before that, i worked for google, which i completely hated. one day, i decided life was too short, and, against my accountant's advice, i quit google, cashed out and bought the pet store. now i'm really happy on the work front, but i still haven't found, you know, the one.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{ah, yes. the elusive "one."}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i always imagined i'd be married with kids by now, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen that way. so, time for plan b.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{society tells us we're supposed to find that special person to make us happy and complete. but guess what...you have to create your own happiness. you don't need someone to complete you, some...man. you already are complete.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{amen, sister.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{if you want to have a baby, we here at single mothers by choice can be your partners. we will be your emotional rocks.}
<A>__{zoe looks around at her new "partners." there's sara, the one nursing the toddler. and tabitha, a tall women with an even taller afro and a nose ring. bridget, a young girl covered in tatoos. and several more...}
<C>__{carol }
<D>__{from inception to college graduation and everything in between. we're here for each other.}
<A>__{sara smiles and nods at her nursing child.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{dakota was actually born right here in this very room. right where you're sitting, actually.}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{really? right here? imagine that.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{best day of my life.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{and how old is she now?}
<A>__{dakota looks up from the breast.}
<C>__{dakota}
<D>__{i'm three.}
