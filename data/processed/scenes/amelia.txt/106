<L>__{exterior oakland airport day}
<A>__{george wandering numbly on the airfield, as someone runs like crazy from the office, shouting...}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{no fire! no fire, false report! no one hurt!}
<A>__{george alone on the tarmac. stops in his tracks. now he can cry.}
<L>__{exterior garden, los angeles home almost sunrise}
<A>__{two figures in a garden, walking in light so spare they are silhouettes. her head is down. his hands are in his pockets. we close on them as she fingers a blossom, we now see she is miserable, fighting absolute despair.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{three weeks, she'll be good as new. it's a remarkable crew. the best that...}
<A>__{he stops. realizing where he was going. she never looks up.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{...the best that money can buy. i just can't believe i've done this to us. all the money wasted that's never coming back.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you cut the engines. it would have cost a bundle more to replace a burned up plane. not to mention pilot.}
<A>__{she shakes her head. no.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i overreacted. the plane was too heavy, i should have used the rudder pedal instead of the throttle.}
<A>__{tears stand in her eyes. she is so ashamed and remorseful. he lets it stay silent as they walk. then...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's only money, we'll figure it out. we always do.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i will make it back and more, i promise. the book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another three years.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{maybe. or...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{no, it will. our prices, our sales, are going to double.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{this showed them how dangerous it all is, they were taking it for granted...}
<P>__{(sniffles)}
<D>__{they thought i was competent.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i meant. or maybe we can quit.}
<A>__{she looks over. not sure if...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{you mean after.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{or. even now.}
<A>__{a strong smile. he nods. we could.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{so my exit would be a stupid crash. and withdrawing from a world publicized attempt to finally do something no man had done before.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yeh. that. and it would be fine with me.}
<A>__{her eyes overwhelmed by his offer. her voice soft with...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{but that's because you're an idiot.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{lucky for you.}
<A>__{a held beat.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{and what if it’s not something i have to show the world?}
<A>__{hmmn?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{what if it’s something i have to show me.}
<A>__{he has no answer for that. takes her hand. they head toward the house.}
