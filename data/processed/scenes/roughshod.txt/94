<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{if you're figuring on asking me to take you, it's no use.}
<A>__{mary crosses to stand above him.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{a time like this people ought to be alone. having us around is going to make it sort of hard on 'em.}
<A>__{mary sighs, sits beside him. from the pocket of her robe she takes tobacco, rolls a cigarette and lights it. she passes the tobacco to clay. he rolls one.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(on the defensive)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i suppose it is.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{and it's not only because the trip's a tough one }
<A>__{mary strikes a match and holds the flame to his cigarette.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you don't have to explain. did i tell you how grateful i am for what you've done?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i couldn't leave you sitting by the road.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you could have treated us like they did in aspen. no. you wouldn't do a thing like that it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.}
<A>__{mary rises to move to the edge of the porch.}
<B>__{med. close}
<A>__{mary in f.g.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{no man who brings up a kid like you've brought up steve could ever be cruel to people.}
<A>__{turning, she leans against the post that supports the porch.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i hope you get everything you want out of life }
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(wary)}
<D>__{thanks.}

<D>__{the who?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you should know. she's in your dream.}
<A>__{clay puts his cup down, looks up. she is very lovely standing in the moonlight, her body arched back, the robe open a little.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{ever since you've looked after steve you've had the dream a ranch on the river good grass, good water, barn corral and house that part you've shared with steve. the girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking.}
<P>__{(she pauses)}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(enigmatic)}
<D>__{go on. tell me more about her.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{she wears this gingham dress cooks popovers makes jam in season makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.}

<D>__{but the rest is right.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{will she be dark or fair?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{blonde as a new mop. and beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.}
<A>__{straightening, she crosses the porch to pause momentarily close to clay.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i hope you find her because, like i said, you've earned your dream. goodnight.}
<A>__{she enters the house. clay looks after her, smiling faintly. he knows she is up to something but not what.}
