<A>__{rush and mega battle off three x takks the way is clear. rush leaps, crashes planes of silicon. stows his disk, pulls out the hologon. spots the control cell's key receptacle shapes match. rush moves to insert the hologon. a disk strikes his arm hologon flies wild.}

<D>__{where did you get that?! no one knows this code but me!}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{your software has the biggest flaw there is, plexor. you can't see you own mistakes.}
<A>__{plexor snatches his death disk, corners rush for the kill. mega's disk crashes silicon, comes at plexor but his defense field repels it. he slams it aside and it's raked away by downward flowing energy rings. rush dives at plexor. he's like a statue. but this time rush holds him and infuses tron energy, breaking down plexor's defense field, eating into his body circuits. it's fractal zapping fireworks evenly matched foes battling face to face.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{do it mega!}
<A>__{mega scoops hologon off floor, makes for control cell plexor's hand shoots out, grabs her, stops her like iron. plexor exerts his power, holds rush and mega by the throats with his two hands, backing them toward a surface ripping with hot energy rings. rush and mega struggle, an inch from death zaaaaaa plexor stops, annoyed. turns and sees: krod, fighters and i beem have arrived, firing blasters at plexor's spinal nexus. it hardly makes a dent, but it creates a fleeting opportunity for rush rush ducks forward, shoots his disk off his back, smacking plexor in the throat. mega falls clear rush hurls plexor against energy rings energy rakes down his body, but he fights the effects an does not melt down. he step away, shakes off the damage, retrieves his disk into a hand. mega snags the hologon }

<D>__{rush!}
<A>__{she tosses it to rush, who's already airborne rush catches hologon, sails to the control unit jams hologon into its receptacle. plexor cocks his death disk, eyes flash electro psychosis hologon reacts with central cell shockwaves radiate energy rings go dim, then dark silicon shatters to ash x takks power down. x net armor de rezzes, leaving innocent civilian programs. they shake off the mind control and rise unshackled. and plexor, like all things x net, chatters and glitches. his code erodes, his bits darken, the fiber of his being erodes from inside.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{now who's obsolete?}
<A>__{rush executes a final leap, extending his feet for the final blow, straight at plexor crash shattering him to bits. rush finally breathes. sees i beem, krod, quantz, boole, code monkeys.}
