<L>__{exterior sharecropper shack early morning}
<A>__{scratch and lonnie are set to pretend to play music again. lonnie spreads his fingers over the keys he's drawn on the board and begins to play! fast, rhythmic boogie piano instead of a diddley bow, scratch is pretending to tune the two strings on a `guitar' made of a plank of wood and baling wire. he carefully takes a length of clothesline rope leading from the guitar, tacks the end of it to the wall of the shack, plugging himself in. he looks to lonnie, who nods, and then he begins to play in time with lonnie. we crane up and away from them, the music spilling out over the field it sounds a whole lot like rock and roll.}
