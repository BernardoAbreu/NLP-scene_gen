<L>__{interior armenian apostolic church day}
<A>__{the church is packed. close on the rings as the priest holds them aloft. if those rings could talk... jack shoots a quick look at miles, who looks right back. the priest continues his blessing.}
<L>__{exterior armenian church day}
<A>__{at the top of the stairs the wedding families greet the exiting guests in a receiving line. smiling and exuberant, jack seems utterly at home as the new groom. at the bottom of the steps miles watches the scene, not without melancholy. then }
<C>__{victoria }
<D>__{hey, miles.}
<A>__{miles turns and looks up to see victoria, standing one step above him. just behind her is her new husband. he exudes the quiet confidence of a successful businessman who played college football, takes expensive skiing and sailing vacations, and hasn't read a novel since high school.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hi, vicki.}
<P>__{(taking her in)}
<D>__{you look beautiful.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{thanks. um, this is ken cortland, my husband.}
<A>__{from his spot hovering over miles, ken leans down and offers his hand.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{how are you?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hi. how you doing? you're a lucky guy.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(to victoria)}
<D>__{i will wait for you at the car.}
<P>__{(to miles)}
<D>__{nice to meet you, miles.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{ken.}
<A>__{exit ken.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{that was big of him.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{yeah, he's good that way. very considerate.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{that's great.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{so how're you doing?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{since the last time we spoke? i don't know. could be better. could be worse.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{so what's happening with your book?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{universally rejected. strike three.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{oh, miles. that's awful. what are you going to do?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{back to the drawing board, i guess. or not. so... you're married. congratulations. you look happy.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{seems like everyone's getting married. a year ago it was all divorces. now it's all weddings. cyclical, i guess.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{i guess.}
<A>__{just then a black lincoln navigator pulls up alongside the curb. the passenger side window is halfway down, and the sounds of adult contemporary jazz waft out. victoria gives ken a little wave.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(shifting gears)}
<D>__{well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? toast all the newlyweds.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{not me. i'm not drinking.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you quit drinking?}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{i'm pregnant.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(hit in the solar plexus)}
<D>__{oh. huh. well...}
<P>__{(rallying)}
<D>__{congratulations again, vicki. that's wonderful news.}
<C>__{victoria}
<P>__{(going to the car)}
<D>__{see you over there, miles.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{as she gets in the car and cruises away, miles glances back at }
<B>__{the receiving line}
<A>__{ where mike erganian is introducing jack to some dear old friends. mike throws a loving arm around his new son in law, and jack is drawn into mike's bosom.}
