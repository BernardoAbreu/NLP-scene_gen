<L>__{interior passages to river night}
<A>__{aramis, athos and porthos carrying louis descend the secret passages to the foundations of the palace, into a drainage channel leading to the river. they have stashed a boat there; they plop louis into it and climb in themselves. they row toward the archway that is the exit to the river; the moonlit waters of the seine glow outside, like a beacon of safe escape. but the steel grate of the archway slams down just before they reach it, and blades point at them from every angle of the darkness. a shielded lantern rises and its wick is turned up, revealing d'artagnan he stands with a small contingent of young musketeers. his eyes are intense, his face in agony.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{my friends.}
<A>__{the only one they can see it d'artagnan. they all look at each other, in the small circle of light from the lantern.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{only we four, the most trusted musketeers, knew about the passages, meant to keep the king safe... your majesty...}
<A>__{phillippe steps out of the darkness; his eyes are full of shame and failure as he looks at athos, but still he holds on, trying to maintain the charade that he is louis.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{yes...? why do you bring me here, d'artagnan?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{the king! look! it's the king!}
<A>__{he means phillippe.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{then who is that lying beside you?}
<A>__{porthos turns and looks at louis then reacts as if he's totally surprised at the presence of this man tied up and gagged beside him.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{wh ? where did he come from?}
<A>__{athos grabs d'artagnan's arm.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{if you ever loved me if you ever loved honor, or anything else then stand now, and let it happen.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i cannot, athos. dearly as i love you, i cannot.}
<A>__{d'artagnan takes his dagger and cuts the ropes that bind louis' hands, and the gag that has kept him from talking. aramis suddenly backhands louis, knocking him flat on his back in the boat, and pointing to him louis.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{this man is an impostor. we caught him trying to impersonate the king, and were just getting rid of him.}
<A>__{louis struggles upright.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{d'artagnan, arrest them all!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{shut up, knave!}
<A>__{aramis slaps louis again, and pleads with his eyes that d'artagnan accept their ruse. d'artagnan is dying inside.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{before i came here, i insisted the king come with me. the real louis would never have let me insist.}
<A>__{seeing they are about to be arrested, the old musketeers in the boat spring into action against their younger counterparts. athos swats one swordsman with an oar; porthos seizes the guard who has grabbed a hold of the boat and flings the man back into two of his comrades; aramis grabs louis by the hair and puts his dagger to his throat.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{pull them back, d'artagnan.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{you can't do it.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{pull them back!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{everyone back.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{phillippe, get into the boat. into the boat! now!}
<A>__{phillippe obeys.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{open the gate.}
<A>__{d'artagnan nods to his men, and they open the iron gate leading out to the river. the boat makes for the opening. just as it is about to reach it, louis forces aramis' hand.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you will not shed royal blood!}
<A>__{he kicks at the boat and struggles to stand, making the boat tip wildly and throwing everyone in it all around. aramis draws the dagger away from louis' throat to keep from killing him, and d'artagnan makes a grab at louis and drags him onto the stone floor of the channel. the boat is almost through the opening and louis snatches at his brother, phillippe. the current outside the gate is rushing by, and the boat is already caught in the current; it's pulling away and the musketeers can't stop it. athos seizes phillippe's legs and tries to hold him, but the pressure of the current is great, and now not only louis but some of the young musketeers are helping hold phillippe. phillippe's legs slip out of athos' grasp, and the boat flashes downriver... aramis, porthos and athos have escaped... but phillippe is captured, looking into the hate filled eyes of his twin brother louis.}
