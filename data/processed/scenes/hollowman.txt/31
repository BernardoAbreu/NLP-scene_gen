<A>__{as linda, matt and sebastian head to their cars.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yo. reality check! what the hell was that about?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{keep your voice down.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{the protocol works. why'd you tell them it didn't?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i wasn't ready for them to know.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{but they're the oversight committee. they're supposed to know.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i'm sure he had a reason.}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{you did have a reason, didn't you, sebastian?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i had more than a reason. i had a goddamn epiphany.}
<A>__{they reach his porsche.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{what do you think they'd do if they know we could send a subject into phase shift and pull it back out again? how many seconds would it take for them to take over the whole project, bringing in their soldiers to test the formula on. we'd have lost control of it by the end of the week.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{it's their money, sebastian. it's going to happen eventually.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i know. but not yet. there's too much for us to learn. i don't want my hands tied by their political agenda when we go to phase three.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{well, then... mind telling us how you're gonna get a human test subject for phase three without the committee finding out?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{that's easy. i've decided to test the procedure ...}
