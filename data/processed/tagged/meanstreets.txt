<A>__{the twa terminal at kennedy. tony's car pulls up to the curb, charlie gets out, waves away help from an idle porter, and pulls his suitcases out of the back seat. tony leans across the seat toward him.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{listen, try a place with some sun. swimming pools. palm trees. girls in little french bathing suits.}
<C>__{charlie}

<C>__{tony}
<D>__{see you.}
<A>__{charlie nods and watches the car pull away. then he picks up his bag from the sidewalk and walks into the terminal.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior terminal day}
<A>__{the place is huge and there is a lot of bustle and excitement. charlie is noticeable because he is the only member of the crowd who walks slowly, without any apparent mission or destination. he makes his way toward the large flight board that looms over the whole room. loudspeakers announce planes to and from every part of the world. on the flight board, the origins and destinations of the days flight spin and change every moment. he passes the insurance machines and almost stops more upset than before. a businessman calmly pays for insurance. (muzak is heard) charlie continues on past a novelty shop where some plastic crosses and st. christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy dogs and flight bags. he looks at the cross.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't know what to say to you...}
<A>__{the ticket desk is under the flight board. charlie eventually works his way over to the desk, drops his bag on the floor and stands staring at the board. he sees the names of dozens of cities flashing before him. as he watches, a pretty ticket clerk speaks to him from behind the desk.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{may i help you?}
<A>__{charlie stares at the flight board in dismay and indecision. he apparently does not hear her.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{sir, may i help you?}
<A>__{charlie hears her this time. he reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out the ticket which he passes across to her. the clerk starts to open it to check the destination.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(questioning, challenging)}
<D>__{where can i go?}
<A>__{the question is unusual. the clerk looks up. charlie stare back at her with a quality that is almost defiance.}
