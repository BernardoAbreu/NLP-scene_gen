<A>__{babe brother is sitting with sunny by the screen door blowing giant bubbles. the bubbles drift past linda, who is sitting at the table with real estate papers all over the table. she is talking on the phone with a client and signals them to stop disturbing her. babe brother sends more bubbles floating by, causing her to shake the water off her papers while she talks to a first time buyer.}

<D>__{will you still get the money from your father?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.}
<C>__{babe brother}
<D>__{pops put big daddy's farm in rhonda's and sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{we could borrow on that land and put the money to work.}
<C>__{babe brother}
<D>__{i preached to mom and dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. but if there is a way...}
<A>__{babe brother is lost in his thoughts. he stares down at his hands resting on his knees. he picks up the telephone.}
