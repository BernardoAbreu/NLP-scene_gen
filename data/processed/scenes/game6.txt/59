<A>__{michael is eating his omelette at a small enamel topped table in the kitchen. nicky stands by the boxlike refrigerator, drinking a beer. this is the kitchen that is the centerpiece of the theatre set. the new play is nicky's young life.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{it's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. how did we do it? five people in these little rooms.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{get yourself something to eat.}
<A>__{nicky takes some eggs out of the refrigerator.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{we must have been heroic.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{five's not so many. there were families with seven kids. a grandmother. a dimwit uncle.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{lillian says it once a week. `why doesn't he come live with us?'}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you know the answer to that.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i do know the answer to that. why don't we watch the ball game later? we'll go to mannion's.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{they're only gonna lose.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{of course they're gonna lose. we'll watch them lose. what good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the red sox are your problem. i never understood about you and the red sox. everybody rooted for the yankees.}
<A>__{nicky is scrambling the eggs.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{remember 1949? last two games of the season. against the yankees. the sox lost on saturday. then they lost on sunday. first i cried for twenty four hours. then i had fist fights the rest of the week.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it's one thing for kids. you get older, you nhave other things.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{it's all connected, pop. it's one life. baseball is memory. how do fathers and sons show their love? they go to a ball game together. thirty five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{but the son is suppose to stop crying.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i could have grown up happy. a yankee fan. a divorce lawyer.}
<A>__{nicky sees his father's glasses on a shelf above the stove. he puts them on the table.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you'll need these. tonight. for the play.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{don't make me sit through one of your plays.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{hey, pop. i know you don't like the commotion of opening night. but i especially want you to see this play. it's new territory for me. and for you too. i have to know what you think.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{since when did that matter?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{let's not start that again.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{my back is killing me.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{where's your elastic brace?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i can't find it.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i lost it. i lose everything.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i will go get you another one. you have to wear it.}
<A>__{nicky takes a roll off the counter, makes a sandwich for his scrambled eggs, takes a bite and heads for the door.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{be right back. take a good look at me.}
<A>__{michael puts on his glasses.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{so i know who i'm letting in.}
