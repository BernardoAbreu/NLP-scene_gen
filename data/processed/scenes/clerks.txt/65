<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{int: convenience store. day}
<A>__{dante is tugging at a can of pringles potato chips. the can is stuck on a man's hand.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{you hold the counter and i will pull.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{usually i just turn the can upside down.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(pulling)}
<D>__{maybe we should soap your hand or something.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(straining)}
<D>__{they oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i think it's coming now...}
<A>__{the can pops off and dante staggers back a few steps. the man rubs his hand.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{thanks. i thought i was gonna have to go to the hospital.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i will throw this out. precautionary measure.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{it stings a little.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{a word of advice: sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.}
<A>__{dante steps behind the counter.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{the man exits as randal enters. dante throws the canister away.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{do you know that article is accurate? caitlin's really getting married!}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you know what i just watched?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{me pulling a can off some moron's fist.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{return of the jedi.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{didn't you hear me? caitlin really is getting married.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{which did you like better: jedi or the empire strikes back.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{empire.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{blasphemy.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{empire had the better ending: luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out vader's his father; han gets frozen and taken away by boba fett. it ends on such a down note. and that's life a series of down endings. all jedi had was a bunch of muppets.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{there was something else going on in jedi. i never noticed it until today.}
<A>__{randal follows dante as he cleans up around the store.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{all right, vader's boss...}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{the emperor.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{right, the emperor. now the emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{how do you mean?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the force. he's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{now, he's in charge of the empire. the imperial government is under his control. and the entire galaxy is under imperial rule.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? if the head of the empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{it would stand to reason, yes.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{hence, the empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{more or less.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{the only problem is that at no point in the series did i ever hear leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i think they were catholics.}
<A>__{a blue collar man half enters the door.}
<D>__{blue collar man are you open?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{yeah. come in.}
<A>__{he goes to the coffee machine and makes a cup of joe.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you know what else i noticed in jedi?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{there's more?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{so they build another death star, right?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the rebels destroyed it.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{luke blew it up. give credit where it's due.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{and the second one was still being built when they blew it up.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{compliments of lando calrissian.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. i could never put my finger on it something just wasn't right.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{and you figured it out?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{well, the thing is, the first death star was manned by the imperial army storm troopers, dignitaries the only people onboard were imperials.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{basically.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{so when they blew it up, no prob. evil is punished.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{and the second time around...?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{the second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. they were still under construction.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{a construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the imperial army had to offer. i will bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{not just imperials, is what you're getting at.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{exactly. in order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main? all they know is killing and white uniforms.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{all right, so even if independent contractors are working on the death star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{all those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.}
<P>__{(notices dante's confusion)}
<D>__{all right, look you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two story in suburbia this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. all of a sudden these left wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three mile radius.}
<C>__{randal }
<D>__{you didn't ask for that. you have no personal politics. you're just trying to scrape out a living.}
<A>__{the blue collar man joins them.}
<D>__{blue collar man excuse me. i don't mean to interrupt, but what were you talking about?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{the ending of return of the jedi.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{my friend is trying to convince me that any contractors working on the uncompleted death star were innocent victims when the space station was destroyed by the rebels. blue collar man well, i'm a contractor myself. i'm a roofer...}
<P>__{(digs into pocket and produces business card)}
<D>__{dunn and reddy home improvements. and speaking as a roofer, i can say that a roofer's personal politics come heavily into play when choosing jobs.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{like when? blue collar man three months ago i was offered a job up in the hills. a beautiful house with tons of property. it was a simple reshingling job, but i was told that if it was finished within a day, my price would be doubled. then i realized whose house it was.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{whose house was it? blue collar man dominick bambino's.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{"babyface" bambino? the gangster? blue collar man the same. the money was right, but the risk was too big. i knew who he was, and based on that, i passed the job on to a friend of mine.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{based on personal politics. blue collar man right. and that week, the foresci family put a hit on babyface's house. my friend was shot and killed. he wasn't even finished shingling.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{no way! blue collar man}
<P>__{(paying for coffee)}
<D>__{i'm alive because i knew there were risks involved taking on that particular client. my friend wasn't so lucky.}
<P>__{(pauses to reflect)}
<D>__{you know, any contractor willing to work on that death star knew the risks. if they were killed, it was their own fault. a roofer listens to this...}
<P>__{(taps his heart)}
<D>__{not his wallet.}
<A>__{the blue collar man exits. dante and randal remain respectfully quiet for a moment. an angry woman opens the door and pokes her head in.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{is that video store open or not?}
