<L>__{interior lestat's bedroom night}
<A>__{lestat enters the bedroom. behind him, lestat's dressing room stretches off into the distance, rows of beautiful suits made from the finest wools and silks. the gradation of colors is spectacular. peering out at the near dawn light, a look of loneliness clouds his face. he crosses to the closet. opens a panel to reveal a safe. stares at it a moment. punches in the code. it swings open to reveal something wrapped carefully in black velvet. lestat unwraps it delicately. it's the ancient violin.}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{clever, clever librarian.}
<A>__{he quickly puts the violin back, closes the safe door. he shakes his head, tries to laugh it off. but a shadow remains on his face. lestat hears a gasp. turns. roger has just entered.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{i didn't see you come in.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{no, roger, you wouldn't have.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{so this house is fine i assume. to your liking?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{yes. for the moment.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{we'll be here for what? a week you think?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{well... i wouldn't unpack if i were you.}
<C>__{roger}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{right... the... girls you asked for. they're in the guest wing.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{ah. yes.}
<A>__{lestat gazes at the door, pensive.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{do you want me to take them home later?}
<A>__{lestat smiles at the clumsy attempt to protect the girls.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{no, thank you, roger. i will make sure they're taken care of.}
<A>__{roger nods, trying to hide his nervousness. lestat smiles...}
