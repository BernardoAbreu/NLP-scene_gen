<A>__{ding! the bell sounds again and round two begins. freddy and jason get to their feet and close in on each other. jason swings wide. freddy ducks under jason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for a close look. whump jason knocks the ref's head off, it goes flying up into the balcony. the crowd}
<B>__{cheers.}
<A>__{jason chases freddy around the ring, looking for an opening. freddy backpeddles, tripping over the ref's decapitated body as several hungry zombies drag him out of the ring, ripping his body apart and devouring it. up in their cage, meagan and lizzy grimace with disgust. jason reaches down and grabs freddy, hoisting him high above his head. then jason body slams freddy to the mat. the crowd cheers. jason starts jumping up and down on freddy's back. freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty can of spinach. in a grotesque parody of popeye he opens the can full of nasty worms and maggots and gulps it down. suddenly, freddy throws jason off his back and stands, huge muscles ballooning on his chest and arms. at the end of his right hand a heavy metal boxing glove. jason gets to his feet in time to see freddy cock the massive glove for a blow. ching! dozens of spikes spring out of the metal glove. freddy swings, knocking jason into the ropes. he bounces off and falls to the mat. the fans go nuts. as jason tries to get up, freddy swings his right arm around and around the metal boxing glove turning into a giant mallet. jason looks up just in time to see the mallet coming down. wham! freddy drives jason into the mat. the crowd goes wild. >from up in her cage, meagan starts to scream:}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{jason! get up! get up!}
<A>__{angle under the mat it's a dark, foreboding (under water) abyss. jason's legs kick, trying to get back up. something slithers up from out of the deep... wisps of empty blackness clutching at jason's boots. freddy pushes down on jason's mask, shoving him down. jason struggles but keeps slipping. this looks like the end of jason. freddy laughs.}
