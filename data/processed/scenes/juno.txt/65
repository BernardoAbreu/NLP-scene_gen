<A>__{vanessa and mark walk juno out. juno peers at some shopping bags from various kids stores.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{hey, what kind of swag did you score?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yeah. mall madness, huh?}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{oh it's just some stuff i picked up. for, you know, the baby. babies need a lot of things. i want everything to be just right.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. when my stepmom had my sister i remember she got about a million presents. they were all lame though, so i wasn't jealous.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{um, i think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{what do you mean? you mean...}
<P>__{(aghast)}
<D>__{do you think i'm going to flake out on you?}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{no, no, i don't think that, juno. it's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.}
<A>__{juno glances at mark and again at vanessa. vanessa looks embarrassed.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{cold feet.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{you should have gone to china. i heard they give away babies like free ipods. they shoot 'em out of those t shirt guns at sports events.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{right. well, juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. you might want to head home.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{naah. i'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. i gotta bounce anyway. it was nice seeing you guys again.}
<A>__{she waves and heads for the door.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(to juno)}
<D>__{hey, don't forget your bag.}
<A>__{vanessa looks pain stricken as mark helps juno with her bag.}
