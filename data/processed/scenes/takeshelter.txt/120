<C>__{psychiatrist}
<D>__{do you have any vacation time that you could use?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i don't have a job right now.}
<C>__{psychiatrist}
<D>__{well, i know that times are hard, but i think it's really important for you to separate yourself from that storm shelter.}
<C>__{psychiatrist }
<D>__{i think you need to break away from it for awhile. we can start you on some medication that i think will help, but that action alone would mean a lot.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{we usually go on a trip to myrtle beach every summer. we were gonns go this month.}
<C>__{psychiatrist}
<D>__{i think that would be okay if we start the medication now. it would give you all some time to prepare as a family, but i want to be clear, when curtis gets back he'll need to take more time than that.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{psychiatrist}
<D>__{i mean that he'll need hands on therapy at a real facility.}
<A>__{curtis looks up for the first time.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{you mean i have to leave my family.}
<C>__{psychiatrist}
<D>__{i think you need to seriously commit to some treatment.}
