<L>__{interior chop shop night}
<A>__{lex's pov his mom's volvo and a bmw are on adjacent hydraulic lifts inside a makeshift auto mechanic shop. two beefy jerks with blow torches stand next to the cars. one has a bandage on his head and seems to be in pain.}
<D>__{beefy jerk #1 so, i jump into the car, hot wire it in thirty seconds and start driving. then, suddenly i hear this scream. the disco queen was asleep in the back seat.}
<A>__{beefy jerk #2 laughs.}
<D>__{beefy jerk #1 you think it's funny? how would you like to have a stiletto heel smacking you in the temple when you're tryin' to work?}
<A>__{beefy jerk #2 laughs more. beefy jerk #1 checks the time.}
<D>__{beefy jerk #1 you about done splittin' a gut there? we gotta get these parts to toledo by nine.}
<A>__{then a familiar voice is heard coming from the back of the shop.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{then maybe you guys'll let me go, huh?}
<A>__{lex follows the voice and sees christine handcuffed to a radiator near the rear of the shop.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{come on, whadaya say? you scratch my back, i scratch yours. you let me go, and in return, i keep my big mouth shut about your little operation here. mum, know what i mean? beefy jerk #2 you're lucky you're still alive, wench. if you was a guy, we woulda thought nothin' of sawing your head off with a butter knife. beefy jerk #1 what are we gonna do with her anyway?}
<A>__{beefy jerk #2 bares what's left of his yellow, crusty teeth}
<D>__{beefy jerk #2 i dunno, but she sure looks fun.}
<A>__{beefy jerk #1 touches the bandage on his head.}
<D>__{beefy jerk #1 yeah, and payback's a bitch.}
<A>__{christine gags at the thought.}
<B>__{angle on wall crack}
<A>__{lex's eyeball bulges with terror.}
