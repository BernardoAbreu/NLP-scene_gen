<L>__{exterior sky night}
<A>__{like an intricate ballet, jacob, his body strapped to his chair, tumbles away from the dc 10 and 747 as they seem to merge and bend into some kind of mutant dc 47 wings and tails wrapping around each other as debris blooms out like a flower and together they explode a fiery ball lighting the nighttime clouds and jacob's shrieking face. and jacob falls and falls and falls, his hair sticking straight up from the blasting wind. that's when corpses start falling past him. the captain of the plane the stewardess, her body bent in half the greyhaired man, his head gone but his book still in his hand. more men, women, crew people and children. but these children aren't dead bodies. two little girls and one little boy, all dressed in white, plummet down next to jacob, head first, like high divers. and they're singing:}
<C>__{the children}
<D>__{one two, freddy's coming for you...}
<A>__{the children turn around in the sky so that they are travelling feet first. the little boy's pants puff up and the girls' skirts poof out and rip upward the wind taking away their clothes and their skin and their bodies and their hair...}
<C>__{the children }
<D>__{three four, better lock your door...}
<A>__{leaving three tiny skeletons taunting and laughing as jacob screams and covers his eyes.}
<C>__{the children }
<D>__{five six, grab your crucifix...}
<A>__{and the skeletons sprout wings leathery and veiny the wind catching them and sending them up and away as their voices echo in the sky.}
<C>__{the children }
<D>__{seven eight, gonna stay up late...}
<A>__{jacob takes his hands away from his face and starts to frantically pull on his seat belt. snap it flies off his back and miraculously turns into a parachute. rope swirls into the air the wind grabs the canvas and jacob's body slows with a violent jerk. but at least he's not falling anymore. jacob catches his breath as he starts gently floating through the sky. he smiles. this isn't so bad. this is actually kind of fun. not for long, though, because his new upward momentum carries him back up to: the winged children's skeletons. jacob's eyes bug out as he rises into them and they start to circle. they move closer and we can see something in their hands:}
<B>__{scissors}
<A>__{jacob twists his body, trying to steer his parachute away from the demons. one of the skeletons swoops up to his face and pokes its scissors inches away from jacob's eyes. it sings alone:}
<C>__{child}
<D>__{nine ten, never sleep again!}
<A>__{the skeleton cranks its arm back ready to plunge the scissor's blades into jacob's sockets. the arms swings toward him then suddenly diverts up past his head, heading for: the chute's strings the skeleton flaps its wings and poises its scissors at one of the ropes. the other two skeletons join it over jacob's head. the three of them look down at jacob, their boney jaws in a perpetual smile.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{the skeletons nod "yes". snip snip snip they cut away at jacob's parachute as he swings underneath them, trying to pull away snip snip. the parachute flutters away the skeletons cackle and jacob plummets.}
<B>__{on jacob}
<A>__{we stay with him as he screams and shrieks and yells and the clouds part and the ground rises quickly up to meet him. the ground becomes a town, the town becomes a block, the block becomes a house, the house becomes a roof, and...}
