<L>__{interior shaft}
<A>__{susan hauls herself up the framework, handhold by handhold. peter is right below her. she can see his arms are starting to tremble dangerously with the effort.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{we're gonna make it!}
<A>__{peter grinds his teeth, trying to make the next handhold. wham! something hits the gate below them!}
<L>__{interior by the elevator gate}
<A>__{the mimics are tearing at the metal gate. the albino remains still, watching them work.}
<B>__{peter and susan}
<A>__{susan's arm and legs are shaking now. her breath starts catching in her throat with the effort.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{don't hold your breath! keep it going, even flow!}
<A>__{susan tried, but can't. she tries to pull herself up to the next level.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{c'mon...}

<D>__{ah...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{talk to me.}

<A>__{susan pulls herself up.}
<C>__{susuan}
<D>__{i'm really glad i'm not pregnant.}
<B>__{reverse}
<A>__{we look down past them as they climb. two of the mimics and the albino have gotten into the shaft! the albino is so long it climbs by bracing its legs against opposite walls.}
<B>__{susan and peter}
<A>__{susan is crying, barely any strength left. peter does his best to stay in control, but in truth is barely hanging on himself. light hits them from the shaft above now, sounds of people talking and a muffled p.a. announcement filter down.}
<B>__{mimics}
<A>__{rushing upward on the shaft wall, higher, higher.}
