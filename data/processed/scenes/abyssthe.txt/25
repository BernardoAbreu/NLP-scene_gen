<D>__{your company has authorized the navy's use of this facility for a rescue operation. the code name is operation salvor.}
<C>__{one night}
<D>__{you want us to search for the sub?}
<C>__{demarco}
<D>__{no. we know where it is. but she's in 2000 feet of water and we can't reach her. we need divers to enter the sub and search for survivors, if any.}
<A>__{bud's scowl has been deepening since demarco started to talk.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{don't you guys have your own stuff for this type of thing?}
<C>__{demarco}
<D>__{by the time we get our rescue submersible here the storm front will be right on us. but you can get your rig in under the storm and be on site in fifteen hours. that makes you our best option right now.}

<C>__{finler}
<D>__{i'm here to tell ya', you could set me on fire and call me names.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{look, i don't know what kind of a deal you guys worked out with the company, but my people are not qualified for this... they're oil workers.}
<C>__{demarco}
<D>__{a four man seal team will transfer down to you to supervise the operation.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you can send down whoever you like, but i'm the toolpusher on this rig, and when it comes to the safety of these people, there's me... then there's god. understand? if things get dicey, i'm pulling the plug.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{i think we're all on the same wavelength, brigman. now let's get the wellhead uncoupled, shall we?}
