<L>__{exterior cliff top early morning}
<A>__{below, carter moves slowly by the edge of the sea. he raises the shotgun to throw it away. high on the clifftop a rifle and telescopic lens line up on carter. a finger curls around the trigger. on the middle finger of the same hand is a large gold ring with the letter 'j' engraved upon it. it is the man kinnear contacted after sending eric to his death. the finger tightens on the trigger and pulls it. there's a quiet, whooshing sound. carter drops to the ground.}
