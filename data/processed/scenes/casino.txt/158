<P>__{(sniffs.)}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{well, there you go. but what does that tell ya? a million dollars in jewelry. does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?}

<A>__{he moves closer to her.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{listen, ginger... you know, this is probably not... i don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with ace.}
<C>__{ginger}

<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i understand that. but, you know, i think you should try to make the best of it now. go slow, you know. see what happens.}

<D>__{he could have killed him! okay? he could have killed him.}
<A>__{she gets up and walks to the counter by the mirror.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{he didn't have to hit him. it's not exactly like i'm sleepin' with the guy! and he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! what the fuck is that all about?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{well, i guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. he's jealous and worried.}
<C>__{ginger}
