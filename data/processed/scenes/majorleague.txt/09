<L>__{interior rachel's office day cont}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{come on in, charlie. have a seat.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{i'm glad you called me in. i'm still unclear on a couple things}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{oh, really? like what?}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{well, if i'm the g.m., who's gonna be the manager?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i was thinking of lou brown.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{lou brown?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{he's managed the toledo mud hens of the international league for the last 30 years.}
<A>__{this is hardly an impressive credential to donovan.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i think he'll fit right in with our team concept.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{what exactly is our team concept?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{that's what i wanted to talk to you about. i want to put together a team that will help us relocate to miami.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<P>__{(referring to the roster)}
<D>__{some of these guys are furniture movers?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm serious about this, charlie. it's no secret i've never liked cleveland much. the weather's lousy, downtown is a pit, the stadium's falling apart, and we can't draw dick. another couple of years of this and i'm gonna have to start feeding cha cha dog food.}
<A>__{rachel bends down to give her dog, cha cha, a little love pat, while donovan tries to contain his disgust.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{mrs. phelps, you can't just up and move a team on a whim...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it's hardly a whim. miami's offered to build us a new stadium 62,000 capacity, 45 v.i.p. boxes, and no rent for the first million at the gate. plus a 12 million dollar media guarantee; 45 percent of the concession gross, all of the parking and they pick up the stadium operations costs. no other franchise in baseball can match that deal.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{even so, the league'll never let us leave cleveland. we got a lease with the city.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{the lease says we have the right to move if our attendance falls below 800,000 for the year.}
<P>__{(pushing across a copy of the lease)}
<D>__{paragraph 40, line 17.}
<A>__{donovan looks at it, the paragraph highlighted in yellow.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{if we play bad enough, we should be able to come in under that.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{what are you saying? you want us to lose?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{no, we've been losing. what i want us to do is finish dead last.}
<A>__{donovan is stunned. he casts around helplessly for some response.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{mister phelps would never have approved of this.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{he knew it had to be done. he just didn't have the courage to do it.}
<P>__{(with veiled menace)}
<D>__{hopefully, you will come to see the wisdom of it.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{if this team lives up to its potential, we could have the worst record in all baseball.}
<A>__{on donovan's sunken face, we go to:}
