<L>__{interior cabinet room night}
<A>__{kenny slams a page of khruschev's letter on the table. he jabs his finger at it. excom listens, intent.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{it's ten pages of sentimental fluff, but he's saying right here. he'll remove the missiles in return for a no invasion pledge. it looks like fomin's overture was genuine.}
<A>__{the president turns to mccone.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{our early analysis says this was probably written by khruschev himself. it's a first draft, and shows no signs of being polished by the foreign ministry. in fact, it probably hasn't been approved by the politburo. they wouldn't have let the emotionalism go by. the analysts say it was written by someone under considerable stress.}
<A>__{excom chuckles.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{glad to hear we're not alone.}
<A>__{the president eyes the excom members one by one, an incipient smile on his face.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{well, gentlemen, i wasn't planning on invading cuba anyway. i think we can live with the terms of this deal.}
<A>__{there are mostly nods of assent, big smiles around the table. except from mccone and taylor. the president takes his copy of the letter, flips through it. he shakes his head, almost unable to believe that khruschev has given in. a long beat.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{ted, i want you to draft our acceptance.}
