<C>__{rob }
<D>__{laura looks different. less stress out, more in control. something has happened, maybe something real, or maybe something in her head. whatever it is, you can see that she thinks she's started out on some new stage in her life. she hasn't. i'm not going to let her.}
<A>__{she emerges from doors, says something to him and they start walking, sharing her umbrella.}
