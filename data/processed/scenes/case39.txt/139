<D>__{she starts all over again somewhere else. can't let her stay, can't let her go. that leaves you with one option.}
<A>__{eye contact. emily looks away, shakes her head.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i can't, edward, i }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you have to. you have to find the strength. don't you understand? that's why she's doing this. to test you. test your faith.}

<D>__{i don't have any faith.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{how `bout anger. got some of that?}
<A>__{emily lowers her gaze to the table.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{how... how do i...?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{kill her? in her sleep, assuming you can...}
