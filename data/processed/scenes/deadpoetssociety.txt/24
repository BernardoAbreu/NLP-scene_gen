<C>__{mcallister}
<D>__{oh, there's no need to apologize. it was very fascinating, misguided though it was.}

<D>__{you think so?}
<C>__{mcallister}
<D>__{you take a big risk by encouraging them to be artists john. when they realize they're not rembrandts, shakespeares or mozarts, they'll hate you for it.}

<C>__{keating}
<D>__{funny, i never pegged you as a cynic.}
<C>__{mcallister}
<P>__{(taken aback by the comment)}
<D>__{not a cynic, a realist. show me the heart unfettered by foolish dreams, and i will show you a happy man.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{but only in their dreams can man be truly free. 'twas always thus, and always thus will be.}
