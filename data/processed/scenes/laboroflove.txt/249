<L>__{interior hospital chapel afternoon}
<A>__{a small chapel. stain glass windows overlooking the parking lot. maurice sits in his wheel chair at the back of the room. a few other patients are scattered in the four small pews. maurice has his hands folded tightly and stares up at the statue of mary. his concentration is broken as a man in a full black suit and black shirt sits next to him. maurice nods at the priest.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{hello, mr. parker.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{how are you feeling?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{confused. i'm not sure what to do now. i'm not sure what he wants for me.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{he wants to reward you... that's why i'm here.}
<C>__{maurice}
<P>__{(a little confused)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{i mean you've done a great thing. you should be rewarded monetarily.}
<A>__{maurice is lost.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{what's your shoe size?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{what? who are you?}
<A>__{the priest reaches into his jacket for the first time we see a polo design on his shirt and a gaudy gold chain around his neck.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{clive silver marketing executive at reebok.}
<A>__{maurice stares at the card in disbelief.}
<C>__{clive}
<D>__{we want you to do some spots for us.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{what the hell is this?}
<A>__{some of the patients turn around.}
<C>__{clive}
<D>__{i'm talking six figures, pay or play for two spots. we want to push a new line with you... america's new hero.}
<A>__{maurice is flustered. he can't take this. his eyes become desperate. clive waves his hands in the air excitedly.}
<C>__{clive}
<D>__{imagine grainy black and white shots of long stretches of highway quick cuts with a slow pounding beat underneath... then we see a man walking up a steep incline it's you maurice. we see shots of you walking. cut. cut. cut. fast... music crescendoes bham! close up and you say... 'reebok, because there's nothing you can't do.'}
<A>__{clive finishes. he is surprised to find maurice in tears. clive is thrown totally off as maurice stares at him angrily through streaming tears.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{my wife is dead.}
<A>__{maurice continues his powerful gaze until clive looks away. clive gathers his things and leaves the chapel without another word. maurice drops his head into his hands and cries quietly.}
