<D>__{stand back.}
<A>__{hicks snaps the torch off his belt and cuts into the lock. inhuman shapes enter the far end of the corridor. vasquez hands her flamethrower to gorman and unslings her rifle. she starts loading 30mm grenades into the launcher, like oversize 12 guage shells.}

<D>__{you can't use those in here!}
<C>__{vasquez}
<D>__{right. fire in the hole!}
<A>__{she pumps a round up and fires. the grenade explodes and the blast almost knocks them down. hicks kicks the door open, molten droplets flying.}
