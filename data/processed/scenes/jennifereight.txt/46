<L>__{45: interior attic apartment. institute. day.}
<A>__{gloomy windows and a wardrobe. berlin walks in leaving helena at the door. "i sat right there, on the bed." the bed is gone but why tell her? he checks the wardrobe. guess what? hangers.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{if i came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{of course i would ..}
<A>__{his smile deteriorates as he realizes she's "staring" at him.}
<D>__{what are you staring at, hel ena? .. i mean .. i'm sorry ..}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{that's alright. you suddenly reminded me of him .. he was standing right where you are, kind of breathless, like you.}
<A>__{nothing happening except the wind. then a smile as she leaves.}
<D>__{i will get my coat, wait for you downstairs ..}
<A>__{and he begins an exploration. musty bathroom with old fashion ed fixtures. a tap leaking behind shower curtains. nothing in the cabinet. nothing under the sink. six steps and he is in a kitchen. finally finds something worth looking for. tears the sack out of a vacuum cleaner. discovers a knot of hair from a black dog. simultaneously the door slams. shock powers him in to the sitting room in time to hear a key turning in the lock. hits the door and shouts. hears footsteps moving rapidly away.}
