<L>__{111 prefect's office. press hall. inside. day. february 25.}
<A>__{ben m'hidi is standing in front of the journalists with handcuffs on his wrists and ankles. he is without a tie. he is smiling a little, his glance ironical. there are two paras behind him with machine guns ready. the picture is still for an instant; ben m'hidi's smile is steady, so too his eyes, his entire face. flashes, clicking of cameras.}
<D>__{1st journalist mr. ben m'hidi ... don't you think it is a bit cowardly to use your women's baskets and handbags to carry explosive devices that kill so many innocent people?}
<A>__{ben m'hidi shrugs his shoulders in his usual manner and smiles a little.}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{and doesn't it seem to you even more cowardly to drop napalm bombs on unarmed villages, so that there are a thousand times more innocent victims? of course, if we had your airplanes it would be a lot easier for us. give us your bombers, and you can have our baskets. 2nd journalist mr. ben m'hidi ... in your opinion, has the nlf any chance to beat the french army?}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{in my opinion, the nlf has more chances of beating the french army than the french have to stop history.}
<A>__{the press hall in the prefect's office is crowded with journalists of every nationality. at the side and central aisles there are photographers and cameramen. ben m'hidi is opposite them, standing on a low wooden platform. mathieu is next to him, seated behind a small desk. mathieu now gets up, and signals to two paratroopers. another journalist simultaneously has asked another question:}
<D>__{3rd journalist mr. ben m'hidi, colonel mathieu has said that you have been arrested by accident, practically by mistake. in fact, it seems that the paratroopers were looking for someone much less important than yourself. can you tell us why you were in that apartment at rue debussy last night?}
<A>__{the two paras have moved forward and they take ben m'hidi by the arms. at the same time, he answers.}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{i can only tell you that it would have been better if i had never been there ...}
<C>__{mathieu}
<P>__{(intervening)}
<D>__{that's enough, gentlemen. it's late, and we all have a lot of work ...}
<A>__{ben m'hidi glances at him ironically.}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{is the show already over?}
<C>__{mathieu}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{yes, it's over ... before it becomes self defeating.}
<A>__{the paras lead ben m'hidi away. he moves away with short steps, as much as he can with the irons that are tightened around his ankles. mathieu has turned to the journalists and smiles again.}
