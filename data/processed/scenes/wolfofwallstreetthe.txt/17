<A>__{close on a coke spoon whose contents disappear up a nostril. pull back to reveal... the lunchtime power spot with panoramic views of the city. at a corner table, a paranoid jordan looks around as hanna does another bump of coke. none of the other diners seem to notice or care.}
<C>__{mark hanna}
<P>__{(offering the spoon)}
<D>__{got enough for one more? tootski?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{no. thanks though.}
<A>__{hanna slips the vial into his pocket as hector, the tuxedoed maitre'd, approaches.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{mr. hanna, what can i bring for you on this glorious afternoon?}
<A>__{hanna surreptitiously palms hector a $100; jordan notices.}
<C>__{mark hanna}
<D>__{here's the game plan, hector. bring us two absolut martinis straight up. precisely seven and a half minutes after you deliver those you'll bring two more, then two more every five minutes until one of us passes out.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{an excellent strategy, sir.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{actually, i'm good with 7 up.}
<A>__{jordan might as well have farted at the table.}
<C>__{mark hanna}
<D>__{first day on wall street, hector. give him time.}
<P>__{(hector offers menus)}
<D>__{no thanks, i'm not eating.}
<A>__{hector heads off.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you can get high during the day and still function?}
<C>__{mark hanna}
<D>__{high is the only way to do this fucking job. guy who coined the term "three martini lunch" was a woman. cocaine and hookers, my friend, the keys to success.}
<A>__{jordan smiles, not sure if hanna is kidding.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i gotta say, i'm really excited about being part of your team. i wanna do all i can for our clients and }
<C>__{mark hanna}
<P>__{(reciting an ad)}
<D>__{"here at l.f. rothschild, our clients aren't just important, they're family." just as long as we get our taste first. remember something, jordan, your top priority in this job: make us money. if the clients get rich along the way, bully for them. got a girlfriend?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{wife. she cuts hair.}
<A>__{mark swallows a comment about that. gets to business.}
<C>__{mark hanna}
<D>__{ok, first rule of wall street. nobody and i don't care if you're warren buffet or jimmy buffet nobody knows if a stock's going up, down or fucking sideways, least of all stock brokers. but we have to pretend we know. make sure you stay relaxed. nobody wants to buy something from someone who sounds like they haven't gotten laid in a month. take breaks when you feel stressed, jerk off if you can. you like jerking off, right?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{well... sure.}
<C>__{mark hanna}
<D>__{good, jerking off is key. and i highly recommend cocaine, which will make you dial faster, which is good for me. churn `em and burn `em, baby.}
<A>__{a busboy stops by with a fresh napkin for mark who thanks him. then, discreetly as possible, mark removes a fresh vial of cocaine tucked within and takes a quick snort. jordan realizes: that's why he palmed the maitre d' $100.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{for the next six months i learned the ways of wall street.}
