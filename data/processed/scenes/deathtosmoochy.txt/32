<A>__{three burly kidnet security guards drag randolph down the stairwell. they beat the shit out of him and toss him through the exit door.}
<L>__{interior frank stokes' office tight on new york post front}
<A>__{page day the headline reads: "rainbow randolph interrupts smoochy taping." the subhead reads: "runs onstage shouting penis related obscenities."}
<B>__{wide}
<A>__{burke sits on the couch next to sheldon, reading the paper. he shakes his head in disgust. nora sits in a chair near stokes.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{thank you all for coming. i just wanted to iron out a few wrinkles i feel we're having in the communication department. no finger pointing. lord knows when you start pointing fingers, someone gets poked in the eye.}
<A>__{sheldon laughs. stokes and nora sit stone faced.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{anyhoo, i'd like to turn the floor over to my new agent, mr. burke bennett. so... heeeeeere's burke!}
<A>__{sheldon applauds. burke stands.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{as you can imagine, my client has many concerns, not the least of which is studio security, but we can address that later.}
<A>__{he pats sheldon's head like a dog.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{see this guy, frank? take a good long look, 'cause this prick saved your life. without him you'd be sitting in kaplan's right now, sucking club soda through a paper straw.}
<P>__{(to nora)}
<D>__{and, you you'd be organizing puppet shows for the brats at p.s. 86. excuse me, honey.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{there's no excuse for you.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{man, i love club soda.}
<A>__{sheldon laughs, trying to lighten the mood. burke gives him an affectionate slap.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{we've always managed to come to some sort of arrangement, burke. why the fireworks?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{'cause i'm holding all the gunpowder. i represent the man who created, owns, and controls every square inch of smoochy the rhino.}
<A>__{burke pours himself a drink from stokes' private bar.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{god created adam and what did he get? a fucking dud. my guy? he breathed life into a winner. and anyone who does a better job than god is gonna have a price.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{burke, of course, is in no way comparing me to god.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{yes i am.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{you seem to forget that we went out and found 'your guy.' dug up his corpse. handed him his own show when he couldn't sell his face to a photo booth.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{to be fair, nora, i was booked to open a car wash in montauk.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{oh, so you were doing him a favor?}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{allow me to untangle this web of shit! i don't care what his resume was, i don't care where you found him, i don't care if his last job was juggling apples for a hut full of pygmies on the outskirts of the congo... the fact is, he fits a bill and you need him. like a hungry baby needs a big tit. and that, my friends, is why you're in a box with no ventilation. and that is why the rhino is going to get what he deserves.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{what is that, exactly?}
<A>__{burke walks over to stokes' desk and leans across it. he's an inch from stokes' face.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{heaven, hell, and everything in between.}
