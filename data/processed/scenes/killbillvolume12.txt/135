<L>__{exterior pit day}
<A>__{pai mei and the bride stand at the edge of a large, round deep pit, dug in the earth (by the bride).}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{in that pit, is a rat.}
<A>__{we see one lone rat in the huge pit.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{in the sky, is a bird.}
<A>__{pai mei brings a golden bow and arrow into frame, and shoots up in the sky. a bird falls to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through it.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{you are to go into that pit, and catch that rat, with your bare hands. if you catch the rat, i will deem you the victor, and tonight you will dine on bird. but, if you can't catch the rat by sundown, i will deem the victor the rat. and because of the disgrace to my student, i will be forced to kill it. and then i will force you, to consume his body. because to be my student, you must develop a taste for victory.}
<A>__{she hops into the pit, gets down on the ground, lock eyes with her rodent opponent, and goes after it. the bride practicing her tiger crane combo kung fu. more wall.... at night punching the wall in front of her in her sleep. trying to catch the rat to no avail.}
<B>__{when...}
<A>__{a golden arrow kills the rat. she looks up and sees pai mei, golden bow in his hand, looking down on her. it's sundown. she stands, dusting herself off (she's dirty from the chase) and looks at her teacher. she picks her dead foe up from the earth, and removes the golden arrow. then with the rat in her hand, she looks up to her teacher.}

<P>__{between her fingers.)}
<D>__{but tomorrow, you kill a big bird.}
<A>__{she pops the tiny rat heart in her mouth, and begins to chew. pai mei looking down on her, says;}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{how does victory taste?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{bitter.}
<A>__{we do a shaw brothers zoom into a cu on pai mei, he gives an affirmative nod and grunt. the bride's fist goes through the wall.}
