<L>__{interior kitchen tak night}
<A>__{the refrigerator is the perfect target for takâ€™s housebreaking skills. he turns once, looking over his shoulder before opening the amana... the light inside bathes everything in white. tak takes out a salad bowl and noshes from that, but his chewing is too loud so he opts for a beautiful new york steak wrapped in cellophane. placing the steak on the dark counter, tak stuffs a chicken leg into his mouth and searches the kitchen for a steak knife. he pulls his flashlight from his hip pocket and beings pulling drawers... a new sound is added to his search. a crawling gushy sound that bubbles and softly hisses. tak turns and sees a shape moving along the counter where he put the steak. approaching, tak tilts his flashlight so the beam hits the object moving on the counter.}
