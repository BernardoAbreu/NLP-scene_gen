<L>__{interior pyramid alien queen's chamber}
<A>__{a vast chamber. at its heart, a deep pool of freezing vapor not unlike the kind created by liquid nitrogen. hi tech chains of incredible tensile strength run from the ceiling and down into the vapor pool, disappearing from sight. the trigger verheiden stepped on has activated something and suddenly, the chains begin to move. they are pulling something up massive from the vapor pool. and slowly, majestically, she rises out of the freezing mist like some mythic beast an alien queen. a giant of her species. and around the alien queen is built a grotesque machine, in which she is being held prisoner. a complex web of pipes and tubes which pierce her body in a hundred different places. she is literally part of the machine, the ultimate bio mechanical synthesis. this machine which holds the alien queen prisoner, is clearly of predator design, for it has all the familiar techno medieval features. it could almost be some giant gothic torture device from the inquisition. as the chains continue to lift the alien queen into the air, we see that these shackles are attached to her every limb. there are even holes punched through the "crown" above her head, through which chains run. the lifting chains lock into place, leaving the alien queen suspended in mid air, hanging above the floor of the chamber like some great dragon caught in flight. it's a stunning, terrifying image. close on the alien queen unmoving. her head covered in a thin sheet of ice. residue of the freezing vapor in which she has been stored. suddenly, the ice begins to crack! without warning, the twin mouths of the alien queen shoot out and begin to snap at the air. she is waking up. her whole body struggles and strains against the chains. but in vain. despite her immense size and incredible strength, she is a prisoner here. close on the egg sack below the alien queen, held firmly in place by the predator machine that surrounds her. almost as soon as the alien queen awakes, she begins to lay eggs. beneath the egg sack is an automated conveyor belt which takes the eggs away from the alien queen. she lays every fifteen to twenty seconds, feeding the conveyor with a steady stream of eggs. we now see that the whole chamber is one giant machine built to service the captive alien queen. this could be an image from bosch or breugel. when the alien queen sees her eggs being taken from her, she goes berserk, straining against her chains to be free. but it is hopeless. the alien queen screams in frustration.}
