<C>__{devil in a blue dress}
<D>__{written by carl franklin from the novel by walter mosley march 9, 1994 3rd draft}
<L>__{interior champion aircraft benny giacomo's office}
<A>__{a battered wooden desk drawer groans open and light brown skinned hands with dirty fingernails twist the cap off a pint of rye whiskey and pour liquor into a coffee cup.}
<C>__{o.s. voice}
<D>__{you know, when you fire somebody you have to stick to your guns.}
<A>__{they screw the cap back on and lay the bottle in the drawer.}
<C>__{o.s. voice}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the men might get to thinkin' that i'm weak if i take you back.}
<A>__{the cup rises to the face of benny giacomo, late forties, with salt and pepper hair that was once jet black. skin darker than a louisiana creole. he takes a sip and bares his teeth in a grimace from the whiskey. as he talks we gradually see more of him feet kicked up on the desk, fully in charge. a betty grable like pin up girl is giving us background in more ways than one in a swimsuit and high heels on a calendar tacked to the wall: may, 1948.}
<C>__{benny}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and i didn't tell dupree that i'd give you your job back... all i said was that i'd be glad to talk to you if you said the right thing... do you have something to say?}
<A>__{a stream of cigarette smoke snakes through as the back of a man's head and shoulder nudges in and shifts nervously.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{mr. giacomo, when one of the white guys has come off a double shift and says he's too tired to work overtime, you don't fire him.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{fella, what'd i tell ya? if you're not willing to give a little extra, champion can't use you.}
<A>__{easy rawlins, thirty, handsome and a much darker brown than giacomo, takes a drag off a chesterfield cigarette. through the window behind him, a team of men pour over a partly assembled airplane, their voices echoing in the hangar that surrounds the office. benny measures out his words one at a time.}
<C>__{benny }
<D>__{now... do... you... have... something... to say?}
<A>__{easy swallows his frustration in silence and thinks about swallowing his pride as well. and then:}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i want my job back, mr. giacomo. i need to work and i need a good job.}
<C>__{benny }
<D>__{is that all?}
<A>__{easy looks down into the smoke and sits up straight to keep from bowing his head.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{no, that's not all... i need money so that i can pay my mortgage and eat... i need a house to live in and a place to raise children... i need to buy clothes so i can }
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{i'm sorry, fella, but i gotta get back to work...}
<A>__{and he swings his feet down and stands up to go. but easy is up too, blocking his way out the door.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{ezekiel, mr. giacomo.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{hunh?}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{my name is ezekiel... ezekiel rawlins.}
<A>__{benny clinches his fists and focuses on easy's chest like a fighter. and easy rocks back on one foot ready to score a field goal with his right knee. slowly, giacomo's face creases into a plastic grin and he shrugs.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{s'cuse me, ezekiel.}
<A>__{and he walks around easy, shaking his head as if amused. easy watches him go as the low moan of the baritone sax from duke ellington's "absinthe" snakes up like sin and we}
