<A>__{berlin pours last of the whisky. looks totally snuffed out. he and helena sit on the same sofa but the atmosphere puts them a mile apart. a yellow pad on the table covered in notes. berlin swallows scotch and reads to himself "i guess we all got lucky?"}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{you gotta stop drinking, darling.}
<A>__{another mouthful of scotch & she hears the glass hit the table.}
<D>__{he's glad you're drinking. every drink you take you're helping him.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{he doesn't need my help.}
<C>__{helena}
