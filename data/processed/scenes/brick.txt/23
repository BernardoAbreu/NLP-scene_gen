<A>__{by the time we got around to production this had changed to "someone to watch over me," but the publishing rights proved too expensive (i.e. not free.) we chose the gilbert & sullivan song, which besides being lovely was also in the public domain (i.e. free.)}
<L>__{interior living room same}
<A>__{brad bramish, the jock who was kissing laura in the parking lot, sits slouched on the couch in a dense crowd. he holds a cup and speaks much too loudly to a guy named biff at his elbow.}

<D>__{if the coach wants to play me i will play, but i can't put my best game in if i've got to worry about whether i'm going to be in there. halftime last game, coach is pissed i ran it on a pass play, out on the field he says to me 'you gotta think about the team and you gotta' you know and 'if you run that ball again you're out', and i said to him you gotta let me play! i'm out there, let me play, and he's saying 'no you're out' and i kept saying 'let me play! let me play! let me play!', just right in his face }

<D>__{just 'let me play! let me play! let me play!' 'no you gotta' 'no, let me play! let me play! let me play!'}
<A>__{brad hunches forward, his face swollen purple, yelling that over and over. tom steps in front of brendan, blocking his line of sight. brendan scans the rest of the room. his eyes catch on laura, leaning against a divan. her bright, sharp eyes cut through the room, straight into brendan. he wags his eyebrows at her. she looks away quickly. brendan turns back to brad, still shouting 'let me play'. tom stands between them.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{tom!}
<A>__{brad falls silent. most of the room follows suit. tom turns around. brendan smiles good naturedly.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{could you step aside, please? i'm trying to follow brad's story, and it's difficult when i can't see his face.}
<A>__{the room watches brendan. tom mumbles something and steps aside. brad stares at brendan stupidly. brendan flashes a dopey grin and tips his glass.}
<C>__{brad}
<P>__{(stumbles)}
<D>__{he doesn't give me a play to make, what can i do, you know?}
<A>__{he falls into awkward silence. biff starts babbling. brendan looks at brad, who is staring back at him. brendan then slowly drags his gaze over to laura, staring at him too, her eyes slightly amused. brendan cocks an eyebrow. the slightest hint of a smile takes the corner of her mouth, and she wags her eyebrows once at him. brendan glances back at brad, looking at laura now, not amused at all. brendan stands to go. biff chatters on. brad cuts him off.}
<C>__{brad }
<D>__{hey. hey! what are you doing here?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{leaving.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{uh huh. unless your anecdote's got a 2nd act.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{why don't you leave?}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(leaving)}
<D>__{that's what i was doing.}
