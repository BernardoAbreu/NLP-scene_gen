<A>__{he's looking directly at schaefer, except he can't}

<A>__{he can clearly see the exposed root system, but because of the heavy mud blocking schaefer's body heat, schaefer registers in the hunter's vision as merely an indistinct lump of clay, unrecognizable to the hunter as a human being. he scans the bank, searching, looking for heat sources. detecting none he moves on sounding a questioning trill several times. back to scene schaefer disbelieving that he's still alive, opens one eye, seeing the hunter's feet move away, his prehensile spurs dragging in the mud. he rounds a bend and disappears, heading for the undergrowth. astonished, he tries to raise up on his hands but a sudden jabbing pain in his shoulder causes him to collapse, falling onto his side, unconscious in the mud.}
