<A>__{then sound of shots, slamming doors, screams, shouts. szpilman and henryk hurry to another window so that they can see what's going on. their pov from second window building opposite and street: ss men herding a couple of dozen prisoners from the building opposite. people watching from the windows but trying not to be seen. the headlights of the ss vehicle are switched on and the ss men are forcing their prisoners to stand in the beam.}
<C>__{a german voice}
<D>__{run! run!}
<A>__{the prisoners start to run. the ss men open fire with a machine gun mounted on the vehicle. people in the building opposite begin to scream. the prisoners are being shot down. they are lifted into the air by the bullets, turn somersaults, fall dead. one man escapes by running back in the opposite direction, out of the beam of light and is lost to sight for a moment. the escaping man, a silhouette, out of the light, runs with all his strength, putting distance between himself and the ss. he starts to scale a wall. he looks as though he's getting away. but there's a floodlight on the ss vehicle. it flares into light, swivels and finds the man. a volley of shots. the man drops from the wall, dead. the ss men get into the vehicle and speed off, driving over the dead bodies.}
