<L>__{interior annabelle's apartment morning}
<A>__{dr. emil hobbes, a huge, florid, bearded man, is strangling annabelle horsefield. despite the difference in their sizes annabelle is tall and slender, about seventeen hobbes is not having an easy time of it. hobbes is wearing overlarge blue jeans and a red plaid shirt; annabelle is in a private girls' school outfit white blouse, dark blue tie, blue knee socks, pleated gray skirt. annabelle fights back fiercely; hobbes has tears in his eyes. the struggle takes them all over her apartment, which, although sparsely furnished, presents enough objects in their way to cause a lot of crashing around. at one point annabelle breaks loose and hobbes has to chase her. annabelle slips and hobbes manages to pin her to the ground, where he has the advantage of leverage. he strangles her quickly and with tremendous, crazy energy. blood oozes from her mouth. hobbes places his hand over her mouth as though trying to prevent her from speaking, or to prevent something from leaving her body. he reaches over to his leather doctor's bag, which has spilled some of its contents on to the floor, finds a surgical clamp, and clamps annabelle's lips together. he then picks up her body, carries it over to the dining room table and sweeps the few cups and bottles on it off on to the floor. he then places her body with great tenderness on the table and begins to undress it.}
