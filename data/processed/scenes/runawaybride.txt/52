<T>__{on tv:}
<A>__{we see the carpenter's backyard. it is gill and maggie's wedding day. the yard is crowded with a mixture of hells angels types, deadheads and townspeople. the "altar" is a band platform against the back fence. gill is waiting on the platform with a rock combo playing grateful dead type music. he makes an introductory speech. maggie steps out onto the back porch. she's beautiful in a hippie type wedding ensemble. she walks with her father to a trampoline. we can see her tattoo. she jumps on the trampoline, then dives into the crowd. they watch her and body surf her over their heads to the back fence. as she hits the stage, she looks at peggy and gill, then decides to go. she jumps off the stage and runs up to a passing guy on a dirt bike. she jumps on and turns and waves as she rides away. during the video, ike scribbles: "gill chavez". maggie goes off on dirt bike. the tape fast forwards to the last of maggie's fiascoes. on ike'stv he now sees the third wedding. it's outdoors, in a tree lined area, musicians plays. ike laughs as he discovers that maggie approaches the altar on horseback, in a simple white dress, wearing a crown of flowers. the maid marian look. ike slows the tape. on tv: it says, "george swilling wedding". as maggie rides down the aisle, suddenly the horse whinnies! maggie has kicked it in the shins. it rears and bolts, galloping off with the bride. ike freeze frames the tape on an image of maggie, hair blowing. although she is panic stricken, her soul seems to shine through in tat single frame. as ike stares at her, the smirk fades from his face. he just looks at her, allowing himself to see her expression, her eyes. he can't help it. she gets to him. ike gets a restless look on his face. he stares closely. the groom is george from the bar.}
