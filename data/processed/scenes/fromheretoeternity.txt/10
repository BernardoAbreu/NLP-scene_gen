<L>__{interior karen's bedroom night}
<A>__{medium shot 22 karen, in a negligee, is seated at a dressing table, brushing her hair steadily, gracefully, enjoying the sensual pleasure of it. karen is a woman of moods and tempers, spontaneous, quick to impulse. a car is heard pulling up in the driveway, the motor stopping. karen's brush strokes become faster, rougher. the front door is heard opening and holmes' voice calling, "karen." she does not answer. holmes enters. he seems to have had a few drinks. through the following, karen continues brushing her hair.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i'm sorry i'm so late. and about dinner, i }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{ i got tied up with general slater. bumped into him at the officers' club.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yes? what did the general have to say?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{success, he said. success in war, success in peacetime... and not a word about my promotion... there are times i think the old man's just waiting to ship me down...}
<P>__{(slumps into chair)}
<D>__{i've had a bad day all around...}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{started right off this morning... trouble with a new man...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{if you'd spend less time buttering generals and more time with your company, maybe you'd get that promotion.}
<C>__{holds}
<D>__{the company takes care of itself. or my topkick takes care of it.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i went over there this morning looking for you.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{i had some business to attend to in town. during the afternoon.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(unemotionally)}
<D>__{from the way you look i gather your business wasn't too successful.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{now what does that mean?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{dana. give me credit for a few brains.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{how many, times do i have to tell you i haven't any other women before you'll believe me?}
<B>__{close shot karen shooting into mirror on dressing table}
<A>__{karen laughs sharply, loudly, then stops suddenly as she looks at herself in the mirror, sees the repugnance in her face. she puts down the hairbrush, picks up a long comb.}
<C>__{holmes voice}
<D>__{if it were so, don't you think i'd admit it? the way things are between us now? what right have you to always be accusing me?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what right?}
<B>__{two shot}
<A>__{they are both tense now. holmes is out of the chair and pacing. karen combs her hair spasmodically.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{that again. how long will it be, i wonder, before i'm allowed to live that down? after eight years, how many times do i have to tell you it was an accident?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{that makes it all right, i suppose!}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i didn't say that. i know what it's done to you, but }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you know i hate to talk about it!}
<A>__{he moves over to her.}
<C>__{holm es}
<D>__{how many times do i have to tell you i'm sorry, about that? how many times that i had no way of knowing }
<A>__{he puts his hands on her shoulders. karen shakes away, rises, faces him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you had a way of knowing, dana. i want to go to bed. please get out of my bedroom.}
<A>__{holmes looks at her sullenly, then exits to adjoining room, closing the door behind him. there is a moment of silence, then a sharp snap as karen breaks the comb in two.}
