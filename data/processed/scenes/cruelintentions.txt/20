<L>__{interior caldwell apartment study day}
<A>__{close on: a hand stroking the bridge of a cello.}
<C>__{ronald }
<D>__{that's good, that's good.}
<B>__{we pull back}
<A>__{cecile sits in front of a cello. next to her sits ronald clifford, a well mannered fifteen year old african american. holding his own cello, he is giving her a music lesson.}
<C>__{ronald }
<D>__{now let's try the a minor scale.}
<A>__{cecile attempts the a minor scale, fucking up badly. kathryn enters and shudders in silence.}
<C>__{ronald }
<D>__{once more, and remember the third note is flat.}
<A>__{cecile tries again and once again screws up.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{oh, i suck. i suck.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{relax. it's okay. take a deep breath.}
<A>__{cecile takes a deep breath}
<C>__{ronald }
<D>__{you're concentrating too much on your bowing. let it flow.}
<A>__{he stands and sits behind her.}
<C>__{ronald }
<D>__{here, let me help you.}
<A>__{he places his hand over hers.}
<C>__{ronald }
<D>__{now close your eyes and let's try again.}
<A>__{she closes her eyes and they repeat the scale. it sounds much better. ronald takes the moment to study cecile's face. it's obvious he's smitten with her. on kathryn: who watches from the door. a grin crosses her face. ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful bach sonata, with he and cecile sharing the bowing. he closes his eyes as the music takes over him. now cecile opens her eyes and gazes into his. the feeling is mutual. on kathryn: she accidentally bangs her hand onto a table which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground. ronald and cecile look up as kathryn replaces the tray}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean to interrupt. your playing was beautiful.}
<A>__{ronald quickly stands and moves away from cecile}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{kathryn, this is ronald clifford. he's giving me music lessons over the summer.}
<A>__{ronald approaches and shakes kathryn's hand.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{pleased to meet you.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{likewise i'm sure.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{ronald is one of the few high school students attending juliard. he's composing his first opera.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{it's based on the life of doctor martin luther king.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{doctor king is my favorite.}
<A>__{ronald shakes his head, but laughs. cecile looks at him and smiles. kathryn rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{i guess our hour's up. same time tomorrow?}
<A>__{cecile nods.}
