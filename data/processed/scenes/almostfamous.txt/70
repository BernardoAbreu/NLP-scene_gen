<A>__{she shuts the door quickly. it hurts a little. he picks up the wadded pieces of paper, stuffs them in his pocket. he leaves the door and helps himself to some soap and pencils and matches from the nearby maid's cart. then he returns to russell's door. he can't help but listen to the muffled sounds of laughter, just for a moment, escalating. he flips the sign over: housekeeping please enter clean room.}
