<L>__{interior jackie's kitchen day}
<A>__{jackie and annabelle are sitting at the kitchen counter with maybe twenty hardboiled eggs. they are cracking the shells gently, and carefully peeling them.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{well, did you really think you'd meet someone at eleven that you'd spend the rest of your life with?}
<A>__{annabelle keeps her eyes on her eggs. a craftswoman.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{no, but i thought till thursday.}
<A>__{oh.}

<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i could help with the debate.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<P>__{(glum)}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(thinking it over)}
<D>__{actually. i could only help him.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{every time i'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded dorkface little adoring out crowd henchmen ...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you don't like his friends.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{...they all yell 'there goes the virgin queen' or the 'ice princess', or some really clever cut like that. like it hurts my feelings.}
<A>__{they keep peeling eggs.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you wouldn't kiss him, huh?}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{not with my mouth open.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{good girl.}
<A>__{annabelle's eyes well up. she covers by concentrating all the harder.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{and what do you do wh...}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{i call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you have to ignore him.}
<A>__{and on this. annabelle looks up.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{he's not even there. you don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{this is a joke, right?}
<A>__{jackie shakes her head. nope.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{all he wants is the attention. when he can't get to you, he'll try harder for a little while. then, he'll give up. it'll be no fun.}
<A>__{the kid blinks.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{you think rache would do that?}
<A>__{takes mom back a bit. enough for her daughter to notice.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{it's just she's younger. maybe she remembers how to do this.}
<A>__{jackie shrugs. maybe. annabelle studies her.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{this'll work, huh?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{oh, yeh.}
<A>__{annabelle takes heart from her mom's confidence. nods, with her trademark determination.}
