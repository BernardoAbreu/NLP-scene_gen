<A>__{streets. rome ext interior night it's late, but there is still traffic on the streets heading downtown. inside a high powered car, a man around fifty is driving. it is salvatore dl vita. elegant, just growing gray, a handsome face creased by deep wrinkles. his weary expression hides the determined, sell assured manner of the successful self made man. he must be a heavy smoker judging by the way he draws the last puffs on his cigarette. he stops at a red light. he stubs out the cigarette and rolls down the window, as a little fiat uno pulls up alongside. a rock tune plays full blast on the radio. salvatore turns instinctively to have a look at the man at the wheel a boy with a brush cut standing straight in the latest fashion. he studies the boy's expression with almost exaggerated attention, but devoid of curiosity, coldly. the girl sitting beside him, lots of curly hair, overripe red lips, returns salvatore'5 look, provocatively. the boy notices, turns to salvatore in a surly voice:}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{hey! what the fuck you looking at!?}
<A>__{green light. the fiat uno shoots off, leaving a trail of music in its wake.}
<C>__{salvatore s apartment. rome interior night}
<A>__{the apartment is luxurious, tastefully furnished. there is no one waiting for salvatore. through the picture window on the terrace, the city can be seen slumbering in the night. salvatore gets undressed on his way to the bedroom. he moves quietly, as if to make no noise. he doesn't even turn on the light, finishes getting undressed in the pale blue glow coming from the picture window. a rustling sound, a movement on the bed, the voice of a woman waking up.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{salvatore...but what time is it?}
<A>__{she turns on the bedside light. it is clara, a young woman around thirty. salvatore climbs in beside her under the covers, kisses her sweetly, then in a whisper.}

<D>__{it's late, clara. sorry, but i wasn't able to let you know i wouldn't be corning...}
<P>__{(he fondles her, but he is}
<D>__{tired, feels like}

<C>__{salvatore}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{and what'd you tell her?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i played dumb, so as not to disappoint her. we had a nice little talk. she says you never go see her, and when she wants to see you she has to come to rome...is it true?}
<A>__{salvatore doesn't answer. god only knows how often he's heard that question before.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{she phoned just to say that?}
<A>__{she reaches out to switch of the light, buries her head into the pillow.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{she said a certain alfredo had died. and the funeral's taking place tomorrow afternoon...}
<P>__{(a strange look suddenly}
<D>__{comes into salvatore's eyes. the idea of going to sleep has clearly left him. it's a piece of news he didn't expect. that's taken him off guard. clara would like to carry on the conversation, but sleepiness makes it almost impossible. an she can manage is one last question in a faint little}
<P>__{voice:)}
<D>__{who is it? a relative of yours?}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{no. sleep. go to sleep.}
<A>__{she falls asleep in the dead silence of the night. salvatore is seized by a sort of chill a deep, troubled feeling. he gazes through the window al the city, with its shimmering lights still moving in the darkness, suddenly shrouded in a heavy curtain of rain. but he gazes off, beyond the row of houses, beyond the dark sky; the shadow of a wind chime plays across his face summoning up endless memories, drawing forth from the infinite depths of oblivion a past that he thought had vanished, been wiped out, and instead now re emerges, comes back to life, takes on light, superimposing itself on the mellow middle aged features of his face, in the shadow of the city shaken by the storm, until another image is formed, an ancient, remote image...}
<C>__{church and sacristy. giancaldo interior morning}
<A>__{an image from over forty years before. in the baroque church of giancaldo. salvatore is nine years old. dressed as an altar boy, he is kneeling by the altar with a little silver bell in his hands. the congregation is also kneeling. the priest is consecrating the host. little salvatore has just got out of bed, is still half asleep, yawns and doesn't notice that the priest is standing there with the host in the air glaring at him, as if trying to tell him something.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{pss! pssst!}
<A>__{salvatore finishes yawning and opening his eyes meets the withering look of the priest. he gets the message at once and rings the bell. now the priest can carry on, lifts the chalice and the bell is heard again.}
<D>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the service is over. the priest is in the sacristy removing his vestments. and salvatore is also there, removing his altar boy tunic.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{but how can i make you understand? without the bell i just can't go on! always half asleep, you are! what do you do at night anyway? eat instead of sleep?}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{father, at my house we don't even eat at noon. that's why i'm always sleepy. that's what the vet says.}
<A>__{the priest has finished disrobing. he takes the bell salvatore was holding during the service and turns to leave.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{all right, toto, get moving, i've got things to do. say hello to your mother.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{can i...}
<C>__{priest}
<P>__{(interrupting him)}
<D>__{and don't ask if you can come... because you can't!! shoo, shoo, off with you!!}
<A>__{salvatore gives a shrug and leaves. the priest goes down a corridor, opens a door, another corridor, and finally a door leading to an outside courtyard. he cuts across it and disappears into another door.}
<C>__{interior cinema paradiso and projection booth morning}
<A>__{the priest enters a movie house. not very big 200 seats on the main floor and another seventy in the balcony. along the walls, posters of films to be shown are stuck up between the light fixtures. in one corner, a statue of the virgin mary with flowers. the cleaning lady has finished work and is leaving. up in the balcony, over the last row of seats, are the holes of the projection booth. the middle hole is camouflaged by the huge head of a roaring lion, all in plaster, and the lens of the projector can be glimpsed between its sharp teeth. there are two smaller holes, through which the figure of a man can be made out, appearing and disappearing...it is alfredo, the projectionist. he is around forty, skinny and bony with a tough peasant face. he has finished loading the projector and is checking the carbons in the arc lamp. then he removes the glass from one of the holes and looks down into the theatre, at the priest who waves his hand.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{ok, alfredo, you can start!!}
<A>__{he sits down an by himself in the middle of the empty theatre. up in the booth, alfredo lights the arc lamp and sets the projector going. down in the theatre, the light goes off and out of the lion's mouth streams the glowing ray aimed al the screen. string music, sweet and ominous, spreads through the theatre. on the screen appear the credit titles of an american film of the 1940s. the priest screws up his face and holds the bell in his right hand resting on the arm of his seat. at the back of the theatre, behind the last row, a curtain moves, opens a crack and salvatore's gaunt little face appears. he has managed to sneak in somehow and stands there without a word, spellbound, watching the 'movie' on the glowing screen. the credit titles have long come and gone. the story is at a turning pointerior up above, in the hole of the booth next to the lion, alfredo watches the film, but his eyes keep looking down at the priest, who is now drumming the bell with his fingers. on the screen, the male and female lead, two hollywood stars, are in close up; the dialogue is passionate, romantic. salvatore, carried away by those faces, by the way they talk, by the beauty of the woman, slowly slips down the length of the curtain until he is sitting on the floor, his eyes glued to the screen. the love scene reaches a climax, the music crescendos, and the love struck couple finally fall into each other's arms and kiss. instinctively, the priest raises the bell into the air, as in some age old ceremony, and gives it a loud ring... up in the booth alfredo hears the bell; it's the signal he's been waiting for. he takes a slip of paper from a pad prepared for that purpose and sticks it into the loops of the film containing that specific scene as it winds on to the reel. the projection continues... ...and also the kiss of the two actors. the priest's nervous look lingers on those black and white lips meeting and now pulling apart for one last declaration of love before separating. salvatore is wide eyed, he's probably never seen a man and woman kiss before, it's a vision that for him has all the attraction of forbidden fruit, the horror of sin. the screen is now filled with the figure of a woman getting undressed, showing for one instant the white, voluptuous flesh of her broad, naked shoulders. salvatore stares in open mouthed wonder. the priest, in a fury, grabs the bell and shakes it for all he is worth. from the sound of the bell to another sound...}
<C>__{main square. giancaldo exterior day}
<A>__{the tolling of the bell tower rings out over the square. it is noon. the vast square, pale and dusty, is alive with people. a noisy line of men, women and cows waits in front of the fountain to get water. peddlers hawk their wares in mournful cries. people come and go in front of the town hall. the working men's club is deserted. the entrance of the cinema paradiso is shut. hanging outside is the poster of the film that has just been seen on screen. up above, the windows of the projection booth are open. the hum of the projector can be heard and the loud, lofty music typical of 'the end'. then dead silence. the showing is over.}
<L>__{7. cinema paradiso. projection booth. interior day}
<A>__{despite the speed, numerous white streaks spin around on the reel, created by the slips of paper alfredo has inserted into the loops. he is rewinding the film by hand on the film winder. when he's not talking, alfredo usually sings to himself. salvatore stands beside him, taking in everything he does with those quick, thieving eyes of his}
<C>__{alfredo}
<P>__{(harshly, shouting)}
<D>__{you must not come here! how many times do i have to tell you?}
<P>__{(and he slows down the}
<D>__{reels with his hand. the slips of paper are about to arrive.}
<P>__{here's the first.)}
<D>__{if the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! and turn into a piece of...}
<C>__{salvatore}
<P>__{(overlapping him)}
<D>__{...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!}
<A>__{he's used to his terrorisms, pays no more attention. not even his grim look scares him. anyway, alfredo catches the joke, starts to give him a slap, but instead reaches over and picks up a pair of scissors.}
<C>__{alfredo}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{christ, that's a sassy little tongue you've got! watch out, or someday i will snip it off.}
<A>__{and he snips a piece of film, pastes the ends together and goes on turning the handle. salvatore picks up the strip of film and gives it a closer look. he sees a series of frames all alike with a man kissing a woman.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{can i have it?}
<A>__{alfredo snatches it out of his hand, furiously, at the end of his string. he shouts.}
<C>__{alfredo}
<D>__{no!!! are you deaf or something? i've got to put this back in when we wind up the film again! you're a real pain in the neck!}
<A>__{salvatore reaches into a basket full of strips of film. he takes out a handful: all kisses that have been cut.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{then why didn't you put these back when you wound up the films again?}
<A>__{alfredo is caught out. he stops the film where another slip of paper is stuck in and cuts the scene:}
<C>__{alfredo}
<D>__{'cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.}
<P>__{(finding an excuse)}
<D>__{besides, there are more kisses than you can count.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{so i can have these?}
<P>__{(alfredo explodes, flies}
<D>__{off the handle. he grabs salvatore by the shoulders}
<P>__{and shakes him.)}
<C>__{alfredo}
<D>__{look, toto! before i kick your ass all the way to china and back, let's make a deal. these strips here are yours, i give them to you. however! one you're not to stick your nose in here any more. two i will keep them for you, because you can't take them home for god forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! ok? oh!!! and now scram!}
<A>__{he takes him and turns him towards the stairs. for him the matter is closed. he returns to the film winder. salvatore sneaks back and while alfredo's attention is elsewhere, snatches up a handful of movie frames scattered on the counter, stuffs them into his pocket and...}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{what sort of deal is this? the strips are mine! so why can't i come see them?}
<A>__{and he stares at alfredo with a sly, saucy look. alfredo clutches his hand, darts forth like an arrow and is about to give him a kick in the ass. he shrieks:}
<C>__{alfredo}
<D>__{get out!! and don't show your face here again!}
<A>__{and before the kick reaches its destination, salvatore has already dashed off down the spiral staircase.}
<C>__{salvatore's house. giancaldo interior evening}
<A>__{that was not the first theft of film strips. salvatore's hand reaches into a flowery metal box jammed full of pieces of film. he takes out a few frames and holds them up against the kerosene lamp. gazes at the figures that remind him of the films seen at cinema paradiso, and in a whisper mangles fragments of dialogue, the shooting of guns, the musical climaxes...}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{bang! bang! bang! shoot first, think later! this is no job for weaklings! treacherous dog!}
<A>__{the house has no lights, is gloomy and cold. salvatore's mother, maria, is leaning on the table in front of him. she is young, around thirty, and her pretty face is haggard, marred by all the sacrifices. she is sewing some clothes, is a seamstress. lia, his four year old sister, is sleeping on a cot in one corner. the kerosene lamp projects the trembling shadow of the film strips on the wall, figures of prairies, gunslingers, thugs. salvatore's voice changes, turns even tougher.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{hey there, you lousy bastard, take your hands off that gold, you black hearted pig, stay away from me, or i will smash your face in! 'ntantatah!!!...}
<P>__{(in the heap of movie}
<D>__{frames there are also several photographs. salvatore picks them up. family keepsakes. a man in an army uniform. then the same man with a girl beside him whose smiling face can be recognized as maria. salvatore takes a closer look at the man's face, then whispers to his}
<P>__{mother:)}
<D>__{ma, if the war's over, how come daddy's never come back?}
<A>__{maria looks up at him with a sweet smile.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{he'll be back, he'll be back... you'll see. one of these days...}
<A>__{but there is not much conviction written on her face. she looks back down at her sewing. salvatore goes on looking at the photos.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{i don't remember him any morema, where's russia?}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{it takes years to get there. and years to come back...now go to bed, toto, it's late.}
<A>__{salvatore puts the photos back into the box and tucks the box under lia's cot near the charcoal burner.}
<C>__{courtyard. grade school exterior day}
<A>__{a noisy crowd of little children in black smocks, white collars and blue bows moves about the large courtyard where there are two tall palm trees. the boys head for one door, the girls towards the opposite one. the janitors line them up two by two, ready to enter. here and there, parents and relatives accompany the younger ones. beneath one of the palms, salvatore pulls off the altar boy tunic, stuffs it into the khaki colored cardboard schoolbag, takes out the smock and puts it on, as one of his schoolmates passes by. it is masino, and he's crying desperately because he doesn't want to go to school. his father drags him along, yelling:}

<C>__{interior fourth grade day}
<A>__{salvatore is sitting at the front row desk next to peppino, a little freckle faced boy. his attention, like that of the whole class, is concentrated on what is taking place at the blackboard. the teacher is standing there, watching a plump little boy, shy and not quite all there, do a two figure multiplication it is nicola scorsone, known as 'cola'. he is red in the face, has one purple ear and one white one. he stares in terror at that '255 x 15' written on the blackboard. the teacher yells, waving a birch rod in her hand.}

<A>__{cola stops to think a moment, then...}
<C>__{cola}

<D>__{it's all right. we'll talk about it later.}
<A>__{salvatore walks off towards the viewing theatre. salvatore is by himself in the small viewing theatre. now the lights go down. the beam of light shines out of the little square hole of the projection booth and the screen lights up. a number trailer goes by and then salvatore sees the first shots. a start of intense amazement and joy suddenly runs through him, astounds him, delights him. it's the best piece of film he has ever seen... it consists of all the kisses alfredo cut out of the films and kept for him, when he was a little boy. they have been spliced together, one , after the other, at random, same of them even upside down. and yet it looks like a first rate editing job. in rapid sequence the passionate kisses between actors and actresses, names famous and names unknown in the history of movies. greta garbo, gary cooper, alida valii, rudolph valentino, ingrid bergman, clark gable, anna magnani, humphrey bogart, marlene dietrich, amedeo nazzari, luisa ferida, vittorio de sica, rita hayworth, tyrone power, doris durante, massimo gironi, marta abba, fred astaire and ginger rogers, assia noris... a whole movie season summed up in a few fragments, a few seconds. a bizarre, poignant, melancholy parade. salvatore is overwhelmed, moved to tears. it is the most profound act of love he has ever seen. he laughs as tears shine in his eyes. up on the screen, another kiss, the last kiss marking the happy ending of a film. and the age old words appear 'the end'.}
