<A>__{the guard takes cholo's weapons and returns a claim check. cholo collects his boxes and steps onto an escalator that carries him up into an enormous atrium. the "mall" we saw on tv. sunlight splashes through glass walls onto box planted trees. caged birds chirp seemingly in tune with the chopin that lilts over a sound system. shoppers, expensively over dressed, stroll past stores. other residents lunch at "outdoor" cafes. cholo pulls out a kerchief and wipes the smudges off his face, trying to make himself presentable.}
