<L>__{exterior snow's island night}
<A>__{marion sits at cornwallis' ornate, folding campaign desk, reading cornwallis' journal, surrounded by cornwallis' field gear which includes furniture, music boxes, oil paintings and an elaborate folding commode. the two great danes sit nearby, eyeing marion warily. the men have divided themselves into two groups, one coarse, the other civilized, each clustered around a separate fire. the coarse men, including dalton, brother joseph and randolph, a grizzled, black toothed mountain man, drink and laugh loudly, wearing cornwallis' wigs askew. the civilized men, including rev. oliver, gabriel, scott, fielding and abner, talk quietly. marion puts down the journal and walks over to the campfire where the rougher men are gathered. he stands just inside the firelight and speaks loudly, so that all can hear:}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{today was hard earned but a good start.}
<A>__{marion looks at dalton, then turns to the other men as well.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{in the future wounded british soldiers will be given quarters.}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{like they gave quarter to my family? my wife and three children were hiding in our root cellar when they came. the redcoats locked the door and torched the house.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you have my sympathy... but the order stands.}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{and who are you to give an order like that? we all know what you did after fort wilderness.}
<A>__{that hits home but marion remains calm.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i'm your commanding officer. this is militia, not regular army. i can't hold you here, but as long as you stay, you'll follow my orders.}
<A>__{marion looks from face to face. most begrudgingly nod. that's enough for marion. as he heads back to his own campfire he's intercepted by rev. oliver who speaks to him out of earshot of the other men, except for gabriel and billings who overhear.}
<C>__{rev. oliver}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{rev. oliver}
<D>__{for trying to impose some decency on that sort.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{don't depend on my decency. i'm one of that sort.}
<A>__{marion walks on. rev. oliver exchanges a look with gabriel, then heads off. as marion joins gabriel and billings at his campfire, billings grips his bottle.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{am i one of that sort?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you're the worst of that sort. you're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.}
<A>__{billings considers that, then shrugs and takes a long drink. he hands the bottle to marion who takes an equally long drink. marion picks up his pennsylvania rifle.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i'm going to check the watch.}
<A>__{he disappears into the darkness leaving gabriel and billings at the campfire.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{he shouldn't make light. that redcoat should not have been killed.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{he's not making light.}
<A>__{gabriel shoots billings a dubious look.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{you don't know him very well, do you?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{he's my father.}
<A>__{billings looks closely at gabriel.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i know him well enough?}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier. it was a harder time and a harder place than you know.}
<A>__{gabriel looks at billings, then turns back to the fire.}
