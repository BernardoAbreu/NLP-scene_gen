<A>__{the man, wearing a fedora, is in the f.g. of an extreme low angle whose b.g. is the bottom three or four stories of the hudsucker building. the passerby reacts to the approaching yell, looking up just as hudsucker enters frame. freeze frame to suspend hudsucker a good twenty feet above the sidewalk, arms and legs splayed, comically arrested. the passerby is frozen in an attitude of surprise and disbelief. super the title of the film: the hudsucker proxy. unfreeze to send hudsucker plummeting through the frame to his rendezvous with the sidewalk, below frame.}
<B>__{dutch angle}
<A>__{the hudsucker building lists up into the distance. a woman in a fancy fruited hat with a black veil rises into frame at an opposing slant. looking down at the sidewalk, she sends two dismayed hands to her cheek and screeeeeeeeeams.}
