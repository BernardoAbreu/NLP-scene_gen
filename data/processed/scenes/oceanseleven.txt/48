<L>__{interior tishkoff's living room later}
<A>__{along one wall, a buffet table has been set up, and while virgil and turk pile shrimp onto plates, saul pockets an orange for later.}
<C>__{turk}
<D>__{you make it out to utah much, saul?}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(last man you'd see in the tabernacle)}
<D>__{not as much as i'd like.}
<C>__{turk}
<D>__{you should. you'd like it. you'd like provo.}
<C>__{virgil}
<P>__{(scarfing a jumbo shrimp)}
<D>__{anybody see the salsa goes with this?}
<A>__{at the wet bar, basher mixes a drink for livingston; on a couch, yen balances coffee table ornaments into a skyscraper, to frank's astonishment. in a corner, off on his own, linus watches the company, his eyes narrowing, wary. until...}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{gentlemen: welcome to las vegas.}
<A>__{danny stands at the top of the stairs leading into the room, flanked by rusty and tishkoff. he starts down...}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{everybody eaten? good. everybody sober? close enough. most of you know each other already. you probably haven't met linus caldwell before, he's bobby's kid outta chicago.}
<A>__{linus trades nods around the room.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{okay. before we start, nobody's on the line here yet. what i'm about to propose to you happens to be both highly lucrative and highly dangerous. if that doesn't sound like your particular brand of vodka, help yourself to as much food as you like and safe journey. no hard feelings.}
<P>__{(pauses, soberly)}
<D>__{otherwise, come with me.}
<A>__{he turns and walks out of the living room, into another. rusty is close behind; he turns briefly, casts an eye over the assembled and keeps going. the guys look each other over, sizing things up.}
<C>__{basher}
<D>__{what the hell.}
<A>__{and he follows, along with frank and livingston. then virgil, turk and yen. then saul. that leaves linus, watching the line of men disappear. he turns to find tishkoff by his side, staring at him.}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{tishkoff}
<D>__{you're bobby caldwell's kid, huh?}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{tishkoff}
<D>__{from chicago?}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{tishkoff}
<D>__{it's nice there. you like it?}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{tishkoff}
<D>__{that's wonderful. get in the goddamn room.}
