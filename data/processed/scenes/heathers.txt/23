<L>__{interior school conference room day}
<A>__{at the head of a long conference table is the bearlike principal gowan. circling the table is the gray haired but savvy mrs. pope, the black counselor paul hyde, the yuppie math teacher kevin staples, and most noticeably, the eccentrically dressed ms. pauline fleming. coats are in chairs and cigarette smoke is in the air, as the group batters their way through a morning mourning conference.}
<C>__{principal gowan}
<D>__{any other principal would take the same position. keep things business as usual.}
<C>__{counselor hyde}
<D>__{heather chandler's not your everyday suicide. she was very popular.}
<C>__{principal gowan}
<D>__{i let the kids go before lunch and the switchboard'll light up like a christmas tree.}
<C>__{kevin staples}
<D>__{the parents will be sympathetic, sir. these are troubled times for the young.}
<C>__{mrs. pope}
<D>__{i must say i was impressed to see that she made proper use of the word "myriad" in her suicide note after brutalizing it in a vocabulary test.}
<C>__{pauline}
<P>__{(dramatically cutting in)}
<D>__{i find it profoundly disturbing that we are told of a tragic destruction of youth and all we can talk about is adequate mourning times and misused vocabulary words.}
<A>__{a collective sigh goes across the room.}
<C>__{principal gowan}
<D>__{oh christ.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{the school, meaning both students and teachers, must revel in this revealing moment. i suggest we get everyone into the cafeteria and just talk. and feel. together.}
<C>__{principal gowan}
<D>__{thank you, ms. fleming. call me when the shuttle lands...now is this heather the cheerleader?}
<C>__{counselor hyde}
<D>__{that would be heather mcnamara.}
<C>__{principal gowan}
<D>__{damn. i'd be willing to go half a day for a cheerleader.}
<C>__{kevin staples}
<D>__{let's just pack it in an hour early.}
<C>__{principal gowan}
<D>__{done. i hate mondays.}
