<A>__{jack waits at the bar, watches the door anxiously.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{come on, exley. where are you?}
<L>__{interior 1736 nottingham (lynn's) living room night}
<A>__{spent, exley and lynn sit, half dressed, on the floor. they're quiet. then, through a smile:}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{how was i?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{oh, the best i ever had. absolutely the best.}
<C>__{exley}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{you sound like you mean it.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{the silver screen's loss is your gain.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{how about white?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you want to know what bud's like in bed?}
<A>__{she actually embarrasses him with that one.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{i want to know why you see him. is it a patchett payoff?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i see bud because i want to. i see bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{i will take your word for it.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i see bud because he makes me feel like lynn bracken and not some veronica lake look alike who fucks for money. i see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is. there's more if you want to hear it.}
<A>__{exley shakes his head. he's heard enough.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{i don't hate white. i really don't. it's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you don't like that you don't know how to play him. he doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do. that makes him dangerous.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{you cut to the heart of things, don't you? what about lynn bracken? she going to be a hooker all her life?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i came out here with a dream. that's gone, but i settled for reality.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{some reality.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{no. this is the means to the reality. but i'm not going to tell you what it is.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{because you'll use it against me. won't you?}
<A>__{exley doesn't answer, but the answer is yes. lynn smiles.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you're tougher than bud thinks you are.}
<C>__{exley}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you're the first person to ever call me tough.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{like recognizes like. i'm pretty tough, myself.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{you, me and white, huh?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{actually, bud's only tough on the outside.}
<A>__{as exley kisses her...}
<B>__{in closet}
<A>__{exasperated that he's still stuck in here, sid hudgeons checks his watch, shakes his head in disgust.}
