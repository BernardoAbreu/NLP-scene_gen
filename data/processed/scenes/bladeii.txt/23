<A>__{daylight bleaches the image, almost whiting it out. a wino sifts through refuse, collecting bottles. three mutts are tethered to his side with rope. he reaches for a bottle, cuts himself on a piece of glass. as he inspects his wound, his dogs growl. the wino looks up a black kid (14) is standing atop a mountain of refuse wiry and intense, perched there like a predator. the wino glances at his wrist again, the blood, then back up at the black kid. unnerved, the wino starts to back away, then turns bumping right into the black kid, who has moved beside him with uncanny speed. (note: this all happens within a single, continuous shot.) the boy slams the wino against the trestle wall and snarls, baring fangs. and just as he's about to tear the man's throat out a hand reaches in from off screen, pulling the boy back. it's whistler, twenty years younger and spryer, with a head full of raven black hair. whistler throws the boy into the light, forcing him onto the ground. he shoves a .45 against the boy's face and is just about to pull the trigger when he stops, noticing overhead sun reflected in the boy's eyes. whistler looks up and sees the sun at high noon, then glances back at the boy in understanding. he smiles.}
