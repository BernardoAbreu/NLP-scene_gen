<L>__{exterior matt's backyard afternoon}
<A>__{the camera turns on; from the quality of the picture, it's immediately evident that this is a newer, better camera. it's on a tripod, and matt stands across a well manicured backyard; his hair is a little different, time has passed.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{rolling, yeah.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{okay, ball test. take one.}
<A>__{a baseball comes flying in from behind the camera, nailing matt in the face; he drops like a rock.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{ow fuck! what the fuck steve! underhand!}
<A>__{steve comes in from off camera to help matt, laughing; we can hear andrew laughing behind the camera, too.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i'm sorry, oh shit, i'm sorry }
