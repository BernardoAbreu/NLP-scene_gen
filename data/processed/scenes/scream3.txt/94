<D>__{oh poor john. there's not gonna be another film. well, at least not for you.}
<A>__{the elevator door opens with a ping. a flash of silver and in an instant, john's throat is slashed open, spilling blood. his corpse thuds to the ground. a pair of gloved hands drag him into the elevator. a moments pause and then the ghost storms out, disappearing down the hall. the elevator doors close on milton's corpse.}
