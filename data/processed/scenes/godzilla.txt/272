<A>__{as our heroes come rushing around a corner, godzilla bursts through the building in front of them, sealing off their exit. raymond notices a very narrow alley. angle alley way raymond leads them through this slim alley between to large brick buildings. they run for their lives as godzilla appears behind them. his claws are too big to reach into the alley so he bulldozes his way into it, the building ripping apart as he marches forward. bricks go flying as debris showers down on our team just they make their way to the other side. slowed down by the the position of the alley, godzilla swings his arms violently to clear a path.}
