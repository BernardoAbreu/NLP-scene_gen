<A>__{palm trees are streaking past the window. the sun is glaring hot. a group of kids in bare feet and straw hats wave to the bus as it passes.}
<L>__{interior greyhound bus day}
<A>__{ratso's eyes squint in a dazed half sleep. joe leans across to pull down the shade. he hesitates a moment, watching... ... past his reflection, a group of young men on their way to work, carrying lunch pails, dressed exactly as joe is now dressed... ... then joe lowers the blind and seats himself. ratso nods slightly, his voice practically inaudible.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{thanks, joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{shee it, you know, i got this thing all figured out, ratso. i mean rico. when we get to miami, what i will do, i will go to work. i gotta do that, 'cause see, i ain't no kind of a hustler. i ain't even any goddam good as a bum. i'm a nothing, that's what i am. so reckon i'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. okay?}
<A>__{joe glances at ratso, but there is no response. surreptitiously, joe takes out a cigarette, turns his face away from ratso and lights it, hiding it cupped in his hand as he smokes.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{yeah, guess that's what i'm gonna do.}
<A>__{they ride for a moment in semi darkness, joe smoking, looking at the other people on the bus, brighter without the shades down. joe turns, checking the blanket around ratso, noticing that ratso is sitting in a peculiarly stiff, awkward position. joe leans over to straighten ratso's head, blocking our view for a moment. then joe leans back, frowning, thoughtful. we still do not see ratso's face. joe rises slowly, starting forward in the bus... ... passing an older couple, a schoolgirl, two ladies with straw hats, a young man trying to read, pausing when he reaches... ... the driver, staring out at the sunshine parkway with the driver, leaning over so he won't have to speak too loudly.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{yes, sir? joe, my friend's dead in the back seat.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{your friend's what in the back seat?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{dead. dead as a doornail.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{is this some kind of...}
<A>__{he glances at joe, then pulls off the road and stands up.}
<C>__{driver }
<D>__{okay, folks, everything's fine. nothing to worry about.}
<A>__{the passengers crane their necks as joe follows the driver to the rear of the bus. the passengers at the rear are staring ahead, trying not to see what is going on. the driver touches ratso, straightens, touches his hat, but doesn't remove it.}
<C>__{driver }
<D>__{is he kin to you?}
<A>__{joe nods no.}
<C>__{driver }
<D>__{don't you want to close his eyes?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{close them?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{just reach over and close them. that's all.}
<A>__{joe closes ratso's eyes.}
<C>__{driver }
<D>__{i guess we'll just drive on, right? nothing else to do.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no, sir. not till miami. i will see to burying then.}
<A>__{the driver moves to the front and turns to the passengers.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{just a little sickness, folks, nothing serious. we'll be in miami...}
<P>__{(looks at watch)}
<D>__{... in forty minutes.}
