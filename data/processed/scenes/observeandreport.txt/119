<L>__{interior mall day}
<A>__{ronnie comes into the mall and makes his way down the center of it, feeling naked without his uniform. charles, now wearing a mall security uniform, comes out and stops ronnie.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{ronnie, what are you doing back here?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i just came to talk to nell. don't get your panties in a wad, i'm just here as any normal patron.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{ronnie, dude, i've been all fucked up in the head. i feel like shit about what happened. i mean, here i am, just looking to shuck responsibility and i ended up hurting you in the process. look, i should have been honest with you. i don't give two shits about this stupid job. but you do.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{it's okay, charles.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i've decided i'm going back to college. getting stoned and studying beats this any day. i realize that now. i realize that there aren't any jobs where you can avoid hard choices. anyway, take as long as you want at the mall. i will keep mark off your back.}

<D>__{thanks, charles.}
