<A>__{brady sits on a couch in the lobby playing with his action figures. a hooded movie actor type (25) sits slumped next him texting on a phone. carrie, miranda, charlotte and samantha are having brunch at a table nearby.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{yes, it's sad, but i'm not going to make it any sadder by staying at a bad hotel while i look for a place. pass the salt.}
<A>__{charlotte passes the salt.}
<C>__{miranda }
<D>__{plus, i have to be downtown and close to brooklyn. we're going to keep things as normal for brady as we can. i will pick him up on my days... take him over on steve's.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i don't know if this question is allowed but how is steve handling this?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{says he's devastated begs me to forgive him.}

<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{miranda, honey are you sure you want to do this? it's just one time. anyone can have a slip.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{well, even if i could get my head around that justification it's the cheating part the behind my back part... the violation of the trust that's the thing that's killing me.}
<A>__{samantha nods, taking it in.}
<C>__{miranda }
<D>__{besides... women who stay with men who cheat are women who are afraid to be on their own. and that's not me i can handle it. always could.}
<A>__{brady walks over holding an action figure.}
