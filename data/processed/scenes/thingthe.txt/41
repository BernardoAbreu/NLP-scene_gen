<L>__{exterior the main building the door}
<A>__{macready and dr. copper stand hesitantly amidst the wisps of snow and embers. macready tries the door. it is unlocked. he slowly pushes it open with his gun. a creaking. a long pitch black corridor. copper shines a flashlight.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{anybody there?!}
<A>__{no answer. just wind. they exchange a look and enter.}
<L>__{interior narrow corridor}
<A>__{the two men move slowly. it is dank and cold. their breath, bleating like exhaust. a soft, steady wind howls overhead. the flashlight is not much help. further down, they hear a faint hissing sound. as they get closer it more resembles static. the flashlight finds a door at the end of the corridor. the sputtering static comes from within. the face of the door has been shredded. an ax sticks out from its middle. macready wrenches out the ax. there is blood on it. the men acknowledge this for a beat. macready tries the knob. it opens slightly. something is blocking it from the other side.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{anybody in there?!}
<A>__{nothing.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{we're americans!}
<A>__{nothing.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{come to help you!!}
<A>__{macready pushes against the door.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{give me a hand.}
<A>__{they push, shove, grunt. the door gives a bit. finally more. it widens enough for macready to see that a large computer like machine is blocking their path. macready wedges in and shines the flashlight. it is the communications room. holes in its roof have allowed in the freezing cold. the flashlight exposes the back of the radio chair. one more nudge allows them into the room. a beat as they catch their breath. macready spots a coleman lantern. he lights it with a match. holds it up. the brighter light exposes the top of a man's head sitting in the radio chair.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{hey, sweden...! you okay?}
<A>__{the chair rocks slightly with the gentle breeze. they inch closer. a yard from the chair, macready stops the doctor. he pokes his gun at the chair's back.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{sweden?!}
<A>__{dr. copper spots something. from the man's wrist on the armrest, he follows a long, yarn thick, red line, ending in a pool of frozen blood on the floor. the two men step around the chair. the norwegian stares up in blanched death. a gaping black hole for a mouth. his throat and wrists slit. an old fashioned straight razor in his lap. macready turns off the hissing radio, and marches to the other door. it is locked and barricaded.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<P>__{(more to himself)}
<D>__{my god, what in hell happened here?}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{come on, copper.}
<A>__{the two men free a machine like obstacle from the other exit. macready opens a lock and pushes the door open. more blackness. stronger wind. copper holds the lantern high as they make their way down a row of wooden steps and into a cavernous, underground causeway.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{hey, sweden!!!}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{they're not swedish, goddamn it, they're norwegian, macre }
<A>__{whap!! something slaps into the doctor's face from the darkness. the lantern crashes to the ground. the doctor stumbles, falls. macready grabs the flashlight and whirls in different directions. a panting beat. silence. dr. copper holds up what hit him. a thick centerfold, buffeted by the wind. macready takes it.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{norwegian of the month, doc. harmless.}
<A>__{macready pockets it for further viewing.}
