<L>__{interior cave gabe and maggie}
<A>__{dust from the rockslide is drifting past the cave opening, but the worst is over. gabe rolls maggie over carefully.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{my ears are ringing but i'm all right. gabe, what's going on?}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(shows money in his pack)}
<D>__{this. that plane crash it's a half dozen guys who were smart enough to steal fifty million bucks, but dumb enough to drop it all over the range. they've got hal as a bird dog and right now they're heading for the rest of it.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{it's close to the lake hal's probably leading them on the slowest possible route down to it.}
<P>__{(stiffly gets up)}
<D>__{i can get there first all i have to do is make it along the north wall to the bitker ladder }
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{"all?" jesus, gabe what do you expect to do then?}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(aching)}
<D>__{something subtle.}
<A>__{gabe lurches towards the cave opening, looking more like quasimodo than a champion climber. maggie stops him.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{i'm going with you.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{no way. you're climbing back down try to get to the station or find some help.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{i'm just as good a climber as you are and right now, i'm definitely in better shape.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(hard)}
<D>__{and you're definitely not going }
<A>__{maggie stares gabe down. guess who won all the arguments when they were together. gabe's face is a portrait of familiar exasperation.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{okay. come on }
<A>__{as they move out of the cave together, gabe favors one foot.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{ but the second you slow me down, i'm leaving }
<P>__{(slips on sore leg, maggie catches him)}
<D>__{ i'm leaving you behind. understood?}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(helping gabe out)}
<D>__{anything you say, gabe.}
