<L>__{exterior the tanis digs morning}
<A>__{sallah's truck drives through the camp, one of the arab diggers at the wheel. indy and sallah are in the back and look just like the other two arab diggers. sallah's truck does behind a tent and when it appears on the other side, indy and sallah are gone.}
<L>__{exterior among the tents morning}
<A>__{indy and sallah move stealthily among the tents. indy carries a smooth wooden staff almost seven feet tall. they stop between two tents and look across a path at the entrance to the map room. what appeared to be a mound of dirt is actually the roof on the ancient building. the hole entrance is a five foot square skylight. indy looks around, then walks casually to the edge of the hole and looks inside. sallah joins him, producing a length of rope from his robes. indy drops the staff into the unseen map room as sallah ties the rope around on oil drum. when it's secure, indy wastes no time disappearing down it into the map room.}
