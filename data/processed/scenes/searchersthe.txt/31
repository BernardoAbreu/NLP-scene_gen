<A>__{debbie sits on the floor, playing with a little rag doll. the slanting blaze of the setting sun makes a brilliant area of light in which she is sitting. beyond her, on the porch steps, ben is squatting, whittling a piece of pine into a slingshot frame. we hear martha and lucy busy with the dishes. aaron comes from behind camera and stands in the doorway, absently rapping out his pipe. near the doorway, on a wooden peg, hangs his gun, belt. he puts the pipe in his pocket and glances down at deborah, intent on her play. he looks swiftly at where the women are busy then stealthily eases the gun from its holster and slides it under his shirt. he hasn't made a sound and is sure he's got away with it. he clears his throat noisily and reaches for a light shotgun pegged above the door.}
