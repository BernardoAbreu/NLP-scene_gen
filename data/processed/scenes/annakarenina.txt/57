<L>__{interior reception room, oblonsky house night}
<A>__{with only a lamp or two lit, and the door open, anna sits alone at the card table, with a neglected book, one hand playing idly with the alpha bet bricks. their pleasant clicks are the only sound as she remains lost in thought. she closes her book, marking the place. she is going to go up to bed. she hears the sound of the doorbell.}
