<L>__{9mm, and her state carry permit. the security guys check}
<A>__{her pistol like a coat, giving her a claim check. through the crowd in the lounge lenny's eyes go immediately to one table. it seems to be in a pool of light all it's own; or maybe this is just in lenny's mind. slow motion: lenny watches a man at the table holding court, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him. it is tran vo. he's a mover and shaker in the record business: he produces, he manages, he tries to keep everyone in his orbit. the woman is faith justin. we recognize her from playback as lenny's ex girlfriend. but now her hair has been dyed jet black and frames her face in a wild tangle. she is wearing as expensive custom leather jacket over a sheer silk top. she has on too much make up, which gives her features a feral doll quality. faith looks like what she is, a rock star wannabe. but the look is red hot. tran looks around the room. his eyes miss nothing. and show nothing. his hand unhurried, graceful, remarkable brushes past faith's cheek, barely touching her. his fingers pick up a strand of hair, tuck it like a treasure behind her ear... fingers touching her head now... a moment of suspended time. ... and she trembles. just a little. for a second. tran and faith are flanked on either side by an entourage consisting of music types, various hangers on, and tran's personal security force of four: joey corto, a whippet thin skinhead; duncan, a none too bright armbreaker in the classic mold; a massively built ex jock type called wade beemer; and a sixteen year old asian stone fox, cindy minh, aka 'vita', possibly the most lethal of the four.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{who's the new side of beef in tran's posse?}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{guy named wade beemer. used to be a running back for the rams in '96 and '97.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{rams... that's football, right?}
<A>__{he can't take his eyes off faith. mace scowls at the tableau and pulls lenny toward the bar.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{forget her.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{she still loves me.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{she thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit. trust me on this.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{she's my destiny.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{destiny? you living in a perfume commercial? she's a hard climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{you'll see.}
<A>__{mace gives up, shakes her head and lenny plunges into the crowd... toward faith. several patrons greet him, just as in the coral lounge, but uncharacteristically, lenny virtually ignores them. approaching the main table now. ringside. tran sees him; no reaction. now faith sees him: her reaction's a little tougher to read. pissed off, maybe, or just tense. tran's security force has seen lenny coming. but they stay casual. lenny doesn't break stride. it's like a game of chicken without cars. beemer stands, covering lenny with his shadow. vita looks up at lenny with cobra eyes. tran gives him a glance; royalty amused by lenny's presumption.}
<C>__{tran}
<D>__{you come to peddle me some tapes, lenny? for old time's sake? make a couple bucks for the holidays?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{you're not a client anymore, tran. i wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.}
<C>__{tran}
<P>__{(glancing at faith, back at lenny)}
<D>__{i already got everything i need from you.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{cut it out, tran.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{too bad about your guy jeriko. tough break.}
<C>__{tran}
<D>__{show a little respect, nero. the man was an important artist.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{yeah, important for your label. which no doubt is why you're in mourning. don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. you'll make out.}
<C>__{tran}
<D>__{i always do.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{faith, can i talk to you a second?}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{i don't think that's a good idea, lenny.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i just got to talk to you for one second.}
<C>__{tran}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{that would be between me and faith, wouldn't it?}
<A>__{tran takes one of his beautiful hands and passes it slowly in the general area between his table and lenny.}
<C>__{tran}
<D>__{i don't feel anything between you. see, your trouble is you assume too much, lenny. you assume there's something where there's nothing. you assume you have a life. but you're only hustling pieces of other lives on tape, and broken parts of your own.}
<A>__{faith glances at tran, then cuts her eyes to lenny.}
<C>__{faith}
<P>__{(icy)}
<D>__{we have nothing to talk about, lenny.}
<C>__{tran}
<D>__{joey, make sure mr. nero gets safely to his car.}
<A>__{joey smirks, glances at beemer who rises like a wall.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{faith, call me, okay?}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{no, lenny.}
<A>__{wade gets lenny in a wrist grip come along hold and starts him moving. she looks at him slowly, gaze unwavering. as beemer ushers lenny through the crowd, tick greets him coming the other way.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{tick, listen, i can't stop right now. but i will call you tomorrow about that thing we were talking about.}
<A>__{he's working the room even as he's getting dragged outside.}
<C>__{tran}
<D>__{lenny the loser. panhandler of stolen dreams.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{leave him alone, tran.}
<C>__{tran}
<D>__{he's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him. don't talk to anybody. you understand? not with everything that's going on right now.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{you're too goddamned paranoid.}
<C>__{tran}
<D>__{paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.}
