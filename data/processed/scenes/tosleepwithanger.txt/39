<L>__{exterior apple orchard day}
<A>__{the trees are barren, which gives them an unfriendly look. as we look at the ground, a man's distorted shadow stops in the frame.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior front porch day}
<A>__{a shadow of a man appears on gideon's porch. the camera tilts up to harry mention, a very dark looking, ageless old man carrying several boxes held together by a cord. he looks exhausted from his journey. he looks in his address book and, satisfied that he reached the right house, he rings the doorbell.}
<L>__{interior front room day}
<A>__{suzie comes to the front door; she recognizes harry right away. she invites him in. harry stumps his feet on the porch several times and then enters.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{harry, i can't believe it is you. gideon, look who is here.}
<A>__{gideon comes in, wiping his hands. sunny, carrying the broom, follows behind.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{harry, good god almighty, man! it's been, what, thirty years or more. suzie, we haven't seen harry since we left home.}
<A>__{harry is more interested in the boy, but sunny doesn't want to come near harry. it is gideon's arm that is keeping him within close range of harry.}
<C>__{gideon }
<D>__{this is my grandson, sunny. he is my youngest son's child.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{he kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.}
<A>__{sunny, playing with the broom, accidentally touches harry's shoe with it. harry hides his anger about being touched with the broom. harry takes the broom from sunny and spits on the bottom of it.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{he knows better. sunny, apologize to harry.}
<C>__{sunny}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{what are you doing in these parts?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i came all the way from detroit by bus going to oakland. the bus stopped in los angeles. i had to get off and take a rest. i will catch the last bus leaving at midnight. i'm just too tired to go on.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{why didn't you catch a plane?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{my feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{stay until you feel better? i would like to hear all the news.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, i don't want to put you out.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. we have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well if you're sure, i won't be a bother. oh, i don't sleep on no spring mattress. i always make myself a pallet on the floor.}
