<A>__{a lone arrow remains in timmons' dead body, jutting out of his privates. now the pawnee warriors pass by, heading for home in no particular hurry. the toughest passes by with timmons' scalp hanging from his bow. none of the men give timmons a parting glance.}
<L>__{exterior sedgewick bluff day}
<A>__{we're close on dunbar, his face is grimy with sweat and dirt. he's working hard at something. we pull back and see that dunbar is half way up the bluff, he's been filling up the pockmarks, the holes where cargill's men once lived. exhausted, he stabs the shovel into the fresh earth and pauses to look over his work, all of the holes have been filled. his eyes sweep over the prairie across the river. he sees something moving, it's the wolf. dunbar instinctively goes for his rifle. before he can bring it up to aim, he has second thoughts. he lowers the gun and watches the wolf a moment longer, then walks up the hill and disappears into the sky.}
