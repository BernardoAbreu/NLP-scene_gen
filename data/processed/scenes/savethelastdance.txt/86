<L>__{interior exterior city bus sara and patrick later}
<A>__{the bus makes a stop and an older white woman gets on. sits across from sara and patrick who have moved even closer to each other. patrick's arm is around sara's shoulder. he whispers something in sara's ear. she laughs and looks up to see the white woman staring at them with a muted but obvious repugnance. watching the woman from the corner of her eye, sara drapes her arms around patrick's neck, nuzzles at his ear. patrick's eyes widen. sara, playing this for all it's worth, folds one of her legs between his and whispers:}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{we have an audience. work with me.}
<C>__{patrick}
<P>__{(nonplussed)}
<D>__{work with you?}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(sotto voce, through her teeth)}
<D>__{grab something.}
<A>__{he grabs her ass what else is there? runs his hand along her side. the white woman, thoroughly disgusted, gets up and moves to the back of the bus. patrick and sara look at each other, burst out laughing.}
