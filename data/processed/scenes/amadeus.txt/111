<L>__{interior a grotto room next door night 1780's}
<A>__{a fantastic room designed as a rocky grotto, lit by candles. a forte piano to one side is being played by schikaneder: the music of ich mochte wohl der kaiser sein cross fades to another tune. this is vivat bacchus from il seraglio which schikaneder, dressed as bacchus, is humming as he plays. the music is actually accompanying a game of forfeits, which has begun. five couples (the group we have just seen) are dancing in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs. when the music stops they will each have to find a chair, and the one who fails must pay a forfeit. constanze is dancing with leopold; mozart is dancing with one of the actresses; the two other actresses are dancing with two other gentlemen; and two children dance together a little boy and a little girl. the scene is watched by a circle of bystanders; among them from the doorway is salieri. schikaneder stops playing. immediately the couples scramble for the chairs. leopold and constanze meet on the same chair, bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession of it. to the amusement of the people around, the chair over balances and they both end up on the floor. constanze immediately gets up again, sets the chair on its feet, and tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time. but schikaneder calls out from the forte piano.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{no, no! you both lost. you both lost. you both have to forfeit. and the penalty is you must exchange your wigs.}
<A>__{people are delighted by the idea of this penalty. the children jump up and down with excitement. the three actresses immediately surround leopold, reaching for his hat and mask and wig, whilst he tries to hold on to them. mozart takes off constanze's wig an absurd affair with side curls. constanze laughingly surrenders it.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{no, please! this is ridiculous! no, please!}
<A>__{despite his protests an actress takes off his hat, to which the smiling mask is attached, to reveal his outraged face showing a very different expression underneath. another actress snatches off his wig to reveal very sparse hair on the old man's head. the third actress takes constanze's wig from mozart and attempts to put it on his father's head.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{no, really!}
<C>__{mozart}
<P>__{(calling to him)}
<D>__{this is just a game, papa.}
<A>__{constanze echoes him with a touch of malice in her voice.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{this is just a game, papa!}
<A>__{laughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the children.}
<C>__{bystanders}
<D>__{this is just a game, papa!}
<A>__{as leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds in getting constanze's wig firmly onto his head. everybody bursts into applause. delightedly, constanze puts on leopold's wig, hat and mask: from the waist up she now looks like a weird parody of leopold in the smiling grey mask, and he looks like a weird parody of her in the silly feminine wig. schikaneder starts to play again, and the couples start to dance. leopold angrily takes off constanze's wig and leaves the circle; his partner, constanze, is left alone. seeing this, mozart leaves his partner and catches his father entreatingly by the arm.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{oh no, papa, please! don't spoil the fun. come on. here, take mine.}
<A>__{he takes off his own wig and puts it on leopold's uncovered head. the effect, if not as ridiculous, is still somewhat bizarre, since wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs. he takes constanze's wig from his father. as this happens, the music stops again. mozart gently pushes his father down onto a nearby chair; the others scramble for the other chairs; and he is left as the odd man out. he giggles. schikaneder calls out to leopold from the keyboard.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{herr mozart, why don't you name your son's penalty?}
<A>__{applause.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{yes, papa, name it. name it. i will do anything you say!}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i want you to come back with me to salzburg, my son.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{what did he say? what did he say?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i'm tired of this game. please play without me.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{but my penalty. i've got to have a penalty.}
<A>__{all the bystanders are watching.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{i've got a good one. i've got the perfect one for you. come over here.}
<A>__{mozart runs over to the forte piano, and schikaneder surrenders his place at it.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{now, i want you to play our tune sitting backwards.}
<A>__{applause.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{oh, that's really too easy. any child can do that.}
<A>__{amused sounds of disbelief.}
<C>__{schikaneder}
<D>__{and a fugue in the manner of sebastian bach.}
<A>__{renewed applause at this wicked extra penalty. mozart smiles at schikaneder it is the sort of challenge he loves. he defiantly puts on constanze's wig and seats himself with his back to the keyboard. before the astonished eyes of the company he proceeds to execute this absurdly difficult task. his right hand plays the bass part, his left hand the treble, and with this added difficulty he improvises a brilliant fugue on the subject of the tune to which they have been dancing. attracted by this astonishing feat, the players draw nearer to the instrument. so does salieri, cautiously, with some of the bystanders. constanze watches him approach. only leopold sits by himself, sulking. the fugue ends amidst terrific clapping. the guests call out to mozart.}
<C>__{guests}
<D>__{another! do another! someone else.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{give me a name. who shall i do? give me a name.}
<C>__{guests}
<D>__{gluck! haydn! frederic handel!}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{salieri! do salieri!}
<A>__{smash cut: salieri's masked face whips around and looks at her.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{now that's hard. that's very hard. for salieri one has to face the right way around.}
<A>__{giggling, he turns around and sits at the keyboard. then, watched by a highly amused group, he begins a wicked parody. he furrows his brow in mock concentration and closes his eyes. then he begins to play the tune to which they danced, in the most obvious way imaginable, relying heavily on a totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and dominant, endlessly repeated. the music is the very essence of banality. the bystanders rock with laughter. mozart starts to giggle wildly. through this excruciating scene, salieri stares at constanze, who suddenly turns her head and looks challengingly back at him. mozart's parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding a fart noise instead of notes to end cadences. he builds this up, urged on in his clowning by everyone else, until suddenly he stops and cries out. the laughter cuts off. mozart stands up, clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his breeches. the momentary hush of alarm is followed by a howl of laughter. cu, salieri staring in pain.}
