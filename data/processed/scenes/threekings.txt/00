<L>__{exterior iraqi desert day}
<A>__{wide angle pov of wide open desert, flat grey sky. the camera is running forward, toward a big sand berm in the distance. there are o.s. sounds: soldier's equipment clanking, boots running on sand. hear a man's breathing. the back of his helmeted head and his uniformed shoulders appear in the bottom of the frame, running. this is troy barlow, sargeant, u.s. army, 25 years old. on his helmet is a photo button with a photo of a newborn baby. suddenly, on the sand berm 100 meters ahead, an iraqi soldier stands. troy stops in his tracks, out of breath, and stares at the figure on the berm. the iraqi flutters a white flag over his head, then puts it down and picks up a gun. troy turns around, we see his face for the first time.}

<B>__{pov through rifle scope}
<A>__{the iraqi soldier in the cross hairs. hear troy's breathing, loud, as he pulls trigger slowly. slow motion rifle sound. silent pause. the iraqi soldier stands there, then his neck explodes like a sack of blood. silent, except for sound of troy's loud breathing as he walks toward the big berm, and up to the crest. all we hear are his footsteps and breathing.}
