<D>__{great evening, isn't it?}
<C>__{college chick}

<C>__{oz}
<D>__{there's something about the spring that's just cool. like the smell of fresh rain or something.}
<A>__{at this, she snuggles up to him. oz smiles confidently.}
<C>__{oz }
<D>__{suck me, beautiful.}
<A>__{the college chick backs off, confounded.}
<C>__{college chick}
<D>__{what did you just say?}
<C>__{oz}
<P>__{(not so confidently)}
<D>__{suck me...beautiful?}
<A>__{the college chick's eyes flutter in disbelief. she tries to keep her cool but can barely restrain her laughter.}
<C>__{college chick}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{oz attempts to maintain a suave exterior, but he's just had the rug pulled from under him.}

<C>__{college chick}
<D>__{alright, well...you've got to tone it down. you don't need to go to lookout point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{...okay...}
<C>__{college chick}
<D>__{you have to pay attention to a girl. be sensitive to her feelings. relationships are reciprocal.}
<C>__{oz}
