<D>__{how do you feel, dejesus?}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(obviously embarrassed to be singled out)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{better let the doc take a look at you, after dinner.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{yeah, since he was busy earlier when you needed him.}
<A>__{he cracks up and beck turns on him.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{cut it, sixpack.}
<A>__{sixpack shuts up, but beck notices the others feel the seriousness of doc's absence during the emergency.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{leave the doc to me. i'm going to talk to him.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<P>__{(sarcastically, under his breath to bowman)}
<D>__{'makes me feel better already...}
<A>__{beck gets his tray but it is clear he is thinking about something else. he clears his throat.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{uh, oh...i see where this is going...}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(ignoring jones)}

<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(erupting)}
<D>__{no way, mister beck! no fucking way ! we just did a full shift, you can't call shack duty on top of a full shift. it's a contract violation!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{whooo! right on, cobb! let's hear it for our shop steward!}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{hear that becky, er, mr. beck? company got to abide by the rules.}
<A>__{five faces stare at beck. they're looking for weakness.}
<B>__{this is a challenge to his authority.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i know all about the contract. the point is you can follow the goddamn contract to the letter and pull your shack duty tomorrow...or you can get it done tonight and call tomorrow a down day. it's up to you.}
<A>__{this leaves the group momentarily speechless. even dejesus comes out of his stupor.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{you giving us a day off?}
<A>__{beck nods. cobb eyes him suspiciously.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{what about our quota?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{you're only twenty five tons off quota. barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.}
<P>__{(he looks at the group)}
<D>__{it's just a day off. you don't have to take it, i just thought it might help.}
<A>__{the others look around for agreement but jones doesn't need anyone else's approval, he's already made up his mind.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{count me in.}
<A>__{bowman nods her head also and the others unanimously agree. buoyed, beck moves ahead, businesslike...}
<C>__{beck}

<P>__{(to bowman and sixpack)}
<D>__{bowman and sixpack...living quarters...}
<C>__{sixpack}
<P>__{(disgustedly)}
<D>__{shit...}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{williams...get dejesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics.}
<P>__{(to group)}
<D>__{any other suit problems she should know about?}
<A>__{sixpack suddenly looks up as the group disperses.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<P>__{(to willie)}
<D>__{my pocket. check my pocket, will ya, honey?}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{your pocket?}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{the latch is screwed up. or the hinge.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{lower ring corridor same on beck he starts out of the mess and by chance finds himself walking with willie. beck is obviously uncomfortable with the crew, even after 28 days together. she smiles, friendly, at ease.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{you did good...}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(a little surprised)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{today...with dejesus. that was smart thinking to get him inside...}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{there probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{still...you did the right thing.}
<A>__{she turns off toward the swamp, leaving beck with the tiny, but honest compliment. he savors it. the swamp later the "swamp" (where dejesus came up), is ankle deep in greasy bilgewater. the door slides open, willie enters, and switches on a bank of fluorescent lights. the room is spooky even with the lights. the giant machine suits, we saw earlier outside, hang from racks like sleeping monsters. willie straps on a utility belt and checks her tools a motorized screwdriver, a power wrench, a long necked, laser tipped soldering iron(looks like a long necked screwdriver) then splashes through the bilge water to the control switch and hits the start button. nnnnnnnnnn. a motor moves one of the suits along the track toward willie. as it turns the corner toward us we see it says: dejesus. doc's office same beck opens the door to doc's quarters and we see doc putting on a fresh shirt. a man in his 50's, he must have once been quite handsome and intelligent, but has now gone to seed.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i must have dozed off.}
<A>__{beck looks on the cabinet and sees a bottle of old granddad whiskey. he picks it up.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{snakebite medicine...never pack my bag without it.}
<A>__{beck doesn't smile. he puts the bottle back down and doc watches him in the mirror.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{are you planning on working tomorrow?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{well, i will be on the golf course in the morning. then, if i don't have any babies to deliver }
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{we almost had an accident today. dejesus' suit...}
<A>__{the doc stops buttoning his shirt and locks eyes with beck.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you got something to say to me, son?...}
<A>__{beck definitely has something to say, but confronted, he falters.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i...i think it's important to have the second officer on deck.}
<A>__{doc smiles, and goes back to buttoning his shirt.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i will keep it to nine holes in the morning.}
<A>__{the dormitory same small but functional. the bunks can be closed off with a privacy door. photographs and bumper stickers on the walls of the bunks provide the only personal touches in an otherwise sterile environment. willie's bunk is wallpapered in detailed interplanetary maps; sixpack's privacy door has a bumper sticker which proclaims: "i may be fat, but you're ugly and i can diet." dejesus' has posters of the alps, and the rockies; bowman's has clipped pages from "gourmet" of meals she dreams for; cobb's has nothing, as if perfectly content to be where he is instead of somewhere else. inside jones' bunk is an indoor basketball goal. bowman and sixpack scrub down the walls of the dorm with a sponge and pail. sixpack pauses and smirks, his eyes on bowman's chest.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{christ...what a pair...}
<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{what was that? what'd you say?}

<D>__{i said, "what a pair" the boy wonder shack boss and his drunken doctor buddy make...}
<P>__{(innocently)}
<D>__{why? what did ya think i said?}
<A>__{corridor "a" same jones and cobb are kneeling in a corridor, unfastening a big plate on the floor with a power wrench. overhead a huge plexiglass conduit flows with water from the desalinization system. the interior wall of the corridor is meshed wire exposing the throbbing machine floor of the shack. cobb removes the last bolt and jones lifts off the floorplate exposing the guts of the shack the bilge dark and wet. without the plate the rattle in the air system is much louder and sinister.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{listen to it for christsake.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{ah, it's just old, like me. you don't see the doc opening me up every time i get a new creak in my joints...i say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. but, 'long as we're here...}
<A>__{he pulls a retractable ladder from inside the hole and drops it down into the wet darkness, without hesitating he climbs down, stopping at the bottom to look up at jones. jones seems in no hurry to accompany him.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you gonna sit there on your butt or give me a hand?}
<A>__{jones reluctantly starts down after him. beck's quarters same beck in his quarters. he seems to be talking to himself but as we move around him we see he is talking to a video monitor. on screen we see martin, 30's, a slick bureaucratic executive with transocean corp. whose face is all we see on the video monitor.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{two hundred and fifty two tons of magnesium and 15 tons of sodium.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(taking notes)}
<D>__{sounds like a good week, beck. in fact...i put your folder in front of the vice president of district operations last night...}
<A>__{beck stops. martin notices his concern.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you're good executive timber, beck. a lot of management trainees wash out when they have to go under for their first tour. but you've done well.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(smiles, relieved)}
<D>__{thank you, martin.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'know what i mean?}
<A>__{he stares hard at beck, but doesn't wait for an answer.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{the one thing i've learned in this company is you can't have enough friends. it's the only way to survive.}
<A>__{close on a boom box lower ring corridor same the boom box sitting on a wall pipe is blaring john denver's rocky mountain high. dejesus is singing along loudly in his thick accent as he works on the intercom system. he finishes, closing a metal box which says: onboard communications. swamp same on willie she has connected dejesus' suit to the diagnostic computer and is going through the computerized checkpoints an electronic list of literally hundreds of possible problems.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{probably a short.}
<A>__{suddenly, the computer pauses on one: it says: electrical short.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{good guess, williams.}
<A>__{she types in a "help" command and the computer screen displays an electrical circuit pattern that would leave most electrical engineers baffled. willie hardly bats an eye.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{piece of cake.}
<A>__{she immediately opens the circuit panel on dejesus' suit and pulls the laser soldering iron out of her tool belt. with two quick spot welds she repairs the short, then replaces the panel. finished, willie presses the control switch and the suits begin to move along the track. a new suit rounds the corner toward us. it says sixpack. the bilge same the walls are dark and moist. water drips from the pipes. the rattle in the air system continues loudly as jones leans over and hands cobb another tool. crouched in the humming machinery, cobb spits his wad of chewing gum into a greasy hand, kneads it a couple of times, then grins at jones.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{okay, watch this..}
<A>__{the swamp same the monotonous clatter of the air system is the only sound in the gloomy swamp as the huge suit labeled sixpack stops directly in front of willie. she reaches up to open the pocket latch when she stops...listening. the noise in the}
<B>__{air system has stopped.}
<A>__{the bilge same jones looks incredulously at cobb. he can't believe that's all it took. cobb starts gathering up the tools.}
<C>__{jones}

<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{shhhh...don't tell no one.}
<P>__{(winks)}
<D>__{job security.}
<A>__{the swamp same in the gloomy silence, willie reaches for the hinged pocket in the waist of sixpack's suit. some water drips out. she pushes the spring a second time. the pocket opens. nothing.}

<D>__{nothing wrong with this...}

<B>__{swamp}
<A>__{willie watches the sea spider move in the water toward her as beck's words come over the p.a. ignoring beck she watches the spider right as it moves to her feet then brings the soldering iron down into the water with a loud hiss skewering it. she presses the intercom button and lifts the skewered sea spider out of the water.}
