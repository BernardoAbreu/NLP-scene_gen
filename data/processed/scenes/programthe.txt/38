<L>__{exterior e.s.u. campus morning}
<A>__{opening day of school. we take cuts of students arriving, football players checking out the new girls from atop the wall of the athletic dorm, louanne and autumn greeting returning sisters at the sorority, students registering for classes etc.}
<L>__{interior academic advisor's office morning}
<A>__{darnell sits across from william smith, academic advisor.}
<C>__{advisor smith}
<D>__{darnell, i've reviewed your placement test and i'm afraid you failed to meet our entrance requirements in two areas.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{what does that mean? i can't play football?}
<C>__{advisor smith}
<D>__{no. it means you're going to have to take some remedial classes, what we call "zero level" courses. specifically math 0 and english 0.}
<A>__{darnell is clearly deflated by this painful indication of his academic standing.}
<C>__{advisor smith}
<D>__{you won't get college credit for them, but they will help you prepare to take the placement test again at the end of the quarter. if you pass at that time you'll be able to officially enter the university and take college level courses. you'll still be able to take an american history survey course, but it won't count on your record until you pass the placement test. but first things first. to start, i'm approving a tutor for you.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{a tutor? i don't need no tutor.}
<C>__{advisor smith}
<D>__{any tutor. and yes you do.}
