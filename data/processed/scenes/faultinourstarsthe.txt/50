<L>__{int hospital conference room days later}
<A>__{hazel and her parents sit at a very large conference table along with dr. maria and three other oncologists her whole "cancer team."}
<D>__{oncologist #1 the great news is... phalanxifor continues to control your tumor growth.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the not so great news is we're still seeing serious problems with fluid accumulation.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so how should we proceed?}
<A>__{silence. hazel looks around the room, waits for someone to answer. no one does.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{um, i feel like i'm not the most qualified person to answer that. oncologist #1 i was talking to dr. simmons.}
<A>__{dr. simmons (late 60s, white beard, old school) speaks nexterior}
<C>__{dr. simmons}
<D>__{it's a strange case. normally the tumors start resisting the treatment. but that hasn't happened here yet.}
<A>__{hazel hears the "yet" the loudest.}
<C>__{dr. simmons}
<D>__{unfortunately, the drug may be worsening the edema.}
<C>__{dr. maria}
<D>__{but if we stopped it entirely, we're likely to face even graver dangers.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{so we're gonna do nothing?}
<C>__{dr. maria}
<D>__{that's what we have to decide. the truth is... very few people have been on phalanxifor as long as hazel has. we don't really know the long term effects.}
<A>__{that comforts no one.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{can't i just get like a lung transplant or something?}
<A>__{the doctors look at one another like "who wants to take that one?" eventually:}
<C>__{dr. maria}
<D>__{you would not be considered a... strong candidate for a transplant.}
<A>__{hazel takes that in, nods, tries to pretend it didn't bother her. sensitive michael on the other hand starts to cry a little bit. he grabs frannie's hand.}
<C>__{dr. simmons}
<D>__{we're trying to prevent endothelial growth while at the same time preventing immunosorbent...}
<A>__{as dr. simmons drones on with some cancer gobbledygook, hazel's eyes remain firmly fixed on her parents. she hates what she's doing to them. and seeing them holding hands, crying but trying not to cry it jogs a memory. cut to:}
