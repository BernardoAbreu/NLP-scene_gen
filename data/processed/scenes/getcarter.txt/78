<A>__{the pelaw hussars keep on marching. the back of their banner a stirring motto for youth and valour.}
<L>__{interior boarding house day}
<A>__{scene as before.}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{did you sleep well?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{yes, thank you.}
<A>__{he puts his arm around her and moves on top.}
<L>__{exterior boarding house day}
<A>__{as the band executes another movement, a red jaguar slides to a halt outside edna's house. two men get out. peter the dutchman and con mccarty are definitely not local lads. they look, and are, lethal. they try edna's front door. it opens.}
<L>__{interior boarding house day}
<A>__{scene as before.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{are you tired?}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{no. are you tired?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{no. i'm not tired,}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{do you eat breakfast?}
<A>__{edna laughs. they start to make love. gently. below the undulating bedsprings rests a large chamberpot and, beside it, carter's shotgun. beyond is the bedroom door. it opens slowly and the two men enter. only their legs are visible.}
<C>__{con }
<D>__{put us in it, jack.}
<A>__{carter is off the bed, and edna, in a flash. edna screams and tries to stop the bedclothes following carter on to the floor. peter and con stand beside the bed smiling. peter is a queer and dressed fancy in a leather coat, wide bottomed trousers and a loud silk scarf. his hair is bleached blond. con is more traditional, more butch. he's in a camelhair overcoat, suit and tie. both are in their thirties.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{don't let us interrupt you, jack.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{i might have guessed.}
<C>__{con}
<D>__{sorry about this. but there you are. orders are orders.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{and what orders would they be, con?}
<A>__{carter's hand runs over the carpet. it's going towards the chamber pot instead of the gun.}
<C>__{con}
<D>__{gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we've got to take you back to london.}
<C>__{con}
<D>__{he said it'd be doing him a big favour.}
<A>__{carter's hand finds the chamber pot and quickly moves on towards the gun.}
<C>__{con}
<D>__{we know why you're all steamed up, and so do gerald and sid.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{but they have to be diplomatic.}
<A>__{carter pulls out the gun and jumps up.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{right. now take me back to london.}
<C>__{con}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{it'd be best if you got dressed first.}
<A>__{carter moves around the bed towards them. he's naked.}
<C>__{con}
<D>__{put it away, jack. you know you won't use it.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{the gun he means.}
<A>__{both men are laughing.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{out.}
<A>__{peter and con back down the stairs. peter looks up at carter's cock.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{if anna could see you now.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{out.}
<C>__{con}
<D>__{now, jack. be reasonable. you know we're going to take you back sooner or later.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{out.}
