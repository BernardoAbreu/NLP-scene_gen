<L>__{interior interrogation anteroom day}
<A>__{we look through a one way mirror into the interrogation room where detectives onderdonk and devenpeck are trying the bad cop bad cop routine on evelyn. isabel walks into frame and watches: onderdonk slams his fist on the table. davenpeck shouts in evelyn's face. evelyn just laughs. isabel shakes her head. frustrated and more exhausted than their detainee, the two detectives leave the interrogation room for the ante room where isabel is.}

<D>__{i'm sure. i only need a moment, then i will be out of your way.}
<A>__{they shrug. isabel goes into the room with evelyn. we stay with onderdonk and davenpeck, who watch her through the two way mirror. through the mirror: isabel walks right up to evelyn, smiles, and whispers one word to him her. evelyn's face freezes. he she looks at isabel, scared. then he she starts to weep. uncontrollably.... tears stream down his her face. isabel hands evelyn a sheet of paper and he she begins to write. onderdonk and davenpeck are dumbfounded. isabel turns around so she's facing them.}
