<L>__{interior country house drawing room night}
<A>__{jack and jani, giles, gordon and their two girlfriends are sitting down with drinks at a card table. gordon opens a fresh deck of cards.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't gamble.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{don't be a spoilsport. it's only a few quid.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's nothing to do with money. i don't gamble.}
<A>__{giles looks to jani to persuade him.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{he doesn't gamble.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will watch.}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(insinuatingly)}
<D>__{jack likes to watch.}
<P>__{(to jani)}
<D>__{does he like to watch?}
<A>__{jack is getting angry. jani is calm.}
<C>__{jani}
<P>__{(to gordon)}
<D>__{one more remark like that and i will break your balls.}
<A>__{there is silence. gordon is embarrassed. fiona looks at chloe, they're shocked and impressed. jack smiles.}
<C>__{giles}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i will bet she could, too.}
<A>__{jack defuses the atmosphere.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will deal, but i won't play.}
<A>__{he sits down, picks up the cards.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{you sure you know how?}
<A>__{jack takes the pack of cards, splits it expertly into two, shuffles by pressing the two halves together open palmed. there is a rattling noise as the cards fold mechanically into one another, leaving the pack as if it hadn't been shuffled. fiona and chloe are fascinated.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{do that again.}
<A>__{jack gives the cards to his right, gordon cuts them. another immaculate professional shuffle, and out come the cards from jack's right hand, flicking across the table. as the cards land, they fall exactly next to one another in front of each player.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{that's sexy.}
<A>__{at the end of the deal, five players are looking at a neat fan of five cards before them.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{don't they look pretty.}
<A>__{they all pick up their cards.}
<C>__{giles}
<P>__{(frowns)}
<D>__{there's nothing pretty about this hand.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{you're not supposed to talk, giles.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{he's probably lying. he does that.}
<A>__{jack catches jani's eye. she winks.}
