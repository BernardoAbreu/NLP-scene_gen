<D>__{i told you you might find it a bit disturbing.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i have found this whole day a bit disturbing.}
<A>__{arthur realizes he has his towel with him. he wipes his mouth with it, dabs his brow. then he notices... ...the room which is like a car dealer's showroom only instead of cars there are models of various planets.}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{did you know we built planets?}
<A>__{no. arthur didn't know that. he looks perplexed.}
<C>__{slartibartfast }
<D>__{fascinating trade. doing the coastlines was always my favorite. used to have endless fun doing all the little fiddly bits round fjords. but the galactic economy collapsed, and seeing that custom built planets are something of a luxury commodity...}
<P>__{(getting back on subject)}
<D>__{at any rate, there's been a terrible mix up with your planet. you must come with me or it's all going to blow up in our faces. the best laid plans of mice, you know...}

<D>__{...and men.}
<C>__{slartibartfast}

<D>__{the best laid plans of mice and men.}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{i don't think men have got much to do with it.}
<A>__{arthur looks confused. slarti motions him to a door. arthur readies his towel at his mouth as slarti hits a button. the door slides open and nothing happens. it's just a door that leads to a room where several transport carts move past like a kids ride at disneyland. they step into one. slarti closes the little door. the cart moves through a curtain, out into deep space. pull back till the cart is no more than a speck being pushed forward by the longest telescoping arm in history.}
