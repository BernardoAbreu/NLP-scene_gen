<A>__{the building covers almost an entire city block. anderson, dripping wet, runs from one end of it to another, blasting through doors, shoving terrified workers out of the way. he is like a wide receiver running the length of the field, jumping obstacles, slamming through, over, and around whatever he must to get to his goal. and then he reaches his goal the windows overlooking the avenue next block over and parallel to the one where precrime ambushed him. he spots a double decker turbotram moving slowly in the stream of traffic. it pulls to the curb below to pick up passengers. anderson blasts out the window and leaps onto the roof of the bus. it is a bone jarring landing. he loses consciousness for a second, rolls the length of the roof, and slides off it onto the pavement. he lies there, trying to rouse himself. traffic brakes to a stop automatically as car and truck sensors read his form in the road. no one wants to touch him. a single car horn sounds, and then a chorus of them. anderson rouses, struggles to his feet, and takes off in a limping run.}
