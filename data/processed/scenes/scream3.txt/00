<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i did. hon, although i got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{heh heh i bet they are babe. i bet they are. look, my battery's dying . . .}
<A>__{but of course, we notice ben's battery is fine, he's just trying to cut the conversation short.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{alright hon, talk to you when the lights go down.}
<A>__{ben smiles.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{sure thing.}
<A>__{ben hangs up. he reclines back in his seat. camera slowly pans out the windshield revealing the huge traffic pile up awaiting him. he's not going anywhere.}
<B>__{close on glove compartment.}
<A>__{ben opens the glove compartment. papers scatter out. ben reaches for a card. close on card a small white business card: 1 900 wet 4 cock ben smiles, begins to dial out when suddenly, ring ring! the cell comes to life in his hand.}

<C>__{ben}
<D>__{who is this?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{who is this? at this point we know who the caller is. it's the nightmarish deep voice we've all come to know and hate from the first two films. it's never sounded so evil. so sexy.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well what number are you trying to reach?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i think you got the wrong number, buddy.}

<C>__{voice}
<D>__{wait, wait. don't hang up.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{asshole, can't talk.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{but your voice sounds so familiar.}
<A>__{ben smiles.}
<C>__{ben}

<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(loves the praise)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{now let's see you act your way out of this one.}
<A>__{the voice seems to have changed tones. it now sounds a lot harsher, angrier if you will.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i mean, i'm standing right outside the ladies room door at the plaza theater. your girlfriend christine is in there. she's all alone. everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.}
<P>__{(laughs coldly)}
<D>__{i've got my knife.}
<A>__{note: at this point we intercut shots of the empty lobby and halls of the plaza theater. a pov shot standing outside the ladies room door.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(turning pale)}
<D>__{listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{more of a game really.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what kind of a game?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{you seem to be familiar with the stab movies. here's how we play. i ask you a question. you get it right, your girlfriend lives. you answer wrong, she dies.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i swear to god if you lay a finger on her i will fucking kill you!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{maybe so, but right now, we play the game. first question, your girlfriend's counting on you, name your girlfriend's character in stab 2?}
<A>__{ben groans. he bangs his head against the steering wheel, if only he'd have paid attention to christine he might have known this.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{come on. don't you know?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(hesitating)}
<D>__{it's cici! cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!}
<C>__{voice}

<C>__{ben}

<D>__{i swear to god if you lay one hand on her!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{no! you listen to me, if you're not where i want you in fifteen minutes i will hollow her out. do you understand?}
<A>__{in the b.g. we hear christine's horrific screaming. the killer hangs up. ben looks ahead, traffic is picking up. he puts the suv into gear, peels out the nearest opening, narrowly avoiding collision. his car screeches down the off ramp.}
