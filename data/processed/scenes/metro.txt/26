<C>__{korda}
<D>__{who is it?}
<C>__{baffert }
<D>__{it's lieutenant sam baffert from the san francisco police department.}
<A>__{a slight hesitation from korda. he glances around the apartment. for what reason, we don't know. maybe to make sure there's nothing incriminating around. he opens the door.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{what happened? is there a problem?}
<C>__{baffert}
<D>__{may i come in? i would just like to ask you a couple of questions.}
<A>__{korda steps aside and lets baffert enter. korda closes the door. baffert scans the place. not bad. he listens to the music. a smile grows on his face.}
<C>__{baffert}
<D>__{count basie?}
<A>__{korda smiles back. another jazz aficionada.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{duke ellington. "things ain't what they used to be", recorded july 30,}
<C>__{baffert}
<D>__{yeah... yeah... now i can hear it.}
<A>__{korda goes to the stereo, turns it down. duke ellington plays low.}
<C>__{baffert}
<D>__{where did you find an old recording like that?}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{used record shop down on turk street. i was in there looking for some robert johnson.}
<P>__{(searching for the name)}
<D>__{memories... memory lane or something...}
<C>__{baffert}
<D>__{i've got to stop in there... mr. korda, do you know frank antonucci?}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{you mean frank who owns the bakery down the street?}
<A>__{baffert smiles.}
<C>__{baffert}
<D>__{no, this is a different frank. this is a man who deals in jewelry. stolen jewelry usually. you wouldn't know anybody like that?}
<A>__{korda drifts to the other side of the room. takes a look out his front window...}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{nobody there. just the truck.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{i certainly wouldn't.}
<A>__{he says it as if the very idea disturbs him. he turns away from the window. baffert feigns a coughing spell.}
<C>__{baffert}
<D>__{could i please have a little water?}
<C>__{korda}
<P>__{(the perfect host)}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{korda heads toward the kitchen area. baffert uses this as an opportunity to drift around the room. do a little snooping.}
<C>__{baffert}
<D>__{the reason i'm asking you is because we arrested him with some stolen jewelry. it was traced to the robbery of a store down on polk street. he said he was fencing it for you.}
<A>__{baffert notices something in the trash can.}
<B>__{his pov}
