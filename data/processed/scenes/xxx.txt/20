<L>__{interior 91st floor night}
<A>__{this fancy office is empty for the night. the stairwell door opens and a platoon of security guards rushes in. they take up position in front of the elevator doors armed with billy clubs and tasers. ding! the elevator arrives and the door swings open. but there's nobody inside. one guard steps forward and suddenly a bicycle swings down from the ceiling, tagging him in the face. he falls back, tasering another guard. jacket man drops down onto his bike and pedals through the chaos before the guards know what hit them. there's a curvy piece of art in the room, some kind of modern art statue. jacket man rides up the artwork like a ramp and does a tabletop aerial over a divider. he hits the ground pedalling, the guards hot after him. jacket man enters a huge open room with a field of cubicles in the middle. he bunny hops onto a desk and slides to a stop. he tosses back his hood and we get a good look at him for the first time. he is xander cage. he's got a shaved head, bizarre tattoos all over his body and multiple piercings. he's lean and heavily cut, even dangerous looking. the guards charge at him and he hops up onto the top of the cubicle wall. this thing is maybe four inches wide and five}

<A>__{he pedals across the top of the cubicle wall, the guards scrambling after him. xander bunny hops over one guy's head onto the next set of cubicles and pedals hard. the guards fall all over themselves trying to catch him. at the other end xander catches air and lands on a conference table. he does a wheelie across it's length with guards closing in. xander springs up and does a tail whip, knocking them back with his rear wheel. he lands and pedals to the stairwell untouched.}
