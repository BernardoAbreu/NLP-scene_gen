<A>__{kirsty lifts a cloth off one of the boxes. staring up from the box is the corpse of prudhoe, his eyes and mouth open in a silent shriek. she reels back from the box, terrified, backing into the shadows. an arm reaches for her, taking hold of her and dragging her back into darkness as the door opens. frank stands on the theshold. his breath is thick. he shambles forward, but he doesn't see her. we cut : back to the shadows. kirsty's eyes are wild with terror. back to the door, which clicks closed. kirsty breaks cover, and so does her saviour. it's steve. he is sweating with terror.}
