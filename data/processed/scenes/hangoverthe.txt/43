<D>__{your negativity is like a little black cloud over our car, alan. you've got to let go of this.}

<A>__{alan looks off, lost, sick. vick stops the car short.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{alan. honey. have you considered, even for a second, that maybe the things we do when we're drunk are what we secretly want to do?}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(dripping with sarcasm)}
<D>__{yeah, no, you're absolutely right, vick, i've always secretly wanted to marry a bottle blonde with big fake melon tits named chastity!}

<D>__{i ain't mad atcha, dude...}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{or, after 14 years, maybe you don't have the balls to leave becky, and this is your way of getting her to leave you.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i was going to propose to her this weekend, you jackass!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{all the more reason to freak out.}

<C>__{vick }
<D>__{i love you, alan mervish, i do, but you've always had a major pole up your ass. maybe last night was your inner cool person trying to get out }
<C>__{alan}

<A>__{smash! a baseball bat shatters the windshield! the guys all jump! vick slams on the brakes!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{what the ?!}
<A>__{they look up to see two massive samoan men in loud hawaiian shirts, kalolo fanalua and kikiolani, 30's, standing on either side of the car. and they look pissed.}
<C>__{kalolo fanalua}
<D>__{get out of the car, vick.}
<A>__{stu and alan recoil in terror.}

<D>__{okay, okay! cool it with the bat! jesus, why is everyone trying to kill my car...?}
<A>__{vick undoes his seatbelt and reaches for his door handle. kikiolani lowers his bat and vick throws the door open, right into his nuts! the huge samoan staggers back, owww, and vick slams his door shut and floors it out of there in reverse! the caddy sideswipes a car, hops the curb, and lands on the street! they squeal away, the huge bronze shield flying out of the backseat as they do! it clatters on the pavement...}
