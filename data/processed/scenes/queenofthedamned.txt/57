<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior alley night}
<A>__{jesse hurries up the alley. breaks into a run. but the three punk vampires from the bar have somehow gotten outside. they land in front of her, beside her, behind her. heart racing, she shakes with fear. they close in, smiling.}
<D>__{punk vampire #3 now this isn't gonna hurt. you might even enjoy it...}
<A>__{he runs his hand up and down her body. jesse starts to shake. she breaks out in a cold sweat. the others grin. he picks her up by the throat. her legs flail in the air... suddenly, the two vampires turn and hiss like cats. jesse hits the flagstones hard with a grunt. she gasps for air, looks up as the vampires are hurled out of the alley by an invisible force. jesse alone, turns, still woozy. finds herself staring at... lestat... jesse's eyes open wide, entirely stunned. he drinks her in with his eyes, marking the soft paleness of her skin, her long, red hair, the flush on her cheeks, her pulsing jugular. jesse stares into his entrancing grey eyes, tries to gather herself together, half fearful, half titillated. they gaze at each other, the air suddenly electric.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{you saved me.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{perhaps... so you know marius...}
<A>__{jesse notices her rucksack cast aside by the punk vampires lestat's journal sticks out. she glances at lestat. he mustn't see it. she steps away, tries to distract him.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i know a lot of things.}
<A>__{he gazes at her. moves closer, breathing her in, making her flustered. he smiles.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{not how to stay alive apparently.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{well i guess we've got that in common. although i think i'm a little ahead in the race here.}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(a beat, surprised at her brazenness)}
<D>__{well, i can fix that.}
<A>__{he circles her. jesse is shaking, terrified. enjoying the game, lestat smiles, moves closer. but jesse suddenly blurts out.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{'mine eyes dazzle, she died so young.' it's about the girl with the violin, isn't it?}
<A>__{that stops lestat. he gazes at jesse, surprised. recovers his composure. stares at her intensely, regarding her anew.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{is it? and what else do you think you know?}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(desperate, stalling)}
<D>__{i... i think you're a lot like marius, lestat.}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(staring into her eyes, probing)}
<D>__{am i? tell me all about it.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{you're... you're both artists. he's a painter. you're a singer...}
<A>__{as she speaks, lestat guides jesse over to a pile of crates. she stares at some beer bottles shattered on the top of one. he guides her hand downward, closer to the shattered glass.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{is that so? what i do is art, is it?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{yes... from nothing... you try to create... something beautiful...}
<P>__{(shaking now as her}
<D>__{hand gets closer}
<P>__{and closer)}
<D>__{... out of the... the cold, dark wasteland of eternity...}
<A>__{he stares at her, the words oddly familiar, then scrapes her finger along the bits of broken glass, gravel. she gasps with pain... lestat gazes at the drops of blood that appear, glistening on jesse's finger...}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{something beautiful...}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{but... but marius isn't a rebel. you're different in that way. you don't want to hide, follow the laws, concealed in the shadows like some insect. you... you still want to walk with the living, don't you, lestat?}
<A>__{he stares into her eyes, slowly brings her bleeding finger toward his mouth.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{well, i'm not hiding now, am i?}
<A>__{as her bleeding thumb gets closer and closer to his mouth...}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{no, but the only time you're not really alone is when you kill... but, lestat, you can't help it... it's not your fault... he made you this way...}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(with her blood on}
<D>__{his lips, shakes}
<P>__{his head)}
<D>__{ah. poor, poor me...}
<A>__{as he brings her finger closer and closer to his mouth. their eyes bore into each other, he stares at her rosy cheeks, the cold sweat on her forehead, taking in her remarkable, if foolhardy daring. her eyes gazing straight into his... he brings her bleeding finger into his mouth. she may swoon. lestat's eyes burn as he tastes her for mortality, her fragility a brief second, listening to her blood. there's something there that surprises him as he gazes at this mortal girl. he feels something. desire... then her blood speaks to him as lestat's eyes fall on her rucksack. he sees the journal. it all falls into place. lestat's lip curls in anger. he shoves jesse away. wipes his mouth. the mood suddenly changes.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{well, talamascan, you're certainly a very clever librarian, aren't you?}
<A>__{she stares at him, found out. he turns from her, laughing, but not the kind of laugh to make jesse think all's well.}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{how sad, you people always trying to know the unknowable... so, was it a good read? my diary.}
<A>__{jesse slowly nods, admitting to all. he shakes his head.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{talamasca's been following me for years. i've never known one to be so brave. or is it just foolish?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i... i'm only an apprentice.}
<A>__{he waves her off, dismissive.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{go. i'm through with you. your kind never satisfies my thirst.}
<A>__{he turns, walks away. jesse lets out a sigh of relief, then stares after him. she hesitates, then suddenly calls out:}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{does anything, lestat?}
<A>__{a pause in his gait. but he keeps walking away. jesse hesitates again, but still calls out.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i mean, what's the point of coming into the light if not to have someone really know you?}
<A>__{but he keeps going. she takes one last chance }
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{you want the world to see you're real, don't you, lestat? don't you? well, here i am!}
<A>__{suddenly lestat spins. stares at the fragile mortal girl risking everything. flash. jesse gasps. he now stands right before her. he grabs her, pulls her to him close, tight, hard. he could just snap her neck and be done with it.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you better just stick to your books, talamascan. 'cause you have it all wrong. i love all this. i delight in it. the dark, dreary world i went to sleep in has burnt itself out and been replaced by the 20th century can you imagine my joy at waking up to discover such a world? it has outdistanced my wildest dreams of it. i scream of good and evil, and mortals stand and cheer. i adore being back in action... every moment, every single drop of it! now consider yourself exceedingly lucky and go!}
<A>__{he pushes her away. she gasps, humbled by his physical power. she retrieves her rucksack. starts away. as she reaches the end of the alley, she pauses, takes a breath, turns back, daring everything.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{lestat!}
<A>__{he turns back, stares at her, astonished.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{there's something you left out of your diary.}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(stares right into his eyes)}
<D>__{you kept her violin, didn't you?}
<A>__{a beat, then lestat shakes his head, laughs at the absurdity of what she's saying. but jesse is undaunted.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{hey, it's okay. i understand...}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{after all, it's only human.}
<A>__{that stops him. their eyes bore into each other again. electric. then lestat hisses at her, the inhuman sound filling the alley. lestat lunges, fangs bared. jesse screams. turns. runs. finds herself }
