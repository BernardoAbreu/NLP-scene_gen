<T>__{dissolve:}
<L>__{interior bank.}
<A>__{inside the bank. in contrast to the previous inept bank robbery scene, this one goes admirably well, the gang performing slickly and without a hitch. as they enter, dripping wet, clyde makes a general announcement to everyone to the bank.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{this is the barrow gang.}
<P>__{(the people turn and freeze)}
<D>__{everybody just take it easy and nobody will get hurt.}
<A>__{clyde covers the door. bonnie and buck go to the tellers' cages and get money. buck goes inside, emptying out the cash drawers. cut to bonnie filling the sack. cut to a close up of a burglar alarm button. slowly a hand crawls up the wall and a finger slowly moves to push the button. when the finger is about one inch away, suddenly a gun appears in the frame and gently taps the hand away. the camera pulls back to reveal buck smiling at a lady teller.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{don't do nothin' silly now.}
<A>__{cut to clyde standing near the door, training his guns on the entire bank. a farmer stands a few feet away, some bills clutched in his hand.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{that your money or the bank's?}
<C>__{farmer}
<D>__{mine.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{keep it, then.}
<A>__{across the floor, the bank guard in the corner takes advantage of clyde's distraction to go for his gun. clyde spots it and fires a shot that just knocks the bank guard's hat off without harming him.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(to the guard, who}
<D>__{has practically}
<P>__{frozen in fear)}
<D>__{next time i will aim a little lower.}
<A>__{they finish robbing the bank. they start to exit. near the door stands a guard with his hands raised. he wears sun glasses of the period. as they leave buck snatches the sun glasses from the guard's head.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{get a good look at us! we're the barrow boys.}
