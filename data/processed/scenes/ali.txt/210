<L>__{exterior ring we enter}
<A>__{they cheer. ali raises his hand and salutes them. ali dances from one end of the ring to the other...dances into george's corner... the crowd roars. another angle: ali dances back to his corner...}
<C>__{angelo dundee}
<D>__{george is playing prima donna. he wants to make you wait.}
<A>__{ali laughs. you won't psyche out muhammad ali with that stuff. instead, ali uses the time. he tests the ropes. he gets the feel of the distance between the center and the corner. closer: ali circles the ring. he looks at the crowd from different angles, from the corner, the center... he looks up at the lights and gets used to the heat from them. ali's feet do a shuffle. he feels the canvas. he feels the soft spots. the firm spots. he feels how much slide there is because of the resin on the canvas, how much spring there is in the boards...}
<B>__{ali}
<A>__{sheds his robe, now, and throws a blistering array of jabs and hooks. the crowd goes nuts. ali looks ringside and sees... ali's pov: jim brown lloyd price...further along...robert lipsyte.}
