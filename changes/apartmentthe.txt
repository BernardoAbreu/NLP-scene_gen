He pours the contents into a glass, plops the lone olive out of the jar, scoops up the last handful of potato chips, toasts an imaginary companion, and drinks up.

In the bathroom, Bud, in pajamas by now, is brushing his teeth.  From the shower rod hang three pairs of socks on stretchers.  Bud takes a vial from the medicine shelf, shakes out a sleeping pill, washes it down with a glass of water.  He turns the light off, walks into the bedroom. In the bedroom, the single bed is made, and the lamp on the night table is on.  Bud plugs in the electric blanket, turns the dial on.  Then he climbs into bed, props up the pillow behind him.  From the night table, he picks up the magazine that arrived in the mail, slides it out of the wrapper, opens it.  It's the new issue of PLAYBOY.  Bud leafs through it till he comes to the piece de resistance of the magazine. He unfolds the overleaf, glances at it casually, refolds it, then turns to the back of the magazine and starts to read. What he is so avidly interested in is the men's fashion section.  There is a layout titled WHAT THE YOUNG EXECUTIVE WILL WEAR with a sub-head reading The Bowler is Back. Illustrating the article are several photographs of male models wearing various styles of bowlers. Bud is definitely in the market for a bowler, but somehow his mind starts wandering.  He turns back to the overleaf again, unfolds it, studies it, then holds the magazine up vertically to get a different perspective on the subject. By now the sleeping pill is beginning to take effect, and he yawns.  He drops the magazine on the floor, kills the light, settles down to sleep.  The room is dark except for the glow from the dial of the electric blanket. Three seconds.  Then the phone jangles shrilly in the living room.  Bud stumbles groggily out of bed, and putting on his slippers, makes his way into the living room.  He switches on the light, picks up the phone.}

There are men with gaily wrapped packages, small trussed-up Christmas trees, a plucked turkey in a plastic bag. Written across the mirror behind the bar, in glittering white letters, is HAPPY HOLIDAYS. Everybody is in high spirits, laughing it up and toasting each other. Everybody except Bud Baxter. He is standing at the bar in his chesterfield and bowler, slightly isolated, brooding over an almost empty martini glass. The bartender comes up, sets down a fresh martini with an olive on a toothpick, takes his payment from a pile of bills and coins lying in front of Bud. Bud fishes out the olive, adds it to half a dozen other impaled olives neatly arranged in fan shape on the counter. He is obviously trying to complete the circle. A short, rotund man dressed as Santa Claus hurries in from the street, and comes up to the bar beside Bud.}

Her name is MARGIE MacDOUGALL, she is drinking a Rum Collins through a straw, and she too is alone. From a distance, she is studying Bud with interest. On the bar in front of her is a container of straws in paper wrappers. She takes one of them out, tears off the end of the paper, blows through the straw -- sending the wrapper floating toward Bud. The paper wrapper passes right in front of Bud's nose. He doesn't notice it. Margie, undaunted, lets go with another missile. This time the wrapper lands on the brim of Bud's bowler. No reaction. Another wrapper comes floating in, hits Bud's cheek. He never takes his eye off his martini. Margie leaves her place, and carrying her handbag and her empty glass, comes up alongside Bud.
