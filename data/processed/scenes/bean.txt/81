<D>__{thanks man, i can't tell you how much i appreciate talking to ya. in this job you get so many jerks spilling their guts all over ya, with their stupid problems ... but you, you're a great listener, ya know that?}
<A>__{bean smiles politely. taxi drives away. bean walks up to' the front porch, checks the house number on his piece of paper and presses the doorbell. no answer. presses again. still no answer ... now where have they hidden the key. he inspects things carefully. the camera sees what he sees ... the doormat, the flowerpot, the window ledge ... and then he spots a little stone frog. bean smiles. key hiding is something he knows about and people are pathetically obvious about it. bean picks up the frog to reveal the front door key. it glints in the porch light.}
