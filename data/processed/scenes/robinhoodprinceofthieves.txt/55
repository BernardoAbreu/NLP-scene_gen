<L>__{exterior forest pool day}
<A>__{water, sparkling with sunlight. bursts, as robin dives in naked. he luxuriates in the cool water... hoofbeats. he attempts to hide... too late. four horses emerge from the trees. bull and hal, with marian and her servant sarah sandwiched between them. bull has a black eye. marian jumps down.}
<C>__{marian}
<P>__{(to robin)}
<D>__{how dare you!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{good morning, lady marian.}
<A>__{in response, she starts pelting him with stones.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{you send men to drag me from my home in the middle of the night, like some slave girl? is this the way the famous robin hood treats a lady?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{ah well... er, let me finish this bath you wished me to take. then i will explain.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{i demand an explanation right now!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{if you will be patient, i could spare your propriety by...}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{i will decide when my propriety is compromised.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{as you wish.}
<A>__{he wades bare ass naked out of the water towards her. she casts a contemptuous look over his muscled body, glistening with water.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{how dare you expose yourself to me?!}
<A>__{she slugs him. robin stumbles backwards into the water. bull grins, gesturing to sarah and pointing to his own black eye.}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{the big 'un did the same to me.}
