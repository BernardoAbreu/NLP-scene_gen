<A>__{david enters his hotel room. the silence contrasts starkly with the noisy energy of the campaign trail. he turns on the tv. scrolls through the channels. after a moment shuts it off. total silence again. it bothers him. he opens up his briefcase. pulls out a thick file his itinerary for the next three days. dozens of speeches and meetings across the state. he glances at the summary page on the top. glances down the page with his finger, stopping, almost at random, on a speech he's giving two days from now at the westchester county open space initiative.}

<A>__{his ability to retain this sort of information is stunning. he doesn't need to review. it's already all there. he closes his itinerary file. goes to the window and looks out at the trees. the silence back...it's deafening.}
