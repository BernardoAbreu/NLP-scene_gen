<L>__{interior hangar day}
<A>__{the lockheed electra, a sleek state of the art aircraft with its gleaming metallic surface, nose up in the center of a huge space. its engines are on hoists, being worked on by a team of mechanics. eight year old gore gazes up, as if he has never seen anything quite so wondrous. amelia and gene watch, with barely suppressed smiles. he's in a suit. she's in grease stained overalls from working with the mechanics.}
<C>__{gore}
<D>__{so you'd be the first one, right? you always like that.}
<A>__{first one?}
<P>__{gore (cont’d)}
<D>__{to fly around the world.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{well, there's magellan, 400 years ago. actually, he didn't make it. and he died. and he used a boat.}
<C>__{gore}
<D>__{so it's almost the same, except it's completely different.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{pretty much.}
<A>__{he glowers at her. she glowers back.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{there are men who say they flew around the world, but they didn't fly around all of it.}
<C>__{gore}
<D>__{because at higher latitudes, it's a short trip. at the north pole, you just spin in a circle and you've gone around the world.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{so why are you asking? just to show how smart you are?}
<C>__{gore}
<D>__{pretty much.}
<A>__{now he's grinning. she just glowers harder.}
<P>__{gore (cont’d)}
<D>__{the only way to really fly around the world is to fly the entire circumference of 27,000 miles. like at the equator.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{no one's tried it. you think i should?}
<A>__{no answer.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{dare me.}
<C>__{gore}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{is she serious? she seems to be.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{ask her about the pacific. the maximum range of the electra is 4000 miles. and the closest land west of honolulu is farther than that.}
<A>__{gore looks to her. well?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i will have to refuel.}
<C>__{gore}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{in the air. one plane to another.}
<A>__{the boy is staring at her now. staring.}
<C>__{gore}
<D>__{you're really going to do all this, aren't you?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{well, don't you think i can?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{gore}
<D>__{i guess we'll find out.}
<A>__{another.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{pretty much.}
<A>__{hold on gene. he smiles at his kid...}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{go out to the car and get sara. ask if she'll take you for an ice cream. okay?}
<A>__{the boy knows he's being dismissed. looks from his dad to amelia, who steps forward to give him a hug and a kiss.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{we'll play some cards before you leave.}
<A>__{okay, then. he waves. one more glance at dad, and gore goes. gene gestures for amelia to come with him, away from the mechanics. what's up? but he's already walking to... ...a little folding table, off in a corner. she follows. sits. well...?}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{you can't refuel in the air.}
<A>__{just like that.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{is that an opinion or an order?}
<A>__{his rueful smile.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{the only good thing about losing our former relationship is i feel a little freer to tell you when you’re being completely crazy.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{oh, i bet there are more advantages than just that.}
<A>__{no one’s backing down on this.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{you're not a good enough pilot to do mid air refueling. you will not be able to control the electra for that docking maneuver for that amount of time.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i've taken bigger risks.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{i've noticed. don't be so proud of it.}
<A>__{he reaches into a pocket. pulls out a folded sheet of paper. it opens to reveal a map of the pacific. a dot is circled in red.}
<P>__{gene (cont’d)}
<D>__{this is howland island. it's half way between honolulu and new guinea. it has no elevation, no trees, it's a mile wide and a mile and a half long. hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{it's your vacation home.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{we’re colonizing it, because when the japanese make their move, we're going to need a refueling strip there.}
<A>__{she blinks. the japanese.}
<P>__{gene (cont’d)}
<D>__{try reading the newspapers between the lines. we haven't started building the runways yet. maybe if someone i knew could get the president's attention...}
<A>__{she stares at the map. the dot.}
<P>__{gene (cont’d)}
<D>__{it's really tiny, a grain of sand in the middle of a thousand miles of nowhere.}
<A>__{her eyes are clicking through a calculus of their own.}
<P>__{gene (cont’d)}
<D>__{you'd need a first class navigator for that leg. which means the trip can't be entirely solo.}
<A>__{and softly...}
<P>__{gene (cont’d)}
<D>__{can you handle that?}
<A>__{no answer. he waits without saying a word.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{don't rush me. i'm thinking.}
