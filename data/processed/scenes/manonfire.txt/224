<A>__{creasy steps into courtyard, turns, a vw bug coming right at him... aims his weapon.}
<B>__{the man}
<A>__{ducks down... windshield shatters from the blast of creasy's shotgun... bug slams into wall. the man rolls out... using the door as a shield.}
<B>__{barrio}
<A>__{the man flees into a labyrinth of packing crate houses on car tire foundations out into street. running hard, too hard for creasy in his condition. he is losing a lot of blood. he stops.}
<B>__{creasy}
<A>__{behind the wheel of the volkswagon, roars out chasing. now through the maze of poverty... creasy drives hard... no sign of the man... empty eyes of poverty looking back... mostly women and children... they clearly see creasy... fully exposed... driving a car with no windshield... he slams the car into reverse. someone says "creasy" aloud... now more faces to turn... children looking directly through his absent windshield. one skinny kid runs ahead of creasy. the boy points at one cardboard house propped up against a brick and stucco wall.}
