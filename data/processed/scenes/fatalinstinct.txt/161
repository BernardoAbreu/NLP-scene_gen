<A>__{as ned and lola continue their violent struggle... lola grabs toiletries to aid in her attack. she squirts ned with shaving cream... squeezes toothpaste in his hair... and throws bath powder in his face! ned is blinded. gaining the advantage, lola shoves him back, slamming his head into the wall. he's dazed, helpless. lola raises the ice pick, moving forward to strike! but ned grabs a hair blower and swings it around, pointing it at her like a gun! she freezes... then smiles contemptuously.}

<D>__{what're you gonna do, ned? blow me away?}
<A>__{she laughs arrogantly. ned clicks on the hair blower to high, a blast of hot air hitting lola's face, puffing her cheeks out, pushing her back, hair flying wildly! her backside hits the railing where lana has cut it... the wood splintering! lola tumbles over backward, screaming! she hangs suspended in mid air for a moment, like a cartoon character, arms flailing. then... whoom!... she falls to the marble floor below, hitting with a loud thud!}
