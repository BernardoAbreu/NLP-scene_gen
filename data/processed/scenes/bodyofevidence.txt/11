<L>__{interior conference room day}
<A>__{rebecca is seated at the end of the conference table smoking a cigarette. sunlight flows through a window and highlights her hair. she is dressed in a fashionable business suit that clings to every curve of her body. dulaney enters the room. when he sees her he can't help but stare. rebecca notes his gaze.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{miss lawson, i'm frank dulaney.}
<A>__{she raises the cigarette to her lips. dulaney notices despite her outward composure her hand is shaking.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{are you going to represent me?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{there are no charges against you. i'm here to decide if i'm going to represent you should that occur.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{did you kill him?}
<A>__{rebecca appears hurt by the question.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{you don't waste any time, do you?}
<A>__{dulaney doesn't answer. he studies her his eyes probing hers.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{do you think i did it?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i don't know. that's why i'm asking you.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{you must have some feeling. some immediate impression. a young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will. and the things that went on in that house. such wild sex. what kind of picture does that paint?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{not a very good one i'm afraid.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{and that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me. that's why i need a very good lawyer, mr. dulaney.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you're assuming the district attorney is going to file charges.}
<A>__{rebecca's anxiety begins to surface. she feigns a weak smile.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{he'll file. he's an ambitious man. ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you still haven't answered my question.}
<A>__{she takes a long drag of her cigarette before answering. she looks at dulaney. displaying emotions is not something that comes easily. tears well up in her eyes.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(emotionally)}
<D>__{i loved him. a big part of my life has been torn away from me, mr. dulaney. a part i can never get back and on top of that people are saying that i am somehow responsible for it. they've taken everything that is good and caring about two people in love and made it dirty.}
<A>__{a single tear streams down her check. she knows what he wants to hear her say and she resents having to say it.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{no i didn't kill him.}
