<A>__{the boulevard is empty, eerie silence. no cars, no people. a man walks down the middle of the street, long trench, dark shades. though he does not speak, we hear...}
<C>__{man v.o.}
<D>__{there's two kinds of people in this world when you boil it all down. you got your talkers and you got your doers.}
<A>__{we recognize this man as rocco. he crosses copley square toward the looming dome of the trinity church.}
<C>__{rocco v.o.}
<D>__{most people are just talkers. all they got is talk. but when all's said and done, it is the doers who change the world. and when they do that, they change us. that's why we never forget them...so, which one are you? do you just talk about it? or do you stand up and do something about it? because believe you me all the rest of it is just coffee house bullshit.}
