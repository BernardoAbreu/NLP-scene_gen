<A>__{bob picks up the gun.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{how many bullets can that hold?}

<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{bob.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i'm paying attention. i just want to look at it for a minute.}
<C>__{dignan}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{what's your fucking problem? you're a shithead!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i just want to see how much bullets it takes.}
<A>__{anthony picks up the gun off the table. he clicks the action.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{anthony, give me the fucking gun!}
<C>__{anthony}
<P>__{(pulling away)}
<D>__{no, dignan. it's not your gun. it's all of ours.}
