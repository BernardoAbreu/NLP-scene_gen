<A>__{the guards start blasting the empty moving car. they manage to shoot out the headlights, while bond is having trouble coordinating driving and shooting at the same time. as bullets rip up the newspapers in front of them }

<A>__{sidney starts to shoot as the guards continue to blast away at the car... but: the windows don't shatter. the armor plated side panels only dent with bullet hits... the tires don't go flat. there's chaos; a cacophony of voices and wild gunfire as bond steers the car to their position, where the door opens automatically.}

<D>__{ready? now!}
<A>__{the two of them make a break for the car, diving inside.}
