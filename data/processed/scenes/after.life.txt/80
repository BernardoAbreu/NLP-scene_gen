<L>__{interior jack's house. bedroom night}
<A>__{jack lies in bed staring at the ceiling. on his bedside table an alarm clock reads 2.38am. he looks across at an anglepoise lamp in the corner of the room bent over an open shoebox. he gets up. walks towards the muted light. the small chick huddles in the shoebox. it looks dead even though it's eyes are open. jack's about to reach into the box. then changes his mind. he looks at the lamp. switches it off. after a moment he switches it back on again.}
