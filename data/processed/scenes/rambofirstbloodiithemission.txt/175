<A>__{is knocked down as a grenade detonates near him. a trooper helps him up, sees a figure running nearby... fires. hitting one of their own. more grenades. random firing. the din is incredible, the pandemonium absolute. a viet soldier, reels through the grass. obviously a recent conscript, the soldier is probably only 18 years old, and like all vietnamese, looks even younger. he is terrified. he stumbles over the body of another trooper. as he rises, a shape slashes through the grass right in front of him. he has never seen an american, but it looks as monstrous as the descriptions. he raises his ak but rambo is quicker, kicking it out of his hands. the kid flops on his butt and finds himself staring up rambo's rifle barrel. he closes his eyes and pops into his mouth his buddhist prayer medallion, hanging from a chain around his neck. he bites down and waits for oblivion. when he opens his eyes there is nothing in front of him but grass. nearby, vinh leads the retreat as his men fall back, dim shapes rushing blindly through the murk. he staggers, coughing, out of the stand of grass to see tay, sitting dazed nearby. tay gives him an evil smirk. barking orders like a maniac, vinh calls for mortars to be set up. five mortars are positioned. elevation set. mortar bombs poised above the launch tubes. the helicopters clear off. when the last wounded man is dragged clear, vinh signals for a sighting round. it explodes beyond the wall of flame. the mortars open fire. the field explodes seconds later with the first salvo. earth and shredded grass are hurled skyward. a second salvo lands. a third. and on and on, pulverizing the entire area.}
