<L>__{interior outer security room day}
<A>__{janice sits at the non descript desk like a receptionist... but she is a highly trained security specialist. she is also hefty through the shoulders, aggressively unattractive and utterly humorless. she watches them on a monitor screen as they stand outside the door. harry and gib appear as living x ray images. their weapons are visible in their shoulder harnesses. janice puts one hand automatically on the butt of a .45 tucked in a holster riveted beneath her desk. she buzzes harry and gib in with the other.}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{gentlemen, please idenitify yourselves to the scanner.}
<A>__{harry and gib step up to the combination retinal thumbprint voice scanners. harry presses his thumb against a black glass plate for laser scan, and looks into the eye piece of the retinal scanner.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{harry tasker. one zero zero two four.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{albert gibson. three four nine nine one.}
<A>__{their clearance appears on a monitor on janice's desk.}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{thank you. you are cleared.}
<A>__{she stands to give them plastic i.d. badges which they hang around their necks.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{ten, mr. gibson.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{and you still reach for your piece every time.}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{god! you have no idea how much that turns me on. i've never had the courage to say this before but... i love you, janice.}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{he kisses her wetly on the cheek as he goes by. she does not react is any discernible way. they pass through a heavy stainless steel door which opens automatically. beyond is a kind of airlock... a sally port. behind a lexan shield are two guards armed with mp5s. they nod but do not speak at harry and gib pass them.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you better watch it. she might file on you for sexual harassment.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{in her dreams.}
