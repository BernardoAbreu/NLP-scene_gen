<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior. fourteenth street and first avenue}
<A>__{we look down at the subway kiosk as our sad little party of three comes up the stairs to the sidewalk. it is midnight, and the street is occasionally patrolled by a taxicab. the sidewalks are pretty empty, just a few people walking. perhaps a drugstore is still open, and its lonely lit store front catches the eye. our three men stand at the head of the stairs at the subway kiosk, drained, tired, a little despondent. charlie looks up at the dim silhouettes of the endless apartment houses of stuyvesant town.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's where i live.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{which one?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{in the back there. you can't see it from here.}
<A>__{long shot of stuyvesant town as seen from their point of view. pan slowly across, capturing the silent monotony of the dark buildings. only a few of the windows are still lit.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{it looks like a state hospital.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it looks like a prison.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yeah, it does look a little like a prison.}
<A>__{the three men just stand, worn out, tired.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{i'm going home.}
<A>__{he starts to walk to the buildings, across the little street that separates the corner of fourteenth street and first avenue from the parallel corner of the housing project.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(calling after him)}
<D>__{hey, charlie ...}
<A>__{charlie turns.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{hey, charlie! what about the money? have you got ten bucks?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{all right, if you want to walk me to the house, i will get you ten bucks.}
<A>__{eddie has to take a moment to consider this. then he shuffles across the little street toward charlie. charlie doesn't quite wait for him to catch up when he turns and leads the way between two cars and up the sidewalk toward the promenade that leads to the heart of the project. arnold, after a moment, follows eddie. the three men disappear single file into the darkness of stuyvesant town.}
