<C>__{stu}
<D>__{hello? anybody? am i dead?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{please. i'd like to know if i'm dead.}
<A>__{off in the fog is a big wheeled cart with the sign: "psychological baggage claim." there stu finds two suitcases and a backpack. he examines the tags. they all belong to him! he sits on the edge of the cart, opens a suitcase, and pulls out... a bagged copy of marvel comics' conan the barbarian #1; an 8mm reel of highlights from ray harryhausen's jason and the argonauts, with swordfighting skeletons on the box cover; a spiral notebook, its cover labelled "stu m. geography," its inside pages covered with drawings of dinosaurs and airplanes; transparent plastic models of "the visible man" and his mate, "the visible woman," with a couple of spare organs that young stu never quite found a place for; a vinyl lp of "bread's greatest hits," which stu quickly slips back into the suitcase lest anyone see it. as he gathers his bags, he hears odd squeaks and chittering...}
<C>__{raccoon }
<D>__{carry your bags, mister?}
<A>__{a strange furry creature pops out from beneath the platform and yanks on stu's pants leg. it looks like a raccoon, but it's flat an animated pelt. before stu has time to let out a yell, a flat snakeskin comes slithering out from beneath the baggage cart...}

<D>__{cigars, mister? genuine coobans!}
<A>__{stu looks down and sees a squashed rabbit humping his leg.}
<C>__{rabbit}
<D>__{wanna meet my sister?}
