<A>__{a shabby apartment hotel on wilshire. an exterior hall balcony on each floor has the entrance doors to the front apartments. roy's honda makes the turn and enters the basement garage.}
<L>__{interior madero lobby day}
<A>__{modest but clean. the owner, simms, a sloppy garrulous old bore, talks with a potential renter.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{put it this way, now. say i rent to a woman, well, she has to have a room with a bath. i insist on it, because otherwise she's got the hall bath tied up all the time, washing her goddamn hair and her clothes and everything she can think of.}
<A>__{in b.g., roy, still in pain, comes out of the elevator, waves to simms, who waves back without pausing in his monologue, and crosses to the mailboxes.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{now, your minimum for a room with bath is three hundred a month, just for a place to sleep and no cooking allowed. and just how many of these tootsies make that kind of money and have to eat in restaurants and buy clothes and }
<A>__{roy, carrying his junk mail and pretending not to be in pain, crosses to simms.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{mr. simms.}

<D>__{uh huh. mrs. langtry may drop by.}
<A>__{simms doesn't like mrs. langtry, but can't say so.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i will send her right up.}
<A>__{roy goes back to the elevator. simms continues his monologue.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i had my first hotel thirty seven years ago in wichita falls, texas, and that's where i began to learn about women. they just don't make the money, you see, not regular they don't, and there's only one way they can get it.}
<A>__{roy enters the elevator.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{now, that mr. dillon there, that's the fine type of person i have in mind for here. like yourself, i have no doubt. he's a salesman, regular as clockwork, has a suite here. fine man. now, about these women. at first, you know, they just go out and do it now and then, just enough to make ends meet. but pretty soon they got that bank open twenty four hours a day, and then you've got trouble. hookers and hotellin' just don't mix. you'd think the cops'd be too busy catching real criminals, not snooping around after working girls, but that's the way the gravy stains, as the saying is, and i don't fight it. an ounce of prevention is my motto.}
<A>__{myra enters from the front, looks across at simms, points upward. simms calls to her.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{oh, yes, mrs. langtry, he's up there, he's expecting you.}
<A>__{myra crosses to the elevator. simms speaks more softly.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{if you keep out the women in the first place, see, you keep out the hookers, and then you keep out the cops, and that's how you have a clean place.}
