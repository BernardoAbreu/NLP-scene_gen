<L>__{exterior high ceiling bungalow n night}
<A>__{from the protection of the doorjamb, a very young uniformed policeman is the person shining the flashlight into the house. he's flanked on either side of the door by detective atwood and detective snyder. the officer's flashlight illuminates a short entryway with a hall immediately off to the left and the living room fading into darkness, straight ahead.}
<C>__{uniformed policeman}
<P>__{(continues)}
<D>__{we have a warrant to search your home and premises. we're coming in.}
<A>__{flashlight in her left hand and the glock in her right, detective atwood is the first one across the threshold. she directs the beam at the wall next to the door; finds the light switch. click! click! click.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{lights don't work.}
<A>__{she continues to the hall. the darkness is so oppressive there, it seems that her stream of light must struggle to pierce it. the room at the end is the kitchen. with snyder hanging in the entryway to protect her back, atwood eases the hand with the flashlight around the corner. the dishwasher, the sink, the cabinets gleam dully back at her. she steps inside. a debris field of empty pharmaceutical boxes and vials trails away from the refrigerator. her flashlight sweeps the rest of the room. beyond an open countertop in the dining area, the light blurs past an oval of white, and then comes back. it's the face of a woman!! careful of the litter, atwood moves forward until she can see that the woman is sitting in a chair at the far end of the dining table. her throat has been cut. her head is being held upright by her hair which is taped to the back of the chair. she has a pen taped between her fingers, but the appointment book in front of her is drenched in blood.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<P>__{(calls to the darkness in back of her)}
<D>__{we have a dead woman in here.}
<A>__{a light and footsteps hurry toward her from the living room. atwood swings her light at them.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{he squints and turns away.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{i thought you were behind me.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{the living room is clean.}
<A>__{atwood swings her light back onto the dead woman. the combined illumination of the flashlights cause the support joists twelve feet up to throw eerie shadows onto the open ceiling.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{snyder, meet mona.}
<A>__{the uniformed policeman comes up beside atwood.}
<C>__{uniformed policeman}
<D>__{i called it in.}
<A>__{the smell of blood and the sight of the carnage is too much for him. his gorge rises and he gags.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{do that outside.}
<A>__{the officer doesn't have to be told twice.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<P>__{(to snyder, re: the body)}
<D>__{meeks did this.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{i thought meeks hung people.}
<A>__{atwood retraces her steps in the kitchen.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{meeks is a steroid freak. this refrigerator was always full of steroids. mona was alvin griffin's niece, receptionist, lover and keeper of the keys.}
<A>__{she focuses her flashlight on an open padlock dangling from a steel band that runs around the refrigerator. with the barrel of the glock she opens the door. the only edibles inside are a tomato, half a loaf of bread, a package of hotdogs and some part of a chicken in a kfc box. the rest of the space is vacant.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{well, the steroids are certainly gone.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{you think meeks has alvin with him?}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{meeks thinks alvin turned him in.}
<A>__{she shuts the refrigerator.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{let's go see what's in the rest of the house.}
