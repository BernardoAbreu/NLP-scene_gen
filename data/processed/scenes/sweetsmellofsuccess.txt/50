<A>__{sidney comes closer to her. he puts his hand on the nape of her neck, carrassing her. under his touch, the girl is unhappy, and yet at the same time, responsive. sidney still has power over her but she is disturbed by feelings of shame. feeling her relaxed, sidney bends and kisses her on the side of the throat with more than negligence, for something about her always excites him; his aggression tune in with her submissiveness.}

<P>__{(exhilarated)}
<D>__{you see? hunsecker's gotta phone me!}
<A>__{he goes into the bedroom, closing the door as he goes. sally looks at the closed door.}
