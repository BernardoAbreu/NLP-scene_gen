<L>__{ext anne frank house later}
<A>__{lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{i'm afraid there's no elevator.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{oh, um, that's alright.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{no, there are many stairs. steep stairs.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i can do it.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hazel }
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i can do it!}
<A>__{hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments today. they are going inside. cut to:}
<L>__{int anne frank house ground floor moments later}
<A>__{a video plays on a monitor showing the nazi invasion of holland. hazel and gus stand with lidewij in a pack of backpackers and travelers about to take the tour. many of them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{shall we?}
<A>__{hazel nods. both hazel and gus walk slowly up the stairs. so far so good. they find themselves in an office space.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{this is the bookcase that hid the frank family and four others.}
<A>__{the bookcase is half open. behind it is an even steeper set of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time. some of the travelers begin to walk up the stairs. gus looks at hazel are you sure we should continue? she begins the climb, determined. lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen tank. hazel moves very slowly. we are aware of her labored breathing the entire time. angle on other tourists, watching and quietly commenting. just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages. hazel arrives on the next floor an empty room. she's definitely starting to struggle. she leans against the wall to catch her breath. gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you're a champion.}
<A>__{hazel smiles. when she's feeling up to it they walk into the next room, also empty. and another staircase, even more narrow and steep practically a ladder. when gus sees this he looks at hazel:}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{that's enough }
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(resolute)}
<D>__{i'm ok.}
<A>__{hazel very slowly begins the climb. again we're aware of her every breath. it's dark. and it's becoming very difficult. near the top hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull herself through. once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the wall, trying to catch her breath. gus crouches next to her.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{we're at the top. that's it.}
<A>__{hazel becomes aware that tourists look at her with concern. she smiles, stands up, nothing to see here. and now they're in the final room a long, narrow hallway. this is where anne frank and 7 other people lived in hiding for as long as they could. there's a time line detailing their story.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{the only member of the whole family to survive was otto, anne's father.}
<A>__{gus takes hazel's hand.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{i don't know how you go on, without your family.}
<A>__{lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. gus leads hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a video details the last days of anne frank's life. over it, we hear a young girl's voice reading from the diary. the travelers stand to watch and listen. gus and hazel do the same. the room is dark.}
<C>__{girl's voice }
<D>__{"at such moment's, i don't think about the misery..."}
<A>__{gus and hazel stand very closely together. the video is the cherry on top of a very emotional day. hazel watches it.}
<C>__{girl's voice }
<D>__{"...but about the beauty that still remains."}
<A>__{gus, meanwhile, is just watching hazel, the same way she watched him on the airplane. after a beat, she catches him. their eyes meet. the emotions build...}
<C>__{girl's voice }
<D>__{"try to recapture the happiness within yourself. think of all the beauty in everything around you... and be happy."}
<A>__{and hazel kisses gus. a most passionate, intense, you and me against the world kind of kiss, better than any they've experienced or could even imagine. it seems to last for a small eternity. eventually, they break away and open their eyes. they quickly notice all the travelers staring at them. for a brief second, they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do... when suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the whole thing. one european even shouts "bravo!" hazel blushes, gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. cut to:}
