<A>__{... walter? walter grabs for a water fountain, misses, suddenly collapses.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{your vial where's your pills, walter? walter finds the vial, pops it, his chest heaves and the pills spill on the floor. walter looks wide eyed up at brandon, mouths "big one." brandon frantically loosens walter's shirt. a crowd gathers. a businessman pulls a cell phone, dials 911.}
