<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior caves}
<A>__{squawking ominously, crows burst from the trees. robin rides up the path to the caves that his father took. checks the ground. horse tracks. he dismounts, moves cautiously forward. pov through scope circle of stones no one visible. debris. smoke rises from ashes. remnants of a recent ceremony.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{robin climbs silently down the rocks into the stone circle. there is blood on the sacrificial altar. through the opening of the cave, he spies a woman's form, lying face down.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{marian!}
<A>__{he runs forward. turns the body over. skin chalk white from loss of blood... sarah! a shadow falls across robin. before he can react, a cudgel stuns him into blackness.}
