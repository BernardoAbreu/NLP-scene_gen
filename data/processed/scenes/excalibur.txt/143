<L>__{exterior gate, inside and outside camelot day}
<A>__{the drawbridge lowers slowly, and arthur moves away from kay and the other knights, and advances across it. rooks wheel over the dead trees of the forest that surrounds camelot. a group of armed men waits at the edge of the forest. one steps forward, a huge knight in black armor, the metal defining and exaggerating the powerful musculature of his body. he is mordred, a young man of eighteen, and of extraordinary beauty. a page follows ten steps behind him bearing an enormous spear, its points hooded. arthur stops at the edge of the drawbridge, the huge knight a few steps from him. kay, ready for anything, moves halfway across the drawbridge. mordred kneels on one knee.}
<C>__{mordred}
<D>__{father...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{rise, mordred.}
<C>__{mordred}
<D>__{i have come to claim what is mine, father.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i recognize you only as my son, no more.}
<C>__{mordred}
<P>__{(his tone is scathing)}
<D>__{and you are the great king? the lords have rebelled. invaders attack the coasts. crops don't grow. there is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. only i am feared. i will be king. you may have lost excalibur, but i have found my own weapon of power. there.}
<A>__{he points to the huge lance. the page pulls a string and the hood drops, revealing a diabolically sharp spear tip, its metal glinting menacingly.}
<C>__{mordred}
<D>__{the very spear that pierced the side of christ as he died on the cross.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{your mother told you that?}
<A>__{mordred is thrown off by the doubt arthur has cast. arthur looks upon his son, desperately trying to read him.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i cannot offer you the land, only my love...}
<C>__{mordred}
<D>__{and i offer only this, father. to commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.}
<A>__{arthur goes forward to embrace his son, a desperate attempt. mordred recoils.}
<C>__{mordred}
<D>__{we will embrace only in battle. father, and i will touch you only with the blade of my spear.}
<A>__{arthur is on the verge of tears.}
<C>__{mordred}
<D>__{i will muster a great force of knights, and i will return to fight for what is mine.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so be it.}
<A>__{he turns and re enters the castle, the drawbridge pulled up immediately behind him. he is hunched over, broken.}
