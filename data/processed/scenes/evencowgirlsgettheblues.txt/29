<A>__{sissy bounces out of the bed and patters through the living room and crawls under the cover with julian. julian stirs awake.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{oh, sissy. i am sorry about all the fuss.}
<A>__{julian and sissy embrace and go at it under the covers but suddenly: julian stops after a brief climax.}
<C>__{julian}
<P>__{(with downcast eyes)}
<D>__{i apologize.}
<A>__{sissy cradles julian and comforts him.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{it is the measure of western civilization that it can encompass in harmony, balance off, as it were, such divergent masterworks as a midsummer night's dream and the american dream, as the dome of the sistine chapel and the ceiling of the paris opera.}
<A>__{sissy sits up, her eyes moping about the apartment, looking but not seeing the macrame wallhangings, the volumes of robert frost.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<A>__{after a while sissy answers.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{i'm cold.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{here. i will turn down the air conditioner.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{it's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. nothing moves in here. not even your birds.}
<A>__{sissy gets out of bed and begins to dress.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{sissy}

<C>__{julian}
<D>__{but i don't want you to leave. please stay. we can go to dinner. i owe you a dinner. and tonight... we can... really make love.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{i have to go, julian.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{why? why do you have to go?}
<C>__{sissy}
<P>__{(somewhat frantic)}
<D>__{my thumbs hurt. i've made a mistake. i've been negligent. i haven't exercised. i have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. it's like a musician practicing his scales. when i don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.}
