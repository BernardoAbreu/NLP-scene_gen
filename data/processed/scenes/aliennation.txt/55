<L>__{interior biltmore hotel foyer night}
<A>__{sykes, followed by a reluctant jetson, bears down on harcourt, who is exiting the hotel with his date, and kipling. we see kipling recognize sykes from their fight two nights before... but because kipling looks so different, sykes doesn't recognize him outright. still, during this, sykes senses something, though he's not sure what.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{william harcourt?}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{i'm sergeant sykes, and this is detective jetson, los angeles police department.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<P>__{(nodding greeting)}
<D>__{sergeant... detective. i wasn't aware there were any newcomers at the rank of detective yet.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{i am the first.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{congratulations. this is my administrative assistant, rudyard kipling.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(throw away)}
<D>__{rudyard kipling? no shit?}
<P>__{(to harcourt)}
<D>__{listen, we just need a minute of your time...}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{we'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, warren hubley.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{yes, i heard about poor warren. tragic.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{you were partners with him on some slag uh, newcomer real estate thing.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{that's right. he and i, along with seven or eight others. listen, gentlemen, i will be happy to assist you in any way i can unfortunately, at the moment, i'm overdue at another function.}
<A>__{suddenly there's a voice from o.s.:}
<C>__{mayor }
<D>__{william...}
<A>__{harcourt turns as the mayor and his wife step up.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{mr. mayor...}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{william, i was wondering if you wouldn't rather ride with luisa and me. two limousines trying to make it across town in all this traffic, we're bound to be later than we already are.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{excellent idea. ray, i wonder if you know two of your police officers... detective jetson and sykes.}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(shaking their hands, dismissively)}
<D>__{a pleasure.}
<P>__{(to harcourt)}
<D>__{we really should be going.}
<A>__{the wind is knocked from sykes' sails by the presence of the mayor with a very impatient expression. harcourt smiles.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{please feel free to call my office monday morning for an appointment.}
<P>__{(to jetson)}
<D>__{congratulations again on your promotion, detective. remember... you're out there setting an example in our community. i will be keeping an eye on you.}
<A>__{harcourt is smiling as he says this last, but his eyes are penetrating... telegraphing a subliminal warning. harcourt and entourage move off... leaving sykes steaming.}
