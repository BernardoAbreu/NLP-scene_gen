<L>__{interior charlie's office night}
<A>__{charlie is behind her desk, as haven walks in. behind him, sweating now, comes mark. as the two are in the room the door behind them slams shut. mick is there with a gun. prince moves slightly out of a shadow. mark backs against a wall. charlie looks up from her fingernails. haven smiles and glances around. his eyes fix on mick and the gun.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i see you found the difference.}
<A>__{mick says nothing, his face a blank hatred. haven sits down in a big chair.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{looks like a board meeting.}
<A>__{another door opens and pete, the sawmill foreman, enters, stands silently. haven glances at him, then at charlie who smiles thinly back.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(indicating mark)}
<D>__{what's he doing with you?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i thought i might need a lawyer.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i doubt it.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i can realize how seldom legal technicalities annoy you but i have one that might.}
<P>__{(taking out his pipe)}
<D>__{besides, he knows all about it.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{about a gear box i failed to deliver.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{i don't know anything! i merely }
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{mark relapses into a perspiring silence.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{mark is right. he doesn't know anything. he just knows what i dictated to him in a deposition.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and what was that?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{it was just a story. about a man who got murdered, a thief who got shot, and a gear box that got lost. probably nobody would believe it }
<P>__{(glancing up)}
<D>__{...unless i got killed for it.}
<A>__{charlie stares at him a moment. then she glances at pete.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{go downstairs, pete. watch the stairway.}
<A>__{pete walks out.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(to haven)}
<D>__{who else have you told?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{no one. mark i had to have. he's a witness and a notary. he makes it stick. he stands it up in court.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(always watching his face)}
<D>__{what keeps it from getting to a court?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{a cut.}
<C>__{mick}
<D>__{he's running a bluff!}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i ran one on you.}
<A>__{mick burns in silence. charlie smiles.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you brought your lawyer. ask him if this doesn't sound like blackmail.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{he can't think very clearly in the presence of a gun.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{but it doesn't bother you?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{no, it doesn't.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{what you want is money.}
<A>__{haven nods.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't see how going to the law will get it for you.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{if you did see how, i'd never get there, would i?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm afraid not.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{so it boils down to this: we can make a deal, and all be happy together.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{not as long as you always have something on us.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{unless you also have something on me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and how would that be?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{when i deliver the gold to you.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you mean the gear box?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i can even forget i looked inside. so i stole a gear box... i'm still a thief.}
<A>__{charlie is silent a moment. haven lights his pipe. charlie looks at mark, pale by the wall.}
<C>__{prince}
<P>__{(indicating mark)}
<D>__{what does he get?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{he gets even with you.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{have you lost your mind!}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{it was all right when he lost his money.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{all right... i will give him the iou's... when the gear box is delivered.}
<C>__{prince}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you don't realize how important it is when a piece of machinery breaks down. it could close the entire sawmill.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i guess i didn't realize it.}
<A>__{she looks coolly at mick and mark.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i think that's all.}
<A>__{mark glances at haven who nods and mark leaves in the wake of the grimly departing mick. prince lingers.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(to haven)}
<D>__{you can stay.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(to prince)}
<D>__{i think she was talking to me.}
<A>__{prince gets up grimly, his lips tight, the dice held hard in his fingers. he stares at haven.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{you roll nice dice and you bet them jamb up, but some day you'll slip. and when you do, i will be around to catch you.}
<A>__{he turns and walks out. haven watches him go.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you know, i think he will.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{then you should be more careful.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{the poorhouses are filled with careful men...}
<P>__{(knocking out his pipe)}
<D>__{...and so are the graveyards.}
<A>__{charlie comes around and sits on the arm of his chair.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you've got a nice perfume.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{carnation.}
<P>__{(she ruffles his hair with her hand)}
<D>__{i almost had to have you killed. i'd have hated it.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{so would i.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'd have missed you... too much.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{and too long.}
<A>__{she brushes his cheek with her lips.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(she smiles at him)}
<D>__{did you ever tell a woman you loved her?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{all of them.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{how did you get away?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i was always in the doorway when i said it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you never said it to me.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{let's go over to the doorway.}
<A>__{he rises and so does she. she picks up a scarf in silence and anger, crosses and goes out the door, haven following her.}
