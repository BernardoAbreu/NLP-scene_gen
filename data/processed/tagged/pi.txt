<L>__{extreme close up of maximilian cohen's eyes popping open. interior max's apartment chinatown flat new york city night}
<A>__{max jolts his head from his desk and tries to orient him self in the darkness. he has intelligent eyes set in an exhausted, good looking face. then he notices the blood dripping from his nose. max wipes it. max's voiceover begins:}

<B>__{tight on}
<A>__{max's hand as three unmarked, circular pills hit his palm. then, he slams the pills into the back of his mouth. max replaces the cap on a plastic bottle of unmarked prescription drugs. he drinks from the sink and splashes a generous amount of water onto his head and face, cleaning his nose. he wipes his nose and examines the last remnants of blood on his fingertip. then, he dips his finger under the tap.}
<L>__{interior max's apartment main room day}
<A>__{max's room is constantly dark because the windows are blacked out. he flips on his desk lamp. a tiny ant crawls across his desk. he looks at it for a moment before getting angry and squashing it. sitting on the desk are three computer monitors, which max flips on. then he pops on more lights and more switches. we pull back revealing that max's apartment looks more like the inside of a computer than a human's home. the room is knee high in computer parts of all shapes and sizes. the walls are covered with circuit boards. cables hang from the ceiling like vines in a brazilian rain forest. they all seem to be wired together forming a monstrous homemade computer. this is euclid, max's creation. the computer is alive with sounds and lights. max works on euclid with his solder and drill. he cares for the machine as if it were his dream car}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{heat's been getting to euclid. feel it most in the afternoon when i run the set. have to keep the fans on all night from now on. otherwise, everything is running topnotch. the stack of 286's is now faster than columbia's computer science department. i spent a couple hundred dollars. columbia's cost? half a million?}
<P>__{(small snicker)}
<D>__{ha...}
<A>__{max checks the peephole on his front door. no one is there. he unbolts the five lock and slides into the hall.}
<L>__{interior apartmenj hallway day}
<A>__{as he secures his apartment, a young girl named jenna runs up to him. her mom, down the hall, looks apologetic. jenna's eyes light up and she pulls out her fisher price calculator.}

<C>__{mom}
<P>__{(over and over again)}
<D>__{jenna! jenna!}

<A>__{max watches people bustle through the busy intersections of chinatown. the streets are clogged with people.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{somewhere in there. somewhere. i know it's right in front of me. the pattern. they say it's chaos, it can't be understood, too much complexity.}
<L>__{exterior electronic megadump day}
<A>__{max scavenges electronic parts as he carefully navigates an endless dump for old and rotting computers.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{history it's there. lurking, shaping. structuring, hiding, right beneath the surface.}

<C>__{max }
<D>__{the cycling of disease epidemics, the wax and wane of caribou populations in the arctic, sunspot cycles, the rise and fall of the nile and yes! the new york stock exchange, they are all the same.}

<T>__{slow dissolve to extreme close:}
<A>__{ up of stock ticker bright stock quotes drift across the screen.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{i will find this structure, this order, this perfection.}
<L>__{interior max's apartment day}
<A>__{max stares intensely at the ticker on the small tv that sits next to his monitors.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{turn lead into gold. the first. right here. right here. with math. the numbers of the stock market are my lead. when i find the pattern, then i will find gold.}
<A>__{max watches the right edge of the screen where the numbers appear. he wants to see what's before that edge... max slaps the return button on his computer. the phone starts ringing. max eyes it suspiciously. just then, euclid starts printing results on an old dot matrix printer. max suspiciously answers the phone.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{maximilian cohen, please.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{mr. cohen?}

<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{hi. my name is marcy dawson. i'm a partner with the predictive strategy firm lancet percy. can i speak with mr. cohen, please?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i told you...}
<A>__{the printer finishes printing.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{mr. cohen! how are you? it's been a long time. sorry i haven't been in touch. but i was hoping you would allow me to take you to lunch tomorrow, say one o'clock?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{sorry, i can't.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{we're very anxious to talk with you, sir}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{i'm prepared to make you a generous...}
<A>__{max hurries to wrap up the conversation.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i don't take offers for my research. you know that. sorry, i couldn't help you.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{mr. cohen, give me a moment...}
<A>__{but before marcy finishes, max hangs up. he rips off the printout and heads to the front door. he checks the peephole, his landlady. mrs. ovadia, is sweeping the hallway stairs humming a turn of the century (the last one, not this one) tune. max waits a moment. he tousles his hair. then he checks again. she's gone. he opens his locks and releases several bolts.}
<L>__{interiormax's building hallway day}
<A>__{max locks his front door. meanwhile, his next door neighbor, devi minstry, a sexy young indian woman, is just getting home. max looks away and tries to get his door locked. she's weighted down by a bunch of bags filled with food.}
<C>__{devi}
<D>__{max, good!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{hi, devi.}
<C>__{dev1}
<D>__{i grabbed you some somosas.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{devi heads over to max with her bags of food. she looks up at max.}
<C>__{devi}
<D>__{your hair.}
<A>__{devi hands the bags to max. then she goes to pat down his hair. max retreats.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{devi}
<D>__{your hair, you can't go out like that. don't worry.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's fine. it's fine.}
<A>__{devi pats down his hair. max is humiliated.}
<C>__{devi}
<D>__{you need a mom.}
<A>__{max hands back the bags and heads quickly for the stairs.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i have to go.}
<C>__{devi}
<D>__{your somosas!}
<A>__{an embarrassed max takes the bag.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{thanks.}
<L>__{interior coffee shop day}
<A>__{at the counter, max stirs cream into his coffee. then he takes three pills from the plastic bottle and drops them in his coffee. max flips past a full page ad in the paper that reads lancet percy 86% accuracy (only god is perfect). max flips the page before he or we can absorb it. he compares stock quotes in the wall street journal against his printout.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{sixteen, twenty seven. results: euclid shows tomorrow's dow closing up by four points. anomalies include pronet at sixty fire and a quarter, a career high. possible explanations, either a, an error in the june fifth algorithm, or b, euclid's main processor is running a recursion...}
<A>__{max marks up the paper with lines and diagrams as he ponders his bits and misses. then a puff of cigarette smoke drifts by and succeeds in bothering max. he fans it away when}
<C>__{voice from offscreen}
<D>__{oh sorry, am i bothering you?}
<A>__{max shrugs and looks over. the voice belongs to lenny meyera bearded man in his late 20s sucking on a cigarette. on closer inspection, something is off. it seems that lenny is an orthodox jew. his yarmulke sticks out slightly from his wide brimmed hat and the fringes from his tsi tsis hang out from the bottom of his untucked shirt.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{i will put it out.}
<P>__{(which he does)}
<D>__{the name's lenny meyer}
<A>__{lenny sticks out his hand. max responds with a small nod.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{and you are?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{max.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{max?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{max cohen.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{cohen!}
<P>__{(judging)}
<D>__{jewish?}
<A>__{max shrugs and turns back to his work.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<P>__{(joking)}
<D>__{i'm a jew, too.}
<P>__{(serious)}
<D>__{do you practice?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no, i'm not interested in religion.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{have you ever heard of kabbalah?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{jewish mysticism.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i'm very busy.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{i understand...it's just that it's a very exciting time in our history. right now is a critical moment in time.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{yes, it's very exciting. have you ever put on tefillin?}
<A>__{max has no idea what lenny's talking about. lenny pulls a leather box with black leather straps from his pocket.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{tefillin. you know tefillin. i know it looks strange. but it's an amazing tradition that has a tremendous amount of power. it's a mitzvah for all jewish men to do. mitzvahs, good deeds, are spiritual food for our hearts and our heads.}
<A>__{and then max notices that his thumb is twitching he grabs it self consciously.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{they purify us and bring us closer to god. you want to try it?}
<A>__{just then, max pays his bill and prepares to leave.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i gotta go...}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{are you okay? max? max?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm sorry, bye.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{well, maybe some other time.}
<L>__{interior max's bathroom night}
<A>__{max splashes water on his face.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{please god, let it be a small one.}
<A>__{he pulls a metal vaccinating gun out of the medicine cabinet. then be loads it with a small bottle of medicine. he rolls up his sleeve, dabs alcohol on his arm, and fires the gun into his arm.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{sixteen thirty five. second headache in under twenty four hours. they're getting more frequent now...more painful, too. drugs don't work, just take the edge off of it. just gotta wait for the nosebleed. relief comes from my nose.}
<A>__{next door, he hears devi and her boyfriend talking.}
<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{so i gotta make this drop off in harlem and on the way down there's these three kids hailing me.}
<A>__{max slaps himself in the face a few times.}
<C>__{devi }
<D>__{you stopped?}
<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{i was tight, so...}
<A>__{max watches his thumb twitch. and then pain shoots through him. he grabs the right side of his head, massages it, and pushes it in with his fingers. in the mirror, he examines the right side of his scalp. he sees nothing}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{ahh...}
<A>__{max walks back into the}
<B>__{main room}
<A>__{and sits down in a chair. the lamp is blinding so he snaps it off. only the bathroom light lights the room. he takes a few breaths.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{leave me alone.}
<A>__{his neighbors conversation begins to build in volume and distortion.}
<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{so i drop them off in the village and they dart.}
<C>__{devi }
<D>__{oh god...}
<A>__{max gags and rubs his head.}
<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{i get out, grab my bat and start running. one of the kids, maybe sixteen, i catch a block later he's cursing at me, calling me a paki bastard. so i whacked him, right in the head.}
<C>__{devi }
<D>__{farrouhk!}
<A>__{the pain seems to disappear. max looks at his hand that was rubbing his bead. then he looks at the front door. the doorknob seems to move. something begins knocking on max's door. the knocking gets louder and louder then the locks begin to unlock. farrouhk's words begin to overpower max.}
<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{i'm kicking the bastard in the ribs banging his ass, knocking his head against the curb, harder and harder, i fucking lost it. a hot dog guy starts screaming "you're cracking his skull, you're cracking his skull." so they pulled me off of him and calmed me down. cops said he had it coming to him.}
<A>__{then something starts pounding the door. the doorknob quivers, the locks unbolt. the chains are the only thing keeping out the intruder. the door shakes and the chains are strained. max is paralyzed with terror.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no! no!}
<A>__{and then the door smashes open. blinding light fills the room and we crash into the}
<B>__{blinding white void}
<A>__{a moment of silence, then we}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior bathroom dawn}
<A>__{a phone rings incessantly. max's eyes pop open. he's scrunched up in a corner of the room, squashed beneath the sink. his nose is bleeding. max, crawls into the}
<B>__{main room}
<A>__{and picks up the phone. he pinches his nose and tilts his head back.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{mr. cohen. marcy dawson here again i was just looking over my schedule and i realized i will be in your neighborhood tomorrow around three.}
<A>__{max heads to the}
<B>__{front door}
<A>__{and checks the locks. he is barely listening to marcy}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(groggy)}
<D>__{who is...}
<A>__{the locks seem secure.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{marcy dawson from lancet percy i'm so anxious to meet you. it will be worth itfor both of us i promise. see you at your house at three, okay?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{my house...how do...}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{oh, don't worry, i got your address from columbia. so three it is. looking forward to it.}
<A>__{max tries to stop her but, before he can marcy hangs up. a bewildered max slowly hangs up.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{damn.}
<A>__{max checks the peephole all clear. then, he opens his }
<B>__{closet}
<A>__{which is filled with random computer parts and boxes. he pulls a thick neuroscience book from a shelf in the back of the closet. he almost knocks over an old dusty brass microscope on the shelf. max flips through the book. it contains old plates illustrating the brain. max examines some of the diagrams.}
<L>__{exterior s0l's hallway day max rings the bell on an apartment}
<A>__{door. a few moments pass, and then sol robeson opens the door. sol is a wise looking man in his early 70's. he walks with difficulty, leaning out of breath on a wooden cane. his arms are covered with faded russian prison tattoos and he speaks with a thick eastern european accent, he's happy to see max.}
<C>__{s0l}
<D>__{max! how are you7}
<A>__{max is happy to see sol, but he's a bit bashful and intimidated.}
<D>__{max okay.}
<L>__{exterior sol's study moments later}
<A>__{tight on the japanese game of go being played. sol is white and max is black. sol's moves are secure and controlled while max is hesitant.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{stop thinking, max, just feel. use your intuition. it's the only way to get into the flow.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what did you think of hamlet?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i didn't get to it.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{it's been a month.}
<P>__{(knowingly)}
<D>__{you haven't taken a single break.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm so close, sol. i'm so close but i just can't grab it.}
<A>__{sol changes the subject. he feeds his goldfish and points to one of them.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{have you met the new fish my niece bought me? i named her icarus. after you. my renegade pupil. you fly too high, you'll get burned.}
<A>__{max looks up at sol.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{the more i see you, the more i see myself thirty years ago. my greatest pupil. published at 16, ph.d. at 20.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{we'll see.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{but life isn't just mathematics. i spent forty years looking for patterns in pi, i found nothing.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you found things...}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{i found things, but not a pattern.}
<L>__{interior moving trail day}
<A>__{max sits in the corner of a rickety new york city subway car. the train is almost completely deserted. max looks down at his hand. he opens his palm and reveals a black go chip.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{tuesday, september second, eighteen twelve. if sol hadn't gotten sick who knows where math would be. he spent years in the numbers of pi. searching for meaning, for order.}
<A>__{max notices a skinny man in a business suit staring at him. the man catches max's eye and looks away, but then he quickly looks back, making max turn away. he looks down at his wall street journal and draws a circle with its diameter then he writes "a=pir2" and "c=2pir." next he writes "pi=3.14159..."}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{three point one four...off into infinity and maybe insanity. somewhere in there he wanted sanity. sanity like he found in the circles pi represented. simple, sane circles. if only the stock market had circles. some type of sanity. some type of form, of shape.}
<A>__{suddenly, max hears someone singing. max looks up. it is the skinny man and he's singing with passion. it's all very strange to max, who nervously looks away. and then the singing stops mid verse max looks up and the man is gone. vanished. max looks aroundno one in sight.}
<L>__{interior apartment staircase day}
<A>__{max heads up the stairs to his apartment. just then, a toy slinky appears from nowhere marching down the stairs. max stops and waits until the slinky hits his foot. he picks it up and looks at it. he looks around wondering what's going on. then jenna leans out over a railing and starts laughing at max.}
<L>__{interior coffee shop day}
<A>__{max sits at the counter frantically looking at the wall street journal. he plops three pills into his coffee. he draws circles and other shapes across the page. max is interrupted by a puff of smoke. at the same time, someone touches his shoulder and says:}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{hey, max, how you doing?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{oh, okay.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{lenny meyer.}
<P>__{(motioning to the cigarette)}
<D>__{i will put it out.}
<P>__{(which be does)}
<D>__{so, what do you do?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{um, i work with computers ...math.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{really? what type of math?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{number theory. mostly research.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{number theory? no way, i work in theory, too. not traditional, though...}
<P>__{(points to his yarmulke)}
<D>__{i work with the torah.}
<P>__{(awed by the coincidence)}
<D>__{amazing.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(passing it of as a coincidence)}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{yeah. you know hebrew is all numbers. it's all math.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{hm.}
<A>__{lenny pulls out a worn' dog eared bible from his pocket. there are paper slips marking what seems like every other page. when he opens it up, max sees that the pages are marked up by highlighter pens, notes and diagrams. lenny points to the texterior extreme close up of hebrew letters.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{here, look...the ancient jews used hebrew as their numerical system. each letter is a number.}
<A>__{lenny pulls out a pen and grabs max's journal. he writes on it as he talks.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{you see...the hebrew "a," the number 1. the hebrew "b," bet, is two. you can take any hebrew text and turn them into a long string of numbers.}
<A>__{the waitress refills max's coffee.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{the torah is just a long string of numbers. some say that it's a long code sent to us from god.}
<A>__{satisfied, lenny lights up a cigarette and takes a drag.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(mildly impressed)}
<D>__{kind of interesting.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<P>__{(proud of himself)}
<D>__{yeah, like take the hebrew word for, say, the garden of eden, kadem. kuf, dalei mem...kuf is a hundred. daled, four mem, forty. they equal one hundred and forty four. then take the tree of knowledge...in the garden, aat ha haim, it equals two hundred and thirty three. now you can take that number and...}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{they're fibonacci numbers.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{the fibonacci sequence. italian mathematician, thirteenth century. if you divide a hundred and forty four into two hundred and thirty three, it approaches theta.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{theta?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{the greek symbol for the golden ratio. the golden spiral.}
<A>__{lenny exhales the smoke. max quickly graphs the number on his wall street journal.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{you're right, i never saw that before. that's the series you find in nature. like the face of a sunflower.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{wherever there's spirals.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{you see, there's math everywhere.}
<A>__{lenny's smoke drifts by max's eyes. slow motion: max's pov of smoke spirals spinning in front of him.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{math everywhere...}
<A>__{slow motion: max looks down at his coffee cup. he pours cream into his coffee. it shoots up and mixes with the black coffee forming spirals in the mug.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(serious)}
<D>__{everywhere...}
<A>__{slow motion: max looks at the spiral he just drew on the wall street journal. normal speed suddenly, max stands up.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<L>__{interior max's apartment day}
<A>__{max draws spirals all over his wall street journal. then he takes a thick black marker and draws a giant spiral across the entire page. max is ecstatic as he pounds code into the computer takes moments to wake up, drops pills, and drinks a ginseng soda.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{simple shapes! tuesday, september second. twenty twenty two. sol! sol! sol! shapes in the market. why not? and they're spirals! spirals!}
<A>__{max traces a big circle on the journal. then, he cuts it out with an x acto blade. he cuts out the middle of the circle so that be has a thin loop like one of those futuristic frisbees. he tears part of the loop and stretches the circle out in front of him into a spiral.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{a circle spread out overtime. it's open ended. it has a beginning and it grows and changes through time. if i can find where it fits, if i can spin it and lock it into a group of numbers, then i can calculate the future. lead into gold. chaos into order madness into sanity. pain into bliss. perfection.}
<A>__{max is about to slap return but he stops himselfhe's nervous. next door, devi and her boyfriend are making love. he looks at the wall with disdain. then he looks back at the screen, shrugs and confidently slaps return on his keyboard. stock prices float across the screen. max can't believe his eyesthe quotes are absurd.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what the...}
<A>__{and then, euclid crashes. the electricity in max's room flips off. the numbers on max's screen fade to black. in near (minus streetlights) darkness:}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{shit!}
<B>__{tight on a fuse box}
<A>__{max removes a fuse. he replaces it with a penny. max's room max tries to reboot euclid, but nothing happens. he tries a second time, but nothing happens. devi and farrouhk are still at it. max puts on a pair of latex gloves. he dons a surgical mask. he climbs up to a loft above his monitors. a glass case, fed cool air by a vent tube, encases some computer parts. he carefully removes the front glass cover. then he gets it off he's stunned. not only have the chips melted down, but a strange flaky substance covers the board.}
