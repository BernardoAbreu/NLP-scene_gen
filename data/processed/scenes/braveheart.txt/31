<L>__{interior prince edward's royal apartments day}
<A>__{the prince and a muscular young friend, phillip, are stripped to the waist and fencing. they pay no attention to the knock, or to the princess as she enters. she watches them they are dancing more than fencing. edward loses his sword; it clatters to the polished floor. he looks up at his wife, as if angry at her for having seen his clumsiness.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{what is it?!}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{you directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{so i did! and what was so important about it?}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{scotland. he intends }
<A>__{but edward and his friend are fencing again, the clanging of their blunted swords so loud that she can't hear herself.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{he intends to grant }
<A>__{edward loses his weapon again, and whirls on her.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{shut up, would you! how can i concentrate?!}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{...his majesty was quite keen that you should understand }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{all so very boring! he wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!}
<A>__{for an instant, anger flares into her eyes. she glances at edward, and at the young man with him, then lowers her eyes and starts to back out. but edward has noticed.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{stop there.}
<A>__{she stops, but does not raise her eyes.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{do you disapprove of phillip?}
<A>__{he lifts his hand and draws his friend phillip to his side. still the princess does not lift her eyes.}
<C>__{princess}
<P>__{(barely audible)}
<D>__{no, m'lord.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{look at me. i said look at me!}
<A>__{she lifts her eyes. but she could not brace herself enough for what she sees: edward nuzzling phillip, the prince's bare chest to his muscular friend's bare back, both men glistening with sweat and sexual excitement. the princess's eyes quiver... but she does not look away.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{now, my flower, do you understand?}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{yes. i had thought that... i was loathsome to you. perhaps i am. if i may be excused, m'lord.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you may.}
<A>__{she starts to leave, as quietly as she came. but her husband calls after her.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{don't worry, m'lady, it is my royal responsibility to breed. and i assure you, when the time comes, i shall... manage.}
<A>__{she closes the door softly, on her husband and his lover.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{now in edinburgh were gathered the council of scottish nobles...}
<A>__{establishing council day the picturesque heart of scotland, with its castle on a fairy tale plateau above the firth of forth.}
