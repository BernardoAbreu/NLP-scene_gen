<A>__{two tiny bare light bulbs give faint, eerie illumination to the chamber. one one side, a pot bellied stove flickers, etching the shadows of the walkers in a strange orange glow. some lunatics, not walking, hover around the stove. others are jammed onto a low l shaped wooden platform that runs the length of two walls. of these men are naked, covered with open running sores over their knees, elbows, buttocks. but they are much quieter than the upstairs crowd. they are the lowest order of madmen. they have no minds left. they are the damned. billy walks among them, expressionless. a tall, thin cadaverous turk with a grizzled beard now shuffles up alongside billy, looks at him, walks with him. is about fifty, his pyjamas relatively clean, looking more sane than the average but his eyes are bright and scary and his wet hair is matted down on his head, and big clumps of it have been pulled out. he speaks with a cultured english accent.}
<C>__{ahmet}
<D>__{you're an american?}
<A>__{billy is interrupted but keeps his eyes on the ground. ahmet doesn't wait for an answer.}
<C>__{ahmet}
<D>__{ah yes, america! my name is ahmet. i studied philosophy at harvard for many many years. but actually oxford is my real alma mata i've also studied in vienna. now i study here.}
<A>__{billy doesn't notice, shuffles along.}
<C>__{ahmet}
<D>__{...they put me here. they say i raped a little boy. i have been here very long time. they will never let me go.}
<A>__{billy pays no attention, keeps shuffling on. glances at him, smiles.}
<C>__{ahmet}
<D>__{they won't let you go either.}
<A>__{the smug certainty of his manner reaches some chord deep inside billy, because billy glances briefly at this lunatic who is smiling. billy looks back at his feet.}
<C>__{ahmet}
<D>__{no, they'll never let you go. they tell you they let you go but you stay. you never go from here.}
<A>__{billy plods on. grins and tries to explain the situation like a father lecturing a child.}
<C>__{ahmet}
<D>__{you see we all come from a factory. sometimes the factory makes bad machines that don't work. they put them here. the bad machines don't know they're bad machines, but the people at the factory know. they know one of the machines that doesn't work...}
<A>__{they walk on. ahmet's expression changes.}
<C>__{ahmet}
<P>__{(polite)}
<D>__{i think we have spoken enough for today. i say good night to you.}
<A>__{he wraps his rags around himself quite carefully and we follow him out of the circle. he drops to his hands and knees and with a sense of dignity, crawls into the filthy blackness under the l shaped wooden platform, disappearing like a cockroach. billy plods on.}
