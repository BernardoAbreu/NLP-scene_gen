<ACTION>__{A MULTI-COLORED SCREEN After a few introductory credits, we pull back to reveal the source of this kaleidoscopic backdrop: A SINGLE, STRIPED TULIP, planted in a long row of other tulips. A HAND reaches in and pulls the tulip from the ground. We then cut to: A BASKET of tulips, carried by hand to a truck, where it is loaded with hundreds of other baskets. The door of the truck is SHUT and we cut to: The door of the truck OPENING to reveal that the tulips are now boxed and crated. A forklift moves the crates onto a wagon, which is driven by a MANNED CART across the biggest warehouse on the planet, the Bloenen Markt (CHECK THIS-- steven) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The cart and wagons we were following disappear into a maze of synchronized activity. The cart arrives in the AUCTION ROOM, which is constructed like an ampitheater: the buyers sit in a steeply raked semi-circle, facing two giant, clock-shaped scoreboards that display the bids on the flowers being viewed. The striped tulips fetch a very high price. The carts of striped tulips are delivered to an automated sorting apparatus of enormous size and complexity. They end up on a truck heading for the airport.}
