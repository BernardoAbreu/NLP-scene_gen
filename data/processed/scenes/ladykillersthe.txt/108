<L>__{interior munson living room night}
<A>__{in the foreground mrs. munson sits knitting, humming an old temperance tune. in the background the cellar door swings open. marva munson doesn't notice; her knitting needles continue their rhythmic clack. we pull gawain, gun at the ready, as he takes slow, cautious steps across the floor. we intercut : his pov of the back of the old lady's head, bowed over her knitting. as gawain passes the sofa he picks up a cushion and buries in it his hand holding the gun. he looks back up at the old lady. but now, still cautiously approaching, he cocks his head, his expression bemused.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{nearing the old lady is now different somehow. the perspective is somewhat lower; the humming woman sounds not quite the same; the rocking chair and the room itself are subtly different.}
