<L>__{interior gary's house a den continuous}
<A>__{unlike the housemen, gary doesn't follow the paintings. he moves swiftly, seems to know where milo is. gary's workroom continuous milo still working... party room continuous alice looks up at the digital painting: still a bosch. her face sets grimly.}
<L>__{interior gary's workroom continuous}
<A>__{milo clicks, closing the window. concentrating, he doesn't see what we see on the wall behind him: the mondrian drains away... and the wall fills up with the hellish bosch triptych. after a moment, milo senses something. gary stands in the doorway. watching him. milo doesn't breathe. gary crosses the room, eyes locked with milo's. gary comes behind milo. he reads the screen. it's filled with text, whatever milo loaded in when he sat down.}
<C>__{gary}
<P>__{(reading the screen)}
<D>__{"dear lisa. i've enjoyed working with you. i'd be lying if i didn't say i find you attractive. but in my heart i know that alice..."}
<P>__{(he looks up)}
<D>__{you left my party to send e mail?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for obvious reasons.}
<A>__{gary stares at milo. he looks skeptical. the party music floats in from afar as the moment stretches.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{you could've handwritten it.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i'm not much good at handwriting. or parties.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{oh, that's right. you're "clueless."}
<A>__{this hangs there.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{gary, i'm sorry if i was rude }
<A>__{the second houseman sticks his head in.}
<C>__{houseman}
<D>__{everything ok, mr. boyd?}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{no problem.}
<P>__{(when he's gone)}
<D>__{is there?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{gary, i }
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{you see what's hanging on the wall?}
<A>__{he looks over. milo looks over. among the framed commendations, awards, degrees we see milo's childhood program, written on outpost 1.0. gary has had it framed. milo absorbs it. even now, he feels something for gary.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{i hope you know what you mean to me. not just because of what you're doing. because of who you are.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i do know, gary. i feel the same way. i thought i was coming here for a job. but it's meant a lot more.}
<A>__{milo smiles almost tenderly. he doesn't know if gary buys it. perhaps if he could see gary's eyes. but they're obscured by bosch's writhing bodies, reflected on his eyeglasses. gary moves away from milo, he stands over the table with the art books, vaguely looks through one.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{when will you have a beta version?}
<A>__{milo wonders: does he know? he picks his words carefully.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i'm pretty close. but when i wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. you know what it's like, writing software.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{i do know. you focus on the big problem. but somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. something gets destroyed. at first it's upsetting. you feel you've lost control.}
<A>__{gary puts down the book. something in his tone draws milo.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{so you have to remind yourself: it's just the process. something's always lost along the way to anything worthwhile. some little bug, some glitch. 'can't get bogged down in that, you're doing something other people could never do. they lack the imagination, the brain, the nerve. let them fret about every unforeseen consequence. you have to solve the problem. that's who you are.}
<A>__{is this a confession? a plea for understanding? or just a pep talk to keep milo focused on skywire?}
