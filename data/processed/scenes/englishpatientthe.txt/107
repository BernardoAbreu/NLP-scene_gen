<L>__{interior almasy's room. day.}
<A>__{almasy lying on a camp bed, face down. the walls are covered with maps, enlargements of photographs. a fan whirs over his kit which is spread, unraveled but ordered, on the stone floor. an ineffably male room, the shutters closed, just the thinnest shaft of light piercing the gloom. almasy hasn't even removed his clothes, his boots kicked off below his jutting feet. there's a knock at the door. almasy sleeps. another. a third. he's roused from the dead. stumbles to his feet, opens the door as the knocking continues. it's katharine. she's bathed, luminous, stands back lit by the afternoon sun an angel in a cotton dress. she walks past him into the room. he closes the door. she turns. he kneels before her, head at her thighs. she's crying, her face expressionless as her hands go to his head.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{you still have sand in your hair.}
<A>__{she starts to beat on his head and shoulders, violently. he pulls back, to look at her, the tears streaming down her face. she kneels and covers his face with kisses. he pulls blindly at her dress and it rips across her breasts.}
