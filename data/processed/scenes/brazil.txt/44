<L>__{interior sam's flat night}
<A>__{sam is grabbing the walls of the fridge. water from the defrosted freezer compartment drips on his head. he wakes up. before he can really take in where he is the phone rings. he staggers over to it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hello ... hello ...}
<C>__{phone voice}
<D>__{hello. mr lowry?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{who's that?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<A>__{a sound at the kitchen door turns sam's head and ours just in time to half see a quick blurred movement, but then a rapid voice in his ear piece brings his head back.}
<C>__{phone voice}
<D>__{put the phone down and your hands up.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{what? who is this?}
<A>__{sam realises that the voice is also in the room behind him. he turns round and sees tuttle. tuttle is middle aged, a short tough figure dressed in dark clothes suggesting a cross between a cat burglar and a night raid commando. in one hand he holds a gun pointed at sam. the other hand is holding a telephone receiver which tuttle is in the act of placing in the large capacious bag at his feet. sam puts down his phone, and his hands up.}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{nice and easy now. keep your hands where i can see them.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what is this?}
<P>__{(indignantly)}
<D>__{who the hell are you?}
<A>__{tuttle, keeping the gun on sam, goes to different doors, leaning backwards into bedroom, bathroom and closet. tuttle suddenly relaxes and pockets his gun.}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{harry tuttle. heating engineer. at your service.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{tuttle! are you from central services?}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{ha!!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{but ... i called central services.}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{they're a bit overworked these days. luckily i intercepted your call.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{by now, both are pouring with sweat. tuttle heads across the room and swiftly begins to undo a wall panel.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{wait a minute, what was that business with the gun?}
<A>__{tuttle hands sam the panel and plunges his arm into the space behind it.}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{a little precaution, sir. i've had traps set for me before now. there are people in central services who'd love to get their hands on harry tuttle.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{are you saying this is illegal?}
<A>__{by now tuttle has managed to pull out some sections of flexible ducting from the welter of mechanical offal behind the removed panel. it is all very complicated and greasy and it looks as though there is a lot more where that came from. tuttle is amazingly neat and deft as he works. a real pro. as he works he hums a wee tune ... yes ... brazil!!}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{well, yes ... and no. officially, only central service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... could you hold these.}
<C>__{tuttle}
<P>__{(he hands sam a bunch of wires that he has detached)}
<D>__{... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as i'm careful.}
<P>__{(he hands sam a torch)}
<D>__{... mind you, if ever they could prove i'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for central services?}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{couldn't stand the pa ah we're getting warm }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{the pace?}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{the paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.}
<P>__{(indicating the torch)}
<D>__{over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. hold it there. yes, there's more bits of paper in central services than bits of pipe read this, fill in that, hand in the other listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and i couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27b 6.... bloody paperwork.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(mildly)}
<D>__{well i suppose one has to expect a certain amount}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{why? i came into this game for adventure go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. i'm the last of a breed. ah ha! found it!}
<P>__{(he holds up a small charred gadget)}
<D>__{there's your problem.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{can you fix it?}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{no. but i can bypass it with one of these}
<A>__{he pulls another gadget from his bag.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{the door bell. tuttle grabs for his gun.}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{are you expecting anyone?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no. wait here.}
<A>__{he goes out closing the immediate door and goes to the front door which he opens. he is confronted by two officious little men in boiler suits who are standing outside his door. their names are spoor and dowser. dowser is spoor's echo.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{central services.}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{...ervices.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{uh what? i ...}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{you telephone, sir.}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{...elephoned sir.}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{trouble with your air conditioning.}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{...ditioning.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(gulps)}
<D>__{no, not at all. i mean, it's all right. it's fixed.}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{fixed?}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{fixed?}
<A>__{they don't like that.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i mean it fixed itself.}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{fixed itself.}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{...ixed itself.}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{machines don't fix themselves.}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{... fix themselves.}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{he's tampered with it, dowser.}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{...ampered. with it, spoor.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{look, i'm sorry about your wasted journey}
<A>__{sam tries to close the door but spoor prevents this.}
<C>__{spoor}
<P>__{(to dowser)}
<D>__{i think we'd better have a look.}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{... have a look.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no you can't.}
<A>__{he is pushed aside. spoor followed by dowser, heads for the door behind which is mr tuttle. sam is paralysed. spoor approaches the door as if it is dangerous. he turns the handle quietly and gives the door a little nudge. the door begins to swing slowly open. sam suddenly finds inspiration.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{just a minute!}
<A>__{spoor and dowser turn round as the door continues to swing open. when the door is open, behind their backs tuttle is seen holding his pistol in a two handed grip, his knees slightly bent. tuttle freezes like that, pointing his pistol through the open door.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{have you got a 27b 6?}
<A>__{dowser looks very angry. veins stand out on his forehead and he goes into what looks like some sort of fit. spoor knocks him to the ground.}
<C>__{spoor}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{now look what you've done to him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{have you got one or haven't you?}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{not ... as such ...}
<A>__{dowser moans and begins to get back on his feet.}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{but we can get one.}
<C>__{spoor}
<P>__{(worried about dowser)}
<D>__{it's all right, terry, it's all right, everything's all right.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(ushering them to the door)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but i'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{we'll be back.}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{...be back.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(closing the door on them)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{sam turns back to tuttle who is coming forward pocketing his gun.}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{thanks, lowry, you're a good man in a tight corner.}
<A>__{tuttle returns to work, fitting in the new by pass gadget and tightening the nuts, and happily humming "brazil".}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{listen .. um ... i don't want to get involved in any of this. but i work at the ministry of information, and i happen to know that information retrieval have been looking for an archibald tuttle, heating engineer. you wouldn't by any chance be }
<C>__{tuttle}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{my friends call me harry. information retrieval, eh? interesting!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what do they want you or?}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{time to go.}
<A>__{tuttle finishes the job and throws his tools into the bag.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{thank you very much. how much will it...?}
<C>__{tuttle}
<D>__{on the house. you did me a favor. check the corridor.}
<A>__{sam goes to the front door, opens it and looks out.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{all clear.}
<A>__{tuttle slips out and heads off down the balcony corridor.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hey that's a dead end.}
<A>__{but tuttle merely undoes a pre arranged rope and swings tarzan like off the end of the balcony and across a multi story void to a neighboring block. sam is amazed not to say stunned.}
