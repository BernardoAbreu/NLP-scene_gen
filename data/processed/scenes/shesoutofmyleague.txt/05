<L>__{interior airport security checkpoint day}
<A>__{kirk is at his post. stainer works the next x ray belt, where a young rocker type is running a guitar case through. stainer stops the belt and moves it back to get a better look.}

<P>__{(smug)}
<D>__{no, it's a sixty five. minterior}
<C>__{stainer}

<A>__{the rocker boy looks at his watch as stainer rolls the case through and pops it open.}
<C>__{rocker}
<D>__{dude, i'm late for my flight.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{sorry, i have to search this case for, you know, explosives and such. this thing is sweet!}
<A>__{stainer takes the guitar out and starts riffing on it as the bins and bags pile up before him. at kirk's station, molly (the blonde bombshell) is crossing through. every guy who can see her has been struck dumb but kirk banters with her like he would anyone else. no flirting or stammering just friendly and relaxed.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{morning.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh, hello again.}

<D>__{well hang in there kiddo and i guess i will see you tomorrow.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{it's a date.}
<A>__{molly's long legs carry her toward the gates as every man except kirk watches. fuller saunters up and nudges kirk.}
<C>__{fuller}
<D>__{did'ja see that? boy would i ever like to...you know...put my penis}
<P>__{in her vagina. (wink)}
<A>__{back at stainer's station. as he puts the guitar back in its case, he scratches it on the corner of the x ray machine. stainer and rocker boy lock in shocked gazes.}
<C>__{rocker}
<D>__{what the hell!?}
<A>__{he grabs his guitar and inspects a wicked scratch.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{dude, i am so sorry.}

<D>__{sorry my ass! this thing is worth more than you make in a year, you clumsy motherfucker!}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{yeah, i bet it was but...}
<A>__{stainer points to a white sign mounted in an acrylic stand.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{"tsa is not responsible for items lost or damaged in the security screening process..."}
<A>__{stainer flips the sign around to reveal a few more words hand written on the back. he reads them aloud.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{"...so fuck you."}
