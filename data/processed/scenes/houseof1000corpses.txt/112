<L>__{exterior field night}
<A>__{the rain pounds down. a heavy fog hovers over the dense growth of the field. in the distance, silhouetted by moonlight, a gruesome caravan slowly moves through the night. otis, lantern in hand, leads the way. followed by baby and mother together under a large black umbrella. next rufus holds the leash connected to jerry, denise and mary. bringing up the rear, tiny, shotgun focused on the prisoners, and grampa. grampa is strapped to tiny's back like a child. he waves a flashlight back and forth like a search beam. the group comes to a halt at a huge wooden structure.}
<C>__{otis}
<P>__{(handing baby the lantern)}
<D>__{hold this. point it over here.}
<A>__{baby directs the light at otis. we see that he is trying to unlock a huge padlock attached to an iron door embedded in the base of the wooden structure. otis unlocks the door and swings it open. he reaches down into the blackness and pulls up an iron hook and wench, attached to the hook is a chain. otis parts a section of the overgrown grass next to the pit to reveal a rusty metal crank. he begins to turn the crank. slowly, from out of the pit, rises a coffin hanging from the end of the chain. otis pulls the coffin over and lays it flat on the ground. he flips open the lid.}

<A>__{baby jumps with excitement and runs off across the field after mary. mary trips and falls over a small gravestone. she gets up and stumbles back into a wooden cross. she tears the gag from her mouth and gasps for air.}

<D>__{there once was a woman who lived with her daughter in a cabbage garden.}
<A>__{mary turns toward the voice but sees nothing but wooden crosses. she is in a homemade cemetery.}

<C>__{baby}
<D>__{"shoo! shoo!" said the maiden...}
<A>__{mary screams in pain, as baby plunges the knife into her. baby stabs mary again and again and again. mary lets out a long gurgling scream, then goes silent.}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{..."come maiden," said the rabbit...}
<P>__{(leans down)}
<D>__{...sit on my tail and go with me to my rabbit hutch.}
<A>__{baby, covered in blood, licks the knife clean.}
