<A>__{the room is vacant. the bed is made. the drapes are pulled open. whip walks quietly on the carpet towards the window. the night is clear. quiet. whip takes in the city lights. whip's pov among the glass and steel office buildings, whip spots a church spire. a simple cross is perched on top. whip looks at the church, deep in thought. then suddenly... we hear a hum. the gentle hum of an electric motor. whip turns from the window and scans the room... it's the mini bar refrigerator humming to life. whip stares at the gleaming black box. the whir of the motor seems to get louder. calling whip. beckoning him... whip looks at the fridge. his face is blank, his eyes tell us nothing. then... whip steps toward the box. close on the mini bar. whip swings open the door. whoosh our dark screen lights. colors sparkle as a cadre of tiny liquor bottles glow like jewels in a chest. whip stares at the "glimmering gems" for a long, long time vodka, gin, wine, bourbon. the bottles shimmer amber, crystal, emerald, ruby. whip reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle he gently pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the fridge. he holds up the mini vodka and considers it. now whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the white whiskey. he looks at the bottle once more, then slowly twists the tiny cap back on. with a look of solemn resignation, whip places the frosted mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away. we stay close on the bottle. the camera focuses on the small bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side ever so slowly, slowly. then suddenly... whap!!! in a flash, whip scoops the vodka out of frame!!}
