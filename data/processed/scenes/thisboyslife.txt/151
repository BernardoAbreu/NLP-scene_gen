<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior a & p grocery store night}
<A>__{a few weeks have passed. toby (his elvis hairdo further modified) again prices and stacks food. his face is serious, his manner industrious.}
<L>__{interior dwight and caroline's kitchen afternoon}
<A>__{toby walks in; his elvis hair disappearing. pearl, who is boiling hot dogs, turns:}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{i know something'll make you feel good: that man called you got the scholarship.}
<A>__{toby grits his teeth and clenches both fists victoriously. he's won.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{he said they're gonna give you two thousand three hundred dollars a year and it costs two thousand five hundred dollars... so you gotta come up with the other two hundred. great, huh?}
<P>__{(sympathetic)}
<D>__{i'm making hot dogs i will make one for you. can you put mustard on some bread for us?}
<A>__{toby gets a jar of mustard from a cupboard, but it's empty, so he tosses it on top of the trash can, gets a new jar and starts to open it. dwight enters.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{what're you doing home so earl... oh! toby he got that scholarship two thousand and three hundred dollars!}
<A>__{dwight makes himself a drink, takes two large swallows, then turns to toby.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{hey, leopard. i say, 'hey, leopard.' i know you, leopard i can see those spots you can't change.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{thinks he can go to some fancy prep school and fool everybody. not a chance. i know a thing or two about a thing or two.}
<A>__{toby won't rise to the bait, and dwight falls silent, he, looks around and sees the jar of mustard on top of the trash.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{who threw that away?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{because it was empty.}
<A>__{dwight retrieves the bottle. there are a few streaks of mustard under the neck of the bottle. he holds it close to toby's face.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{empty? that look empty to you?}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{it looks empty to me.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it looks empty to me, too.}
<A>__{dwight pushes the jar against toby's eye, leaving mustard stains on the boy's face.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{look again, hotshot. is it empty?}
<A>__{toby jerks his head away, not answering. dwight slams down the jar of mustard, grabs toby by the back of the hair and forces his face down against the mustard jar.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{dad!}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(to toby)}
<D>__{now. now, mr. big time prep school fucker, is it empty?}
<A>__{toby struggles, but dwight has the strength of anger: trying always to protect his throbbing finger, toby pulls free and jumps up from the table. dwight is too quick for toby, though: he grabs an even bigger handful of hair and forces toby's face down onto the mustard jar again and again. and again. each time he asks if the jar is empty. finally, toby gives up.}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{no, it wasn't empty.}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(lets him go)}
<D>__{all right clean it out.}
<A>__{his face smeared with mustard, toby's expression is murderous. he picks up a knife and scrapes at the mus tard, trying to get up under the neck. he manages to get a few brown and yellow smudges on the knife, which he transfers to the edge of a plate. dwight watches.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{now. was it empty?}
<A>__{slowly he stands up and faces dwight.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{dwight slaps toby across the mouth and the battle is on. as pearl stands frozen, toby lunges at dwight, they grapple and stagger around the room. glass shatters, the kitchen table crashes over, and their feet stamp and shuffle but toby is a wild man. even though he has only one good hand. he lands a blow between dwight's eyes that bangs the man back against the wall. dwight grabs the pan with the hot water from the hotdogs, flings it at toby. most of it misses. again they grapple. toby manages to throw dwight down, then grabs a broom that has fallen to the floor, presses it against dwight's throat, using his good hand and one knee. dwight's mouth gapes wide, his eyes bulge, and he jerks himself frantically trying to dislodge toby, but toby hangs on like grim death. desperate, dwight grabs toby's bandaged hand, bringing it close to his own face, and bites the stump of toby's injured finger as hard as he can. toby and pearl scream simultaneously. pearl in horror, toby in pain. pearl runs into her bedroom. toby reels back in pain, holding his freshly bleeding hand. dwight takes his chance, grabs toby by the throat, forces him down onto the floor and begins to choke the boy. toby's eyelids begin to flutter. he's losing consciousness. wham! from out of nowhere a baseball bat hits dwight flat across the shoulder blades, knocking the breath out of him, stunning him momentarily. as he looks up, we see caroline, one of the baseball bats from the utility porch drawn back, aimed at dwight's head, ready to strike again.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(level)}
<D>__{get away from him or i will kill you.}
<A>__{toby manages to stand up, caroline speaks to both of them.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i got the scholarship and he went nuts. he's crazy, and i'm leaving.}
<P>__{(screams it)}
<D>__{i'm leaving!}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{great. go!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{give me my paper route money, and you'll never have to see my face again.}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(manages a smile)}
<D>__{that money is gone with the wind.}
<P>__{(as toby stares)}
<D>__{that's right. i spent it as you made it. it's gone. poof.}
<A>__{toby starts for dwight again. caroline grabs him, saying, "no. no. no," over and over, literally dragging toby away from dwight. caroline looks at dwight.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{it's not so much that you're disappointing it's that you're consistently disappointing.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{oh, fancy, fancy talk fancy talk for a whore. i know a thing or two about a thing or two. i got friends in this town that tell me things, and i found out some man down at that campaign headquarters found you a job in washington, d.c. gonna run off with him, aren't you, miss whore?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{he's just a friend.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{miss liar. miss whore liar.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i'm leaving, mom. you can leave, too. you don't have to stay here.}
<A>__{caroline takes three full beats and then her face changes. she speaks wonderingly:}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i don't, do i?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{no, you don't.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i could leave with you, couldn't i?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yes, you could!}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{what about me?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i could just walk right out that door, couldn't i?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yes, you could!}
<A>__{caroline takes a deep breath, a weight has been lifted.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{my god... the lightness.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{what about me?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i'm leaving, too.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{oh, dwight, why do you want me to stay? you don't even like me, not really.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{you're not leaving!}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(gentle)}
<D>__{look again, dwight i'm already gone.}
<A>__{dwight makes a terrible noise of frustration and rage, doubles his fists, and starts toward caroline. immediately toby grabs the baseball bat and holds it out, ready to strike, as the two begin to back toward the door.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{... you two've always sided in against me, always thought you were better than me. i tried. i did the best i could. what about me? am i supposed to just crawl off in a ditch someplace and die? i've always been the nigger. everybody's nigger. ever since i was little.}
<A>__{caroline and toby are at the door, run across the yard and down the street. dwight stands in the doorway, yelling:}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{what about me? when is it ever dwight's turn for some consideration? what about me? i will tell you one thing you'll remember me!}
