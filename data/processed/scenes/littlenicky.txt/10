<C>__{dad}
<D>__{in exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? you're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, mr. marino.}

<D>__{you're a good devil, dad.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{and i also happen to be a jets fan.}
<A>__{nicky and dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint sirens. the gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his knees.}
<C>__{gatekeeper}
<D>__{your highness, cassius and adrian have escaped from hell. they went through the fire, and they broke it. i think they took the new york tunnel. i tried to stop them, but they overpowered me, sir.}

<A>__{the gatekeeper stands up.}
<C>__{gatekeeper}
<D>__{thanks for being so understanding, your worship. you're the man. you've always been the man.}
<A>__{dad's eyes glow red as the gatekeeper stands up. two huge boobs grow out of either side of the gatekeeper's head. we only see them from the front for a second. from behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the nipples as he talks to nicky.}
<C>__{gatekeeper }
<P>__{(to nicky)}
<D>__{i'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{coulda been much worse.}
<C>__{gatekeeper}
<D>__{that's what i'm thinkin'...}
<A>__{dad is staring off. he looks shaken.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{this is bad, nicky.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{how bad?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i'm gonna die, nicky. if the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means i will start to deteriorate into nothing.}
<A>__{grandpa lucifer enters.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{what's with all the whoo whoo noises?}
