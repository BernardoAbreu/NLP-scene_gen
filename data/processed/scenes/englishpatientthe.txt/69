<L>__{59. exterior the monastery. hana's garden. morning.}
<A>__{a battered open backed truck comes into the monastery. an italian partisan sits in the back, a shotgun resting on his knees. the truck stops, and caravaggio emerges from the passenger door. he collects some packages from the partisan, including a dead rabbit, and then exchanges a few words with the driver. hana, who's watching all of this from her garden, sees that the driver is a woman. the woman's name is gioia, and caravaggio leans into the window to make his goodbye to her. caravaggio approaches the vegetable garden as hana comes to greet him. he throws her the rabbit, and hurries up the stairs without pausing, clutching the other boxes.}
