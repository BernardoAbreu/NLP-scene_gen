<A>__{kimble sticks gerard's gun into his waist band to balance in the tunnel. he spills around a corner and stops. ahead lies an orb of light. the tunnel ends. the noise is incredible. kimble moves to the end of the tunnel and stops. kimble's pov water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of barkley dam disappearing into a veil of mist below a great cauldron of mists. no rocks. none visible at least. he hears the marshals behind him coming closer. angle marshals gerard and renfro turn the corner. renfro drops into a shooting stance.}

<C>__{gerard}
<D>__{your choice, kimble...}
<A>__{kimble turns his back on the marshals, stares again at the water. slowly he puts his hands over his head. gerard puts up his gun and pulls his handcuffs. he moves through the water toward kimble.}
<C>__{gerard}
<D>__{get down on your knees.}
<A>__{kimble bends slowly, stares down into the falls, hears the footsteps get closer, then does the unthinkable. he jumps.}
