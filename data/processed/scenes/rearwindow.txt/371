<A>__{the alleyway and street intersection, with normal night traffic, but no sign of thorwald. the camera lens pans across and down to the hole being dug by stella. we get an impression of lisa's legs as we go by. the spade comes out of the hole and rests on the side. the camera lens pans up just in time to catch stella turning up to jeff. she throws out a helpless hand and shakes her head. "nothing."}
