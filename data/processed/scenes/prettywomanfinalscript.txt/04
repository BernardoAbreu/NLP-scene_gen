<A>__{end of music. a short silence, and then we hear the song no explanation, performed by peter cetera.}
<C>__{lyrics}
<D>__{you really took me by surprise. you're someone i've needed for a lifetime. your heart was cleverly disguised, and it didn't look that way in my mind. tell me how could it be. i was the last to know. darling, i couldn't read what was in your mind, to turn around and love me, with no explanation. i gave you everything i have. i didn't know that you would take it with sweet consideration. and after all that we've been through, i can't believe it's true until i hear you say. ooh ! i know now, now, now. ah ! no explanation. i gave you everything i have. i didn't know that you would take it.}
<A>__{the music slowly fades out end of credits.}
