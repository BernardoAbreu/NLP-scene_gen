<A>__{sam is sixteen with spiky black hair, a nose ring, two earrings and painted black nails. the song continues with: '...sweep all the pieces under the bed, close all the curtains and cover my head.' sam looks wasted as he climbs out of bed and rummages through his dresser, retrieving an empty bottle of prescription drugs; he tosses the bottle. he walks to a desk where a half built model of a house sits unfinished and squeezes glue into a plastic bag and sniffs it. sam enters the closet and digs into a pile of dirty clothes, pulling out the tie to a robe; he knots it around the closet pole and then twists it once to form a noose. he slips his neck through the noose and lowers his body; though we don't see exactly what he's doing below his neck, it's evident through his jerking arm that he's masturbating.}
