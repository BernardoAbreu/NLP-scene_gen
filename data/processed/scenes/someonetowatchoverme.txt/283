<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.}
<C>__{venza}
<D>__{i get my hostage first. no one's turned loose until i say so.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{let my kid go.}
<C>__{venza}
<D>__{i'm not lettin' no one go.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{get that gun away from his head, or i will keep her from coming in! put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! he's tied up! put him under the table!}
<C>__{venza}
<D>__{don't you fuckin' give orders to me...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{put him under the table or i will stop her from coming in.}
<A>__{mike turns to the window, about to shout.}
<C>__{venza}
<P>__{(to tommy, an order)}
<D>__{under the table.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i will take his place, all right? put the gun to my head.}
<A>__{mike yanks tommy under the table, taking his place in the chair; the cocked gun presses up against mike's temple. angle on ellie: her widened eyes continuing to indicate "beneath the table". close on tommy, on his knees, his hands tied behind his back; emitting a whimper of terror.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{be careful, tommy.}
<A>__{he looks up: spotting her gun, where she'd hidden it for safe keeping, taped securely, just over his head. the front door opens with a slow creak the figure of claire, her dress silhouetted by the moonlight from outside, seen standing in the front hallway.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(frantic)}
<D>__{claire! it's dark. watch your step. come slowly.}
<A>__{angle on tommy: trying desperately to get his hands, tied behind his back, within reach of the gun taped over his head. it's impossible. close on mike: eyes darting to ellie as the figure slowly approaches down the darkened hall, his hand lowering beneath his knees, within reach of tommy, under the table. angle on tommy: in a near headstand, his small hands managing to touch the tape, his fingernails futilely attempting to dig beneath it as the footsteps continue to approach down the darkened hall. angle on the figure: almost at the kitchen door about to step into the light.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{watch your step!}
<C>__{venza}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{what the fuck you doin'?!}
<A>__{tommy's hands are on the gun.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{there's a skateboard in the door!}
<A>__{with a sudden sound of tape "ripping" from under the table. all hell breaks loose. tommy rolls, thrusting the gun into mike's hand as the figure at the door kicks the skateboard, sending it zooming into the room. venza leaps aside and fires, the figure at the door opening fire in return. mike leaps for ellie, knocking her off her chair, rolling fast as the entire kitchen erupts in gunfire. angle on ellie: throwing herself over tommy, bullets "pinging" around mike as he rolls, returning the fire. the pitch black kitchen shudders with bangs and flashes like the fourth of july, mixed with the "whine" of bullets hitting pots and pans, and the sight of bodies hurtling through the dark. the "figure at the door" is firing with both hands, scoring a hit on venza's accomplice, who goes down, wounded, his gun clattering to the floor. he reaches for it, but ellie gets there first, grabbing it with her two hands tied in front of her.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(to tommy)}
<D>__{stay down!}
<A>__{the accomplice is staggering upward as ellie gets to her feet, squaring off in police stance and fires, catching him square between the shoulder blades; he spins, crashing backwards through the glass door swish pan to venza, trying to get out the kitchen window...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{turn around, fuck!}
<A>__{he does, blasted by mike, and the "figure" in the door, simultaneously. he falls out the window, but still has life in him, staggering to his feet, and hit by spotlights from the cars outside. in a sudden barrage, he's hit by crossfire, spinning, lurching finally going down. and then all is quiet. inside the kitchen all sound and movement has suddenly ceased; everyone is a state of shock.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{tommy...!}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i'm all right.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{ellie...}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i'm all right.}
<A>__{the overhead light is snapped on by the "figure" in the doorway revealing it to be koontz. in claire's dress. guns in both hands, still smoking.}
<C>__{koontz}
<P>__{(emphatic)}
<D>__{fuckin' miracle, man.}
<A>__{in the background distant sirens are heard heading toward. the swat squad. camera moving across the faces of ellie, tommy, mike... and koontz; all holding in place. listening to them come.}
<C>__{koontz}
<P>__{(re: the sirens)}
<D>__{told you they'd be here in a few minutes.}
<A>__{the grim humor of it is registered in silence. mike picks up venza's hunting knife from the floor, cutting through the ropes that bind tommy's and ellie's hands; she pulls tommy to her, in a tearful embrace, shielding his face from the ghastly sight of the man, lying dead, on the floor. other people are moving inward, claire among them, clad in an oversized police overcoat looking frail and frightened, shuddering with relief when she sees that all are safe. but there is no mistaking the presence of something else in her eyes. close on claire's face: gazing at mike, his family wrapped in his protective embrace. he looks up, meeting her eyes.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{everyone's all right...?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah. it's all over.}
<A>__{long angle on the room: dimly illuminated by the single light, shed from the opened refrigerator door, as people begin to move awakening to life, and its necessary details, in the aftermath of the crisis.}
