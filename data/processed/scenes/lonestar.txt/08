<A>__{sweat beads the forehead of a thin, tired looking recent immigrant, enrique, as he delivers platters of chile rellenos to a booth. mexican music plays on a jukebox in the b.g. we hold on the booth, where hollis pogue, in his 60s entertains two good old boys }
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{so buddy walks up to the porch and there's old fishbait mchenry, cleanin' the dirt out his toenails with a pocketknife he was the most hygienic of all the mchenrys }
<A>__{the breakfast companions are laughing already }
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{"fishbait," says buddy, in that quiet way of his, "what you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "c'mon out, pooter, they caught us!"}
<C>__{fenton}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{buddy deeds. he had a way.}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{he known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up. "old fishbait," he says, "never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it."}
<A>__{more laughter }
<C>__{fenton}
<D>__{won't be another like him. that boy of his doesn't come near it. you ask me, he's all hat and no cattle}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{fellas }

<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{sam! i was just telling a few about your old man.}
<C>__{fenton}
<D>__{he was a unique individual.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah, he was that.}
<A>__{we sense a little strain when sam has to talk about his father }
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{big day coming up i wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. but he went so unexpected.}
<C>__{fenton}
<D>__{better late than never. korean war hero, sheriff for near thirty years buddy deeds memorial p }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i heard there was a bit of a fuss.}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. danny padilla from the sentinel, that crowd.}
<C>__{fenton}
<D>__{every other damn thing in the country is called after martin luther king, they can't let our side have one measly park?}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{king wasn't mexican, fenton }
<C>__{fenton}
<D>__{bad enough all the street names are in spanish }
<C>__{sam}

<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{right. but nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news }
<C>__{fenton}
<D>__{they just wanted it to be one of theirs }
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{that's not the whole story. the mexicans that know, that remember, understand what buddy was for their people. hell, it was mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.}
<A>__{sam looks to the register where pilar's mother, mercedes cruz, whacks rolls of change apart on the counter. she seems to be avoiding looking toward him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that so?}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{she put it even at three to three, so as the mayor i get to cast the tiebreaker. the older generation won't have any problem with it. they remember how buddy come to be sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.}
<C>__{fenton}
<D>__{tell that one, hollis }
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{hell, everybody heard that story a million times.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'd like to hear it. your version of it.}
<A>__{something about the way sam says it puts hollis on guard.}
<C>__{fenton}
<D>__{go ahead, hollis.}
<B>__{cu hollis}

<C>__{fenton }
<D>__{'57, 1 believe }
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{and the sheriff at the time was big charley wade. charley was one of your old fashioned bribe or bullets kind of sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.}
<A>__{he looks down at the table }
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{it was in here one night, back when jimmy herrera run the place. started right here in this booth.}
<A>__{we pan down to the table, the food has changed. the tortillas are in a straw basket instead of plastic. the jukebox changes to another song and the light dims slightly. a hand with a big masonic ring on one finger appears to lift a tortilla underneath it lie three ten dollar bills. the hand lifts them up and we tilt to see the face of sheriff charley wade, a big, mean redneck with shrewd eyes. it is 1957 }
<C>__{wade}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{this beaner fare doesn't agree with me, but the price sure is right.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{wade sits across from his young deputies, young hollis (30s) and buddy deeds (20s). a chicken fried steak sits untouched in front of buddy. hollis has the anxious look of an errand boy, while buddy is self contained and quietly forceful for his age.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{what's that for?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. people breed like chickens.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{i roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "yo trabajo para jimmy herrera."}
<A>__{wade folds the money and stuffs if in his pocket }
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{you got to keep the wheels greased, son. sheriff does his job right, everybody makes out. now this is gonna be one of your pickups, buddy. first of the month, just like the rent. get the car, hollis.}
<A>__{wade and hollis slide out of the booth to stand.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{i'm not doing it.}
<A>__{hollis stops a few feet away, shocked. wade just stares down at buddy.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{come again?}
<A>__{buddy looks wade in the eye, seemingly unafraid.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{it's your deal. you sweated it out of him, you pick it up.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{there's gonna be some left over for you, buddy. i take care of my boys.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{that's not the pointerior}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{you feeling bad for jimmy? have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. those old boys in ciudad leon }
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{i'm not picking it up.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{you do whatever i say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.}
<A>__{the customers are all watching now, nervous. buddy thinks for a moment, not taking his eyes off wade.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{how 'bout this how 'bout you put that shield on this table and vanish before you end up dead or in jail?}
<A>__{wade rests his hand on his pistol. it is dead silent but for the music on the box.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{you ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{who said anything about shootin' anybody?}
<A>__{buddy has his gun out under the table. he slowly brings it up and lays it flat on the table, not taking his hand off it or his eyes off wade.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{whole different story; isn't it?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{you're fired. you're outta the department.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{there's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, charley. you made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{you little pissant }
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{now or later, charley. you won't have any trouble finding me.}
<A>__{wade feels the people around him waiting for a reaction. he leans close to buddy to croak in a hoarse whisper.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{you're a dead man.}
<A>__{he turns and nearly bumps into hollis. he gives the deputy a shove.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{get the goddamn car. we're going to roderick's.}
<B>__{cu buddy}
<A>__{he watches till the screen door shuts behind them, then holsters his gun and begins to saw at the steak as if nothing had happened. he calls softly }
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{muchacho mas cerveza por favor.}
<A>__{he looks up at somebody and we pan till we see sam, still standing over the booth, listening. we are back in 1995 }
<C>__{hollis }
<D>__{"mas cerveza por favor."}
<C>__{fenton }
<D>__{that buddy was a cool breeze.}
<A>__{we pull back to see hollis and his buddies at the table, eating their lunches as they listen.}
<C>__{fenton}
<D>__{charley wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{we made our collection at roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him. he went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{never heard from him again?}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{not a peep. buddy run the man out of town.}
<C>__{fenton}
<D>__{buddy deeds said a thing, he damn well backed it up. won't be another like him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{so he arrested all of jimmy herrera's people and sent 'em back to the other side?}
<A>__{hollis sees what sam is getting at, grins }
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{oh he come to an accommodation. money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{look, i know you had some problems with your father, and he and muriel well }
