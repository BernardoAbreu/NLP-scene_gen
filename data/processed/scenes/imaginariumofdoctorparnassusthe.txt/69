<L>__{int ext shampoo commercial landscape}
<A>__{the russians charge through the shampoo commercial landscape. no tony.. just slo mo fashion models and soft wafting fabrics and aromatic breezes.}
<C>__{vladimir }
<D>__{where did he go?}
<C>__{piotr }
<D>__{you tell me... it can't be him. he's dead. we killed him.}
<C>__{serge }
<D>__{so why did he run?}
<C>__{gregor }
<D>__{there he is!!}
<A>__{in the distance, tony is hiding behind some billowing fabric. on being spotted, he takes off up a hill. the russians race toward the hill only to crash into a solid wall painted as a landscape with tony frozen in mid stride. looking off to their right they see tony heading up another hill. but as they rush in that direction another wall rises up blocking them. again it is painted with a hill and tony frozen in midstride. a third and fourth wall rise up.. surrounding and trapping the russians. there is a cell door in one wall. like crazy animals they start throwing themselves against the door trying to break it down. it won't budge. while the others batter the door, gregor, who has been somewhat affected by the soft shampoo commercial world, sits quietly in a corner picking pretty flowers. exhausted, the other russians collapse on the ground. gregor gently breathes in the aroma of the flowers and exhales. as he does the door swings open. the other russians gape at him... then barrel out the door. outside is a new, beautiful, landscape the sky dotted with white fluffy clouds. extending from the ground to each cloud is an incredibly long ladder. on each ladder is a person climbing upwards. the russians spot tony. he is already a hundred feet up a ladder and climbing. unfortunately, their way is blocked by an over bright, hyper active, wide eyed sales girl.}
<D>__{sales girl hi! hello! today's special! reach for the clouds! discover your true potential! gift certificates are available at...}
<A>__{the russians roughly shove her aside. as they rush past, gregor pauses, hands her his flowers.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{relax...smell the flowers.}
<A>__{reaching the base of tony's ladder, the russians start climbing. seeing the threat, tony kicks hard and breaks the rungs below him.. setting off a domino effect with more rungs breaking downward towards the russians. snap! crack! rungs break in their grasp.. they fall. the russians land in a tangled heap as the domino effect continues down to the base of the ladder. laughing down at them, tony turns to continue climbing only to see the domino effect heading down from the top of the ladder... towards him.}
<B>__{the ladder completely separates in two.}
<A>__{tony struggles to maintain his balance and somehow manages to get his feet on the two halves of a broken rung. then, as if he were on giant stilts, starts to stride away. the russians chase after him but, his giant strides leave them far behind. smugly, tony looks back just as one of the legs of his ladder snags on a fallen log. he loses his balance... and plunges hundreds of feet earthward. from nowhere, anton (still dressed as a fat woman) appears.. running to catch the plummeting tony. he does and whomp!!.. is flattened. knocked out cold. tony is unscathed.. his fall broken by anton's padding. but, the russians arrive, grab tony, start to beat him up.}
<C>__{serge}
<D>__{you thieving scumbag! we break every bone in your body!}
<A>__{they scrawl strange symbols on tony's forehead.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{no! wait! i can explain! give me a chance!}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{we want our money or you die again! this time for good!}
<A>__{anton struggles to his feet.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{stop it! l leave him alone!}
<A>__{the russians turn and, thinking anton is a fat, bossy, middle aged woman, hesitate.}
<C>__{anton }
<D>__{stand b back! i'm warning you!}
<A>__{foolishly, he whips off his wig and assumes a manly martial arts pose. the russians look at each other. then, utterly ignoring anton, turn their attention back to beating tony. gregor walks calmly over to anton who is in attack mode.}
<C>__{gregor}
<P>__{(bending down and picking}
<D>__{a flower, he offers it to}
<P>__{anton)}
<D>__{relax. smell the flowers.}
<A>__{confused, anton takes the flower, sniffs and then... gregor floors him with a powerful punch on the nose meanwhile, the russians have a noose around tony's neck and have looped the rope over a tree branch. tony struggles to pull out the metal pipe he keeps on a string around his neck. he gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when... ... the ground erupts and a giant london policeman's helmet rises up (we are talking 20 feet tall)and revolves revealing dr. parnassus' carved and painted face beneath. the mouth drops open and a great red tongue rolls out like a welcoming red carpet. from inside the giant mouth a smiling policeman beckons the russians to come on in.. the terrified russians let go of the lynching rope. tony drops to the ground and, with a whistle, the brass pipe flies out of his mouth. behind the russians a painted backdrop unfurls..it reads "join the fuzz.. we love violence".. and a chorus line of long legged girls in mini skirted police outfits appear high kicking a snappy song and dance number. the astonished russians don't know what the fuck is going on. suddenly, a friendly old woman's voice is heard shouting something in russian. spinning around, the russians see an old baboushka (russian grandmother) outside a tumble down cottage waving gaily to them. a stunned pause. then, pell mell, they rush to her.}
<C>__{russians }
<D>__{mama! mama! help! save us!}
<A>__{as they run toward her they get smaller and smaller. she lifts her skirts and all four disappear underneath. and then.. boom!.. a muffled explosion balloons the skirts outward. smoke spews out from below. straightening her skirt, the baboushka looks up, and pulls off her head revealing mr.nick's tiny head poking out of the collar. he smiles smugly. the giant policeman dr. parnassus registers disappointment and, like a balloon rapidly deflating, spins off into the sky sending up a cloud of dust obscuring everything. the dust clears and tony and anton find themselves in a desolate, empty landscape. nowhere. nothing.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{did you see me!! i almost reached the clouds! i could have...it was incredible...i was almost there...}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{over a distant rise the wagon appears, pulled by the horses. anton drags tony, babbling and stumbling, towards it.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i made my choice and i climbed... i felt so much potential. i could have done anything. i have to have another chance...another go...i need this...}
