<A>__{poe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by miss sloviak's high heels and scores a rye krisp. crabtree, returning with a pair of drinks, tiptoes around him, finds miss sloviak chatting with a trim man in his 50's.}

<D>__{walter! i see you've met my friend.}

<P>__{(taking her drink)}
<D>__{walter's been telling me the most fascinating things about marilyn monroe and. ..who was it?}
<C>__{walter gaskell}
<D>__{joe dimaggio. simply put, antonia, it' s my contention that their marriage tapped into the very id of american popular culture. joe dimaggio represented, metaphorically speaking, the husband as slugger.. and, though it may be controversial, i personally believe every woman, in some way, desires to be marilyn monroe.}
<C>__{miss sloviak}
<D>__{oh, i couldn't agree more.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{grady works his way through the crowd, spies walter, and changes course. directly ahead is an oddly commanding man ("q"). from the behavior of the people in his vicinity it's clear he is someone of interest. presently, he is putting the make on hannah green.}
<C>__{q}
<D>__{and while my latest has been on the new york times bestseller list for 40 weeks, i can't help but lament that my first book, which contains what i consider my finest writing, was remaindered in less than five. so, i find myself conflicted.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{ask him if he's conflicted about his house in the hamptons.}

<D>__{hello.. .professor.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{q,. hannah's had two stories published in the paris review. you'd best dust off the 'a' material for her.}
<A>__{as grady moves off, he sees poe sniffing, and goes the other way, heading directly into the crosshairs of a mah in tweed, who is talking to another, shorter man.}
<C>__{man in tweed}
<P>__{(to short man)}
<D>__{a supermarket for the mind, my ass. i'm telling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob laundry. have you ever been to davenport, iowa? let me tell you, they need a 30,000 square foot bookstore like they need another goddamn cow.}

<D>__{grady was there for arsonist's daughter,}
<A>__{the short man blinks, impulsively takes grady's hand.}
<C>__{short man}
<D>__{douglas triddly, amherst. i kid you not when i say arsonist's daughter belongs in the pantheon of late twentieth century fiction. i've had it on my graduate studies syllabus three years running.}
