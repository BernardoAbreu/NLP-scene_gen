<A>__{fait and daria push the display table aside as miles shoves equipment bags through the hole in the floor. fait opens the leather bag, revealing tools, a tripod, three steel cables and a long, rectangular box. miles grabs a high tech drill. begins boring a hole high up on the vault door. fait hands daria the tripod to set up, while he uncoils the steel cables, attaches them to the wheel on the vault door. then opens the rectangular box and lifts out what's inside. a surface to air missile. fait sets it on the tripod. miles, the hole drilled, picks up the cylinder he'd had slung over his shoulder. pulls out a pressurized metal canister of liquid nitrogen. miles injects the nitrogen into the hole. a crackling sound as the super low temp liquid spreads out inside the vault door. the outside frosts over. fait finishes attaching the free ends of the cables to clips on the sam. final checks of the rig.}
