<L>__{interior black palace throne room day}
<A>__{adrian and cassius are playing darts. they're aiming for people's faces that are coming through the wall.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{i knew it. he's finally retiring.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{i've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.}
<A>__{he throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead.}
<C>__{human dartboard}
<D>__{aaaah!}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{if the old man picks me to take over hell, i will keep the torture going twenty four seven. no breaks.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{well dad says it's the breaks that make the torture. you have to let people feel a sense of relief.}
<A>__{cassius whips a dart which hits one of the human dartboards in the eye.}
<C>__{human dartboard}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaaaah!}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{then again, the beauty of dad retiring is what he says doesn't matter anymore.}
<A>__{cassius pulls out the dart. the eye comes with it.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{i will take that.}
<A>__{cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it. thwack! it splatters like a grape.}
<C>__{human dartboard}
<D>__{was that really necessary?}
<A>__{nicky enters sheepishly.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{hey, how's daddy's little girl doing today?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{good, thanks.}
<A>__{cassius snaps his fingers in nicky's face.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{hey. hey. hey. wanna mind wrestle?}
<A>__{cassius' eyes start glowing red.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{actually, i will take a rain check on0}
<A>__{nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible force.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{got ya!}
<C>__{nicky}
<P>__{(picking up his head)}
<D>__{yes, you got me...}
<A>__{nicky's head slams back down again.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{got ya, again!}
<C>__{nicky}
<P>__{(picking head up)}
<D>__{got me for sure, yes...}
<A>__{he grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the head.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{got ya! now here's the big finish...}
<A>__{nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his own crotch.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{oh no. please cassius...}
<A>__{nicky's hand is being possessed. it gets closer and closer until it latches on to nicky's crotch.}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{aaaaah.}
<A>__{cassius concentrates even harder, making nicky twist his own hand. nicky screams even louder. adrian smiles. they don't notice that dad, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small devil horns), enters behind them.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{what are you boys doing?}
<A>__{cassius releases nicky's hand.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{nothing, dad. just re arranging the furniture.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{cassius, didn't i tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{i forgot.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{maybe this will help you remember.}
<A>__{dad's eyes flash red and cassius punches himself hard in the nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the floor. dad gives nicky a wink. nicky smiles. dad has an air of confidence and power.}
<C>__{dad }
<D>__{now everybody sit down.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{hey, dad, i'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. i really think it's a masterpiece.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.}
<A>__{he leads the boys to the throne area. we see outside the window the peeper staring in sexily. dad looks, shakes his head. just then, the bird appears and attacks him. dad closes the curtains. nicky, adrian and cassius sit on little stools at the foot of his throne. dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at his three sons.}
<C>__{dad }
<D>__{my dad, your granddad, lucifer, was thrown out of heaven by g d and rules here in hell for ten thousand years. and after this ten thousand years had passed, he decided to abdicate his throne...}
<A>__{confused, nicky sheepishly raises his hand.}
<C>__{dad }
<D>__{...to step aside.}
<P>__{(nicky lowers his hand)}
<D>__{...and let me become the ruler of hell. this, as some of you might know, is my ten thousandth year as prince of darkness. so i think the time has come to discuss who will succeed me.}
<A>__{jimmy the demon walks in.}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{knock, knock.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{yes, jimmy.}
<A>__{he whispers in dad's ear.}
<C>__{dad }
<D>__{no, no, that's not what i said. he can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<P>__{(turning to leave)}
<D>__{oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up hitler's ass at four o'clock.}
<A>__{dad nods, and jimmy shuffles out. dad turns his attention back to his sons.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{this was a very difficult decision, because i have three wonderful sons. i mean, adrian, so smart, so ruthless. and cassius, so strong, so tough. and nicky, so...so...}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{don't worry about coming up with anything. it's cool.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{such a sweet boy. but after much thought and careful consideration, i've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be...me.}
<C>__{cassius and adrian}
<P>__{(dumbfounded)}
<D>__{what!?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{hallelujah.}
<A>__{they all look at nicky.}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{i mean...tough break.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{the important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. and i don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. you need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{dad! this is hoyashit.}
<A>__{dad glares. cassius goes flying back. one of the human dartboards laughs. cassius whips a dart and hits him in the tongue. jimmy enters and points at his watch.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{right. right. send him in.}
<P>__{(to the boys)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, boys. i've got to get back to work.}
<A>__{nicky, cassius and adrian start filing out. adrian stops.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{you sure about this decision, dad?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i'm telling you, pal, it's the right thing to do.}
<A>__{hitler (in a french maid's outfit), is being brought in by jimmy. they head towards the closet. inside the closet is a crate of pineapples. hitler picks out a relatively small one. dad shakes his head "no." dad walks over to the closet. hitler picks out a really big pineapple. dad nods "yes." hitler sadly hands it to dad. jimmy bends hitler over and as dad raises the fruit... close on hitler's eyes as the pineapple's jammed up his ass.}
<C>__{hitler}
<D>__{holy schnit!!}
