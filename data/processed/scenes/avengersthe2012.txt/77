<A>__{iron man lifts his palm, that is being crushed, and he fires a blast at thor’s face it does nothing to thor so he head butts him. thor headbutts him back. iron man flies back, coming to a stop before launching himself at thor. iron man throws thor into a broken tree. thor then stands and the two go at it for a bit longer a fist fight. thor summons his hammer about to slam down on the chest of tony but iron man ditches, causing thor to fall. behind the rising thor, iron man swoops in and punches him. they get ready to sends blows at each other until cap’s shield ricochets off both their chest.}
