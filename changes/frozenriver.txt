Her breath is visible in the cold morning air. Her bare feet rest on the cold ground. Her 1970's rusted out TRAILER HOME SITS in front of her on CINDER BLOCKS AT A SLIGHT TILT. Beside it, a small SHED and behind it the CONCRETE FOUNDATION FOR A HOUSE. Around her, the yard is littered with junk: a rusted ski lift chair, the front end of a Plymouth Duster and a SMILING DUCK Kiddie Ride. Beyond the yard, flat, winterbare land. After a moment, a lanky boy of 15, her son, TROY, JR., leans out the trailer door.}
