<L>__{int norton's office day (1966)}
<A>__{...so do the bullets. norton is riveted to the door. for every key, he loads another bullet. methodical and grim. he gets the final bullet in just as the right key slams home. the door bursts open. men muscle in. somebody shouts. troopers dive in all directions as norton raises the gun and jams it under his chin. his head snaps back as the wall goes red. his swivel chair does a slow half turn and creaks to a final stop. troopers rise slowly, gazing in horror.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{i like to think the last thing that went through his head...other than that bullet...was to wonder how the hell andy dufresne ever got the best of him.}
<A>__{push slowly to the wall to reveal mrs. norton's framed sampler trickling blood and brains...and we get our final bible lesson for today: "his judgment cometh and that right soon."}
