<L>__{interior mountain crack chimney}
<A>__{gabe, wedged near the top of the crack, is ready to dig through the snow but he hears the sound, muffled and distant, of kynette talking. gabe strains to hear a bad time to come up? might be.}
<L>__{exterior buttress side}
<A>__{maggie, tired, gets near the top and collapses, resting for a moment, her arms on the edge maggie looks up and is very surprised to see kynette, standing over her, smiling, his gun aimed down at her.}
<C>__{kynette}
<D>__{rotten weather for a climb, huh?}
<P>__{(aims barrel)}
<D>__{i have two questions i'd like to trouble you with. ready?}
<A>__{maggie stares up, frozen whatever she was expecting, it wasn't this.}
<C>__{kynette}
<D>__{this first one's easy. do you know a man named gabe walker?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(breathless, scared)}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{kynette}
<D>__{you don't know either? i am sorry. that was question number two.}
<P>__{(lowers barrel)}
<D>__{thanks for your time.}
<A>__{as kynette tightens his finger around the trigger }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{appears he completes his run toward kynette's back and kicks him over the edge }
<B>__{kynette}
<A>__{goes flying over maggie, his shots going wild but he catches himself on the rock and comes to a painful but safe halt after skidding down ten feet }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{yanks maggie to her feet and onto the top. maggie gets a good look at gabe his clothes are slashed, he's covered with cuts, and coated with slime and dirt from the crack. he looks like he's just spent a week in hell. gabe doesn't react to her reaction he just grabs her hand and runs.}
<B>__{qualen}
<A>__{chooses this moment to show up at the opposite edge he fires and automatic burst at gabe and maggie.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{come on }
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{where? }
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{gabe jumps on a spot in the snow over the crack, caving it in gabe falls two feet into the crack maggie's pov gabe has grabbed, and is hanging from, a rope anchored to a piton on the edge of the rock. he's also glowering up at maggie a little impatiently.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{today, goddamit!}
<A>__{gabe rappels down the rope into the darkness.}
<B>__{maggie}
<A>__{hesitates she's still getting used to the idea of being shot at }
<B>__{kynette}
<A>__{woozy but recovered, has climbed up he runs toward the opening, firing his gun }
<B>__{maggie}
<A>__{drops into the relative safety of the crack and rappels downward. maggie reaches rope's end thirty feet down, as the vertical passage again becomes diagonal. gabe is there waiting.}
<B>__{kynette}
<A>__{reaches the edge of the crack and fires down into it gabe and maggie further down bullets are ricocheting all over gabe throws himself over maggie to shield her.}
<B>__{kynette}
<A>__{can't see what he's shooting at, so he mercifully stops. seeing the rope, he bends down to climb after them gabe and maggie further down gabe reaches up and tugs gently on the rope twice kynette reaching for the rope which is tied in a standard climber's slipknot and comes undone with a final tug the rope, freed of the piton, falls down, but kynette firmly grabs hold of the end }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{feels the rope go taut he yanks the rope down hard }
<B>__{kynette}
<A>__{gets more pull than he counted on and takes a head first fall into the crack, disappearing with a scream qualen has just arrived in time to see this }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{looks over as kynette bounces past him, a few feet away the rope goes slack in his hand as kynette falls below. up above qualen in frustration, fires a burst straight down into the crack gabe and maggie in the crack chimney gabe and maggie move laterally through the crack now about thirty feet from where they started, so ricochets are a serious but decreasing problem. the crack narrows from five to three feet. gabe edges maggie down into it, and along a ledge moving to the side.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{this way.}
<P>__{(off maggie's look)}
<D>__{i like the outside of the mountain better too, but }
<A>__{gabe and maggie move along the ledge }
<B>__{qualen}
<A>__{is still at the edge of the crack stymied. he's definitely not climbing down after them he pulls back from the edge. in the crack chimney gabe and maggie find a comparative point of comfort a toe sized ledge. maggie is moving ahead of gabe.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{stop.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{we can't }
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{i need to stop.}
<A>__{exhausted, gabe braces himself against the wall.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(looks at maggie)}
<D>__{i'm glad to see you but christ, i wish you hadn't come.}
