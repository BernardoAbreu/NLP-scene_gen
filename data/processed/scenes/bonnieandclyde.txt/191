<L>__{ext: car on the moss farm. a dirt path near the barn. day.}
<A>__{it is pouring rain, middle of the afternoon, bonnie and clyde are inside the car, sitting. they have lived so much in cars that they tend to still spend much of their time in it rather than in a room. there they are themselves.}
<L>__{interior car.}
<A>__{bonnie is in the back seat, her legs wrapped in a plaid blanket, writing poetry. she looks like elizabeth barrett browning. with one essential difference her arm is in a sling and she is wearing bandages on the shoulder. clyde is in the front seat, reading a newspaper. he is also partially bandaged. on the dashboard is a box of ginger snaps which he eats while he reads. they look domestic.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{want a ginger snap, bonnie?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(busy, absorbed)}
<D>__{no, hum umm.}
<P>__{(then she realizes}
<D>__{his nice gesture and}
<P>__{smiles warmly at him)}
<D>__{but thanks anyway, clyde.}
<P>__{(she takes it all in,}
<D>__{her situation, and}
<P>__{looks content and cozy)}
<D>__{it's real nice here, just the two of us like this.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(more interested in his paper)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<P>__{(something in the paper catches his interest)}
<D>__{look here, honey, remember this?}
<A>__{he holds up the paper; there is one of the photos from the motel, the one showing bonnie smoking. she looks up at it with mild interest.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{yeah, at the motel.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(studying the picture)}
<D>__{you sure don't resemble that no more.}
<A>__{close up bonnie. she doesn't. she has become totally fragile, the essence of herself. she is writing on a pad. clyde and bonnie.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{what you writin' this time?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(intensely)}
<D>__{i'm writing a poem about us. i'm writing our story.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(this appeals to his ego)}
<D>__{oh, are you? let's hear it. if it's good, i will mail it in to the law and it'll be printed in all the papers again.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{just let me finish this line.}
<A>__{she does so. clyde munches a cookie.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{okay, here it is.}
<A>__{close up. bonnie as she reads intensely. at the beginning of this montage, the camera remains on her face. behind her we see the rain on the window.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"the story of bonnie and clyde" you've heard the story of jesse james of how he lived and died: if you're still in need of something to read here's the story of bonnie and clyde. now bonnie and clyde are the barrow gang i'm sure you all have read how they rob and steal and those who squeal are usually found dying or dead. they call them cold hearted killers; they say they are heartless and mean; but i say this with pride, that i once knew clyde when he was honest and upright and clean. but the laws fooled around, kept taking him down and locking him in a cell, till he said to me, "i will never be free so i will meet a few of them in hell." the road was so dimly lighted; there were no highway signs to guide; but they made up their minds if all roads were blind, they wouldn't give up till they died.}
