<D>__{whyn't you bed down closer to the fire, boy?}
<A>__{martin is a bit surprised as ethan takes the blanket and spreads it near the saddle making the saddle serve as a pillow. then ethan tosses a few more heavy pieces of dry wood on the fire, making it blaze up.}

<D>__{maybe i'm gettin' like mose harper my bones is cold tonight...}

<D>__{you all settled an' comfortable now?}
<A>__{martin just grunts and snugs deeper into his blanket. ethan nods his satisfaction sure martin isn't going to change positions. then he takes off his hat and boots and uses them to complete the dummy. he picks up his rifle then and quietly walks out of the camp.}
