<A>__{seams bend under the strain, rivets pop...}
<B>__{straining machines send scalding geysers of steam into the}
<A>__{corridors...and suddenly the floor gives way beneath willie! she leaps up and grabs an overhanging pipe and swings to the firm ground. jones leads the way toward the swamp, with willie behind him, and beck covering the rear. they reach the end of the corridor and willie and jones turn into the swamp annex. willie hits the door opener. rrrrrr it doesn't budge. the pressure has bent the door frame.}
<B>__{beck arrives}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{it's jammed!}
<A>__{immediately beck backtracks to the corridor and pulls a hand held spreader like a "jaws of life" from the wall. he turns back to the swamp when a black scaly arm suddenly}
<B>__{bursts through the wire mesh of the machine floor and pulls}
<A>__{beck against the wire! it is the dejesus creature. his head held in place by the powerful arm, beck looks almost directly into the dark eyes of the creature. its gill like slits flare. its mouth opens and we see a flash of its razor sharp teeth. before beck can move the leech like appendage ruptures the steel mesh and its razor sharp proboscis plunges like a knife for beck's face. at the last instant beck move his head and the proboscis slams into the steel mesh. the mesh loosens the creature's grip and beck manages to reach a mining drill from the tools on the wall. as the appendage starts to strike again beck buries the whining tool into the creature's tentacle and breaks free. scooping up the spreader beck rushes to the swamp door where jones and willie are trying vainly to hand crank the door open.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{where the hell've you been?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i got hung up! try this!}
<A>__{willie stands back and beck thrusts the spreader into the tiny crack in the door the hand crank had made. with jones' help the two men force open the door and all three rush inside the swamp. beck closes the door behind them. the recorded female voice intones: "five minutes to implosion." and we feel it happening:}
<B>__{the bilge water on the floor of the swamp ripples with the vibrations the walls shake the huge metal suits rock like clothes on a clothes line. one falls and crashes into the water}
<A>__{jones throws open the control panel and grabs the red handled emergency air switch, but he can only move it half way! it is jammed by the pressure.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{it won't go!}
<A>__{willie grabs it with him, but even together it is not enough. the handle breaks off in their hands! steam jets whip down on them from above! the water at their feet now boils from vibration! the female voice intones: "four minutes..."}
<B>__{beck turns and sees the suits in the lock}
<A>__{he grabs willie and pushes her toward the lock where her suit hangs.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{the suits! get in them!}
<A>__{willie moves quickly but jones doesn't.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{the suits! are you crazy! how're we going to get to the surface?}
<A>__{beck yanks open the equipment locker revealing tanks of}
<B>__{compressed air and deflated container transporters.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{like this.}
<A>__{he looks up at jones who grins with renewed hope and they begin pulling the equipment out.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{get them in the lock!}
<A>__{jones and beck drag the tanks and the parachute like container transporters to the lock. on willie she climbs into her suit and activates her generator. instantly her vital signs spring to life around the perimeter of her helmet. the female voice trembles from the vibrations..."three minutes...to...implosion..." beck and jones throw the last of the supplies onto the elevator and beck holds out the seismic tool jones tried to arm himself with earlier. he takes the tool from beck and sticks it in the vest of his wet suit. then suddenly he sees that there are only two suits in the lock. beck will have to wait on his to move along the track to the lock.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{your suit, becky!}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{just get in yours!}
<A>__{jones climbs onto the lock platform and slides into his suit. beck hits the suit track button and his suit begins moving along the track toward the lock. a suit turns the corner from the storage room followed by one labeled beck. beck looks at the walls, they're shaking harder. he moves along the suit rack when suddenly the creature bursts from behind the suits shattering them like an explosion! a huge}
<B>__{tentacle hurls toward beck like a spear.}
<A>__{beck ducks just in time, grabbing a fire ax and chopping off the appendage. another tentacle jabs for beck.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{but it is too late. it knocks the ax from beck's hand and sends him to the floor. beck looks up at the lock in time to see jones seal himself into his suit.}
<D>__{jones radio i'm in.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{go! willie radio no!}
<B>__{the creature approaches beck}
<A>__{beck looks at the others one last time.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{go, now! that's an order!}
<A>__{jones hits the elevator button and the lock closes as the elevator sends them down without beck. beck stands and arms himself with a mining drill, which he swings at the creature driving it back. as beck gets the upper hand, the creature turns its hideous face and beck freezes. there attached to the back of the creature's head is the grotesque face of dejesus! dejesus' eyes suddenly blink. he's still alive! his lips tremble in agony.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{kill me...kill me!}
<A>__{beck, momentarily stopped by the face, lunges forward with the drill and embeds it in the side of the creature. as the creature falls back hurt, beck looks up at the lock elevator as it returns it is empty the others have made it out! his suit continues down the track and stops in the lock. he still has to make it, if he can just get there! the recorded female voice sounds: "one minute to implosion..." beck races to the lock and starts to climb into the suit. his arms slide into place, his legs drop into the heavy metal shell and as he seals up the back he activates the generator. beck's pov. his vital signs light up around the perimeter of his helmet, but he sees something else the creature charges toward the lock its arm reaches out to yank beck out of the elevator! instinctively, beck swings his motorized leg into the creature's snarling mouth, knocking it backwards and stunning it long enough for beck to hit the elevator button. but it doesn't work!}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{he hits again, still nothing! the recorded female voice..."nineteen, eighteen..." her voice begins to quiver.}
<B>__{beck pounds on the button and looks up just as the creature}
<A>__{dives for him, its huge scaly hand grabbing him around beck's leg! close on the elvator button beck pounds it one last time and nnnnnnnnnnnn! the lock closes, crushing the creature as it flushes beck}
<B>__{outside seconds before the entire structure collapses with}
<A>__{implosion and suddenly explodes in a huge shudder of energy! underwater later whoosh! a parachute like container transporter zoom toward the surface. a heavy suited crew member flashes past us. its helmet light pierces the darkness, then disappears. a moment later another transporter follows, racing out of the darkness after the first. beck's pov we see the vital signs lit in a ring around his helmet. the depth gauge races past with blinding speed as he moves closer to the surface. willie's pov she tilts her head upwards. she snaps off her light and sees instead of black, a lighter gray, then suddenly faint traces of light in the water above her. at first it seems like her eyes are playing tricks on her, then we see it again a glimmer of light.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{light. beck, i see light!}
<B>__{on beck}
<A>__{he follows her look. light is coming fast, brightening as they rise. the led numbers inside their helmets click off..."125, 100, 75..."}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{wait till you reach thirty five before you blow your suit...}
<C>__{willie's voice}
<D>__{roger.}
<A>__{willie's pov her numbers count down "....70, 60, 50, 40..."}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{ejecting.}
<A>__{she yanks at the handle on the chest plate and whoosh! the plate bursts open and reveals a second interior handle. her hand gropes for it.}
<B>__{sunlight is streaming down through the water as she rushes upward.}
<A>__{whoosh! the helmet and torso of the suit are blown open as she pulls the second lever detaching her from the balloons. no longer oxygen supported or being pulled upward, willie frees herself from the heavy suit and swims to the surface.}
<B>__{suddenly she breaks the surface and catches a glimpse of the}
<A>__{sun, dazzling through a million droplets of water as a huge}
<B>__{swell carries her up even higher.}
<A>__{then she's underwater again, struggling desperately to pull the tab on the life jacket around her neck. suddenly a male hand grabs the tab for her and pulls. she looks up at beck.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{we made it!}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{where's jones?}
<A>__{holding onto each other willie and beck ride a swell. at the crest we see jones in the trough below, face down. beck breaks away from willie and swims through the waves to reach jones. reaching him beck pulls his face out of the water and inflates his life jacket.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{is he okay?}
<A>__{beck lays jones head back against the life jacket. for a moment. jones seems lifeless, then his eyes blink and squint against the sunlight. beck turns back to willie and as he and jones ride the next crest he gives her the "thumbs up."}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(jubilant)}
<D>__{the sun! the sun!}
<A>__{jones looks at beck and grins.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{what happened to that typhoon?}
<A>__{calm sea later beck, willie and jones cling to each other as they search the horizon.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{are you sure you saw something?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{how many times i got to tell you. i saw a ship.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{well, why haven't they answered our flares?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{we'll fire one more, that leaves us one last one.}
<A>__{beck pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark water. the light fades, willie looks at jones.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{are you okay, jonesy?}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{tip top, willie...tip top.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(testing him)}
<D>__{who's the best power forward in the nba...jameson?}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(tired, but with fight)}
<D>__{jameson? who are you trying to con...?}
<A>__{they both manage a weak laugh, then beck sees something.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i will be damned. look!...a flare!}
<A>__{as a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just fading against the sky.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{it saw us!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{answer them and quit kicking me!}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i'm not touching you!}
<A>__{whoooooooosh! beck fires another flare into the sky. as the flare arcs downward, willie feels another bump and for the first time sees the sharks circling them.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{no...no, no, no.}
<A>__{the sharks tighten the circle as the flare fades.}
