<D>__{what happened to them?}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{try to attack plexor head on, this is what happens. because of you, there will be millions more.}

<C>__{rush}
<D>__{flynn. you think i'm sinclair's flunky, but i'm not.}
<A>__{flynn pauses. rush speaks low, so x net captives can't hear.}

<C>__{krod}
<D>__{yeah, we're sorry?}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{we were just doing a job, we had no way of knowing the truth.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{no way at all.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{flynn, i was wrong about you. you've been doing the right thing in here. plexor has to be shut down. sinclair has to be exposed.}
