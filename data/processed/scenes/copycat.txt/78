<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior hillside dawn}
<A>__{all night festival revellers dance across the skyline, of glorious misty green hills, hand in hand. the camera moves down, across verdant meadows, until we arrive at the bottom of the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway. a few festival up all night revelers, looking down at a new crime scene, where three blue and whites are parked, plus a number of unmarked cars.}
<B>__{ruben arrives in a taxi.}
<A>__{as he moves past the ever present susan we thread through the scene to find m.j. m.j. takes one look at ruben's stubble, his yesterday's slept in clothes, and she turns away. before ruben can catch up with her, nikko approaches.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{up all night with a sick friend.}
<A>__{nikko's face is tight with anger.}
<C>__{nikko}
<D>__{you dumb son of a bitch! you don't even know how to treat a woman.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{who? m.j.? hey, nikko, explain to me why she gave you the boot...}
<A>__{he moves to m.j. who stands beside the dead body of the woman we last saw strapped to a table. the plastic bag is now tied tight around her neck. she has been posed beneath a sign that says "no dumping". the usual technicians, photographers, doc, the coroner, etc.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{is niccoletti assigned here?}
<C>__{m.j.}
<P>__{(angry about it)}
<D>__{quinn decided we should form a task force they're all one case, now. he wants all the senior detectives on it...}
<P>__{(to doc)}
<D>__{she wasn't killed here.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{not likely.}
<A>__{m.j. is kneeling, inspecting everything here; ruben kneels beside her... to ruben...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{tell me what you see.}
<A>__{he inspects the dead girl's fingernails.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{she didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails. i'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{what about her arms?}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{needle marks, fresh, here. look at this...}
<A>__{nikko appears, looming over her...}
<C>__{nikko}
<D>__{probably so stoned she never knew what got her. like goetz's sick friend. right goetz?}
<A>__{they ignore him. m.j. stands...}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{she's blue as hell. no marks on her neck. asphyxiated? not the same no ligature marks. outdoors...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{look at her legs.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{after she was dead.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{she was dragged up here from the road, you can see the tracks. she was already dead or unconscious. let's get plaster casts on any all footprints.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{if this is just the dump site, where did he do the job? where did he pick her up?}
<C>__{nikko}
<D>__{doped up kids all over town. park was full of them last night. very easy pickin'. goetz's type.}
<A>__{ruben hits him, nikko reflexively throws a punch that grazes ruben. everybody stops in astonishment. m.j. steps between them. ready to get physical herself; they settle...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing? the mouth and the haircut are right down there, thank god they didn't see that.}
<A>__{down below, susan and the haircut are interviewing festival of lovers.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{niccoletti, they're on the wrong side of the tape, you want to push them back? now.}
<A>__{nikko trots off to susan and the haircut. m.j. gestures for ruben, now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip, to follow her back to the cars. as they move more slowly down the hillside to their cars...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{ruben, my god, i ought to put you on report.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{you're right. i can't stand that bastard. sorry.}
<P>__{(getting back to work)}
<D>__{this is something new. not the same guy, that's for sure.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{yeah, everything's different.}
<A>__{but she seems unhappy... to techs standing by:}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{get the pictures, and casts of footprints.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{look at him, grandstanding...}
<A>__{nikko is talking to susan schiff...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<A>__{that's all we need... she strides toward them...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{detective niccoletti?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what's this about the boston strangler, m.j.?}
<A>__{m.j. looks at nikko. he should know better. she's also thinking: is this a good thing to have the media announce at this point or not?}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{hey, susan i'm sorry, you're on the wrong side of the tape. we're still trying to find any footprints or tire marks and we don't want to chew up the ground, okay? i will talk to you later.}
<P>__{(to nikko)}
<D>__{you, too.}
<A>__{she's got susan outside the tape...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the boston strangler? this is the fourth, is that correct?}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{we're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...}
<A>__{she is getting into her car; ruben jumps in on the other side. susan races for her silver audi...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{ruben, put the light on...}
<A>__{from outside the car as they drive away we see ruben's arm clap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car. m.j. switches it on... a chase ensues. susan has a faster car, but m.j. is a better driver. stomach dropping hills, trolley cars, the corkscrew turns of lombard street, all the familiar san francisco chase scenes.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{now listen up, ruben. you never, never, never mess with somebody inside the case!}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<A>__{excuse me ?! what do}
<D>__{you...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{you damn well better start working on that impulse control. a woman who is implicated in this case? someone who's practically a piece of evidence ?}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{it's against your rules that i try to help a witness who's scared shitless? who's...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{the woman's unstable. you could wind up with a harassment charge.}
<A>__{anything . you're like some horny}
<D>__{little teenager.}
<A>__{m.j. takes another two wheel corner. in the rear view mirror, m.j. watches susan lose control of her car as she tries to make a tight turn, m.j. smiles in contempt.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{anybody who's ever watched tv knows about that corner.}
<A>__{having lost susan, m.j. slows down to a normal speed.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{everybody could see you unshaved, same clothes from yesterday, reeking of sex.}
<A>__{ruben's eye brows lift. she peels into the hq parking lot and jumps out.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<P>__{(going away)}
<D>__{park the car. call the lab. get doc to lean on the coroner for a really fast prelim on the sperm.}
<A>__{ruben gets out of the car to cross to the driver's side...}
<C>__{m.j. }
<D>__{when you get it, call me.}
<A>__{ruben look after her, a smile of delight on his face.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{she loves me.}
