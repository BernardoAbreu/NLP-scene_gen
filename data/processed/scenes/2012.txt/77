<L>__{exterior santa monica airport los angeles morning}
<A>__{the limo crashes through a gate onto the tarmac, coming to a stop in front of a twin engine cessna.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{damn it! where's the pilot?}
<A>__{kate turns to gordon.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{gordon, you know how to fly.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i... had a couple lessons...}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{did you cover taking off?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{that's good enough for me.}
<A>__{they start running, when jackson remembers something and heads back to the limo. he grabs his knapsack from the front seat fumbling to zip his laptop back inside it. kate shouts.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{jackson, what are you doing?}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{i'm coming.}
<A>__{he jumps out of the car and races back after them. behind jackson the hangar starts to disintegrate.}
<B>__{in the distance}
<A>__{a gigantic fissure forms in the earth, shooting towards santa monica airport. gordon fumbles with the controls, jackson yells from the copilot seat.}
<C>__{jackson }
<D>__{come on, come on...}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(pointing at the instruments)}
<D>__{but i'm supposed to check all these first...}
<A>__{jackson reaches over and slams gordon's hand down and the plane lurches forward. as the cessna speeds onto the tarmac the control tower goes down and explodes. noah discovers the giant crevasse forming behind them.}
<C>__{noah}
<D>__{guys, behind us!}
<A>__{as the plane accelerates, the giant crack closes in on them. gordon's hand trembles on the throttle control. everybody screams on top of each other.}
<C>__{everybody}
<D>__{gordon! damn it! lift off!}
<A>__{gordon gathers his courage and pulls the lever. the plane almost rockets into the air just as the ground beneath them gives way. they hover for a moment, almost caught in mid air as the widening crevasse beneath them fights to suck them into the bowels of the earth. gordon fights to maintain control but they begin to be pulled down. the daylight vanishes. debris and mud smashes into the plane from all sides. the canyon walls erupt.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i can't get it up!}
<A>__{taking desperate measures, gordon nearly rips the control stick out of its joint with a lurch the cessna lifts out of the abyss. they all take a deep breath only to realize that now they are flying directly into the collapsing towers of downtown los angeles! like a roller coaster, gordon manages to weave the little plane through the tumbling high rises. they dive one last time to evade the plummeting us bank tower, the tallest building on the west coast. all are dead silent as they watch the whole of los angeles crumble beneath them. kate covers lilly's eyes.}
<C>__{noah}
<P>__{(in total shock)}
<D>__{that was amazing, gordon!}
<A>__{jackson looks at kate and notices her cut.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(brushing it off)}
<D>__{i'm fine. how did you know this was gonna happen?}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{i didn't.}
<P>__{(to gordon)}
<D>__{do we have enough fuel to make it to yellowstone?}
<A>__{the plane veers off in a northeasterly direction. behind them the destruction of los angeles continues.}
