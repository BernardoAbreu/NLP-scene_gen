<A>__{dade goes to work on otv. he closes his eyes and a flurry of half second video clips from old tv shows flashes by. he opens his eyes. his screen says entering arps 331 and then wipes to another screen. automated record playback system. there is a graphic representation of the station's automatic videotape changer. dade turns on his tv set and turns to otv. it is running a rush limbaugh type tv show.}
<C>__{commentator}
<P>__{(on tv)}
<D>__{...so called american indians, latinos and blacks come from a genetically mediocre stock...}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{yak yak yak. get a job!}
<A>__{dade presses a key on his keyboard. the video changer diagram lights up in red. at the station, a robotic arm selects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of tapes. the "america first" tape slides out of the vtr and is replaced by an episode of "the outer limits" as dade watches, drinks coke and smiles, full of himself.}
<C>__{tv}
<D>__{you are about to experience the awe and mystery, which reaches from the inner mind, to... the outer limits.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{yesssss!}
<A>__{suddenly, the arps screen is replaced by an ominous message:}
<B>__{u have tread}
<A>__{upon my domain &}
<B>__{must now suffer}
<A>__{who r u?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{hey! what?}

<C>__{dade}
<D>__{unbelievable. a hacker!}
<A>__{then the screen changes again:}
<B>__{acid burn}
<A>__{sez leave b 4}

<A>__{"the outer limits" suddenly flashes off.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{yeah, okay "acid burn", that's enough.}
<A>__{dade starts hacking. apparently so does acid burn. the tape changer machines at otv are swamped, sometimes fighting over the same tape. the program on tv keeps changing. the message comes up on dade's computer screen:}
<B>__{i will swat u like the fly u r}
<A>__{more dueling tape changers, more half second video clips. another message.}
<B>__{i will snap your back like a toothpick}
<A>__{as the duel continues, dade types back a taunt of his own:}
<B>__{mess with the best die like the rest}
<A>__{one last from acid burn:}
<B>__{you are terminated}
<A>__{then his own computer confirms for him that the connection is terminated.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{shit on me!}
<A>__{next morning. mrs. murphy is unpacking. dade emerges from his room in a housecoat. he makes a beeline (dodging moving boxes) for the fridge.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
<D>__{good morning. you unpack your stuff yet?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{mm hmm.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
<D>__{up all night again, huh?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?}
<A>__{dade's mom picks up the phone, mocking a call to the building superintendent.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
<D>__{can i cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? he's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well yes, he could be playing with himself. mmm hmm. yes i will ask. dade, you like girls, don't you?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{well, yeah, i just haven't found one as charming as you yet.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
<D>__{you haven't been doing anything stupid, right, dade?}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{right, dade?!}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{right, mom. and i'm still a virgin!}
<A>__{dade slams the bathroom door. mrs. murphy quickly checks his room. dade is showering.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
<P>__{(angry, through the bathroom door)}
<D>__{you hooked it up to the phone, didn't you? dade! turn the shower off! you screw up again and you won't get into college!}
<A>__{she pauses and regains some of her cool.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
