<A>__{kimble struggles out of the bus pulling the young guard behind him. he slings the man clear. screeching death, the train skids closer. for one heartbeat, kimble remains perched atop the bus. the train light x rays him. kimble leaps. lands. rolls. gains his feet. tries to sprint away but can't: his feet are still chained. he gets off a dozen mincing steps before... impact: a hundred tons of steel slams into the bus, splitting it open. shrapnel rips through kimble's thigh, but he stays on his feet, still running feverish half steps. an explosion envelops the train. flames stream down its flanks. the train burns past the wounded guard. kimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind him. but he gets the shock of his life of any man's life: still on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing and coming after him. it's the stuff of nightmares: one little man being chased by a fire breathing locomotive. the train burrows to a stop. kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval of earth, staring eyeball to eyeball with the train that nearly devoured him. he pants. coughs on smoke. then notices something in his hand. it's the key ring.}
