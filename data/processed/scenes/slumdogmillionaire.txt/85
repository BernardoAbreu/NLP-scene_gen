<A>__{salim, shankar, jamal and the taj gang are gathered around a campfire. all of them wear extraordinary foot wear of one form or another, from elaborate high heels to walking boots five sizes too large. a home made hooka pipe is being passed around the fire. the eyes of the children have long since stopped focussing. salim is sporting a mercedes benz badge on a chain around his neck. behind him, jamal appears, his face swollen. he takes off his fake guide's badge and throws it in the fire.}
