<A>__{himbry reenters his office, moving to his desk, when he spots the closet door now closed shut. this gives him a pause he had left it open. hadn't he? suddenly, he can't remember. he shifts uneasy, reaching for the door knob, pulling the door open to reveal... an empty closet. he stands still a moment, suddenly realizing someone could easily now be standing behind the open closet door. nervously, he pushes it shut to reveal... nothing. himbry shakes away his jitters, realizing he's spooked himself. he continues to his desk, pushing his office door shut when... a ghost masked figure lunges from behind it...knife in hand. quick and easy. three quick jabs to the stomach and himbry goes down. the ghost masked figure towering above him.}
