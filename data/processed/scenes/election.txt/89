<C>__{walt}
<D>__{that little bitch made a fool of us i want her out of the election. getting everybody all riled up like that. she's finished, you hear me? washed up.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech. that's not what student government's about.}
<C>__{walt}
<P>__{(grumbling)}
<D>__{yeah... whatever. all i know is she's a troublemaker. she's on my list.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{all we need to do is send a message, so maybe we should just suspend her.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{right. that's it. she's suspended for a week!}
<A>__{to emphasize his point, walt throws his styrofoam cup at the wastepaper basket and misses. lowell the janitor, passing by outside the door, notices the cup bouncing on the floor.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i think that's a little strong walt. ron?}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{we don't want to make a martyr out of her. three days sounds right to me.}
