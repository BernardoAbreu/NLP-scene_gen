<A>__{nick stands half way down a rickety wooden stairway, watching.}
<L>__{exterior nick's trailer original angle dawn}
<A>__{linda turns and goes back inside the trailer.}
<L>__{exterior adjoining overlook dawn}
<A>__{nick swallows and starts down the stairway toward the trailer. he hesitates, pulls the bottle from his pocket, drains the last of it and tucks it under the stairs. straightening up, he claws at his hair, trying to comb it with his fingers. then he starts down again.}
<L>__{interior nick's trailer dawn}
<A>__{cakes, cookies, six packs of beer and bottles of wine cover almost every inch of available space. linda sits on the little settee, wedged between two cases of coca cola and hunched over a white sweater which she is attempting, with painful slowness, to knit. linda is trying not to cry. she is trying her god damnedest. there is a knock at the door. linda freezes. then, trying to be totally matter of fact, she puts down the sweater, crosses to the door and opens it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{guess who.}
<A>__{linda stares at him. nick gives a little laugh and steps in.}
<C>__{linda}
<P>__{(throws herself in his arms)}
<D>__{nick! oh, nick, you're back!}
<A>__{she hugs him for a moment, as hard as she can, then they pull apart.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{i thought... oh, nick, i thought you were hurt, some accident. maybe you fell or maybe some car...}
<P>__{(back in his arms)}
<D>__{i thought someone stole you away!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{oh, nick! oh i missed you so!}
<A>__{they pull apart.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{how are you?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{fine. i'm fine. how are you?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{fine. i just go along, you know. down at the market. back here. i mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... are you sure you're all right? i mean, what about the wound?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(anger)}
<D>__{that was nothing. that wasn't anything.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it was just the complications. i mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. i mean all the guys had it.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i made you a sweater.}
<P>__{(she gets it)}
<D>__{here... you have to take that off.}
<A>__{nick removes his coat. linda pulls the sweater over him}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{i couldn't remember your exact size.}
<A>__{the sweater is huge, a great rumpled thing reaching almost to nick's knees.}
<C>__{linda }
<P>__{(smoothly)}
<D>__{oh, that's fine. perfect... it is a little too big...}
<P>__{(she pulls the sweater back off)}
<D>__{... but i can easily fix that. easily. one thing about wool sweaters, they are such a cinch to fix.}
<A>__{she crosses to a garbage pail out of nick's line of sight and stuffs the sweater in it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how's the trailer?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{great. fine... once or twice it did fall off the blocks. i don't know what that's from.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{frost.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{is that what it is? i couldn't figure out.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{did you get hurt? you didn't get hurt?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{oh, no. it just kind of goes thump. would you like a coke? you don't drink coke. or maybe you do. what about champagne? let's have champagne! i don't think we have champagne. let's have this. see? sparkling. i will get you an opener. oh, that's right. no opener. let's just have beer. do you want some cheese? or maybe eggs? maybe we should have coffee.}
<A>__{she begins to sob. camera closes on her face:}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{nick? i'm so glad you're alive! i'm so happy! i... i just don't know what to do!}
