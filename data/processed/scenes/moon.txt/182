<C>__{sam 1}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{you're going to kill him?}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{someone's got to pull the short straw here, better someone who's unconscious than you or me.}
<A>__{sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of sam 2's plan.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{if we go through with this, i'm going to need your help hauling him out to the crash site.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{what about us? eliza arrives, finds you and me as the welcome party }
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{they're not going to find you and me as the welcome party, they're going to find me. you're going to blast back to earth before they get here in one of the helium 3 containers.}

<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{i saw the message on the vp. eve is beautiful. she looks like her mom.}
<A>__{sam 1 realizes that sam 2 knows everything. there are no secrets between them now. they both absorb the impact of knowing tess is dead. finally:}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{how do you think she died?}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<P>__{(then)}
