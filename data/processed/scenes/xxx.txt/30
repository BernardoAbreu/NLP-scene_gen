<L>__{interior xander's loft apartment night}
<A>__{a freight elevator rises up, bringing xander and his motorcycle into the loft. there are extreme sports action posters on the walls, motorcycle parts and barbells on the floor, and everywhere there's extreme sports equipment of every description.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{sky, you there? start packin' cause we are out of here!}
<A>__{there's a neatly folded flag hanging in a slightly crooked frame on the wall. xander straightens it as he goes by. he hears her in the sectioned off "bedroom" and heads back there.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{did i promise you a fat vacation or what? get ready to get down in paradise.}
<A>__{he comes into the bedroom to find sky, his long suffering girlfriend. she's a wannabe artist type. she's got suitcases and boxes scattered around and she's packing.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. unless this ain't for going on vacation...}
<C>__{sky}
<D>__{i'm through, xander.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i can see that. why?}
<C>__{sky}
<D>__{you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... it's insane, i can't take it anymore.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i'm having fun, what's the problem?}
<C>__{sky}
<D>__{you have all this talent, and you waste it. you won't take a single endorsement deal. meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! but no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i don't wanna go mersh, you know that. but hey, if this is about money...}
<A>__{he opens up the backpack, revealing wads of cash.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i got an advance on the next bootleg. let's get out of here, just you and me. we'll chill out in bora bora for a couple months.}
<A>__{she sorts through the money.}
<C>__{sky}
<D>__{french polynesia? this wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. do you know how expensive it is down there?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{alright, so i will get more.}
<C>__{sky}
<D>__{it's not about the money, x! you never plan for anything. i can't live like that anymore, i need some stability.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{well if you're bailing, i guess i'd better give you your surprise now.}
<A>__{he pulls off his shirt. pierced through his nipple is a}
<B>__{diamond engagement ring.}
<C>__{sky}
<D>__{what...?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i was gonna wait till the islands, but...}
<C>__{sky}
<D>__{you're serious?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{of course i'm serious. i bought it, didn't i?}
<C>__{sky}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{this is so typical. i can't believe you. i've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? are you out of your mind?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i don't know. i thought this is what you wanted. you want stability, here it is.}
<C>__{sky}
<D>__{you can't just propose to me out of nowhere. you think that's going to solve our problems? i'm sorry, x. it was a kick for a while, but it's over. you're just not going anywhere.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.}
<C>__{sky}
<D>__{you're wrong about that. i'm heading out that door right now.}
<A>__{she heads towards the front door. just then the door blows in. crash! the windows smash in too. then the lights go out as stormtroopers in black body armor rush in, weapons drawn. it's a blur of flashlights, pistols and jack boots. it's scary as hell. a professional take down. they slam xander against the wall. just like that it's quiet again. sky hyperventilates, a gun in her face.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{she had nothing to do with the tower jump. she's nobody. i just met her last night. tell them.}
<P>__{(with meaning)}
<D>__{i hardly know you.}
<A>__{the stormtrooper looks at sky. she nods. the stormtroopers take their guns off her. sky grabs up here stuff. she looks back at xander.}
<C>__{sky}
<D>__{keep the ring. it looks better on you anyways.}
<A>__{she heads out.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{god, i hate cops. what's the charges this time?}
<A>__{the stormtrooper pulls out a dart gun and shoots xander. he pulls a chrome dart from his chest, examines it.}
<C>__{xander}
<P>__{(groggy)}
<D>__{you... pussies...}
<A>__{xander slides to the floor.}
