<L>__{interior needy's house (front entry) dawn (flashback)}
<A>__{we see needy on her hands and knees in the eerie blue light of dawn, sobbing as she diligently scrubs blood and bile off the floor with a dirty sponge. the black, spiny vomit repulses her, and she gags. she reaches for a swiffer wetjet mop and pulls the trigger. no solution comes out. she curses, hysterical and sleep deprived.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{work, you...twat! swiff, darn it! swiff! swiff!}
<A>__{she collapses in tears on the floor. back on needy present day}
<C>__{needy }
<P>__{(softly, to herself)}
<D>__{shoot.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{don't talk to yourself. it's one of your more freakish needy behaviors and it makes us both look like total gaylords.}
<A>__{needy raises her hands desperately to jennifer, spreading her fingers to display her filthy fingernails.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{eww, you need a mani bad. you'd better find a chinese chick to buff your situation!}
<A>__{mr. wroblewski, a middle aged teacher, enters the room. he has a gnarly looking robotic hand and moves awkwardly.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<P>__{(smirking)}
<D>__{here comes handi snack.}
<A>__{mr. wroblewski clears his throat. his voice quavers.}
<C>__{mr. wroblewski}
<D>__{i'm sure those of you who made it here today have all heard the news. it's a dark day for devil's kettle, a day we can never, ever forget.}
<A>__{a single, stifled sob rises from the class. needy glances around the room and sees students fighting back tears. a huge jock weeps openly, tears spattering his swimsuit model decorated notebook. jennifer smirks, barely able to contain her laughter.}
<C>__{mr. wroblewski }
<D>__{the administration here has decided that today will be a unstructured day of support and remembrance. we've lost nine precious students including ahmet from india several parents, and a teacher, ms. parrish.}
<A>__{he fights back tears.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{no way! parrish ate shit?}
<A>__{needy shushes her, appalled.}
<C>__{mr. wroblewski}
<D>__{this tragedy is obviously beyond anything we can measure. more than ever, we need to band together and draw strength from each other.}
<A>__{mr. wroblewski painstakingly retrieves a tissue from his pocket with his robotic hand and dabs at his face.}
<C>__{mr. wroblewski }
<P>__{(his voice cracking)}
<D>__{we can rise up. we can overcome death.}
<A>__{needy eyes jennifer warily. the jock collapses in sobs. a tiny, acne scarred geek leans over and folds the jock into an unlikely hug.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(dry)}
<D>__{oh look, they're united in grief. that'll last.}
