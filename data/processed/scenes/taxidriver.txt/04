<A>__{credits appear over scenes from manhattan nightlife. the snow has melted, it is spring. a rainy, slick, wet miserable night in manhattan's theatre district. cabs and umbrellas are congested everywhere; well dressed pedestrians are pushing, running, waving down taxis. the high class theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows are shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the poor and common is also falling on them. the unremitting sounds of honking and shouting play against the dull pitter patter of rain. the glare of yellow, red and green lights reflects off the pavements and autos. "when it rains, the boss of the city is the taxi driver" so goes the cabbie's maxim, proven true by this particular night's activity. only the taxis seem to rise above the situation: they glide effortlessly through the rain and traffic, picking up whom they choose, going where they please. further uptown, the crowds are neither so frantic nor so glittering. the rain also falls on the street bums and aged poor. junkies still stand around on rainy street corners, hookers still prowl rainy sidewalks. and the taxis service them too. all through the credits the exterior sounds are muted, as if coming from a distant room or storefront around the corner. the listener is at a safe but privileged distance. after examining various strata of manhattan nightlife, camera begins to close in on one particular taxi, and it is assumed that this taxi is being driven by travis bickle.}
