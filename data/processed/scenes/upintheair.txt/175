<D>__{to whom it may concern, i can't even count the number of people i've fired in my lifetime. so many, that i've forgotten what it's like to actually hire somebody. we've never met, but i know you'd be lucky to have natalie keener. my advice? take her and don't look back. she'll be the best decision you've made in a long time.}
