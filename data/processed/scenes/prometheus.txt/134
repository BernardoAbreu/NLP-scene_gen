<A>__{watts's pod a steel coffin shoots away on jets through the gale. the command module plunges through the storm, tumbling. smashes against the ground in ruin. the engine pods hurtle to the ground and go nuclear, sending walls of fire twisting through the hurricane. the shockwaves tumble watts's escape pod through the air.}
