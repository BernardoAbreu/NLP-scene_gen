<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{renai tosses and turns, restless in sleep. her eyes open and she sucks in a breath. bad dreams. she blinks and looks around the room, surprised to be alone, sitting up in fright. until she remembers why. she eases back onto the bed. then she looks over at the window. there is a man standing outside it. he is not looking in at her...he is pacing back and forth, furiously smoking a cigarette. back and forth, back and forth. agitated. he has long, black, greasy hair and a grey jacket. every muscle in renai's body freezes. she becomes a glacier. her eyes are drilled to the man, unable to move. by sheer will, she manages to direct them towards the bedroom door. opens her mouth but no words will come. finally }
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{jo....osh....josh....josh...}
<A>__{she glances back at the window.}
<B>__{the man is now in the room.}
<A>__{he paces back and forth between the bed and the window, just as he was outside, ignoring renai. smoking like a fiend. and then, suddenly, he stops pacing. looks up. straight at renai as if just realizing she was there. for a moment their eyes are locked in silence... ...and then the man's face contorts in anger and he charges towards her, arms outstretched, growling in fury.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{don't you fucking dare!}
<A>__{renai lets out a shriek of terror that could strip painterior a cry from the depths of her soul. she propels herself backward, falling off the bed and scrambling back into the corner. josh charges into the room, flicking on the light seeing only renai, huddled in the corner, screaming.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{what is it? what is it?!}
<A>__{renai is incoherent. she cannot stop screaming. josh grabs her by the shoulders.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{renai, what is wrong?!}

<D>__{the man he was there he tried to there was a man there!!!}
<A>__{foster runs into the room, visibly terrified. he sees his mother and instantly begins crying. he runs to his dad, holding onto his leg. in the background, cali begins crying, her screams contributing to an overwhelming din.}

<D>__{there's no one here.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{i saw somebody!}

<C>__{foster}
<D>__{i don't want the man to get me.}
<A>__{the realization that her child is terrified quiets renai. all is suddenly silent, save for the cries of cali in the background. josh holds his son tight.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{you're okay, buddy. i've got you.}
