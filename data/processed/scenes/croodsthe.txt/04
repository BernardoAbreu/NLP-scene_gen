<L>__{exterior mouth of crood canyon morning}
<A>__{grug and the croods come to a stop at the hunting grounds. they are spent from a fifteen mile run.}
<C>__{thunk}
<P>__{(huffing)}
<D>__{yeah... breakfast...}
<A>__{we see a nest with a huge unguarded blue egg. the croods take shelter behind a rock. grug peers over the top.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{who's up?}
<A>__{eep's hand shoots up. thunk is less than enthusiastic.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{we'll flip for it.}
<A>__{grug lifts gran on his hand, and flips her up in the air.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{call her in the air.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{heads.}
<A>__{gran face plants, her head buried in the sand. only her tail is showing.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{tails. thunk's in.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{positions.}
<A>__{the family fades back and splits up. they get into fighting running position.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{ok. thunk. go. come on thunk.}
<A>__{thunk breaks cover. he dashes into the open, snatches the egg.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{hah! way to go. take it to the cave!}
<A>__{thunk passes grug and makes a bee line for crood canyon. a gerf bird smashes thunk and steals the egg back.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{oooh!}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{release the baby.}
<A>__{eep and sandy move in on the bird. sandy nips at its heels while ugga climbs up onto its head. she pulls the egg from its beak. down range, trip gerbils surface. they stretch their shared tail across the ramu's path like an arresting cable on a carrier. ugga rises to throw the egg to grug the gerbils wrap their tail around the ramu like a bola. the ramu goes down hard. ugga and the egg roll forward. the trip gerbils snatch up the egg and make off with it.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{get um mom! do it for the croods!}
<A>__{gran's cane hooks the gerbils in the middle of their tail and whips them up and over her shoulder.}
<B>__{on gran}
<A>__{dribbling the egg down range with her cane like a hockey player. liyotes pop up from behind hoodoos. they swarm in behind her. the liyotes trip gran. they steal the egg, and hit the gas. they are incredibly fast.}
<C>__{gran}
<D>__{old lady down! eep, avenge me.}
<B>__{on eep}
<A>__{crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on the blocks she has the liyotes in her sights. eep}
<B>__{launches.}
<A>__{eep runs after the liyote with the egg, cutting him off in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg into the air. eep leaps into the air taking back the egg.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{thanks!}
<A>__{a bunch of jackrobats see eep and swarm around her. she loses her footing and throws the egg to grug.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{eep!}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{heads up!}
<A>__{grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small cave. thunk following close behind accidentally trips over the tail of a sleeping bear owl knocking grug to the ground and fumbling the egg once again. thunk catches the egg just as the girelephant bears down on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks. the family members meet up as they begin their long run back to the cave. an entire swarm of animals chase the croods as they head back to their cave. the bear owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the chase. grug protecting his family from the bearowl tosses each family member onto the girelephant's back. grug dodges the bearowl's attack and uses him as a launching pad to get himself safely on the girelephant. thunk is happy to see dad is safe.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{oh hey dad, can we eat now?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{just wait till we get home. eep put on the brakes.}
<A>__{the entrance to crood canyon appears on the horizon. eep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as grug takes over the other. together they dig their heels into the ground, slowing down the girelephant. the bearowl continues the chase. the croods maneuver the girelephant to fend off the bearowl.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{eep!}
<A>__{the girelephant moving way too fast readies for the crash. the girelephant crashes into the entrance of the canyon, sending the croods flying in. they all tumble. grug makes an extraordinary football catch. he holds tight to the meal as he slams into a rock. grug holds up the egg.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{who's hungry?}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{alright! good one, dad!}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{here you go, thunk. drink up.}
<A>__{grug tosses the egg to thunk, thunk fumbles it and it cracks open.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{sorry, dad.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{looks like fast food tonight!}
<A>__{the family passes the leaky egg around quickly, each crood gets a taste. thunk is the last crood to get a mouthful, he hands it over to grug the egg is empty.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{that's alright. i ate last week.}
<A>__{a shadow touches grug's feet. he looks up the sun is setting behind the canyon wall. he holds up his hand to gauge how much daylight is left.}
<C>__{gran}
<D>__{two knuckle warning.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{come on croods. go, go, go.}
