<L>__{exterior griffith park night}
<A>__{lestat and jesse quietly move among the trees. lestat stops on a dime senses tuned. he looks into the dark. jesse is about to speak when lestat raises his finger to her lips and then points at... a couple of lovers moving across the meadow. they sit on a park bench. the woman giggles drunkenly. jesse watches and gasps as she realizes the male lover is a vampire. lestat moves forward. jesse gingerly follows. taking his lover in his arms the vampire begins to bite her neck... lestat looks over at jesse who watches, fascinated and disturbed. the vampire senses another's presence stops and turns to reveal his vampire eyes shining in the dark. lestat steps into the halo of a street lamp and hisses. sensing lestat's power, the vampire hisses and instantly the vampire is gone. jesse turns to lestat but he has disappeared, too. spinning around again she sees... lestat hovering over the mortal woman who is still in a swoon. checking to see that the vampire is gone, jesse moves closer to the bench.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{is she alright?}
<A>__{lestat looks up to face her, revealing his blood stained lips. jesse reflexively looks away.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{come closer, jesse. you want to see? you want to know?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{lestat, no!}
<A>__{lestat's expression turns cold as ice he arches his back like a great cat and goes in for the kill. the woman's body convulses... jesse watches in horror as... the woman's hands clutch at lestat, her back stiffens... finally her legs relax in an obscene parody of orgasm. jesse gasps, backs away. lestat finishes and, wiping his mouth, approaches jesse.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you see now? are you ready? now do you want it?!}
<A>__{he gazes into her eyes, finding himself desperately wanting her to say yes. the horror, the revulsion in jesse's face says it all.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{no. of course you don't.}
<A>__{she backs away from him, now terrified. something's changed in his eyes. they are cold, blank.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{well i didn't grant your final wish.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{it was an impossible wish to begin with. you see, i am unknowable.}
<A>__{his eyes still as death, he starts moving away.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{lestat! wait!}
<A>__{lestat turns toward her suddenly, grabs her forcefully, pulls her into his arms, gazes into her eyes.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{good bye, talamascan.}
<A>__{jesse closes her eyes in terror, knowing her life is about to be over. then jesse reaches for her mouth as if she were touched by something when... the image of lestat's lips kissing her lips flashes by in vampire time as... jesse's face is completely still in human time. as her hand drops, she realizes what just happened. and with that, lestat disappears. she stares into the night. there's a swish and the sound of rushing air. jesse turns, screams, backs away. it's not lestat standing there at all but mael, the druid vampire. with great speed he glides towards her, envelops jesse in his cloak, muffling her cries... whoosh.}
