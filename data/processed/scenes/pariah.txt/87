<L>__{exterior laura's rooftop weeks later}
<A>__{alike sits at the edge of the roof writing in her notebook. laura swings open the door and alike looks back in greeting, her smile fading as arthur appears behind her. laura motions to alike. alike considers, then carefully nods. laura steps aside and watches arthur pass. alike wanders to the edge of the roof, arthur follows. distant playground voices fill the pause.}

<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{you couldnt've been more than 2 years old. and when the wind would blow, all those leaves would come rushing down the street at us and you thought they were alive. you'd get so scared. you'd cry and you'd scream and beg for us to pick you up. i would try and tell you "they're only leaves, baby" and make you stay on the ground. but you were so afraid and you cried so hard, your mother would always pick you up. she always picked you up.}
