<L>__{interior kimmy's convertible day}
<A>__{kimmy tearing down the throughway in her mercedes 500 sl, a dashing, confident driver. julianne riding shotgun, hair flying, a total wreck, in the open convertible. michael is happily crouched on the little platform behind their seats, hugging his knees. the roar of the wind makes it impossible for him to hear them.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{my heart's in my throat, here. right off, i have to ask this monstrous favor...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{you need a few dollars.}
<A>__{kim glances over. at eighty miles an hour. a bittersweet look.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{dry. just like he said.}
<A>__{her eyes at once admiring and regretful.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{i can be quick. i can even be funny.}
<A>__{shakes her head. an endearing youngster.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{but i can't be dry.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{can you watch the road?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{see. dry. it's in the delivery.}
<A>__{she looks back to the highway.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{this is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{... you want a menage on your wedding night.}
<C>__{kimmy }
<D>__{no, that wouldn't be burdensome.}
<A>__{julianne studying the delicate, angular profile. hard not to like this kid.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{my classmate angelique shattered her pelvis line dancing in abeline on spring break.}
<A>__{looks over. the sweetest smile.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{be my maid of honor.}
<A>__{julianne just blinks.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{you can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{uh. how about promoting a bridesmaid? someone you know for at least forty five minutes.}
<A>__{we cut off : a huge semi who blasts his horn. kimmy fearless, oblivious, and analytical...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{the bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. identical twin debutantes from nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts. with amazing bodies!}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{which was the disqualifying factor?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{the twin part. i like to remain impartial in my contempt.}
<A>__{sees the off ramp, and slices across four lanes of speeding bullets in a heart stopping nanosecond. this kid could drive for penske. julianne has to pound her chest to get her heart started. looks back to see if michael fell out... ... he is absurdly wind blown. gives her a beautiful grinning thumbs up. loves this stuff.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{this means i have four days to make you my new best friend...}
<A>__{brings julianne's eyes back...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{and since i already know everything about you. including intimate facts i'm mortified to have heard, but too envious to forget. it's time for you to learn about me...}
<A>__{easing off the freeway. she meets julianne's glance...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{force yourself. to get personal.}
<C>__{julianne }
<D>__{sounds like a plan.}
