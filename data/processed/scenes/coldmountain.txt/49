<L>__{exterior general store, cold mountain town. day}
<A>__{ada emerges, almost collides with teague. she wriggles past him, tries to make her package invisible.}
<L>__{exterior approach to black cove farm day}
<A>__{it's winter. a solitary rider jogs his horse through the frost, towards black cove farm. ada is working at a handpump, failing to coax water from the well. she's wrapped in blankets. the farm is somewhat unkempt and so is she. the hem of her skirt is frayed. she rips at it tearing off a strip of material, which she binds around the handle in an attempt to thaw the mechanism. then she looks up to see the horseman approaching. it's teague. ada immediately heads inside the house. teague arrives at the house, takes a brace of rabbits from his saddlebag. he heads for the gate. the gate needs oiling, the path is overgrown, he looks at the pump handle, the abandoned pitcher. ada opens the door, pinning her hair.}
<C>__{teague}
<D>__{it's taken me too long, but i've come to pay my respects.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{teague}
<P>__{(hands over the rabbits)}
<D>__{i reckoned you might need fattening up.}
<A>__{ada takes them. she is very queasy with these dead animals.}
<C>__{teague}
<D>__{this house must bring bad luck. killed my granddaddy to lose it, then my daddy died on account of not having it, then your daddy died on account of getting it. we should burn it down.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{didn't somebody try?}
<C>__{teague}
<D>__{lot to manage without help. need a hand with that pump?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{teague}
<D>__{i'm happy to volunteer.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{but not to volunteer for the war?}
<C>__{teague}
<D>__{the war? i wanted to go. but you know: too old, too literate. plus i got no spleen. lost it from a horse's kick.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{you've got no spleen.}
<C>__{teague}
<D>__{that's the thing about an organ. you don't know you need it till you lost it.}
<P>__{(suddenly busy with a bayonet)}
<D>__{i want to clear this path. i can just as soon do it and talk as stand around and talk. then you can say men beat a path to your door.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i'd really prefer it if you didn't do that.}
<C>__{teague}
<D>__{would you rather i did my job?}
<P>__{(scything at the path)}
<D>__{see if there's any material i should confiscate. for the war effort.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i was raised in the good manners of the south where a gentleman doesn't enter a house with a woman alone.}
<C>__{teague}
<P>__{(now he's at the pump)}
<D>__{good manners didn't quite make it to these mountains. if it don't yield meat, or you can't sit on it, or suck on it...}
<P>__{(he gets the pump}
<D>__{going, water pours}
<P>__{out)}
<D>__{and you're sleeping all right? these cold dark nights?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i'm sleeping fine.}
<C>__{teague}
<D>__{it's going to be a long hard winter.}
<A>__{he turns and stops at the gate, runs his hands through his hair and uses the grease to ease the hinge. then steps up onto his horse, and rides away. ada watches him. shudders.}
