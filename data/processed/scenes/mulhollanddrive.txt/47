<L>__{exterior downtown los angeles low rent office building day}
<A>__{the street level of the office building is filthy and houses stores selling racks of cheap toys. up above we see office windows and a big sign saying "office space for rent" along with a telephone number to call. we drift in toward one of the windows on the sixth floor.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior office on sixth floor}
<A>__{two men are in the room, joe and ed. joe leans up against a rack of filing cabinets. he is in his late twenties. he looks like a run down, heavy metal rocker wears a blue denim shirt open, t shirt underneath, black denim jeans and motorcycle boots. his black belt has silver studs. he's smoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at the desk has said. his laugh is easy and his grin is infectious. the man at the desk, ed, wears a clean, crisp black suit, like a business man's but unlike a business man his blonde hair is long enough to go over his shoulders.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{so man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{unreal ... so, you're looking good. whatcha doin' these days?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, not much ed. just doin' some stuff for this guy.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{making ends meet, huh.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{hardly.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh, things aren't so bad. gee, i hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{it was just a thing. the story made you laugh.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yeah, that's a funny story.}
<A>__{looking like he's rubbing the small of his back joe moves over to ed at his desk. joe looks down to the surface of the desk to a small worn black book.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{so, there it is ... ed's famous black book.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah, the history of the world in phone numbers.}
<A>__{joe's hand still at the small of his back moves into view holding a silenced pistol and in one swift move reaches out and fires a hole through ed's temple blowing ed's brains out across the desk, carpet and wall. ed's head bangs down on the desk, then is still save the leaking of blood from the wounds. joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window behind ed's desk, wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and places the cleaned gun in ed's right hand. he places ed's right forefinger gently onto the trigger. as he puts the finger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the gun goes off. the bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap wall at the far end of ed's office. joe hears a muffled scream.}
<C>__{joe }
<P>__{(disgusted with himself)}
<D>__{oh...man!}
<A>__{with a sense of "just more stuff i got to do" joe moves slowly and begrudgingly out of ed's office, checks the corridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists. he opens up the office door next to ed's and finds a heavy set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her buttock and lower back. he sighs and walks over to her and cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the screaming. wide eyed, she tries to fight him off and he begins dragging her out of her office. joe's foot catches on a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone crushing blow on top of him. the woman begins beating his face with her meaty fists. joe snaps her head back, instantly stilling her violent activity. he wrestles the stunned heavyweight back to her feet and out her door. he pushes and pulls her into ed's office. just before they enter, joe notices a man with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the corridor. he stops and calls to the man.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{hey man. she's hurt bad. get down here and use the phone. help me out. you gotta call the hospital.}
<A>__{the man hesitates...not sure if this jives with what he's seeing.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{i mean it! get down here quick! she's hurt and i can't do everything myself, man.}
<A>__{joe pushes the woman inside ed's office, throws a glance back down the corridor and sees the man is on his way to him, pushing his industrial vacuum and trailing a 200 ft. long thick black cord as he goes. joe goes in to ed's office with the woman. he throws her down on the floor in line between ed's desk and the bullet hole in the wall. she starts screaming immediately and struggles to get up. joe grabs the pistol from ed's dead hand and lifts it to fire, but the woman has turned around and is almost standing.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{no, no, no. you gotta be turned around.}
<A>__{he goes to her, slaps her hard in the face and spins her around. before she can turn again joe races back to place himself in the proper line at ed's desk and quickly fires two silenced shots into the back of her head. the man with the vacuum enters. his eyes begin to widen in reaction to the scene. just then joe fires a bullet into the man's chest. the man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his hands rush up to the wound. as the vacuum cleaner whines joe rushes to the man before the man falls back out into the corridor. he pulls him into the room the man moaning and clutching his chest, starting to collapse. joe releases him and the man goes down. the vacuum cleaner seems to be screeching now in the threshold. joe fires the last bullet into the heavy duty vacuum cleaner. the bullet shorts out the internal wiring of the vacuum. that in turn blows the building's circuit breaker and all the lights go out.}
<C>__{joe }
<P>__{(disgusted with himself)}
<D>__{oh ... man!}
<A>__{now he hears voices voices moving into the corridor.}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{what the hell .... what happened? what's this cord doing here? it's the vacuum. it's the vacuum what did it.}
<A>__{joe cleans the pistol once again and places it back in eddie's hand eddie's finger on the trigger. joe picks up the black book turns and makes his escape by going out the office window and quickly descending the rusty fire escape.}
