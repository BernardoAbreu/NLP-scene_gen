<D>__{and it's been 15 years since i last wore this dress.}
<C>__{daughter 1}
<D>__{you haven't changed a bit, ma.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{working, dear, working, that's what keeps one young. the two sisters realize that the dress has a hole just below the seat, exchange looks and smile, which doesn't please amelia.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{what are you guys laughing about?}
<C>__{daughter 2}
