<L>__{interior the slaughtered lamb night}
<A>__{the pub was apparently "modernized" sometime in the mid fifties. its traditional englishness combines with greasy stainless steel and glass. it is populated by mostly pale young men with longish hair. several older men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches. four or five are watching a chess game. two men are playing darts. the conversation is loud and there is often laughter. but there is something unsavory about these people. a look of leanness and poverty. they seem inbred and somehow sullen. we establish the types and the general level of noise in the room. the door opens revealing david and jack. there is dead silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the strange attention. they give each other a "what?" look, then turn to the assembled populace.}
