<A>__{the screen is projecting the beginning of "the sorrow and the pity": a street filled with fleeing cars, belongings tied on top and piled in the back seats. subtitles pop on: "the jewish warmongers and parisian plutocrats tried to flee with their gold and jewels" as a narrator explains in german.}

<A>__{split screen: annie and her psychiatrist on the left; alvy and his on the right. annie, talking, sits in a white molded chair, as does her doctor. the office is very modern: stark, white and chrome. alvy, talking to his psychiatrist, lies on a deep leather sofa, the doctor seated away from him. this office looks more like a well worn den: bookcases overflowing, dark wood. the dialogue is separated in each screen, though no one talks simultaneously.}

<D>__{the incredible thing about it is, i'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and i'm getting screwed.}
