<D>__{you know, for the past few weeks, i sat in this house. i couldn't move. everything reminded me of rudy. then from out of nowhere i had a revelation. i am alive! your mother is alive! i became overcome with joy because i realized how lucky we are to still have you.}

<D>__{i went to work today. for the first time in weeks. it was as if i had just gotten out of college! i was fearless! i went after accounts i had avoided for years because i thought they were out of my league. i spoke to presidents, vice presidents, business managers, sales reps. i was amazing. i was magic. but when i came home to share the news with your mother, i discovered her asleep. when i looked around the house, i realized that her "office", for lack of a better word, was also piled up. so, i took to the house. i have made it my duty to clean this place from top to bottom. even if it takes me all night, i don't care. jacob?}
