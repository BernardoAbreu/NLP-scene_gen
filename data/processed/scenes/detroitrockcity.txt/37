<L>__{interior cafeteria day}
<A>__{hawk, trip, and lex hold their trays over the counter as the lunch ladies fill them with salisbury steak, hard dinner rolls and scoops of bluish pudding. ah, public school nutrition.}
<C>__{trip}
<P>__{(stoked)}
<D>__{this is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! not only are we on again for kiss in detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! i dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(double stoked)}
<D>__{stan lee couldn't think of a better one.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{the chinese have a proverb: "that which appears too good to be true, usually is." there's gotta be a catch.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{yeah? i have a saying too, lex. it goes, "catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." we're going this time and that's all there is to it.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i'm afraid our constipated little friend is right this time, trip. there is a catch.}
<A>__{hawk's really got their attention now.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{namely?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{our band "mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. jam's mom said something about sending him to st. bernard's, right? we gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{but... but, st. bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{so? your mom's car has a cb, radar detector and cruise control, check?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{we are not stealing my mom's car.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{damn straight we are.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{hawk, all i need is one ding on the volvo and presto! there are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from cincinnati.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{and when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{sunday, but...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{then lighten up. she'll never know we touched it. alright, here's the plan. we bus it to chez lex, grab the volvo, bail jam the hell outta st. bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to detroit.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{simplicity, hawk.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{simple icity is more like it. and you guys thought jam was in trouble before. wait till mrs. bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{there's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, lex. you familiar with a condition known as absolute zero?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{the hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? yeah, i'm vaguely familiar}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{well, jam is in absolute trouble. he couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. you know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see peter criss's drum solo, never mind a whole kiss concert, check?}
<A>__{lex nods.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{just for the record, i understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i was just explaining to lex here what you and i already know. just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{very funny, hawk. okay, i'm in on this hare brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, i'm blaming you. i will say you drugged me or something.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{curly.}
<A>__{hawk scopes out the cafeteria to make sure the coast is clear.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{ok, dudes, follow my lead.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{wait a minute. we ditching the rest of school?}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{about fuckin' time if you ask me. i'm just going through the motions till i drop out anyway.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{hello summer detention.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{as i was saying, follow my lead. and maintain. elvis just showed up.}
<A>__{hawk points across the cafeteria and sure enough elvis has just entered. luckily, he hasn't noticed the boys yet. elvis swaggers to a table of cheerleaders, puts his leg on a chair and starts a one sided conversation with them. they promptly push their trays away, having lost their appetites. meanwhile, back at the condiment tray, hawk and trip each grab a big handful of ketchup packets and head to a table. lex reluctantly follows suit grabbing a big handful of ketchup packets too. all three of them put their trays down and sit.}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(eyeing elvis)}
<D>__{five second rule, boys. see you on the other side.}
<A>__{hawk approaches the exit door, glances either way, then leaves. trip and lex look at their watches for five seconds. then trip heads for the exit door also. lex still stares at his watch. after five, he looks at elvis, who stops talking to the cheerleaders. as if possessing some sixth sense, elvis turns quickly and looks straight into}
<B>__{camera.}
<A>__{elvis's pov he spots the swinging exit door and an empty table with three full lunch trays sitting on it.}
<C>__{elvis}
<D>__{excuse me, ladies.}
<A>__{relieved he's gone, the cheerleaders start eating again. elvis moves through the cafeteria in slow motion toward the exit door. the hunter in action.}
