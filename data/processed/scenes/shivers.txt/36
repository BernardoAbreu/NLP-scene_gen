<L>__{interior rollo's lab night}
<A>__{in his lab, rollo sits at the gynecological table abandoned by hobbes. rollo is using it as an auxiliary desk. on the table are several opened waxed paper packages of beef knishes and accessories. there are also several old cardboard shoeboxes, some still tied with string, some opened and overflowing with papers of all kinds: hobbes's private notes.}

<D>__{yeah, well, i'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.}
<C>__{st. luc }
<D>__{no? how come?}
<C>__{rollo}
<P>__{(shuffling papers)}
<D>__{listen, rog. i knew hobbes was funny, you know? i told you that. but i didn't really know just how funny he was. see... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother she's still alive but just barely and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. i'm hobbes's partner, right?}
<P>__{(laughs sardonically)}
<D>__{anyway, i've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. we never really knew what it was we were working on. hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.}
