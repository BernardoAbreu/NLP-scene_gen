<L>__{exterior municipal pool mexico city day}
<A>__{creasy doing laps. he swims the last few meters underwater. as he surfaces, pinta waits by the edge. she nods in grim satisfaction. he isn't doing well. the cloud of deep red emanating from his stomach envelopes his whole body.}
<L>__{interior dining room evening}
<A>__{samuel eats dinner silently. lisa just stares into space, nursing a vodka. even great marriages cannot survive the trauma of kidnapping and subsequent death. the door opens and they expect to see maria with the deserts. creasy enters and sits at the table like a dinner guest.}
<C>__{creasy}
<P>__{(to samuel)}
<D>__{i'm going to talk to your wife. if you move or say one word, i will kill you.}
<A>__{he takes a colt officer model .45 semi automatic pistol out of his waistband and lays it on the table in preparation for something, we don't know what. he turns to lisa.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i'm going to tell you a story. your lawyer is dead. someone didn't want him talking. last week he wired $2.5 million into his u.s. bank account. colonel ernesto tazinari is also dead. he hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5 million. if my arithmetic is correct it means $5 million remains.}
<A>__{creasy looks to samuel.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{your husband magically had five million deposited in a u.s. bank account last friday.}
<A>__{lisa's eyes never leave creasy's...trying to discern whether this is true or not.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{they planned it, samuel and kalfus.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{planned what?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{an autosequestra. kalfus arranged for pinta to be taken to a safehouse. i'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching tv. it didn't work out that way. everything got fucked up when i killed the cops and tazinari saw an opportunity.}
<A>__{lisa screams. creasy gestures with a finger to his lips.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{on the surface it was low risk and high return. this was the third autosequestra jordan had organized for clients. the other two succeeded.}
<A>__{samuel looks to lisa.}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{our lifestyle was in jeopardy. my pain and weakness only fueled your anger and determination. i wasn't sure about whether to go through with it or not. then i woke up one day and it was done.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{jordan was supposed to take care of it.}
<A>__{through all of the above, creasy removes the special bullet held in the seam of his wallet. the misfire. he empties the other cartridges from his gun. lisa suddenly attacks samuel in a violent, emotional outburst of tears, screaming, and rage. drawing blood from his nose and upper lip. samuel smothers lisa's arms beneath his. he appears strong and decisive for the first time. creasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the magazine and chambers the round. he looks into samuel's eyes.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{a bullet does not lie. a bullet tells the truth. and the truth will set you free.}
<A>__{creasy hands samuel the gun.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{in many ways i think this bullet should be shared between you and lisa.}
<A>__{creasy exits the room. samuel kisses lisa on the forehead and exits onto the terrace.}
<B>__{a gunshot.}
