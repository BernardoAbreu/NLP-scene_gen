<C>__{father}
<D>__{oh, don't worry, these things happen. it does everyone good to cut loose once in a while.}

<C>__{spud}
<D>__{i'd really rather take care of it myself.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{spud, they're my sheets.}
<A>__{she takes hold of the bundle. spud does not yield. she pulls harder. spud holds on. she tugs powerfully. the bundle bursts open with an explosion of vomit and excrement that covers everything in the kitchen. only spud remains untouched. }
<C>__{spud}
<A>__{i guess this means i will never get to have sex with gail.}
