<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior void day}
<A>__{standing in a nonexistent set is andy kaufman, looking a bit nervous. wide eyed, tentative, he stares at us with a needy, unsettling cuteness. his hair is slicked down, and he wears the "friendly world" costume from the andy kaufman special. finally, andy speaks in a peculiar foreign accent.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{hallo. i am andy. welcoom to my movie.}
<P>__{(beat; he gets upset)}
<D>__{i hoped the story of my life would be nice...but it turned out terrible! it is all lies! tings are mixed up... real people i knew play different people. what a mess! so i broke into universal and cut out the junk. now it's much shorter. in fact, this is the end of the movie. so tanks for comink! bye bye!}
<A>__{andy puts a needle on a phonograph, and swelling closing credits music starts to play. final credits roll. andy stands frozen, awkwardly looking at the audience. every time the music ends he picks up the needle and restarts the music. he does that as many times as the credits require. finally, credits end. and then a sly smile. he leans in. drops his accent and whispers.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{okay! just my friends are left. i wanted to get rid of those other people... they would have laughed in the wrong places.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i was only kidding about the movie... it's actually pretty good! it shows everything... from me as a little boy until my death }
<P>__{(his eyes pop; he covers his mouth)}
<D>__{oops!! i wasn't supposed to talk about that! oh. eh, uh, we better just begin. it starts back in great neck, long island...}
<A>__{andy turns to a primitive 16mm projector and turns it on. whir! he smiles at the flickering light.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{oh, yes. i remember it well...}
<A>__{we push into the white light. it fills our frame, blazing whiter, whiter...}
