<L>__{interior cave night}
<A>__{chuck is finishing his first figure, a crude portrait of a man himself? hard to tell. he examines his work. he takes some shells and sticks them on as eyes. chuck picks up wilson, thinks.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you old airhead, you need a makeover.}
<A>__{he takes some charcoal out of his fire and draws eyebrows on the ball. then, he mashes some berries, dips his fingers in the juice, and makes lips. he sticks shells on with clay for eyes. then he looks at the face.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{wilson, you bad!}
<A>__{he sits back and regards his companion. he gestures around the cave at the new paintings.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{but wilson doesn't have an opinion.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you don't share much, do you?}
<A>__{idly chuck takes down the angel box.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i guess i know how kelly felt.}
<A>__{for a long time he studies the wings on it. with a stick, he tries to draw a similar wing on the dusty floor of the cave. dissatisfied, he wipes it away. he looks at the angel box. casually he reaches over and cuts it open with a stone knife. inside he finds two bottles of green salsa. and a letter. he reads over it.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you said our life was a prison. dull. boring. empty. i can't begin to tell you how much that hurt. i don't want to lose you. i'm enclosing some salsa, the verde you like. use it on your sticky rice and think of home. then come home to me. we'll find the spice in our lives again. together. i love you. always. bettina.}
<A>__{visibly moved, chuck puts down the letter.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{he never got it.}
