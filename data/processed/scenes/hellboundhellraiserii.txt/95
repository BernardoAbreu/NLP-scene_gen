<L>__{interior bare chamber hell}
<A>__{the smoke and wind subside but not entirely. kirsty is standing in exactly the same position in a room of exactly the same proportions, but which is completely empty and which has walls of the same gray stone that the corridors do. suddenly, rising up from behind kirsty, comes pinhead.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{ah, kirsty. and we thought we'd lost you.}
<A>__{kirsty swings round in terror. as the mist continues to clear, she sees, advancing to join pinhead, the female cenobite and the chatterer. beyond them, it is now revealed, that this chamber has no fourth wall; it gives directly onto the corridors}
<C>__{female cenobite}
<D>__{so sweet of you to come back.}
<A>__{kirsty begins to work furiously at the box she has brought from malahide's house. it sent them away at the end of hellraiser. she obviously hopes it will work again. pinhead raises a hand and the box simply flies out of kirsty's hands and hovers in the air between them. kirsty stares, open mouthed.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{how can it send us back, child? we're already here. and so are you.}
<A>__{suddenly pinhead works at the box himself by remote control and with dazzling skill. he turns the box rapidly through positions kirsty and we have never seen before even opening it out at one stage into a large, two dimensional square. finally, it closes itself down but in a wholly new shape; a white, multi faceted, diamond shape and drops back into kirsty's hands. he stares at kirsty and makes a small gesture with his brow. it is almost cute. if anything, it resembles the cocky, aren't i clever look steve gave kirsty after swallowing the cigarette in hellraiser. then his face assumes its normal deadly blankness. kirsty shakes her head dumbly and begins to back into a corner, hoping that if they converge on her, she might just be able to slip around them and get back to the labyrinth.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{no! you... you can't! it wasn't me...i didn't do it! i didn't open the box!}
<C>__{female cenobite}
<D>__{didn't open the box. and what was it last time? didn't know what the box was. and yet we do keep finding each other, don't we?}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{oh, kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.}
<C>__{female cenobite}
<D>__{perhaps you're teasing us. are you teasing us?}
<A>__{to some extent, kirsty's ploy is working. the cenobites are moving closer together as they advance to the corner in which she stands.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{but i didn't open it! i didn't!}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{then why are you here?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i've come for my father!}
<A>__{kirsty shouts this with brave defiance. pinhead laughs in response, a very unattractive sound.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{but he's in his own hell, child and quite unreachable.}
<A>__{suddenly kirsty makes her break shouting out as she does so.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i don't believe you!}
<A>__{it seems for a moment she has succeeded. she swings around the side of the cenobites and begins to run across the chamber. the cenobites do not move but suddenly, from nowhere a hook flies across the room, attached to a metal chain. the hook buries itself in the wall only inches in front of kirsty's face, the chain pulled tight and barring her path. the wall begins to bleed. kirsty screams. the cenobites turn to face her, but make no attempt to cross the room to her new position.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{but it's true, he is his own hell. just as you are in yours.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{and what about you?}
<A>__{pinhead almost smiles at the naivete of the question.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{it's different for us.}
<C>__{female cenobite}
<D>__{we've always been here.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{we have no more surprises.}
<A>__{suddenly, as quickly as it came, the hook withdraws from the wall and flies back into nothingness. pinhead puts out his hand in an expansive gesture.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{but, please; feel free. explore. we'll always be here...}
