<A>__{we now see ben's face as he packs his suitcases. beyond him, past his shoulder, we see his wife staring in his direction. he continues to talk, although he finds it difficult to be matter of fact, moving back and forth from the dresser drawers to the suitcases.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{both the draytons are definitely gone. the hotel register says they come from london. drayton told the concierge he was a college professor. the only thing to do now is to get out of marrakesh.}
<A>__{her face shows a slight rise in reaction, mostly puzzlement.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{as individuals we're helpless here. and because of that phone call, we can't bring the police in on it. i even thought of taking that chance.}
<A>__{he pauses, and glances at her to see how she reacts. she just stares at his her eyes a little dull.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{but connect hank's disappearance to louis bernard's murder. and the first thing they'd do would be to make me tell them louis bernard's message. that...that could be, hank's...well, it wouldn't help him.}
<A>__{ben goes to take some of jo's clothes out of drawer, and comes up with a play script. he looks at it a moment, then back to jo. her eyes observe it, but she says nothing. ben continues on to the suitcase, where he lays the script in with the clothes.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we're going to london.}
<A>__{she looks a little more sharply as if in question. he notices as he goes to the dresser for more clothes.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i found out. the draytons had a private plane that's how they took hank back. it could lend anywhere no question of a passport or anything.}
<A>__{he packs some more clothes away. jo doesn't stir, she just stares at him.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{so we're going to london to find him.}
<A>__{he looks at her for a reaction. she turns her head away from him as if in disagreement, or perhaps fighting for control of her emotions. ben crosses to her, the camera panning him. he sits down on the edge of the bed, and takes out the small notebook from his coat. he opens it. in careful, low tones, he reads louis bernard's message.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{a man...a statesman...is to be killed... assassinated ... in london...soon...very soon...tell them...in london...to try ambrose chappell...}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<D>__{we're going to try this ambrose chappell and if he has anything at all to do with this, i'm going to offer him every cent i've got to got hank back. this ambrose chappell guy is our only hope. understand, jo?}
<A>__{jo puts out a weary hand as though to dismiss the piece of paper, and all that it contains. again she turns her head away. slowly ben puts the paper back into pocket. he speaks with a shade more urgency in his voice.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we've only got a few hours, jo! we have to got up and start moving.}
<A>__{ben gets up, and the camera pans him to the dresser and the suitcases. then he pauses and looks back at jo who is still looking away. jo turns back to look at ben. she is studying him now as if she has just seen him for the first time. her eyes are more alert. ben turns back to his packing.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i've paid the bill, and there's a car waiting downstairs. as soon as i pack, we're leaving.}
<A>__{slowly jo gets off the bed, and comes over to ben. he pauses, articles of clothing in his hands. for a moment she stands there looking at him, and then impulsively she throws her arms around him and clings to him. her anguish is genuine.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{oh ben, ben, ben...where is he? where is he?}
<A>__{ben kisses her on the cheek. she buries her head in his shoulder. ben stares off into space as if he hopes to find in answer to her question.}
