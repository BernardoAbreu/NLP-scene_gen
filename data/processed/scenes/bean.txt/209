<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{ah, david. showing dr. bean our good lady?}
<C>__{bean}
<D>__{actually i'm not a...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{that's right whistler's mother. looking at his mother not his father not interested in his father, couldn't give a flying doughnut for his sisters or brothers just his mother. yes.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{well, good think i may go and look at her myself...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{er ... pray tell me why?}
<C>__{elmer}
<D>__{because they've just cut her into tiny pieces, sir. that's why.}
<A>__{bean and david die and go to hell until elmer laughs at his own little joke. grierson laughs too.}
<C>__{elmer}
<D>__{i better continue my rounds, sir..}
<A>__{he strolls away.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the thing is, sir, i've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of dr bean here and we feel the time's come for whistler's mum to have her first face lift.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{exactly. she's in a surprisingly terrible state. isn't she, bean?}
<C>__{bean}
<D>__{oh yes.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....}
<A>__{bean hudders at the thought of his paint choosing. the colours are beginning to fade. however if you give me just one little year i can restore the picture to its original glory, the way it looked when whistler's mom first looked at it and said.... 0 actually i'm not sure you've got the hair right, darling." by the way, your hair is looking great today, sir.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{thank you david. however, flattery will get you nowhere. truth is, i have a rather different plan for whistler's dear mama. bernie and i have been inspecting our books and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{... you have to sack me. i understand, sir. i will go quietly. in fact i will go right now.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{no. no, no, hold on ... we cant sustain our loses so i've decided.. to sell whistler's mother.}
<A>__{david lets out a little yelp.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{brilliant, huh? i already have a prospective buyer the current governor of california, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal. spread the news. i think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes, sir. yes, sir. congratulations. marvellous thing. bravo.}
<A>__{grierson leaves. david turns to bean.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{bean. do you drink?}
<A>__{bean shakes his head.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{neither do i.}
