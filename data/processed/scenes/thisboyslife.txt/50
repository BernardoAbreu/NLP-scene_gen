<L>__{interior caroline and toby's house same day (later)}
<A>__{caroline and toby enter the house. caroline goes into the bedroom, shuts the door. toby sits on the couch. same scene night late afternoon sun slants through the venetian blinds. toby sits exactly as he sat before. then caroline comes out of the bedroom, ominously calm. she sits down.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{so what shall we do?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{ever since duke and i got divorced, you're a different boy. i know he never calls you and i could kill him for it but that's how duke is. and gregory's in princeton now, so i guess...}
<P>__{(refocusing)}
<D>__{so what shall we do? because this isn't working.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{we barely have enough money, kathy's moving out, and on top of it all, you've gone wild. you lie...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{no i don'...}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{yes, you do. you steal from marian's purse i just can't handle you anymore, and it scares me. i don't know what to do. so, you tell me what to do.}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(he means it)}
<D>__{i can be better. i will be.}
<P>__{(it bursts out of him)}
<D>__{and i hate the way i am anymore! i don't know why i do it!}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{what about that stenotyping thing you were gonna do?}
<A>__{with peculiar intensity, caroline speaks in a soft, odd voice:}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{it won't happen. it won't happen. it won't happen. things aren't going to turn out well, things aren't going to start looking up, and it's never going to be like heaven on a june day. there is no uranium. there is no stenotyping. there is no c.p.a. license. there isn't...}
<A>__{she stands for a few moments as if listening for a far off sound.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{... i talked to dwight: after christmas, he wants you to come up to concrete and live with him for a few months go to school there.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{what are you going to do, just give me away to him?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{if you two can get along, if it works out, then i guess he and i might get married.}
<A>__{the two stare at each other.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i can't think of anything else to do. but first i want your approval.}
<A>__{again the two stare at each other.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{caroline nods, turns away.}
