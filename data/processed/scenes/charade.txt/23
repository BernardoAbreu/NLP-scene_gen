<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{fun and games. evidently we're the floorshow.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you mean you and me?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{no, everyone. come on avanti, avanti!}
<A>__{she rises and pulls him along.}
<B>__{wide angle}
<A>__{including the dance floor as most of the patrons go to it, laughing self consciously and looking around.}
<C>__{emcee}
<D>__{ecoutez bien les regles sont tres simples the rules are very easy deux equipes two teams each with one orange une orange eine apfelsine un' arrancia held under the chin, like so }
<P>__{(does it)}
<D>__{comme ca and passed to the player behind you sans vous servir de vos mains using nothing but the chin no hands and keeping the orange at all costs from touching the floor. commencez, mesdames et messieurs begin, ladies and gentlemen signore e signori, comminciate!}
<A>__{the emcee now circulates, forming teams, telling the patrons to line up, making sure there is a woman next to every man. reggie and peter are the second couple in their line. then the emcee picks up a basket of oranges and places one under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man at the head of the line. blowing a whistle, a signal for the game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under their chins to under the chins of the women without using their hands. (this maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next in line, where the process begins anew. however, the slightest miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of human frailties haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co ordination will surely result in losing control of the orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve it again, with the chin only. this latter is an activity which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be a torment for total strangers and or the english). various shots orange game some of the couples in various states of confusion, entanglement and intimacy all of them, naturally, hilarious. two shot peter and girl it is his turn to take the orange from a very short, but quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an abundance of cantilever). peter 'takes' when he sees the twin obstacles which might and probably will encumber the game but increase his worldly experience. the contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success difficult, if not impossible. then, inexorably, the orange starts to slip down the girl's front. manfully he goes after it. close shot reggie she is enjoying it thoroughly. two shot peter and girl bending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half nelson, peter makes a last valiant effort and voila, grips the orange under his chin amid much cheering and congratulations from members of his team. now he turns to reggie and they face one another for a moment.}

<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{lay on, macduff.}
<A>__{they go at it, working their bodies together to make it all possible. then, for a moment, the game and the onlookers seem less important than their proximity. but, alas, they are too good despite themselves and the transfer is accomplished again with appreciative cheers from the team. reggie, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin, turns to the next team member in line and is locked in an embrace before she realizes her partner is leopold gideon, the short, fat, balding man seen at the funeral and later in bartholomew's photo. reggie starts to draw back but gideon holds her tightly. putting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly in reggie's ear. close two shot reggie and gideon her eyes show her fright as he whispers:}

<A>__{including reggie and gideon and peter standing by, as well as some spectators. peter comes quickly forward.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{reggie what's the trouble?}
<A>__{reggie realizes that gideon no longer offers any resistance. she steps back, leaving gideon holding the orange, foolishly, under his chin, his eyes still closed. reggie stares at him for a moment.}

<A>__{close shot gideon slowly, his eyes open and tears stream from them, rolling down his cheeks. he speaks while holding the orange.}
