<L>__{exterior taco stand day}
<A>__{simon is holding court. over tacos, he waxes eloquent on his greatest area of expertise. we see harry laughing, going along with the guy. pretending to bond.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{let's face it, harry, the vette gets 'em wet. but it's not enough. if you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and you've got one.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{it's killer. look at me i'm not that much to look at. no really. i can be honest. but i got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either. some are.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so what's your angle?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{sorry. trade secret.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{sure. set me up and then don't tell me.}
<A>__{simon leans forward, conspiratorially.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{okay, just ask yourself. what do women really want? you take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years. stuck in a rut. they need some release. the promise of adventure. a hint of danger. i create that for them.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so you're basically lying your ass off the whole time? i couldn't do it.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{well, think of it as playing a role. it's fantasy. you have to work on their dreams. get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{doesn't matter. i like change. you know, constant turnover. as soon as i close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{use 'em and lose 'em.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{exactly. the trick is, you gotta pick your target. they have to be nice little housewife types. school teachers. but, i'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck start a leaf blower.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what about the husbands?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{dickless. if they took care of business, i'd be out of business, know what i mean?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{those idiots.}
