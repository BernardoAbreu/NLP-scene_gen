<D>__{tom? lisa sherman is dead. but you'll never believe what i found out. meet me at the roadhouse on route nine in a half hour. we need to talk in private.}
<A>__{as brent finishes his message the camera moves across the principal's desk, first revealing a few blood drops on a piece of paper and then the killer's hand, holding the razor. the killer has been listening to the message. tom, the principal, is sitting in the corner in a large puddle of his own blood, tied to the radiator. he's barely alive. his tongue has been cut out, his foot cut off at the ankle and shoved into his mouth. one eye is missing, the other one has been left in only so that tom can look into the killer's face as he's tortured. the razor blade is lifted off the table. tom braces himself, gripping his hands, preparing for more pain. the camera moves back to the phone as we hear tom gag and then the killer walking out of the room.}
