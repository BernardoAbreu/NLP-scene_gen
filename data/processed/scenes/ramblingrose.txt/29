<A>__{a long pov shot of a young and very pretty blonde girl walking slowly up an oak shaded driveway. a zoomar lense takes us toward her. she is carrying a cardboard suitcase tied with a string. her clothes are cheap, her shoes are dusty, runs are in her stockings. she is sweaty, tired and seems very nervous. rose is a very attractive girl, but her primary quality is not sexiness, but an innocence and sweetness. she pauses to wipe sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand and nervously moistens her lips as she stares ahead uncertainly at the "nice" southern home which to her seems very grand. it is apparent she is badly frightened and apprehensive about what lies ahead. she is also exhausted from the heat and a long hot walk in the southern sun. she blinks at perspiration, swallows in anxiety again and forces herself to walk on.}
