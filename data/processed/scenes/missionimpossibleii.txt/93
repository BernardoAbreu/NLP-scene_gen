<A>__{pass a couple of doorways. a pigeon flies past stamp's face and he stops. as he turn, ethan lowers himself from a hiding place in the ceiling. stamp and ethan pull their guns on one another. they're in a face off until they both agree to drop their guns, but stamp catches his in mid air and points it back at ethan.}

<D>__{you're too trusting. raise your hands slowly.}
<A>__{as ethan raises his hands, he pulls the pin on a grenade and then kicks it between stamp's legs. the handle flies off: it's live. when stamp looks down in surprise at the grenade, ethan kicks out his gun. trying to escape the grenade, stamp smashes into ethan and seems to have hit him in the jaw. both hit the ground as the grenade explodes, with stamp appearing to have the upper hand.}
