<L>__{interior the carousel night}
<A>__{the carousel is a run down tavern at the edge of town, the kind with nascar posters, wobbly chairs and strands of plastic pennants crisscrossing the ceiling. it's a busy night and the bar is teeming with locals. a bartender sells a case of beer to a customer and passes it over the bar.}

<D>__{chip was right. the carousel is definitely not a club. clubs are for attractive people in populous urban areas. clubs have djs and champagne and separate bathrooms for guys and girls. all we have is a broken jukebox, a few domestic taps and the sticker toilet.}
