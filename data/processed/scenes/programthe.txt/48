<C>__{joe}
<D>__{your dad? you mean he owned a chain of these?}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{not everybody with a southern accent has their own plantation. my dad could never afford to send me here. i learned to play tennis on public courts. mighta been able to play pro someday, if i hadn't hurt my knee.}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{just tryin' to keep my edge, camille. the other guys look to me cause they think i will do anything. i lose that, i'm just another guy, and we all get our ass kicked.}
