<A>__{close on a monitor on which plays a news report.}
<C>__{reporter }
<D>__{...and of course, the top story is still the sensational theft of the new improbability drive prototype ship heart of gold last week, stolen at the launch ceremony by none other than galactic president zaphod beeblebrox.}
<C>__{zaphod }
<D>__{so, in the name of the people and freedom and, i dunno, democracy and stuff like that, i hereby declare this ship officially stolen!}
<A>__{pull back to reveal zaphod beeblebrox, leaning toward the tv, watching with a very satisfied grin...}
<C>__{female voice }
<D>__{three to one...two to one...}
<A>__{annoyed, he turns. there's a woman with red hair (trillian), her back to him, reading numbers off a console display and speaking into a microphone.}
<C>__{trillian}
<P>__{(into microphone)}
<D>__{probability factor of one to one...we have normality, i repeat we have normality. anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem. please relax. you will be sent for soon.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{hey. do you mind? i can't hear.}
<A>__{trillian turns and we now recognize her as tricia from the fancy dress party. her hair is shorter and bright red. she looks amazing.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{can we put your ego aside for one moment? something important has happened.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{if there's anything more important than my ego on this ship, i want it caught and shot now.}
<A>__{he turns back to the tv and turns it up.}
<C>__{reporter }
<D>__{...the question everyone seems to be asking is, has the big z finally flipped? we asked his private brain care specialist, gag halfrunt...}
<C>__{gag halfrrunt}
<D>__{vell, zaphod's just zis guy, you know }
<A>__{the tv suddenly clicks off. zaphod spins. trillian's holding a remote.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{hey...}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{we have a couple of hitchhikers in our receiving bay.}
<A>__{his head jerks upwards. he quickly grabs it with his hands and shoves it back down.}
<C>__{trillian }
<D>__{i didn't pick them up. the ship did.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{when you engaged the improbability drive.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{i didn't engage the drive.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{we picked them up in sector zz9 plural z alpha where you picked me up.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{that's impossible.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{no. just very, very improbable.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{i don't have time for this! we've got the police of half the galaxy after us and we stop to pick up hitchhikers?! okay, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking, eh?}
<A>__{he reaches for a hi tech gun on the wall. she stops him.}
<C>__{trillian}
<P>__{don't. i will send marvin. (calling)}
<D>__{marvin!}
<A>__{zaphod rolls his eyes as a humanoid robot rises from its seat behind them. this is marvin. he trudges slump shouldered toward zaphod.}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{i think you ought to know i'm feeling very depressed.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{we have something to take your mind off things.}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{it won't work, i have an exceptionally large mind.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{i know. go down to the number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up here.}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{just that?}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{i won't enjoy it.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{she's not asking you to enjoy it. just do it will you?}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{all right. i will do it.}
<A>__{marvin turns and trudges away. then he turns again.}
<C>__{marvin }
<D>__{i'm not getting you down at all am i?}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{no, no, marvin, it's fine really. it's just part of life.}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{life. don't talk to me about life.}
<A>__{marvin trudges away. a door slides open for him and makes an audible, satisfied sigh as it does.}
<C>__{door}
<D>__{mmmmmyaaahhhhhh!}
