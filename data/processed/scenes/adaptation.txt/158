<A>__{kaufman rides up in the crowded elevator. it stops a few times; people get off and on. kaufman sweats. the doors open. the new yorker logo is painted on the wall opposite the elevator. nobody gets off or on. the doors close. the elevator continues up. kaufman hates himself. soon the elevator is emptied out with the exception of kaufman. it begins its descent and stops once again at the new yorker. this time orlean gets on. kaufman is absolutely panicked. orlean looks at him blankly, presses "lobby", and faces front. kaufman sweats, studies the back of her head. the elevator arrives at the lobby. orlean gets out. kaufman hesitates, then follows.}
