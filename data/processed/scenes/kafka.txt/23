<A>__{kafka's office morning kafka walks toward his desk. nearing, he sees the assistants laughing in lunacy between themselves. they hush up immediately when they notice him, and are pretending to work when he arrives. he watches them out of the corner of his eye as he arranges himself at his chair.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{how was your evening?}
<A>__{at this sign of sympathy they immediately scuttle their chairs closer to him.}
<C>__{assistants}
<D>__{fine terrible.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(uncovering his typewriter)}
<D>__{what was the matter with it?}
<C>__{oskar}
<P>__{(indicating ludwig)}
<D>__{he can't sit still. just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<P>__{(to kafka)}
<D>__{you look tired.}

<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{gabriela rossman was here looking for you. do you know her?}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{oskar}
<D>__{we saw her naked once didn't we.}
<A>__{he elbows ludwig violently.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<D>__{women are all you have on your mind!}
<C>__{oskar}
<D>__{she went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour we watched her changing.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i didn't realize you'd been here that long.}
<C>__{oskar}
<D>__{you mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day? what a good detective you are.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<D>__{they keep switching us from department to department. he doesn't mind because he can't sit still.}
<C>__{oskar}
<D>__{we used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<D>__{it's not too bad working here.}
<A>__{kafka stands up, pleased for them in their innocence.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{you don't think it's a horrible double life from which there is probably no escape but insanity?}
<A>__{the assistants look at each other, perplexed by this attitude.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i'm glad for you.}
<A>__{he starts to go.}
<C>__{oskar}
<P>__{(calling after him)}
<D>__{you should be content, you know!}
<A>__{the stick like figure of kafka turns into the long center aisle, walking between the endless rows of busy desks. he sidetracks, taking a shortcut along a narrower aisle toward the exit he's heading for. another clerk is coming the other way and they both at the same instant turn sideways to sidle efficiently by one another, an almost balletic maneuver, perfected after years of office experience, nothing more than a short breath of air passing between them.}
