<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{claire sits on a couch in the cramped living room. mrs. frank serves up a mug of coffee. a soap plays silently on an old 19" rca.}
<C>__{mrs. frank}
<D>__{just plain old coffee. none of that mocha nonsense.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{it's fine.}
<A>__{she sizes claire up.}
<C>__{mrs. frank}
<D>__{you look a little old for a student.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i'm not. we...we met at a party.}
<C>__{mrs. frank}
<D>__{sounds about right. never understood how a girl that wild got all a's. sure didn't get it from me. they wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young. maddie wouldn't hear about it.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{she never mentioned her father.}
<C>__{mrs. frank}
<D>__{well she wouldn't. he left when she was twelve. never spoke about him after that.}
<A>__{there's a silence. mrs. frank stares at the tv.}
<C>__{mrs. frank}
<D>__{don't need the sound. you can pretty much tell what's happening by the faces. turn it up sometimes, though. feels like someone's here.}
<A>__{claire doesn't know what to say. mrs. frank turns to her.}
<C>__{mrs. frank}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{mrs. frank}
<D>__{it's like that. doesn't seem real. no note. nothing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{cops say she'll be back. i just wanna know what happened.}
<A>__{claire stares at this tough, tragic woman.}
<C>__{mrs. frank}
<D>__{wanna see her room?}
<A>__{claire nods.}
