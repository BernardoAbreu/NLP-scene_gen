<ACTION>__{Blue sky, a few puffs of cloud, pierced by slanting rays of sunlight. Late afternoon on a perfect day. SUPER TITLE: "HOUSTON, TEXAS. JULY 4, 2020." As we hear, after a few more beats, an ASTRONAUT'S VOICE.}

<DIAL>__{T minus ten, nine, eight, start ignition sequence, five, four, three, two, one, ignition... Liftoff!}

<LOC>__{EXT. LAWN PARTY. LUKE GRAHAM'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON}
<ACTION>__{DESCENDING, we see PHIL OHLMYER, late 20's, kneeling, with a gaggle of eager CHILDREN around him. Phil, an astronaut, has got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using an empty longneck as his launching tube.}
<CHAR>__{CHILDREN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(all at once)}
<DIAL>__{My turn! My turn! No, I was next! No, me! Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil, can I do one? I want to do one!}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Guys, guys, please! This is risky stuff here. And I'm a highly trained professional.}
<ACTION>__{Derisive GROANS from the kids, more SHOUTS. Phil grins. There's little danger NASA will ever use him on a recruiting poster: he's messy, very hyper. Phil waves his hands for silence.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay, okay! Uncle Phil will launch another booster...}
<ACTION>__{Another astronaut, RENEE COTE, a tall, very fit French woman, is walking by with a fresh six-pack. She tosses a beer and Phil catches it.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...just as soon as he completes his fuel intake.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANGLE FOLLOWS COTE}
<ACTION>__{Who grins, walking away from Phil and the kids, as we begin to get a better sense of the scope of this party. We are in the big back yard of a middle-class home in a Houston suburb. DOZENS OF PEOPLE - astronauts, NASA personnel, and their families -- are gathered around picnic tables or spread-out blankets. Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of balloons. We hear snatches of MUSIC, mostly country-flavored, from dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees are being tossed about. A banner, strung between trees, reads "BON VOYAGE, MARS ONE!!!"}
<CHAR>__{WILLIS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It'll take us six months just to get to Mars. Another year on the surface, then six months back. That's two years...}
<ACTION>__{Passing the banner, Cote lobs a beer to another astronaut, NICHOLAS WILLIS, who snags it neatly. He's got his other arm around the waist of a PRETTY GIRL. As Cote moves OUT OF FRAME, ANGLE LINGERS on these two. Willis, a very young astronaut, early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all too well.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I guess what I'm trying to say is, since this is my last night on Earth, it's gonna be a very precious memory to me. Y'know?}
<CHAR>__{PRETTY GIRL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nice try, Nick.}
<ACTION>__{As the Pretty Girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically. He pops open his beer, swigs it. ANGLE FOLLOWS THE PRETTY GIRL As she swerves around an open- pit barbecue, where other ASTRONAUTS are gathered. Cote has paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. SERGEI KIROV, a Russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as they play a game of wiffle ball. He turns, grinning beerily at the chef.}
<CHAR>__{KIROV} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won't be heading back to Earth till ten days after you guys land at our base camp with Mars Two. That's a pretty good long rendezvous.}
<ACTION>__{WOODY BLAKE, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat over a Hawaiian shirt and a "KISS THE CHEF" apron. An entire pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and Woody is basting this as he smiles at Malik.}
<CHAR>__{WOODY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you suggesting, Sergei?}
<CHAR>__{KIROV} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maybe you should bring a baseball bat. Yes? American baseball? Our two crews could have ourselves a little Solar System Series.}
<CHAR>__{WOODY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Please. Half you guys are foreigners. We'd crush you.}
<CHAR>__{KIROV} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, no, we have equal crews. Three men, one woman. Same handicap.}
<ACTION>__{He grins teasingly at Cote, who makes a face at him.}
<CHAR>__{WOODY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Easy now, you're talking about my wife.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(seeing her approach)}
<DIAL>__{And Terri just happens to be one helluva shortstop.}
<ACTION>__{DR. TERRI FISHER, early 30s, passes by with a platter of corn-on-the-cob. Short, sturdy body, a face made attractive by its alert, questing intelligence. She pauses to kiss Woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them. Then she glances at Kirov, all business now.}
<CHAR>__{TERRI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls his own strikes. Thousand bucks make it interesting?}
<ACTION>__{He's a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at Cote, who smiles, nods her cool agreement.}
<CHAR>__{COTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Eh bien. Winner take all.}
<CHAR>__{TERRI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(smiles sweetly at Kirov)}
<DIAL>__{Bring some balls.}
<ACTION>__{The other men ooooh at this, busting on Kirov and Cote, as Terri moves on. Woody, watching her go, has a thousand-watt grin.}
<CHAR>__{WOODY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You wanna know the sad part? Technically I outrank her. But if we want any peace at all on Mars Two, I'm gonna be saying a lot of "Yes, dears."}
<ACTION>__{The others laugh. ANGLE FOLLOWS TERRI as she dodges a PACK OF KIDS -- they run by her, shrieking happily - before she finally reaches a picnic table, where ASTRONAUTS' WIVES are opening containers of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad.}
<DIAL>__{1ST WIFE ...just not sure how I feel about NASA allowing couples to go on this type of mission together.}
<ACTION>__{One of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st Wife turns, sees Terri setting down her platter.}
<DIAL>__{1ST WIFE}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(embarrassed)}
<DIAL>__{Nothing personal, Terri. It's just that, well, it's kind of a funny feeling for those of us staying behind.}
<CHAR>__{TERRI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(carefully neutral)}
<DIAL>__{All the research shows that marriage will provide stability on these long duration trips. 2ND WIFE Then they haven't studied some of the couples I've known.}
<ACTION>__{Laughter at this. Terri smiles politely -- she doesn't really have much in common with these women -- before moving on. ANGLE LINGERS on the wives, who watch her go with a slight tinge of jealousy. One of them is looking around.}
<DIAL>__{3RD WIFE Anybody seen Jim McConnell? 4TH WIFE I don't think he's coming. 1ST WIFE God, that poor man. How's he doing? 2ND WIFE Totally losing it, from what I hear. Can't sleep, can't eat. Visits her grave almost every day.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(lowers her voice)}
<DIAL>__{They say he could lose mission status. 3RD WIFE Oh, that's so sad. That is just so tragic. You go to a routine physical one day, and wham. 4TH WIFE After all those years of training, too. It was their whole dream. 1ST WIFE Must be a pretty funny feeling for Luke Graham. Y'know? Now he's gonna be in the history books. First man on Mars...}
<ACTION>__{She shakes her head, awed by the thought. The others nod in agreement, following her glance... In the distance, a lone MALE FIGURE stands by the garage, his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and SUVs which stretch down the driveway and along the street. Another figure, a WOMAN, can be seen approaching him. CLOSER ANGLE FOLLOWS the moving woman -- DEBRA GRAHAM, early}
<LOC>__{30s, very attractive -- until she reaches her husband. LUKE}
<ACTION>__{GRAHAM, mid 30s, has the lean, fit body of an astronaut, the restless intellect of a scientist. He's unaware of her approach until she touches his shoulder. He looks at her with an apologetic smile.}
<CHAR>__{DEBRA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He's not coming, Luke.}
<CHAR>__{LUKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jim deserves this, too. All his friends are here. And it's my last night.}
<CHAR>__{DEBRA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(gently)}
<DIAL>__{Your last night with us, too.}
<ACTION>__{He looks at her, moved. She summons a smile. He slides his arms around her waist, kisses her forehead.}
<CHAR>__{LUKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I love you, Deb.}
<CHAR>__{DEBRA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I love you too, baby. But maybe you should spend some time with Bobby.}
<CHAR>__{LUKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah. I will. Where is he?}
<CHAR>__{DEBRA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Up in his fort.}
<ACTION>__{He kisses her again, then goes. Debra's eyes follow him, with a mixture of pride and sadness. ANGLE FOLLOWS Luke away from the garage, into}
<LOC>__{EXT. THE BACK YARD. LATE AFTERNOON}
<ACTION>__{Luke moves through the crowd. Phil and the kids are still shooting off rockets. Red streaks arc high overhead. In the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes Willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to PRETTY GIRL #2.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Deep space is so lonesome. So cold. But I guess I'll have my memories to keep me warm...}
<ACTION>__{Luke shakes his head. Willis is incorrigible. Finally he reaches a tall redwood playset. He looks up the ladder. A SMALL BOY sits on the platform of the tower, arms around his knees, staring up at the stars. A telescope rests nearby on a tripod. He looks lonely. Luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him. BOBBY, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at the sky.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who's gonna read to me now, at bedtime?}
<ACTION>__{Luke is surprised by the question. A pause.}
<CHAR>__{LUKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mommy will.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I like when you do it. Now we're never gonna finish our book.}
<ACTION>__{His voice is unexpectedly fierce. He's fighting back tears. Luke is moved. Another brief silence.}
<CHAR>__{LUKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, I'll tell you what. I've been thinking about that. And what I thought was -- how 'bout if I bring along my own copy?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Bobby looks at him)}
<DIAL>__{Then every night, wherever I am, I'll read a little bit more of it. And I'll know that you and Mommy, wherever you are, you're reading it too. That way, it'll feel like we're still reading it together. 'Cause I don't know about you, but I'm pretty anxious to find out how 'ol Ben Gunn got marooned on that island. What d'you say?}
<ACTION>__{Bobby manages a smile. He nods, feeling a little better. Luke is proud of his son's courage.}
<CHAR>__{LUKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good deal. Can I have a hug?}
<ACTION>__{Bobby's arms go around his father's neck. He hugs Luke fiercely, and Luke hugs him back. His eyes, over the thin young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence. Then, from the distance, the sound of an APPROACHING CAR. They both turn. An open Jeep is coming down the street. Its DRIVER is alone. Luke's expression changes. Recognition, then happiness.}
<LOC>__{EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATE AFTERNOON}
<ACTION>__{The Jeep stops, its electric engine WHIRRING down. The Driver climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon. The PARTY SOUNDS are drifting this way, and he hesitates a moment, seeming to gather himself. He starts gamely towards the party, then pauses again. Debra Graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting. She smiles tentatively. JIM MCCONNELL, early 40s, manages a smile in return. He has dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in. Yet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet competence in this man, an unforced authority; he's a natural leader. Debra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her. They separate, looking at each other. Her eyes are shining.}
<CHAR>__{DEBRA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We were afraid you wouldn't come.}
<CHAR>__{MCCONNELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I caught a whiff of your barbecue. After that I was helpless.}
<CHAR>__{DEBRA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{All the way out in Galveston?}
<CHAR>__{MCCONNELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Something like that.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(she smiles)}
<DIAL>__{It's his night, Deb. I didn't want to spoil it.}
<CHAR>__{DEBRA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Spoil it? He's been going crazy looking for you.}
<ACTION>__{Over her shoulder he sees Luke approaching, his arm around Bobby. The two men look at each other, the bond between them so strong it needs no words. Finally Luke smiles.}
<CHAR>__{LUKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{C'mon. A whole lot of folks here are gonna be mighty glad to see you.}
<ACTION>__{McConnell comes towards him, accompanied by Debra, and together the four of them move OUT OF FRAME, heading towards the party. ANGLE HOLDS on the parking area, as we...}
<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE TO:}
<LOC>__{EXT. SAME VIEW. NIGHT (HOURS LATER)}
<ACTION>__{All the parked cars and vans are gone now, except for two: McConnell's Jeep and Woody's classic 'Vette. Willis, one of the last to go, is just departing on his motorcycle. Perched behind him, arms around his waist, is PRETTY GIRL #3. They zoom away, through the darkened neighborhood.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BACK YARD. NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The yard is nearly deserted. The "Bon Voyage" banner has torn loose at one end and flutters limply. Here and there a napkin blows across the ground. In the distance, THREE FIGURES sit on the ground, by the waning fire of the barbecue pit, sipping beers.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{CLOSER ON THIS TRIO}
<ACTION>__{As Woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames. For a moment he, McConnell, and Luke are silent, staring at the sparks as they rise towards the stars -- red and gold dots mingling with the silver ones.}
<CHAR>__{WOODY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(abruptly)}
<DIAL>__{I wish we were all going. Together.}
<ACTION>__{The intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even Woody himself. Luke glances at McConnell. An awkward beat.}
<CHAR>__{LUKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then you've got a short memory. Think back to how we were by the second week of lunar training.}
<CHAR>__{WOODY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{LUKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{You just can't let that go --}
<CHAR>__{LUKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, man, three commanders, on the same ship? If they sent us off to Mars together, there wouldn't be enough fuel to lift all those egos.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(laughs)}
<DIAL>__{Bullshit, we would've made a great crew.}
<CHAR>__{MCCONNELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{WOODY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{LUKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, and who scored highest on the lunar rankings?}

<DIAL>__{Let it go, Luke.}
<CHAR>__{MCCONNELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(smiles)}
<DIAL>__{Sure, I made a little noise. But putting the first footprints on Mars? Nah. That's for guys who...}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(looks at Woody)}
<DIAL>__{...read too much science fiction as a kid and still wear little Flash Gordon rocketships around their necks.}

<CHAR>__{WOODY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You read the same damn science fiction books that I did! You're just not man enough to wear jewelry!}
<ACTION>__{He pulls from his shirt a little Flash Gordon rocketship emblem hanging on a chain, and waggles this tauntingly at McConnell, as Luke and McConnell laugh.}
<CHAR>__{WOODY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You want Flash. You know you want him. Well you'll have to come through me!}
<ACTION>__{Luke grabs Woody's arm to give McConnell a better shot at the emblem, but Woody cuffs his hands away, laughing. McConnell, watching their horseplay, shakes his head.}
<CHAR>__{MCCONNELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{God, she would've loved to see you two clowns. Just one more time.}
<ACTION>__{He tries to smile, but his face reddens. Then all at once his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions. Woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but McConnell shakes him off, rises abruptly. He turns his back on them, walking away a few steps. Woody and Luke exchange a worried glance.}
<LOC>__{EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATER THAT NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{McConnell and Luke watch as Woody starts up his Corvette. McConnell has regained his composure.}

<CHAR>__{LUKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll see what I can do. Just make sure you bring some fresh beer.}
<CHAR>__{WOODY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You got it.}
<ACTION>__{With a final glance at McConnell, Woody slips the car into gear. McConnell and Luke watch as he drives away. A silence. Luke glances at his old friend, growing more serious. We sense he's been waiting all night for a chance to say this.}
<CHAR>__{LUKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Should've been your mission, Jim. Yours and Maggie's.}
<ACTION>__{McConnell, looking after Woody's car, becomes very still.}

What's most striking, however, is a WHITE PEAK barely protruding through the rubble two-thirds of the way along the mountain's ridgeline.

Then suddenly the fluid is over his mouth, his nose, his forehead. His whole body is submerged! The level of fluid continues to rise towards the unseen top of the cylinder.}

<ACTION>__{WIDEVIEW FROM ABOVE, as the energy vortex bends from side to side, pushing back the swirling storm that surrounds the Face. As the vortex coalesces its energy into a cylindrical shape, we see through its center to a rising form -- the Martian ship.

<ACTION>__{MCCONNELL'S FACE Is spinning and shaking too, more and more violently, as the huge buildup of G-forces tears at his body. We're reminded of Nick Willis just before the vortex exploded him; is the same thing about to happen to McConnell? His eyes remain tightly shut, bubbles are streaming from his lips. His last breath is nearly exhausted, it's being shaken from his lungs.}

And then, all at once, the SHAKING STOPS. Time itself seems to stop. McConnell opens his eyes, staring STRAIGHT AT US. And then, fully accepting his fate, he throws his head back, opens his mouth and takes in a deep lungful of the fluid. He can breathe it. His eyes widen in surprise and understanding. He can breathe it! This fluid will keep him alive! His whole body relaxes, the tension draining from his head and shoulders, as he fully trusts this launch for the first time. And then, with his eyes wide open, he sees, from memory, one final image...}
