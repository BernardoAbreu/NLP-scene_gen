<L>__{interior record room day}
<D>__{sister (?) enters to find martha going through a cabinet.}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(slightly guiltily)}
<D>__{oh, good afternoon sister, i... i'm looking for some biographical data on sister agnes, and mother said i might find it here. the sister smiles, goes to another cabinet, extracts a file}
<A>__{and hands it to}
<D>__{her.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{thank you. the sister nods and without a word leaves the room. martha}
<A>__{waits until she has gone, then opens the cabinet and pulls out another file. glancing at the door, she compares the two files. they both have the same surname burchetti. the the door opens and mother miriam is standing there.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{you lied to me}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(brandishing the files)}
<D>__{your niece!}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{i didn't tell you because i didn't think it was important.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{no, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{i never saw agnes until she set foot in this convent. my sister ran away from home. we lost touch with her. and when my husband died and i came here, she wrote to me and asked me if i would take care of agnes in case anything happened.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{and agnes' father? mother miriam turns out of the room. martha goes after her.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{it could have been any one of a dozen men from what my sister told me.}
