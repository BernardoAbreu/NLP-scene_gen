<L>__{exterior open land night}
<A>__{the bus roars into a gravel embankment. roars up the slope and crashes down on its side sliding to a stop at the bottom of a small ravine.}
<L>__{interior bus night}
<A>__{engine dies. dusty silence. we don't know up from down. on his knees, old guard makes his way to the driver. finds him dead. now a sound. old guard whips his shotgun around at... kimble. rising between the seats. a hairy beat. old guard might kill him just to finish things off. but a groan turns old guard's head. young guard, trying to hold his guts in. old guart turns to find kimble.}
<C>__{old guard}
<P>__{(to kimble)}
<D>__{you. you're a doctor. c'mere.}
<A>__{he slides to the young guard as the old guard scrounges up a medical kit, shoves kimble down on young guard.}
<C>__{old guard}
<D>__{do something.}
<A>__{kimble looks at his cuffs. "in these?" old guard digs out his key ring and unlocks kimble's hands only his hands. kimble opens medical kit. it's been ransacked just band aids now. kimble looks into the wound.}
<C>__{kimble}
<D>__{he isn't going to make it unless he gets to a hospital. fast.}
<C>__{old guard}
<D>__{zl.}
<A>__{in this delicate moment a shiver runs through the bus. is it just settling? with other things to worry about, kimble tries to stop young guard's bleeding.}
<B>__{angle under seat}
<A>__{we see copeland, alive. the crash has ripped the bars from a back window and shattered the glass. he works to get out the opening.}
<B>__{back to kimble}
<A>__{a second shiver ripples through the bus, stronger. kimble retracts his hands to touch a metal panel and feels a growing vibration.}
<C>__{kimble}
<D>__{just where the hell are we?}
<A>__{the old guard feels it too. he gets down on his knees and looks out one of the shattered, barred windows.}
<C>__{old guard}
<D>__{oh, shit...}
