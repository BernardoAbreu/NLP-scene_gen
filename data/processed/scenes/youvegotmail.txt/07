<L>__{interior joe's apartment day}
<A>__{a dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor. this is brinkley. the pillow has "brinkley" embroidered on it. brinkley's master, joe fox, a great looking guy, full of charm and irony, comes into the kitchen and pours himself some orange juice. he's half dressed.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{ but he chose to stay with me so that he could spend 18 hours a day sleeping on a large green pillow the size of an inner tube. don't you love new york in the fall? it makes me want to buy school supplies. i would send you a bouquet of newly sharpened pencils if i knew your name and address. on the other hand, this not knowing has its charms.}

<P>__{joe & the computer (together)}
<D>__{welcome... you've got mail.}
<A>__{and as he starts to read his letter, we hear:}
<C>__{kathleen }
<D>__{i like to start my notes to you as if we're already in the middle of a conversation. i pretend that we're the oldest and dearest friends as opposed to what we actually are, people who don't know each other's names and met in a chat room where we both claimed we'd never been before.}
