<L>__{exterior chapel day}
<A>__{well wishers, family, fans, photographers, reporters, and passers by are lined up on either side of a red carpet that leads from the chapel to a limousine waiting at the curb. barris and penny emerge from the chapel. everyone cheers, photos are snapped, rice and confetti are thrown, as the happy newlyweds make their way to the limo, barris spots a pinky ringed hand in the crowd holding a gun. barris pushes penny toward the white limo. the driver stands there holding the door open. barris shoves penny in, then screams at the driver.}

<D>__{drive, danny! now!}
<A>__{barris jumps in the car, the driver slams the door closed, hurries around the driver's door and gets in. the car peals away from the cab.}
