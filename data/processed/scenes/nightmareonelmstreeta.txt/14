<L>__{exterior front of house. night.}
<A>__{close on front door as a bolt unlocks, a key turns, a chain is removed. at last the door swings open and glen swaggers out.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{i'm gonna punch out your ugly lights, whoever you are.}
<A>__{no answer but a slight rustle in the bushes. glen does a 180 and walks right back inside. the girls prod him right back out, giddy with giggling fear.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{it's just a stupid cat.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{then bring us back its tail and whiskers.}
<A>__{the girls push him farther. glen edges towards the shadows. then the scritching again. glen stops; tina edges back into the house.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{anyway, i don't have a cat...}
<A>__{angle into the shadows. turned from the girls, glen sobers, listening. in his pov we see the street. silent houses. motionless trees on empty lawns.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{kitty kitty? chow chow chow?}
<A>__{not a living, or dead, soul. glen turns back to the girls with a shrug. instantly, a large figure pounces and throws him to the ground with a shout. the girls scream in panic and run for the house. reverse rod leaps up and shouts like a sportscaster }
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{and it's number thirty six, rod lane, bringing lantz down just three yards from the goal with a brilliant tackle! and the fans go wild!}
<A>__{rod dances into the light, flashing a wild gypsy's grin at tina. the girl's relieved and frightened at the same time.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{what the hell you doing here?}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{came to make up, no big deal. your ma home?}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{of course. what's that?}
<A>__{rod takes the spindly hand rake he's found and scraps the house's wall. it makes a terrible scriiitching sound. he grins and tosses it aside.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{intense, huh?}
<P>__{(sizes up the three)}
<D>__{so what's happening, an orgy or something?}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{maybe a funeral, you dickhead.}
<A>__{rod wheels, a knife suddenly in his hand, as if ready to take glen's throat out. nancy breaks between }
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{ just a sleep over date, rod. just tina and me. glen was just leaving.}
<A>__{rod eyes glen, laughs and flips the knife closed and away, putting his arm around tina's shoulder and laughing as if it's all a great joke.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{you see his face?}
<P>__{(lower)}
<D>__{your ma ain't home, is she?}
<P>__{(to nancy & glen)}
<D>__{me and tina got stuff to discuss.}
<A>__{he pulls tina inside without further ceremony.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{rod...}
<A>__{but rod's already got himself and tina halfway through the living room, heading into the darker part of the house.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{we got her mother's bed. you two got the rest.}
<B>__{angle back on glen and nancy.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{we should get her out of here...}
<A>__{tina darts to the front door, her blouse half out.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{hey you guys're hanging around right?}
<P>__{(fake laughing whine)}
<D>__{don't leave me alone with this lunatic pleeeeze, nancy!}
<A>__{she disappears. glen looks at nancy. too innocent.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{so we'll guard her together. through the night.}
<P>__{(moving closer)}
<D>__{in each others' arms like we always said.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{glen. not now. i mean, we're here for tina now, not for ourselves.}
<A>__{she kisses him lightly, then pushes him back.}
<C>__{glen}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{because he was scary, that's why.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{who was scary?}
<A>__{nancy turns and looks at him.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{don't you think it's weird, her and me dreaming about the same guy?}
<P>__{(glen looks away; nancy stares closer)}
<D>__{you didn't have a bad dream last night, did you?}
<A>__{glen gives her a funny look.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{me? i don't dream.}
<A>__{he takes her inside. over the sounds of locks falling shut we}
