<A>__{frank bursts through the front door. races to the steps without hesitating...}
<L>__{interior alexander's villa, penthouse night}
<A>__{cara lies on her side at demidov's feet. blood trickles from the side of her mouth. her eyes are clouded with fear and pain as she views the room half askew. then they suddenly come into focus as she sees... a figure walks into the room. frank. he stand motionless in the doorway, surprisingly calm. demidov turns.}
<C>__{demidov}
<P>__{(leans down to cara)}
<D>__{good news. he loves you.}
<A>__{demidov's men take frank by either arm and roughly drag him forward. cara lifts her head with an effort.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{that's not alexander pearce.}
<A>__{demidov ignores her and walks up to frank.}
<C>__{demidov}
<D>__{you know, mr. pearce, i thought i was finished with this sort of thing. but in your case, i've been forced to make an exception.}
<A>__{he holds out his hand and one of his thugs gives him a pistol and a silencer.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{he is not alexander pearce!}
<A>__{demidov begins screwing the silencer onto the barrel. the thugs push frank to his knees. but he's barely paying attention to them. his eyes are locked on cara. she meets his gaze. for a moment, it's as if nothing else in the world exists but the two of them. he may only be a hapless tourist, but he loves her. he's the one here, willing to give up his life to save hers.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{oh frank... i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{nothing to be sorry for.}
<A>__{demidov finishes attaching the silencer. he points the gun at the back of frank's head.}
<C>__{demidov}
<D>__{good bye mr. pearce.}
<A>__{at this moment, cara fills her lungs and screams:}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{ackerman!}
