<L>__{exterior a slum area of joliet day}
<A>__{it's a bleak, windy morning, the kind that clears the streets of all but the winos (who carry their own heaters), and the point men for juvenile gangs. we pick up a solitary figure, joe mottola, coming down the street and entering what appears to be an abandoned tenement. he pauses a second to dust his white winged alligator shoes on the back of his pants leg. sharply dressed and surrounded by the aura of one who is making money for the first time and broadcasting it on all bands, he seems an incongruity in this part of town. we follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second floor flat. he knocks on the door, is admitted by a cautious doorman.}
