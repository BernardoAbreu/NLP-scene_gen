<L>__{interior motel room night}
<A>__{cobb's eyes flare he's in a rage. he rises from the chair, his adrenaline has momentarily overwhelmed his system and he moves as a young man. cobb picks up the pistol and reloads it. cobb marches resolutely to the bed. cobb aims the loaded gun at stump's sleeping head.}
<B>__{close on stump}
<A>__{oblivious in a drunken sleep.}
<B>__{close on cobb}
<A>__{rage is in his eyes. he cocks the gun.}
<B>__{close on cobb}
<A>__{he's crying. he shakes his head.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you don't have a point of view, stumpy, you ain't worth killing...}
<A>__{cobb puts the gun into his own mouth he clears his throat, as if to make room for the gun barrel. he gags slightly and closes his eyes, he thinks for the last time.}
<B>__{close on his face}
<A>__{something's not right. cobb removes the gun momentarily and looks at it. he sees that the gun barrel is covered with blood.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{dear god...}
<B>__{cobb}
<A>__{rushes into the bathroom and faces the mirror. blood gushes from his mouth as he coughs again.}
<B>__{close on cobb}
<A>__{as he stares into the mirror.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{no... no... no... this can't be... absolutely not... this is not right...}
<A>__{cobb coughs again more blood covers his chin. he touches his chin, touches the blood, smears it around a little, looks at his hands now covered with blood.}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{stumpy?! no...}
<A>__{cobb moves around the tiny bathroom like a caged animal. he falls to his knees in prayer in front of the sink.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{our father, which art in heaven, hallowed by thy name. thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{aw, fuck it... little late for that sob sister stuff...}
<A>__{cobb rises to his feet and looks in the mirror again. he grabs a hand towel and daubs his face with it. a bit more blood trickles from his mouth. and gradually a deep calm seems to settle over him.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{... so this is what it feels like...}
<B>__{cobb}
<A>__{returns to the bedroom and sits down on the edge of the bed, next to stump who continues his deep, drunken sleep. cobb picks up the phone and dials as he continues mopping his chin with the towel. he speaks with great calm.}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{can you get me the emory hospital?}
<P>__{(couple beats)}
<D>__{hello, ma'am? this is ty cobb. can you please prepare your finest room for me? tomorrow morning would be fine.}
<A>__{cobb hangs up and leans back on the bed next to stump who is still deep in drunken sleep. one man sleeps deeply, the other just sits there.}
