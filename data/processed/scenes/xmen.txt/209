<D>__{magneto. iive seen the results of your machine. iive seen senator kelly.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{ahhhh, so the good senator survived his fall? and the swim to shore? he is stronger than i ever could have imagined.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{the experiment was a failure. kelly didnit make it. yes, you were successful in activating his mutator gene, but you failed to take into account the rest of his body it wasnit ready for the strain. kelly was dead within hours. your machine kills.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{quiet...}
<A>__{magneto pauses. shock registering on his face that he could be wrong. thinking. considering what jean is telling him. his mind races and calculates the possibility. then:}
<C>__{magneto }
<D>__{i donit believe you.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{you donit understand.}
<A>__{magneto gets angry squeezing the metal surrounding jean's head. jean gasps. this drives cyclops crazy, but he is helpless to stop it.}
<C>__{cyclops}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{stop it!}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{why canit you see what i am trying to do? why do you stand in my way?}
<A>__{magnetois anger is boiling over. thud the sound of footsteps, then another and another. the faces around the room look at the stairs as the footsteps get closer and louder.}
<C>__{magneto }
<D>__{check and mate.}
<B>__{pause.}
<A>__{suddenly: shook logan's claws shoot up through the floor, and through magnetois feet. magneto howls. the claws retract and magneto falls. magneto, writhes in pain, rolling onto his stomach. logan quickly comes up the stairs and into the statueis head. he stands over the crippled magneto. logan turns to jean who is still pressed eye to eye with cyclops. he is relieved to see her alive. angle on: storm. she sees something. several of the steel bands that support the top of the statueis head begin to move.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{logan!}
<A>__{three metal band peel off the ceiling, coming to life with magnetic energy. they leap across the room and wrap around logan. forcing his fists to press against his chest. should he so much as extend his claws, he will rupture his own vitals. the metal bands wrap behind his back. magneto raises his hand and magnetic waves ripple. metal groans as magneto peels open a gaping hole in the top of lady libertyis head. magneto looks up at the torch. the wind howls. the air ripples again as magneto levitates the steel bands holding logan, lifting logan off the ground and out the hole in the statueis head.}
