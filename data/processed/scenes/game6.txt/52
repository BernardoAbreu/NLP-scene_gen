<A>__{steven is back in the chair by the window. paisley nervously prowls the loft.}
<C>__{paisley}
<D>__{in other words i never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. steven, it's so unfair.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{of course it's unfair. the truth is always unfair. why do you think i live this way? hiding out. stealing electricity from a lamp post. because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. i can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. they'd come after me in packs.}
<C>__{paisley}
<D>__{not if you stopped hurting people. write the truth gently.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{the truth is never gentle. listen to me carefully. each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. it hurts and maims.}

<D>__{reaching down to clutch a}
<P>__{fistful of letters)}
<D>__{look how they hate me for telling the truth. it's an education, paisley. the college of raw nerves.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{letters dripping blood. cries of revenge.}
<C>__{paisley}
<D>__{yes. i've seen your victims. one past and one future. i thought i might convince you to reconsider.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{and i thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.}
<C>__{paisley}
<D>__{i don't want you, steven.}
<A>__{paisley moves towards the door.}
<C>__{teven}
<D>__{stay. teach me to be compassionate.}
<C>__{paisley}
<D>__{i'm going home to my machine.}
