<A>__{ben sits between jackie and luke holding each of their hands. rachel sits on the other side of luke; all waiting for the harvest pageant to begin. it's horribly tense.}

<P>__{(sincerely)}
<D>__{jackie? i am so sorry about today i really fucked up royalty. when you called luke i was so goddamn relieved }

<A>__{inside her costume, her breathing is sharp. she stands very straight, very bold. a brazen ear of corn. she steps forward.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{"hello! i am...}
<A>__{rachel pops up next to the stage with her huge professional camera and giant flash. her camera flashes three times, quickly. after each flash, we see the picture for a split second, annabelle. a terrified ear of corn. a lost ear of corn.}

<P>__{(blinks, disoriented)}
<D>__{um...i'm...i'm...oh...}
<A>__{in the audience, jackie is willing her daughter a recovery. sees instead, a completely devastated ear of corn.}
