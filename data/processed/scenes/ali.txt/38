<L>__{interior ring round one wide}
<A>__{it starts.}
<B>__{liston}
<A>__{right away throws a left that misses and attacks cassius, throwing seven more that cassius with extreme, awkward caution evades. he is fearful of the monster whose punches he has yet to feel. nevertheless, he does his job: measure liston's range and speed. then, a body shot catches him above the heart. cassius feels the real power of liston. it could stop your heart's beating. he survives. then...}
<B>__{cassius}
<A>__{throws his long left jab. it keeps liston at a set distance. he has liston's range, now, and he dances away from liston's charges. then, halfway through the round, cassius' eyes have hunted out an opportunity, and he throws his first combination with a few hard shots that, to liston's surprise, rock liston's head back. and, then, cassius easily evades... liston's furious big misses to the left and right.}
<B>__{cassius}
<A>__{keeps tagging liston with his long left. and, now, infuriates liston even more by merely walking away from liston's big misses, provoking even wilder and more inaccurate liston assaults. (we're aware that any liston shot could knock out cassius if it connected.) then cassius soaks up a couple of body shots, most flicks his jab, slides, dances, clinches, circles away...until...}
<B>__{at the end of the round}
<A>__{cassius launches a second combination, slams a couple of big lefts liston's way that rock his head back two times. liston's so furious, he flips, charging cassius, who hits and ducks at the same time. the bell rings three times before they stop. clay's corner cassius breathes hard. dundee works. cassius says something we can't hear.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{he was supposed to kill me. well, i'm still alive.}
<A>__{angelo is talking to clay a mile a minute, while clay mugs an open mouth...to the press, ridiculing their accusation he was all talk. it's clear he controlled round one to everyone's surprise. the bell. interior ring, round two cassius + liston we see press with typewriters, ribbon, microphones, note pads; massive tv cameras hang on platforms over two of the corners. it's a desultory, lower key version of round one. and... bird's nest tv camera + media coverage segues to liston, who throws and misses a few lefts. cassius tags him with a few rights.}
<B>__{the bell. cassius}
<A>__{literally ambles into the corner. sonny's corner: his two trainers liston's getting a lot of strident advice. the bell.}
