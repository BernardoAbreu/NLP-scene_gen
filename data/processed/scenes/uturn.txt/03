<L>__{interior bobby cooper's mustang day}
<A>__{at the wheel, ignoring impending disaster, bobby cooper, young, good looking, fiddles with the radio dial, annoyed only to find country stations. he's been driving since noon yesterday and it shows along with a heavily bandaged left hand resting on the steering wheel. he finds something by pearl jam or smashing pumpkins and he cranks it. he pops a percodan with his good hand as, in the shimmering distance ahead, he sees black shapes in the road and lays on the horn.}
