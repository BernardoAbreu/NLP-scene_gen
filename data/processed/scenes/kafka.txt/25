<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{eduard's lodging house day kafka bounds up the stairs. eduard's landing the door to his room is open. kafka goes in. eduard's room kafka comes in. gabriela is here, gathering up eduard's belongings from drawers.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<P>__{(hardly glancing at him)}
<D>__{i'm collecting eduard's things. if there's anything you want, take it or i will give it to charity.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(taking her note from his pocket)}
<D>__{burgel gave me this what does it mean?}
<C>__{gabriela}
<P>__{(now looks up)}
<D>__{burgel! i didn't leave it with him.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(going closer)}
<D>__{why were you given notice?}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{they're not obliged to tell.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{it couldn't be for that incident with burgel the other day.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{of course it could burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as i can remember. he could've killed eduard.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{you don't believe that.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{i wouldn't put it past him.}
<A>__{she's stuffed the last of the clothes into a small bag, goes to take the few other possessions from shelves and elsewhere. kafka notices that he's standing by a dumbwaiter. for lack of anything better to do he pulls the rope to bring it up. it's filled with more clothes. gabriela comes over with her bag, holding it out for him as kafka puts the clothes in but not as many clothes as they thought. behind the bundle, hidden at the back, is a briefcase. gabriela recognizes it. kafka sees her surprised reaction. he removes the case and carefully flips the latches. inside, a complex mechanism, wires connected to a clock and a clump of dynamite. kafka just looks at it sadly. he closes the case.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{it seems i knew eduard a little bit, after all.}
<B>__{ground floor of building}
<A>__{the ratty old concierge peeks up the stairs inquisitively. in the doorway of his room, a lodger clips his fingernails at a little folding table, neatly lining them up. the concierge turns and notices.}
<C>__{concierge}
<D>__{lodgers! not one of them thinks to spare me such spectacles!}
<A>__{she slams the door on him then returns to her own apartment, slamming that door too. the hallway is empty now. eduard's room gabriela turns to kafka.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{you might think i thought so myself at first that burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. but that's the very reason to beware! it's the small men to watch out for the ones who substitute method for character.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(sighs at her relentlessness)}
<D>__{now you've fallen into his trap. when he goes to bed at night burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{it's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.}
<A>__{she's got his number. he's so in awe of her he has to turn away looking out the room's small window.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{that street down there i always used to call it the approach road for suicides. it leads straight down to the bridge and the river.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{burgel hated eduard. and me. i'm sure he knew about us and i'm sure it drove him mad.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{burgel doesn't like anybody!}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{he used to like me very much more than i liked him.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{he's jealous, yes, but that jealous? he's too cautious.}
<A>__{gabriela clears some more items off a mantelpiece with a sweeping gesture.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{of course he is the castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark. people disappear up there regularly. if you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{now you're saying eduard was lured there?}
<C>__{gabriela}
<P>__{(puts away the last few books)}
<D>__{how often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i've heard of it happening.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{and burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{usually.}
<A>__{putting the bag down, gabriela goes closer to kafka, so close he almost cowers.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{or what if there really was an error? i don't know what kind any kind that needed correcting and what if burgel was responsible for it? one mistake even a small one in a firm like ours it could cost him a promotion.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{first these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant burgel. if indeed there was a mistake and a minor one at that you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{what seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{now burgel's one of the authorities?}
<A>__{she turns away from him, reddening.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{for all his big talk he is. does he really have access to the directors of the firm as he always claims? or only the deputy managers people of no importance whatsoever. someone ought to follow him for a change.}
<A>__{kafka sees an opportunity to go to her, to try to calm her, to make a timid approach to this woman.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{you won't make any sense of it while you're upset.}
<A>__{ but she breaks away.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{burgel is only there for one purpose to spy on the employees and report any and all indiscretions, real or imagined. if he didn't send eduard to the castle, you can be damn sure he's in league with whoever greeted him there.}
<P>__{(very upset now)}
<D>__{all those bastards are in league with each other why can't you see that!}
<A>__{she takes hold of him as if to shake some sense into him but really because she needs someone to hold.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{... i don't see anything. i see a message on its way to me with all the right answers. only it never arrives it's always just on its way.}
<A>__{gabriela doesn't seem to be listening. she's looking around. the little room, as if it's someone else she's holding ...}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{eduard ...}
<A>__{her head against his, kafka tentatively touches her hair and she pulls away, the spell broken.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{your ignorance of the way things are here is so appalling that it makes my head spin to listen to you and compare what you say and have in mind with the real situation!}
<A>__{she storms out, vehemently picking up her bag on the way out, and slamming the door quakingly behind her. kafka is too astonished at her behavior to make a move for a moment, then he glances at the bomb case she's left behind, then he goes out to the landing.}
<B>__{gabriela}
<A>__{rushing down the stairs in anger, tearing open the door at the middle landing and slamming that one too once past it.}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{following her down.}
<B>__{gabriela}
<A>__{coming down the final flight of stairs, disappearing through the door at the bottom, slamming that one as well.}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{almost caught up with her, coming down to the last door.}
<B>__{ground floor hallway}
<A>__{kafka comes through the door from the stairs, out of breath, and stops. he's too late. the hallway is empty. the front door at the end of it is shut. he makes a face and a moment later starts to go back up. then stops again. turns. looks back at the front door. ... the one he didn't hear slam.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{the front door opens and kafka steps out. he stands on the stoop. he looks up the street one way. deserted. he looks down the street the other way. deserted.}
