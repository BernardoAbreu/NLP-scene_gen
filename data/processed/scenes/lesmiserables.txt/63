<L>__{exterior wood by the inn night}
<A>__{cosette has filled her buckets at the well in the wood, and is now heading back. through the dark trees ahead we glimpse the cheerful lights of the frost fair and the distant inn. she goes slowly, because the buckets are heavy. she hums to herself to keep her spirits up, a wordless verse of `castle on a cloud'. after a few steps she pauses to rest the weight of the buckets. strong arms reach for the buckets and lift them out of her hands. she looks up, amazed. there's valjean.}

<D>__{tell me, my child, what is your name?}
<C>__{cosette}
<D>__{i'm called cosette.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{cosette?}
<A>__{she gazes up at him. hardly knowing why, the little girl trusts this stranger. valjean picks up the heavy buckets, and they head back towards the inn. as they go, they hum `castle on a cloud' together.}
