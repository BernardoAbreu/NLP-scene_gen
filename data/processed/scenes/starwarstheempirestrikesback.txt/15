<L>__{exterior hoth snow drift dusk}
<A>__{the wind is blowing quite strong now. luke struggles to stay upright, but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over. he struggles to get up, but he can't. the young warrior from tatooine drags himself a couple of feet and then collapses.}
<L>__{interior rebel base main hangar deck entrance night}
<A>__{princess leia stands inside the dark entrance to the rebel base, waiting for a sign of the two rebel heroes. she shivers in the cold wind as, nearby, chewie sits with his head in his hands. in the background, artoo and threepio move through the doors. a rebel lieutenant moves to major derlin, an officer keeping watch with the princess.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{sir, all the patrols are in. there's still no contact from skywalker or solo.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{mistress leia, artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.}
<A>__{leia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.}
<C>__{derlin}
<D>__{your highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. the shield doors must be closed.}
<A>__{he turns to the lieutenant.}
<C>__{derlin}
<D>__{close the doors.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{the lieutenant walks away. chewie lets out a long, mournful howl, somewhat like a coyote. at the same moment, artoo begins a complex series of efficient beeps.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy five... to one.}
<A>__{leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the entrance of the ice cave. the loud booms echo throughout the huge cavern. chewie lets out another suffering howl.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{actually, artoo has been known to make mistakes... from time to time. oh, dear, oh, dear. don't worry about master luke. i'm sure he'll be all right. he's quite clever, you know... for a human being.}
