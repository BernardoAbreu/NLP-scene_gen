<A>__{the remo is now on the night side of mars. cargo boxes, packing cases and assorted equipment containers float outside. the hatch is sealed.}
<L>__{interior remo. mars orbit. night}
<A>__{mcconnell hovers by a bulkhead. he's anguished, haunted by the image of woody's death. we see him struggling to overcome his grief and shock, trying to force himself to concentrate on the critical tasks at hand. in front of him, a panel has been opened; he's facing}
<B>__{small utility monitor}
<A>__{already glowing, surrounded by coded switches, indicator lights, com ports.}
<B>__{mcconnell}
<A>__{stares at these, thinking hard, remembering. he's holding a palm sized computer, already wired into this panel. he begins tapping the keys, but then stops himself. reconsiders. he turns, looking back at}
<B>__{terri and phil}
<A>__{hunched on what would be the floor if the remo were on land. they grip stowage straps to keep from drifting. clearly this tiny, rude cargo craft was never designed for manned operation. it's claustrophobic, bitterly cold. phil's face is a map of torment. he is shivering, both from cold and fear, barely holding himself together. he hugs his computer supply case like a scared child would hug a teddy bear.}
<B>__{terri}
<A>__{is worse. a thousand yard stare. she's in shock.}
<B>__{mcconnell}
<A>__{knows he has to occupy them. speaks softly.}

<D>__{phil?}

<D>__{hey, phil...?}
<A>__{phil looks up at him dully.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{we're going in blind. we'll deploy the chutes by laptop. i need to get on the data bus, put in a software patch, and try to soften this tin can's landing. i could use your help with the patch.}
<A>__{after a moment phil releases his strap, pushes towards mcconnell. he stares numbly at the monitor for a few beats, then takes the little computer from mcconnell. he begins to tap the keys, slowly at first, but then with more confidence.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{that's great. good job.}
<P>__{(turning to terri)}
<D>__{hey, terri, i was wondering. think maybe we could rig some kind of seatbelts out of those cargo straps?}
<A>__{terri hesitates a moment, then looks at the strap in her hand, as if she's never seen it before. dully she reaches for another one, begins looping them together.}
<B>__{mcconnell}
<A>__{studies both of their faces intently. knows that he can't push them too hard, too fast. they're moving like robots, but at least they're moving.}
