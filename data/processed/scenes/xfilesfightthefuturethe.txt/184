<B>__{reverse on this corridor}
<A>__{where mulder is walking past frozen cryopods hanging on a track. each icy pod containing a human body frozen within. partially visible behind clear blue ice. but these are modern men, and women. their expressions a confused horror, as if they have been somehow frozen alive. they are slowly tracking. walking along the slowly moving carousel of frozen humanity. stopping, turning, almost as if having sensed:}

<B>__{camera rising up a frosty wall of blue ice}
<A>__{where a woman's body is encased, its naked features hidden behind the opacity of the newly frozen blue crust. but whose face is unmistakable as that of agent scully's. frozen in a similar expression of far away horror, her eyes cast slightly heavenward.}

<A>__{hastily putting the syringe together, getting the needle poked into the soft rubber cap of the ampule. bleeding the syringe now, the substance inside squirting out of the end of the needle onto the floor of the ship. and the moment it does, the whole floor sizzles like water being dropped onto a hot skillet. spreading out from mulder in every direction. a violent chemical reaction, as predicted by the man who gave him this substance. a moment later the entire structure mulder is in shunts. shuddering violently and setting up a low end rumble. causing mulder to accidentally drop the syringe.}

<A>__{on the floor, where the syringe hits and bounces, but does not break or leak. mulder scrambling into frame to re collect it. seeing the floor where the liquid from the syringe hit where it has been etched away by the substance.}
