<L>__{exterior morning the next day customer service kiosk}
<A>__{robbie and alex are walking by. jaffa sees them.}
<C>__{jaffa}
<D>__{hey, surfer boy! i got fifty bucks at three to one! don't let me down, mon.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(to jaffa)}
<D>__{hey jaffa. no worries.}
<P>__{(to alex, shocked)}
<D>__{people are betting on me?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{just a little friendly pool. no big deal. helps make this more interesting. concessions never had a chance before...}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i've seen this cowboy practice. his style is more longboard, and this is a shortboard wave, but he's still pretty good. i could lose you know.}
<A>__{two concessions girls are walking by them.}
<C>__{concessions girls}
<P>__{(together)}
<D>__{hi robbie!}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{how ya doin'}
<P>__{(to alex after they have gone by)}
<D>__{see. how come everyone knows me by sight now?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{ah, you're the next big thing. you'll survive it. the employee olympics are only a week away. what happens is we have this big opening ceremony where each team chooses a theme and we're judged on our spirit. then different teams compete in contests that test their water world skills. the next morning it all ends with the surf contest. you ready?}
<A>__{another group of concession girls calls robbie from one of the snack bars. he waves.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i suppose. i've been working out a strategy to use if cowboy has a real good day. it's risky...}
<A>__{just then they both nearly run headlong into tiffany.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{well, hello robbie.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(surprised)}

<D>__{i'm alex!}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{yes, i'm sure you are.}
<P>__{(ignoring alex, back to robbie)}
<D>__{it's been a while since i've been to aokee's. do you suppose if i come down in a little while you could make some of that special chicken, what is it?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{the best teriyaki east of the pacific.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{yes...and one those smoothies i hear so much about?}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{well, sure. i will be working all afternoon.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{it's a date then. see you later!}
<A>__{she walks off. robbie just stands there. alex starts walking, then comes back. finally alex pushes him on the shoulder.}
<C>__{alex}
