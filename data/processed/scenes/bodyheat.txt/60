<L>__{exterior lighthouse sand dunes night}
<A>__{the big beacon turns in the distance, throwing an intermittent bridge of light across the water toward us. the undulating dunes stretch off as far as we can see. racine's stingray is parked on the dirt access road. below it, racine and matty sit close in the warm sand.}

<D>__{don't say it, if you don't mean it. please, ned, don't.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i do. i want you with me.}
<A>__{she looks at him a long time. there is real joy in her face. and tears in her eyes. we're very close to those eyes as she wipes the tears away. racine puts an arm around her. she looks out at the lighthouse.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i'm going to tell edmund i want a divorce. i won't stay any longer. i would have, if you hadn't come along. the life is comfortable. i was willing to go on. but you've reminded me of what it can be... i know now that these last three years i've been living half a life. it's my fault, i don't deny it. you have to let yourself be bought. i did. i let it happen. i've lived so much of my life with nothing. when you have no money, you have no choices. i don't care what they say money is freedom. that's something they don't teach you in school. but i found out. and when edmund came along when i saw a chance to stop struggling i took it. i'm not ashamed. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{matty }
<D>__{he got what he wanted... he has a knack for that. but no more. i'm ready to walk away from the money. i have to be with you.}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(kisses her, smiles)}
<D>__{it is conceivable i will make a buck someday.}
<C>__{matty}
<P>__{(hugs him closer)}
<D>__{oh, i know you will, darling. i didn't mean that. i know you will. but it doesn't matter. it's you i want. that's all.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{anyway, you'll come out all right.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{of the divorce?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{yeah. he's ripe.}
<A>__{matty is silent for a long beat.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{no. i signed a pre nuptial agreement.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{he insisted. he blamed it on his sister roz she's always hated me but i know he wanted it too.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{how is it?}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{bad. i get some money for a year. not much. that's it. but i don't care, ned. not if i can be with you.}
<A>__{she searches his face, almost frightened.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{does it matter, ned? tell me the truth please. i will understand, i swear to you.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{the truth? i wish you were going to be loaded. does it matter? no. no. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<A>__{they kiss.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{god, you've made me happy.}
<P>__{(she pulls away)}
<D>__{it's time for your present.}
<A>__{she jumps up and runs back to the car. racine walks back there as matty takes a wrapped package out of the car. she hands it to racine, who leans against the car to unwrap it.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{from now on, when it starts coming down on you, i will be there to protect you.}
<A>__{racine opens the box and smiles broadly. it is a hat a fedora in the classic style.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{put it on! i will bet i guessed the size right.}
<A>__{racine puts on the fedora. it fits. he looks simultaneously old fashioned, a visitor from the forties, and also very chic, a present day fashion plate. but most of all, he looks exactly right. matty squeals in glee at the sight.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i love it.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i want to see.}
<A>__{racine tries to see his reflection in the car's side view mirror but he has trouble. matty, very animated in her delight, steps up and kisses him quickly.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{look in my eyes. can you see yourself?}
<A>__{racine tries for a moment, then gives up with a laugh.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{here!}
<A>__{matty opens the door of the stingray and sits in the passenger seat with her legs out. she rolls up the window in that door as racine stands before it. the glass capture the moonlight to make a perfect mirror. as the window goes up, racine's reflection appears on the glass, posing in his hat. at the same time, matty's face disappears from view.}
