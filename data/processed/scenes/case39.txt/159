<L>__{interior lucy's bedroom night}
<A>__{freezes in the doorway, shocked by what lies before her.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<A>__{black eyes. bloody noses. bruises. cuts. burns. photos of abused children cover the entire floor. a collage of misery. lucy is nowhere to be seen. emily comes in and starts quickly picking them up. tucked between the file cabinet and the wall is a corkboard. emily pulls it out. it's covered with photos from work. coworkers. her kids. two of the photos are turned around. she flips them over in rapid succession. diego. doug. she rips all the photos from the board. photos bunched in her hands, she heads for the door, but hears something that stops her in her tracks a strange intermittent buzzing noise it lasts two seconds and stops. she turns around, scans the room. puts down the stack of photos. there it is again:}
<B>__{bzzzzzzzzzzzt. bzzzzzzzzzzzzt.}
<A>__{sounds like a housefly trapped against a window, but it's bigger, angrier, and appears to be coming from the}
<C>__{knotted rug}
<A>__{at the foot of lucy's bed. emily crosses to it. the buzzing stops. she bends. takes hold of a corner. peels it slowly back to reveal}
<C>__{bare floor}
<A>__{weird. nothing there. bzzzzzzzzzzzzzt! bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt! emily straightens, turns. it's coming from the}
<C>__{bed}
<A>__{as she approaches it the buzzing intensifies, louder, more agitated. pauses as she gets there, terrified of what she might find, the bed buzzing furiously from within. something is trapped under those blankets, waiting for release. emily extends a trembling hand, takes hold of the blankets and, slowly, rigid with fear, peels them back to reveal}
<C>__{bare mattress}
<A>__{impossible, because the buzzing is louder than ever. with a tense swallow emily realizes it's coming from lower, deeper within the bed, between the mattress and the box spring. she slips her fingers into the crack. and slowly lifts the mattress, the buzzing growing frighteningly loud as its source is exposed, something hellish waiting for her as she cranes her neck and look to see what lies below }
<B>__{her cell phone}
<A>__{vibrating. bzzzzzzzzzt. bzzzzzzzzzzt. on the viewscreen: "incoming call..." she picks it up. stares at it vibrating in her hand. presses the talk button. brings it to her ear. the low static of an open line. then, a raspy male voice:}
<C>__{male voice on phone}
<D>__{emily...}
<A>__{emily flinches.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{who is this...?}
<C>__{male voice on phone}
<D>__{it's wayne, emily, i just got a call, mike's dead...}
<A>__{emily, stunned, barely able to speak.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{no... he's...}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{they don't know if he fell or what happened...}
<A>__{emily's phone hand drops to her side in shock. from down there, we hear wayne's voice:}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{emily? emily, are you okay...?}
<A>__{after a moment, she lifts it.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i have to go.}
<A>__{hangs up. on the brink of emotional collapse. her only confidante dead. just then she hears breathing from behind the open door. someone or something hiding in that dark corner over there. she crosses to it. pulls back the door and there sits}
<C>__{lucy}
<A>__{quiet, innocent, chin on her knees.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{what did you do to him?}
<A>__{lucy says nothing. emily grabs her by the arm. yanks her to her feet.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{what did you do to him?!}
<A>__{after a moment:}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{he did it to himself.}
<A>__{whack! emily slaps her. hard across the face. knocks her to the floor. lucy sits up, lip split. tastes the blood with her tongue. hint of a smile. the taste of victory.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{europa. ganymede. io. callisto. the moons of jupiter. we got back our astronomy tests today.}
<A>__{it's there on the floor. a++ well done, lucy! there's a loud beep in the other room. lucy gets up and walks out. emily watches as lucy goes into the kitchen. takes a bag of popcorn from the microwave. empties it into a bowl. sits down on the living room sofa and clicks on the tv remote, watching it like nothing ever happened. emily walks over and pitches the tv onto the floor. the screen shatters.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{get out of my house.}
<A>__{lucy, unimpressed, expressionless, takes another handful of popcorn. chews it. crunch. crunch. crunch. emily swats the bowl from her hands.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{get out!}
<A>__{flicking bits of popcorn off herself, lucy stands up from the sofa. her face catches the light from the hallway. emily shudders at the sight. lucy's features look altered somehow, sharpened. it's subtle, but the overall effect is chilling. the face of a}
<B>__{little girl laid over the musculature of something more devious and wicked.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{don't yell at me. my mom and dad used to yell at me.}
<A>__{emily backs away, mortified, takes off down the hall.}
