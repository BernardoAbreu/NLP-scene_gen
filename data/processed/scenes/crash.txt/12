<A>__{james pumps the brakes and saws away inexpertly at the wheel. he manages to avoid the first two cars, but the third he strikes head on. at the moment of impact, the man in the passenger seat of the other car is propelled like a mattress from the barrel of a circus cannon through his own windshield and then partially through the windshield of james's car. the propelled man's blood spatters james's face and chest, his body coming to rest half inside james's car, its head dangling down into the dark recess of the passenger footwell. james's chest hits the steering wheel, his knees crush into the instrument panel, his forehead hits the upper windshield frame. as this happens, james is vaguely conscious of the same thing happening to the woman driving the other car, as though she is a bizarre mirror image. slammed back into their seats after the initial impact, james and the woman look at each other through the shattered windshields, neither able to move. the woman, handsome and intelligent looking, supported by her seat belt, stares at james in a curiously formal way, as if unsure what has brought them together. out of the corner of his eye, james can see the hand of the dead passenger, now his passenger, caught on the dashboard and lying palm upwards only a few inches away from him. james squints as he tries to focus on a huge blood blister, pumped up by the man's dying circulation, which has a distinct triton shape. james shifts his focus to the hood ornament of his car, twisted up into the cold mercury vapor glare of the roadway lights but still intact. it is the same triton imprinted on the palm of the dead passenger, the car manufacturer's logo.}
