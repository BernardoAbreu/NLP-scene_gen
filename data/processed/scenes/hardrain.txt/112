<A>__{karen is unconscious. wayne has her laying on the stairs leading up from the entry area to the second floor. there's three feet of water in the house. karen's legs are in the water. her hands are handcuffed to a railing attached to the wall, running up the stairs. wayne stands over karen, pats her face.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{wakey wakey.}
<A>__{karen stirs, then starts slipping back into unconsciousness, so wayne splashes her face with water. karen comes to, sputtering. her eyes focus. she looks up at wayne. wayne grins.}

<D>__{dear penthouse: i always thought your letters were fake, until the wildest thing happened to me. i'm a policeman in a small town. in the middle of the big flood last year, i was patrolling the streets in a boat, feeling kind of sorry for myself 'cause it was my birthday and all when i saw the front door to a house was open. i pulled my gun afraid it might be looters. imagine my surprise when, instead of a looter, i find a young woman handcuffed to the railing of her stairs. her name was karen, and ever since she came back from college she'd made it clear she was too good for any of us local folk. now here she was, in handcuffs! i said, "what the heck is going on here, ma'am?" and she said...}
<A>__{karen says nothing. wayne leans in close.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{and she said...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{sorry, wayne, but i'm not playing a part in your sick little play.}
<A>__{wayne pulls his gun, puts it to karen's head.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{you're perfect for the role. i suggest you reconsider.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{or what? you'll kill me? you're gonna do that anyway.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i might get clumsy. it might take a while.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm sure you can hurt me. but it's all going to be the same when i'm dead.}
<A>__{wayne straightens up, looks at her, then launches back into it.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{and she said, "happy birthday, wayne. i've got something for you." well, i'm not stupid. i knew what she wanted to give me and i knew she wanted to give it bad, so i }

<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(looks up at light)}
<D>__{that won't do. man's gotta see what he's doing. 'scuse me.}
<A>__{wayne heads off for the kitchen. the second he's gone...}
<B>__{karen}
<A>__{raises her hips and digs a hand into her pocket and pulls out her swiss army knife. she pries open the big blade. she hears wayne sloshing back toward her. she gets back into the position wayne left her in as...}

<A>__{re enters carrying two burning candles in candle holders.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i got the candles. all's we need is a cake.}
<A>__{he sets the candles down on a dry step above karen's head. he leans in close.}

<D>__{and then she said, "my present's ready and waiting. all's you gotta do is unwrap it."}
<A>__{wayne reaches into the water, undoes karen's rain pants, yanks off her shoes, then pulls off her pants. he throws them over the banister. karen remains passive, blank. wayne takes off his holster; hangs it on the banister. then he pushes his pants down to his ankles. his shirttail is long enough so that we don't have to see his wretched little pecker. he climbs on top of karen in the water, brings his face close to hers.}

<D>__{it was cold and rainy that birthday night, and all i wanted was to get someplace warm and dry. as it turned out, what i really wanted was something warm and wet. wayne grins and closes for a kiss and...}
