<A>__{closeup of a still of kane, aged about sixty five. camera pulls back, showing it is a framed photograph on the wall. over the picture are crossed american flags. under it sits bernstein, back of his desk. bernstein, always an undersized jew, now seems even smaller than in his youth. he is bald as an egg, spry, with remarkably intense eyes. as camera continues to travel back, the back of thompson's head and his shoulders come into the picture.}

<P>__{(wryly)}
<D>__{who's a busy man? me? i'm chairman of the board. i got nothing but time ... what do you want to know?}

<D>__{ we thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word as he was dying }
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{that rosebud? maybe some girl? there were a lot of them back in the early days, and }
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed }
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{you're pretty young, mr. }
<P>__{(remembers the name)}
<D>__{mr. thompson. a fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. you take me. one day, back in 1896, i was crossing over to jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in }
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{ and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off. a white dress she had on and she was carrying a white pastrol and i only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all but i will bet a month hasn't gone by since that i haven't thought of that girl.}
<P>__{(triumphantly)}
<D>__{see what i mean?}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{well, so what are you doing about this "rosebud," mr. thompson.}

<D>__{you know why? she was so }
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{sure, sure.}

<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{it's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.}
<P>__{(his eyes get reflective)}
<D>__{thatcher!}
<A>__{bernstein looks out of the window and keeps on looking, seeming to see something as he talks.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{he never knew there was anything in the world but money. that kind of fellow you can fool every day in the week and twice on sundays!}
<P>__{(reflectively)}
