<A>__{ friends mark and kai mitchell up for a visit. they're playing music for elizabeth on a mini boombox, and kai is applying make up to liz's face. after cheery greetings }
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what're you doing?}
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{oh, she's been looking a little pale lately all cooped up in here, and i just know she'd be mortified if no one had thought to help her out with some lipstick and blush. i know she'll grill me.}
<A>__{matt and mark exchange a look "girls."}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{and of course kai's getting her all caught up on all the latest gossip.}
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{well, i don't want to have to start from scratch later. oh, and matt, on the way here we stopped by and left some more meals in your fridge, all ready to nuke.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{so what's the latest anyway, matt? any updates?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no, no. just more of the same monitoring the swelling, keeping her kidneys and other vitals working, you know, hoping for the best.}
<A>__{kai nods sympathetically before turning back to elizabeth.}
