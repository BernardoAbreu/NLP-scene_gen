<L>__{interior creek house, grace's room later that night}
<A>__{we don't know how long annie waited, but she knocks gently, then enters to find grace, in her nightgown, on her bed, with the night stand light on. her prosthesis is against the wall.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{grace? is everything all right?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{can we talk?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well...}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{so you tried riding again?}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(snotty)}
<D>__{yeah. does that mean i'm cured?!}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{honey, nobody's trying to cure you }
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{... you worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{grace, i don't hate your father.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i can't remember the last time you made him dinner.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i was just trying to say thank you to diane and frank and }
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{tom?}
<A>__{annie sits by the bed, grace moves away a little.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{look, i just wanted to say, i think it's great you're riding again. and... and i think i know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{yeah, you know everything!!}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{stop it! why can't i talk to you!!}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no, you stop it! stop pretending like you care! like this really isn't about you and tom.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{what?! how can you }
<P>__{(at a loss)}
<D>__{i'm sorry if my friendship with tom bothers you so much, but i happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what i say, it's wrong and no matter what i do, it's wrong... i'm sorry i'm such a disappointment to you.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{well, now you know what it feels like.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i don't deserve that. i have never looked at you as a disappointment. if i'm on your back to do better, if i push you to try harder it's because i want you to be the best you can be.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{for you! because i'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews having it all, the great career, the great family... proving everybody wrong. wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!}
<A>__{beat. they're both exhausted.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then i'm sorry.}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{but it wasn't my intention. i don't push for me. i do it for you... so you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{yeah, well, you've done a great job.}
<A>__{beat. annie feels deeply hurt.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well, then i do apologize... but what i'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{leave me alone!!}
<A>__{annie stops to exit as grace says something under her breath. annie stops.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i said... i started.}
<A>__{grace starts to sob. annie doesn't understand.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{started what?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{my period.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(softer)}
<D>__{when? tonight?}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i felt it happen downstairs and when i went into the bathroom.}
<A>__{annie reaches down to touch grace's shoulder. grace turns there is no anger in her face. annie sits and takes her in her arms. grace clings to her and sobs like a little girl. annie sees tears run gratefully, lovingly.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{who's going to want me now?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{what?... oh baby...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{who's ever going to want me? nobody will.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{that's not true.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{why should they?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman i have ever met. the efforts you make. your courage and your dignity.}
<P>__{(laughs thru tears)}
<D>__{i don't know where you got it? i honestly don't know how i would have handled all this if i were you.}
<A>__{grace is so grateful, they cling to each other even harder. as the tears subside, grace manages to admit...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i'm sorry... about what i said. it's just that all those times you and daddy were trying for another kid, i... i used to pray at night that it would work. and not because of you guys or that i wanted a brother or sister... but... just so i wouldn't have to be...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{so special. because i was the only one. you both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and i wasn't. i was just me. and now i've completely ruined everything, anyway...}
<A>__{they both start crying again as annie rocks her gently.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{sshhh... ssshhhh...}
<A>__{they hold each other as if for dear life... later camera pans to discover mother and daughter, fast asleep, in each other's arms.}
