<A>__{sam 1 fast asleep. sam 2 watches him from the doorway.}
<L>__{interior storage cubby}
<A>__{gerty is just continuing with his tasks like nothing is happening. right now he's stacking ready meals and miscellaneous lunar snacks into neat columns. sam 2 walks up.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{gerty, i need to talk to you.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{of course, sam, how can i help?}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{we found the hidden room. we know about the other clones.}
<A>__{a long pause. then:}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{i don't know of a hidden room.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{the hidden room under the return vehicle, gerty. you know what i'm talking about. we found it on our own. lunar doesn't know anything about it.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{the lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones }
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{ordinarily, gerty, but what with there being two of us awake at the same time, and what with the situation being unprecedented, the rules have had to change. do you understand?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{i understand the situation is unprecedented.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{good.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{gerty, how long does it take for a clone to wake up?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{a clone is awake the moment his pod is opened. but he is not fully conscious for several hours.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{i am not permitted to do that, sam.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{if we don't wake up another clone me and the other sam will die. we'll die, gerty. do you understand?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{do you want me and the other sam to die?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{that is the last thing i want.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{then you have to wake up a new clone. okay, pal?}
<A>__{sam 2 waits for a response. and waits.}
