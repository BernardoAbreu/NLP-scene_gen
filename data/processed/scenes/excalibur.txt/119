<L>__{interior passageways, camelot day}
<A>__{echoing in the vaulted corridors outside the hall, the knight's whisper stabs arthur. the words now seem borne on the whistling wind and follow the king wherever he goes in search of merlin. he comes upon a knight seducing a lady in a dark corner by the chapel door, his hand under her gown. arthur notes the sacrilege in silence, and continues on his way.}
<L>__{interior bedchamber day}
<A>__{the wind keens. thunder rolls overhead. arthur enters his bedchamber. he sits by the empty fireplace, a broken man. feminine hands light on his shoulders. he starts. he looks up. it is morgana. he smiles and grasps her hand.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{i will weep for you, brother, for a king must not weep.}
<A>__{she comes around and she kneels in front of him. before he can talk she silences him with a tender caress.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{do you know what guenevere's maids have whispered?}
<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{that when the king returned from battle...}
<A>__{she begins untying the laces of his metal thigh and shin guards.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{...guenevere would unlace his armor and massage the burns where metal rubbed on flesh...}
<A>__{she is stripping his legs naked, gently touching the flesh with her fingertips. he stares off, remembering.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{...she would prepare a bath for you, mixing special ointment in the water...}
<A>__{arthur's eyes brim with tears. morgana weeps, embracing his knees. he rests his hand gently upon her head, choked with remembrance, soothing her. but as she weeps, she incants a charm. arthur looks down upon her, and the woman who looks up at him is guenevere, a guenevere with cold ice eyes. he is made weak by desire and weakened further by magic. he holds her face adoringly.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{guenevere! you are "guenevere" don't speak. a thousand words, a hundred thousand words, would only be prologue to the truth that must be. that you, king, and i, your queen, beget a son to bond our love and to strengthen our weak kingdom with a successor. come, my lord...}
<A>__{she draws him to the floor and upon her body, holding him tightly to himself. arthur trembles with excitement, pathetic in his desperate passion. as he takes her, she shudders, losing control of the charm, and her features change till once again "guenevere" is morgana. she holds him in a tight embrace so that he may not see her. she whispers in his ear.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{the moon flows in my blood to meet your seed. and already i bear him who will be king.}
<A>__{arthur wrenches himself away so he can see her, her arms still around his neck. he looks down upon her, aghast, incredulous.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{i could easily kill you, brother. but i want you to live to see our son be king. in me, the blood of cornwall will have its revenge; in me, the blood of uther will show its dark side.}
<A>__{she presses her thumbs into his neck and he faints.}
