<A>__{in the salon outside the sistine chapel, the camerlengo waits alone. from inside can be heard the sound of voices in debate. finally, the big doors open and cardinal mortati emerges, goes to him.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{my son... god answers all prayers.}
<A>__{he puts a hand on the camerlengo's shoulder.}
<C>__{mortati }
<D>__{but sometimes the answer is no.}
<A>__{the camerlengo closes his eyes this is a terrible, terrible mistake.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{the college will not break conclave.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{we can't hide this anymore. the burning church }
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{a despicable act of terrorism. father simeon will make a suitable announcement lamenting the loss of life. may i suggest you direct your energies to helping the swiss guard confront the possibility of this explosive device, and leave church leadership }
<A>__{he gestures to the open doors to the sistine chapel, and the assembled cardinals within.}

<D>__{ to its leaders.}
<A>__{the camerlengo looks at him for a long moment, then turns and wa1ks away. father simeon, who had been lurking in the open doorway to the chapel, now glides up beside him and touches mortati's arm.}

<A>__{mortati raises an eyebrow, seeing where this is going.}
<C>__{fr. simeon }
<D>__{ thereby making yourself eligible to wear the ring of the fisherman.}
<A>__{mortati looks at him for a moment, then looks back, over his shoulder, where a small knot of cardinals, who have clearly discussed this, are looking at him in confirmation.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{if it is god's will, may his will be done.}
