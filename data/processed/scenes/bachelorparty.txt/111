<D>__{no sob story is going to change my mind.}
<A>__{mr. thomerson pushes o'neill aside and enters the bedroom.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{the phone's all yours.}
<A>__{mr. thomerson, in the bedroom, picks up the receiver. as he does so, a cloud of cocaine falls out of the mouthpiece. he screams at rick, gesturing with the phone in his hand as he dials. each move produces a large cloud of powder, which causes him to sniffle slightly.}
<C>__{mr. thomerson}
<D>__{i never liked you. i've never liked any of your friends. i've hated you from the first time i saw you. and now you are out of my life. you are out of my life!}
<A>__{he starts to react from inhaling the powder. he puts the receiver to his ear. he takes a deep breath and tries to dial another number. a large cloud of coke flies up his nose. he's stunned. he takes another deep drag. he's hooked. he forgets all about dialing. he jams the receiver against his nose and takes deep drag after deep drag. desiree, still wearing her leather mask, crosses to him and sits down next to him on the bed. he gives her a big, wide smile. o'neill closes the door.}

<D>__{reach out and snort someone.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i'm saved. let's party!}
