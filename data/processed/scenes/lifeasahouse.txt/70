<L>__{exterior george's shack morning}
<A>__{george is removing the last of the windows, carefully prying it out of the casement as robin pulls up in her range rover. she steps out dressed in levi's, boots and a t shirt, carrying a large bag.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{lunch.}
<A>__{she smiles and walks toward george, dropping the food sack on the patio table.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's not breakfast yet.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i dreamed about your house last night.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{finished or unfinished?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{it was perfect, george. amazing. it was so real.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{that wasn't a dream. that was sam.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh...with his ear infection!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{my tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.}
<A>__{george isn't quite sure how to take her comment. finally, he points to the garage.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{go in there and lick his attitude.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{the antibiotics weren't working.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's what i believe, george.}
<A>__{george stares at robin for a second before he nods.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you were wrong about the first year, you know?}
<A>__{it takes robin a second to understand he's saying he loved her when they married.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i've been wrong a lot in my life.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{hindsight. it's like foresight without a future.}
<A>__{robin almost smiles; george confessing love ten years dead.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i have three hours before i pick up adam and ryan.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{where will i be most useful?}
<A>__{robin glances around, assessing the best use of her time.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{with your hands or your tongue?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you're not well.}
<A>__{robin picks up a pile of splintered board and tosses them in the garbage bin. george nods...he's not.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{robin and george carry a twelve foot beam from inside the shack and set it down on cinder blocks. both look exhausted as they head back in for another beam. sam saunters out of the garage in shorts, sits down on the patio chair and opens the sack his mother had packed for lunch. he pulls out a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and starts eating as george and robin emerge from the shack with another beam.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{robin and george set the beam down and turn to sam as they both wipe sweat off their faces. sam chews his sandwich, ignoring them both.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i'm late.}
<A>__{robin walks close to sam, trying to capture his attention.}
<C>__{robin }
<D>__{ryan has a game later. he asked if you'd come and watch.}
<A>__{sam glances up at his mother, just long enough to let her know he hates her, then drops the sandwich and walks back into the garage. a city inspector's car pulls to a stop on the street and bob larson steps out with a clipboard. robin passes him as she walks back to her range rover.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{mr. stevens?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i've been dreading you.}
<A>__{bob and george shake hands as robin drives off.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{bob larson. do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{a violation?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{oh, yes.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{and if i enclosed it?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{an exhaust system or a window is code.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{a sink?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{allowed outside the enclosed area.}
<A>__{sam walks out of the garage in long pants and a shirt.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{where is it?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{a friend of yours is here.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{did you got through my pants?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i might have a solution.}
<A>__{george grabs his chain saw and walks to the garage with sam and bob in tow.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{where'd you put it?!}
