<T>__{match cut to:}
<L>__{interior dragon mountain dawn}
<C>__{present day}
<A>__{hiccup's face, with the matching scar.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{you and your father nearly died that night, all because i couldn't kill a dragon.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{yeah, it runs in the family.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{it broke my heart to stay away, but i believed you'd be safer if i did.}
<A>__{hiccup considers this, then raises his eyes to hers, seeing the sting of remorse.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{how did you survive?}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{oh, cloudjumper never meant to harm me. he must've thought i belonged here...}
<A>__{she leads him to the edge of raised natural terrace, overlooking the steamy oasis with its flowing hot spring waterfalls. half submerged in the warm lake below, a massive white dragon with pronounced, mammoth like tusks rests benevolently on the banks, his stately countenance like that of a lion surrounded by his pride.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{in the home of the great bewilderbeast. the alpha species. one of very few that still exist.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{every nest has its queen, but this is king of all dragons.}
<A>__{dragons land and bow reverentially to the bewilderbeast. valka gestures to the spiked ice ceiling that acts as a sweating greenhouse.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{with his icy breath, this graceful giant built our nest. a safe haven for dragons everywhere.}
<A>__{on hiccup, putting it together.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{wait, that's the ice spitter? he's responsible for all that destruction?}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{he protects us. we all live under his care. and his command.}
<A>__{they pass an eggshell littered nursery. hatchlings dart out of it, greeting them excitedly and inciting chaos. toothless is overwhelmed by their manic picking and scratching. cloudjumper balks and sends them scattering.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{all but the babies, of course...}
<A>__{the hatchlings clamber on top of the bewilderbeast and play on his massive tusks, despite his authority. valka laughs.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{... who listen to no one.}
<A>__{the bewilderbeast lets out a frosty snort, sending off the youngsters to spread more mischief. now awakened, the bewilderbeast raises his gargantuan head to take a closer look at hiccup, coming eye to massive eye. valka bows in his presence. as does toothless.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{i've lived among them for twenty years, hiccup, learning their ways, discovering their secrets...}
<A>__{he acknowledges hiccup with another icy snort, slicking back hiccup's hair in a frosty veneer. valka laughs.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{he likes you.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{she chuckles, delighting in his awe.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{you must be hungry.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{uh, yeah. i could eat.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{good. it's feeding time.}
<A>__{toothless tucks himself beneath cloudjumper's wing, trying to befriend him, but cloudjumper isn't having any of it. he grimaces and follows valka out.}
