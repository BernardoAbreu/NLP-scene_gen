<A>__{a winded fletcher joins virginia at the respondent's table,}
<C>__{virginia}
<D>__{you look like you're having a rough morning.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{i've had better.}
<A>__{he winces as he recognizes the words. then, an extremely wealthy, respectable industrialist, richard cole enters with his attorney, dana appleton, young, brisk, confident.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{good morning, fletcher.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{dana. "}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{all right, virginia, how much will it take to put an end to this?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{fifty per cent of your estate.}
<A>__{richard is shocked.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{fifty per cent? with a pre nup and proof of adultery? what's your case?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{our case is simply this. . .}
<A>__{fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her but he can't get the words out. he tries to force out sounds, but succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{interesting, though based on your track record, i expected a little more.}
<A>__{nearing panic, fletcher whirls to his briefcase and grabs the brief.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{wa it! wait! i've got it in writing!}
<A>__{but when dana tries to take the document, the astonished fletcher finds himself physically unable to release it.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{let go!}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{i'm trying!}
<A>__{he involuntarily snatches the document away and it pulls him to a nearby trash can where he throws it out. at this moment the bailiff calls.}
<C>__{bailiff}
<D>__{all rise for the honorable judge william stevens.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{very funny, fletcher. you want to play hardball, i'm game.}
<A>__{judge stevens takes the bench.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{calling case ba 09395, richard cole versus virginia cole. how're we doing this morning, counsel?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{fine, thank you.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{and you, mr. reid?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{well, i'm a little upset about a bad sexual episode i had last night }
<A>__{fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what he just said. after an awkward silence }
<C>__{judge stevens}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{well, you're still young. it'll happen more and more. in the meantime, what do you say we get. down to business? first, mr. reid, i see that your client was previously represented by mr. rand of your office.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{yes, your honor.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{i take it you're seeking to substitute in as counsel?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{yes, your honor.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{fine , fine. and for the record, the reason is?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{mr. rand had severe ethical objections to my client's case.}
<A>__{fletcher is incredulous. somehow his greatest asset in the world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{i take it you don't share the same ethical objections, mr. reid?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{i have lower standards, your honor.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{i see. well, if mrs. cole wants the substitution of counsel, i will allow it. is that what you want, mrs. cole?}
<A>__{virginia looks to the judge, then to fletcher, whose unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier.}
<C>__{virginia}
<P>__{(unsure)}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{virginia}
<P>__{(aside, to fletcher)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<P>__{(to judge, with some desperation)}
<D>__{your honor, i'd like a continuance!}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{this case has already been delayed several times, mr. reid.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{i realize that, your honor, but i ' d really, really, really like a continuance.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{i will have to hear good cause, counselor. what's the problem?}
<A>__{fletcher's p.o.v. the room begins to spin slowly then faster then faster until we wind up squarely on fletcher's face}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{i can't lie!}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{commendable, mr. reid, but i'm still waiting for the good caus e. now, do you have it or not?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(truthful)}
<D>__{not.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{motion for a continuance denied. is there any chance of a settlement in this case?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{i don't think so, your honor. mr. reid made it abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to }
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{settle! settle! settle!}
<A>__{dana and mr. cole look at fletcher with surprise.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{there appears to have been a change in strategy. let's go to my chambers and negotiate.}
<A>__{he bangs the gavel.}
