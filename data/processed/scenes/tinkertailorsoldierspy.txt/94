<A>__{a fire burns in the little grate. roach sits near the back of the class. the boy behind slaps the back of his neck with a ruler. roach flinches but doesn't say anything. the boy does it again. prideaux drops a pile of books onto the desk of a boy }

<D>__{hand those out.}
<A>__{he crosses to the board begins to write on it je m'appelle monsieur ell... behind him spikely hands out the books, continuing to walk like a hunchback. the class snigger. prideaux hears but doesn't turn, continues writing. then from the chimney comes an unnerving scrabbling sound. a little soot falls... the sniggering fades out as all eyes turn nervously to the fire... what is that noise? then, with a terrifying screech, an owl drops down into the grate, thrashes in the flames before flapping out into the class, its wings now on fire, shrieking hideously, headed straight for spikely who stands frozen in shock as the bird swoops towards his face. then... ... somehow, prideaux is there and grabs the burning bird from the air and in a second has it folded in on itself, neck snapped, and strides out of the room with it. the boys stare after their new teacher in shocked silence.}
