<L>__{exterior craigie porch craigie and the kid night}
<A>__{the two men are sitting just outside the kitchen, where mrs. craigie and christian are pasting labels on the mason jars they filled earlier. the paste and some of the jars are just inside an open window on a shelf behind the men's heads. the light comes from a kerosene lamp inside.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{let me get this straight in my head. cards is all a matter of luck, who gets dealt the best ones.}
<A>__{the kid stands up and selects six playing cards from a deck in his pocket. during the next few lines he uses the paste on the shelf to stick together three pairs of them so as to form three double thick cards. one of these has two faces, another two backs, and the third a back and a face.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{so when one of you professional gamblers sits down with a bunch of your what do you call them customers, clients?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{the technical term is "suckers." or "marks."}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{their chance of winning is just as good as yours, except if you got a way to control it, who gets what cards. right?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{not right. that's cheating and it's not any part of what we're talking about.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{then how do you win?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i will show you.}
<A>__{he displays his three cards.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{you see one of these cards is white on both sides, one is red on both sides, and the other is white on one side, red on the other.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{what about it?}
<A>__{the kid lifts a straw hat off a peg on the porch wall.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{this. i put the three cards in a hat and shake them up, and then i ask you to draw one card out blind. put it face down on the table so neither of us can see the bottom side.}
<A>__{craigie does as instructed. the ensuing dialogue assumes the card he picks is red on top; if it's white the words "red" and "white" will be reversed in the dialogue.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{okay, red on top. that eliminates the all white card, right. so the card you've picked is one of two the all red or the red and white. one out of two is an even chance, an even money proposition. right you follow me?}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{so if i said i will bet you a dollar to seventy five cents the other side of that card is red, you'd take the bet wouldn't you?}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{seems like. yeah.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{and that answer makes you a sucker. because the odds are two to one, the other side of that card is red, and i ought to be offering you a dollar to fifty cents instead of seventy five.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{but if there are just the two possibilities.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{there are three possibilities.}
<P>__{(indicating card on table)}
<D>__{that can be the red side of the red and white card, or it can be either side of the all red card. in two cases out of three the other side is red. and i'd win the bet from you two out of every three times we made it.}
<C>__{craigie}
<P>__{(dubiously)}
<D>__{you would?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{sure. it's obvious when i explain it, isn't it?}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{reckon so. except if there's only two things that the bottom side can be, red or white }
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{take my word for it the odds are two to one. and knowing that is the difference between your gambling man and your sucker. not who gets the better cards but who knows what the proper odds are. in a poker game there can be a million different situations, each with a different set of odds to figure. the man who ends up winners is the man who knows when to bet and how much...}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{the sucker is still took advantage of, isn't he? the gambler knows something he don't know.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{sure like if you grow better corn or raise a cow that gives more milk than the other guy's. or two business men are in competition, or two lawyers are up against each other in a courtroom. whatever your line is, the one who wins out is the one who knows his job better.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{seems like there should be something else to it }
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{there is making the man you're playing against think he's got the best hand and making him pay to find out.}
<P>__{(time lapse)}
