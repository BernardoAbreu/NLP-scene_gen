<P>__{(deeply grateful)}
<D>__{but you never doubted who i was, did you, dmitri? not for a second ...}
<A>__{anya gratefully kisses dmitri an the cheek and runs into the house. vladimir, who's been watching, has a warning.}

<D>__{life is funny, isn't it. you find the right girl ... and then you lose her.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{dmitri ... you must understand that once you take her to tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. she's a princess and you're a commoner.}
<A>__{dmitri understands this and is devastated. vladimir pats him on the back as he walks into the house. music begins: bright, exciting, paris in the twenties anya and dmitri, followed by vlad and sophie are walking down the champs elysees. meetoo trots along after them, happily. they walk by an accordion player and a lady flower seller, who watch them and whisper to each other.}

<A>__{"paris holds the key to your heart" (production number) in uptempo "paris in the twenties style music, the people of paris all sing, welcoming anya and dmitri, sophie and vlad, to paris! the foursome explores the city and anya has the happiest day of her young life. on the streets they encounter the motley denizens of paris, as well as people with very familiar faces for anyone in the audience in the know, they'll see josephine baker, maurice chevalier, rodin, gertrude stein, freud, lindbergh people who were in paris in the twenties.. for those in the audience who don't recognize them, they'll simply be unidentified fascinating "types" who sing. as the joyous number progresses, we realize that dmitri is feeling something else the impending loss of anya to a world where she clearly is at home. he sings for a short moment, knowing that he's about to lose her. anya visits a couturier and comes out with a big dress box for her evening at the ballet. a big finale as they go off for the evening. even meetoo has found some female poodle companionship. but for one last beat, dmitri's wistfulness cuts against joy.}
