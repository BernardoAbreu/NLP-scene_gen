<L>__{interior rotunda day}
<A>__{a sword master advances towards us with determination, his sword flashing. he is fighting an adversary we do not see, and comments his movements.}
<C>__{master}
<D>__{si! si! muy bien! excellente!}
<P>__{(yes! yes! good! excellent!)}
<A>__{we discover the sword master is fencing with columbus. a dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda, surrounded with a two tiered colonnade. out of breath, columbus stops the exercise, and removes his protective canvas padding. he bows at his teacher, who salutes him in return. columbus walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages. sanchez, in a fencing outfit and boots, is having a glass of wine. upon seeing columbus approaching, he hands him a glass.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{you defend yourself admirably...}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{... for a commoner?}
<A>__{sanchez laughs and raises his glass.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{to your second expedition.}
<A>__{they drink. a short, somewhat ugly man, with some kind of imposing energy, approach them.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{don colon don alonso de bobadilla. a man who knows our laws.}
<A>__{bobadilla bows.}
<C>__{bobadilla}
<D>__{i understand that you will soon be appointing governors for the islands? is it not so?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{forgive me, don bobadilla those positions have already been taken.}
<C>__{bobadilla}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{may i ask by whom?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{bartolome and giacomo colon.}
<A>__{sanchez looks at him in surprise. bobadilla reddens.}
<C>__{bobadilla}
<D>__{i trust they are men of quality.}
<A>__{bobadilla glances at sanchez.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{but we do have a lack of notaries. you should contact my administration.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{don bobadilla is already a judge, my dear don cristobal.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{good! we are also in need of judges. except there are no thieves!}
<A>__{a grin disfigures the face of bobadilla.}
<C>__{bobadilla}
<P>__{(to sanchez)}
<D>__{i see i was mistaken. don colon has no need for my services...}
<A>__{and he walks off. sanchez fills his mouth with a slice of ham.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{you seem to have a special talent for making friends.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{what...? do i have so many already?}
<C>__{sanchez}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{to rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.}
<P>__{(kindly)}
<D>__{a little hypocrisy goes a long way.}
