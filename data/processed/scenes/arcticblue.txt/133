<A>__{her visitor, whoever it is, is behind the turtle. anne marie cautiously rounds the corner and stops dead.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{a foraging grizzly sniffs around, attracted by the smell of fresh carrion wilder. eight feet tall and eleven hundred pounds, it's used to having its way. right now, it's hungry. with a casual swipe of its paw, its massive claws puncture the turtle's aluminum skin, popping open the door of the utility compartment. the bear pokes its head inside, and wilder's body slumps out into the snow. the bear pushes at the corpse with its snout. salivating, it prepares to dig in. anne marie looks around, wondering what the hell to do nexterior wilder's snowmobile is a few yards behind her, parked against the side of the turtle. she inches toward it. testily, the bear looks up, sniffing loudly. keeping her eyes on the bear, anne marie feels for the snowmobile ignition keys. they're not there. she feels around inside the saddlebags and finds three emergency road flares. anne marie ignites the flares. they illuminate the area with an eerie reddish glow. she yells at the bear, wields the flares like excalibur and moves forward. the bear, reluctant to leave so hearty a pre hibernation meal, growls and cocks its head back and forth to assess the threat. as anne marie inches ahead, the bear stands on hind legs to its full height to meet the challenge. anne marie tosses a flare toward the bear. it grunts when the flare hits it, and shuffles backwards. anne marie throws another flare. with a roar from hell, the bear charges. anne marie falls back. still holding the last flare, she's forced into a crawl space under the turtle. angle under the turtle anne marie tries to squeeze out the other side, but she's pinned in by the unevenness of the hard ground. the bear swipes at her, its huge paw inches away. anne marie jabs at the paw with the flare, but that only makes the bear more quarrelsome. she twists around, looking for a defense. above her is the cabling from the generator to the circuit box for the turtle's electrical system. she tugs at it, but it won't budge. the bear sniffs at anne marie with its big wet snout. anne marie notices warning a sign on a control valve:}
<D>__{? danger!! ? black water ? untreated sewage}
<A>__{grimacing, she tries to turn the valve. after much effort, it snaps and opens, releasing a stream of fetid sewage.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{the bear gets a muzzle full of the stuff. howling unhappily, it backs away, grunting and sneezing. greatly offended, its appetite gone, it lopes into the forest. anne marie squirms out from under the turtle and, gagging from the horrible smell, pulls off her wet parka.}
