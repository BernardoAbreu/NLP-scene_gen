<L>__{interior country inn night}
<A>__{a large warm tavern with a roaring fire. present are the innkeeper, his wife, a few benighted travelers and three barmaids. they turn as the door flies open and the musketeers and d'artagnan enter from a raging storm. they keep their cloaks drawn about them and wear the brims of their hats pulled low to cover their faces. the occupants of the inn regard the new arrivals with suspicion. outisde, the storm blows. d'artagnan closes the heavy door. fearful, the innkeeper comes forward to meet the four ominous travelers.}
<C>__{innkeeper}
<D>__{good evening.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{see to our horses and bring us some food.}
<C>__{innkeeper}
<P>__{(apologetic)}
<D>__{i'm sorry but we have little to spare. the cardinal's guards were here today. they helped themselves to our food and then refused to pay.}
<C>__{aramis}
<P>__{(bitter)}
<D>__{in the name of god, i'm sure.}
<A>__{porthos is on the lookout for danger. he reaches inside his cloak for a weapon and, in doing so, accidentally exposes his musketeer tunic.}
<D>__{barmaid #1}
<P>__{(crying out)}
<D>__{musketeers!}
<A>__{the sound of sliding steel as athos, porthos, aramis and d'artagnan draw their swords, ready to fight. they stand back to back in a circle, ready for attack. but there is no attack. quite the contrary. the people here are thrilled to see them.}
<C>__{innkeeper}
<P>__{(honored)}
<D>__{musketeers in my house! gentlemen, put away your swords and come in. anyone who fights the cardinal is welcome here.}
<A>__{the musketeers lower their swords.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i think we've found a home.}
<A>__{the musketeers return their swords to their sheathes and take off their dripping hats and capes. the pretty barmaids crowd around them to collect their gear and carry it to the fire.}
<C>__{innkeeper}
<D>__{we don't have much but what we have is yours.}
<A>__{porthos rubs his hands together, eager to indulge himself. he follows the barmaids, booming in his loud, friendly voice.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{ladies, you're in for a treat tonight. allow me to introduce myself. i'm the musketeer they call porthos.}
<A>__{porthos beams, waiting for a big response but nothing happens. the barmaids look at each other.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(repeating; louder)}
<D>__{porthos.}
<A>__{still no response. aramis and d'artagnan hide smiles.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{it's hard to believe they haven't heard of the great porthos.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{oh, shut up, aramis.}
<A>__{the three barmaids perk up.}
<C>__{barmaids}
<P>__{(with excitement)}
<D>__{aramis? did you say aramis?}
<A>__{and with that, the three barmaids desert porthos and scurry across the room to attach themselves to aramis. porthos shakes his head and flops down in a chair.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i don't get it. i just don't get it.}
