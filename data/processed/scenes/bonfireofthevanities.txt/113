<C>__{arthur}

<A>__{angle waiters later are bringing the main course to the table. arthur is guzzling wine as he talks. peter is bored silly.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{... but the best is just a few weeks ago, one of these jackass pilots, he lands long and the plane goes off the runway. i was there. i was on the plane. we're going into mecca, see. and the plane is full of arabs and all these animals sheep, goats, chickens. they won't travel without their animals. we had to put plastic in the cabins. you know, they urinate, they defecate...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{anyway, the plane goes off the runway and we hit the sand with a hell of a jolt and the right wing tip digs into the sand and the plane skids around in a circle! 360 degrees before we stop! we're scared shitless. panic. and we look into the cabin and there's everybody calm, quiet, they're picking up their luggage and their animals and they're looking out the window at the little fire that started on the wing and they're waiting for the doors to open like nothing happened. and then it dawns on me. they think this is normal!}
<A>__{he starts to laugh as he talks.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{they think this is the way you stop an airplane.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{you stick one wing in the sand and you spin around until you stop.}
<P>__{(coughing as he laughs harder and harder)}
<D>__{what do they know? they never rode in an airplane. they think this is how you do it!}
<A>__{peter tries to laugh with arthur. but arthur's coughing turns into a spasm. he pushes his head back against the banquette. he seems to be humming. and then his head drops forward and he slumps against peter.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{arthur? arthur?}
<A>__{he tries to signal a waiter.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{excuse me. hello? excuse me. waiter!!!}
<A>__{the maitre d' approaches the table.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{mr. ruskin seems to have suffered some kind of well, i don't know.}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<P>__{(very disappointed)}
<D>__{oh, dear. oh, dear. oh, dear.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i think you'd better call someone.}
<A>__{arthur drops forward suddenly, his face hitting his plate. a woman at the next table squeals.}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{freddy? attention, s'il vous plait!}
<A>__{two waiters help the maitre d' pull the table out. arthur slips off his plate and falls onto the floor. some people notice. but, in general, the activity in the room continues. the maitre d' gives orders to the waiters. a man approaches peter.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{is he choking? let me give him the heimlich maneuver.}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<D>__{excuse me, monsieur roberts. you are not a doctor. and there are legal complications.}
<C>__{mr. roberts}
<D>__{yes, i see, but...}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<D>__{for your own protection and mine and my restaurant, we leave monsieur ruskin in the hands of god and we go back to our escargots.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, somebody has to do something.}
<A>__{peter tries to perform the heimlich maneuver on ruskin.}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<D>__{we have called the police. an ambulance is coming. there is nothing more we can do. would you like some coffee or dessert?}
<C>__{mr. roberts}
<P>__{(to peter)}
<D>__{gee, buddy. i think he's dead.}
<A>__{peter lets go of ruskin. ruskin slides to the floor dead.}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<D>__{eh, voila.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{jesus.}
