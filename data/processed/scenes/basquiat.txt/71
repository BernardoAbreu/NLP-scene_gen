<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{hey it's the big a.m..}
<C>__{albert milo}
<D>__{rene's been telling me about your work.}
<A>__{milo takes his time looking at the paintings. jean continues to work, never wanting to appear impressed by anyone. he walks on top of the paintings.}
<C>__{albert milo }

<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{albert milo}

<D>__{how about now?}
<A>__{rene shrugs to jean. he prepares to leave.}
<C>__{albert milo}
<D>__{see you at your opening. thanks.}
<A>__{albert and rene begin to ascend the stairs. jean continues painting. the dog leaves with rene and albert.}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{ohhh, albert milo, what a pleasure to meet you.}
<A>__{jean's brush stops.}
<C>__{albert milo }
<D>__{this is rene ricard.}
<A>__{jean paints over the words "rene 5:11." we hear footsteps coming down the stairs. the woman continues }
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{we're tom and cynthia kruger nice to have met you.}
<A>__{jean's pov we see annina's legs coming down the stairs.}
<B>__{reveal}
<A>__{a man wearing a pin striped suit and gold rimmed glasses. the woman is wrapped in a cashmere shawl.}
<C>__{annina nosei }
<D>__{tom and cynthia kruger.}
<C>__{basquiat }
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{we see that jean continues to paint, looking down.}
<C>__{annina nosei}
<D>__{this is jean michel basquiat.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you've seen the samo graffiti everywhere. that's his. this is the true voice of the gutter.}
<A>__{as she speaks, jean squirms. he grabs a banana from a fruit bowl. without peeling it, he takes a big bite. and another. and another. everyone looks uncomfortable. annina starts showing them the paintings.}
<C>__{cynthia kruger}
<D>__{we've seen the graffiti. i work on wall street. and i've heard wonderful things about the paintings. everybody's talking about you.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he looks up at them, eating the banana.}
<C>__{annina nosei}
<D>__{here's a very good example of his recent work that's not spoken for yet.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he's got to work in a basement. he's got so much energy that if he worked in a place with a window, he'd jump right through it. most of these are reserved already. after this week, this work will not be available.}
<C>__{tom kruger}
<P>__{(to his wife)}
<D>__{... i don't know.... this one's nice, but i don't know if i could live with it. that green is so... institutional.}
<A>__{he (kruger) looks up to see two kids enter young black artists, one of whom we saw with rene at the loft party. they walk right into the middle of the room, completely oblivious to the presence of annina and the krugers..}
<D>__{kid #1}
<P>__{(enthusiastically)}
<D>__{yo, man, you're a damn lucky nigger selling this shit!}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{you like it? kid #1 not bad. yeah, i do.}
<A>__{the krugers hem and haw in front of the painting next to jean.}
<C>__{cynthia kruger}
<D>__{i'm fascinated by his choice of crossing out words that way.}
<C>__{annina nosei}
<D>__{yes, well, they are more meaningful in their absence, no? kid #1}
<P>__{(to jean, joking)}
<D>__{what does it mean?}
<A>__{jean paints the words "rene 5:11" back into a painting. they ignore the kid..}
<C>__{cynthia kruger}
<D>__{i like this one, but that green...}
<A>__{suddenly, we see legs coming down the stairs. it's gina. everyone looks at her.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{y'want me to make it a nice shit brown?}
<C>__{tom kruger}
<D>__{beg pardon?}
<A>__{gina hadn't expected to find herself in the middle of this scene.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{hi. this is gina.}
<A>__{annina nods to her. gina nods to the group.}
<C>__{cynthia kruger}
<D>__{they're something like dubuffet's... that... childlike quality.}
<A>__{gina tries to connect with jean. he's cold.}
<C>__{cynthia kruger }
<P>__{(to her husband and annina)}
<D>__{i can't make up my mind.}
<C>__{tom kruger}
<D>__{i like this one. if it were just another color..}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{get a fucking decorator. if you buy one, you'll have to change your whole lives maybe even sell your kids!}
<P>__{(to annina)}
<D>__{these paintings aren't even done yet!!!}
<A>__{he sets his brush down. as he leaves }
<C>__{tom kruger }
<D>__{i think we'll take the green one.}
