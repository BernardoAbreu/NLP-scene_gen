<L>__{exterior ned's house morning}
<A>__{ned glances at the white van parked in the driveway, then takes note of his wife's silver mercedes... sitting on floor jacks, the hood raised, tools spread out around it.}
<L>__{interior house the kitchen morning}
<A>__{ned enters. lana wears a diaphanous dressing gown, buttoned unevenly, hair disheveled. she smokes a cigarette.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{morning sweetheart.}
<A>__{ned kisses her on the back of the neck as he passes through the kitchen on his way to the dining room. she reacts with bored, contemptuous disinterest, picking up the coffee pot.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{uh huh. want some coffee?}
<A>__{ned steps back into the kitchen with his briefcase.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{ned sees frank sitting at the kitchen table, hair messed up, coveralls hastily pulled on inside out. frank is reading a copy of insurance digest magazine. a headline on the cover touts an article: "life insurance for your cat!... cover all nine lives for the price of one!" ned's smile fades.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{frank here was just grabbing a little before going back to work on my car.}
<A>__{he steps over to the table... gives frank a cool stare.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{how long you been working on lana's mercedes, frank?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{oh... i don't know... six, seven weeks.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{and ya still haven't found the problem?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(a leering smile)}
<D>__{think i got my finger on it though.}
<A>__{ned turns to lana.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i know what he's doing, lana. i wasn't born yesterday. he's not fixing your car. he's screwing you!}
<A>__{lana tenses up at this. frank freezes. he figures they've been busted. he sits there, holding the magazine, not moving a muscle... as ned turns on him.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{you are screwing my wife! i can see what your game is, frank. you open up her hood, poke around in there... squirt some lubrication in... play around with all her parts... then take an old used piston and stick it in... then pull it out... in, out, in, out! every day! there's no end to it. you just keep coming and coming!... and the bill just gets bigger and bigger!}
<A>__{lana braces herself against the sink, breathless... turned on by ned's description. ned goes to her, sympathetic.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{but you don't see it, do you, lana? you're too good... too pure. you can't see the evil in people like him.}
<P>__{(turns to frank)}
<D>__{well, you're not getting away with it, pal. i'm pulling the plug! you're fired!}
<C>__{lana}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{ned... don't you have to be somewhere?}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(checks his watch)}
<D>__{oh... yeah. thanks, honey. i'm late for court.}
<A>__{he goes to kiss her mouth and she turns her cheek to him. he looks at her lovingly... touches her face tenderly.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{you are so naive.}
<A>__{he picks up his briefcase, gives frank a nasty look, then exits thru the back door. lana and frank stare at each other lustfully, really hot now! frank sweeps the dishes off the table with his arm. lana leaps into his arms, wrapping her legs around his waist. he lays her down on the kitchen table, standing over her. suddenly, ned opens the back door, glaring right at frank... not even noticing lana on the table.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{finish your coffee... then get out!}
<A>__{he slams the door. a beat. lana and frank begin to devour each other with passionate kisses. another beat. the front doorbell rings once... then again.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{just the postman. he always rings twice.}
<B>__{omit}
<A>__{sequence from original script.}
