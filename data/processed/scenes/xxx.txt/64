<L>__{exterior prague riverfront night}
<A>__{it's late. yorgi and xander stroll along the river.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you got a great set up here yorgi. you really know how to live.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{it's a beautiful town, prague. it's been good to me.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i've been here before, when i was a kid. my old man was in the service, we used to live on the army base in hamburg.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{you, an army brat? i don't see that one at all. did you join the service as well?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{hell no. my dad was a straight up tin soldier. somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. had a court martial and everything. the charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{my old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. so he swallowed a bullet. me, i don't believe in nothing i can't see and touch.}
<A>__{the camera suddenly zooms across the city, flying over streets and houses until, half a mile away, it finds kirill in a window with his sniper rifle. p.o.v. through scope xander's head is in the crosshairs. the scope pans over to yorgi, who looks into camera and gives a small signal, calling off the hit.}
<B>__{back on yorgi and xander}
<A>__{yorgi looks up at a "prague peace conference" banner.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{next week these idiots are having a peace conference here. what the hell are they going to talk about? it's the system itself that causes all the world's problems. you're okay, buddy. come on, it's getting early.}
<A>__{they stroll off and kirill stands down.}
