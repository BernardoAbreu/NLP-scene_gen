<L>__{interior jordan's manhattan apartment library day}
<A>__{(oct `92) with nicholas seated in a chair, jordan sits across from him. pacing behind him is donnie, coked up, face contorted, frothing with rage. nearby, giant chester ming sits quietly, saying nothing.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i just want my stuff back, okay?}
<C>__{nicholas the butler}
<D>__{i didn't take anything.}
<C>__{donnie}
<P>__{(in his face)}
<D>__{i should kill you, cocksucker! you do not fuck with this man!}
<A>__{jordan holds donnie off. turns back to nicholas.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you were high, things got out of control, i get it. believe me i do, i have a phd in debauchery.}
<C>__{nicholas the butler}
<D>__{i didn't do it.}
<C>__{donnie}
<D>__{i will knock your fuckin' teeth out, motherfucker!}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{just give me the money, give me the jewelry, and we'll forget the whole thing.}
<C>__{nicholas the butler}
<D>__{it's because i'm gay, isn't it?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{nicholas. you could fuck a baby sheep as far as i care, on my brand new fucking sofa. what i won't stand for is being robbed.}
<C>__{nicholas the butler}
<D>__{i'm telling you the truth.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i will ask you one last time.}
<C>__{donnie}
<D>__{you're dead, you piece of shit!}
<C>__{nicholas the butler}
<D>__{jordan, please.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{jordan nods to chester. without a word, he crosses to nicholas and bammm!! nicholas's nose splits open like a ripe plum, blood spurting everywhere. tough guy donnie takes one look, then spews vomit into a garbage pail. and as chester pummels nicholas's face into chopped meat...}
<D>__{jordan (v.o.) (cont'd) it's amazing the kind of loyalty money will buy. i mean chester almost killed this prick.}
<A>__{chester starts to hang nicholas over the balcony by his legs. jordan stops him.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{i finally called the cops, mainly to save nicholas's life.}
