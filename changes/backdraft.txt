<ACTION>__{It's hard, but we get a sense of the room in the whipping beam of light. Huge, dark coats lined up like sides of beef on steel batons. Bent, stained helmets hung like African masks. Beneath them BRIAN, 7, and STEPHEN, 12, are trying to struggle into a pair of the ludicrously massive coats over their pajamas.}

<ACTION>__{Brian stamps his foot on the siren button. The red light snaps on, the siren growls and blares, and they're off down the street. Brian turns around in his seat and, at the last instant before the corner, makes eye contact with his older brother. They stick their tongues out.}
<LOC>__{EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER}
<ACTION>__{The engine howls its way through the city. Brian, sandwiched between his father and Adcox, looks out in wonderment at intersections zipping past like picket fences, at people on sidewalks holding hands over their ears, at the red emergency lights bouncing crazily off shop windows.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER}

<ACTION>__{Brian smiles to the pumper operator. He just wants a better look. And he gets it: Smoke turned evil and dark now, taking on purpose.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER}
<ACTION>__{There's a level of apartments above the storefronts. As Brian watches, a window opens and out steps his father and Adcox onto a small fire escape. Their attention's on the next window over, out of reach, wrapped in leaky smoke. Suddenly Dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing, armed with only an axe, and JUMPS across to the next metal balcony. A ballsy, dangerous move. He kicks in the window, breaks out the frame with his axe, and dives in. A beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified, smudged little girl. He hands the little girl over the railing to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way -- a ladder. Dennis's face lifts and grins at Brian; dirty, bigger than life, invincible. He winks a wink only possible between fathers and sons and he's gone again, back into the swirling darkness. As Brian stands there, full of love, full of pride, he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack; releasing a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over the roof. The flame seems to pause, to stare at Brian a beat. Shhh, don't tell anyone. Brian is transfixed, his little head staring up in astonishment. Nobody else has noticed it. Brian can see his father and Adcox through the window; probing, looking for the flame lurking just above. Brian starts to call out in a small, hesitant voice,}
<CHAR>__{BRIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Dad...}
<ACTION>__{He tries to call louder... But suddenly everything is happening very fast in slow motion: -- Brian can see Adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole as Brian steps forward, under the power of a flame that beckons him as -- Dennis suddenly THROWS his body against Adcox, knocking him clear just as a flame EXPLODES DOWNWARD from the ceiling fully against him as -- All the building's windows BLOW OUT and it's like the sky's erupted for Brian, a burning hailstorm that falls and pelts the ground around him. Plaster, wood, and something metal that cracks against the pavement and spins slowly. A fire helmet. And Adcox is coming out the door now, blackened and torn, hopeless tears streaming down his face.}
<CHAR>__{AXE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Get us some backup! We need some goddamn backup!}
<ACTION>__{And, spotting Brian, he runs towards him. And the helmet spins and spins and Adcox keeps running, and the sky is raining fire, and the flame on the roof has risen up now to its full, horrifying size and it's laughing now, laughing at the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning, and we read the printing on the neck guard.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{MCCAFFREY}
<ACTION>__{And Adcox is sobbing and has his arms around the boy, protecting him from the fire, the world, but it's like Brian doesn't see him. He pulls away from Adcox, walks up to his father's helmet, And puts it on. The scene EXPLODES with a flash as a photographer captures the instant.}

The fire shakes off the powder, rises up to kill -- Just as Brian spins and HITS it with the STREAM. -- And it's like a howling train wreck as the two grapple with each other -- Pengelly and Nightengale have an opening, and they're dashing for the catwalk ladder up to Stephen because the fire doesn't care -- it only has eyes for Brian now -- -- And Stephen sees Brian tackle the monster, and his eyes fill with tears -- -- And the fire's pushing Brian -- pushing him with the fury of a frightened street bully -- but Brian won't give -- and now the fire's back's broken -- it's whimpering, dying.
