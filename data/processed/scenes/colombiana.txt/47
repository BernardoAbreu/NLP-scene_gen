<L>__{interior bedroom morning}
<A>__{cat looks around the clean, orderly bedroom as she gathers her thoughts. her eyes move around the room. it is a boy's room. with models of soldiers, futuristic warriors, a big poster of al pacino as tony montana in scarface. a poster with every imaginable type of assault rifle.}
<L>__{interior kitchen morning}
<A>__{emilio sits reading the financial section of the morning paper over what seems to be the remains of a very hearty breakfast. an elderly woman, grandmotherly, fills his coffee cup.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{gracias mama.}
<A>__{a noise turns both of them to the doorway and cat.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{good morning.}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{buenos diaz cara. come. sit. i will make you some eggs.}
<A>__{mama caresses her face, her eyes glisten with a grandmother's love. kisses her on the forehead, lovingly, whispers into her ear.}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{you have your mother's beautiful eyes. don't be scared. this is your home.}
<A>__{slowly, hesitantly, cat makes her way across the kitchen to the table, where she sits opposite emilio, tentative.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{when was the last time you slept?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i don't know. a long time ago.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{well good. a growing body needs sleep. when i was your age i would sleep half the day. i don't know if it helped with the growing, but i was well rested for whatever came after.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{whose room is that?}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{my son. your cousin.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{he's dead.}
<A>__{his voice holds anger, not sadness.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{killed?}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{by who?}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{no one who is still alive.}
<A>__{mama comes over, puts a plate of eggs in front of her. as she begins to wolf down the food. he holds up the page of her drawing, the one her father put his address on.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{you are very talented. is this what you want to be? an artist?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i used to want to be like lara. a super agent.}
<A>__{shoveling more food into her mouth.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{not anymore?}
<A>__{chewing, cat shakes her head.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{and now?}
<C>__{cat}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{i want to be a killer.}
<A>__{she keeps shoveling food in her mouth. emilio looks up at his mother, who crosses herself. cat finishes the last mouthful, looks up.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{can you help?}
<A>__{emilio blinks once.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{sure.}
