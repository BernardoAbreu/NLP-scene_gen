<A>__{the cadillac zooms up from below, crosses the intersection, and immediately takes the next down ramp. eddie flies up from below, briefly airborne, barreling after them into the tunnel.}

<A>__{a block later the cadillac heads topside again. eddie takes a gamble and goes straight ahead. at the next down ramp, the cadillac descends and tony's boys find themselves doing 70 knots side by side with eddie in the other lane. in the narrow concrete tunnel, the two cars battle each other like bulls in a chute, each one trying to cut the other off, bouncing from each other into the walls and back again.}
