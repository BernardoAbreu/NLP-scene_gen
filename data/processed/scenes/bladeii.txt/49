<L>__{exterior the city night}
<A>__{a sulfur colored moon shines its baleful light down upon the icy cityscape as nomak's roar echoes through the canyon of buildings.}
<L>__{interior scud's workshop blade's sleeping area night}
<A>__{blade is just finishing injecting himself with serum. he sighs, falling back into the chair he's sitting in, waiting for the shakes to subside. he unwraps a piece of rubbing tubing which he'd been using as a tourniquet, flexes his hand. the door to his room opens. scud stands there in silhouette.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{um, we've got company.}
<L>__{interior scud's workshop night}
<A>__{blade emerges into the workshop proper with whistler and scud.}
<B>__{nyssa and bloodpack}
<A>__{stand before us. they represent an assortment of ages and races, their one unifying characteristic being a callous, almost fanatical disregard for human life. in short, these guys are the most stone cold motherfuckers we've ever seen.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{well if it isn't snow white and the seven suckheads.}
<A>__{their leader, dieter reinhardt (30s), is a square jawed, chiseled austrian. next to reinhardt is snowman, a wire albino, lighthammer, a massive blackfoot indian, and priest, a bald headed modern primitive with copious piercings and facial tattoos. rounding out the bunch is chupa, a blunt featured puerto rican, and verlaine, a familiar looking curvaceous beauty with bee stung lips that exudes a predatory sexuality. (note: verlaine looks familiar because she is the twin sister of raquel, the bodacious vamp played by traci lords that blade killed in the opening scene of the first film.)}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{check it out, troops. count chocula.}
<A>__{the vampires laugh. asad quiets them with a look, then gestures to them in turn.}
<C>__{asad}
<D>__{blade, this is reinhardt. that's snowman, lighthammer, priest, chupa and verlaine.}
<A>__{reinhardt advances until he and blade are nose to nose.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{tell me something, chief. can you blush?}
<A>__{a tense beat. then blade flashes a broad smile.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{alright, you want to play this game?}
<A>__{blade pulls out one of his silver stakes. in response, the vampires reach for their weapons. but blade merely twirls it around his fingers. then tosses it to reinhardt.}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{you've been training two years to take me out. here i am, the big, bad vampire hunter. so do it.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing, blade?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{we're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.}
<P>__{(spreading his hands wide)}
<D>__{so let's get it over with. i will give you a free shot, reinhardt.}
<A>__{reinhardt looks to nyssa, uncomfortable.}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{why are you looking at her for? you need permission? i'm giving it to you.}
<C>__{chupa}
<D>__{take him, cabron!}
<A>__{blade grabs reinhardt's wrist, pulling the stake against his chest, fixing the vampire with the deadliest of poker gazes.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{what's wrong, reinhardt? you need a fucking manual?}
<C>__{verlaine}
<D>__{do it, reinhardt. do it!!!}
<A>__{reinhardt tenses, thrusting the stake forward but blade has already whirled out of the way, trapping his hand, then violently twisting it backwards. before reinhardt even knows what's happening, blade swings him around into a headlock. in his free hand he's got a tiny, barbed flechette. the barbs spring open like a tick's gripping mandibles as blade drives the flechette into the base of reinhardt's skull. reinhardt howls in pain, but blade just tightens his grip, choking off reinhardt's air.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{listen up, adolph, i just popped an explosive charge in the back of your head. silver nitrate. rigged to blow if anyone tampers with it. i will be keeping the detonator on me at all times. you so much as look at me crosswise and i swear you'll be macking your girlfriend's pie with a fucking neck stump! got it?!}
<A>__{reinhardt lets loose a choked grunt. blade releases him, dropping the gasping austrian to the floor.}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{any questions?}
<A>__{no one says a word.}
