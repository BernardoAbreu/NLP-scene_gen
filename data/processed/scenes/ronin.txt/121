<T>__{up to reveal:}
<A>__{the periferique the massive and confusing highway system which encircles the city of paris. right away we notice that this entrance ramp leads to a traffic circle, filled with various off ramps which lead to no less than four different sections of the periferique. in the peugeot }
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(slamming the dashboard in disgust)}
<D>__{you slept with her!}
<A>__{in the compact }
<C>__{seamus}
<P>__{(lecturing deridre)}
<D>__{you should have kill him when you had the chance. but no...}
<A>__{in the peugeot }
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you put everything on the line because you...}
<B>__{in the compact}
<C>__{seamus}
<P>__{(as if finishing vincent's sentence)}
<D>__{you slept with the fucker!!}
<A>__{on the periferique the peugeot cruising on an upper part of the traffic circle, while down below them the compact turns towards one of the roadways.}
<C>__{vincent }
<D>__{fuck...}
<A>__{in the peugeot }
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{left left left!!!}
<A>__{sam looks up and sees three possible ramps: one to the right, one to the center, and one to the left. at the last second he takes the left turn as we go back to in the compact car where seamus has turned from lecturing deirdre to threatening gregor. seamus holds the package in one hand and his gun in the other.}
<C>__{seamus}
<P>__{(waving the package)}
<D>__{this better be the real thing or you're a dead man!}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{it is, i'm telling you it is!!}
<C>__{seamus}
<D>__{you've told me a lot of things, boyo...}
<A>__{zing shatter! a bullet blows a hole in their back windshield as the peugeot is catching up, and vincent is leaning out of his window, firing away. now seamus turns to deirdre.}
<C>__{seamus}
<D>__{lose them!}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{you lose them!}
<A>__{deirdre swings the wheel wildly, and the compact takes a screaming turn, followed by the peugeot, and now they're both speeding towards another junction, where several other roadways of the periferique run together. now we see that seamus is returning vincent's fire, even as the junction approaches, and now seamus screams at deirdre.}
<C>__{seamus}
<D>__{to the right!!!}
<A>__{deirdre swerves to the right only to discover that she's now on an exit ramp, going against heavy traffic. now deirdre swerves her car around, side swiping several cars, but avoiding a major crash while the peugeot follows along, and now one of the cars that deirdre side swiped careens wildly down the ramp, crashing into the peugeot, which grinds to a halt as vincent and sam bounce forward in their seats, restrained by their seatbelts. the car has stalled, and sam has to start her up again and slam it into gear before following after the compact, which now has a lead of perhaps fifty yards but at least it's possible for the peugeot to follow after the compact, because it's the only car on the highway ahead of them that's going the wrong way, and now we pull back, looking down from above, and the two cars are flying through the rush hour traffic, going the wrong way, and now the peugeot is gaining ground as sam turns to vincent.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{give me a cigarette.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{right now?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(fumbling with a cigarette)}
<D>__{why are you driving?}
<P>__{(rapid fire)}
<D>__{you're not french, you don't live here, you don't know these roads. why are you driving?}
<A>__{he puts the cigarette in sam's mouth and as he does the peugeot weaves in and out of the traffic, gaining ground on the compact, and now screeeeecchhh!!!! about fifteen cars pile up, crashing into one another, and yet somehow the compact car emerges from the pile up unscathed, and seamus breathes a hugh sigh of relief.}
<C>__{seamus}
<D>__{about time!}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(glancing in her mirror)}
<D>__{not yet...}
<A>__{the peugeot has also managed to avoid the pile up, and it's back on their tail.}
<C>__{seamus}
<P>__{(practically tearing his hair)}
<D>__{good christ! can't you lose these jokers?}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(through clenched teeth)}
<D>__{they're good!}
<A>__{and now the peugeot slams into the side of the compact car, and as it does seamus opens fire with his gun, even as vincent unloads the better part of a clip as glass shatters in both cars, and now deirdre looks up to see a fork in the road, and the left side of the fork is closed off, blocked by a serious concrete barricade, and the compact car is headed right for it, and now sam has the peugeot pinned right to the side of the compact car, metal against metal, a scream of steel as the barricade rushes straight at them and at the last second deirdre slams on the brakes as seamus fires one last shot that blows out the window in front of sam's eyes, causing sam to jerk the wheel of the peugeot wildly, spinning out of control onto the exit ramp as gregor reaches over and unbuckles seamus's seatbelt right as the compact car slams into the barricade and crashes, and we're in slow motion as deirdre is driven forward by the force of the impact, but there's a driver's side air bag, and it explodes, cushioning her, even as seamus is hurled form the car, crashing through the windshield and flying through the air as the compact car flips over and over and over while gregor, who is wearing his seatbelt, hangs on for dear life to the briefcase, which he grabbed back from seamus before the crash, and now seamus hits the ground with a terrible thud, his face sliced to ribbons by the windshield, but somehow still alive as sam tries to control the peugeot, which is in a spin on the exit ramp as gregor kicks open the back door and slides out of the car, carrying the briefcase with him, as deirdre struggles to free herself from the wreck, which is now on fire, and now sam has managed to stop the peugeot, but it's too late to go back, because a veritable fleet of cop cars is now closing on the accident, and it's too late to turn around, and even as deirdre manages to pull herself out of the wreck, it explodes into a ball of fire, and the blast wave of fire hits seamus, knocking him down, covering him for a second, even as deirdre hurls herself through the flames and comes out rolling away with seamus, who is now not only cut to pieces, but his face is covered with some hideous burns. now deirdre pulls seamus over the side of the embankment, right before the cops arrive, and the two of them roll fall almost thirty down a steep incline, even as sam catches a quick glimpse of gregor, scurrying away from the highway, carrying the briefcase, and now sam has to gun his car and get gone, because the cops have reached the wreck, which is quickly burning itself out, and as the cops look into the debris they see that there's nobody left. everybody's gone.}
