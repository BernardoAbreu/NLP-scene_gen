<L>__{interior shack. night.}
<A>__{in a shack, arvind is singing one of surdas' bhajans in front of maman and an old man who by his ragged appearance must be a villager. punnoose and salim sit behind arvind.}
<C>__{maman}
<D>__{very good, very good. i am pleased, arvind. he is ready.}
<C>__{arvind}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{maman nods to punnoose. before arvind can turn round, punnoose has covered his mouth with a cloth and after the briefest of struggles, arvind's body goes limp. the villager puts an old tin box on the table. taking the lid from the tin, he brings out a cloth and unwraps it. inside is a spoon. he checks the edge with his thumb. sharp. douses it with a clear liquid from a bottle and passes it over a candle flame. the spoon whooshes with a high flame for a moment. the villager wipes it with the cloth nods to punnoose.}
<C>__{punnoose}
<D>__{salim!}
<A>__{utterly bemused, salim nevertheless helps punnoose lay arvind on the table. the villager takes hold of arvind's eyelid and pulls it open. he brings the spoon close. suddenly, salim is being sick in the corner of the shack. by the time he has turned back, the villager is wiping the spoon on a blood soaked rag.}

<C>__{maman }
<D>__{the time has come to choose, yaar. the life of a slum dog or the life of a man. a real man. a gunfighter, salim.}
<A>__{maman holds salim's head in his hands.}
