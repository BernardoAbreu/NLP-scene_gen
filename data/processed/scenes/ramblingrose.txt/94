<L>__{interior hillyer home buddy's bedroom night}
<A>__{a shot of buddy at night in his small bedroom. he wears a rather skimpy old fashioned nightshirt that comes midway between his hips and knees. at the moment he is finishing brushing his teeth at the bureau, using an old fashioned water pitcher and bowl. the camera follows as he walks across the room in the light of the lamp by his bed. he looks around cautiously, then picks up the mattress of his bed. he pushes it far back and we see springs. he takes out a small "book" or pamphlet and stares gravely at it. close up: the front cover of the pamphlet. we see the overall title: little dirty comic books. and beneath it: blondie and dagwood. and beneath that, in smaller letters: "mr. dithers comes to dinner and how!" we see buddy's hands in the shot, and he opens the pamphlet and we catch enough of a glimpse of the thing to know it is pretty awful a drawing maybe of "blondie" stark naked with a finger in her mouth going, "tee hee!" on buddy, as he stares down with grave intentness at the little dirty comic book. slyly now, he retraces his steps to the bureau and takes out a flashlight. he goes back to the bed, switches off the lamp, gets in the bed and turns on the flashlight and pulls the covers over his head. we hear a faint sound on the track and buddy suddenly yanks back the covers, puts the flashlight on the table by the bed and throws the little dirty comic book under the bed. he lies on pillow and pretends he's asleep, and we hear the door of his room open and a creaking on the floor. another angle, on a weepy rose in a very thin nightgown. the shot is from below as buddy might see her as she stands over his bed. she looks very lonely and unhappy and is half crying.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{buddy... are you asleep?}
<A>__{another angle, on both of them. buddy stares at her in surprise. it is dim in the room, but we can see them in the moonlight.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{no, i'm awake. what's the matter?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{buddy, i am wandering in a wilderness, lost.}
<P>__{(sits glumly on edge of bed)}
<D>__{i just feel awful. do you mind if i get in bed with you for a little while?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{well, all right.}
<A>__{another angle, on rose and buddy in the bed in the moonlight. it is all innocent enough, buddy is a child and rose obviously has no lewd intent in getting into his bed. she lies back on a pillow staring up at the ceiling and smoking a cigarette.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i thought i'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. as a child, i never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. buddy... i have got a confession to make.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{what is it, rose?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{it's so terrible i can't tell you. oh, buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and i've had a broken heart so many times. men, i don't understand them, i can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. i can't find mr. right, buddy, i can't find him no matter how hard i look, all i find is a whole pile of mr. wrongs. but this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. it was my fault, oh yes, my fault, i was bad oh god, i was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad i was.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(a little smile)}
<D>__{what'd you do, rose?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{buddy, i was horrible. i can't tell you who it was, but do you know what i did? i sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. why, i let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and i let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...}
<P>__{(pauses, realizes this isn't too dignified)}
<D>__{but to get back serious to what i was sayin', it is not only, buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{you were pretty bad, huh?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{why, it has just made me ill, buddy. i'm sick. i don't want to eat nothin', i don't, and me i got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. i'm ill.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(slyly, pretends he doesn't know)}
<D>__{but, rose, what is the cause of it all?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{promise not to tell doll? or nobody? buddy, it's your daddy! i'm so much in love with him i am out of my mind!}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{but, rose, how could such a thing as that happen?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i fell madly in love with him when he called me rosebud. you know that first day when i come and he said i looked graceful like a capital letter s and called me rosebud? i fell madly in love with that man right then.}
<P>__{(sighs tragically)}
<D>__{but it's a lost love, buddy. he's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me.}
<A>__{another angle, on rose and buddy in the bed. buddy has propped on an elbow and is staring down at her breasts in the moonlight we see the soft notch between her breasts in the open v of her thin nightgown. she is completely unself conscious with him.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{can i touch you here?}
<A>__{before she can answer, he touches her breast with his finger through her nightgown.}
<C>__{buddy }
<D>__{hmmm, it's soft. it's awful soft.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(casually, doesn't object)}
<D>__{what did you expect?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{well, i thought they were more like a cantaloupe.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(touches her breast more}
<D>__{boldly, his hand outside}
<P>__{the nightgown)}
<D>__{there's some kind of gristle in it, though.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{actually, i am, though.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(dreamily, thinking of}
<D>__{daddy as she smokes cigarette and stares up}
<P>__{at the ceiling)}
<D>__{you know, that daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth nexterior}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{can i put my hand inside your nightgown, rose?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{no, you can't. and i will tell you this he scares me. as kind as he is, he scares me. you can't fool around with him, not with that man. and, boy, i sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{rose, can't i see what the nipple on it is like?}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(frowns)}
<D>__{buddy, what's come over you? a child like you, askin' such things.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{but i'm curious, rose.}
<A>__{puts his hand in her nightgown.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{buddy, get your hand offa me! quit it, get you hand away...}
<A>__{takes his wrist.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{just for a second. please, rose, what's the harm?}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{aw, come on, rose, i want to see what the nipple on it is like.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{you don' t need to know that. it's none of your business.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{aw, be a good sport, rose.}
<P>__{(sweetly, almost sugarily)}
<D>__{you like me, don't you? i like you a lot.}
