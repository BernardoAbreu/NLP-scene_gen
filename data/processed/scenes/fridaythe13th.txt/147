<A>__{jack rolls to his side, picks up a small hand rolled cigarette and lights it. he inhales deeply, rolls on his back. something overhead catches his eye. across the way from the row of toilet stalls is a row of shower stalls, and further down is a row of several sinks and mirrors. we hear the toilet flush. we cut inside : the toilet booth as marcie stands reading the graffiti to herself. we can only see her from the chest up.}
