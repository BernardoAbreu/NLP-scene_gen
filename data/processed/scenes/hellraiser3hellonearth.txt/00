<L>__{exterior derelict street twilight}
<A>__{night is falling in a forgotten part of the city. the street lights are a joke three out of four are dead. only a large moon and some cloud streaked stars illuminate this dark and derelict street. once the hub of an industrial area, now the buildings are abandoned, the sidewalks choked with litter and debris. stores are boarded up, windows are glassless, walls are graffitied. at various points, several bums warm their hands at trash can fires.}
<B>__{angle on two bums}
<A>__{ as their eyes move, following something moving down the street. heard off is the sound of a smooth and powerful engine.}
<B>__{angle on street}
<A>__{down this boulevard of decay and despair drives an incongruously expensive car a range rover. a rich kid is going shopping. the car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only open store on the block.}
<B>__{angle on store}
<A>__{a dim light bulb shines within the only indicator that the store is still trading. its windows are grimy, its door defaced. above the door barely legible through the accrued dirt of city years a sign; carducci's antiques and curios.}
<B>__{angle on car}
<A>__{the side door opens helped on its way by the kick of an expensive leather boot and jp monroe steps out. jp is 24, rich, handsome, and spoiled. his hair is slick with designer grease, his slim frame is wrapped in a $600 leather jacket. for a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous glances up and down the ruined street. he shows no anxiety at being in this twilight part of town. cocooned in the confidence of wealth, he's never felt threatened in his life. satisfied he's in the right place, he walks confidently through the doorway.}
