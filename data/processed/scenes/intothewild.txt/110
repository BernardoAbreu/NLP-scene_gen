<A>__{chris stands beside the family piano, speaking to a party of his parent's friends, walt and billie among them. beside him, a large gift wrapped present. carine sits at the foot of the stairs at the back of the room watching her brother with a hint of concern.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(a little drunk, a little emotional)}
<D>__{dad, you and i have had our differences over the years...but on your birthday i want to tell you how grateful i am for all the things you've given me. and that you did it starting from nothing to working your way through college and busting your ass to support us kids. so, in return, i've been busting my ass a bit...at domino's pizza }
<A>__{chris moves to the gift.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{and i've gotten you this token, this damned expensive token, as a token of that appreciation.}
<A>__{chris holds the large gift toward walt. walt moves through his friends to chris and strips the paper, exposing a beautiful questar telescope.}
<C>__{walt}
<P>__{(patting his son the back)}
<D>__{would you look at that.}
<A>__{walt holds the telescope up for all to see. and the party responds with applause. chris walks through the cheering family friends to take his place beside carine at the bottom of the steps.}
<C>__{carine}
<D>__{jesus, you must've had a lot to drink.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{too much and not enough. i used to believe all that stuff. that whole story. i thought maybe if i said it again, i'd believe it. but i don't.}
<A>__{tears have come to chris' eyes. he puts his head in his hands. carine puts an arm around him.}
