<C>__{commander anderson}
<D>__{you men following the general: you are united states marines and under oath you forgotten that? we all have shipmates we remember some of 'em were shit on and spit on by the pentagon that doesn't give you the right to mutiny.}

<A>__{on the mezzanine pvt. coxis boot nudges a tile which has come loose from its mortar. the tile inches to the edge of the mezzanine. then it falls ...... boyer, reacting to the falling tile, brings up his machine gun and fires a sustained burst in its direction and all hell breaks loose. the marines fire in unison. a cruel withering fusillade. the s.e.a.l.s in the middle of the floor take the brunt of it. they gamely return fire. but they're hit. again. again. again. in the drainage hole goodspeed, mason, and lt. shepherd listen (and watch, when the view allows) in utter horror to the firefight above. lt. shepherd scrambles up the ladder. goodspeed grabs him. tries to pull him down.}

<D>__{let go of me.}
<A>__{lt. shepherd climbs the ladder. in the shower room anderson takes a bullet in his leg. his automatic blazing, he takes a bullet in the forearm. the chest. the shoulder. three marines on the mezzanine are hit and killed. lt. shepherd climbs out of the drainage pipe and comes up firing. he instantly takes a bullet through the visor, killing him instantly. shepherd falls to his knees and pitches over, falling face first into the drainage hole, where shepherd's lifeless eyes come face to face with goodspeed, who nearly passes out, then looks away in horror. s.e.a.l.s behind the columns return fire. they're hit, picked off.one by one. marine cox and mccoy fire a 50 cal. gun (as powerful as anti aircraft or anti tank round) through the column, killing reigert and boyer.}
