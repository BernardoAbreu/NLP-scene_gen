<A>__{sam and garang walking through the middle of camp, trailed by a squad of spla bodyguards and camp children...}
<C>__{garang}
<D>__{they call you preacher. is this what i should call you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sam is fine.}
<C>__{garang}
<D>__{i hear what you have done for the spla and i am grateful.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we can thank god for his blessins.}
<C>__{garang}
<D>__{yes, we can. how many children do you look after, sam?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{couple hundred with us here. feed another thousand a day from nearby villages. anyone who shows up hungry gets a meal.}
<A>__{and they continue through the camp. a few of the children running up to garang, touching the cuff of his shirt, then sprinting away...}
<C>__{garang}
<D>__{what you are doing is noble, but too dangerous. i must advise you to stop risking your life in our struggle.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{until someone starts fightin for these children, i'm the one that's gonna do it.}
<C>__{garang}
<D>__{you are stubborn, aren't you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{as a mule.}
<A>__{garang smiling, an instant affinity for this man.}
<C>__{garang}
<D>__{you and i come from very different worlds, but we are not so dissimilar.}
<A>__{and another child runs up to garang, touching him, and then sprints away giggling...}
<C>__{garang }
<D>__{i founded the spla in order to fight for the future of sudan because nobody else would. we fight for freedom from the government in khartoum, for the right to vote, and for the right to worship any god one may choose.}
<A>__{more children running up... garang touching their heads...}
<C>__{garang }
<D>__{but most important to me is our struggle for the children. their laughter has been lost to this country for far too long.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there are peace talks scheduled for the end of august in naivashu. i'd like you to come as my guest.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{talkin bout peace in a room somewhere is a waste of time. you gotta go out and make it.}
<C>__{garang}
<D>__{you are correct, but we must fight them at every level. part of my battle is waged in those rooms. we must talk of peace, but keep our rifles ready for war.}
<A>__{sam turning to him, coming to an understanding here. realizing that both of them are warriors in the same fight.}
<C>__{garang }
<D>__{maybe together you and i can make sudan free once again.}
<A>__{and now we see they have arrived at the brick chapel in the middle of the compound. garang turning to him, eyes suddenly becoming dark...}
<C>__{garang }
<D>__{there is a cost for freedom, sam. a price for the future of these people. some pay with their lives, others pay in different ways.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{my only hope is that your cost is not too great.}
<A>__{and suddenly we're someplace far away... another world... the}
