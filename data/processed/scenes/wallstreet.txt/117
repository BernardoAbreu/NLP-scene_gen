<L>__{interior condo night}
<A>__{the look of the place is evocative of ancient times, yet sumptuous. darien and bud sink into the bales of down in the sofa and are dwarfed. she rests her head on a hand stencilled velvet venetian throw pillow, looking like a pre raphaelite madonna. a terracotta pot with a spray of white phaleonopsis graces the coffee table. as the sun sets over the canyons of highrises, bud walks around his new home totally in awe. this apartment, perfect in its restrained taste with all the "correct" flowers and objects, has nothing to do with him. perhaps he can understand the state of the art kitchen, the computerized telephone, stereo and light system, but he needs a set of instructions just to be able to switch on david letterman. this apartment is darien's fantasy, and bud is merely the incidental client who paid for it. most importantly to her, it is ready to be photographed by house and garden.}

<P>__{(dubiously looking at}
<D>__{a rough plaster wall}
<P>__{of fading fresco)}
<D>__{you know, the elevator man couldn't believe i paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in brooklyn.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{i will bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. this apartment is already ahead of its time. i call it the "demolished" look. they've already heard about it at house and garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. is that alright? i'd love to have it in my portfolio.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{sure... but your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.}
<A>__{as he nuzzles her neck, she feels threatened, stops.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{let's get things straight, bud. i'm not going to take a cut. i worked hard and you can't decorate a room in new york for less than $100,000. curtains alone...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i'm kidding, i'm kidding, we're still young, darien. so what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. after all, this is not the house in connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, yuppie and fruppie into the lycee francaise.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{you got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{that's right one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...}
<A>__{as the kiss grows, his hands move into her nether regions. she looks at him, sober.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{do you think you're ready?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{it's not me i'm worried about...you know darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will and not knowing when was the only surprise left. you owe me, i want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.}
<P>__{(he folds back her palms in his)}
<D>__{...right here...make love to me...now...}
<P>__{(more kissing)}
<D>__{stop me if i'm going too far.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{i will let you know.}
