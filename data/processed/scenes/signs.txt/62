<L>__{interior pharmacy afternoon}
<A>__{graham waits at a white counter. a gum chewing pharmacist in her early twenties, who looks like she's in her teens, glances through back shelves of medicines as she listens to the radio.}
<C>__{radio host }
<D>__{why is no one saying the obvious? this is just a rash case of copycats. someone, somewhere, does the first one. it's on tv, it's on the internet. in less than an hour a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea and here we are... on the verge of mass hysteria.}

<D>__{it was asthma medicine right father?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{for morgan hess. and it's not father anymore.}
<A>__{the pharmacist looks back at graham and then reaches up and turns off the radio. she quietly finds the prescription on the shelf and moves to the counter across from graham. she doesn't ring it up. she just stands there fiddling with the bag holding morgan's medicine. beat.}
<C>__{pharmacist}
<D>__{can i ask you a favor father?}
<A>__{graham stares at the girl. beat. he nods "yes."}
<C>__{pharmacist}
