<A>__{angela's apartment is plunged in total darkness ben lays anna esseker's file on the coffee table and aims the desk lamp at his "research corner" on the wall. he turns the lamp back at the file and sits down to study it. why are the mirrors asking for anna if she's already dead? why? it doesn't make any sense... on an index card filled in by anna's parents in september 1952, ben finds a pennsylvania home address. dr. kane's first diagnosis is irrevocable "despite her young age, anna esseker suffers from severe schizophrenia, leading to withdrawal from reality, delusional and violent behavior." he shuffles through the first few pages of various administrative documents. his eye lands on several photographs of anna taken at the time she was admitted to the hospital she is just a child, yet, six male nurses were needed to restrain and immobilize her in front of the photographer. her face is hardly discernible as she struggles like a wild animal. a high pitched sound of cracking glass is heard from behind. ben turns around another loud crack it comes from one of the covered mirrors in the apartment. ben rises slowly to his feet and comes closer. he removes the sheet hanging on the frame a crack has appeared in the upper corner of the mirror. ben casts his eyes over the reflection. his glance comes to rest on anna's file laying on the desk he goes to fetch the photograph of the little girl and presents it to the mirror kraaaaack the crack in the mirror spreads, as if some kind of pressure were applied on the other side of the mirror as a reaction to the photograph...}
