<L>__{interior crypt}
<A>__{indy's flashlight beam dances across the glass coffin tops. decayed corpses smile from inside, their hands tightly clutching crucifixes. bottomley is horrified by the sights. indiana continues ahead. he passes the burning candle, moving further into the darkness of the crypt. the shivering bottomley stays directly behind indy. with their every step, the bell's ringing grows louder... louder... indiana and bottomley arrive in a circular chamber, located at the far end of the crypt. here, the ringing bell is nearly deafening. the sound echoes from above. we are on the floor of the bell tower. indiana shines his flashlight upward. the beam stops on a ringing bell that hangs several feet in the air. inside of the bell, dangling by his feet, is the dead body of hennesey! he has replaced the bell clapper! his body swings back and forth. it slams into the sides of the bell. causing the dull ringing. bottomley screams. indiana grabs bottomley's arm.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{let's get outta' here.}
<A>__{indy and bottomley turn to the crypt door. it begins to close! the two men dash forward. the door continues to close. indy and bottomley are only inches away...when the door slams shut! they push and kick at the door. no good. it won't budge. a panicked bottomley calls for help.}
<C>__{bottomley}
<D>__{inspector macgowan! galbraith! open the door!}
<A>__{using his flashlight, indy scans the door, looking for a crack, another way out. indy nudges bottomley.}

<P>__{(motioning to candle)}
<D>__{i need more light.}
<A>__{bottomley hurries to the candle. he reaches out. there is a loud whoosh! the candle flame goes out! followed by total darkness! indy turns from the door.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{bottomley?...}
<A>__{no answer. indy shines his flashlight toward the area. the candle is gone. there is no sign of bottomley. indiana takes a step forward.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{bottomley?...}
<A>__{again, no answer. indy sweeps the flashlight beam across the room. it passes one of the coffins...then shoots back! indy is met with a shocking sight! bottomley lies inside the coffin! dead! his face twisted in a ghoulish smile. all of his bones broken. his hands are wrapped around a crucifix. indy stares in horror. there is a sound. footsteps. there is someone else in here. indy's flashlight beam darts around the crypt. there is no sign of anyone.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{who is it?... who's there?...}
<A>__{the same crazed laugh of a man echoes through the crypt. a chilled indy turns back to the door. he is startled to find the crypt door covered with a thick sheet of ice! indy reaches out. he touches the sparkling, green ice. he snaps back his hand. his fingers are burnt.}
