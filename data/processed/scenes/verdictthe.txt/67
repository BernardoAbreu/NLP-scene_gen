<C>__{dr. thompson}
<D>__{i have been practicing medicine for forty six years and i know when an injustice has been done.}
<C>__{concannon}

<P>__{(in undertone, to bailiff)}
<D>__{do we have time this morning to...}
<P>__{(glances at watch, bailiff nods to him)}
<D>__{all right. mr. galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with dr. thompson this afternoon.}
<C>__{galvin}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{thank you, your honor, i will continue. dr. thompson. did you examine deborah ann kaye last night at the northern chronic care facility?}
<C>__{dr. thompson}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{concannon}
<D>__{objection.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{sustained. yes. the witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{judge}
<P>__{(patronizing)}
<D>__{i believe that's the law... is it not, mr. galvin...?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{dr. thompson. from your review of the hospital records of may twelfth nineteen seventy six.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{in your opinion, what happened to deborah ann kaye?}
<C>__{dr. thompson}
<D>__{cardiac arrest. during delivery her heart stopped. when the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. you get brain damage. that is why she's in the state she's in today.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{now, dr. towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. in your opinion is his estimate correct?}
<C>__{dr. thompson}
<D>__{it's my opinion it took him much longer. nine... ten minutes. there's too much brain damage.}
<A>__{the judge leans over.}
<C>__{judge}
<P>__{(to dr. thompson)}
<D>__{are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?}
<C>__{dr. thompson}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{your honor!}
<A>__{he has shouted unconsciously; the whole courtroom turns to look at him.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{yes, mr. galvin?}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{if i may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i'd just like to get to the point, mr. galvin. let's not waste these people's time. answer the question, mr. witness. please. would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?}
<C>__{dr. thompson}
<D>__{i... in that small context i would have... i would have to say 'no.'}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?}
<C>__{dr. thompson}
<D>__{i... given the limits of your question, that's correct.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{the doctors were not negligent.}
<C>__{dr. thompson}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i... um...}
<A>__{the judge shrugs, meaning, "well then what in the hell are we doing here?"}

<C>__{judge}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{the witness starts to step down. galvin strides over to him and speaks to the judge.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{i'm not through with the witness, your honor. with all due respect if you are going to try my case for me i would appreciate it if you wouldn't lose it.}
<A>__{the judge stands, furious.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{thank you. i think that's enough for this morning. i will see the plaintiff's counsel in my chambers. now, please.}
<A>__{the courtroom rises. the bailiff is heard, "all rise, court is adjourned until one o'clock."}
