<L>__{exterior platform oil derrick moments later}
<A>__{finn approaches a loading bay from above, hides. he watches as gremlins, pacers and assorted other cars scurry about.}
<C>__{finn }
<D>__{leland turbo, this is finn mcmissile. i'm at the rally pointerior over.}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{finn }
<D>__{leland, it's finn. please respond. over.}
<A>__{an access door opens loudly below. a boxy, monacle wearing german car enters. this is professor otto zundapp.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<P>__{(in german and english)}
<D>__{too many cars here. out of my way!}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{professor zundapp?}
<C>__{pacer }
<D>__{here it is, professor.}
<A>__{zundapp approaches a nosy pacer who idles next to a crate.}
<C>__{nosy pacer}
<D>__{you wanted to see this before we load it?}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{ah, yes. very carefully...}
<A>__{a forklift opens the crate inside is a tv camera, packed carefully in foam. finn snaps photos furiously.}
<C>__{nosy pacer}
<D>__{oh. a tv camera. what does it actually do?}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{this camera is extremely dangerous.}
<C>__{finn}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{what are you up to now, professor?}
<A>__{finn, angling for a better view, fires suspension wires which sail clear to the other side of the derrick thok! they hook tightly onto a steel girder. finn slides out onto the wire like an acrobat, then expels another cross wire for support.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{this is valuable equipment. make sure it is properly secured for the voyage.}
<C>__{nosy pacer}
<D>__{you got it.}
<A>__{finn lowers himself. he snaps more pictures.}
<C>__{grem }
<D>__{hey, professor z!}
<A>__{zundapp turns as a crane lowers a car sized crate. grem and acer, an orange gremlin and a green pacer, flank it.}
<C>__{grem}
<D>__{this is one of those british spies we told you about.}
<C>__{acer}
<D>__{yeah. this one we caught sticking his bumper where it didn't belong.}
<A>__{finn produces semi automatic guns from his side, readies himself for a tag team spy fight with his buddy leland.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{agent leland turbo.}
<A>__{the crate is lifted, revealing a crushed, cubed leland turbo. finn's eyes go wide. suddenly whoooshhh! another derrick flame rises behind him, casts a finn shaped shadow over the professor. he looks up.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{it's finn mcmissile! he's seen the camera! kill him!!}
<A>__{finn unloads with bullets as he starts to retreat he stops: bad guy cars are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just came from blowtorches ready. finn, stuck in midair, notices an angry crane. finn grins, having just found his escape. thwapthwapthwap!!! finn releases three of his four cables, swinging, indiana jones style on the last one toward the crane where he lands on its boom, drives up and launches off it where he lands moving onto another deck! finn now drives, spraying oil and screeching around corners. a gremlin in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control and plummets off the side of the rig! the gremlin falls... it's like an eternity... he smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces. on finn now set upon by 20 or 30 more pursuing cars. he has nowhere to go but up up up a ramp toward the helipad. he spies some gasoline barrels, fires a single bullet which cuts through its leather straps, sending barrels down the ramp, past finn past the pursuing cars to the bottom where they explode in a chain reaction back up the ramp, taking out at least 15 cars! on the helipad finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. no more road. nowhere else to go. the 20 bad guy cars that are still in pursuit surround him, fire up their blowtorches. about to pounce. finn grins. the second time we've seen this grin. it means he's got something cooking. finn's reverse lights appear. he drives backward off the edge of the helipad to the shock of the other cars. finn falls. he turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly cutting into the water. he emerges, now sprouting hydrofoil and speeds away.}
<C>__{grem}
<P>__{(nonplussed)}
<D>__{get to the boats.}
<A>__{the boats an army of combat ships quickly drop into the sea and churn water with unprecedented fury as they quickly make up the distance between them and finn, firing bullets as they do so.}
<C>__{acer}
<D>__{he's getting away!}
<C>__{combat ship}
<D>__{not for long.}
<A>__{the lead combat ship quietly drops a torpedo into the water. it skips along, connecting with finn in his rear and exploding with such force that water skyrockets into the night clouds. underwater mcmissile sinks. then, he blinks. he grins. we're starting to like this grin and what follows it. he now converts into a submarine. from his trunk he releases four decoy tires which float to the surface like body parts. on the derrick professor zundapp watches it all from far away.}
<C>__{grem }
<D>__{he's dead, professor.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{wunderbar. with finn mcmissile gone, who can stop us now?}
