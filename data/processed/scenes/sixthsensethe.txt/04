<A>__{anna giggles some more as malcolm's shadow stumbles across the bedroom.}
<B>__{malcolm turns on the bathroom light.}
<A>__{a shaft of light falls on anna as she stands in the corner of the room. anna smiles playfully and pulls off her sweater. she sways to a pretend striptease song. malcolm can't hold back his grin. he joins in slowly peeling off the sweat shirt. he looks back to anna. she's stopped her playful dance. she's facing away from him. he walks towards her. his grin quietly disappears. malcolm's face turns to rock as his attention is drawn to the shattered window in their bedroom. the wind moves through the room. a lamp lays broken on the ground by the window. malcolm kneels down. beat. anna's eyes fill with a quiet awareness.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{he's still in the house.}
<B>__{a shadow from the bathroom flats over both of them. anna screams.}
<A>__{malcolm spins around. his heart stops. malcolm and anna stare at the bathroom doorwary. they know someone is inside. beat. malcolm slowly starts towards the door. the first thing that comes into view are the clothes on the bathroom floor. then the figure of a man comes into view. a stranger stands bare chested in the back of the bathroom.}
<B>__{no one makes a sound.}
<A>__{the stranger is about nineteen. drugged out. pitch black eyes bulging. his body is covered in scars and bruises. his hands are folded in front of him. he shakes ever so slightly. he has a patch of white in his hair. malcolm speaks in a very calm voice. never takes his eyes off the stranger.}

<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{there are no needles or prescription drugs of any kind in this house.}
