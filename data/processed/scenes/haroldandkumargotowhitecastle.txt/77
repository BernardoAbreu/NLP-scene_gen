<L>__{interior emergency room}
<A>__{the scene is very fast paced, with several young medical technicians rushing around. harold is confused and concerned as the nurse leads he and kumar over towards a patient...}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(whispering to kumar)}
<D>__{what the hell's going on here?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{he must think i'm saikat. don't worry. leave the talking up to me.}
<A>__{on the operating table is a patient bleeding from his chest. he is conscious and appears to be in a lot of pain.}
<C>__{male nurse}
<D>__{the patient was brought in by ems five minutes ago. he has three gunshot wounds with entry in the anterior abdomen. no exit wounds.}
<A>__{harold sees blood squirt out of the patient's chest.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{oh shit! this guy's gonna die!!!}
<B>__{the patient hears this and looks nervously at harold.}
<C>__{male nurse}
<D>__{it's a good thing i found you two. all the other surgeons are working on other patients...}
<A>__{the nurse hands harold a surgical instrument.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{wait. hold on. you see you got this all wrong. we're not doc...}
<A>__{kumar interrupts before harold can tell her the truth.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{what dr. lee is trying to say is that we need to sedate the patient first or else he could go into cardiac arrest.}
<A>__{harold looks at kumar confused and nervous.}
<C>__{male nurse}
<D>__{alright. i will get the anesthesiologist.}
<A>__{the nurse is about to rush away, but kumar stops him.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{hold on. what we should probably use is marijuana. that'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery.}
<C>__{male nurse}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{marijuana? but why...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{we don't have time for questions! we need marijuana now! get as much of it as possible! like a big bag of it!}
<A>__{kumar shows the amount he wants with his hands.}
<C>__{male nurse}
<D>__{but doctor, we don't have marijuana in this hospital.}
<A>__{harold gives kumar a dirty look.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{suddenly, more blood squirts from the patient's chest. harold shouts in disgust, making the patient more nervous...}
<C>__{male nurse}
<D>__{we're losing him! you gotta do something!}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{very well. i guess we'll have to do this the old fashioned way.}
<A>__{kumar puts a nitrous oxide mask over the patient's face. harold gives kumar a look "what the fuck are you doing?"}
<C>__{kumar }
<D>__{first, we need to clear his c spine. i want stat x rays of the chest and abdomen. give me two large bore ivs and start a ringers lactate push. nurse, we need 2 units of o neg on board.}
<A>__{using the surgical equipment, kumar actually begins removing bullets from the bleeding patient!!! harold can't believe what's going on. suddenly, the patient begins having trouble breathing! he's gasping for air! the beeping sound monitoring his heart rate begins speeding up to an insane pace.}
<C>__{male nurse}
<D>__{doctor! the patient is desatting!}
<A>__{kumar quickly examines the patient's chest...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{ah, i see. the patient's got a collapsed lung. get me a 14 gage angiocath, stat!}
<A>__{after a couple seconds go by...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{what's taking so long?}
<A>__{the nurse hands kumar what is essentially a large needle! kumar directs the needle in the direction of the patient's chest. it's a tense moment. the patient is scared. so is harold. the nurse looks hopeful. kumar looks determined. with a quick thrust, kumar jabs the needle into the patient's chest, causing a rush of air! the patient breathes easier. his heart rate drops back to normal.}
<C>__{male nurse}
<D>__{great catch doctor! his sat is up to 94!}
<A>__{kumar is cool and collected. he turns to the young medical technicians who have been aiding the surgery.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(casual)}
<D>__{will one of you guys put the chest tube in and wrap this up?}
<A>__{a chorus of "yes, doctors."}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(taking off his gloves)}
<D>__{well, it looks like my work here is done.}
<A>__{kumar pulls the gas mask from the patient's face up to his face and takes a deep breath, getting a big hit of nitrous. he then leans down to the bleeding patient, who is just barely conscious but seems in good spirits...}
<C>__{kumar }
<D>__{say, you wouldn't happen to know the quickest way to get to the white castle in cherry hill from here, do you?}
