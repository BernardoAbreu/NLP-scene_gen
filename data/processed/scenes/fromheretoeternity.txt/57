<L>__{interior new congress club mrs. kipfer's living room night}
<B>__{medium shot divan}
<A>__{camera angled so we see only back of the divan. we hear soft chuckles from prew and lorene o.s., then silence for several moments. camera moves as we hear a few more low, intimate laughs, then prew and lorene are disclosed on the couch, their heads close together as if they have just kissed pleasantly but not passionately. mrs. kipfer's living room is on the order of the vestibule; it, too, has a faded lavender feeling. a door leading to another room is half open in b.g. a door leading to a hall is closed. prew's arm is around lorene's shoulder; he is very relaxed, regards her with something like wonder. lorene is mellower, too, making no effort now to be "the princess." she speaks as if resuming a conversation.}
<C>__{lorene}
<D>__{... i enlisted, too. i came out here on my own. to get away from my home town. in oregon.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{lorene}
<D>__{i had a boy friend. i was a waitress. he was from the richest family in town. he just married the girl suitable for his position. after three years of going around with me.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it's a pretty story, isn't it? maybe they could make a movie of it.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{they did. ten thousand of them.}
<C>__{another angle}
<A>__{lorene smiles.}
<C>__{lorene}
<D>__{so i left and went to seattle, as a waitress. and i met a girl just back from hawaii. she said she'd made a lot of money working for mrs. kipfer. i caught the first boat. i've been here a year and two months.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{you like it much?}
<C>__{lorene}
<D>__{oh, i don't like it. but i don't mind it. anyway, i won't be here forever.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{no. sure not. i mean, why should you?}
<C>__{lorene}
<D>__{i have it all figured out. in another year i will be back home, with a pile of bills big enough to choke a steer. and then i will be all set for life }
<A>__{there is a sound at the door and they turn towards it.}
<B>__{medium shot door to hall}
<A>__{as it opens slowly and a disembodied arm pokes through, its hand gripping the neck of a whisky bottle. after a moment, maggio's head follows the arm through the door. he is grinning like an amateur conspirator.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{i dint hear no sounds of combat. so i figgered maybe you'd like a drink.}
<C>__{three shot}
<A>__{as maggio comes into the room.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{or otherwise old sandra would of drank it all by herself. she's a fine girl. but she drinks like a fish.}
<A>__{there are glasses on a cupboard near the divan. maggio sets three of them up, starts to pour whisky into them.}
<C>__{lorene}
<D>__{no, thanks. i never drink much.}
<A>__{maggio stops short of the third glass. he takes a big gulp from the first.}
<C>__{lorene}
<D>__{i think it' a a weakness.}
<C>__{maggio}
<P>__{(another gulp)}
<D>__{i grant you that.}
<C>__{lorene}
<D>__{and i don't like weakness.}
<P>__{(to prew) )}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{no. i don't like weakness.}
<P>__{(rises, takes a drink)}
<D>__{but i like to drink.}
<A>__{he comes back to the divan.}
<C>__{lorene}
<D>__{with you it's not a weakness. with you it's more like a virtue.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{that sounds like a very profound remark. maybe that's why i don't get it.}
<C>__{lorene}
<P>__{(snuggles to prew)}
<D>__{well, it's so.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{hey! what you gonna do, marry this guy? way you grinnin at him you look like his wife!}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{get outa here!}
<C>__{maggio}
<P>__{(picks up bottle)}
<D>__{okay. back to old long legged sandra. i love 'em tall. acres and acres.}
<A>__{he goes out, closing door behind him. suddenly the door opens again and maggio pops back in. he puts the whisky bottle on a table next to the door.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{enjoy yourself, pizon. you need it more than me. you be back with the treatment tomorrow.}
<A>__{he pops out again, the door closing after him. prew's gaiety dims with the reference to the treatment. lorene sees this. prew rises, goes to whisky bottle.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{that was nice before. the way you snuggled up. in front of him.}
<C>__{lorene}
<D>__{what's he mean, the treatment?}
<A>__{prew doesn't answer. he pours a drink, gulps it.}
<C>__{lorene}
<D>__{what did he mean?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{some of the guys puttin me over the jumps because i won't fight.}
<C>__{lorene}
<D>__{fight?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{on the boxing team. i don't want to fight! i don't want to talk about it! i don't want to think about it. and they make me think about it. every day.}
<A>__{he drops down on the divan beside her.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{it's a personal thing...}
<A>__{his dread of telling the tale crumbles before his overwhelming need to tell it, to have someone understand.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{over at port shafter... i used to fight... middleweight. i was pretty good. i used to work out with dixie wells. he was a light heavy, but he was fast... and good. he loved boxing. he was gonna come out of the army and go right into the upper brackets... people on the outside had their eye on him.}
<P>__{(rises, paces)}
<D>__{dixie didn't want, to use the six ounce gloves this time. and we neither of us wore headgear, anyway. i was set flat on my feet when i caught dixie wide with this no more than ordinary solid cross. dixie just happened to be standing solid, too.}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(sits on chair)}
<D>__{from the way he fell i knew. dead weight, square on his face. he dint roll over. he was in a coma a week. then he finally came out of it. the only thing was that he was blind...}
<P>__{(rises, paces)}
<D>__{i went up to the hospital to see him. twice. then i couldn't go back. we got to talking about fighting the second time. and dixie cried... seein tears comin out of those eyes that couldn't see...}
<A>__{there are tears on prew's face. he turns away from lorene.}
<B>__{another angle shooting from behind prew}
<A>__{lorene, very moved, goes to him, stands behind him, puts her hand on his shoulder. prew does not turn but his hand grasps hers. camera moves to close shot of the hands.}
