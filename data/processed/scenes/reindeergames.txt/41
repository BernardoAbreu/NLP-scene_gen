<L>__{interior bathroom same}
<A>__{rudy crouches behind the door, a piece of iron pipe in his grip, ready to strike. listening... listening... as the door slams open, swinging fast and bashing him in the head. rudy tags the floor, drops the pipe, knocked out. merlin and pug gaze down on him, shaking their heads. pug spits tobacco. hits merlin's boots again.}
<L>__{interior truck stop moments later}
<A>__{rudy's back, with a new facial bruise. ashley reaches for his hand; he pulls it away. gabriel unfolds a piece of paper it's a crude map.}
<C>__{gabriel}

<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{and where they hide the real money.}
<A>__{merlin exhales some smoke in pug's face. pug hacks, shoves him.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{and nick? if you even think about setting us up, giving us some bad information? we go down... you go down...}
<P>__{(lets it settle)}

<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{hell. ten?}

<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you'd have to get me inside.}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. then i could work with your map.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{wrong, convict. you walk in there, they recognize you.}
<C>__{pug}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{they recognize him, they'll remember him after the job goes down.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{they won't recognize me.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{why not.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{trust me. they won't recognize me.}

<D>__{we'll trust you when we're rich. why not.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{'cause you're gonna get me a disguise.}
<A>__{rudy locks eyes with gabriel.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i give you the wrong information, you're gonna shoot me. well, i don't know your damn map. so you can either find a way to get me in there... or you can shoot me right now.}
<A>__{a waitress comes over, drops their check on the table. it rests near rudy. rudy locks eyes with gabriel. and pushes the check his way.}
