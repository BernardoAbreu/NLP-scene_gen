<A>__{empty intersections, no traffic to speak of. marcus is looking for a cross street. they're lost.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{see if there's a map.}
<A>__{simon goes through the glove compartment. amid the condoms and parking tickets, he finds one.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{orange county.}
<A>__{he throws it out. he tries to shut the compartment, but it's caught on something. he reaches in...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<A>__{marcus looks over. simon gently pulls out a 9mm baretta. fascinated, he turns it over in his hands. marcus tries to keep an eye on the road.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{don't point it at me!}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{how do i know if it's loaded?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{first, you stop pointing it at me.}
<A>__{simon aims the other way, out the window. as they drive through an intersection, they pass a car full of locals.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{floor. floor!}
<A>__{simon throws the gun to the floor. marcus flinches, expecting it to go off. it doesn't. he checks the rear view mirror. no trouble. simon picks up the gun again.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i've never held a real gun before. it's heavier than i thought.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{great, put it back.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i want to know if it's loaded. how do i...}
<A>__{he starts pulling and pushing on it, trying to get the clip out. he's not going to stop until he does it or shoots himself trying.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{hold the wheel.}
<A>__{marcus removes the clip, hands it over. simon counts the bullets.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i hold ten men's lives in my hand.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{it's a nine millimeter. it doesn't have stopping power.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{right. for that you'd need magnum force.}
