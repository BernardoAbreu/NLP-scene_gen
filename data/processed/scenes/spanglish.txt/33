<L>__{exterior house backyard day}
<A>__{moments later. as the group arrives at the outdoor table. evelyn makes half hearted incomplete gestures of shaking hands, nodding, indicating a seat...each simple act a test which she fails every gesture a bit too late and then some..simply too much for her to manage with the drinks under her belt. in the background workers roll out sod, the yard becoming more beautiful even as we look.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{she is my niece. she and her daughter live in the apartment i manage. yolanda, who worked for you, lived there before she went back home. that's how i heard about the job.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{so who am i interviewing?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{her.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(forcefully)}
<D>__{you're gorgeous.}
<A>__{on our gal..as she, not understanding the word, smiles and nods.}
<C>__{monica}
<P>__{(translating sotto)}
<D>__{vistosos.}
<A>__{our gal thrown. not knowing how now to react.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{she doesn't mean it as a compliment. it's more of an accusation.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{this is my daughter bernice and this is my mother, evelyn norwich..}
<C>__{bernice}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{excuse me...glad you're okay.}
<P>__{(then to other latina)}
<D>__{good luck.}
<A>__{our gal smiles back in appreciation.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{no, stay..this involves you.}
<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{i wouldn't want some kid around for my interview. you understand, mom.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(to bernice)}
<D>__{strength of character..empathy..big heart..taste for futility god i love you.}
<A>__{she eyes with disapproval her mother's empty glass.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{mother!}
<P>__{(then to bernice)}
<D>__{stop. it's just a conversation not an interview. please sit.}
<P>__{(to visitors)}
<D>__{don't you want to get out of the sun?}
<A>__{she indicates a shaded seat. deborah is protected by hat, umbrella, sun glasses while her guest sits bareheaded enjoying the rays and indicates she is fine. underneath deborah's surface is a russian roulette of deeply felt emotions..at this moment she is earnest and vulnerable.}
<D>__{deborah (to our gal) (cont'd) you guys want some lemonade?}
<P>__{(they demur)}
<D>__{let's just talk. i have two children. my husband works nights..he's a chef and has his own place.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{do you work?}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{i helped run a commercial design company until ten months ago when}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{it was downsized to zip. okay. i have two children. i like the house to be like me in that i'm very loose and meticulous at the same time. it's all about first names and closeness here but i care about the place, you know. it's what they used to call homemaker..}
<A>__{the two visitors exchange a wide eyed look. which deborah sees and understands.}
<C>__{deborah }
<P>__{(to monica)}
<D>__{i'm not leaving time for you to translate.}
<A>__{monica says, in spanish, "this woman is very strange. the only thing i understand is she has two kids." deborah leans into monica. face to face, tender but unblinking..}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{too bad for you that it just never occurred to you to check on how much spanish i know.}
<C>__{monica}
<P>__{(a solid beat of humiliation then)}
<D>__{i'm sorry what i say about you...don't hold it against her.}
<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{mom!!}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{i don't speak any spanish. but i'm not an idiot i talk for an hour and you say two words. what did you say?}
<A>__{monica squirms unusual for her.}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{never mind. you got your nose bopped. i got my feelings hurt. onward.}
<A>__{as monica paraphrases what has happened, her translation is dialed down for the:}
<C>__{narrator}
<P>__{(as deborah continues talking)}
<D>__{i will major in linguistics and make sociology my sub concentration. because it has been my experience that the barriers of}
<C>__{narrator }
<D>__{language are more than we dare admit. that, as much as we translate, finally we will never understand each other. my mother's name, for example, beautiful in spanish, becomes leaden and awful when pronounced by a non latin.}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{what's your name? llamo? one of my five spanish words..}
<C>__{our gal}
<D>__{flor moreno.}
<A>__{she pronounces flor in the latin way...lots of rrrr's with a curling of the tongue sound at the end.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{flor.}
<A>__{she pronounces it flat like the "floor" we walk on...throughout the following each of the women sticks to their pronunciation as indicated by the extra "r's.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(correcting)}
<D>__{florrrrr.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{flor.}

<D>__{florrrrr.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{florrrrr.}
<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{it means flower, right?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{yes. flower. florrrrr.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{florrrrr.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{florrrrr.}
<A>__{deborah is beginning to feel criticized...she takes a beat..eyes everyone with some hostility.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(directly to flor)}
<D>__{is there some school of the ear i'm flunking out of right now?}
<A>__{flor says to monica, in spanish, a tip to pronounce her name. monica warns flor to leave it rest..since deborah is becoming clearly and strangely pissed..}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{what did she say?}
<B>__{close on flor...}
<A>__{she feels the tension but, so far in her life, her own irrepressible personality has served her so she moves forward with surprising and quiet confidence and assurance. she tells her aunt to repeat her words so that now, for the first time, she is, through monica, talking directly to deborah.}
<C>__{monica}
<P>__{(translating)}
<D>__{she says..if you curl your tongue and let it be loose you will have it..that it's hard for americans.. she says it's great that you try so hard. many people wouldn't bother.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(an emotional}
<D>__{pronouncement her}
<P>__{greatest accolade)}
<D>__{she gets me....}
<A>__{she smiles at flor, who returns the smile.}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{you want some lemonade? take some lemonade.}
<A>__{she pours some for flor and monica. then she closes her eyes and pauses in utter dedication to a final effort:}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{florrrrr.}
<A>__{it is perfect..flor grins at deborah's victory...claps her hands together.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(a spanish word)}
<D>__{sublime.}
<A>__{deborah feels relief..free for a moment from the dark corridors of self criticism..she is lighter, prettier, innocent..wholly and completely attractive.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{whew, dense but stubborn, right? thanks.}
<P>__{(an important declaration)}
<D>__{what you just did with me is just what kids need..patience and encouragement. alright, money...}
<A>__{bernice rises like a shot to take off..}
<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{goodbye, really..}
<P>__{(to flor)}
<D>__{look forward to seeing you.}
<A>__{as she leaves.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(absently to bernie)}
<D>__{love you...}
<P>__{(then with not a monoseconds break)}
<D>__{... the job is six days a week, seven to seven..the kids and all housekeeping, how much a week would you like?}
<A>__{monica translates..flor, embarrassed a bit by the directness, ducks the question..saying in spanish "whatever you say.."}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{no.. this is an important question..if you ask for too little it means you don't value yourself..too much and you're taking advantage.}
<P>__{(after monica translates)}
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{flor is dumbstruck by the challenge of this pop quiz but not without some native wit and style to maneuver around it.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(extremely heavy accent)}
<D>__{one thousand dollars.}
<A>__{deborah falls for it until flor laughs..others join...deborah now a big smile, snort of a laugh, putting her hand to her face and shaking her head.}
<B>__{other angle..}
<A>__{as monica uses deborah's reaction time to, in mid laugh, flash four fingers to flor..}
<B>__{on evelyn.}
<A>__{catching the gesture and secretly indicating to monica they should go for six.}
<C>__{monica}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{six hundred dollars.}
<A>__{flor shoots her a look of fear...a tense beat.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{welcome to the family..}
<A>__{deborah kisses her..sort of on the mouth. in the midst of flor's delight she is thrown by deborah's kiss...it is the first of many borders to be violated.}
