<L>__{interior rudy's room night}
<B>__{close on sketch}
<A>__{of a floor plan, a sheet of paper overlaid on gabriel's map of the casino. a pencil draws a boxy room and labels it "security video room." then an eraser wipes it out.}
<B>__{widen to reveal rudy}
<A>__{still cuffed to the bedframe, pulled close to a desk. he's sitting, working on the security level map. the door opens; ashley enters, looking worried:}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{he wants to see your map.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i'm almost done.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{he says he wants it now.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{if he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. i'm working on it here.}
<A>__{ashley walks over, puts her arms around his neck. whispers:}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{how are we gonna do this, nick?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you're the getaway girl. the money's gonna get to you eventually. gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. but i can't do that without a gun. any luck talking to him?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{is there any way you could get into his truck?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{we need a gun, ash. we need a gun...}
<A>__{rudy studies his map, then quickly pencils in the "security video room," in a totally different place than he drew it before. hands the paper to her.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{here's the picasso. is he in his room?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{they all are. football's on.}
<C>__{rudy}
<P>__{(nods, thinks)}
<D>__{keep 'em there for a little while.}
<A>__{ashley takes the map, frowns. rudy kisses her gently.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{we're gonna get you out of detroit, ash. get you out of beauty and fragrances.}
<P>__{(smiles, then)}
<D>__{remember that. after all this is over, when you know me, when you really know me... remember it was me.}
<A>__{she searches his eyes, not quite understanding. but smiles. rudy smiles back, nods toward the door. ashley slips out. when she's gone, rudy stands and turns to the window. outside, the blazer with the "ice fishermen do it all year long" bumper sticker still sits parked. rudy reaches for his jeans pocket, and pulls out one of the game room darts, flecked with blood.}
<B>__{he gives it a solemn stare}
