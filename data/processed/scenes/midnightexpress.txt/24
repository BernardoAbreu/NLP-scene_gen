<D>__{the world is now looking at turkey. we are called the heroin supplier of the world. stories about us are in newspapers and on television every day all around the world. the time has come, your honor, to alter this image before we find ourselves isolated and morally ostracized by the rest of the human race...}
<A>__{the courtroom monolithic, frightening, immense with cross currents of greenish light from the enormous windows. people seem insignificant. the prosecutor, wearing dark green glasses, continues, scowling, gesturing profusely at: billy in the prisoners dock, baroque design, isolated. doesn't understand a thing, erich's extra large blue pin striped suit makes him look rather absurd. his father, consul davis, yesil and another lawyer are seated together at the defence table conferring in low tones with each other. yesil looks over at billy with a big reassuring grin, nods his head nothing to worry about. turkish girl from the press with a yellow legal pad, makes notes in the spectator gallery. her legs flare out from a short skirt. billy pries his eyes away to: prosecutor continuing in front of the three judges high on an alice in wonderland podium wearing long black robes with scarlet collars. one of the judges is bald, the other has his eyes closed, could be asleep. the chief judge in the middle has a sagging somewhat kindly face and short grey hair. a young man below the podium, is clacking at an ancient typewriter on a small table.}
