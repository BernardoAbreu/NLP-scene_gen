<A>__{angela's suv races quickly through traffic while john gets her up to speed.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{the myth says mammon was conceived before his father's fall from grace but was born after.}
<L>__{interior suv}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{but unlike his old man, he's never been in the presence of the creator so he has no fear of him, no respect either. that goes double for us god's most prized creations. mammon would be the last demon we'd ever want crossing over.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{but demons can't come and go, that's what you said.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{unless they found a bridge.}

<D>__{some psychic with the chops to reach all the way to hell and the grit to withstand whatever shit she'd pull out.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{isabel...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{but even a bridge wouldn't help mammon. because to cross over, the myth says he'd still need the one thing he could never get. divine assistance. the help of god.}
<A>__{angela sits back, letting that sink in.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{so it's impossible.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{impossible? sure it's impossible. that's what makes it so dangerous. these things exist to break the rules, to find the loopholes. if the past is any indication, then the future isn't on our side.}
<A>__{john sits back, gut churning. angela's in detective mode.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{she knew. that's why she killed herself. but it doesn't make sense...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{makes sense to me.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{john, she sacrificed herself to beat him.}
<A>__{john nods. your point?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{why is she in hell?}
<A>__{one of those rare moments where john has no answer.}
