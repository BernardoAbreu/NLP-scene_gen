<A>__{lt continues his hunt. he comes upon a door that is plastered with "quarantine" signs. one too many, perhaps. lt senses the nun is inside. he has to open the door, but hopes he won't get a blast of disease in his face. he crosses himself wearing a smirk, but nonetheless. going on instinct, lt opens the door a crack. he's right. it's the nun. he positions himself outside the door, keeping it open a few inches. he peeks inside without being seen.}
