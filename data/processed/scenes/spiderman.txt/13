<L>__{extinguisher.}
<A>__{the flames are beaten down enough for her to leap out. flash is there, holding the extinguisher. people cheer.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{thanks for your help flash.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{no problem wimp.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{our hero has a real way with words.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{oh, why don't you grow up.}
<A>__{peter is stung, insulted, turns away. rosomorf peeps in, worried faces thorkel.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{this man will bring a disaster upon this university.}
<A>__{ock comes in, starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has happened.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{the universe is made up of forces... and counter forces. science is the study of the forces!}
<A>__{flash hands the extinguisher to peter. liz embraces flash, throwing a glimpse at peter who tried so bravely. he looks away and turns the last of the extinguisher on the last of the fire.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(continues without a hitch)}
<D>__{but i... professor otto octavius... have devoted my life to the study of the counter forces! good job, peter.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(taking place at lab table)}
<D>__{thanks, professor.}
<A>__{thorkel has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the front of the huge lab. he simply cannot believe ock's behavior.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{i don't believe it, i simply don't...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{can we carry on mr. thorkel.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{i don't believe... oh, all right carry on professor.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{well! this week my dear students i have made a stunning breakthrough...}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{wait a minute, wait a minute... you've got fire forms to fill out, dr. octavius.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{i have no time for forms, or administrators who persist in interrupting me, mr. thorkel.}
<A>__{thorkel steams out and bangs shut the door.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{i now believe its possible that these counter forces can be... collected... the way the magnifying glass collects the sunlight... and focused into a hard beam i call... weiner!}
<A>__{weiner backs away from the blackboard to reveal a word that ock has scrawled in large letters. it says "anti force."}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{i call it, the anti force!}
<A>__{ock is plugging a huge cable into a small lucite box with a silver ball inside it.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(continues as he works)}
<D>__{this anti force, once harnessed, is capable of undoing any natural force at which it is aimed... for instance...}
<P>__{(looks up maniacally)}
<D>__{gravity!}
<A>__{liz scribbles down a note and mouths the word "gravity." then she turns to peter.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i'm sorry...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{it's alright.}
<A>__{ock is "playing" his computer like the phantom of the opera at the organ.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{we patch in the cyclotron... the lights flicker and go dim.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{pay no attention to the lights... i of course steal its energy, and it looses power. we patch in the cyclotron... and we gradually apply power. the power that i am stealing...}
<A>__{as the whine builds in the lab... ock peers through the lucite box at us, distorted by it. the box is a miniature version of the cyclotron's experimental chamber, and now the blue white glow begins. it crackles round the silver ball.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{and so we stand, four square against the fundamental force that orders and maintains our universe... gravity... which is holding down this goddamn ball. rise!}
<A>__{the lights go totally dark. the kids react with whoops and catcalls.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what a crock...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{shut up harry... this is very interesting.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{mr. parker! have you some... interesting observation you'd like to share with the class?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no sir...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{then shut up! and pay some attention to the experiment.}
<A>__{ock peers at us through the lucite box as the silver ball begins to rise. ock's face is ecstatic.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{rise! rise!!!}
<A>__{the silver ball suddenly shoots up, shattering the top of the box. it flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a}
<B>__{light fixture.}
<A>__{the shards rain down on ock who reaches out and catches the falling ball and scales it in a raised fist.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{now that's what i call an experiment!}
<A>__{the cyclotron whine cuts out and ock wheels to the computer. he hits a key and several colored projection beams lance out of the back of the room. they pierce the smoke and light a projection display in the front. two colored spheres one, yellow, one blue touch where their circumferences meet. behind them is a black depiction of "space".}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{you are looking at a representation of two universes. our blue one. our real universe... something we can touch and feel and see and draw calculations about. this is us. the yellow universe... this is something else. some other dimension... something... on the other side!}
<A>__{ock hits another computer key and a hole appears where the two spheres touch. the blue and the yellow marbleize with each other. the colors swirl until both spheres are}
<C>__{bright green.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{if it were possible to generate enough power behind it, the anti force could wipe out not just gravity... but all our universal forces at the same time. in effect... it would blast a hole between this universe and the nexterior each...}
<P>__{(indicates green spheres)}
<D>__{would flow into each other. no blue universe. no yellow. end, finished, over.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(with a student's ear)}
<D>__{that sounds like a scenario for the end of the world.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{my girl, it is! it is. it would mean wiping out everything that's known... and letting in everything that's unknown.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{isn't that a little dangerous?}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{don't worry yourself, true inter dimensional penetration is still purely theoretical, but one day... maybe very near... maybe in the 21st century...}
