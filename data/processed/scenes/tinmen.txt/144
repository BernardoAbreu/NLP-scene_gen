<A>__{an area has been set up for hearings to take place. this seems to be a temporary headquarters until something sub stantial can be worked out. there are boxes and crates all over. there's a long table with a number of commis sioners behind it, and a defense table a little way across the room. microphones are being used, and the sound booms echoing off the walls. a small gallery of people are watching the proceedings.}

<C>__{masters }
<D>__{so, you weren't dangling a free set of storm windows as a come on to selling them the aluminum siding job? because it says here, and i'm reading from a statement from mr. tabaleri...}
