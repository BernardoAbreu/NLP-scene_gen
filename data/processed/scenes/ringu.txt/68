<A>__{back to the beach. asakawa comes running up toward ryuji and the prone mr. yamamura. suddenly there is another}
<B>__{flash}
<A>__{asakawa, her eyes wide, finds herself inside the scene, reliving it as if she had actually been there. she watches as shizuko receives a sealed clay pot in both hands. shizuko regards the pot a moment and then places it gently on the table before her. she takes a calligraphy stylus from the table, begins writing on a thin, rectangular sheet of rice paper. the members of the press talk excitedly, craning their necks for a better look. onstage, a judge holds up the phrase written by shizuko and the folded sheet of paper taken from the sealed pot. the phrase on both sheets is identical.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{match.}
<A>__{cameras begin flashing excitedly. shizukos features melt into a soft smile. the experiment is performed again, and again the phrase written by shizuko corresponds to the sealed sheet of paper.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{match.}
<A>__{again and again, shizuko unerringly demonstrates her power to see the unseen. finally, a bearded reporter explodes from his chair, begins striding angrily towards the stage.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{faker! this is nothing but trickery, and the lowest form of trickery at that.}
<A>__{the reporter stops at the foot of the stage, points his finger accusingly at shizuko.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{what are you trying to pull, woman?}
<A>__{a second reporter sitting in the front row also rises to his feet.}
<D>__{reporter #2 thats right! professor ikuma, youre being fooled!}
<A>__{by now most of the press has risen from their chairs, pointing and shouting angrily. onstage, shizuko backs away, eyes wide and frightened. she covers both ears, trying to block out the increasing din. professor ikuma holds her protectively by the shoulders. the first reporter is still shouting angrily, his voice rising above the others. suddenly, a pained look crosses his face and he collapses to the floor. the crowd, and asakawa as well, see that the reporters face is contorted into a grotesque mask of fear.}
<D>__{reporter #3 whats happened? reporter #4 hes dead! reporter #5}
<P>__{(to shizuko)}
<D>__{witch!}
<A>__{professor ikuma begins leading shizuko offstage. they stop as someone unseen steps up, blocking their passage. shizukos eyes widen, her head shaking in disbelief.}
<C>__{shizuko}
<D>__{sadako? was it you?}
