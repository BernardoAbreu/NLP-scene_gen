<L>__{interior anthony living room}
<A>__{the scene opens on a closeup of a man's hands. one of them is semi flexed and turning slowly, the other is receiving the final touches of a manicure. camera pulls back to reveal that these are bruno's hands, and that, he is studying them moodily, camera pulls back farther to reveal his mother, mrs. anthony, sitting opposite him at a little table in the anthony living room. she is working with scissors, file and nail buffer. mrs. anthony is a gentle, once pretty woman, whose pastel exterior harbors a tigress like determination to protect her son, bruno is in his robe and is unshaven. there is evidence of long established wealth in the heavy dark appointments of this room.}
<C>__{mrs. anthony}
<D>__{since you insisted on a manicure, dear, i do wish you'd keep your hands quiet. you're so restless lately.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(almost dreamily as}
<D>__{he admires the free}
<P>__{hand)}
<D>__{i like them to look just right.}
<A>__{mrs. anthony looks up, notices his moody expression.}
<C>__{mrs. anthony}

<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{no, ma. they look fine. thanks.}
<C>__{mrs. anthony}
<D>__{then what's the matter?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i'm all right, ma. don't worry about me.}
<C>__{mrs. anthony}
<D>__{you look so pale, dear. are you out of vitamins?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i bought a bottle of them yesterday. a whole fifth.}
<C>__{mrs. anthony}
<P>__{(anxiously)}
<D>__{but you have that 'look'. i can always tell. you haven't got into any more mischief, bruno?}
<A>__{he denies this with a slow, solemn shake of his head.}
<C>__{mrs. anthony}
<D>__{i do hope you've forgotten about that silly little plan of yours?}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{which one?}
<C>__{mrs. anthony}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{about blowing up the white house?}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(his eyes dancing)}
<D>__{i was only kidding, ma. besides, what would the president say?}
<C>__{mrs. anthony}
<P>__{(laughing gaily)}
<D>__{you're a naughty boy, bruno. but you can always make me laugh.}
<P>__{(she rises)}
<D>__{now get shaved, dear, before your father gets home.}
<A>__{bruno's fist crashes down on the little table, upsetting it, as he gets to his feet.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i'm sick and tired of bowing and scraping to the king.}
<C>__{mrs. anthony}
<P>__{(placating him)}
<D>__{now, now, let's not lose control. come see my painting, dear }
<P>__{(she leads him toward an easel)}
<D>__{i do wish you'd take up painting. it's such a soothing pastime.}
<A>__{they look at the painting.}
<B>__{insert}
<A>__{the painting is a horrible mess. out of the violence of the pattern a man's face can be discerned, wild eyed and distorted. we hear laughter from bruno.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{bruno's roar of laughter puzzles mrs. anthony, but she is pleased to hear his good humor. he puts an arm around her.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{you're wonderful, ma! it's the old boy, all right. that's father!}
<C>__{mrs. anthony}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{it is? i was trying to paint saint francis.}
<A>__{at this moment there is the sound of the front door opening. then immediately the telephone bell rings in the hall. bruno is instantly alert, as if he had been expecting a call. he goes toward the door to the hall, as the butler enters.}
<C>__{butler}
<P>__{(to bruno)}
<D>__{they are ready with your call to southampton, sir.}
<A>__{bruno's father mr. anthony, purposefully enters the living room. he an impeccably dressed business man with an uncompromising eye. his entrance momentarily blocks bruno's exit.}
<C>__{mrs. anthony}
<P>__{(to her husband)}
<D>__{how nice that you're early, charles. i will tell cook....}
<A>__{bruno now exits into the hall, passing his father without speaking.}
<C>__{mr. anthony}
<D>__{just a minute, eunice.}
<P>__{(calls after bruno)}
<D>__{bruno! come here! i want to talk to you and your mother.}
