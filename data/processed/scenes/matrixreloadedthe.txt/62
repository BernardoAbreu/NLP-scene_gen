<L>__{interior cockpit (night)}
<A>__{morpheus and neo sit together. the cockpit lights are dimmed down, only the emp pulse button glows. outside the ship, in the dark mists of the underworld, patches of eerie phosphorescent moss glow on the walls. occasionally, a squiddie will pass over the darkened ship.}
<D>__{the two of them watch the deadly outside world.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{were deep in their territory.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i see that.}
<A>__{morpheus stares out at the night, deep in thought. he turns to neo.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{are you rested?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{you know now, that you had predecessors.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{yes. ive heard things.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{what types of things?}
<C>__{neo}
<A>__{"that there were others, like me, who you thought were going to be}
<D>__{special. but they ended up dead." morpheus nods slowly.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"its true. there were others. and i didnt tell you right away.}
<D>__{because you were not ready." neo nods.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{does this anger you?}
<C>__{neo}
<A>__{"i dont know yet. so much has happened so fast, that i cant decide whether or not im angry, or dissappointed, or even if i should be."}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"you shouldnt be, neo. you are the key in the oracles prophecy.}
<D>__{everything forseen to come to pass, has, except one thing."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{the destruction of the matrix. morpheus looks out into the darkness.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"your coming was heralded, and it is my destiny to prepare the world for you, and to baptize you by fire. but from here on out, no one}
<D>__{knows."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{can we ask the oracle.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{not in this life. neo is confused.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"no one has heard from her or her priestesses since the day cypher}
<D>__{turned on us." neo is taken aback.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{but she must have known, if they came to her.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{perhaps she did. neo shakes his head.}
<C>__{neo}
<A>__{"i cant believe it. i dont know, morpheus, if im prepared for this}
<D>__{war. im not a soldier. how, how are we going to win?"}
<C>__{morphues}
<A>__{"for decades, we have fought force on force, in the real world, without a conclusion. now, after nearly a century of war, were at a standstill. the only way that we can see to win is by destroying their source of energy. we have to pull the plug on them. we must crash the}
<D>__{matrix." morpheus grins slyly.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"remember, when i told you, that ill show you how deep the rabbit}
<D>__{hole goes?"}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"i brought you deep, yet i no longer know the way. no one does. with every second we sink deeper than before. you are our guiding light, now. your powers exceed mine a millionfold. i have shown you the path}
<D>__{to victory, neo. lead us down it."}
