<L>__{interior malahide's bedroom day}
<A>__{we are looking at a reflection of malahide in the large mirror that covers the inside of his wardrobe door. his real hand and his reflected hand come together at the edge of the door and tip it slightly, changing the image that the mirror shows us. now we see julia. she is in the dress from the shop in the mall. it is a perfect fit and shows her figure off very well. being a halter neck, however, her skinned arms and shoulders are completely bare. also, it is quite low cut at the front, exposing a fair degree of visceral cleavage, and at the back. julia turns fully around in front of the mirror examining herself from every angle. her mood is unreadable until she speaks.}
<C>__{julia}

<A>__{malahide does so. he understands and tries to console her..}
