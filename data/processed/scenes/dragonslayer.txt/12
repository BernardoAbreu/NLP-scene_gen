<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{hodge}
<A>__{hodge marches along with the rest. when he's sure no one else is looking he burrows into his garments and brings out the leather pouch containing ulrich's ashes. reassured that it's still with him, he tucks it away again. galen falls into step.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{what have you got there?}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{none of your business.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{a little gold, eh? what do you say i change it into lead?}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{save your jokes for someone else. me, i don't care for braggarts.}
<A>__{they pass valerian, who has dropped out of line.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{and i don't care for frauds.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i'm no fraud.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{call it fool then. upstart. whatever pleases you.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{hodge, nobody forced you to come along.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{oh, i'm here of my own free will, all right. we each do the master's bidding in our own way.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{well, if he told you i needed wetnursing, why don't you just turn yourself around and go back home.}
<A>__{hodge snorts and fusses with his pack.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{home, is it? you've seen to that, haven't you? gone to seed, i'd say...}
<A>__{he glances over and discovers galen missing.}
<B>__{galen}
<A>__{he walks back along the trail, looking for valerian. pretty soon the rest of the travelers are out of sight. he hears the sound of a splash. he turns off the trail and pushes through some shrubbery.}
<B>__{forest pool}
<A>__{under the oaks and hickory, a forest stream has widened into a quiet pool. a pile of clothes lies on a rock at the edge. out in the middle, valerian is treading water.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{you're too far behind us. come on out.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{you go ahead, i will catch up.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{not a good idea to get separated. let's go.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{right. i will be along.}
<A>__{galen leans over and splashes some water on his face. feels good. he shucks his pack and starts to throw off his clothes. valerian doesn't like it.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{that's all right. don't come in.}
<A>__{but galen is now naked and walking into the water. he swims out toward valerian.}
<C>__{valerian}
<P>__{(edgy)}
<D>__{you better get back to the group, they're probably worried.}
<A>__{galen keeps swimming.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{i prefer to swim alone, if you don't mind.}
<A>__{but galen has slipped beneath the surface; he doesn't hear.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{galen works his way through the murky green underwater world. suddenly, he stops short and stares. he's only a few feet from valerian's dangling legs. he gasps in surprise. valerian is no boy.}
<B>__{on the surface}
<A>__{galen comes shooting to the surface, coughing and sputtering.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{by the gods!}
<A>__{valerian is pale and frightened.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{stay away.}
<A>__{she propels herself backward, then turns and swims for shore.}
<B>__{on the shore}
<A>__{galen and valerian have taken refuge behind separate bushes. briskly they pull on their clothes.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{i suppose you'll tell everyone. go ahead, i don't care. it's a relief.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i'm not going to say anything.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{i don't blame you. i was stupid. careless. a silly woman!}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(feeble bluff)}
<D>__{take it easy. i knew the moment i saw you. i've known the whole time.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{you never knew a thing. no one knew. not since i was born. go on, run off and tell them. it'll make a great story.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{don't worry. no one's going to find out. just tell me: why?}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{ask my father.}
<A>__{they finish dressing in silence. finally:}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{the lottery! daughters are chosen, but sons are not!}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{that's right. unless you have plenty of gold or property.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{if you're rich enough, your name never goes in.}
<P>__{(bitter)}
<D>__{my father is poor. so are a lot of fathers.}
<A>__{he studies her. she jams a hat down over her head and, once more the young man, stalks off.}
<B>__{the vision}
<A>__{galen walks down to the edge of the pool to retrieve his pack. as he leans over he catches sight of what appears to be a reflection in the water: tyrian on horseback. he whips around, but no one is behind him. riveted by the vision, he hurries along the bank to follow it. after a few paces the blurry figure dismounts, unslings a longbow, nocks an arrow and draws the string taut.}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{no!}
<B>__{forest}
<A>__{galen sprints through the trees. up ahead is valerian, walking resolutely.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she glances back at him and grimly keeps on walking. galen shoots past her and on into the forest.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{hodge!}
<B>__{travelers}
<A>__{galen races up the trail rounds a bend and sees the urlanders coming toward him. hodge precedes the group with an unsteady gait. he sees galen, raises up his arms and flops face down on the trail. a long arrow protrudes from his back. galen kneels beside him. the uneasy company keeps its distance. hodge struggles to speak.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{galen? can you hear me?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i hear you.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{you know, somebody shot me, but i can still talk. there's something that has to be done.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{not that cockatrice. ulrich's ashes. here.}
<A>__{hodge's hand comes out from under his coat gripping the leather pouch. galen tugs at it, but hodge can't let go.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{take it. sorry, you'll have to peel it loose.}
<A>__{galen pries the sack out of hodge's clenched fingers. suddenly the hand comes up, grabs galen by the hair, and pulls him near.}
<C>__{hodge}
<P>__{(a croak)}
<D>__{...burning water... find the lake, throw it in...}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(holding up the pouch)}
<D>__{what are you doing with this, hodge?}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{...burning water...}
<A>__{he dies. galen frees himself from his grasp.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{hodge, don't die. listen to me. you're not going to die.}
<A>__{galen is frantic. he pulls out the amulet and wraps his hand around it.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{excede, mortem! revoca, vitam!}
<P>__{(he shakes the body)}
<D>__{excede, mortem! revoca, vitam!}
<A>__{but hodge has passed on, and galen's magic has no way to reach him. suddenly the youth cries out in pain. he drops the amulet and looks at his palm. the device has burned his flesh. now he becomes aware of troubled urlanders looking over his shoulder, witness to his failure.}
