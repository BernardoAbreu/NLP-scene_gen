<A>__{diego puts a straw in his nose and snorts a big gakker. his eyes are wide, his pupils dilated, and a weapon sticks out of the back of his pants. he knocks the dust off his nose before moving outside. george is on the porch, smoking a cigarette.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{three years. how long have we been in business? three years. does she get to meet your connection? was she good enough?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{shut up, diego. they're going to be here any minute. i'm trying to concentrate.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{i'm very angry with you, george. very angry. you don't take me to california, but you take your bitch wife? a woman? i understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this. you and me.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what do you need my connection for, diego? what are you going to do with it?}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{what do i do with it? nothing. it's for peace of mind. it's for the principle.}
<A>__{george doesn't have time for this. he checks the cylinders on his weapon and runs over possible scenarios in his mind. but diego won't get off the soap box.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{jesus fucking christ, diego. i ain't telling you. it's just business. now, shut up. you're driving me crazy.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{i'm driving you crazy? no. you're driving me crazy. we had a dream. what happened to our dream?}
<A>__{a black sedan pulls up and five puerto rican men approach the room. george and diego greet them and lead them inside. it's game time. the atmosphere is charged with danger and everyone is acutely aware of everything. the guys sit down, their guns bulging through the inside of their suits. the suitcases are opened. the rules are the same. no english. no raising voices. no sudden movements. george offers their leader, tony, beers for his men, and is politely declined. the count starts. george and diego riff through ten thousand dollar bundles. diego is still acting pissy. he's mumbling to himself, making faces, slamming the money all around. the guys keep a close eye on him. diego finishes a stack, throws one of the bags on the ground. the conversation is in spanish unless otherwise indicated.}
