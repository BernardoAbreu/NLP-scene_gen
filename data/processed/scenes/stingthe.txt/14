<L>__{exterior pawnshop looking inside day}
<A>__{hooker is getting a radio and well worn suit out of hook. it's like seeing old friends again. all pantomime.}
<L>__{interior hooker's room day}
<A>__{a shabby little place he rents above a cigar store. we pick him up in a jerry built outdoor shower, which he's rigged up on the fire escape. the rinse water drips down through the landing into the grimy alley below.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{'with plenty of money and you oo oo, oh baby, what i wouldn't do oo oo...'}
<B>__{on the street again}
<A>__{jauntily carrying a magnum of champagne and some flowers, obviously on his way to see someone special.}
<B>__{in a burlesque house}
<A>__{hooker stands in the wings holding the flowers and champagne, watching his date for the evening, a 6'3" stripper named crystal, do her routine. crystal finishes up and comes off the stage.}
<C>__{crystal}
<P>__{(tired)}
<D>__{hi, hooker, you gettin' married or somethin'?}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{come into a little dough. you wanna get outa here tonight?}
<C>__{crystal}
<D>__{can't. i got a 10 o'clock show. i need the five bucks.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{i will spend fifty on ya.}
<A>__{crystal looks at him a second and starts to giggle. we're pretty sure she's gonna get outa here tonight. coming into a poor man's gambling joint little more than a reconverted brick basement, the place contains three shoddy, homemade roulette tables. hooker, accompanied now by crystal, nods a greeting to the doorman and proceeds to a table where there are already several other people laying their bets for the next spin. hooker knows the wheel man, an old timer named jimmy.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(glad to see him)}
<D>__{hooker!}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{how ya doin', jimmy.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(collecting bets and paying off the winners)}
<D>__{ain't seen you in months, boy. thought maybe you took a fall.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{naw, just a little hard times, that's all. it's all over now.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you gonna have a go here?}
<P>__{(pointing to the betting board)}
<D>__{how 'bout a ten spot on the line here. the 4 9 been lookin' good today. lotsa action on 28th street down there, too. pay ya 10 1.}
<A>__{as jimmy finishes his spiel, he starts the wheel spinning and drops in the ball. betting is allowed to continue until the ball drops from the outer ring into the center.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(taking out his wallet)}
<D>__{three grand on the black.}
<A>__{jimmy is stunned. the others at the table, used to dollar bets, look at hooker like he's some kind of foreign dignitary.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{you sure you wanna start off that big? bet like that could put a real dent in us.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{i feel lucky tonight.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{aw, come on, hooker, why don't you just...}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{three grand on the black, jimmy.}
<A>__{jimmy wants to argue some more, but the ball is getting ready to drop into the center. we see jimmy quickly press a hidden lever under the table with his foot. the ball falls and settles into red 27 with a motion that is not quite right. the others at the table fail to notice, but hooker is not fooled. he stares venomously at jimmy, who knows that hooker is on to him.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{sorry, hooker.}
<P>__{(making an attempt at levity, in order to explain)}
<D>__{good thing that ball came up red. guy could get in trouble around here, losin' a bet that big.}
<A>__{jimmy reaches for hooker's money. hooker stops him by putting his hand on it.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{spin it again.}
<A>__{jimmy doesn't know what the hell to do. he gives hooker a little head motion to indicate a small window high up in one of the walls. behind it, we see a pair of eyes. suddenly, hooker understands why jimmy had to cheat him, but it doesn't change his demand.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{spin it anyway, jimmy.}
<A>__{jimmy is beside himself. if he doesn't spin again, hooker may expose him. if he does spin, and loses, his management will fire him. he pleads to hooker with his eyes, but it's no use. jimmy spins the wheel and reluctantly drops in the ball. this time there is no foot on the lever, and it settles into black 15. hooker stares at the ball a second and then looks up at his terrified friend.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{don't worry, pal. i knew it was my night.}
<A>__{hooker pushes the money over to jimmy and walks out of the room. he's lost $3,000, but he's still working on a lucky night.}
