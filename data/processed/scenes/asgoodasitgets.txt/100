<C>__{carol}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{we are on simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he faces the bathroom and we have... simon's pov carol sitting at tub's edge a towel around her and now as simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair the towel falls a better than perfect breast exposed...}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{simon}

<D>__{hold it.}
<A>__{he leaves the bed.}
<B>__{angles on hotel desk}
<A>__{what's he up to... he takes the blotter from the desk set and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of the bed where he turns on the light and stares at carol.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i've got to sketch you.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{no... absolutely not. i'm shyer than you think. i give the wrong impression sometimes and...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{stop staring. do a vase.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{but you're beautiful... your skin glows.}

<C>__{simon}
<D>__{that long neck the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. you're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{all right, cut me a break.}
<A>__{simon's pen moves across the blotter carol sees him earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly but deliberately she lowers the towel. he's right. she's breathtaking.}
