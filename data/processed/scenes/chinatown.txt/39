<A>__{gittes, driven in a station wagon, passes under the sign with a cross painted below the name. the ranch itself is only partially in a valley on the island. as the wagon continues one can see that it is actually a miniature california, encompassing desert, mountains and canyon that tumble down palisades to the windward side of the sea. the wagon comes to a halt where a group of hands are clustered around a corral. the circle of men drift apart, leaving julian cross standing, using a cane for support, reedy but handsome in a rough linen shirt and jeans. when he talks his strong face is lively, in repose it looks ravaged.}
