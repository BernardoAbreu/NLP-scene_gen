<A>__{angle on: frodo and sam following gollum up the dizzying stairway, carved into the sheer cliff. the steps are narrow, unevenly spaced, and many are broken. they are so steep that frodo and sam climb as if on a ladder their desperate fingers clinging to the steps above trying not to look at the long black fall below them. angle on: frodo's foot slips and for a brief moment he is hanging precariously from the rock face.}

<D>__{careful, master careful! very far to fall. very dangerous on the stairs.}
