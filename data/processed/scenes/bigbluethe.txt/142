<L>__{exterior committee boat day}
<A>__{enzo and roberto are on the front deck watching the divers. a german diver comes up to the surface, empty handed. enzo smiles. the tahitian comes out of the water in a semi coma. the doctors carry him away. once he's sure that the diver is out of danger, enzo smiles again. a whole team of japanese walk over to the diving platform. the team consists of one diver and six assistants, three of them playing music to help the diver concentrate. the diver wears a white wet suit with a red circle on his forehead. he is concentrating very hard, so much that enzo walks over to him to make sure he's okay. the japanese diver concentrates with such strength that he faints.}
