<L>__{interior gina's apartment day}
<A>__{jean watches "the little rascals" on tv in the living room. the sound is turned off and a record player plays gypsy music loudly. rolled up in a large drop cloth, gina is asleep on the floor. next to her, jean works on all fours, drawing figures, crowns, and houses. working feverishly, he writes "hey, hey, hey" in big clusters, then writes other words: shark, immortality, john the revelator, fame, ink, teeth, hawaii supermarket, pole star, baboon and tar. he has an acoustics manual and bible open on the floor. he copies the technical blueprints from the manual. he reads the bible, following the text with a dirty finger. it seems that he watches tv, draws, listens to the music and reads at the same time. he mixes liquitex paints and puts some colors on the drawings. he draws a long blue line and carries it over onto the floor. up the wall. through the fridge. across the window. he takes off his paint covered clothes and changes into gina's black slip. he rummages around the room, gathering pieces of his and gina's clothes. he spreads the clothes on the floor, and selecting wide brushes with long bristles, picks up the cans of liquitex painterior when paint spills on the clothes, he spreads it into shapes. gina wakes up. she reaches for one of the painted shirts.}
