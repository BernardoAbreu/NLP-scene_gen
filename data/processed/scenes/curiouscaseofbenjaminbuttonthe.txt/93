<A>__{the tugboat making its way through the fog... benjamin standing with daisy on the prow... the wind in their faces... and suddenly out of the fog a horn blares... as loud as anything they have ever heard... and moving out of the mist, horn still echoing, a huge ocean liner appears... with three other tugboats pushing it to sea...}

<D>__{she put in for repair... a wounded duck... she's flyin' now...}
<A>__{captain mike joins the tugs at the liner's side... the tugs sounding horns of their own... a symphony of a kind... what interests benjamin...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{what does it take to build something like that?}
<A>__{passengers line the railing... continuing their adventure... and what interests daisy...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{imagine all the places they're going to see...}
<A>__{daisy, thrilled, waves to them the passengers along the rail, waving back... benjamin stands by daisy, their hair blowing in the salty air....}
<C>__{daisy }
<P>__{(to benjamin)}
<D>__{i wish we could go with them...}
<A>__{as they watch the liner, like a foggy dream, sailing away...}
