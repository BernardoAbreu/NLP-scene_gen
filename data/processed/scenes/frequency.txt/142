<D>__{he ain't our guy, john.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. not everyone fits the profile.}
<A>__{long beat.}
<C>__{satch}
<D>__{if he was gonna give something up he would'a done it already.}
<A>__{john pauses for several seconds, then nods slowly.}

<A>__{suspicious minds filters in. frank zips up, heads to the sink. bends over to wash his hands, and suddenly. his face is smashed on the edge of the sink. he twists to the floor, fighting to maintain consciousness. a black frye boot explodes into frank's gut. he rolls over, looks up at the long haired guy from the bar. frank seems to recognize him. we know him too scraggly man. but we don't know his name yet. so we'll call him...}
<C>__{killer}
<D>__{you following me?}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{killer's eyes, evil fuckin' black dots. he lifts frank to his knees. then rips a fist into frank's face.}
<C>__{killer }
<D>__{i asked you a question, asshole.}
<A>__{frank is clearly incapacitated. killer lifts him to his feet so they are eye to eye.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(barely able to speak)}
<D>__{mary finelli...}
<A>__{a look of absolute shock wipes across the killer's face.}
<C>__{killer}
<D>__{who the fuck are you?}
<A>__{caught off guard, frank is able to slam his knee into killer's balls. killer goes down like a stone, but frank is too battered to take advantage. he collapses on top of killer, who pushes him off, scrambles up, and delivers a massive kick to his head. frank is out cold. quickly, killer rolls frank over and rifles his pockets finding his wallet. he grabs something from it, then tosses it aside. he then takes something out of his pocket, a thin leather garrote. he coils it around his hands and snaps it taut. he bends down to start the job when suddenly, the bathroom door opens and... two very stoned men stumble in.}
<D>__{stoned man #1 whoa, dude. is he okay?}
<C>__{killer}
<D>__{yeah. he just needs a little time kissing the porcelain.}
<A>__{and killer muscles frank into a toilet stall and puts his head in the bowl. he closes the door, quickly leaving. in the stall, frank spills onto the floor, his legs sticking out into the bathroom. his face flush to the tile, his eyes trying to focus on something lying just outside the stall... his wallet.}
