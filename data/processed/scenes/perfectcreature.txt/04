<L>__{int: hospital, operation room day}
<A>__{pov, baby's view, in an operating theatre. cut to the woman we saw earlier with the genetic doctor; she has just given birth. the baby is placed on linen blankets and cleaned by a nurse. a man now enters the operating theatre; we can tell the doctor is uneasy. the man is dressed in a perfectly cut suit. he does not wear a surgical mask. his eyes are a piercingly clear light gray. he enters with two other men who look similar to him. by his side there is also a pristine boy; perhaps 8 years old, the same piercing eyes. they both approach the baby. the man stares serenely at the baby, all bloody, lying on blankets.}

<D>__{this is your brother silus. you will teach him.}
<A>__{the little boy then shares a glance with the woman who has just given birth. she seems to recognize the boy.}
<C>__{silus as a boy}
<D>__{is that my mother?}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{no, not any more.}
<A>__{augustus then leans forward and gently opens the baby's mouth. we see the baby close. in the otherwise baby like mouth we see something strange. there are two tiny fangs protruding from the otherwise smooth gums. we see augustus smile. in his mouth too, we see two perfectly pointed teeth.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{welcome to the world little brother.}
<A>__{cut to we end close on the baby; its piercing eyes.}
