<LOC>__{INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{ANDREW MARSH lies on his back in bed.  He is a frail-looking man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair.  On top of him is a much younger WOMAN.  Although her back is to us, we catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side to side.  We see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman. She moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts.  She reaches down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him deeper inside her.  They move together -- faster -- and faster. The CAMERA slowly begins to PULL BACK.  As it does we see what we are watching is on a TELEVISION. Further back still.  We see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS standing before the television watching the act. The CAMERA begins to pan around the room.  Rain streaks down the windows of the room -- LIGHTNING flashes outside.  A VIDEO CAMERA is set up on a tripod.  More PLAIN CLOTHES POLICE, looking, dusting, talking. We continue to PAN.  We can now see it is the same room on the tape.  ON the bed lies the naked body of ANDREW MARSH, a sheet covering his lower torso.  His face is ashen, mouth open, his dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare.  The last instant of his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{LIGHTNING fills the night sky.  THUNDER BOOMS overhead.  The wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path. The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES.  At the end is a cul-de-sac.  Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway, their RED LIGHTS FLASHING. A four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway.  JOHN CARDENAS steps out into the rain.  He is a handsome Latin in his thirties, with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair. He does not run through the rain -- he walks. DETECTIVE REESE, a man who looks more like an accountant than a homicide detective runs out to meet him.}

<DIAL>__{Is it Marsh?}
<CHAR>__{REESE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<ACTION>__{Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas' face.  It lasts an instant, then it's gone.}
<CHAR>__{REESE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sir, do you mind if we get out of the rain?}

<ACTION>__{Pull back to reveal a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snapping pictures of Marsh in bed. Cardenas enters followed by Reese.  He moves through the FORENSIC and MEDICAL TEAMS.  Anything Cardenas feels about the gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of indifference. Standing by the bed is ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ROGER TROXELL, a short, baby-faced man.  Cardenas looks down at the body, then over at the MEDICAL EXAMINER, DR. HENRY McCURDY, a portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes.}

<ACTION>__{JOANNE BRASLOW sits on chair.  Her eyes are tired -- red from crying.  She is mid thirties -- attractive, but her looks come more from effort than nature -- expensive hair cut -- the right cosmetics.  She has a corporate look to her. Cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her.}

<DIAL>__{Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?}

<DIAL>__{But there's more?}
<ACTION>__{They reach a door and stop.}
<CHAR>__{MCCURDY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's speculative at this point. Marsh had advanced Arterial disease. His heart attack was induced by excessive aerobic activity -- in conjunction with the drug.}

<LOC>__{INT.  CARDENAS' OFFICE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Spacious and sparsely furnished.  The walls are empty.  No commendations, plaques or photographs to add prestige to the office.  Cardenas steps into the room and looks at McCurdy who is already seated next to Reese and Troxell.}

<CHAR>__{CARDENAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What can we prove?}
<CHAR>__{MCCURDY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.}
<CHAR>__{CARDENAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Any prints on the nasal spray?}

<DIAL>__{Marsh's and Rebecca Lawson's.}

<DIAL>__{A man across the street from Marsh saw her drive up about four thirty Sunday afternoon.  And her prints are all over the place.}

<CHAR>__{TROXELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?}

<CHAR>__{CARDENAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So she knew about his heart?}
<CHAR>__{TROXELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.}

RAYMOND SATTLER, a tall, distinguished-looking man in his sixties stands beside her.  He supports his weight with the aid of a CANE.  The service concludes.  Sattler along with several other PEOPLE offer her their condolences.  Joanne Braslow is there.  She does not go over to Rebecca. CARDENAS AND REESE stand off to the side by a large oak tree.

Her eyes are tired -- heavy from crying -- but no tears show now.  This is a woman whose grief is private and not displayed for others.  Although emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful.  So beautiful that even Cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide how impressed he is.}

<CHAR>__{CARDENAS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?}
<CHAR>__{SATTLER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.}

<DIAL>__{Did I say it was a natural death?}

MOONLIGHT washes over her body, SILHOUETTING her.  She runs her hands lightly over her stomach -- working her way up to her round, full breasts.  She stops for a moment -- and we sense she knows Dulaney is watching her. Dulaney stares at her -- mesmerized.  He knows he should turn away, but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look. One by one Rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans, revealing her sheer, white panties.  She bends forward slightly and slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles -- then steps out of them. We can see the desire on Dulaney's face.  He looks away.  The conflict inside him grows.  He looks back. Rebecca walks into the hall.  She is barefoot --  wearing a long, slinky dress -- her eyes catch Dulaney's.  If she wasn't aware he was watching her before -- she is now.  It doesn't seem to bother her.  She moves towards him slowly -- her eyes inviting his. Dulaney moves towards her.  They meet in the middle of the room.  She waits -- he moves closer -- so close that he can smell her.
