<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{solomon walks along a well worn path, shopping bag draped over one shoulder. we see his feet. as the walk slowly gathers pace, solomon suddenly turns left into dense foliage. his tread is now a full blown sprint, trees flash past as solomon attacks his way through the woods. the sound of branches cracking underneath. his feet, heartbeat and breath almost deafening. he is desperate. the violence of his advance abruptly stops, there is silence. we see in a clearance a posse of patrollers, preparing for a lynching of two young men. solomon's eyes meet theirs. the two men look back at solomon with a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose around their neck. suddenly the bloodhounds start barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of solomon. solomon's whole body shakes with anticipation.}
<C>__{patroller}
<P>__{(aggressively)}
<D>__{boy, where are you going?}
<C>__{solomon}
<P>__{(almost tripping over his words)}
<D>__{to the store, sir, to bartholomew's. i was sent there by mistress epps.}
<A>__{the patroller reaches out for solomon's free pass around his neck, yanking him forward. he looks at it.}
<C>__{patroller}
<D>__{get there and get there quick.}
<A>__{the patroller kicks solomon hard, sending him on his way. solomon walks on, looking one more time at the two young men; again there is a moment of connection. solomon turns. the two men are hoisted up, kicking and spitting, behind his shoulder. solomon finds himself back on the trail walking towards bartholomew's, his face now full of shock and trepidation. he walks, fighting to calm himself down. we move behind him as he continues his journey, a lonely figure.}
