<D>__{i remember there was so much white everywhere. and i felt peace...even though there was war around me. and i felt alive, even though i knew i was dead. intern #1 come on, come on, let's tag these guys and get them out of here.}
<A>__{an intern, clipboard in hand, stands above starks' unmoving body with another intern (2) beside him. intern 1 pulls the rest of the sheet off of starks as the other searches for his dog tags and gently closes his eyes with her hand.}
<D>__{intern #2 [reading from the tags] starks, william. born december 25, intern #1 wait, so how old? intern #2 intern #1 [searching through records] here he is. william starks. born in vermont. he hasn't got a family listed. the naval hospital'll figure out what to do with him.}
<A>__{as the intern puts the tags back down, she meets starks' wide open eyes now filled with surfacing tears, sadness, and life. she stares at them curiously and, after some seconds, starks blinks and a tear runs down his cheek jarring her.}
<D>__{intern #2 [calling out] oh my god! this soldier is alive! code blue! code blue! this man just blinked! intern #1 he's been tagged already. worry about the others... [then seeing starks blink] oh shit! shit! code blue! we need a doctor! get a doctor over here now!}
<A>__{as the medical staff rush over to starks, preparing needles and oxygen masks, starks merely closes his eyes and we follow the now bloodied white sheet as it falls to the ground...}
