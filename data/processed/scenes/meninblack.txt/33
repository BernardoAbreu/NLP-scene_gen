<L>__{interior mib building shooting gallery day}
<A>__{seven weapons rest on a table in the middle of an otherwise empty, triangular room. the seven recruits stand in front of the table. there's an odd moment where everyone sort of looks around: at each other, at the blank walls...}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{anyone, uh...any of you guys know what we're doing here?}
<C>__{marine}
<P>__{(clipped, unquestioning)}
<D>__{looking for the best of the best of the best.}
<C>__{edwards}
<P>__{(can't help but smile)}
<D>__{well, yeah, i know, but...}
<A>__{and then .. suddenly the two far walls pull apart. the whole room pulsates and the air is suddenly filled with a bewildering swirl of stroboscopic images, both human and alien. everywhere is color, light and movement a holographic mass of strange shapes and characters moving simultaneously. the recruits lunge for the weapons, snapping them up and taking aim. six shots are fired at once. and then, a second later, a seventh shot is fired. everyone sort of looks at edwards, who puts his gun down last. there's an awkward silence. then the door opens. light pours in, and zed with it. even the highly competitive cadets can't help but feel some sympathy as zed walks straight to edwards.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{the hell happened?}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{hesitated, sir.}
<A>__{zed looks into the gallery. most obvious in the frozen tableau of creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in its chest. next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it. in the back corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty eight year old girl.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{may i ask why you felt little tiffany deserved to die?}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{she was the only one who actually seemed dangerous. at the time.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{and how did you come to that conclusion?}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{hook head guy. you explain to me how he can think with a hook for a head. answer; it's not his head. his head is that butt ugly bean bag thing over there. 'cause if you look at the snarling beast guy, he's not snarling, he's sneezing he's got tissues in his hand. no threat there, and anyhow, the girl's books were way too advanced for an eight year old's. and besides, from where i'm looking, she was the only one who appeared to have a motive. and i don't appreciate your jumping down my throat about it.}
<A>__{sideways glances from the other recruits. zed sighs.}
<C>__{edwards }
<D>__{or, uh do i owe her an apology?}
