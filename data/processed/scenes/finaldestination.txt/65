<A>__{a soft summer breeze passes through the leaves on a tree. a yellow leaf drops from the branch and flutters to the ground. camera follows until it falls upon an old cracked sidewalk. a pair of worn nikes enter frame just as the leaf drops before them. the feet and camera hold until craning up to reveal alex, staring at the leaf with an expression reminiscent of the torn paper's message about "...tod."}

<D>__{almost autumn.}
<A>__{alex looks off toward a small unkept house, nestled at the edge of the woods. in the open garage stands clear rivers amongst cluttered artwork, supplies and tools. her t shirt's sleeves have been cut off and neck line cut low. her jeans have a revealing hole at the spot which once was a back pocket. she wears heavy black work shoes. a dog rests nearby on the floor.}

<D>__{yeah, but everthing's always in transition. if you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel autumn coming.}

<D>__{almost like bein' able... to see the future.}
<A>__{alex reads her intention loud and clear. she returns to her artwork. the dog growls softly as alex appraches the garage.}
