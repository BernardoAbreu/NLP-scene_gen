<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(to adam)}
<D>__{now watch what i do with his wrist. i twist it away while i put on the second cuff. that way he can't go after me. he doesn't have any leverage.}

<C>__{loop}
<D>__{nothing. i'm out of it. merry christmas, guys. good to meet you.}

<C>__{zack}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{great. well, hey. a pleasure.}
