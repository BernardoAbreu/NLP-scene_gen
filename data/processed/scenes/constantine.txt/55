<A>__{a pickup truck crosses a barren landscape. in the back bed are several goats and one prisoner. he grips the relic tight in one hand. that anxious fever has returned. glazed eyes dart to the side and lock on a rising jetliner in the distance dart back to the road they're on heading the opposite way. prisoner clamps his eyes tight, grips to the relic tighter. eyes snap open and he turns, thrusts his elbow through the center window, leans in and grabs the driver jerks his head back against the bulkhead cracking it in the process. prisoner latches onto the wheel, takes control. he swerves the car off the pavement, gets out and takes over as driver. truck continues on, bouncing through a shallow ditch and into the field beyond, aiming straight for the rising airliners in the distance.}
