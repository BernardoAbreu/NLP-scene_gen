<L>__{interior green room late afternoon}
<A>__{the parents, in the same variety of skin colors as the child actors, are stuffed into a small room being patronized by the assistant director. matt is grimly seated in the middle of a long sofa containing stage mothers. another sofa is two feet away; the parents strain at each other. the a.d. is talking grandly but we cannot hear his words because the rainbow parents are singing a phrase from the same song we heard in the make up room. matt does not take part in the singing. the music goes under allowing us to now hear the a.d.'s words.}
<C>__{a.d.}
<D>__{...and when you're in the audience, make sure you laugh and applaud even when it's somebody else's kid...}
<A>__{there is appreciative laughter from everyone save matt, who rises in disgust and crosses out of the room.}

<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{you're not allowed near the stage. we only have a few minutes...}
<A>__{matt ignores him and exits.}
