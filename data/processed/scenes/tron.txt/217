<A>__{flynn still at the door. suddenly his hand goes right through the door.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{the door is disappearing, dissolving.}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(continuing; turning)}
<D>__{look, the door's almost...}
<A>__{he stops in horror.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{yori is standing lethargically staring at her hands... through them. she is de rezzing too. her whole body becoming transparent. she looks up dimly at flynn, with no expression.}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{flynn races back to her and takes her in his arms roughly, hugging her close, his energy flowing into her. their faces are very close as he stares down, terrified that he is too late to save her. her eyes are half closed.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{yori!}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{just their two faces. flynn bends closer, their lips almost touch. suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity, and color floods back into her. her mouth opens in wonder and she looks up at flynn. he pulls a little away from her, still holding her.}
<C>__{yori}
<P>__{(in awe)}
<D>__{you... you brought me back...? why...? how ... ?}

<D>__{i'm gonna need your help. hey, bit!}
<A>__{he looks around, spots a small glow in one corner of the cell, runs to it and stoops down, cupping the glow in his hands. it wavers. flynn wills his energy back into it, frowning with concentration. suddenly the bit pops into life.}
<C>__{bit}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{let's get outta here.}
<A>__{they head for the door.}
<B>__{the mesa top of the mcp}
<A>__{the prisoners file forward on the path to the mcp. sark is leading them. we can see the structure of the mcp closer now, looming bigger. the four memory guards are standing at regular intervals along the path.}
