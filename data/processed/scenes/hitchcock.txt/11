<L>__{interior hitchcock's office, paramount day}
<A>__{luxurious, wood paneled and very british. hitch sits restlessly behind his desk, receiving his morning shave from his private barber, silvio. his longtime assistant, peggy robertson, 40s, crisp, british, fiercely protective of her boss, is going through a list of potential projects.}

<A>__{silvio unintentionally nicks hitch's face.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{a nice, clean, nasty little piece of work.}
<A>__{silvio hurriedly dabs away a speck of blood.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{i will see what i can find.}
<A>__{hitch motions for the barber to hold up the mirror. the image of his face overflows the small frame. repulsed, he leans back his head and makes a hand motion for silvio to slit his}
