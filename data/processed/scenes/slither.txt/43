<L>__{interior grant bedroom night}
<A>__{grant sees starla sitting on the edge of the bed, her back to him, as she puts on her nylons. she doesn't know he's there. grant stares at her, demented, and moves slowly toward her, stalking her. something starts to push grant's shirt up at his stomach, like a bellybutton erection. the thing slips out of his shirt a writhing, pointy tubule, aiming toward starla's back. grant looks at the nape of starla's neck. her delicate ear. he becomes confused; he softens. starla turns to see grant, his body now turned away from her. he's trying to push the tubule back down.}

<D>__{you're pretty.}
