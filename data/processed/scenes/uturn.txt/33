<A>__{bobby walks a bit going nowhere in particular. looking at his watch thinking of mr. arkady, he shields himself with one hand from the sun. at the side of an old building, in the bit of shade it throws, he twists at the beer cap which sticks and won't turn. bobby tries again twisting harder too hard as the cap jerkily twists off, cutting into his hand as it rotates. bobby yells in pain. at the same time the beer comes foaming from the bottle and spills onto his sleeve. the bottle slips from his wet fingers and crashes on the ground, emptying. he clutches his bleeding hand, pissed.}

<D>__{get me outta here, please. i gotta get out of this place.}
<A>__{as if in answer, a jeep drives by on the main street. grace looks pretty hot up there in the driver's seat, her eyes, behind sunglasses, flicking over him but not acknowledging him as she keeps going. bobby's eyes throw back his own hostility at her, but unfortunately she misses it, as he now notices across the street a well kept building with the most modern decor and signage, reading "mckenna's realty co." he thinks about it, in a quandary.}
