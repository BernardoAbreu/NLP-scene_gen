<A>__{once inside the room, and for the first time, precious' soft face looks like stone. mary looks up with a brief but quickly fading smile that is pathetic, apologetic and grim. precious waits. the air is thick without a single word between them. finally, mary looks down.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{your daddy dead.}
<A>__{precious looks surprised for a moment but still composed. mary waits for a response.}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{...is that all?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{carl ...carl had that aids virus.}
<A>__{a previously unseen woman sitting across the room looks up from behind a newspaper. precious stays stone faced until she finally gasps as the aftershock of the revelation hits her squarely. the man across the room collects his hat and coat and leaves. insert glimpses of carl removing his belt, carl thrusting on top of precious, precious following abdul taking early steps. we return to the dayroom as precious opens her eyes and lifts them to mary slowly.}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{... you got it?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{got what?}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{the aids virus.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{how you know?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we never did, you know...}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{no, i don't know mama.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we never did what you got to do to get it.}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{he never been wif you?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yeah...but not like faggots, in the ass and all, so i know.}
<A>__{precious is speechless. it looks as if some of her anger has suddenly been displaced with pity. precious sighs.}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{you better go to the doctor ma.}
<A>__{mary looks up delicately.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you welcome back home.}
<C>__{precious}
<D>__{i'm home here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i better go see 'bout abdul and do homework.}
<A>__{mary doesn't move as precious leaves. mary sits staring at the floor at the far side of the room.}
