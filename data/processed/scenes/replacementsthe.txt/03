<A>__{we're buzzing around the harbor with shane in an old zodiac inflatable dinghy. shane has pulled up the attached rubber hood to his wet suit so that only the white, pasty oblong of his face is visible. it's still raining as he steers the little boat around the sailboats and yachts. he pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and cuts the engine. with practiced moves, he ties the dinghy to the rear rail of the sailboat and clips a bill for services rendered on the sailboat's stern line. he slips on a weight belt, puts on a pair of old gaffer taped goggles, jams the end of a air hose in his mouth, and falls backward out of the dinghy and into the water.}
