<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{inside glass solarium. a swimming pool lies at the center. there is no water in it. framing the pool is a flagstone walk with marble benches spotted here and there. the great glass room had once been planted thickly with tropical foliage. but now what palms and lianas remain are withered and dead with lack of care. at the edge of the pool, near the deep end, a blanket has been spread and a candelabra burns upon it. in its mysterious light our three kids are revealed: jim, bouncing precariously at the end of the diving board; judy on the blanket nearby; plato on the pool's bottom. all three are laughing hysterically when suddenly jim starts to lose his balance.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{quick! fill the pool!}
<A>__{jim falls in. plato rushes to him.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{let's see how long we can stay under.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{man, you're schizoid!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(in another outburst of laughing)}
<D>__{i'm what? what?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{you can't talk underwater!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(gargling)}
<D>__{i bet you hear everything i say!}
<C>__{plato}
<P>__{(gargling)}
<D>__{isn't he schizoid?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(gargling)}
<D>__{hey! how 'bout that!}
<A>__{they laugh again. jim swings up the ladder and goes to judy. plato follows.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{haven't you noticed your personality splitting?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{not lately.}
<A>__{they all sit on the blanket.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{how do you know so much about this junk, plato?}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{i had to go to a head shrinker. i only went twice though. my mother said it cost too much, so she went to hawaii instead.}
<A>__{jim lies back with his head in judy's lap. she strokes his hair and smiles at him. plato looks away.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no. seriously. what's your trouble?}
<A>__{plato hesitates a moment, then leans back, cuddling between the two of them.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{i don't know but whatever it is, it's gone now. i mean i'm happy now. here.}
<A>__{jim puts his arm under plato's chin.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{i came here before.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{when was that?}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{when i was here? when i ran away. i used to run away a lot but they always took me back.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{mom and dad. i used to be in my crib and i'd listen to them fight.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you remember that far back? boy, i can't even remember yesterday.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{plato, where's your father now?}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{he's dead. he was a hero in the china sea.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you told me he's a big wheel in new york!}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{i did? well, he might as well be dead. what's the difference?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{it's all right.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{plato closes his eyes. judy hums a lullaby as she strokes jim's lips with a finger. he snaps at it. then he kisses her hand, looks at her palm. they whisper.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you have a long life line.}
<A>__{she takes his palm and examines it.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{so have you.}
<A>__{she kisses it, holds her cheek against it.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{ever been in a place like this before?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{not exactly. it's certainly huge.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{how many rooms do you think there are?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{should we explore?}
<A>__{she looks at plato. jim shrugs tests to see if the boy is awake, but there is no reaction. carefully, they crawl to their feet. jim supporting plato's head with his hands as they do so. jim takes the other blanket and covers plato with it. judy kneels on the other side and tucks it in. they look at each other across him and smile. then suddenly judy bends down and kisses plato's cheek very softly. judy and jim rise. jim takes a candle from the candelabra and leads judy along the edge of the pool to the glass doors beyond. silence except for their footfalls on the flagstone. in the distance we see the doors open and the couple pass through. when they close again, a sob comes from plato. high angle closeup. plato lying as they left him, but his eyes are open and he is crying. camera booms up as plato throws off the blanket and looks after them. camera booms higher until he is revealed as a small and lonely figure sitting by himself. the pool echoes his weeping.}
