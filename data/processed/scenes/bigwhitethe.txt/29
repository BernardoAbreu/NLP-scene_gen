<L>__{interior "barnell great escapes travel" morning}
<A>__{paul tries to open the front door, but finds it blocked by a small pile of snow. three good yanks and it finally opens. he enters the shop. faded travel posters cover the walls. avis (40s), a career office gal, smiles at her boss as she assembles a life size stand up cardboard display for aloha airlines. it features a dark hawaiian beauty holding a softball sized sea shell. the shell juts out of the display giving it a 3 d quality.}
<C>__{avis}
<D>__{morning mr. barnell. coffee?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{thanks avis. looks good.}
<A>__{paul, shivering, hangs up his coat as avis picks up a promotional aloha air surfboard (the old display) and walks it to the back.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{was november this bad last year?}
<C>__{avis }
<D>__{well if we didn't have the weather what would we talk about? did you send the computer back?}
<A>__{paul moves to his desk.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah, it was not working. any calls?}
<C>__{avis }
<D>__{just that fellow from municipal power and electric. i told him you sent the check in weeks ago, but some people don't like to listen.}
<A>__{paul turns to look at the snow covered empty parking lot, then at a photo of his wife margaret on his desk. he mentally gathers himself.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{something... strange happened last night avis.}
<C>__{avis }
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{did... you ever meet my brother raymond?}
<C>__{avis }
<D>__{the one who went missing?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{uh huh. well anyway last night there's a knock on the door and there's raymond, just... standing there on the doorstep.}
<A>__{avis arrives with the coffee and the mail.}
<C>__{avis}
<D>__{didn't you have him declared...?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{dead? no. i mean, they said he hadn't been gone long enough.}
<C>__{avis}
<P>__{(smiling warmly)}
<D>__{good thing in hindsight.}
<A>__{paul puts the mail down on the desk and start to flip through it. lots of bills, most marked past due. he finds a "pre approved" credit card application, sets it to one side.}
<C>__{avis }
<D>__{so where was he all these years?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{lower 48. said he wanted to get away from the cold.}
<C>__{avis}

<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{sorry, what was that?}
<C>__{avis}
<D>__{where was he living?}
<A>__{paul, a flash of panic, looks over at the hawaii display. he keys on the shell.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{florida.}
<C>__{avis}
<D>__{i've got an aunt down there. where 'bouts?}
<C>__{paul}

<C>__{avis}
<D>__{well that's great. you and mrs. barnell will have some company for a bit i guess. how is she?}
<C>__{paul}
