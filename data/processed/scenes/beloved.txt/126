<A>__{sethe is asleep. paul is restless tossing and turning as we intercut; dream images flashing across his mind... rain pouring down a trench. a muddy pool forming around a black man's feet. iron chains fed into metal ankle cuffs. paul d. on his knees before a white guard crotch.}

<D>__{i will make some breakfast you get yourself washed up.}
<A>__{sethe begins to make breakfast as beloved enters the kitchen and sees paul has slept in the rocker. she looks at him with a smile, as if she knows more than she's letting on. paul registers the look.}
