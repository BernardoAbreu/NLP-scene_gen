<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{the two police officers who start to move the crowd and show on.}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{alright, i think it's time to move on, folks.}
<A>__{but on spotting the naked valentina who winks at them, they agree between themselves to give the show a bit longer.}
<L>__{int ext imaginarium}
<A>__{tony and the louis vuitton woman are astonished to find themselves in the romantic, soft focus, pastel colour setting of a soothing, sophisticated, shampoo commercial. soft fabrics waft, cleansing waterfalls cascade, rose petals float through the air, beautiful girls swing from swings attached to clouds all in delicious slow motion.}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman}
<P>__{(overcome)}
<D>__{oh... how gorgeous...}
<A>__{the louis vuitton woman takes tony's hand and looks at him meaningfully. tony, disorientated, takes a moment to regain his composure. he smiles and, with an effort, puts his arm around the louis vuitton woman's wide waist. he looks into her eyes. she's in love.}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman }
<P>__{(moans softly)}
<D>__{ohhh... what bliss... and i don't even know your name...}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{tony...}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman}
<D>__{tony. how dashing.}
<A>__{a bar or two of tango encourages them to take a couple of intimate tango dance steps. now gently wafting curtains part to reveal.. down a flower strewn path and over a bridge... a sleazy motel with a shingle over the door reads: "the one night stand motel". in the office window sits mr. nick}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman }
<D>__{oh, goodness me!}
<A>__{she bats her eyelashes at tony and begins, knowingly, to pull him towards the motel.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(resisting)}
<D>__{if i'm not wrong, i fear you must go alone.}
<A>__{the louis vuitton woman pouts playfully, pulling him onwards.}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman}
<D>__{why would i want to go without you darling?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{it's one of the rules... one imagination at a time, free from the influence of another.}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman}
<P>__{(petulant)}
<D>__{boring.}
<A>__{they have reached the bridge. stairs descend to a stream.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{oh..look... another possibility..}
<A>__{below them a gondola rests in the stream as small, flower bedecked barques float past with framed pictures of romantic heroes who died young; keats, shelly, byron, james dean, rudolph valentino, marilyn monroe, buddy holly, princess diana... the stream continues off into the distance to a dark, towering egyptian pyramid. tony is as bemused as the louis vuitton woman.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{you must make a choice...and... actually, to be honest, i'd strongly recommend this one.}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman}
<D>__{but... rudolph valentino, james dean, princess di?... all these people... they're dead.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(thinking fast)}
<D>__{exactly. to be reborn, first you must die. all of them have achieved a kind of immortality. and we love them all the more for it. they won't get old or fat. they won't get sick or feeble. they are beyond fear. they are forever young. they are gods. and you can join them.}
<C>__{louis vuitton woman}
<P>__{(softening)}
<D>__{you're such a wonderful speaker.}
<A>__{the gondola awaits....with a beautiful male model at the helm. the louis vuitton woman smiles at him.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{there's not a moment to lose.}
<A>__{but as she hesitates a dark shadow rises over them. tony, looking past the woman"s shoulder, sees the dark waters of the stream rise up transforming into a gigantic king cobra that towers menacingly over them. it's wearing a bowler hat... and it's angry.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{but your sacrifice must be pure. you have to let go of all these worldly goods.}
<A>__{he helps the louis vuitton woman remove her necklace, earrings, bracelets, rings, broach, in double quick time and guides her onto the gondola, blowing a kiss after her.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{remember nothing is permanent... not even death.}
<A>__{he turns back to see the gigantic king cobra shrinking back below the bridge, transforming itself back into the waters of the stream. from under the arch of the bridge hangs a rope. at its end.. a hangman's noose. tony stares at it darkly disconcerted.}
