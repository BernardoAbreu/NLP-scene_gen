<C>__{mcmurphy}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{who do you like in the opening game, sam?}
<C>__{washington }
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<P>__{(turning away)}
<D>__{asshole.}
<A>__{mcmurphy turns and walks away. washington watches him go.}
<C>__{cheswick }
<D>__{i wanna know about my cigarettes!}
<L>__{interior day room day}
<A>__{a group meeting is in progress. doctor spivey is there. cheswick is on his feet.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{sit down, mister cheswick.}
<C>__{cheswtck}
<P>__{(not sitting)}
<D>__{no, i ain't no kid to have my cigarettes keep from me like cookies! ain't that right, mack!}
<P>__{(mcmurphy doesn't respond)}
<D>__{mack???}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{sit down, mister cheswick!}
<A>__{cheswick sits stunned. a beat; then:}
<C>__{big nurse }
<P>__{(to cheswick)}
<D>__{you should have thought about that before you gambled all your cigarettes away. is that clear?}
<A>__{cheswick sulks in his seat.}
<C>__{big nurse }
<D>__{mister cheswick, is that clear!}
<C>__{cheswick}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{good...}
<P>__{(opens her book)}
<D>__{now, as i recall, we were making quite a bit of headway, last time, with mister harding's problem. so, does anyone care to begin?}
<A>__{mcmurphy's hand goes up. no one else's does.}
<C>__{big nurse }
<D>__{yes, mister mcmurphy.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{right... i've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' i got a few things i wanna get off my chest, before we get back to harding's problem.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{certainly, mister mcmurphy.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{right!}
<A>__{mcmurphy takes a folded sheet of paper out of his pocket, unfolds it, studies it and begins.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{'kay... item one... i've been thinkin' 'bout the age problem we got on this ward. you know, the young an' old livin' together, an' i was thinkin' what a great thing it would be if the music was turned up louder. louder so the old fellas could hear better...}
<A>__{doctor spivey nods with approval. big nurse doesn't. the acutes are bewildered.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{but then i got to thinkin', the music is so loud already, it makes it difficult for the young fellas to hold a decent conversation...}
<A>__{nods and murmurs of approval from the acutes. big nurse can only wait for mcmurphy's next move.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{well, i was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when i happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' i said to myself, mcmurphy, i said, that place would make a great second day room. a sort of game room for the young fellas. whadaya think, doc?}
<C>__{spivey}
<D>__{it is worth considering... miss ratched?}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{the point is well taken, doctor, but do we have the necessary personnel to cover a second day room?}
<C>__{spivey}
<D>__{well, since it will be largely the chronics who remain here, one aide and one nurse should easily be able to handle any situation that might occur.}
<P>__{(he turns to the patients)}
<D>__{what do you think, men, is it workable?}
<C>__{cheswick}
<D>__{right, doc. it's workable.}
<A>__{several other acutes voice in the affirmative.}
<C>__{spivey}
<D>__{fine!}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{good. good. yes, yes, i think we should give it a trial period. so! may we get back to mister harding's problem...}
<P>__{(she sees mcmurphy's hand up)}
<D>__{yes, mister mcmurphy?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{i'm not finished yet.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{go on...}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<P>__{(looking at his list)}
<D>__{'kay, item two. tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding a lings. tomorrow is the opening game of the world series an' what i want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{just a minute, mister mcmurphy!}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{the hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. what i want is a vote on it right now!}
<C>__{cheswick}
<D>__{i second the motion!}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{atta boy, cheswick!}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{very well! all those in favor, please raise your hands.}
<A>__{big nurse casts a watchful eye over the patients.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<P>__{(raising his hand)}
<D>__{okay, raise your hands.}
<A>__{only cheswick's goes up.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{come on', what is this crap? who wants to watch the world series?}
<A>__{martini and scanlon's hands go up. several acutes look at them. scanlon and martini's hands go down. mcmurphy can't believe his eyes.}
<C>__{big nurse }
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{i count only two, including you, mister mcmurphy. certainly not enough to change ward policy.}
<A>__{mcmurphy's hand goes down.}
<C>__{big nurse }
<D>__{yes. now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, mister mcmurphy?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{cheswick}
<D>__{no way.}
<A>__{mcmurphy starts tearing his sheet of paper up into a thousand pieces.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<P>__{(checking her watch)}
<D>__{then i suggest we turn our attention back to mister harding's problem. would anybody care to begin?}
<A>__{she looks around. mcmurphy is slouched in his chair. harding puts his hands up. no one else does.}
<C>__{big nurse }
<D>__{yes, mister harding?}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{yes, thank you, miss ratched. since our last meeting i have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. naturally, i'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... no, no. to personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...}
<P>__{(he stops, chews his lip, then continues)}
<D>__{regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... yes. yes. the question of... existence... relationship... function... confront... yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... yes, the crisis of our souls. of our souls, which i am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...}
<A>__{harding, breaks off, sweating; he begins to knead his forehead and chew his nails.}
<C>__{harding }
<D>__{to reflect...}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{silence as the camera reflects: the room, the patients, the staff, the hallways, the hospital, the grounds, the trees, the sky, ending on.}
<C>__{martini }
<D>__{hold it a minute. what's a man need to buy thum hotels?}
