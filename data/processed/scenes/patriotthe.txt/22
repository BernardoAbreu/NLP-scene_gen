<D>__{look! there's gabriel!}
<A>__{they see gabriel making his way through the crowd. he sees them and waves, then enters the house. a moment later charlotte steps out onto the balcony and sees: in the square, a pair of drunk sons of liberty, pull down one of the smoldering effigies, cut off its head, then start hacking at it's groin with a sword. appalled, charlotte shoots a glare at marion and snaps at the children.}
