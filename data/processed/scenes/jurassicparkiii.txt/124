<A>__{grant chases after us, catching a rung just as it goes over the water. behind him, pteranodons are circling the wreckage of the first chopper and starting to go after the second. buffeted by the wind, grant climbs the ladder up towards the chopper. a pteranodon flies up right behind him, trying to bite. it catches grant's shoulder. grant spins to the far side of the ladder. the pteranodon goes to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs. as it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled. the entire ladder starts to lift, caught by the updraft from the creatures wings.}
