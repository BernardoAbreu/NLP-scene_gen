<L>__{interior spicer's room night}
<A>__{tita and spicer. though both are clothed, they are caught in some stage of intimacy on top of spicer's bed. tita sits up immediately, mortally embarrassed, as bobby steps into the room.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{tita, what the hell are you doing?!}
<A>__{spicer stands up.}
<C>__{spicer}
<D>__{hey, this is my room.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(moving over to the bed)}
<D>__{what's going on here!?}

<D>__{it's none of your business!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{where's catherine?!}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{i don't know where she is!}
<A>__{spicer moves to bobby, taking hold of his arm.}
<C>__{spicer}
<D>__{don't you believe in knocking, pal?}
<A>__{bobby roughly pushes him away and advances on tita.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm talking to you, tita!}
<C>__{tita}
<P>__{(close to tears)}
<D>__{can't i have anything to myself, dammit?!}
<C>__{spicer}
<P>__{(grabbing hold of him again)}
<D>__{come on now, out!}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(struggling with him)}
<D>__{keep your fucking hands off my sister, nurse!}
<A>__{spicer goes into sudden rage, pushing bobby violently toward the door and yelling:}
<C>__{spicer}
<D>__{did you hear me! move out!!}
<A>__{bobby leaps at him and as their struggle carries them into the kitchen, tita begins yelling:}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{stop it! bobby, will just you stop! i mean it!}
<A>__{spicer gets bobby into a painful headlock and is being bulled around the kitchen by him.}

<A>__{they crash into the kitchen table, knocking chairs over.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{carl! somebody get carl!}
<A>__{bobby rams spicer into the refrigerator.}
<C>__{spicer}
<D>__{take it easy, dammit!}
<A>__{he hurls him against the kitchen wall, still holding him in a headlock as tita enters the kitchen.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{stop it! right now! just stop it!! carl!!}
<A>__{and as she runs from the room, spicer begins violently jerking his forearm up against bobby's trachea, punctuating each jerk with the repeated command:}
<C>__{spicer}
<D>__{give up! give up! give up! give up! give up! give up!}
<A>__{he feels bobby's body slacken. he releases him and bobby drops to the floor as... ... carl, catherine and tita run into the kitchen, looking to: bobby, gasping for air, tries to get up from the floor, and unable to, slumps back against the kitchen wall.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{oh god, bobby, look what you've done...}
<A>__{he looks past her, to catherine.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i just wanted to talk to you for a minute.}
