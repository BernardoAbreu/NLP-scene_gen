<A>__{hector fumbles awkwardly with his bag and then walks off down the track. he turns to look at beatrice. she stands outside her house for a long time, watching him until he turns onto the main road and out of sight. the pain and the awkwardness in beatrice and hector are specific, but the scene of parting is timeless. is this the ten millionth such parting, or the billionth? it is one of them at any rate, and a sad one.}
