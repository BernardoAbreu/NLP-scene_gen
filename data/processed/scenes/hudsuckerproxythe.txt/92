<C>__{moses}
<D>__{strictly speakin', i'm never spozed to do this but... have you got a better idea?}
<B>__{norville}
<A>__{twisting back to look up over his shoulder; there is a distant very distant singing.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{looking up the length of the hudsucker building. someone or something wrapped in white is flying toward us, coming down from the stars. we can make out a male voice, accompanied by strumming:}
<C>__{voice }

<B>__{norville}
<A>__{he gapes.}
<B>__{angel}
<A>__{ for it is an angel, arrives. he is a balding man, wearing rimless glasses, in a white robe, large feathery wings sprouting from his back and beating heavily until he comes to rest, in midair. he puts aside the harp he has been strumming on a nearby windowsill.}

<C>__{hudsucker }
<D>__{ta daaaa!}
<A>__{presenting himself, he spreads his arms and stamps his forward foot, forgetting that there is nothing beneath his foot to stamp. he lurches forward, momentarily losing his balance.}

<C>__{norville}
<D>__{'many years, uh... i know that you will be wondering why i have decided to move on, ending my tenure at hudsucker, and here on earth. you will be thinking, why now, when things are going so well? granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. however, sid. these things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. i look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. now i see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' how has this come to pass? when and why did i trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? what the heck have i done?}
<A>__{as norville reads hudsucker casually examines his fingernails, then pats down a yawn.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{'...looking back now, sid, i see that i allowed time and age to corrupt my dreams. instead of fiercely guarding what was timeless inside of myself, i let the hubbub of earthly commerce erode my character, and dissolve my better self. how is it that some manage to preserve themselves where i have failed? sidney, i do not know. perhaps if others love you, you may more securely love yourself but i am alone. i loved a woman once, sid, as you well know a beautiful, vibrant lady, an angel who in her wisdom saw fit to choose you instead of i...'}
<A>__{norville is interrupted by loud blubbering. he looks up. hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief. he saws at his nose, gives it a loud honk, and urgently quavers in a voice strangled with emotion:}
