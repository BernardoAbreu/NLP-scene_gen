<L>__{interior elektra's bedroom sunset}
<A>__{bond enters. elektra is standing by the window watching the golden ball of the sun sink into the sea. she wears nothing but a silk embroidered robe; the sun shows through it, outlining her naked body in soft, shadowy curves.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<A>__{he nods. he is wound tight, she senses it.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i can't stay.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{i need to ask you something. and i need you to tell me the truth.}
<A>__{he waits.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{who is it? who is trying to kill me?}
<A>__{bond looks at her; vulnerable, fragile, trying to be strong. he cannot tell her the truth.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i don't know. but i will find him.}
<A>__{she stares at him, sensing he is withholding something. she turns back to the window. he approaches behind her.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{after the kidnapping...i was afraid to go outside, to be alone, to be in a crowd, to do anything at all, until i realized...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{there's no point in living if you can't...feel alive.}
<A>__{she looks out at the fading sun.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{i can't huddle in the shadows. i can't let fear run my life. i won't.}
<A>__{she turns to him.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{the way i acted, in the snow...you must think i'm a coward.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i think you're one of the bravest people i've ever met.}
<A>__{she looks up at him, into his eyes; they are so close. all she has to do is tilt her mouth upward...she kisses him. his hands come up across her back, pressing her toward him, her body melting into his, and then... he pulls back. has to physically step away from her.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{...you should rest.}
<A>__{that was exactly the wrong thing to say. he sees the rebellion flair in her eyes.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{james...}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i have to go.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{then take me with you.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{no. you'll be safe here.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{i don't want to be safe!}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i have to go to work.}
<A>__{he starts toward the door.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{now who's the coward?}
<A>__{he stops, his back up...then heads out the door.}
<B>__{in the hallway}
<A>__{he passes gabor, standing faithfully outside.}
