<A>__{leonard stumbles in, naked, from the bathroom, swings around, hitting dodd square in the face with the empty vodka bottle, which does not break. dodd lies still on the floor, bleeding, his hand still in his inside jacket pocket. leonard stands above him, naked, dripping wet, catching his breath. there is a knock at the door.}

<D>__{housekeeping.}
<A>__{the sound of a key entering the lock. leonard leaps for the door and flips the privacy latch.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{not just now!}
<A>__{leonard listens to the maid withdraw her key. leonard searches dodd, finding his gun in his inside pocket. leonard examines the weapon, then starts to search the room. leonard finds an overnight bag at the bottom of the closet. inside it there are some clothes, spare ammunition, a large hunting knife, and a roll of silver electrical tape. leonard wraps the electrical tape around dodd's wrists, then across his mouth. leonard finishes taping up dodd, then sits him on the edge of the bed. leonard takes a polaroid photograph of the bloody, taped up dodd. leonard shoves dodd into the closet, takes out a note and consults it, then writes "dodd" on the white strip on the front of the photograph. he flips the picture over and writes on the strip on the back, in smaller writing: "get rid of him, ask natalie" leonard dresses, puts the polaroid into the inside pocket of his jacket. he looks again at the note. it says: "dodd, mountcrest inn on 5th street, room 6" "put him onto teddy or just get rid of him for natalie" leonard picks the stack of polaroids out of his outside jacket pocket. he flips through them until he finds the one of teddy, then picks up the phone and dials teddy's number. the phone is answered: memento pink revisions 9 7 99}
