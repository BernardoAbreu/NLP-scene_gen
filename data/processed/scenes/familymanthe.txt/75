<L>__{interior big eds tires, jacks office late afternoon}
<A>__{jack is behind his desk, his tie loosened, on the phone...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{...i have no idea what our inventory level is, thats why im asking you...}
<A>__{a knock at the door...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{look, just send us what you sent us last month, okay...? and keep doing that until further notice...}
<A>__{he hangs up the phone as the door opens. big ed sticks his head in...}
<C>__{big ed}
<D>__{got a minute, jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ive got all the time in the world...}
<A>__{big ed walks in, followed by sydney potter, 60s, a tough looking man...}
<C>__{big ed}
<D>__{jack, meet sydney potter, buyrite transport, one of jerseys top businessmen...}
<A>__{potter extends a hand, jack rises from his chair, trying to place the name. then...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{...and a helluva bridge player. eds told me a lot about you...}
<A>__{they shake hands. potter nods his head at jack, immediately impressed. big ed is beaming.}
<C>__{potter}
<P>__{(in a heavy jersey accent)}
<D>__{lucky in cards, lucky in business, lucky in love. my cup runneth over...}
<P>__{(to big ed)}
<D>__{hes a nice looking boy...}
<C>__{big ed}
<D>__{my daughters no slouch either...}
<A>__{a smile from potter, then a serious look.}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{lets cut to the chase, jack. big ed tells me youre the grease that makes the wheels turn around here. i need a new parts supplier for my fleet. you seem to have the parts. that we know. what we dont know is why the hell i should buy them from you.}
<A>__{potter stares jack down. but jacks not about to be intimidated by him. he pauses, matching potters stare. then...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i have no idea...}
<A>__{a surprised look from potter. an anxious laugh from big ed.}
<C>__{big ed}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{cmon jack...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to potter)}
<D>__{i mean it. from what i can tell, were a mom and pop operation, were already over extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...}
<A>__{jack continues to stare down potter.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{so like i said, i dont have any idea why you should buy your parts from us...}
<A>__{the staring match continues. big eds getting more nervous. potters the first to blink.}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{okay, you got my attention...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{except for rule number one...}
<A>__{jack smiles.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{the customer is always right. a cliche? sure. the difference is, we mean it. were small, we need our customers. we cant afford to disappoint them, ever. yeah, you could go to some leviathan supplier, probably save a few pennies on the price of oil filters, but with us you get more than a supplier, you get a bridge partner...}
<A>__{a smile from potter. jack gives ed a wink. ed watches, thrilled...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{you want to bid hearts, were right there with you. you feel the need to redouble, youre not going to get any argument from us...}
<A>__{potter nods at jack. jack moves in for the kill.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{the big guys may have the high cards, but you know as well as i do, sydney, high cards dont always take the trick.}
<A>__{potter pauses a minute, then...}
<C>__{potter}
<P>__{(to big ed, re: jack)}
<D>__{i like him...}
<A>__{big ed smiles, letting out a relieved sigh.}
<C>__{big ed}
<P>__{(a wink to jack)}
<D>__{thats my boy...}
<P>__{(an arm around potter)}
<D>__{cmon, lemme show you the rest of the ranch...}
<A>__{big ed and potter exit the office...}
<C>__{big ed }
<P>__{(turning back to jack)}
<D>__{nice shootin, jack...}
<A>__{...leaving jack there with a satisfied smile on his face.}
