<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{he won't.}
<A>__{kelvin enters, with rheya. snow and sartorius exchange glances.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{this is my wife, rheya.}

<C>__{kelvin}

<A>__{sartorius begins.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{i suggest we pool our knowledge regarding the... visitors. we can express whatever questions or conclusions we might have... share information about our various... experiments. agreed?}
<A>__{kelvin and snow nod.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{i would like to start with motivation. why are they here?}
<A>__{sartorius looks at rheya. she looks away.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{they are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. they are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{it's an experiment.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{no. there's no behavior modification.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{she reappeared exactly as she had before?}
<A>__{kelvin looks at rheya and nods. she is struck by the word "before".}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{the same vulnerabilities?}
<A>__{he nods again.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{a recoil, with no compensating mechanism.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{and when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{followed by non human manifestations.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{are the actions of solaris premeditated?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{is it being deliberately cruel, you mean? i don't think so.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{i'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<P>__{(to rheya)}
<D>__{when you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{if they're not learning anything and they're not modifying their behavior, why do they come back?}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{it's like they're plugged into a game, which goes around and around, endlessly repeating itself.}
