<D>__{okay. i will be right in.}
<A>__{sandy goes back inside. suddenly, a big red robin chirps loudly above. jeffrey looks up at it sitting in the cherry tree. the robin and jeffrey seems to exchange a special look. jeffrey smiles up at the fat bird. he gets off the lawn chair and walks away from us toward the back door of the house. as he passes his father and detective williams:}
