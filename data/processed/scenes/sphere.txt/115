<D>__{edmunds? can you copy?}
<A>__{an empty chair. edmunds is not here. we hear a repeating thump. thump.}
<B>__{thump.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{edmunds?}
<A>__{on a monitor we see her body, wedged in a light stand bracket, floating in the water, lifeless. her helmet thumping against the wall of the habitat.}
<L>__{interior underwater outside the habitat}
<A>__{norman and beth, in jumpsuits and helmets, walk out from under the habitat. still hearing the thumping. they pause, looking around.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{coast is clear.}
<A>__{they go to the south end of the habitat. the thumping louder. norman climbs up the grid like stanchion, the support beam holding up the habitat. the body above him flapping in the current. thumping against the wall. he climbs, reaching the body. a boot swings, catches the loop in his air hose. bubbles shoot out.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{norman, your suit it's leaking.}
<A>__{the boot comes off in norman's hand and the naked foot, gray flesh, purple toenails, kicks his faceplate. startles him.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{norman. look at this.}
<A>__{on edmunds' suit a long tear in the fabric, revealing red, mangled flesh. droplets of blood float past norman's faceplate.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{her flesh has been macerated. chewed. i've never seen a bite like this before.}
<A>__{norman pulls her body out. edmunds' faceplate whips around and norman sees her staring eyes, mouth open in horror.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i can't feel her bones. she's like a sponge.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{she was crushed. feel her skin it's like sandpaper.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what could have done this?}
<A>__{we hear a sensor: pong. pong. pong.}
