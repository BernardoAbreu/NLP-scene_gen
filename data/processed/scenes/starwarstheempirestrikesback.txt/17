<L>__{exterior hoth snow drift dusk}
<A>__{luke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious. slowly he looks up and sees ben kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow. it is hard to tell if kenobi is real or a hallucination.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{luke... luke.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{ben?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you will go to the dagobah system.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{dagobah system?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{there you will learn from yoda, the jedi master who instructed me.}
<A>__{the image of ben fades, revealing a lone tauntaun rider approaching from the windswept horizon.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(groaning faintly)}
<D>__{ben... ben.}
<A>__{luke drops into unconsciousness. han pulls up and leaps off his mount. he hurries to his snow covered friend, cradling him in his arms. han's tauntaun lets out a low, pitiful bellow. but han's concern is with luke, and he shakes him urgently.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{luke! luke! don't do this, luke. come on, give me a sign here.}
<A>__{luke doesn't respond. han begins frantically rubbing and slapping luke's unconscious face. as he starts to lift the youth, han hears a rasping sound behind him. he turns, just in time to see his tauntaun stagger and then fall over into the snow. han carries luke to the moaning beast. then, with a final groan, the tauntaun expires.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{not much time.}
<A>__{he pushes luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(moaning)}
<D>__{ben... ben...}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{hang on, kid.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{dagobah system...}
<A>__{han ignites luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe. he quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts luke's inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(reeling from the odor)}
<D>__{whew...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{dagobah...}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{this may smell bad, kid...}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(moaning)}

<C>__{han}
<D>__{...but it will keep you warm... til i get the shelter built.}
<P>__{(struggling to get}
<D>__{luke inside the}
<P>__{carcass)}
<D>__{ooh... i thought they smelled bad on the outside!}
<A>__{the wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move. han removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter container. he begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection against a bitter hoth night.}
