<C>__{percy}
<D>__{come on, motherfuckers! come on!}
<A>__{closer and closer the creatures come. most are eviscerated by the fire from the rooftop.}

<A>__{on charlie staring at the window. closer. charlie's eyes go wide as smash! a dark shape crashes through the window. glass, sand and dust swirl in. audrey and sandra scream. charlie springs up from her hiding place, gun ready. jeep spins around, pointing his gun, searching frantically for the intruder. it's so dark!}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{where is it?!}
<A>__{audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. she looks over at her mother. sandra's eyes are closed. it's too much.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{mom! open your eyes!}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{i can't! i can't!}
<A>__{suddenly howard's body is torn away from sandra. something's got hold of his legs! that gets sandra's eyes open!}
<C>__{sandra}
<P>__{(springing after her husband)}
<D>__{howard!}
<A>__{howard screams deliriously as he's dragged rapidly through the diner toward the broken front window. he flails about, desperately trying to grab a hold of something. sandra scrambles after her husband. reaching for him.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{daddy!}
<A>__{the creature reaches the window. sandra dives for howard's outstretched hands. she has him! the creature's progress is abruptly halted at the shattered window. it turns back toward sandra a shaft of light falling across its face, reveals: a teenage girl of about audrey's age. her skin is a deathly blue. her pupils a ghastly white. deep human fingernail scratches have torn open the bloated flesh on her arms, neck and face. the self inflicted wounds of a drug addict. her voice is not quite human.}
<C>__{teenage girl}
<D>__{see what you made me do, mother!?}
<A>__{sandra screams, holds on.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{charlie and audrey rush to sandra's side, grabbing howard's arms. jeep is right behind them ready to fire at the creature, but with the women in the way, he can't get a clear shot. so he discards the gun and grabs howard's arms. howard screams as his body is torturously stretched. a human tug of war. on howard's feet two more sets of sinewy muscle and bone}
<B>__{claws reach through the window and grab his legs.}
<A>__{howard's body lurches further out the window.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{howard!}
<A>__{howard's torso is almost entirely out the window. charlie daringly reaches for howard's belt, desperate to gain leverage.}
<B>__{another disfigured hand punches through the blinds and locks}
<A>__{onto charlie's arm! charlie screams as she's yanked painfully toward the window, losing her grip on howard's belt. through the broken window, she sees the face of a raggedy looking man. he smiles at her like a father coming home to his baby girl.}
<C>__{raggedy man}
<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{there you are!}
<A>__{and he starts to pull her arm even harder...other creatures suddenly notice her as well, focusing their attack as if she alone was their target. jeep immediately let's go of howard and dives for charlie, grabbing her free arm just before she's pulled through. without the help, audrey and sandra can't hold on any longer. howard is ripped from of his family's hands and out the window.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{daddy!}
