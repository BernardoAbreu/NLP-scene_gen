<L>__{interior mrs. caslon's living room night}
<A>__{it is remarkably neat and elegant inside. as haven, glancing around, pauses inside, he finds himself facing a burly uniformed cavalry officer, captain's bars gleaming on the side of his collar. the captain is big and broad and scowling. he is standing by the fireplace and his eyes are boring into haven's with curiosity and perhaps, suspicion. stellman steps forward as haven and the captain are measuring each other.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{captain iles the commanding officer of the post.}
<A>__{haven gives a casual nod.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{mr. haven sir.}
<A>__{iles looks him up and down. haven hands him an envelope which he slips into his tunic without removing his gaze from haven.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{i see you finally got here.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{i seem to finally get everywhere.}
<A>__{they eye each other, iles scowling, haven thinly smiling. the sense of conflict is already between them.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(introducing)}
<D>__{mrs. caslon, mr. haven.}
<A>__{she nods and smiles warmly.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{you've met mr. stellman.}
<A>__{haven nods.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{it came off beautifully. he picks a very good fight. in fact, i think i'm still a little sore at him.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(grunting)}
<D>__{sit down, mr. haven.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{thank you, captain.}
<A>__{he sits down. iles is still studying haven.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{so you're operating under sealed orders.}
<A>__{haven nods agreeably.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(disgruntled)}
<D>__{all this mumbo jumbo is characteristic of the military information department.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{we use it as sparingly as possible.}
<A>__{iles pulls out a cigar, lights it, sizing haven up.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{i've been in this territory for a number of years and i think it might be a little rougher here than a suburb of washington, d.c.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{very possibly.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{then why is m.i.d. sending you out here?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{because two soldiers have been murdered.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{and they think i can't handle that?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{they merely know you haven't.}
<A>__{there is a tight little silence, while iles formulates his dislike for this newcomer.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{i have only ninety four men on the post, with indian trouble up north. the war department has refused to send reinforcements, or am i boring you?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(looking bored)}
<D>__{i'm not the war department.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(explaining)}
<D>__{the two soldiers were killed while escorting one of the gold stages.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{is escorting gold a function of your command?}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{young man, the functions of my command look very pretty on paper, but they're not very practical in a territory like this. do you have any illusions about that?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i have no illusions about anything.}
<A>__{haven takes out his pipe and fills it.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{what's happening to the gold?}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{i've permitted it to be stored in a warehouse on the post. now everybody is waiting to see what i do nexterior}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{what do you do next?}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(with sarcasm)}
<D>__{aren't you here to tell me?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(lighting the pipe)}
<D>__{captain, you're in a bad way.}
<P>__{(going over to discard the match)}
<D>__{wells fargo won't convoy gold. you tried and failed and two men are dead. the gold is piling up on the post and you can't move it. your post is under manned. you want the quartermaster at platte to replace seventy uniforms sent to the freight office at west rim city }
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{the freight building burned down with the uniforms! i'm not operating a fire department and if i was, west rim city is sixty miles away!}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{that doesn't concern me either.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{what does?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{the killing of two soldiers.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{they were my men, haven, and i'm trying every way i know to find out who murdered them.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{so will i.}
<A>__{for the first time iles looks amicably at him, as though realizing that after all the man isn't there to criticize him.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{you'll find it harder than you think. i don't know how you operate, but it's a dangerous job that can get you killed.}
<A>__{he smiles slightly at iles, who gives him a slight smile in return, somehow intrigued by this nonchalance. haven rises from the chair, lighting the dead pipe in vain.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{perhaps i can get some help from the sheriff.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{you can forget him. he's a miserable man that somebody is using to keep the law a joke.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you make it sound very difficult. why don't you just wrap up your flag and take it back east with you?}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(smarting)}
<D>__{tell me, how will i know what you're doing?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i will let you know from time to time.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{that's very obliging of you.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{but i don't want to visit the army post.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{then report to me through mrs. caslon here. you can be a friend of her husband's. he owned the argus mine and died last year. if that meets your approval.}
<A>__{haven glances at mrs. caslon, smiles back at iles.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{only if it meets with hers.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{i'd be delighted to help.}
<P>__{(she smiles at haven)}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(grim at the smile)}
<D>__{is that all?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i think so.}
<A>__{iles marches out abruptly, followed by stellman. the door shuts. haven smiles after him, then at mrs. caslon.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{he really isn't that abrupt he }
<A>__{the door opens again, smartly, iles marches back in, kisses mrs. caslon on the cheek.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{goodnight, mary.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<P>__{(warmly)}
<D>__{goodnight, george.}
<A>__{then he marches out again, shutting the door after him.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{you see?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{i think he secretly likes you.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{he's a man who can sure keep a secret.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{would you like a little sherry?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{only if you have some too.}
<A>__{she goes over to a sideboard and pours a little from a decanter into two wine glasses. haven watches her. for the first time he realizes she is a very attractive woman. she smiles as she brings him the wine.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{to your good luck.}
<A>__{haven nods and they sip.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{what mine did the two soldiers try to convoy the gold from?}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{my mine the argus.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(smiling a little)}
<D>__{that brings me to a question i decided not to ask.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<P>__{(smiling back at him)}
<D>__{then i will answer it first. captain iles has asked me to marry him.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i can understand that.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{but you can't understand why captain iles should be involved in the gold business.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i do now.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{it isn't just mine. you must realize there's a lot of gold from all over the territory stored at the post warehouse.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{how much.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{perhaps as much as half a million.}
<P>__{(worried now)}
<D>__{in fact, i have about fifty thousand in my safe now.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{who is doing all this?}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{i don't know... that's the worst part of it... not knowing.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(puts down the glass,}
<D>__{pats her shoulder with casual}
<P>__{reassurance)}
<D>__{i might find out.}
<A>__{he starts for the door and she follows him. at the open door he pauses.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{don't get into trouble }
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{that's why i'm here.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{i know, but }
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{don't worry about it. trouble and i are old enemies. we understand each other.}
<P>__{(he grins at her)}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<P>__{(smiling again)}
<D>__{good luck.}
<A>__{haven walks out and she closes the door thoughtfully and turns away. in a moment the door opens and haven reenters and crosses to her much in the manner that we have seen captain iles do so. haven stops.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you didn't tell me your husband's name.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{ben.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(repeating it)}
<D>__{ben.}
<A>__{he turns and goes out the door. mrs. caslon stands smiling after him. the smile fades for a moment then she dismisses it with a shrug.}
