<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior bud's room}
<A>__{darkness. the door opens and bud snaps on the light.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{my bunk's the only one i can guarantee won't be occupied. you can grab a couple hours before we get there.}
<A>__{lindsey slips past him into his tiny state room, the only private bunk on the rig. rank had its privileges. his hand on the door is just level with her eyes. she notices his wedding ring, a massive band of pure titanium (something your fiancee might have picked out if she had a degree from m.i.t.).}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{what are you still wearing that for?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i don't know. divorce ain't final. forgot to take it off.}
<A>__{bud stays in the doorway. lindsey takes a heaps of bud's cloths off the narrow bunk. start unconsciously straightening the room.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{i haven't worn mine in months.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{yeah, what's his name wouldn't like it. the suit.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{do you always have to call him that? the suit? it makes you sound like such a hick. his name is michael.}
<A>__{lindsey takes off her borrowed tennies and socks. bud eyes her, sounding too causal.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{so what about "michael" then... mr. brooks brothers... mr. bmw. you still seeing him?}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{no, i haven't seen him in a few weeks.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{bud, why are you doing this? it's not part of you life any more.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i will tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{you're right, bud. it was just that simple. aren't you clever? you should get your own show... ask dr. bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.}
<A>__{she closes the watertight door, forcing him out. locks it. she turns and throws her shoe hard against the far wall.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{aaaarrrggh!}
<A>__{she flops down on the bed, sitting... staring at the wall. her armor is gone. she looks small and vulnerable. a long beat. she reaches over to the tiny sink. amid the clutter is a bottle of bud's aftershave. she unscrews it and takes a sniff. catches herself. tosses it.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{shit.}
