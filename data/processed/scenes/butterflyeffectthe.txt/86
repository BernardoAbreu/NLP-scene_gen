<A>__{evan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner. he eyes a piece of paper with an address scrawled on it and gets out.}
<L>__{interior ridgewood diner continuous}
<A>__{a run down greasy spoon. filled with a number of townies and truckers. the place is stale with cigarette smoke and appears decorated in grime motif. evan is about to enter when he spots kayleigh coming out of the kitchen with a tray full of food. kayleigh, now twenty, looks pale and sickly thin. she bangs her hip on the swinging door and an order of food crashes to the floor. her boss stares back in aggravation.}
<C>__{boss}
<D>__{can we get through one goddamned day without you breaking something?}
<A>__{kayleigh's face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up the order. she is humiliated and evan leans back against a pay phone so that she can't see him watching her. as she brings the mess inside the kitchen, a customer pinches her ass. evan closely studies her reaction to the offense. she flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the customer. evan backs out uncomfortably.}
