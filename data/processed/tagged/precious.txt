<L>__{1987 ext harlem street day}
<A>__{a cold wind blows a bright red scarf tangled high on a street lamp. an iron waste bin is blown sideways into an intersection. a stray dog investigates it briefly, urinates and then moves on. a book bag drops onto the pavement. visible from the waist down, a large young woman in a disintegrating leather jacket turns the waste bin upright and then maneuvers it onto the sidewalk. once finished, her thick hands wipe each other until they stop abruptly. here, for the first time, we see her plump, youthful, vacant african american face. it is 16 year old precious jones. something inside the bin has caught her attention. precious gazes down upon a soiled and tattered paperback book as the breath from her nostrils steams. the title of the book staring back up at her is unintelligible. she pushes debris aside to get to it. the book plunges deeper into the trash, as if trying to flee. the sound of an oncoming car approaches. precious pins the book against the bottom of the bin as the sounds of the oncoming car close in. precious finally comes up with the book. its title is still unintelligible. when she flips it over, however, the letters on the cover, which are facing us now, make sense. they read crystal stair: selected works by langston hughes. the car sounds incredibly close. precious looks sharply to her left. an eerie skid precedes an eerier thud! precious, almost hit, falls back on to the pavement as her book skips across the intersection and down into a drain. she lays on the sidewalk pressed against the base of the street lamp with her eyes closed. the car reverses, skids, stops for a sec, shifts and screeches off. the garbage bin, overturned yet again, rocks side to side until settling, to a stop. an ambulance eases up to the intersection. when the stoplight changes, the ambulance motors past precious in no hurry. a moment later, its sirens blare and it speeds off into the distance. the stray dog returns, re investigates the garbage bin, and turns to precious. he licks her face. tom cruise walks up to her. precious' still vacant eyes finally open to see tom, and the red scarf falling from the street lamp towards her. tom gives her a hand up.}
