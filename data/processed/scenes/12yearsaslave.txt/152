<L>__{exterior road by epps' plantation evening}
<A>__{solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in hand. he stares across the expanse. his eyes fixed on something that is a million miles away. slowly solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg tighter and tighter. as the strings are taut, the sound is almost unbearable as solomon tightens bit by bit, as if bones are being cracked one by one. just beyond the breaking point of sound, there is a snap. he then repeats the action. solomon holds the neck of the violin. sliding his thumb and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it at the base. he carefully snaps the neck and removes it from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the ground. he then starts on the body. heaving it on the ground, it falls apart. methodically he breaks the violin into small bits silencing the instrument with a hushed display of violence, rather than aggressive. seems almost to be, in an odd way, respectful.}
