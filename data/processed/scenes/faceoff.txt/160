<D>__{wanda, i've got to tell you something. something crazy...}
<L>__{exterior boathouse yard various shots day}
<A>__{archer emerges into the maze of dry docked boats. silently checking his clip, he discards the empty gun. castor moves stealthily through the narrow paths. hearing a noise behind him boom! castor fires blowing apart an under repair hull. he advances toward the boat, gun ready, when archer appears behind him and follows one step, two steps until castor stops then whirls as archer leaps. the men collapse hard. castor's pistol clatters across the yard toward the docked boat. archer and castor brutally strangle each other digging their fingers deep into their throats. they throttle each other so hard, archer's larynx vocal chip is dislodged. his voice changes, echoing with garbled. static.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{give up, castor. people are going to find out.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{not if i kill you first.}
<A>__{they scramble for the gun but a hand reaches out from the docked boat and picks it up. archer and castor stop dead in their tracks because jamie appears, holding the pistol.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{give it here, jamie.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{no, jamie. don't do it!}
<A>__{everybody gawks because archer and castor are now... both speaking in archer's true voice. and nobody is more confused than jamie.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{listen to my voice, jamie. i'm your father.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{it's a trick, jamie. i'm your father.}
<A>__{jamie swings the gun back and forth baffled.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{shoot him, jamie.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{jamie...}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{shoot him!}
<A>__{jamie fires. archer reels as a slug grazes his shoulder. castor snatches the pistol from jamie's hand.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{you dunce. no kid of mine would miss so badly.}
<A>__{he aims the gun at archer's head.}
<C>__{wanda }

<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{you're both under arrest until a d.n.a. test proves who's who.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{i'm ordering you to back off!}

<D>__{ now!}
<C>__{castor}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can't blame me for trying.}
<A>__{he grabs a shocked jamie shoving the gun under her chin. archer struggles to his feet as castor using jamie as a shield backs out the gate to the garden. archer follows cautiously.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{say goodbye to daddy }
<A>__{jamie whips out the switchblade sinks it into castor's thigh and twists. she dives away. firing wildly, castor staggers back through the gate.}
<C>__{castor }
<D>__{you ungrateful delinquent!}
<B>__{outside gate}
<A>__{as castor turns and staggers away he runs smack into a confused security agent.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{give me your weapon now!}
<A>__{the agent hands over his uzi and castor plugs him.}
<B>__{boatyard}
<A>__{archer and eve make sure jamie's okay.}
<C>__{jamie}
<P>__{(to archer)}
<D>__{who are you? will someone please tell me what's going on?}
<A>__{archer rushes to the gate and hauls it open.}
<B>__{castor}
