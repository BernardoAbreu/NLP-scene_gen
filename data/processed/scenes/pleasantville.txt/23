<A>__{david and jennifer walk two steps into the kitchen when they suddenly freeze agape at the spectacle in front of them:}
<B>__{their pov. parker kitchen.}
<A>__{every breakfast food imaginable has been laid upon the table. there are hotcakes and sausages and biscuits and eggs. pitchers of orange juice are dwarfed by the mountains of ham. the table literally sags under the weight of the food. george parker lowers his morning paper and smiles at his children.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(once again)}
<D>__{morning kids. better get a move on or you're going to be late for school.}
<A>__{they nod, stunned, and wander forward into the room. bright sunlight streams through the kitchen window as a gentle symphony of songbirds sings outside. david and jennifer stare straight ahead as their "mother" adds some waffles to the heap.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{i don't believe this.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{neither do i.}
<C>__{george}

<D>__{here. why don't you have some waffle cakes.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and there's sausage and eggs and some good crisp bacon ...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{... and a ham steak.}
<A>__{betty drenches the waffles in syrup and slathers on a huge slab of butter.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{... and of course, a nice big bowl of oatmeal.}
<A>__{jennifer hesitates then glances over at her "mother" who looks at her expectantly. she glances at david who just looks stunned. jennifer pauses then reaches down and takes a forkful of the oozing mess ...}
