<D>__{of course you are.}
<A>__{the wolf man and the mummy crouch in fear as they face criswell.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{have we in some way made you angry, master?}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{you know better than that.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{we don't know of anything, master...}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{then why do you shake so?}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{it's not often an emperor like you calls on creatures like us.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{well rest easy, i'm not angry with either of you.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{aaaahhhh.}
<A>__{the mummy sighs in relief and the wolf man nods.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{then it is some service you desire of us.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{you are the keepers of the damned. you two know them all. and i am tired of this usual type of entertainment. i want...a decided change.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{the moon! ...is soon gone!}
<A>__{the princess of darkness points up at the full moon.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{there is little time left for the remainder of the evening's pleasures.}
<A>__{the princess of darkness gets up from the seat at the end of the altar and walks around beside criswell's throne.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{yes, yes yes i know all that.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{at the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{i suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{it would seem so, master}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{ahh, but i declare there is still time for some thing.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{there are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, master}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{ahh, good. then i will see them. dismiss the rest.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{yes, sir, master.}
<A>__{bob's hands are wiggling, trying to loosen the rope binding his wrists behind his back around the stone column.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{the ropes are coming loose.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{be careful!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i am it's our only chance.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{nothing is worth your life.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{my guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{i'm frightened. i'm so frightened.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{hold on just a little longer, shirley.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{be careful, oh please be careful. we'll never get out of here alive, i know it. i just feel it.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{yes i feel it in my bones.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you're talking nonsense.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{oh, no i'm not. these heathens probably have an open grave for us.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{they wouldn't dare put us in the same grave or would they?}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{i should hope not. i hate you!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{that sudden?}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{yes, that sudden. if it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this. it's all your fault.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(dejected)}
<D>__{...and i thought you loved me.}
<A>__{the princess of darkness is leaning over, covering her mouth and whispering into criswell's ear, looking over her hand back at shirley.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{not yet. i perhaps have other plans for such a pretty one. no matter, i will tell you when and if you may have her.}
<A>__{the princess of darkness crosses her forearms and bows to criswell.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{the wolf man informs me that the next one is the woman who murdered her husband on their wedding night. now she dances with his skeleton.}
<A>__{the skeleton dance begins. the skeleton dance girl, wearing a white dress and long wedding veil, comes into the clearing with a skeleton. she dances with the skeleton, then dances in the clearing for criswell. the skeleton dance concludes.}
<C>__{criswell}
<P>__{(to shirley)}
<D>__{have you not enjoyed the evening's festivities?}
<A>__{shirley is silent and looks downward.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{ahh, that will soon change when you become one of us!}
<A>__{the wolf man leans back and howls. (he tilts his head back so far his fake rubber wolfman mask comes up and you can see his skin at the bottom of his neck)}
<C>__{the wolf man}
<D>__{wwaaaaaaooooooooooaaaaahhgggghhhaaaa aaaaaaaaahhggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh!}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{it would seem that the wolf man would have you for his own!}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{i have promised both the wolf man and the mummy a reward. it could be that you are that reward.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{you need not worry...not just now, anyway.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{leave her alone, you fiend!}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{fiend is it! you will not be so fortunate. your existence will cease within moments. no one wishes to see a man dance...}
<P>__{(looking at shirley)}
<D>__{and you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{if i could get my hands on you...}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{..oh, you could do nothing!}
<P>__{(to shirley)}
<D>__{i can save you much pain.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{leave her alone, i tell you!}
<C>__{criswell}
<P>__{(to shirley)}
<D>__{i do not joke in my proposal.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{she is to be mine!}
<A>__{it is so}
<D>__{spoken!}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{the princess of darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yet i am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. i have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{no. no! no!}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{i repulse you? very well. it seems you have chosen your own fate. live with it! i should say die with it!}
<A>__{bob looks down somberly, then looks over at shirley.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i've got the ropes loose now. i've got my hands free. be careful don't change your expression too much. they must not catch on.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{what can we do against them?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i don't know, yet. we'll just have to watch our chance. when it comes i will know what to do i hope i will know what to do.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{i still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{all right. put it on heavy.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{my old boyfriend tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this. at least he's got brains.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{him!}
<A>__{i will bet he sleeps}
<D>__{with all the lights on.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{maybe so.}
<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{shot of the mummy talking to the wolf man}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{i could make her another cleopatra...}
<C>__{the wolf man}
<D>__{ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{without the snake, of course.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{ahh, she will be yours.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{when!?}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{at your discretion...but first, i desire more entertainment.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{the moon is almost gone!}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{ahh, there is yet time.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{at the first sight of the morning's rays' light...}
<C>__{criswell}
<P>__{(getting annoyed)}
<D>__{i know the laws of the night. i state there is still time for yet another.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<P>__{(forcefully)}
<D>__{i would have time for my own pleasures!}
<C>__{criswell}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{your own pleasure comes only after mine, when i desire it. i am the sole ruler of the dark world. there is no one to challenge my authority here. my word is the law all powerful. no one is to challenge that authority, no one! . is that understood? it is my command.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{i understand, master}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of everlasting despair. now are there others?}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{there are others.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{well then let us proceed.}
<A>__{the princess of darkness snaps her fingers three times, summoning the zombie dance girl.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{she lived as a zombie in life, so she will remain forever a zombie in death.}
<A>__{the zombie dance girl dances.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{easy, shirley. easy!}
<A>__{the zombie dance concludes.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{the moon sinks lower into the hills! we must hurry to the finish.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{i will decide the conclusion.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{you had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.}
<C>__{criswell}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{then cancel my order.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{the moon is almost gone!}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{there is yet time. don't you want your own pleasure?}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{oh, if there is only time!}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{hahh, there is always time... all in good time...there is always time. you shall have your pleasure. that ... i decree}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<P>__{(looking at shirley)}
<D>__{all others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to her}
<P>__{(toward the dancer)}
<D>__{this one would have died for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!}
<A>__{the fluff dance girl dances for approval. the fluff dance ends. criswell looks over at the princess of darkness.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{the time...is short.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{for what!?!}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{your pleasures of course!}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{you mean...!}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{you may take her now.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{is there time?}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{you better hope there is.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{thank you, master! thank you.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{now hurry, hurry. i will watch! your desires may be my pleasure also...our fitting climax to an evening's enter tainment. you must...hurry now.}
<A>__{the princess of darkness begins ceremoniously dancing with her long sacrificial dagger, slowly moving toward shirley, gazing back at criswell seductively. she finally gets to shirley and cuts the button off of shirley's shirt, which was so tight it was about to burst open anyway. she unsnaps the front of shirley's bra. bob sees his chance and makes his attempt at a "move," merely stepping forward. he is instantly hammer fisted on the back of the neck by the wolf man, and falls down unconscious. the princess of darkness raises her long dagger high above shirley's head. but suddenly, the sun rises (it is already high overhead), and the night creatures lose their power. the princess of darkness clings to shirley's arm, as she slowly sinks down to the ground, losing all strength. the camera pans around, showing shirley and bob's faces, then back to the ghouls, all of whom have turned to steaming skeletons. only their clothing and bones remain. quick zoom in on criswell's throne. criswell's steaming skeleton still sits, surveying the cemetery, wearing his cape.}
<T>__{fade to black: fade in:}
<L>__{exterior woods morning}
<A>__{at the clearing in the woods near the car wreck, bob and shirley are lying on their backs on the ground, just as they were after the crash, before they got up to investigate the strange music that led them to the ghouls. there are two doctors examining bob and shirley. in the foreground, we see a reporter's shoulder and hands. he is writing down details of the accident in a small paper pad.}
<D>__{doctor #1 easy, miss, everything's gonna be alright.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{bob? bob? doctor #1 he's right here beside you. he'll be alright too.}
<A>__{the reporter walks around and crouches beside shirley and doctor #1, and continues writing in his pad. a newspaper photographer crouches in the foreground to get a shot of the accident scene and victims.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{where are they, where did they go? they tried to kill me. doctor #2 what's this you say? who was going to kill you?}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{the ghouls they all turned into skeletons. doctor #2 take it easy, miss. doctor #1 what she needs is a good rest.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{it's true, i tell you, it's true! they all turned into skeletons. she she cut me here.}
<A>__{shirley points to her abdomen where the princess of darkness had made the x with her fingernail. nurse crouches down and pulls out a length of medical tape, then hands it to the doctor. she cuts another piece of tape, but the doctors don't realize this and leave her hanging...}
<D>__{doctor #1 probably was bruised in the crash. doctor #2 you know, you two were very lucky.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{i love you bob. i really do. forgive me?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{there's nothing to forgive. it was all a dream.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{you love me then?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{of course i do.}
<A>__{the doctors put shirley onto a stretcher while the photographer takes more pictures. they put her into the back of an ambulance. then after the doctor listens to bob's neck with a stethoscope, bob just gets up and walks into the back of the ambulance.}
<C>__{criswell }
<D>__{as it is with all the night people, they are destroyed by the first rays of the sun. but upon the first appearance of the deep shadows of the night, and when the moon is full, they will return, to rejoice...in their evil lust, and take back with them any mortal who might happen along.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior mausoleum, morning.}
<A>__{criswell is back in his coffin, sitting upright.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{yes, they were lucky, those two young people...may you be so lucky...but do not trust to luck, at the full of the moon, when the night is dark...make a wide path around the unholy grounds...of the night people. who can say that we do not exist can you? but now, we return to our graves, and you}
<P>__{(pointing at audience)}
<D>__{may join us soon!}
