<L>__{exterior tyrannosaur nest night}
<A>__{elsewhere in the forest, it's not such a happy story. peter ludlow, still alive, drops through the air and crunches to the muddy ground. dizzy, bleeding, the breath knocked out of him, he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud. from behind him, he hears a chirping sound. he turns. he's in the tyrannosaur nest. the baby tyrannosaur faces him, still with a strange aluminum foil cast on its leg. the baby squeaks with excitement as it toddles toward him. ludlow scrambles to his feet, unsure what to do. both adult tyrannosaurs stand outside the nest, staring down at him. the baby runs toward ludlow, so he turns and runs away. but in an instant, the male brings its head down, knocking ludlow to the ground. then it raises its head again. watching. waiting. ludlow gets up again and tries to run, but now the female rex strikes, knocking him over again. ludlow tries to crawl away, on all fours. the male bends down and closes its jaws around one of his legs, holding it tightly. ludlow screams and the rex bits down decisively. the bone breaks with a dry snap. ludlow howls in pain, unable to move, and the baby toddles forward eagerly. ludlow can only stare as it leaps up, onto his chest, and opens its jaws wide. peter ludlow screams.}
