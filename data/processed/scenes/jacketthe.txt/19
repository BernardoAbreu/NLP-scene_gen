<A>__{dr. thomas becker (overworked, dogmatic, disenchanted), dr. beth lorenson (30s, unassuming, perceptive), and dr. gries (20s, green) are convened with other staff at a routine hospital meeting. these doctors deal in the currency of madness every day and wear the heaviness of that burden on their faces.}

<D>__{how'd he dodge a conviction?}
<C>__{chief of staff}

<C>__{dr. becker}
<D>__{[beat] so why isn't he just in the psych ward of the county jail?}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{apparently, he's a decorated vet. and had another one testify for him. who knows? [to dr. becker] tom, do you mind taking him?}
