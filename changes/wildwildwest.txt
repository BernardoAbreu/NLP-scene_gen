Shovel Guy springs to his feet and swings on West. West grabs the shovel and they struggle for possession... Wrench Guy comes out of nowhere and wants a piece of the action. But West uses the shovel to deflect the swing- ing wrench... sparks fly. West gains sole possession of the shovel and mule-kicks Shovel Guy OUT OF FRAME. West spins just in time to land a crippling blow to Wrench Guy's back. Shovel Guy grabs the shovel. He and West tug-o'-war again. West ducks under the shovel and moves back-to-front with him. West elbows him in the ribs. He responds by putting West in a choke hold. West swings the shovel wildly but hits his target -- shovel Guy's head! West steps back, gets his footing and, for good measure, whacks him in the back. Wrench Guy attacks. West defends himself with the shovel and lands a stiff kick to his stomach. Wrench Guy goes down... West turns, hits Shovel Guy in the chest with the shovel and he goes down... Wrench Guy sneaks up on West from behind and swings at his head. West, on instinct, lifts the shovel and blocks the deadly blow at the last second. West has now found his rhythm... He swings and shovel and connects with... first, the foot, then the chin, and last but not least, the head -- BOINK! West drops the shovel and, World Wrestling Federation style, picks him up and hurls him into the space between the gears. We won't see him anymore! West pivots and WHACK!... Shovel Guy plants a neat little roundhouse kick squarely on West's jaw. West backs up and catches another in the stomach. Then... Shovel Guy really shows what he's made of... He does a series of jump-kicks, round-houses and fan- kicks into the air. All perfectly timed, all deadly.}
