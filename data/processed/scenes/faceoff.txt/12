<L>__{interior hangar day}
<A>__{the jet hatch pops open castor leaps from it, firing. two fbi agents drop riddled. pollux appears at the hatch an fbi sharpshooter fires, grazing pollux's shoulder. staggered, pollux falls castor catches him before he hits the floor simultaneously blasting the sharpshooter. castor drags pollux back into the smoke filled hangar. archer arrives and quickly checks the dead agents, his anger building. he signals tito and the others to spread out.}
<B>__{deep in hangar}
<A>__{a maze of airplane debris and heavy machinery. led by archer, the fbi agents pick their way through it. rookie loomis snaps alert did he see something? advancing carefully, he comes up on... castor staunching pollux's shoulder wound. pollux sees the agent and fires. loomis hits the floor his bleeding ear is shredded. suddenly a forklift charges down on castor and pollux. tito is at the wheel. castor fires forcing tito to dive off. the forklift careens on driving apart the brothers. the forklift upends a stack of heavy crates pinning pollux. castor tries to free his trapped brother.}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{forget it go! go!}
<A>__{he slaps his glock into pollux's hand.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{wherever they put you, i will find a way to get you out...}
<A>__{pollux starts firing covering castor as he runs through a tunnel which leads to an adjoining hangar. suddenly wanda presses her machine pistol into pollux's head. as pollux raises his gun tito grabs his hand.}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{ not unless you want that 200 i.q. splattered all over the floor.}
<P>__{(as archer approaches)}
<D>__{we got him now, jon.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{that's what you always say. seal it off. i'm going in.}
<A>__{archer moves away from the group and enters the tunnel. music as archer and castor begin their cat and mouse dance. sensing archer, castor pauses by an old landing gear. he draws a fresh pistol from his ankle holster and moves on. archer pauses at the landing gear... his own stealthy movements mirroring castor's. castor waits behind a stack of steel drums... his gaze trying to penetrate the darkness... he snaps his fingers. the sound echoes as he tries to draw archer in. archer reacts to the sound and snaps back answering the challenge. as the deadly beat between them continues blam blam blam! archer spins away just as castor opens fire from the gloom... one step ahead.}
