<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{"dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."}

<D>__{all right, miles. let me tell you everything you think you know. i was married to rex for a long time. i was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. there was only one thing i did wrong during the five years we were together. i got five years older. think he should be able to ditch me for that?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{he wants a reconciliation.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{see the tape. then we can discuss reconciliation. rex screwed up and i nailed his ass. now i'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. then i'm getting on with my life. that's all i'm after.}

<C>__{miles}
<D>__{mmmm }
<A>__{he paces, hands clasped behind his back, affecting to be lost in thought. marylin watches him. finally miles, still pacing, declaims:}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{"dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery..."}
<A>__{marylin looks up from her handkerchief with a look of startled irritation. miles stops pacing and turns to face her with a faint smile.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{do you know those lines, mrs. rexroth?}
<A>__{marylin examines him with guarded eyes. ruth sensing something unscripted going on, tries to cut it off.}

<D>__{i see. and what were you going to tell us about patty slash marylin?}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{when she was a tiny girl? and people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? she never said the usual things little girls say like nurse ballerina anchorwoman? she always said }
<P>__{(very shirley temple)}
<D>__{"when i grow up, i want to be divorced."}
<A>__{she laughs happily at the memory.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{divorce was her childhood aspiration?}
