<L>__{interior sid's room continuous}
<A>__{broken toy sounds emit from behind woody. he turns from the window to see...}
<B>__{the mutant toys}
<A>__{converging all around buzz.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{buzz!!}
<A>__{still holding onto buzz's arm, woody jumps down from the desk and runs to buzz's rescue.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{go away, you disgusting freaks!}
<A>__{babyface turns from the fray and charges at woody with his erector set pinchers. woody cowers, shielding himself from buzz's arm. babyface clamps onto the arm and has a tug o war with woody.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{alright back! back, you cannibals!}
<A>__{woody loses his grip on the arm and sails across the room, crashing into the wall. by now there is no sight of buzz within the swarming mass of mutant toys. woody attacks the mob with a vengeance.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{he is still alive, and you're not gonna get him, you monsters!}
<A>__{he furiously throws the mutant toys aside, digging his way to...}
<B>__{buzz}
<A>__{he is sitting up, his broken arm now newly attached. woody's anger turns to confusion.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{hey?! hey, they fixed you!}
<A>__{woody shakes buzz's arm to confirm what he's seeing is real when he looks to the mutants.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(continued)}
<D>__{but but they're cannibals. we saw them eat those other toys.}
<A>__{the mutant toys part to reveal the recent victims of sid's last "operation": the janie doll and pterodactyl. their heads have been taped back on the correct bodies. the mutants all innocently stare at woody.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{uh...sorry. i...i thought that you were gonna...}
<P>__{(laughs nervously)}
<D>__{...you know, eat my friend.}
<A>__{immediately, the mutant toys retreat back into the dark corners of the room.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{hey! no, no, wait! hey! what's wrong?}
<C>__{sid's mom }
<D>__{sid!}
<C>__{sid }
<D>__{not now, mom, i'm busy!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{sid!!!}
<A>__{footsteps approach the bedroom. woody tries to pick up the still depressed buzz, but he just goes limp.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{buzz! c'mon, get up! buzz, you're...}
<P>__{(grunt)}
<D>__{...get up...}
<A>__{woody begins dragging buzz towards the bed, but their progress is too slow. he shakes buzz hard.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{fine. let sid trash you. but don't blame me.}
<A>__{woody leaves buzz sitting alone in the middle of the floor and hides underneath a nearby milkcrate just as... sid enters carrying a big box.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{it came! it finally came!}
<A>__{sid runs over to his workbench and rips open the box.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(reverently)}
<D>__{the big one.}
<A>__{he pulls out a rocket with "the big one" written on it.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(reading the rocket label)}
<D>__{"extremely dangerous. keep out of reach of children." cool...}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{what am i gonna blow? man...hey, where's that wimpy cowboy doll?}
<A>__{sid spots the milkcrate and picks it up. no woody. angle: underside of milkcrate out of sid's view, woody presses against the inside, hanging on for dear life. sfx: buzz's laser sid looks down and notices he's stepping on buzz, activating his laser.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{yes! i've always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit. ha ha.}
<A>__{he places buzz and the milkcrate on the workbench and throws a toolbox on top of the crate. the impact of the toolbox dislodges woody from his hiding place. woody quickly ducks under a magazine on the floor of the crate "jail." woody watches helplessly as sid fishes out a roll of electrical tape from the toolbox and, with an irreverent chuckle, tapes buzz to the rocket. sfx: thunderclap a flash of lightning interrupts the moment.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{oh, no...}
<A>__{sid crosses to the window to see a huge rainstorm commence. sullenly, he smacks his head against the window.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{aw, man...!}
<A>__{woody heaves a sigh of relief. suddenly sid's face brightens. he turns his focus from the rain to the buzzrocket.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(as newscaster)}
<D>__{sid phillips reporting. launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site. tomorrow's forecast...}
<A>__{sid smacks buzz down on the desk, winds his alarm clock, and places it next to buzz.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{sunny. ha ha ha. sweet dreams.}
