<L>__{exterior alley behind downscale d.c. bar night}
<A>__{a figure appears at the end of the alley, moving toward us. it could be mulder from this distance, but as the figure comes closer we recognize him as kurtzweil. moving into the f.g., checking behind him, ahead of him. jumpy. he takes a cautious beat, then moves to the door leading into the bar (established), reaching for the knob. opening it, finding the well manicured man standing there.}
<D>__{well manicured man dr. kurtzweil, isn't it? dr. alvin kurtzweil?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<A>__{kurtzweil is shaken by the sight of this man. backpedaling a bit, looking around and behind him for an ambush.}

<A>__{the w.m.m. steps out of the doorway, following kurtzweil.}
<D>__{well manicured man i'm quite sure whatever you told agent mulder, you have your good reason. it's a weakness in men our age; the urge to confess.}
<P>__{(stopping his walk)}
<D>__{i forgive you that.}
<A>__{kurtzweil is thrown by the words, and the delivery. stopping his backward progress. studying this upright and civil man.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{what are you doing here? what do you want from me? well manicured man you must try to understand, what i'm here to do is only to protect my children. you and i have but short lives left. i can only hope the same isn't true for them.}

<A>__{a town car has pulled into the alley behind him. accelerating fast down the narrow corridor. effectively trapping kurtzweil in. as he squints into its headlights, then turns back with fear in his eyes to the}
