<A>__{the visor of the high tech helmet is shattered, presumably by the explosion. the wearer rips it off, revealing a younger reese, minus his burn scar. his face is bathed in sweat, lit by the glow from a crt scope sight on a strange looking rifle. the sound of screams and hoarse shouts not far off, and a continuous low murmuring of radio chatter, grid coordinates, casualties, unit placements, medic requests. reese looks over his shoulder at his teammate, a girl of about sixteen, gaunt, dirty, heavily armed like himself. dollying as they start to belly crawl through the bones and wreckage. reese looks up. through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying sphinx like shape moves against the sky...obscured by dust and blinding sweeps of its searchlights. though we see little, this is an h k,hunter killer mobile ground unit. reese crawls, pacing the h k, under and through, on elbows and knees, past mounds of charred skulls. they pass the body of a child, a boy of about 10, center punched with a smoking hole. the boy clutches a rifle. more bodies. some in rags, some in uniforms like theirs. women. old men. children. they're all dirty and gaunt, scabrous. and still bleeding. reese scrabbles past a dark rat hole and there are human rats in it. some of them are sobbing, or screaming. another explosion. the glare lights the huddled few. human vermin with mud caked weapons that haven't been invented yet. soldiers in a nightmare war. reese and his teammate stop behind a blasted wall, having outflanked the massive h k. its flashing blue lights flick across the walls, its searchlights sear through the debris. wider, showing the h k more clearly...a blast scarred chrome leviathon, with hydraulic arms folded mantis like against its 'torso', and huge underslung gun turrets. reese leaps up and straight arms a satchel charge into its path. one tread rolls over the explosive. guns and searchlights swivel. the head turns ponderously. reese's partner rises, poised to throw hers. a power bolt catches her at the top of her arc, blowing}
