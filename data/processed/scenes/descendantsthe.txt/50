<L>__{exterior king house day}
<A>__{matt bursts out of his house and starts running down the street.}
<L>__{exterior nu'uanu neighborhood day}
<A>__{matt comes sprinting around a corner.}
<L>__{exterior the mitchells' house day}
<A>__{matt arrives at his neighbors' house and lets himself in the kitchen door.}
<L>__{interior the mitchells' house continuous}
<A>__{matt passes through the kitchen into the living room.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hello! it's me, matt!}
<A>__{mark and kai appear at the top of the stairs looking as though they haven't been downstairs all day.}
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{oh, hey, matt.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you guys weren't sleeping, were you?}
<A>__{as they come downstairs }
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{no, we were just fighting. come on in. want a drink? want some coffee?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{what were you fighting about?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{stupid.}
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{it's not stupid. he wants us to throw parties and have people over, which we do, of course, but who ends up doing all the work? me.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's work that's totally unnecessary. you don't have to do anything. nobody's forcing you to clean and buy a new outfit and think of some goddamn theme cocktail. we can just invite people over last minute and drink whatever we have and hang out. it's more fun that way, anyway.}
<A>__{as they continue their argument, matt is struck by the pettiness of everyday life. he at once pities it, is impatient with it, and longs for it.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{you know what? we can talk about it later. matt didn't come over to hear us squabble.}
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{shit, matt. is elizabeth is there any news?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{in fact there is. i will tell you in a moment. who is he?}
<P>__{(off their silence)}
<D>__{does she love him? who is he?}
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{matt.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i'm sorry to put you in this position. but i'm not really the one who put you there, am i? i just want to know who this guy is that my wife has been... seeing.}
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{oh, matt, you're angry.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you could be a therapist. very keen powers of observation.}
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{wow. i think we should talk another time. i think you need to cool it.}
<A>__{matt sits. he's not leaving. no one speaks.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{is it troy? that fucking neanderthal?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you don't know him.}
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{oh, don't you even, mark. shame on you. you're her friend.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm matt's friend too. and this is a very unique and dramatic situation. i'd want to know.}
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{don't betray her when she can't even defend herself. matt, you may not be able to hear this right now, but it's not her fault. women have needs.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{are you fucking kidding me?}
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{your marriage was not... you worked so hard to make partner, and no one can take that away from you. but then you made partner, and you only got busier. and it's not like you were so involved with the girls. she was lonely.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so you're going to talk to me in cliches about women? nothing is ever a woman's fault. was it still going on when she had the accident?}
<A>__{kai looks away. mark nods.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{but i stayed out of it, matt. anytime kai talked about it, i walked away.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(to kai)}
<D>__{and you what? you probably egged her on. add some drama to your life without any actual risk. whom do you think you're protecting anyway? she doesn't need your protection it's over. she's going to die.}
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{don't say that.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i almost told you yesterday. she's never going to wake up. it's for sure now. you hear me? we're pulling the plug. you were putting lipstick on a corpse.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{come on, matt. that's a little intense.}
<A>__{kai's face dissolves into tears. mark reaches out to comfort her. everybody falls back to earth.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean to take it out on you guys. i just... does she love him?}
<A>__{matt looks at him blankly, then at kai. he'd like to know too.}
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{how can you ask about him when she's going to die? who cares? yes, she loves him, loved him, whatever. she's crazy about him. she was going to ask you for a divorce.}
<A>__{matt is stunned but oddly relieved. the truth, once revealed, blows a calming wind.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you still haven't told me who he is. i guess it doesn't matter.}
<A>__{matt rises to his feet and leave.}
