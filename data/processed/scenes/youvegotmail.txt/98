<D>__{my mother died when i was ten. i was staying with my father, who is not famous for intimacy, and whose way of breaking the news of her death was to tell me she would not be coming to pick me up as usual. it was a car accident, and i don't know where she was going or who she was with, and i assume what i owe her is my tendency to cover almost any emotion with a joke. a useful gift, unless you want to know what you're feeling. she was very beautiful. people toss that word around a lot, but my mother was.}
