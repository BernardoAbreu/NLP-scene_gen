<L>__{interior restaurant night}
<A>__{dressed up and wearing party hats, kirk, stainer, devon, jack and about thirty others stand in a small, classy restaurant. the place is decorated with balloons and streamers. a huge banner reads, "happy birthday katie!"}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{seriously, what's with the banner? she's blind, right? seems like they could have saved a few bucks there.}
<A>__{patty runs in.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{here they come! everybody hide!}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{is that really necessary?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{stainer! just hide.}
<A>__{they hide. molly leads her sister, katie, into the restaurant. "surprise!" molly hugs katie.}
<C>__{kirk }
<P>__{(to stainer)}
<D>__{still think she's al qaeda?}
<A>__{stainer brushes off the comment. molly waves kirk over.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{katie, i'd like you to meet kirk.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{it's so nice to meet you, i've heard great things.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, thank you. molly raves about her big sister non stop.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{katie reaches out to feel kirk's face. she's a bit perplexed by the result. two blind teenaged boys approach.}
<C>__{blind teen}
<D>__{mrs. mccall?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{robert! is jerry with you?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{yes, ma'am. happy birthday.}
<C>__{katie}
<P>__{it's so nice you came. (to molly)}
<D>__{these are two of my star pupils, robert and jerry. boys, this is my sister, molly.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{it's nice to meet you.}
<A>__{they each feel molly's face and then start elbowing one another like a couple of horny construction workers. a cake is brought in as everyone sings an unrecognizable but uncopyrighted birthday song. katie blows out her candles.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{what's your wish, katie?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i wish kirk would play the piano for me.}
<A>__{kirk's face drops. molly kisses her sister on the forehead as she has obviously coached the response. immediately patty is behind kirk, pushing him. kirk tries to politely decline but now katie has him by the hand and is leading him to the piano bench. everyone applauds and cheers for him to play.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{really. i can barely play.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{come on, kirk! for my birthday?}
<A>__{kirk is sweating. he reaches for the keys but he is now white as a ghost. molly watches in suspense, rethinking what she's done. kirk's hands shake. he moves them around, hunting for a place to begin. the party goers stare and the room gets quiet. kirk puts his hand over his mouth as though he might vomit. molly presses play on a cd player behind the bar. suddenly, a cheap trick song kicks in over the restaurant's sound system. katie jumps up to dance with her friends. kirk gets up from the piano and tries to laugh it off. talon appears behind him and puts a hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{talon}
<D>__{it's okay kirk. you'll rock us next time right chief?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, hey talon. thanks.}
<C>__{talon}
<D>__{i'm glad you're here. i feel terrible about our little misunderstanding. i don't know what had me thinking you were a gay fella. molly tells me you two have been seeing each other.}
<A>__{patty passes between them and gives talon a dirty look.}
<C>__{talon }
<D>__{she's got every right. i'd hate me too. (then) i want to congratulate you, poncho. you're the better man. now, i will step aside and truly wish you the best of luck. i wouldn't wish losing that girl on my worst foe. but, make no mistake, you blow it and i will be waiting in wings. love and war, right chief?}
<A>__{talon gives kirk a respectful military salute. kirk holds his forced confidence until talon departs. once alone, kirk's poise deflates and he plops down into a chair. the party goes on and katie opens a small present.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh, it's a dvd.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{who's this from?}
<A>__{nobody claims it but jack and devon look at stainer.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{what? it's closed captioned.}
<A>__{patty and kirk are sitting and talking at a table that is away from the group. across the room, talon raises a glass to them. patty gives talon the finger.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what did he do?}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{listen, molly would kill me if she knew i was telling you this but i'm trying to do you a favor.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{molly has this physical...um issue. you know, kind of like a birth defect?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{it's not a big deal but she's really self conscious about it. talon and some other guys she's dated have been weirded out and made her feel like a freak.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{it's better if she tells you but if you can't deal with it, just get lost now and don't put her through that heartbreak again.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no, no. i wouldn't do that.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{good. 'cause if you do, it'll be your last conscious act... (she stands) cake?}
<A>__{patty heads off to get some cake. kirk sits, considering this information. he looks at molly. she is wearing a small black dress. she looks perfect in every way. kirk crosses the room and walks out to the...}
