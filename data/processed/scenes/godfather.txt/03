<L>__{ext day: mall entrance (summer 1945)}
<A>__{outside the main gate of the mall, several men in suits, working together with a man in a dark sedan, walk in and out of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers down in their notebooks. we hear the music and laughter coming from the party in the distance. a man stops at a limousine and copies down the number. barzini, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the watchful eyes of two bodyguards as he makes his way to embrace don corleone in the courtyard. the men walk down another row of parked cars. put another number in the notebook. a shiney new cadillac with wooden bumpers. peter clemenza, dancing the tarantella joyously, bumping bellies with the ladies.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{paulie...wine...wine.}
<A>__{he mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief. paulie hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings it to him.}
<C>__{paulie}
<D>__{you look terrif on the floor!}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{what are you, a dance judge? go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.}
<A>__{paulie nods and leaves; clemenza takes a breath, and leaps back into the dance. the men walk down another row of parked cars. put another number in the notebook. tessio, a tall, gentle looking man, dances with a nine year old girl, her little black party shoes planted on his enormous brown shoes. the men move on to other parked cars, when sonny storms out of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by clemenza and paulie.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{buddy, this is a private party.}
<A>__{the man doesn't answer, but points to the driver of the sedan. sonny menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him. the driver merely flips open his wallet to a greed card, without saying a word. sonny steps back, spits on the ground, turns, and walks away, followed by clemenza, paulie, and another two men. he doesn't say a thing for most of the walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to paulie.}

<D>__{goddamn fbi...don't respect nothing.}
