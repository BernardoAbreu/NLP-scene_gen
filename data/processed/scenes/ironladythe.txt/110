<A>__{naval men murmuring messages quietly to naval attaches. male lips to male ears, something margaret has seen all her life. francis pym and john nott stand near margaret.}
<L>__{intercut :}
<A>__{(stock footage) the naval fleet sails towards the falklands. a map of south georgia and the falkland islands. model boats sit on the water, flags sit on the islands. argentinian flags. margaret stares at the map. a whispered message to one of the attaches. he moves a model boat on the map a few inches, leading a fleet of smaller model boats.}
<C>__{naval attache 1}
<D>__{the argentinian ship the general belgrano and her escorts are pursuing course 273 degrees toward the argentinian mainland. we are tracking it with our submarine hms conqueror.}
<A>__{he points to a model submarine at some distance from the argentinian boats.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{is this ship a threat?}
<C>__{admiral fieldhouse}
<D>__{both of these ships are carrying exocet missiles, prime minister. just yesterday they launched then aborted an attack inside the exclusion zone. there is a risk they could try it again.}
<C>__{francis pym}
<D>__{the belgrano is sailing directly away from the islands. can it really be regarded as a threat ?}
<C>__{admiral fieldhouse}
<D>__{she's been changing course continually. there's a strong possibility that they're attempting a pincer movement on our carrier group.}
<C>__{admiral fieldhouse }
<D>__{i advise that we engage them: hit the belgrano as a warning to the others. send them all back to port.}
<A>__{margaret turns to john nott and francis pym.}
<C>__{francis pym}
<D>__{it'll play badly internationally. we'll be seen as aggressors.}
<A>__{she stares at the map once more. one of the men supervising the map moves the model of the belgrano a fraction further north.}
<C>__{john nott}
<D>__{this will be an escalation, prime minister.}
<A>__{she looks to leach.}
<C>__{leach}
<D>__{if there is to be an escalation, it's better that we start it.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{it is steaming away, prime minister.}
<A>__{everyone is staring at margaret. even the assistants bustling in the background have stopped and are listening. male faces turned to her. she herself seems caught in a pincer movement between the politicians and the servicemen.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{sink it.}
