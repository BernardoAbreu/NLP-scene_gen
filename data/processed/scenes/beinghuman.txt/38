<L>__{interior reception room night}
<A>__{the two visitors that await lucinnius and hector are an unpromising sight. they are big men, unsophisticated and look uncomfortable in their well cut togas. a couple of the godfather's foot soldiers. they greet lucinnius deferentially, but he knows that they would break his back at the whim of their master.}
<C>__{visitor}
<D>__{good evening, lucinnius. cyprian asked us if we could be of any assistance... in the business that you have to conduct tonight... to make that business as... comfortable... as you could wish...}
<A>__{lucinnius sighs, as his last hope expires.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{thank you, gentlemen... but i feel that i will be capable of taking care of my affairs tonight without your help... thank cyprian for his kind thought...}
<A>__{the heavies metaphorically keep their foot in the door.}
<C>__{visitor}
<D>__{we're spending the night at the house of nepos, not far from here. don't hesitate to send your man for us... at any time... we're anxious that things should go well for you.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{thank you. good night.}
<C>__{visitor}
<D>__{we'll call in the morning at any rate... just to make sure.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{hector is closing the door when one of the visitors talks roughly to him.}
<C>__{visitor}
<D>__{you. come here.}
<A>__{hector instinctively looks to his master. lucinnius doesn't protest, but retreats into the house. hector is left alone with the visitors.}
<C>__{visitor}
<D>__{he looks like the kind that'll want some help. have you ever killed before?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{only chickens.}
<C>__{visitor}
<D>__{he's not much different. use a thin blade, but long. get it in deep... the heart... feel for a space between the ribs...}
<A>__{he prods at hector's body freely, showing him what to do. if it is ticklish, hector doesn't let on.}
<C>__{visitor}
<D>__{... or go in from the back... any place he'll let you...}
<A>__{we leave hector nodding obediently as this weirdest of coaching lessons continues.}
<C>__{visitor}
<D>__{getting it out's not as easy as you might think... you have to twist a bit... to get over the stickiness...}
