<L>__{interior drainage tunnel that moment}
<A>__{a dank, but cozy, hideout; warm steam hisses from a grate in the floor. rumbling sounds fill the little chamber as a subway train passes directly underneath. a little farther back there's an access shaft, with a jacob's ladder, leading to the train tracks below. poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard boxes the boy vigilante's stash. the first contains tins of food, plus various odds and ends. the second's more in line with what he needs it's full of old clothing. a train rumbles past underneath. bruce removes his cowl and sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get him out of the park. a wool hat and a long, moth eaten topcoat: perfect. as he's pulling them out of the box, he spies something extremely odd it's a costume a spangled red and green gymnasts outfit with a little yellow cape neatly folded and in pristine condition. he removes it carefully from the box and holds it up in front of him. stitched on the vest is a single initial, "r," in a black circle. he stares at the whole mystifying ensemble in complete befuddlement... the roar of the train subsides, and he hears a scuffling noise. someone's in the tunnel with him. he lowers the costume abruptly revealing dick, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front of him not three feet away. the kid's just crawled up through the access shaft, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder messing with his stuff:}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{it's mine!}
<A>__{he lunges furiously at bruce. the two of them tumble back into the grate at the tunnel entrance, knocking it loose }
