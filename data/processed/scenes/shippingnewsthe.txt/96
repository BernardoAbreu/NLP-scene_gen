<L>__{interior gammy bird late night}
<A>__{quoyle alone with his cut and paste, making up the front page layout. moonlight on fallen snow through the window. late enough, quiet enough, to hear... ...the vehicle drive up, the engine turn off. the footfalls to the door, which swings open. the last person he'd expect to see. especially with a bottle. of cuervo gold. they stare at each other. only he smiles.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{hey. congratulations.}
<A>__{she shoots him a quizzical look. we see the edge right off, even if he doesn't.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{last night. on the stage? you were...}
<A>__{shakes his head with innocent admiration. she puts the bottle on his desk.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{it was easy. i just kept thinkin'. how would petal do it?}
<A>__{he hears it now, right enough. the anger, the cuervo. she stalks on over to the coffee counter, only a bit wobbly. plucks up two styrofoam cups.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{we're friends, right? friends drink together.}
<A>__{back to his desk. shrugs her coat off onto the floor. pullover and jeans, she looks terrific. hikes her butt up onto the edge of his desk.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{i asked a quest...}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{i will drink with you. if you're not done yet.}
<A>__{her soft throaty laugh. he hasn't seen her this way. can't decide if it's more scary or exciting.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{not drunk enough yet to talk about petal. which we always seem to do.}
<A>__{opens the bottle. about four fingers are gone.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{let's talk about me. which we don't.}
<A>__{pours herself another two. thinks before she says...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{growin' up, all i wanted from this place was out. imagine. give up all this.}
<A>__{pours two fingers for him. stretches her body to slide the cup across the desk. the cuervo sloshes.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{i ran off to toronto, went to school. wanted to be a social worker. for kids.}
<A>__{she's looking at her cup now. not at him.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{came back one summer. fell for herold prowse. that. was that.}
<A>__{takes a swallow. closes her eyes.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{did you know i was a liar?}
<A>__{opens her eyes. straight into his. did you?}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{herold liked other women. but you know how that is.}
<A>__{sure you do.}
<C>__{wavey }
<D>__{he didn't die. not that he didn't deserve to.}
<A>__{quoyle blinks. a perfect stunned ox gape.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{see, i'm a good liar.}
<A>__{drains her cup.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{he ran off to seattle with some bitch. when his damaged son was two months old. and nobody knew.}
<A>__{an ice cold wink.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{like i said. it's four years ago. and it's yesterday.}
<A>__{pours herself another. savors the memory.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{so i took his boat out. i sunk it. and told my little story. grieving widow.}
<A>__{shrugs a drunken, careless shrug.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{i was leaving, of course. why humiliate myself on the wayout?}
<A>__{yes?}
<C>__{wavey }
<D>__{but a funny thing happened. on my way out.}
<A>__{her eyes are deeper now. and for a beat, the anger slips away.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{all these funny, odd little folks? they put their hearts around me. so i wouldn't be alone. having lost the man i loved.}
<A>__{silence. a real one.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{and since i knew, to my shame, that is exactly what i had lost. i let go of the will to leave. i did.}
<A>__{i did.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{decided to let my child grow up. around folks better than his mom.}
<A>__{stares in his eyes.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{you're quite the talker.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{i take pride in that.}
<A>__{so she smiles. but the bitterness is there in it.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{well, this morning. the man i loved. came back.}
<A>__{and the world. ceases to spin. one man's world, at least. she watches that. assesses it.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{told me he knew. i loved him still.}
<A>__{sips at her second drink. slides the rest of it down.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{okay. now i'm drunk enough. to talk about petal.}
<A>__{her eyes ask. are you?}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{you're thinking we're kindred souls, you and me. in love with our nightmares.}
<A>__{shakes her head. uh uh.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{you don't love your petal. you hate. her cheating. guts.}
<A>__{means those words as an opening blow. jacks or better. here comes the hole card...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{you have to think it's love. because if it's not, you're dead inside. so you keep that flame a flickering. cos it's all you'll ever have.}
<A>__{pure contempt. and honesty.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{you see. you're a good liar, too.}
<A>__{lifts the cap. screws it back on the bottle.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{where's the damn eggshells? that's all i came to see.}
<A>__{and from his prison of shock and shame. he points to a shelf. she is off his desk, like a panther... ...snatches the tiny padded box with its treasure. raises it high to smash it, and... ...stops. to see the panic. in his eyes. it brings tears. pooling in hers. and she sets the treasure down, with the tenderness that decency requires.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{can you guess how i know about petal?}
<A>__{he cannot.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{because you and i. are kindred souls. after all.}
<A>__{and that. is what she came to say.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{so i told my husband. to fuck himself. and the ego he rode in on.}
<A>__{she crosses the floor. scoops up her coat. walks, just a little wobbly, to the door. sighs.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{thanks for the mirror.}
<A>__{nods. means that.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{if i don't see you. happy new year.}
<A>__{and leaves. the door closes quietly. quoyle looks from it. to the eggshells. and back.}
