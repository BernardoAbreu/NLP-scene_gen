<L>__{exterior camp day}
<A>__{the conscripts break camp. hot work. glistening with sweat, the postman stops to stretch. across the way, he sees bandit #20 talking to getty. getty glances at the postman who returns to work, watches under his eyebrows as idaho joins the group. there's trouble brewing here. worried, the postman looks to woody, who watches the exchange as well. he is, as usual, inscrutable.}
<L>__{exterior clearing river day}
<A>__{the river is swollen and swift from the spring thaw. marching along the east ridge above it, the army is given the order to halt. the postman looks ahead to where idaho confers with bethlehem. something's wrong. they look to where: two carbine toting soldiers stand alertly at guard by a thicket across the river. a rotten wood and rope bridge spans the space between the ridges. idaho rides to the conscripts:}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{one of you dogs has earned himself a treat. over there.}
<A>__{idaho points to the thicket as he proceeds down the line.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{those men hunted themselves a lion this morning. must've been a zoo around here before the war. anyhow, they shot him and he crawled into that thicket. a third man went in after him. we don't know if he's dead or alive. i need a volunteer. someone's gotta go in and get our boy out.}
<A>__{no volunteers, except the zealot bandit #20.}
<D>__{bandit #20 i will go.}
<A>__{idaho ignores him, stops in front of woody.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{i guess size ain't a measure of courage, is it? shakespeare!}
<A>__{the fix is in. the postman steps out of line. idaho's about to hand the postman a carbine when }
<C>__{bethlehem }
<D>__{i don't think so, captain.}
<A>__{bethlehem nods to getty. getty takes a hunting knife from a belt sheath and tosses it, blade first, into the ground between the postman's feet.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{come out alive and you got yourself a lion steak.}
<A>__{hefting the knife, the postman stares at the west ridge.}
<C>__{idaho}
<P>__{(winks)}
<D>__{maybe you'll find your st. rose up there.}
<A>__{the postman looks to bandit #20 who stares back defiantly.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{what are you waiting for, christmas?}
<A>__{bandit #20 can't contain his giggling, so idaho backhands the sound out of him then looks back to the postman. grim the postman starts forward, looks from the rotten bridge to the water and back again as he moves. all eyes on him as he starts across...}
