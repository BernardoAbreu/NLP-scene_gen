<A>__{close on a pendant; the symbol of the brothers. we pull out to reveal steph, very sick now. edgar is has her wrapped in a sheet and is half carrying her along a decrepit alley. ahead of him is a street; we can see several passersby. edgar sits steph up against the wall of the alley, propped up. she really is sick. she coughs. edgar looks at her for a moment. then after consideration, takes her hands and crosses them, and places an envelope in her limp hands. happy with the composition he moves off. cut to a close high angle on steph looking up, her bloodshot, dazed eyes staring blankly. we drift up and away from her. already the rats are beginning to come out and sniff her.}
