<L>__{interior recording studio that night}
<A>__{in the vocal booth, jim is chugging on a brown paper bag with whiskey in it, crooning with heart but the voice is warped, weak.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what was that promise you made why don't you tell me what she said what was that promise that she made i'm gonna love you till the heaven stops the rain i'm gonna love you till the stars fall from the sky for you and i...}
<A>__{various people are hanging around the studio listening a couple of hippie chicks, a burn victim w bandages, a charles manson type, a siberian husky, the tim leary type. paper bags, burgers, bottles, california rose, apple juice, hard boiled eggs. in the engineering booth. rothchild, the producer, is displeased.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(to botnick the engineer)}
<D>__{...fuckin' neanderthal primadonna is too drunk to see.}
<P>__{(cuts the music, to jim)}
<D>__{cut it... that was beautiful sweetheat, we had a technical problem, we'll take it again from the top babe whenever you're ready.}
<A>__{on the floor, the doors are depressed. densmore looking at morrison, aimlessly, nervously. krieger looking tired and beaten, takes a discreet hit on a jointerior ray scans an art book, patient.}
<C>__{densmore}
<D>__{what's his fucking problem?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(equally false)}
<D>__{paul babe.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{right here baby.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{why don't you suck a fart out of my asshole you slave driving facist motherfucker!}
<A>__{as he stalks out of the booth. raging, near incomprehensible. a small portable tv set is playing the "dean martin show" low on one end of the recording console. around the room the detritus of the time mailer's "armies of the night", the stone's "beggar's banquet", janis' "cheap thrills", traffic, the band.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{i hear the booze, i hear the smokes jim, i don't hear the voice and babe i didn't hear the song!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{so what are we going to tonight paul! 67 takes! it's stale!}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(coming in with john)}
<D>__{alright, let's try something else.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i wanna sing blues. this stuffs getting too self conscious.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{cause it's my song man?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(simultaneous, incomprehensible)}
<D>__{let's sing "rock is dead"! you're all a buncha slaves... "oh come all ye faithful."}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(hot)}
<D>__{shut up jim! i don't understand! i don't. what are ya doing! i love you like a brother, i do, but why are you fucking this up. it's a perfect radio song for chrissake! no one wants to hear the blues anymore! think like a singer, you're the only baritone crooner we got left... sinatra, elvis, crosby, you're as good as they are, but why are you fucking this up! why!}
<A>__{pause. jim's face darkening. something he sees on the television. he stops, frozen, sickly. several bimbettes are dancing around a shiny new automobile as strains of light my fire pop out.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{catchy, you sold it to a commercial?}
<A>__{ray, siddons, robbie, john, shuffling for a moment.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{for that? how much did you get for it?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{now, jim...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{siddons}
<D>__{it was $50,000. you weren't talking to us that week and we figgered you...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you figured? what the fuck is this ray?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's not like a big deal jim, the song's already been commercialized, the money was great. robbie wrote the lyrics and he didn't mind, neither did i, neither did john... we gotta get to tv.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what?... are you saying? are we the doors? one for all and all for one? do you know what you're saying to those millions of kids! "just kidding, not real". that's what you're saying.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh come on man, you think just cause you're the lead man in the band you can run the whole show.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(building intensity)}
<D>__{you think i was kidding ray?}
<P>__{(turning to john)}
<D>__{hey john, those are interesting shoes, you like those shoes?}
<A>__{pamela, looking drawn and pathetic finds this moment to walk into the studio.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(aggressive)}
<D>__{yeah i do.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{good. then do you want 50 of those shoes?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{then what do you need more money for?}
<A>__{pause. turning to ray.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm dying ray. i wasn't kidding. maybe you were. but i will tell you something, it's not about these desires you have man, or money, or these records, it's about breaking through wasn't it? you just lost something man.}
<P>__{(to all)}
<D>__{we all lost something boys. we lost something.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i don't think so jim. there's a bigger picture here.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{there sure is. in your fucking face!}
<A>__{a small smile flickers jim's face as he picks up the small tv and like a quarterback, hurls it, spinning end over end from his corner of the control room towards ray and rothchild and the doors. they dive for the floor as it smashes to bits into the wall behind the tape machines.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{just kidding...}
<P>__{(turning to pam)}
<D>__{hi pam. just watchin' some tv.}
<A>__{he seems pleased to distract his anger into her. she doesn't seem to notice anything unusual going on. the doors silent, feeling jim's rage.}
<C>__{pam}
<P>__{(pathetic)}
<D>__{i wanted you to find us jim. it meant nothing.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i know. i know.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{you don't have to torture me jim. let me make it up to you, please...}
<A>__{the others all look away embarrassed. this is certainly a moment the ordinary partner might turn away from pamela, her tears running, but her pathacy, her inability to deal with pain is precisely what moves jim the most a side of himself in her an ultimate weakness she has, he shares. as he goes to her, puts his arms gently around her.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it's alright honey, it's gonna be alright. you're my girl and that's the way it's always gonna stay.}
<C>__{pam}
<P>__{(snuggles him, zoned)}
<D>__{really...?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(ironic, to the others)}
<D>__{so, let's keep that money machine rolling. come on guys...}
<A>__{rothchild looking to botnick and to ray. but the real look, the unforgiving one, is from jim to ray who feels it. rothchild douses the lights in the studio.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{right on jimbo.}
