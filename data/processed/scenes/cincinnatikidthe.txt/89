<A>__{the kid, looking completely refreshed, is readying himself for the game. he has chosen casual, comfortable clothes, and now he collects three items to take with him: a large bottle of mouthwash, a green sun vizor, and finally, his stake. when he withdraws the money from the dresser drawer, we can see the pile has increased in size. the kid finds an envelope to put it in, and he is ready to go. he starts out but in the middle of the kitchen he stops to look at his watch. it is too early. he crosses to the stove, pours himself a cup of coffee, and sits down to drink it.}
