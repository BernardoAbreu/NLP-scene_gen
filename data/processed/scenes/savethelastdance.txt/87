<A>__{the equivalent of d.c.'s kennedy center, the hall is awash in lights and activity. men and women are donned in formal attire. parking valets hover on the sidewalks waiting for cars. into this, sara and patrick walk. she looks at the crowd, then sees the overhead banner "boston ballet, a command performance." sara's heart stops. her feet freeze. patrick looks at her. she looks positively catatonic.}

<D>__{surprise... sara?}

<D>__{you have to go in. this is where i'm bringing you. the ballet.}
<C>__{sara}

<D>__{i know, but }
<C>__{patrick}
<P>__{(crestfallen)}
<D>__{but what?}
<A>__{sara looks at him, feeling bad. feeling stupid for ruining the evening. she bites her lip, shakes her head ("but nothing"). patrick takes her and they go in.}
