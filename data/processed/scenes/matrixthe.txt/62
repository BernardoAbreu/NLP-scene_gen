<L>__{interior restaurant (matrix) night}
<A>__{chamber music and the ambiance of wealth soak the room as we watch a serrated knife saw through a thick, gorgeous steak.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{that's what he said to me nine years ago.}
<A>__{the meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing red juice from the inside, that it could be a dream.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{the real world. ha, what a joke.}
<A>__{we recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{you know what real is? i will tell you what real is.}
<A>__{a fork stabs the cube of meat and we follow it up to the face of cypher.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{real is just another four letter word.}
<A>__{he laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth. the restaurant is located on the top floor of a chicago skyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu has no prices. sitting across from cypher is agent smith.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{do we have a deal, mr. reagan?}
<A>__{cypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his teeth.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{mmm, so, so fucking good.}
<A>__{smith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his mouth.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{you know, i know that this steak doesn't exist. i know when i put it in my mouth, the matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. after nine years, do you know what i've realized?}
<A>__{pausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork. he pops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef melting in his mouth.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{ignorance is bliss.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{then we have a deal?}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{i don't want to remember nothing. nothing! you understand? and i want to be rich. someone important. like an actor. you can do that, right?}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{whatever you want, mr. reagan.}
<A>__{cypher takes a deep drink of wine.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{all right. you get my body back in a power plant, reinsert me into the matrix and i will get you what you want.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{access codes to zion.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{i told you, i don't know them. but i can give you the man who does.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{morpheus.}
