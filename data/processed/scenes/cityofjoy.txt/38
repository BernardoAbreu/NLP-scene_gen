<A>__{under bridge day his head turns and his eyes look this way, that way... until out of the near silence, we hear a distant, extraordinary word...}
<C>__{child }
<D>__{daaaaaaddddddyyyyy!}
<A>__{the word catches hasari's ear. he looks into the sea of people along the river bank under the bridge.}
<C>__{child }
<D>__{daaaaaadddddddyyyy!}
<A>__{as in a dream, shambu rises up out of the sea of bodies ... and runs to his father.}
<C>__{shambu}
<D>__{daaaaadddddyyyy!}
<A>__{now, aloka, amrita, manooj appear, rising up out of the sea, ending hasari's nightmare. a warrior returning from battle, hasari engulfs the little boy.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i told you to remain where i left you! i told you to stay there!}
<C>__{manooj}
<D>__{the police came!}
<C>__{shambu}
<D>__{we said we had to meet you, but they didn't care! they were mean!}
<A>__{as before, hasari tries to engulf the rest of his family in the protectorate of his arms. in the b.g., arun and his family.}
<C>__{aloka}
<D>__{these friends have found space. they will share with us.}
<A>__{hasari looks at the tiny space. the roof is cardboard and cloth and half an old movie poster featuring the actor kumar kapur. hasari looks at his tiny bit of food, debates a moment... then puts his hands together, addresses these generous people.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i would be proud if you would share our food with us.}
<A>__{everyone looks at the food; there is no disguising their hunger.}
