<L>__{interior doctor's office day}
<A>__{wills sits across from a large desk, beneath a wall of framed certificates and diplomas. the door opens and dr. paul sibley,}
<L>__{60, african american, dour and forbidding, enters }
<C>__{sibley}
<D>__{mr. keane? dr. sibley.}
<A>__{wills jerks to his feet and they shake hands }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{thank you so much for taking the time.}
<C>__{sibley}
<D>__{it's my job, sir. please, sit down.}
<A>__{he walks around the desk. sibley is all business, but his brusqueness masks genuine regret }
<C>__{sibley}
<D>__{now, mr. keane, on the phone you referred to charlotte's condition as cancer. that isn't strictly accurate. neuroblastoma is a soft tissue malignancy, but it isn't cancer although it sometimes can be just as aggressive.}
<P>__{(sitting)}
<D>__{it's most common in children. in young adults, the condition is extremely rare. in charlotte's case, the tumor is located in her chest. it's growing rapidly and has proved resistant to both irradiation and chemotherapy. and because of its proximity to her aorta, surgery is out of the question.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{so then what treatment is she getting?}
<C>__{sibley}
<D>__{at present? nothing.}
<A>__{wills shifts uneasily in his chair.}
<C>__{sibley}
<D>__{eventually she'll be treated for pain. in the end, surgery could become an option, but her chances of survival would be slim. right now charlotte's against it. she's signed a directive forbidding any sort of heroic intervention.}
<A>__{a silence settles between them. sibley opens a folder on his desk.}
<C>__{sibley}
<D>__{there's more here if you're interested, but it won't mean much to you.}
<A>__{wills shakes his head and rises from his chair. he turns to the door, then turns back to the doctor }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{how long?}
<C>__{sibley}
<D>__{optimistically? a year.}
