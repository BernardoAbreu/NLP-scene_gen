<L>__{interior pyramid core chamber day}
<A>__{watts and holloway, in space suits, arrive on the scene: powerful floodlights illuminate the core chamber, beating back the gloom. a fine spray of water falls out of the darkness overhead. david, chance, and ravel are dismantling the hulking mechanism at the core of the pyramid peeling its thick skin away with power saws and compact explosives. david operates a diamond bladed hull saw, carving away the terraforming systems thick skin. robotic scanners take high resolution scans of the machinery. two weyland security soldiers card and ray stand guard in combat vacuum suits. automatic rifles at the ready. watts takes in the destruction with dismay. beside her, holloway is all but gnashing his teeth.}
<C>__{catacombs}
<A>__{janek drives a cargo rover carrying a search party, flashlight beams sweeping: stillwell, glasse, downs, and brick. janek studies an electronic map as he drives.}
<C>__{glasse}
<P>__{(into comm)}
<D>__{milburn. fifield. you read me? come back.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{we should be getting beacons off their suits.}
<C>__{stillwell}
<D>__{shielding in the walls?}
<C>__{brick}
<D>__{suits could have failed.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{both suits?}
<A>__{pyramid core chamber watts watches in rage as a large section of the central mechanism's falls with a thunderous clamor to the deck. holloway touches her shoulder. motions for her to follow.}
<C>__{lower passage}
<A>__{holloway and watts pass the dead engineers they discovered the previous day.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{we found the tomb of the gods, and brought grave robbers right to the door.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{let them scratch. this find's too big to ruin. there's two dozen pyramids on this moon. anyway, they're on the wrong track. that's infrastructure.}
<A>__{holloway plays his flashlight over the biomechanical apparatuses lining the walls.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{the core activity of the complex was down here.}
<A>__{they turn a corner. dead engineers lie scattered over the floor in front of them. desiccated and skeletal. long dead. watts moves among them, fascinated. these engineers all died of explosive chest wounds: ribs bent outward from within. they are otherwise unmarked. holloway's more interested in the mechanisms: high tech iron maidens, built to fit the bodies of giants. some suggest sitting positions, others standing. their design is invasive: meant not merely to embrace, but to penetrate, to fuse.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{something different killed these.}
<C>__{shadowy colonnade}
<A>__{watts and holloway explore a wide colonnade. she is still distracted by the ancient dead; he by the machinery. holloway walks down a narrow branching hall. so intent on the mechanisms in the walls, he almost doesn't see the airshaft plunging down into darkness in front of him. he stops just in time. turns back... a ghost appears right in front of him a giant dragging himself across the floor, his monstrous visage eye to eye with holloway and looming closer. holloway leaps back with a gasp and falls down the shaft. the ghost stares after him as if watching his fall. disappears in a puff of static. watts crosses down the main colonnade, searching.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{martin? martin!}
<A>__{an iris door closes over the shaft.}
<C>__{colonnade}
<A>__{searching, watts walks anxiously through the dark, sweeping with her light. shouting for holloway. she breaks into a run. catacombs milburn's resting place janek and stillwell stand aghast. their flashlights illuminate a hideous sight: milburn lies dead on the deck. his body contorted in agony. his head inside his helmet is gnawed down to the bone.}
<C>__{stillwell}
<D>__{what happened to him?}
<A>__{stillwell removes the dead man's helmet. the centipede scuttles out onto the deck: doubled in size. stillwell leaps back with a cry. janek pulls his pistol. puts three rounds through the bug. it dies in a spray of acid that burns holes in the black floor. janek watches in astonishment as a pin prick dot of acid eats a pit in his gunbarrel.}
<C>__{downs }
<D>__{captain.}
<A>__{downs approaches, holding pieces of a shattered helmet: the stencilled lettering on the helmet reads fifield. janek's jaw clenches grimly. his voice is resigned:}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{where's the rest of him?}
<C>__{downs}
<D>__{no sign.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{all right. we're done here. all hands back aboard.}
<C>__{stillwell}
<D>__{what about milburn?}
<A>__{they look down at the ravaged corpse.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{we can't bring the body aboard. god knows what's in there. bag him. we'll put him in an ore hopper.}
