<L>__{83 rue du divan blockade. outside. evening.}
<A>__{at the rue du divan blockade, there is an incoherent, monotonous, and irritating chant. there is a blind beggar. he is light complexioned, tall and thin, his beard long, his arms stretched out, a cane in his hand. he arrives at last at the entrance ramp, tries to find the way, but cannot. he tries again and again with his cane, continually repeating his sorrowful chant, until a policeman takes him by his free hand, placing the hand roughly on the metal screen.}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{go on! go on!}
<A>__{the beggar protests and waves his cane in a way that the policeman has to duck to prevent himself from being hit. the policeman curses, spitefully, coarsely. a soldier starts to laugh. the old man takes up his chant again, and moves forward leaning on the metal screen. on the other side of the blockade, behind the square, there is a group of veiled girls who have seen the old man, and seem to be waiting for him. two of them go to meet him, and each one takes one of his arms. at the touch of their hands, the old man is again infuriated. even the girls laugh. then, one of them speaks to him slowly in a loud voice. it seems that the old man has understood. he is convinced. he mumbles something kindly and lets them accompany him.}
