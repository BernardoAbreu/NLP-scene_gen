<LOC>__{INT. DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{It is not a large room and jammed with tables, mostly for four but some for six and eight. A long table of honor, for about thirty people, has been placed upon a dais. Diner is over. Demi-tasses, cigars and brandy. The overall effect is one of worn elegance and dogged gentility. It is June. The CAMERA, as it has been throughout the CREDIT TITLES, is on the SARAH SIDDONS AWARD. It is a gold statuette, about a foot high, of Sarah Siddons as The Tragic Muse. Exquisitely framed in a nest of flowers, it rests on a miniature altar in the center of the table of honor. Over this we hear the crisp, cultured, precise VOICE of ADDISON deWITT:}

<DIAL>__{The Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement is perhaps unknown to you. It has been spared the sensational and commercial publicity that attends such questionable "honors" as the Pulitzer Prize and those awards presented annually by the film society...}

<DIAL>__{The distinguished looking gentleman is an extremely old actor. Being an actor - he will go on speaking for some time. It is not important what you hear what he says.}

<CHAR>__{ADDISON'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{However it is important that you know where you are, and why you are here. This is the dining room of the Sarah Siddons Society. The occasion is its annual banquet and presentation of the highest honor our Theater knows - the Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement.}
<ACTION>__{A GROUP OF WAITERS are clustered near the screen masking the entrances of the kitchen. The screens are papered with old theatrical programs. The waiters are all aged and venerable. They look respectfully toward the speaker.}
<CHAR>__{ADDISON'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{These hollowed walls, indeed many of these faces, have looked upon Modjeska, Ada Rehan and Minnie Fiske; Mansfield's voice filled the room, Booth breathed this air. It is unlikely that the windows have been opened since his death.}
<ACTION>__{CLOSE - THE AWARD on its altar, it shines proudly above five or six smaller altars which surround it and which are now empty.}
<CHAR>__{ADDISON'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The minor awards, as you can see, have already been presented. Minor awards are for such as the writer and director - since their function is merely to construct a tower so that the world can applaud a light which flashes on top of it and no brighter light has ever dazzled the eye than Eve Harrington. Eve... but more of Eve, later. All about Eve, in fact.}
<ACTION>__{THE CAMERA MOVES TO: CLOSE - ADDISON deWITT, not young, not unattractive, a fastidious dresser, sharp of eye and merciless of tongue. An omnipresent cigarette holder projects from his mouth like the sward of D'Artagnan. He sits back in his chair, musingly, his fingers making little cannonballs out of bread crumbs. His narration covers the MOVE of the CAMERA to him:}

<DIAL>__{To those of you who do not read, attend the Theater, listen to uncensored radio programs or know anything of the world in which we live - it is perhaps necessary to introduce myself. My name is Addison deWitt. My native habitat is the Theater - in it I toil not, neither do I spin. I am a critic and commentator. I am essential to the Theater - as ants are to a picnic, as the ball weevil to a cotton field...}
<ACTION>__{He looks to his left. KAREN RICHARDS is lovely and thirtyish in an unprofessional way. She is scraping bread crumbs, spilled sugar, etc., into a pile with a spoon. Addison takes one of her bread crumbs. She smiles absently. Addison rolls the bread crumb into a cannonball.}

<ACTION>__{Karen absently pats the top of her little pile of refuse. A hand reaches in to take the spoon away. Karen looks as the CAMERA PANS with IT to MAX FABIAN. He sits at her left. He's a sad-faced man with glasses and a look of constant apprehension. He smiles apologetically and indicated a white powder with he unwraps. He pantomimes that his ulcer is snapping. Karen smiles back, returns to her doodling. Addison mashes a cigarette stub, pops it out of his holder. He eyes Max.}

<DIAL>__{There are two types of theatrical producers. One has a great many wealthy friends who will risk a tax deductible loss. This type is interested in Art.}

<ACTION>__{Max rests fitfully. He twitches. A hand reaches into the SCENE, removes a bottle of Scotch from before him. The CAMERA follows the bottle to MARGO CHANNING. She sits at Max's left, at deWitt's right. An attractive, strong face. She is childish, adult, reasonable, unreasonable - usually one when she should be the other, but always positive. She pours a stiff drink. Addison hold out the soda bottle to her. She looks at it, and at him, as if it were a tarantula and he had gone mad. He smiles and pours a glass of soda for himself.}

<ACTION>__{The entire room is galvanized into sudden and tumultuous applause. Some enthusiastic gentlemen rise to her feet... Flash bulbs start popping about halfway down the table of the Aged Actor's left... Eve rises - beautiful, radiant, poised, exquisitely gowned. She stands in simple and dignified response to the ovation. A dozen photographers skip, squat, and dart about like water bugs. Flash bulbs pop and pop and pop... THE WAITERS applaud enthusiastically... AGED ACTOR, Award in hand, he beams at her... EVE smiles sweetly to her left, then to her right... MAX has come to. He applauds lustily. ADDISON's applauding too, more discreetly. MARGO, not applauding. But you sense no deliberate slight, merely an impression that as she looks at Eve her mind is on something else... KAREN, nor is she applauding. But her gaze is similarly fixed on Eve in a strange, faraway fashion. ADDISON, still applauding, his eyes flash first at Margo and then at Karen. Then he directs them back to Eve. He smiles ever so slightly. The applause has continued unabated. EVE turns now, and moves gracefully toward the Aged Actor. She moves through applauding ladies and gentlemen; from below the flash bulbs keep popping... As she nears her goal, the Ages Actor turns to her. He holds out the award. Her hand reaches out for it. At that precise moment - with the award just beyond her fingertips - THE PICTURE HOLDS, THE ACTION STOPS. The SOUND STOPS.}
