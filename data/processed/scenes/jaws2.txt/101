<L>__{exterior ocean ed and tina's sandpiper day}
<A>__{they are alone. in the middle distance, the rest of the kids' sails can be seen, headed for the lighthouse in the distance. the sandpiper's sails are luffing, they're making no headway.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{you want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(snuggling close)}
<D>__{just like this.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{what about sailing?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{the tide's running. it'll take us to the light.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{it'll take us to budapest if you're not careful.}
<A>__{ed is lashing the rudder as they continue to drift with the current.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{first things first.}
<A>__{he fumbles in a cooler chest, produces a bottle of wine.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{what about the others?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{they'll be there when we get there. might even have a fire started.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{what're we going to do in the mean time?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i dunno. we'll think of something.}
<A>__{he pours the wine into the two paper cups.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{but first, a little juice...}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{and second?}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(kissing her)}
<D>__{mmmmmm.}
<C>__{tina}
<P>__{(resisting)}
<D>__{wait a minute. promise me something.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{anything. anything.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{that you'll put down a blanket. i've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my mom's getting uptight about them.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you got it.}
<A>__{and he fumbles for a blanket in a locker, thumping and banging gear around as he rummages for it. tina sips wine contentedly, satisfied to wait.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{the sandpiper's hull, alone above us, as the shark rises with dreadful certainty, attracted by the erratic sounds of ed's hasty search. angle on tina watching the ocean the terrible fin breaks the surface, about 20 yards out, then dips and disappears. then, impossibly fast, the entire sandpiper is lifted from underneath by a powerful surge, as the shark lunges up against it from below, an unseen horror. ed is knocked over the side, into the water.}
<B>__{angle on ed}
<A>__{as he breaks the surface, shaking the hair out of his eyes, trying to orient himself, finding the boat. he starts to swim for it, tina extending an arm to help him climb aboard. angle over the gunwale, towards ed he has barely taken two strokes when a powerful force takes him from below the surface, rushing him towards us through the water. tina screams. before ed can react to the pain, he is slammed face first into the boat. his jaw breaks, blood smears his nose and lip. his hands grab the wooden cap rail with a death grip.}
<B>__{reverse}
<A>__{tina is staring down at the water, terror stricken; ed's arms and head are f.g., as he locks onto the boat with desperate hands.}
<B>__{insert}
<A>__{ed's hands on the rail, knuckles white, an iron grip. with awful finality, the force pulls down, and the wood shatters and splits away as ed's hands are pulled down and under by the awful force.}
<B>__{tina}
<A>__{her mouth working silently, unable to scream, staring down at the blood and froth on the water, swirling in a grim eddy under her, the sandpiper rocking gently in the diminishing swell.}
