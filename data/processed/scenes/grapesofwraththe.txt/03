<D>__{don't matter. just got to go an' keep a goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.}
<A>__{the truck is rattling along the highway. next, it is day, and the truck is still churning along. in the front seat, tom is driving, his cap pulled as far down as possible over his wounded cheek. rosasharn has taken pa's place and is leaning wearily against ma's shoulder.}
<C>__{rosasharn}
<D>__{ma... you know, if connie was here i wouldn't min' any a this.}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{i know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled al's gonna set out an' look for him. how 'bout gas, tommy?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{full up. uncle john come through with five bucks he been hol'in' out on us since we lef' home.}
<A>__{the truck keeps moving along. then it is night, and the truck is still making distance. on a country road, in grey dawn, with a deafening clank under the hood, the joad truck pulls to a stop off the side of the road. al is driving. asleep in tom's arm in the front seat, ma stirs awake as al turns off the ignition and gets out. he lifts the hood.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{she's hotter'n a heifer.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{fan belt's shot.}
<A>__{he pulls out the pieces. tom gets out and takes off the radiator cap. there is a geyser of steam. in the back of the truck the others stand looking on, sleepy eyed.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{picks a nice place for it, too, don't she?}
<A>__{they all look around. at first they find nothing in sight. al and tom look at each other in disgust.}

<C>__{ma}
<P>__{(as they get back in)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{don't know but it's better'n this.}
<A>__{as al starts the truck, the scene dissolves to a weather beaten wooden sign: "permanent camp no. 9" "dept. of agriculture" we see the gate to the government camp, a wide gate in a high wire fence, with a caretaker's shack to one side of the gate. the caretaker stands beside his shack as the joad truck swings off the road, hits an unnoticed rut that bounces the whole truck off the ground, and stops.}
<C>__{caretaker}
<P>__{(mildly)}
<D>__{you hit 'er too fast.}
<A>__{in the front seat al leans angrily out of the driver's window. tom is keeping his face away from the caretaker's line of vision.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{what's the idea of that?}
<C>__{caretaker}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{well, a lot a kids play in here. you tell folks to go slow and they liable to forget. but let 'em hit that hump once and they don't forget!}
<A>__{al starts climbing out. pa jumps down from the truck.}

<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{no. no cops. folks here elect their own cops.}
<P>__{(to ma)}
<D>__{the ladies' committee'll call on you, ma'am, about the kids and the sanitary unit and who takes care of 'em.}
<P>__{(to al)}
<D>__{come inside and sign up.}
<A>__{as ma, pa, and al look at each other in almost incredulous bewilderment, tom climbs out of the truck.}

<P>__{shack)}
<A>__{inside the shack, tom enters warily, alert for any indication that either his name or his scar may have been learned and telegraphed here. but the caretaker obviously attaches no significance to either. the shack is bare but for a cot, a table, a chair, and an electric light. the caretaker is seated at the table, pen in hand, a soiled ledger open, when tom enters.}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{i don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. i just got to have certain information. what's your name?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(watching him)}

<C>__{caretaker}
<P>__{(writing)}
<D>__{how many of you?}
<A>__{the joad truck is seen in front of its camp site as the joads descend.}

<C>__{ma}
<D>__{you don't look so good.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i ain't so good, but i'm a comin'.}
<A>__{inside the caretaker's shack:}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean stuff like that.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{we'll work it out. what's this committee you talkin' about?}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{we got five sanitary units. each one elects a central committee man. they make the laws, an' what they say goes.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas campin' here?}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{that's the way it is.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{an' you say no cops?}
<C>__{caretaker}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{no cop can come in here without a warrant.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(marveling)}
<D>__{i can't hardly believe it. camp i was in once, they burned it out the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{they don't get in here. sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you got dances too?}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{we got the best dances in the county every saturday night.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{say, who runs this place?}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{government.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{why ain't they more like it?}
<C>__{caretaker}
<P>__{(shortly)}
<D>__{you find out, i can't.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{anything like work aroun' here?}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(leaving)}
<D>__{ma's shore gonna like it here. she ain't been treated decent for a long time.}
<C>__{caretaker}
<P>__{(as tom is at the door)}
<D>__{that cut you got?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{crate fell on me.}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{better take care of it. store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. goodnight.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<A>__{as he exits we see the government camp, with tom coming out of the shack, amazement still on his face. as he walks slowly down the main camp street we share the revelation of the place to him. it is nearly daylight. roosters crow in the distance. the street is neat and orderly in a military way, its cleanliness in sharp contrast to anything he has known before. inside the tents people are stirring. in front of one tent a woman is cooking breakfast. a baby is in her arms.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{good mornin'.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{mornin'.}
<A>__{as he walks on, tom draws a breath of exultation. as he moves on, looking around, we see the exterior of sanitary unit no.}
