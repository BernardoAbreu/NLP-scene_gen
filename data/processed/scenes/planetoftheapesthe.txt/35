<A>__{dodge moves inland about ten yards, removes a small hand drill from his belt, extends the rod of the drill three feet and begins to take some subsoil samplings. taylor begins to examine the contents of the three rucksacks. landon sits down on the beach., hands around his knees, gazing moodily at the sunken spaceship. during this and succeeding scenes we sense that dodge's obsession with scientific inquiry leaves him immune to fear: landon is possibly more courageous and certainly more "human," for he has many fears to control: while taylor detached, cool and misanthropic is something of an enigma.}
