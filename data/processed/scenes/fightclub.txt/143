<L>__{interior lou's tavern basement night}
<A>__{loud. an enormous crowd of guys, including jack and bob, stands around tyler, who's in the center of the circle, holding up his hands to quiet them...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{i look around... i look around and see a lot of new faces.}
<A>__{an enthusiastic rumble from the crowd.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{shut up! which means a lot of you have been breaking the first two rules of fight club.}
<A>__{a glum silence falls. guys look at each other.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{i see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who have ever lived an entire generation pumping gas and waiting tables; or they're slaves with white collars.}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{tyler }
<D>__{advertisements have them chasing cars and clothes, working jobs they hate so they can buy shit they don't need. we are the middle children of history, with no purpose or place. we have no great war, or great depression. the great war is a spiritual war. the great depression is our lives. we were raised by television to believe that we'd be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars but we won't. and we're learning that fact. and we're very, very pissed off.}
<A>__{the crowd erupts into a deafening chorus of agreement. jack looks at the blazing excitement in the eyes of the crowd.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{we are the quiet young men who listen until it's time to decide.}
<A>__{a fat, middle aged man stomps down the stairs, pushing into the crowd, followed by a tall, hefty thug who holds a gum.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{fat man }
<D>__{who am i?! there's a sign on the front that says "lou's tavern." i'm fucking lou. who the fuck are you?!}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{tyler durden.}
<A>__{tyler extends his hand for a shake, but lou slaps it away.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{we have a deal worked out with irvine.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{irvine? irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.}
<A>__{everyone glances guiltily at each other.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{he don't own this place, i do. how much money's he getting for this?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{there is no money.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{it's free to all.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{ain't that something?}

<D>__{you're welcome to join our club.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{did you hear what i just said?!}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you and your friend.}
<A>__{lou slugs tyler in the stomach, doubles him over.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{you hear me now?}
<A>__{tyler gains his breath, determined. he looks up, turns his head, looking to jack. jack watches, wide eyed. tyler straightens, facing lou.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{no, i'm sorry, i didn't hear you.}
<A>__{lou punches tyler in the face. some of the guys move forward, but the thug points his gun. jack runs forward anyway lou punches him in the face. more guys move forward, but tyler waves them off, facing lou.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{we really need to use this place.}
<A>__{lou proceeds to beat the shit out of tyler, punching his face, his stomach. tyler collapses to the floor. lou starts kicking his. tyler bleeds from the mouth and face.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{that's it.... that's good. get it all out. you'll feel better.}
<A>__{lou flushes red with exasperation, kicks more. finally, sweating, bewildered, lou stops. he looks to the thug, who is just as bewildered. suddenly, tyler springs up, grabs onto lou...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{yes, i am shit and crazy, to you and this whole fucking world...}
<A>__{tyler's blood spatters on lou. lou tries to shake tyler off, but tyler bites lou's necktie. the thug grabs tyler and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling lou. lou slaps at tyler's face, but recoils from the blood. tyler spits and shouts through clenched teeth...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you don't know where i've been.}
<A>__{tyler bear hugs lou, pulls him to the floor. tyler rubs his bloody face into lou's face. the thug lifts tyler. tyler clings to lou's belt, dragging lou as he is dragged...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{we need this place. we need it. please let us keep it, please...}
<A>__{blood dribbles out of tyler's mouth, spattering lou.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{pleeeeeease!}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{okay! okay, fuck it! use the basement! get off me!}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{we need some towels, lou. we need replacement light bulbs.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{alright, christ! fucking let me go!}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{thank you. thank you, sir...}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{let go of me!!}
<A>__{tyler lets go of lou's belt. lou scrambles away. the thug drops tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood. lou gets to his feet, looks at tyler, then at the rest of the guys. he and the thug back away... slamming the door behind. fight club surrounds tyler. they help him up, move him to a crate. tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his breathing labored... then, he sits back, crossing his legs and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{this week, each of you has a homework assignment. you're going to go out and start a fight with a total stranger...}
<P>__{(pause, drooling blood)}
<D>__{you're going to start a fight... and you're going to lose.}
<A>__{jack beams in appreciation.}
