<L>__{exterior university campus day}
<A>__{lush, pastoral green. we see peter sitting by himself. he wears a white lab coat, like one we saw hanging in his basement. his pov: of students on the green, playing frisbee, studying together, picnicking. women sunbathe, their straps pulled down on their shoulders, their tops rolled up to expose their midriffs.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{'first you make a stone of your heart.'... oh yes!}
<A>__{he doesn't}
<D>__{suffer. that's past. now it's our turn.}
<A>__{one of the sunbathing girls sits up and looks round, then takes her top off entirely.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{kemper said in order to have the experience he wanted with them, he needed to evict them from their bodies. by making the body a completely passive object, he releases himself from passivity.}
<A>__{close: helen, deep in thought...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{but the relief he feels is only temporary. '...before your conscience bothers you much less...' but the tension always comes back.}
<P>__{(she now picks out the words:)}
<D>__{'you can join the ranks of the illustrious...' he wants to be like them . the best. to become the best. but, he has his own desires, his own compulsions apart from theirs.' his own horrors...}
