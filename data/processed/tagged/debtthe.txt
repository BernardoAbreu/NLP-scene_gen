<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{rachel nods and they change places. david picks up the knife and repeats the "attack" move on her. she disarms him easily.}
<C>__{stephan }
<D>__{now an attack from behind.}
<A>__{david takes his position, grabbing rachel from behind, but he's so awkward with her the attack seems a little tentative. stephan talks as rachel practises breaking free from the hold.}
