<L>__{interior mill's apartment, living room night}
<A>__{mills stands brooding over a photocopy of the picture of the woman with her eyes circled in blood. he looks overworked, drinks coffee. his desk is swamped with files.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{i have voiced the same concerns to our law enforcement officials, and they assure me he is of the highest caliber.}
<A>__{mills looks to a t.v. on a table, picks up a remote, increases the volume. on the screen, martin talbot, 47, source of the voice, stands before reporters. he's a powerful presence, with a gold tooth in the front of his mouth.}
<C>__{a reporter }
<P>__{(from t.v.)}
<D>__{as district attorney, don't you feel some responsibility? detective david mills lacks the experience...}
<C>__{talbot }
<P>__{(from t.v.)}
<D>__{i've always said... i've always said, don't send a boy to do a man's job.}
<A>__{mills is hanging on every word.}
<P>__{talbot (v.o.,cont)}
<D>__{but, david mills has a sterling record with the philadelphia force. i stand behind him one hundred percent.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{you tell 'em boss. detective david mills is a wonderful human being...}
<C>__{talbot }
<D>__{however... however... let me say this...}
<A>__{mills looks back at the television.}
<P>__{talbot (v.o.,cont)}
<D>__{if detective mills, at any point in this investigation... if he is not pulling his weight, i will be the first in line to pull his plug.}
<A>__{mills points the remote, turns the t.v. off as reporters crowd talbot. mills stares at the blank screen, dispirited. across the room, tracy stands in the doorway. mills does not see her. he looks at the photocopy and sits at his desk. tracy watches him, great concern in her sad eyes.}
