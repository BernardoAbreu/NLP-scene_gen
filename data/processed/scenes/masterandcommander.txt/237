<T>__{fade to black: fade up on:}
<L>__{235. stephen's tent day}
<A>__{through a gap in the door of his tent stephen can see the distant ship at anchor. repairs are underway, guns being unloaded, stores and fresh water being ferried aboard. blakeney comes in, followed by padeen with a some numbered boxes hung round his neck.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{my goodness, what is this?}
<A>__{blakeney starts rolling up the sides of the tent as padeen unloads his boxes, each with a beetle and a piece of vegetation in it.}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{well sir, padeen and i have been doing some collecting for you. the beetles each come with a specimen of plant they were found on. ooops. catch him, padeen! there he goes.}
<A>__{he finishes rolling up the tent sides to reveal a collection of cages, with native wildfowl in them, being fed by the poulterer, jemmy ducks.}
<C>__{blakeney }
<D>__{the birds were snared by jemmy ducks. captain says we can keep them in the chicken coop.}
<A>__{then, producing a notebook }
<C>__{blakeney }
<D>__{and i made a few notes if you want to see them.}
<A>__{stephen flips the pages: no 22. large square black beetle with pincers. found under rock. eats earthworms.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{'pon my word you have the makings of a true naturalist.}
<A>__{blakeney is flattered but unsure.}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{well sir, perhaps i could combine them, and be a kind of fighting naturalist, like yourself?}
<A>__{stephen smiles at this description as he levers himself into a sitting position.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{shall we take a tour of your aviary?}
<A>__{blakeney looks doubtfully at the doctor's bandaged abdomen.}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{should you really be up?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{yes. padeen!}
<A>__{padeen puts the escaped beetle in his mouth for safe keeping and offers stephen a hand. stephen pulls himself painfully to his feet and starts buttoning his shirt.}
<C>__{stephen }
<P>__{(to blakeney)}
<D>__{how long does the captain intend that we stay here, do you know?}
<A>__{on the beach day jack is watching those of the crew not on duty play cricket on the shore, with a canvas ball and stumps made of driftwood.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, a week perhaps. there is no great hurry.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{but surely, we must make haste for the marquesas?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it may not have been the acheron that we sighted. nor can we be sure of her destination.}
<P>__{(looks away)}
<D>__{no, i think we shall go home now, before peace breaks out with france, god forbid.}
<A>__{he's making light of what has been a huge and far reaching decision.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{but how will it sit with the admiralty? to have spent six months in a fruitless pursuit and then come home empty handed?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{"empty handed"? not a bit of it. what about these plants and animals which blakeney has been collecting? the british museum will need an entire new wing for 'em.}
<A>__{stephen regards him gravely, shaking his head.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i fear, jack, you have burdened me with a debt i can never repay.}
<A>__{he is absolutely sincere about this, to jack's great embarrassment.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{tosh. name a shrub after me. something prickly and hard to eradicate.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{a shrub? i shall name a giant tortoise: testudo aubreii!}
