<L>__{interior hospital corridor night}
<A>__{sam is still wet as he walks down the hall. we hear more of the warren zevon song. 'i had a dream ah, shucks, oh, well now it's all fucked up it's shot to hell.'}
<L>__{interior george's hospital room night}
<A>__{sam enters the room as a nurse scurries to catch up.}
<C>__{nur}
<D>__{i'm afraid no one's allowed in here now.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he's my dad.}
<A>__{sam is staring at george, who is either asleep or unconscious. the nurse finally relents and walks out. sam sits in a chair beside the bed and begins to cry. slowly, george's arm slides out beyond the railing of the bed, his hand open. sam does his best to stop crying.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i brought you something.}
<A>__{sam pulls out a pair of sunglasses from his shirt pocket. george shakes death and drugs away as he manages to open his eyes.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{i don't wanna go, sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{sam gently slides the sunglasses over his father's eyes; he rushes to the window and pulls the curtains back.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{can you see?}
<A>__{sam walks back to the bed and pulls it toward the window, stretching the cords and tubes to their limit. he grabs the remote and raises george's head. off in the distance, against the backdrop of an endless black ocean, george's house is seemingly on fire with lights. pain can't stop a smile.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{it's almost done.}
<A>__{george takes hold of sam's hand with his own. they continue to stare at the lit house holding hands.}
