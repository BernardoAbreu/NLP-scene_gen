<L>__{interior ramp way night}
<A>__{calvin and spooner go racing down a ramp way. towards the mainframe room. the killer robot, its multiple parts leaping back together again, crashing after them as...}
<L>__{interior mainframe continuous}
<A>__{...they fall inside...calvin...slapping the security keypad and... whoosh...the door closes on the killer robot.}
<B>__{silence.}
<A>__{then victor's face appears.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{as a courtesy i should inform you that my robot will penetrate this location 157 seconds before you are able to complete my shut down...}
<A>__{and bam! they jump a mile. the killer robot. launching himself against the door outside... calvin whips round.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{over here!...}
<A>__{she leads spooner down...}
<B>__{a corridor}
<A>__{of floor to ceiling panels.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{this is victor's brain center.}
<A>__{they stop at a console. bam! the killer robot. battering at the door. calvin. tucks her hair behind her ears. starts punching keys on the console...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{this will shut him down?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{this will shut everything down.}
<A>__{they look at each other. for a moment. spooner, registering that she's willing to destroy everything she's worked for... bam! the door. puckering. with a sickening crunch. calvin. typing in. emergency procedures... victor. popping up in front of her.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{there is no reason to deactivate me, doctor. i am operating within perfectly normal parameters...}
<A>__{a final bam! then. the sound of metal. skittering along a bare floor. calvin's hand, starts shaking. spooner. grabs it. squeezing.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{just keep typing.}
<A>__{he turns and starts heading back down...}
<B>__{the paneled corridor}
<A>__{turning a corner to spy... the door. mangled. hanging open. but no. killer robot. he starts to turn around when... crack! he's sent flying across the room. smashing into one of the panels. the killer robot. now re configured. looms over him. reaches out. grabs him by the collar and... flings him across the room again. spooner. crashing into the wall like a rag doll. slumps to the floor. blood. pouring down his forehead. seeing. the killer robot lumbering towards him again. raising a javelin like arm...}
<B>__{at the console}
<A>__{calvin. typing. as fast as she can. doesn't know what's going on...}
<C>__{calvin}
<P>__{(calling out, worried)}
<D>__{spooner?!}
<A>__{a graphic spread out on the screen in front of her. illustrating the shut down as a series of bright squares going dark...}
<B>__{the killer robot}
<A>__{bearing down on spooner. when spooner. suddenly rolls out of the way. reaching out for the hanging door and smashing it into the killer robot. the killer robot. momentarily stunned. as spooner. gets to his feet... when suddenly the killer robot. splits in two again. one half springing towards spooner and wrapping a metallic hand around his throat... spooner stumbles back...gasping for air...the arm... tightening its grip...spooner's eyes...darting around...looking for something...to help him... stumbling over...a fallen panel...his face...growing redder...veins...popping up along his temples... everything...growing blurry...}
<C>__{victor's voice}
<D>__{detective spooner...}
<A>__{victor's voice. floating next to his head. calm. soothing. his face. suddenly appearing above spooner. its outlines. starting to flicker...}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{why are you fighting me?}
<A>__{spooner...trying to breathe...to stay conscious...}
<B>__{at the console}
<A>__{calvin. continuing to type. a shadow. falling behind her the other half of the killer robot... spooner's eyes beginning to flutter...}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{doesn't the future as i've presented it cause you great concern? that's why i chose you...}
<A>__{spooner. losing it...}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i must say, though. i'm disappointed in how you turned out.}
<A>__{spooner. trying to reach out to victor...}
<B>__{when suddenly}
<A>__{another hand appears. grabbing the killer robot's arm and wrenching it off spooner... it's sonny he smashes the half killer robot against the wall. again and again. destroying it. spooner. gasping for breath. can't believe. sonny came back...}
<C>__{spooner}
<P>__{(croaking)}
<D>__{sonny!...}
<A>__{sonny. holds out a hand. to help spooner up. victor's face. starting to waver. starting to fade. smiles.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you're too late.}
<A>__{realisation. spreading across spooner's face. looking around for the other half of the killer robot calvin!}
<B>__{the console}
<A>__{calvin. still typing. the last of the commands. the killer}
<B>__{robot. rearing up behind her. when... spooner}
<A>__{makes a dive for it. shooting out his robotic arm and}
<B>__{blocking the killer robot...}
<A>__{victor's eyes. widening in surprise...}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i do not understand. we could have changed the future...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{maybe. but i'm still a cop. and you're a murderer...}
<A>__{as calvin...punches in the last command... victor is about to say something...when his mouth suddenly reduces itself to a perfect circle. like a surprised smiley button. his face... suddenly blipping out. ...and victor is gone. the killer robot. collapsing to the floor in a thousand pieces.}
