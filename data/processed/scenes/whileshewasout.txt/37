<A>__{della wanders the aisles of festive colored undies watching men pick out slinky lingerie for their partners and women examine slim fit underpants and padded bras. she notices a pure silk black teddy, very classic, no frills. she lifts it from the rail and holds it against herself in front of the mirror, tries to imagine herself in it. a young sales assistant approaches.}
<C>__{vs sales assistant}
<D>__{it's pure silk, the last one in our classic black label collection. would you like me to fix you a changing room?}
<A>__{della checks the size tag. it reads 36c, two sizes too big. and the price tag next to it. ouch! it's expensive for victoria's secret.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{no thanks. not my size.}
<A>__{she gestures to her small boobs, smiles and hands the teddy to the sales assistant. she quickly leaves the shop.}
