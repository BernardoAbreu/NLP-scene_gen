<A>__{julian can't get the words out. he gets up.}
<C>__{julian }
<D>__{... i've got to go.}
<A>__{...and julian leaves letting the door to the office stay open. we pick up the sounds of the fighters training outside as we slowly zoom in on jenna. she turns to gordon.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{how's business?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{it's alright, yeah. well, what with billy not being around, it's tricky to be honest...}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{what d'you mean?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{well, we're supposed to be moving five keys out the end of this week. but billy's not here, is he?}

<C>__{jenna }
<D>__{what's gotten into him...? is he high or something?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i don't know. earlier today we had the guy... the guy that killed billy. had a gun against his face. but then nothing...}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{nothing?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{julian let him go. now there's all this stuff about angels... i don't know what the fuck's wrong with him.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{not like you...}
<A>__{gordon smiles at her uncertainly.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i know how to do what needs to be done. that's all.}
<A>__{she stares at him, long enough to make him uncomfortable.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{so tell me... what did he mean when he said it was complicated?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{there's this other guy... might have been involved...}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{so we kill them both.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{we don't know who the other guy is yet...}
<C>__{jenna}
