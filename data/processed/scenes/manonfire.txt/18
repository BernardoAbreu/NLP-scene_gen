<L>__{exterior corridor mexico city airport day}
<A>__{as a 747 is towed by in the background, a man strides at us. creasy. even in movement, he has a stillness, an air of isolation. he's set apart from other living things. he wears dark sunglasses, carries a well worn leather bag. inscrutable. disconnected. a bit frightening. the discipline of a soldier. the independence of a gunslinger. automatic baggage teller (red light, green light). creasy feeds the machine with his perforated customs card. light flashes red.}
<B>__{customs man}
<A>__{he flips through creasy's passport. even the stamps have stamps. thailand. somalia. cuba. columbia. hong kong. saudi arabia. every country in europe. guy's been around. customs looks up from the ink blue american eagle to the deep matte black of creasy's sunglasses. note: italics denotes the lines spoken in spanish.}

<D>__{i have a friend there.}
<A>__{customs looks at creasy a moment. he doesn't look like a man who has 'friends'. finally, customs smiles.}
<C>__{customs}
<D>__{i cannot see your eyes, senor.}
<A>__{creasy slips off the sunglasses. his eyes are deserted. inevitable. customs can only look into them a moment. he indicates for creasy to put his bags on a conveyor belt leading to an x ray machine. creasy lifts his bag onto the conveyor. the official hits the start button. the bag drives forward towards the x ray machine. creasy pauses, then offers up a license from his wallet.}

<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{it's a permit to carry a gun in columbia. the gun you're about to find in that suitcase.}
<A>__{polaroid flash shot of creasy straight on. shot of creasy profile. flash. fingers being fingerprinted. jumpcuts suitcase being stripped and ripped (midnight express), pack of marlboro, bottle of jack daniels, glimpse a weathered bible (new testament), intercut with seven pieces of blue steel separated in different parts of the bag, ie. toiletries, underwear, lining of suitcase. the seven pieces laid together look remarkably like a well travelled sig sauer 226. creasy smiles.}
