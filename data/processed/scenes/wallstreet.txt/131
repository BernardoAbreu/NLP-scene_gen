<A>__{a salon interior. gekko on a couch reading, with eyeglasses, a stack of financial reports. alex is on the phone, susan, and others accompanying the caravan on a business trip. bud is excited.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...bluestar's an unpolished gem, gordon, right out of the garbage. a half assed management being decimated by a price war they can't win. but the gates at laguardia alone can bail us out, it's worth 25 bucks a share if it's worth a dime! they're ripe to fall.}
<A>__{gekko, the poker player, hasn't seen enough cards.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{mixed emotions, buddy: like larry wildman going off a cliff in my new maserati. men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{yeah aren't you forgetting something gordon: rule one, capital reserves. this company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. that buys us a lot of credibility...}
<P>__{(gordon looks up, interested)}
<D>__{...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(interrupting, on the phone)}
<D>__{gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{tell those spineless toads we'll self insure if they don't write it... you fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...}
<P>__{(back to bud)}
<D>__{you eating twinkies today, bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(deadly serious)}
<D>__{gordon what i want and i never asked you for anything is to be your co pilot on this. i want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. it's gonna make us a fortune!}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{i'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. it's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn teldar paper around, what do i need this dink airline for? i'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{gordon, i worked at bluestar, i know my way around, i have friends there...inside.}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(getting the drift)}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(playing out his ace)}
<D>__{the three unions. it's 43% of bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value g.g., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350 400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since texas air...}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{what makes you think you can?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i can talk to these people gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{alright... susan, get buckingham on the box. i want him to look at it. and tell jock taylor at thwick, jensen...}
