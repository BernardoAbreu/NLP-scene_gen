<L>__{ext day: mall}
<A>__{carlo moves out to the mall; the buttonmen are putting his things in the trunk. one opens the front door for him. someone is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who. carlo gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back to see the other man. it is clemenza, who nods cordially. the motor starts, and as the car pulls away, clemenza suddenly throws the garrote around carlo's neck. he chokes and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet. the garrote is pulled tighter; carlo's face turns color. his thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield. then the body goes slack. clemenza makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car drives off.}
