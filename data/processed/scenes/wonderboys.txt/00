<C>__{based on the novel by michael chabon}
<D>__{screenplay steve kloves}
<A>__{january 21, 1999 (pink revision) january 15, 1999 (blue revision) december 18,1998 all is a blur. . . ...then words appear, twisting and vaguely transparent, reflected on the window grady tripp stands before as he reads from a sheaf of neatly typed pages.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{'the young girl sat perfectly still in the confessional...}
<L>__{interior classroom university afternoon}
<A>__{grady 45 year old novelist, professor, and insomniac is in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college students who make up his advanced writing workshop.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{...listening to her father's boots scrape like chalk on the ancient steps of the church, then grow faint, then disappear altogether.'}
<A>__{as he finishes, grady ponders a pair of maintenance men, perched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a large banner between two bare trees. the banner reads:}
<B>__{welcome to wordfest}
<A>__{grady turns, peers at his students. they look as if they've been on a field trip to the dmv.}
<C>__{grady }
<P>__{(a wave of the pages)}
<D>__{so. .anyone?}
<A>__{a girl with jet black hair turns to a pale young man sitting at a desk in the back of the classroom. he is james leer, 19. like grady a moment before, he is staring out the window.}
<C>__{carrie mcwhirty}
<D>__{let me get this straight. the girl with the big lips is depressed because, each night, when her father goes off to work at the bakery, her mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the house. not only does this girl have to listen to her mother working this guy in the next room, she has to wash the sheets each morning before daddy gets home. after a few weeks of this, she starts to go a little nutty so daddy takes her to confession only, once she gets in the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and realizes he's the mother's secret lover. is that it?}
<A>__{james leer says nothing, huddling lower in the patty overcoat he wears.}
<C>__{carrie mcwhirty}
<D>__{i mean, jesus. what is it with you catholics?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{all right. let's try to keep it constructive, shall we? howard, what about you?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{i hated it.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{that's not exactly what i meant by constructive, howard.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{i think james should try to be more constructive. this is my second semester with him. his stories are brutal, man. they make me want to kill myself.}
<A>__{grady glances at james, but his face remains impassive. then with a visible sense of relief grady notices the raised hand of the achingly beautiful hannah green.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{yes, hannah?}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{i think maybe we're missing the pointerior it seems to me james' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. he treats us like adults. he respects us enough to forget us. that takes . . . courage .}
<A>__{grady nods, smiles subtly. appreciative.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{well put, hannah. and a good note to end on, i think.}
<P>__{(as the students rise)}
<D>__{don't forget about wordfest this weekend. and remember: those of you driving v.i.p.s to tonight's cocktail party need to have them at the chancellor's house no later than 5:30.}
<A>__{hannah green gathers her things, pauses by grady.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{thanks for that. he all right?}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{i think so. ..what about you?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{me? sure. why?}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{just checking.}
<A>__{grady watches her glide away in her cracked red cowboy boots, then starts to exit himself.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{turn out the light, please.}
<A>__{grady pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back of the classroom, then reluctantly hits the switch on the wail, leaving james leer alone in the dark.}
