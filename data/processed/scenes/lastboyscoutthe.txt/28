<L>__{interior "bottomless pit" club night}
<A>__{rowdy strip club in west hollywood. just like the name suggests; if it's a virus, you're sitting on it. after three drinks, every girl on stage looks like your high school sweetheart. was your sweetheart fat? did she have excessive body hair? funk music, played loud. the monday crowd stomps and claps. onstage a stripper grinds away with an enthusiasm usually reserved for standing in line at the dmv. jimmy dix sits at the bar, hooting and whistling. behind the bar, a black man in a wheelchair serves drinks. his name is harp. off to one side, a twenty five year old beanpole speaks into a microphone:}

<A>__{the black man shakes his head.}

<D>__{my son. he writes his own material, he's proud of that. some people are proud, they cured leukemia. old guy stops beating off long enough to laugh, my son thinks he's eddie murphy.}

<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{it, man. i've had it.}
<P>__{(takes a swig)}
<D>__{i don't remember what i did last night. i'm an idiot, harp, i act like a complete dickhead. i don't have friends. i drink too much. i fuck anything that's warm and breathing.}
<C>__{harp}
<D>__{stay on that side of the bar.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{i cheated on my girl friend again.}
<C>__{harp}
<D>__{you cheated on her? you must be crazy.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{maybe so, harp. maybe so.}
<A>__{his gaze wanders across the crowded room, fixating on scantily clad waitress who makes her way between the tables. she is beautiful. stands out like a teamster at a gay rights rally. supple body. deep green eyes. flaxen hair. her name is cory. she stops at a table against the wall. puts down a seagrams v.o. in a rocks glass. seated at the table is a broad shouldered man in a bad suit. the essence of boredom. looks like he's been there three days. a cloud of smoke hangs around his head. mr. joe hallenbeck, no less.}

<D>__{the police won't help you, huh?}
<C>__{cory}
<D>__{sure. after i'm dead they'll perform the autopsy.}

<A>__{sits with his drink untouched before him. pats his suit pockets, searching for a smoke. removes a crumpled, empty pack, as:}

<D>__{shhh. don't tell anyone.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{that's what cory said. she said you were nobody.}
