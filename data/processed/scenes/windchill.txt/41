<L>__{interior stranded oldsmobile night}
<A>__{she's sitting in the driver's seat of the idling car when she hears the crunch crunch crunch of his approaching footsteps. in that moment she makes a decision. scrambles across the front seat, pulls the door shut hard.}
<L>__{interior exterior stranded oldsmobile that moment}
<A>__{he arrives at the passenger side door handle just as the power locks all go thunk. he's locked out.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{hey, open up.}
<A>__{he tugs at the handle a few times. knocks on the window.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{you wanna pop the locks?}
<A>__{when there's no response from her he puts his lips to the half inch gap at the top of the stuck window.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{you gonna unlock the door or what?}
<A>__{she sees him cup his hands and peering in through the window. she keeps her eyes down, focuses on her shaking fingers as they frantically dial her cellphone. no signal.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{hey, c'mon, it's freezing out here!}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{better get used to it, asshole.}
<A>__{he rattles the door handle, starting to get panicked now.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what the hell is wrong with you? what did i do?}
<A>__{but she's in full blown paranoid mode now, near hysterics.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{you drove us here, that's what you did!! what the hell did you think you were doing!?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i thought i was driving you home.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{you're not driving me home because one, you don't live near my home and two, this piece of shit isn't driving anywhere. now what are we doing here? why did you get off the highway?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i told you, this is a shortcut. anyway, you were the one who said she was so bored on the highway. this used to be called `scenic 606' because there's an amazing view of the valley }
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{one, you've never been anywhere near here before so don't pretend you knew it's a shortcut, and two, there's an amazing view of shit because it's pitch black out!}
<A>__{he stands there as she freaks out.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{let me get this straight. you think i intentionally arranged for us get stranded out here?! it was an}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{accident! you saw the other car. you think he was in on it, too?}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(raving)}
<D>__{maybe! maybe he's like your black pete or something! why the hell did you tell me that story anyway?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you're crazy...}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(lying)}
<D>__{anyway, i've got news for you... i got through to a friend's voicemail while you were supposedly unconscious. i'm sure she's called the cops by now.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{would you listen to yourself? what kind of psycho do you think i am?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{exactly.}
<A>__{he straightens, exasperated, puts a hand to his injured head. she looks at him standing there, hugging himself against the sub zero cold, his teeth chattering. he doesn't look like an ax murderer. she doesn't know what to do. there's a long beat. finally, he throws up his hands in disgust, decides to go to plan b.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i'm gonna walk back to the gas station for help. you've got the heater and the radio, so you should be all right here. though i really think you should consider coming with me.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i bet you do.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{fine. whatever. if you feel a draft and you want to patch this...}
<A>__{sticking his fingertips through the half inch gap at the top of the stuck passenger side window.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{... i keep duct tape in the back.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{i bet you do.}
<A>__{he looks in at her one last time, exits. she listens to the crunch of his footsteps until she can't hear them anymore. suddenly there's a loud bang against the passenger side window. she jumps.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{but it's my car!!}
<A>__{he goes crazy on the stranded olds: punching the roof, jerking the door handle, kicking the door, screaming at her the whole time. she cowers inside, scared to death. finally he gives up, and with a final bang to the roof, exits. he turns and heads back down the road. we watch through the rear window as he trudges robotically away, his boots crunch crunch crunching in the snow. he stops. leans his weight against a tree. looks back at the car. whatever it is he's doing, he's clearly not walking to the gas station. he straightens, and continues on until he's out of sight.}
