<A>__{everything in bureau 713's headquarters looks sleek and high tech. there are no windows anywhere. commander burke (late 30s) strides purposefully down the hallway. he is confident to the point of arrogance. his second in command, agent miles (mid 30s), driven and efficient, hurries to keep up.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{his better be good, miles.}
<C>__{agent miles}
<D>__{sir, we're getting some strange readings in the control room.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{his is bureau 713. "strange" doesn't even crack my radar. now what's the situation?}
<C>__{agent miles}
<D>__{well, sir, normal levels of paranormal activity range from three to five...}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{condescending)}
<D>__{yes miles. and what level are the sensors picking up now?}
<A>__{burke and miles arrive at the control room. burke nods to two bureau guards standing at the entrance.}
<C>__{agent miles}
<D>__{we don't know.}
<A>__{burke stops and looks at agent miles for the first time.}
<C>__{agent miles }
<D>__{they only go up to 50.}
<A>__{agent miles opens the door to the control room.}
