<A>__{smecker is now a complete mess. his hair is totally frazzled. he is sucking on cigarettes long and hard. his clothes are completely disheveled.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{television,... television is the explanation for this.}
<A>__{smecker points toward the ceiling revealing a huge gaping hole in it just above the living room.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{you see this is bad television.}

<D>__{the hole in the}

<D>__{the little assault guys creeping in through the vents and coming in through the ceilings. that james bond shit never happens in real life. professionals don't do that. so we've got this up here, which has novice written all over it. and all this down here that's simply a perfect textbook assassination. so here's our two possibilities. we either have rank amateurs that got lucky or consummate professionals that fucked up.}
<A>__{the detectives nod in agreement. they are now completely taken in by smecker's spell.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{join me in a drink, gentlemen.}
<A>__{they go over and grab seats at the bar. smecker mixes himself a gin and tonic on the other side. he is calming down now and going back into cool mode. he starts to tuck his clothes back in and fix his hair. he leans over the bar and sips his drink. the three detectives lean in.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{with the exception of my coffee boy, you boston detectives are starting to show signs of intelligence. so, i am going to make you privy to some information that you would not normally be. these men are all russian mob. not like those two peons in the alley the other day. these guys are all syndicate bosses and underbosses. i have a dossier on every man in this room. since the iron curtain has gone down, the russian syndicates have started to come here. and in the spirit of glasnost the soviets have opened their borders to the mafia. but the italians, they're not convinced that the grounds in mother russia are fertile enough for organized crime yet. so they ain't ready to commit. the russians are coming here anyway. they are unwelcome. what we have here, gentlemen, is possibly the beginning of the first international mob war... unless i've totally missed something.}
<A>__{all their faces read the gravity of the situation.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what i just told you?}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{it's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{and is there an american, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. this is our wet dream come true. you can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{so, what do we do now?}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{that depends. you either do your job or get ethical.}
