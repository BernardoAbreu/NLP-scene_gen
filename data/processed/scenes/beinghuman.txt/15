<L>__{exterior cliffs day}
<A>__{hector's hands have been bound with rope. he is being led up to the top of the cliffs. the priest and the leader walk on ahead, still talking intensely. at the top of the cliff the bay and the boats and the wide sea are stretched out beneath them. the priest, as they arrive, becomes excited. he points to a pile of large stones at the very summit of the headland. the mound of stones is obviously man made.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{i told you! i knew they did it around here! ask him...}
<A>__{the leader moves closer to hector and talks to him in a friendly, reasoning tone.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{what do we do? do we throw you over, is that the idea?}
<A>__{hector doesn't understand. he looks at him blankly.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{he wants me to throw you over. what does it do? does it help the sun? should i throw you over?}
<A>__{the leader tries to help hector understand by miming the act of throwing him off the cliff. hector doesn't know how to respond.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{i tell you, it's one man, one stone. it'll help the voyage.}
<A>__{the leader is unsure. he walks around the pile of stones, checking it out from all sides as if it was some infernal machine that he didn't know the workings of. he squats down and squints through it to the watery sun emerging from the clouds far out to sea. he looks across to hector, now sitting on the grass. the leader sits down beside him. they sit together like friends. the ageless intimacy of sacrificer and victim.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{what's it got to do with the sun?}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{i don't know, yet.}
<A>__{the leader looks at hector. then he makes up his mind.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{no. it's too much of a risk. just add a stone to the pile. let him go. that's the best we can do. let's go.}
<A>__{with that, he stands up. the priest, with some sense of ceremony, looks around for a large stone, picks one up and places it on top of the pile. he waits for a moment, almost as if he expects some consequence of his action.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{it's meaningless, without him going over the cliff.}
<A>__{the leader strides off back toward the beach. the others follow him, giving a final look or smile to hector, apart from the priest, who looks him up and down, regretting that he is not by now a corpse in the ocean. hector watches them go, too shocked still to react in any mean ingful way. he stands alone, trying to unpick the rope that binds his hands. when they are some distance from him, hector starts to follow them, at first running to catch up and then simply trotting after them. the raiders are aware of him behind them. the leader eventually stops and calls to hector.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{off you go. we don't want you.}
<A>__{he turns from hector and moves on. hector persists in following them. they are his only connection now with anything that thinks or feels in the world. his link with them is all that is left. again and again the leader stops to shoo hector away, but hector dumbly tags along behind.}
