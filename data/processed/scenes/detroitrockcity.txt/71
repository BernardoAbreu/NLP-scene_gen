<L>__{interior producer's booth night}
<A>__{hawk, trip, lex, and jam sit in the tiny producer's booth with simon who fast forwards a reel to reel tape through some very loud, high speed conversation and bits of music. looking at the footage counter on the tape player, he slows down at a certain point and lets the boys listen to this: the click of a phone being answered.}
