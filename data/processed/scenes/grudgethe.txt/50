<A>__{twisting a corkscrew into a wine bottle, susan leans into the foyer, yelling upstairs:}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i will give you guys one minute to finish whatever you're doing up there and get your butts down here.}
<A>__{as she heads back towards the kitchen, we crane up to see matthew. he's walking down the second floor hall. he looks different: the expression on his face is troubled, occupied. and he's dragging his dead wife's body. by the hair. he pulls her inside the rear room the doorway looks more imposing, more ominous, than before. it's dark and malevolent, the threshold to a secret that won't stay buried. we crane back down to see susan in the kitchen. she's poured a glass of wine and sighs impatiently. she walks back down the hall into the foyer.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i mean it, guys.}
<A>__{silence from upstairs. shaking her head:}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{well, i warned you. prepare to be emotionally scarred.}
<A>__{she starts up the stairs and turns the first corner matthew is sitting there, hands on his knees, looking harried. susan yelps.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{matthew! don't scare me like that!}
<A>__{he's shaking slightly. his eyes drift up to hers.}
<C>__{susan}

<D>__{she went out. something came up.}
<C>__{susan}

<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i knew it. you guys forgot to go shopping, didn't you?}
<A>__{matthew abruptly stands. looming over his sister.}
<C>__{matthew}

<D>__{are you okay? what's going on?}
<C>__{matthew}

<C>__{susan}
<D>__{did something happen? what's }
<A>__{matthew's hands suddenly tighten on her shoulders. his eyes grow wide, filled with anger, as he whispers fiercely }
<C>__{matthew}
<D>__{she doesn't love me... she never loved me...}
<A>__{susan watches as he repeats himself, over and over. growing scared, she finally shakes him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{matthew slowly looks up. malice on his face. he steps forward. susan backs away.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{stop it, matthew.}

<D>__{leave me alone.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{matthew, please }
<C>__{matthew}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{go away!!!}
<A>__{susan fumbles with the front door. she gets it open and runs out just before matthew reaches her. on matthew: he stands there, head tilted down, for a moment. then he straightens. slowly closes the front door. matthew heads back upstairs. he reaches the second floor and opens the door to the rear bedroom. the room beyond is dark. but a dark figure is visible, standing in the far corner, facing matthew. he steps inside, and the door slowly swings shut behind him.}
