<A>__{major bell, bleary eyed and unshaven, is huddled in front of the television screens eating a breakfast off a styrofoam plate. on the top left screen is a satellite picture of northern michigan and half of wisconsin taken with a doppler radar. on the lower left screen is an infrared view of the same area. over both these views is a schematic of the state boundaries and major cities. on the screens to the right of these views are blow ups of smaller sections of the overview. lyman and the radar technician are asleep on the floor. seated in front of the radio console shermin is going through the telex messages. next to him the radio technician is bent over the desk with his head in his forearms.}

<D>__{there's nothing... no reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... seems like a totally isolated incident.}
<C>__{major bell}
<D>__{it was only an accident that we discovered them.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{i know, but...}
<A>__{shermin continues on through the messages. bell asks the computer to change the pictures on the screens. rhythmically, a sequence of images appears and disappears.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{you married, major?}
<C>__{major bell}
<D>__{twenty eight years.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{to the same woman?}
<C>__{major bell}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{i tried it once... fourteen years ago... 'i was a lousy husband and a worse father. the only thing i'm good at is this... at least until yesterday.}
<A>__{bell stuffs his breakfast plate into a garbage bag and goes to get a breath of fresh air in the open doorway. shermin stops at a point on the telex sheet. he reads the message to himself again.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{how would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?}
<C>__{major bell}
<P>__{(after trying to imitate them)}
<D>__{it was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{listen to this.}
<P>__{(paraphrasing the telex)}
<D>__{a woman was kidnapped in eau claire this morning. when a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...}
<C>__{major bell}
<D>__{it was a man though... right?}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{the police think he was high on drugs...}
<A>__{bell shrugs.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{what do you think?}
