<L>__{exterior restaurant mexico city night}
<A>__{creasy moves in the shadows looking remarkably strong considering his wounds. creasy surveillance pov cameras whirring. video being shot. he hasn't arrived alone. as he disappears inside...}
<L>__{interior closed restaurant night}
<A>__{the owner watches nervously as creasy approaches wearing a wool cap. a pale attempt at disguising his identity. there's a newspaper folded on his dais, more photos of creasy, his dead targets, the story of his vendetta.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i'm looking for rosanna guerrero.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{this way.}
<A>__{empty restaurant, chairs on tables. an exterior streetlight illuminates the darkness. the owner leads him down a row of empty booths. creasy slows, stops as he sees the only person waiting for him is manzano. as manzano smiles.}
<C>__{manzano}
<P>__{(holds up paper)}
<D>__{hombre en fuego. man on fire. that's what the papers have named you.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{it's what you and rosanna named me. right?}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{sit, creasy. everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{really. you won't find a better carne asada in all of mexico.}
<A>__{the table is covered in an arrangement of the best food you will ever find in mexico. creasy sits.}
<C>__{manzano}
<P>__{(laughs at himself)}
<D>__{the last few days may represent the best police work of my life.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{the same thing as you. except, my reach isn't as long as yours. my father was a policemen, did you know that?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i don't know shit about you.}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{he was one of the original founders of 'le hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.}
<A>__{manzano smiles; he likes creasy.}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{he was murdered. and now here i am. trying to honor his memory. hamstrung by bureaucracy and corruption. the organization that he began now protects criminals at the highest level where i would need a presidential finding in order to expose it...or you.}
<A>__{the waiter steps over; manzano waves him off.}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{my family lives in miami. because of the death threats.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{it's not worth it. be with them instead.}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{it galls me to watch you. you can do as much in days as i can in years. men like the 'the dreamer' are protected. out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?}
<A>__{manzano laughs again. genuine. creasy cracks him up.}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{my country needs justice. proper justice. gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. they need to be brought to trial. dealt with properly. then people will respect the law. when they see it works.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{so you are going to talk me to death.}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{you walk out and deal justice. you're what i wish i could be.}
<P>__{(another laugh, then a beat)}
<D>__{the policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{then i hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. what do you want?}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{i want to arrest you for murder! i want to shake your hand and reload your gun! i want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{my deal is with rosanna. i knew you guys were up to something. are you two fucking?}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{no, but i have to admit i thought about it.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{liar. just tell me who the bank card belongs to. name and address.}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{you have no interest in making things easy, do you?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i'm not... easy.}
<A>__{manzano reaches into his pocket. he pulls out a folded piece of paper and a prescription bottle. he hands the bottle out first.}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{percodan. i imagine you need handfuls by now.}
<A>__{creasy makes no move to take it. manzano sighs, sets it down in front of him. regarding the paper...}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{account belongs to a woman we think is the dreamer's girlfriend. reina rosas, who is 8 months pregnant.}
<A>__{creasy holds his hand out. manzano hesitates.}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{the plan is the girlfriend will lead you to the boss. you'll lead me, and i will arrest him. agreed?}
<A>__{creasy doesn't respond. finally manzano gives him the paper, a mimeographed mugshot, and address scrawled on it. creasy stands. as he scoops up the pills. creasy starts out.}
<C>__{manzano}
<D>__{creasy...}
<P>__{(creasy turns)}
<D>__{i'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{off the top of my head, i don't know what they could've been.}
<A>__{as creasy departs...}
