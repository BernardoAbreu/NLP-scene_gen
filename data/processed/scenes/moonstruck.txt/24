<A>__{loretta and cosmo sit at the kitchen table. it's a big tin table with a black and white design. loretta has put two old fashioned champagne glasses on the table, the split of champagne, a bag of sugar cubes, and a bottle of bitters. she pours the champagne, drops a little lump of sugar into each glass, and adds a dash of bitters. she hands one of the drinks to cosmo.}

<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{i didn't give you away the first time.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{and maybe that's why i had the bad luck. maybe if you gave me away, and i got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the city hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then i wouldn't had the bad luck i had.}
<C>__{cosmo}

<C>__{loretta}

<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{everything is temporary. that don't excuse nothing.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{so you'll come to the wedding, right?}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{let's go tell your mother.}
<A>__{she smiles. he doesn't. they rise from the table. the castorini house darkened master bedroom night the door to the hall opens, and the light from without dimly illuminates a massive four poster bed. cosmo enters, followed by loretta. he speaks into the dark a calm and measured summons.}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{rose. rose. rose. rose.}
<A>__{a lamp is switched on by the bed. by rose. rose is in her}
