<A>__{we follow joey's progress over the course of his first year. his initial fearfulness, his connection with his mother, the intimacy of their relationship. as joey gets strong they run together, frolicking gayly in the last dregs of summer. albert looking on. joey notices him at the fence and they share a moment of connection. spring: flowers are beginning to sprout by the hedgerows. our boy albert runs into the field. he takes an apple from his pocket he holds it out tentatively. joey approaches albert with suspicion. albert gently encourages him. his mother paws the ground and neighs at joey. he turns and runs over the field at her beck and call. albert tosses the apple to himself, ruefully watches in awe as joey races away with his mother. he is a magnificent one year old. his distinctive red coat gleaming, now it is clear that he is half thoroughbred. he runs quickly around the field enjoying his own power and strength. later the three farmers open the gate and come into the field. both joey and his mother instinctively canter over to the two men, expecting food. the three men gently greet the horses and pet them, then we see one man has a noose made of a rope. he slips it round mum's neck. she pulls back, joey is shaken and bewildered but before he knows what's happening the second farmer is trying to get a similar rope around his neck. joey balks and pushes the farmer aside, distressed to see his mother tethered. the farmer grabs joey again and struggles with him, enlisting the help of the second farmer. with some effort they get the rope around his neck and calm him down.}

<A>__{unused to being tethered joey pulls at the rope but the farmers are solid and firm. they gently lead joey and his mother across the field to the gate and out into the road. the whole road becomes overtaken by a flock of sheep on their way to the market. in the distance we hear the bustle of market day.}
