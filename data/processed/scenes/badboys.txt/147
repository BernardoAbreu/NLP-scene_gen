<A>__{burnett's gun lays amongst the flapping carp and sea weed on the floor. both burnett and casper go sliding across the wet floor and into a stall both reaching for the gun. burnett's there a second too late. casper's got the gun. he swings it onto burnett and squeezes the trigger. but nothing happens. burnett in turn, grabs casper's ears and hammers the big guy's head into the toilet until he falls unconscious. burnett picks up his gun.}
