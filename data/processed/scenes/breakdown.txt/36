<A>__{a small desert gas station mini mart just off the highway. a sign over the building: "last gas for 30 miles." the cherokee is parked at the pumps, hood raised. jeff comes out of the mini mart, carrying a plastic quart of oil. he unscrews the cap and starts to fill the crankcase, careful not to spill on the new engine. in the b.g., amy is visible inside the store, browsing a magazine rack.}
