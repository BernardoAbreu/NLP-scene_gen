<L>__{exterior river day}
<A>__{stands with a fist draws water into a set of bladder bags. dances with wolves squats next to her, staring at the eddying stream.}
<C>__{dances with wolves}
<D>__{how did you get your name?}
<A>__{stands with a fist smiles to herself as she fills up the last of the bags.}
<C>__{stands with a fist}
<D>__{i was not very old when i came to be with the people... i was made to work.}
<A>__{she lugs the filled bags onto shore and sits next to dances with wolves.}
<C>__{stands with a fist}
<D>__{i worked every day... very hard... there was a woman who didn't like me. she called me bad names... sometimes she beat me. one day she was calling me these bad names, her face in my face, and i hit her. i was not very big, but she fell down. she fell hard and didn't move. i stood over her with my fist and asked if any other woman wanted to call me bad names...}
<P>__{(laughing at the recollection)}
<D>__{no one bothered me after that day.}
<C>__{dances with wolves}
<D>__{i would not think so.}
<A>__{a little silence.}
<C>__{dances with wolves}
<D>__{show me where you hit her.}
<A>__{he taps his jaw. she makes a fist and brushes very gently at the point of his jaw. dances with wolves' eyes flutter. they roll up in his head and he keels over backward... out cold. she goes with the joke. bending over him she slaps lightly at each side of his cheeks, until dances with wolves revives. he sits up, rubbing his jaw. neither one acknowledges the joke and, a sudden awkwardness falls between them. stands with a fist fiddles shyly with the ties on the water bags while dances with wolves draws lines in the earth with a stick. finally he works up the courage to ask a delicate question.}
<C>__{dances with wolves}
<D>__{why are you not married?}
<A>__{the question comes as a jolt to stands with a fist. she stops her fiddling. a visible stiffness overtakes her. she quickly stands up.}
<C>__{stands with a fist}
<D>__{i must go.}
<A>__{dances with wolves doesn't know what to do. he only knows that he should not have asked the question. she slings the heavy bags over her shoulders and starts back up the path. dances with wolves jumps to his feet.}
<C>__{dances with wolves}
<D>__{i'm sorry. let me help...}
<A>__{but the words are delivered to her back. she is already hurrying up the path with her heavy load.}
<C>__{stands with a fist}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{five ponies have wondered into the middle of the path. she kicks violently at the nearest innocent bystander. the horses shy out of the way. he's left alone at the waters edge, frustrated and confused. he watches her go for a moment. then he lets the stick drop from his hand. he stares at it for a second then gives it a vicious little kick.}
