<L>__{interior cynthia's room day}
<A>__{cynthia is on the bad, crying. miriam comes in, sits beside her... cynthia jumps at the weight on the bad, calms when she sees who it is.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{honey, you can't blame yourself. lana was an unhappy girl. sometimes unhappy girls do foolish things.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{she didn't kill herself.}
<A>__{cynthia sits up.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{it was harris.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{harris?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{from unity house. he comes to me, miriam. he talks to me. he reminds me that i was supposed to go with them that night }
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{go with them }
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{through the fire. to the next world. they waited while i was in a coma... he told me that if i didn't join him, he would take someone also... and he did it, miriam, he did it!}
<A>__{miriam gets up, her face a mixture of sympathy... sympathy and something else. she lights a cigarette. involuntarily, cynthia flinches at the spark.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{you... you don't believe me, do you?}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{i believe that you believe it. and i also believe that shooting you up every time you get the heebie jeebies ain't gonna do shit for your real problems. we gotta get you out of here get you to some nice place at the beach or the mountains where you can fight your demons in your own way. right?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{but i don't know anyone. i don't have any money.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{you know me.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{and you have money, right?}
<B>__{close on miriam}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{look. despite popular opinion to the contrary, i have not always been the career borderline psychotic neurotic that i am today. up until a coupla years ago i was a writer, a reporter, a damn good one too... hell, i really kicked some ass with that selectric...}
<A>__{she seems lost in thought for a moment. unconsciously, she scratches her wrist... a wrist where we notice for the first time a purple scar across the veins.}
<C>__{miriam }
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{i was on the staff of a magazine... well, some people called it a rag, but it was home: me! magazine. you heard of it?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(shaking her head, diplomatic)}
<D>__{i was in a coma.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{oh, right. well, when they took me off to the funny farm, saul he's the editor he said i was always welcome back. maybe this is the time. see, if i can go to him, tell him your story, i could get a big advance... i'd share it with you, and we'd be set! i mean, girl, your story has everything... death, hospitalization, weird rituals, maybe a little romance i've seen all those longing glances between you and goldman }
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{what !}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{ and now with poor lana we got a little mystery. hell, you're not an article, you're a goddamned mini series!}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i... i don't know...}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{cynthia, let me be honest. this is a great story, and it means a second chance for me, so, okay, there's some self interest here. but i really think you need to tell people about unity house... about the way decent ideas and dreams got twisted into something sick and poisonous. you owe it to the world. you owe it to yourself. it's your life, and you have to ask yourself how you want to live it...}
<P>__{(sharper)}
<D>__{ if you want to live it.}
<A>__{cynthia turns, mind made up.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{let's do it.}
