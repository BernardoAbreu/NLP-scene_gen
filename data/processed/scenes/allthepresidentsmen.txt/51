<D>__{library.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{hi. carl bernstein of the washington post. i was just wondering if you remember the names of any of the books that howard hunt checked out on senator kennedy.}
<C>__{librarian }
<D>__{i think i do remember, he took out a whole bunch of material. let me just go see.}
<A>__{sound of the phone being laid down.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{ what do you think? }
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{ hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{maybe a political operative of some sort }
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{ a spy, you mean?}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{it makes sense; hunt worked for the c.i.a. and the white house was paranoid about teddy kennedy.}
<C>__{librarian }
<D>__{mr. bernstein?}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<C>__{librarian }
<D>__{what i said before? i was wrong. the truth is, i don't have a card that mr. hunt took out any kennedy material.}
<P>__{(woodward and bernstein listen, and now there}
<D>__{is something in her voice that wasn't}
<P>__{there before: fear)}
<D>__{i remember getting that material out for somebody, but it wasn't mr. hunt. the truth is, i've never had any requests at all from mr. hunt.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the truth is, i don't know mr. hunt.}
<A>__{there is the sound of the phone being dropped into its cradle. bernstein continues to hold his. he and woodward just look at each other. now }
