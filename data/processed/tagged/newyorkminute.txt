<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{yes, well, i'm sure you can appreciate that with so many applicants for so few spaces there must be rules to govern the selection process.}
<A>__{a fuss from the outer office interrupts them and suddenly the door bursts open and drew bursts in:}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{professor spaulding? i can't apologize enough for barging in like this.}
<A>__{the professor is not only thrown by the interruption, but by drew's particularly bizarre, barefoot look.}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{no. please. it looks like i'm taking the red eye now anyway.}
<A>__{drew shuts the door and then is startled when she gets a face full of parker, already there.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{parker?}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(worried wink)}
<D>__{hi, parker.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(don't blow it)}
<D>__{oh, the professor and i have had a wonderful talk about how important this program is to me and how it was my sister, drew, who screwed things up.}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{i'm having a little trouble following this.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you were... being me?}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{would you like to sit down?}
<A>__{seeing her plan to help drew go awry, poor parker's lip trembles.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{when i saw them take you to jail...}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{jail?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{... i didn't think you'd make it. i knew i wouldn't be any good at it, but i figured at least there was a chance.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that's... sweet.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you're not mad?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i'm so sorry for today.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{it's okay. but let's talk about it later.}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{please. go right ahead.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{parker, consider, just for a moment, whether this is the appropriate time and place.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{okay, i considered. what i want to say is, i didn't purposefully set out to ruin your day, but that doesn't mean i'm not a little... jealous.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{jealous?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i'm not like you. i don't have your intensity, your focus, your...}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{fashion sense?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i just mean, maybe, even if i don't intend to, maybe that jealousy, you know, gets in the way sometimes.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you mean subliminally you're undermining me?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i don't know if i'd get that technical about it. but yeah.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{well, thank you for saying that.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{aren't you going to confess now?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{confess what?}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{there's got to be something. like how you lost your shoes?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{how you're secretly jealous of me?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{why would i be jealous of you?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{oh, let me see. because i don't have a stick up my butt? because i know how to have fun? because i'm spontaneous and creative and men are all my love slaves?}
<A>__{drew stops, ponders this deeply.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{nope.}
<A>__{then she smiles, only a teensy bit.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{well, maybe about the love slaves.}
<A>__{this is the first moment in a long time when the sisters share a smile. drew turns to the professor.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{professor, i'm drew macleod.}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{are you certain?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i wanted more than anything in the world to be a part of your program. i still do. but i failed. i didn't follow the rules. and honestly, before today, i didn't know how i was going to live with that. how to live with failure. i'm not good at it. i haven't done it much. but today i realized that i've lived in fear of it too long.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{i hope my application was a strong one and i came here today to ask your indulgence and to place my name back into consideration. if you won't, i will understand. better yet, i will get over it. maybe i shouldn't be in such a hurry after all. maybe it would be best for me to just take this...}
<A>__{drew takes her daybook from parker and drops it in the wastebasket.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{... and lighten up.}
<A>__{parker looks horrified at the sight of drew's daybook in the trash and fishes it out.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{thanks for your time. sorry if you missed your plane.}
<A>__{he shakes her hand.}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{it was worth it, i assure you. now, could you clear up one thing for me? drew parker sure.}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{what's this about jail?}

<A>__{warren and jim sit waiting when the girls come out, smiling. drew turns to parker.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{the sisters hug, but we go... close on parker eyes wide.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{sis?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{gotta go.}
<A>__{parker grabs warren by the hand and blasts around the corner just as... charley macleod pulls up in his truck and parks half on, half off the curb. he leans over, waving to drew.}
<C>__{charley}
<D>__{hi, baby!}
<A>__{drew goes over to the truck.}
<C>__{charley}
<D>__{i was in the city. i tried to call you. thought you might want a ride home.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{charley}
<P>__{(what?)}
<D>__{is that a new outfit?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{yeah. hey, one minute, 'kay?}
<C>__{charley}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{drew goes back to jim.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i, uh...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you want to maybe... get together?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{first i want to take a shower. for about a week.}
<A>__{drew leans over and kisses him on the cheek. then she reaches into her bag and pulls out a card.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{call me, okay?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you have a card? aren't you in high school?}
<A>__{she smiles, shrugs and climbs in her dad's truck. they pull away, leaving jim waving. when they're out of sight, parker and warren come back around the corner of the building.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{oh, man. i'm doomed. i will never get home before them.}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{sure you will.}
<A>__{warren pulls out a cell phone, hits speed dial.}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{dad? hey. i need a favor.}
<L>__{interior helicopter day}
<A>__{passing over the city, warren and parker are strapped in, headphones on, and have to talk above the din.}

<D>__{yes! but in a good way!}

<D>__{girls?}
<A>__{quinn steps in, grimfaced.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{how naive do you think i am?}
<A>__{the girls share a look. busted.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{we, uh, don't think you're naive, mom.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no. honestly, it was all an accident.}
<A>__{quinn holds out her hand revealing a belly ring.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{i know what this is.}
<A>__{there's almost a palpable sense of relief between the girls. they both look down and pull up their shirts parker's not the only one who has her naval pierced drew does, too.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{parker, i'm disappointed you'd do something like this without consulting me, but drew? what got into you? do you know how unhygienic those places are?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{it was... spontaneous.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{yeah. obviously. oh, by the way...}
<A>__{she holds out her other hand, which has an envelope.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{this came in the mail.}
<A>__{they stare at the envelope nyu admissions department.}

<C>__{parker}
<D>__{come on!}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{it doesn't really matter one way or the other. maybe i shouldn't be in such a hurry. why don't we go out and have some fun. besides, if this isn't good news, i don't want it to ruin our night.}

<P>__{(simultaneously)}
<D>__{a dance a class.}
<C>__{charley}
<D>__{dance class, huh? stupid me. i figured it had to be that day in new york when parker blew off her chem test and drew was in jail.}
<A>__{charley smiles. he's not as out of it as he appears. suddenly, all three women scream joyfully o.s.}
