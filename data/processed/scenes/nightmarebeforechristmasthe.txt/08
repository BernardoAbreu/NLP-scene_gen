<L>__{exterior another street. night.}
<A>__{a lumpen looking long haired woman in heels hurries away down a tortuously windy street. this is sally. for now, we see only her backside, her waist length hair. behind her, and closer to us, a ghoul tips into view to demonstrate his particular talent:}
<C>__{ghoul}
<D>__{i am the guy with the tearaway face...}
<A>__{sally hesitates, listening.}
<C>__{ghoul }
<D>__{here in a flash and gone without a trace.}
<A>__{sally is about to turn around, but as the ghoul vanishes, she continues on her way. we follow her. in a moment, a second ghoul sets upon her this one more gruesome than the last.}
<C>__{second ghoul}
<D>__{i am the who when you call }
<A>__{this ghoul is closer, louder and sally does turn around now revealing that she's a crudely stitched together bride of frankenstein rag doll. her balance is precarious. her arms flop. her mouth is a tragic slash. she has a quavering, little voice:}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{ who's there?}
<A>__{but the second ghoul has disappeared before she sees him. only his voice remains...}
<C>__{second ghoul's voice}
<D>__{i am the wind blowing through your hair.}
<A>__{invisible fingers lift sally's long hair. it is with pathetic eagerness that she looks around for whomever is responsible for this.}
<B>__{a third ghoul}
<A>__{springs into view, then bounces skyward. with a very disappointed sally (she's sorry he's leaving), we watch him go up into...}
