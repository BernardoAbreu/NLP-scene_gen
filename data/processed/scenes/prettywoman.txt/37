<L>__{interior hotel penthouse night}
<A>__{as vivian steps into the room she has the sensation of falling off the top of the building. in front of her is a sunken living room with massive windows revealing the sparkling lights of the city below. for the first time, she is speechless. edward closes the door and walks past her down the steps to the living room. edward picks up a phone. vivian checks out the room.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{room service.}
<P>__{(to vivian)}
<D>__{what do you drink?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{diet coke.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{send up a bottle of crystal champagne.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{can i have some chips?}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{ and a bowl of strawberries. thank you.}
<A>__{vivian makes her way down the steps to the living room. she stares at the view.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(to vivian)}
<D>__{impressed?}
<A>__{vivian is impressed but she's not going to admit it.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{you kidding? i come here all the time. as a matter of fact they do rent this room by the hour.}
<A>__{edward smiles. he sits down in a comfortable chair and leans back. vivian looks at him.}
<C>__{vivian }
<D>__{well, now that you have me for the night, what are you going to do with me?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{want to know something? i don't quite know. i hadn't planned this.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{do you plan everything?}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(a small smile)}
<D>__{always.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{well, the meter's running, it's your money. speaking of which, cash'll do. in advance.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{fair enough.}
<A>__{he rises. takes out his wallet. standing over her, he drops three crisp, new hundred dollar bills in vivian's lap. she picks up the bills, stares at them, trying not to be impressed. she puts the money in her jacket. she realizes edward is standing over her as if waiting. she leans forward, reaches out to unzip his pants. he abruptly turns away.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{let's talk some more first.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{right.}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{so! in town on business?}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(taking off his jacket)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{let me guess, you're a... lawyer.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(loosening his tie)}
<D>__{and why do you say that?}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(a small smile)}
<D>__{i dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.}
<A>__{edward almost smiles. he sits across from her again.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{i've known a lot of everybody.}
<A>__{a chime goes off to indicate there's someone at the door.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{champagne.}
<A>__{he starts to sit up. vivian motions for him to stay put.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{hey. i might as well make myself useful.}
<A>__{edward sits back down. vivian waltzes up the steps and opens the front door. a waiter comes into the room with a silver cart; on it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{where would you like it?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{where would we like it?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{where would we like it? here'll be fine.}
<A>__{the waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle of the living room. he turns and heads back up the stairs and pauses near vivian, staring. vivian stares back at him.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{what are you looking at?}
<A>__{the waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits. vivian closes the door behind him. vivian marches back down the stairs.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i think he wanted you to tip him.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{tsk. excuse me, i didn't think he had change for a hundred.}
<A>__{edward crosses to the silver stand. vivian watches with interest as he twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket.}
<C>__{vivian }
<D>__{you have a wife? girlfriend?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i have both.}
<A>__{edward lifts the bottle out. he deftly pops the cork on the bottle without losing a drop of champagne.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{where are they? shopping together?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{they should be. they're both good at it.}
<A>__{edward pours the champagne into a single long stemmed glass and hands one to vivian.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{my ex wife lives in london in what used to be my home. my girlfriend is in new york moving out of my apartment even as we speak. cheers.}
<A>__{he drinks, nods approvingly.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{it's a very good year.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{oooh, thank god.}
<A>__{edward laughs softly. she sips it. to her surprise, really likes it. edward lifts a lid on a silver bowl to reveal a dozen enormous strawberries.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{try a strawberry.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{jesus, you act like you're seducing some valley girl you picked up in a dance club.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.}
<A>__{a moment. she slowly eats a strawberry. the juice of it stains her lips. her eyes are like smoke as she takes a sensuous sip of champagne, licks away the stain of the strawberry. his eyes haven't left her.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you really are a very beautiful girl.}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(husky voiced)}
<D>__{just a romantic, that's you.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{yes...}
<A>__{her mouth is so wet and inviting... he leans closer...}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{me too.}
<A>__{he's about to kiss her...}
<C>__{vivian }
<D>__{not on the lips.}
<A>__{he freezes. she pulls his head down to her breast.}
