<L>__{interior another room sugai's house}
<A>__{nick enters, ducking his head in the low doorway. the shoji slides shut behind him. the furnishings are minimal but elegant. there's a butsudan, a tokonoma, and a low, long table in the middle of the room. no chairs. nick sits on the floor. a door slides open at the far end of the room. sugai, wearing a kimono over western style suit, walks in. nick stands up to shake his hand. sugai ignores it, and sits in the traditional position: feet tucked beneath him.}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{i will spare you the ritual.}
<A>__{he tosses him a palm sized bundle. nick catches it. inside, are brand new greenbacks: hundreds.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{this supposed to impress me?}
<A>__{he sets it down.}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{pick it up. look at it.}
<A>__{nick hesitates, then picks it up again. he runs his fingers over the face of the bill and snaps the paper.}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{seven years work by the finest engraver. mass produced, sequentially numbered. the best there has ever been, mr. conklin.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm impressed. but let's use the short form. i'm looking for }
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{ kobo... i know. he killed two of my partners. one in new york, one at the printing plant.}
<A>__{sugai fills a cup of tea for nick and hands it to him.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't drink tea.}
<A>__{sugai hands it to him anyway.}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{i took kobo from the street. i gave him a home, a future... but my ways were too slow for him... i served seven years in prison for my boss when i was a young man. kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his oyabun.}
<P>__{(sipping his tea)}
<D>__{he was supposed to take over this syndicate when i retired.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i want him.}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{he'll be dealt with.}
<A>__{sugai sets a plastic wrapped object on a table before nick. nick recognizes it from the restaurant massacre in new york. close up: nick's fingers tear at the plastic. a block of black iridescent polymer. the negative image of a $100.00 bill. a printing plate.}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{our associates in new york were close to closing a deal with us.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{the families who control the casinos?}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{yes. unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... we can't afford not to deal with them.}
<A>__{sugai takes the plate back.}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{the feds would be onto you in a month.}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{not with these bills. and even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?}
<A>__{nick looks at a child playing near one of the hot pools in sugai's garden.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{why tell me this?}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{the other plate is currently in new york, in the hands of kobo's man. find it for me.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you trust me?}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{i will pay you.}
<A>__{nick laughs at sugai's audaciousness.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(indicating the counterfeit bills)}
<D>__{with these?}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{swiss bank deposit. gold bullion. whatever you want. you know the city and the police.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{if i say no?}
<C>__{sugai}
<D>__{you're smarter than kobo. you know the price of deceit. think about it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't have to.}
<A>__{sugai cools. without a word he gets to his feet and starts toward the door.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i have ten hours to grab my man.}
<B>__{on sugai}
<A>__{still walking with his back to nick.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{you won't get hurt.}
<A>__{sugai turns to see nick, across the room, pointing the beretta at his head.}
