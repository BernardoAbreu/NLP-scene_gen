<L>__{exterior city street night}
<A>__{rain droplets splash on the river where bruce first raged at god. he stands in the middle of the street, looks up heavenward, weakly. humble.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{you win. i' m done. please. i don't want to do this anymore. i don't want to be god.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{please, help me.}
<A>__{and with that, the rain stops. the dark clouds slowly open as beams of light cut through, shining down upon bruce, birds begin to chirp.adding to this magical moment as. . . honk1 honki a mac truck slams through frame, mows bruce down. his spirit remains in the same spot, looking confused, then streaks up heavenward.}
<B>__{flying pov}
<A>__{shooting heavenward like a missile, through the clouds, through the sky to... a huge white room no walls, just white as far as the eye can see. the flooring is the whitest of white puffy clouds. bruce finds himself standing there. he looks around and when he turns behind him, he sees god. floating on nothing, as though sitting in the most royal throne.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{am i...?}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{you can't expect to kneel down in the middle of a highway and live to talk about it.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{but why? why now?}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{i work in mysterious ways, son.}
<A>__{a beat as bruce takes everything in.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{you knew it all along. you knew if i got everything i wanted, i would ruin my life.}
<A>__{god doesn't respond, just listens.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{so i'm dead... okay. if this is what you want. okay, okay...}
<A>__{god holds up the prayer beads, tosses them to bruce. bruce looks at the beads, then up at god, puzzled.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{go ahead, use 'em.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{alright... i've learned that i don't know as much i thought i did...}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{boy, you can say that again.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{hey, i'm praying here.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{sorry, go.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{if i could have just one thing in the world. it would be for grace to live a happy, joyful life. and that she finds someone...}
<P>__{(getting emotional as he realizes what he's saying)}
<D>__{...that she finds someone that will treat her with the love and respect that she so deserves.}
<A>__{god smiles the most satisfied of smiles.}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{now that is a prayer.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, i better get on that one. see ya, bruce.}
<A>__{off bruce's puzzled reaction he drops through the clouds falling pov back down towards earth, back through the clouds, and right into another white room where... bruce eyes open and he gasps for breath. the prayer beads still clutched tightly in his hand. two doctors stop giving bruce cpr, see that his vitals have returned. . .}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{he's back!}
<C>__{intern}
<D>__{bp 40 over 110 and rising. doctor #1}
<P>__{(to bruce) }
<D>__{bruce? can you hear me?}
<P>__{(bruce nods)}
<D>__{we almost lost you there.}
<A>__{wider angle the white room is a hospital room bruce is heavily bruised and bandaged.}
<D>__{doctor #1 you lost a lot of blood. it wasn't easy to find a match you're a very rare blood type.}
<A>__{bruce looks to the blood bag, sees "a b positive" written on the side. close on bruce thinking, his mind racing}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(groggy whisper)}
<D>__{a b positive...}
<P>__{doctor #2 (o.s.)}
<D>__{you should thank god for donors. we don't have a lot of that type on hand.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{there's your angel now.}
<A>__{bruce turns toward the hospital door and sees...}
<B>__{grace}
<A>__{a cotton swab taped to her arm. now he remembers where he heard of that blood type.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(re: her swab)}
<D>__{i hear that all of this winds up in a warehouse somewhere. but you know me, i'm a sucker for this stuff.}
<A>__{the doctors give grace the nod to enter as they go, leaving the two of them alone. grace tentatively approaches.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i don't even know what i'm doing here. but... when i heard that you'd been in an accident and that you might not make it. . .}
<A>__{she starts to cry.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{hey, i'm okay.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{does it hurt?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{only when i talk., and smile... and y'know, exist in general.}
<A>__{grace laughs. that's one thing bruce could always do, is make her laugh. grace spots the prayer beads in bruce's hand, raises his arm.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh my gosh, you still have those?}
<A>__{bruce looks at the prayer beads, then looks at grace. he remembers his prayer to god and the emotion wells within him}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{nothing. it's just really nice to see you.}
<A>__{she goes to him, bruce sits up a bit and they embrace.}
