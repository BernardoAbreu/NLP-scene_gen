<L>__{exterior air shots jungle, church day}
<A>__{chris sits at the very edge of a huey chopper, bandana around his forehead, long hair blowing in the wind, barnes' mark below his eyes, slicked out now like a jungle veteran, looking down at the village where the massacre occurred. the village is still a smoking ruin, a few peasants and water buffalo straggling like ants to reconstruct. bunny, next to chris, pops his gum, indifferent. barnes, next to him, shifts, reads a map. rodriguez is praying, his mouth moving without audible words, getting ready for the drop. king is making last minute adjustments in his pack. bunny now nudges chris, points. the church in the jungle where elias was killed is visible. an outline of the cemetery. uncomfortable memories play over chris' face.}

<D>__{they sent us back into the valley the next day about 2,000 metres from cambodia into a battalion perimeter. alpha company had been hit hard the day before by a sizeable force and charlie company had been probed that night. there were other battalions in the valley, we weren't the only ones but we knew we were going to be the bait to lure them out. and somewhere out there was the entire 141st nva regiment.}
<A>__{the battalion perimeter now breaks in the clear ahead. smoke grenades of various colors are being popped on the cleared lz. it's not big, its radius 200 yards, heavily sandbagged, deeply dug, rolls of barbed wire protecting it, radio antennas sprouting from the cp and surrounded on all four sides by jungle. the first chopper rocking down, whipping up dust clouds. chris jumps out, moving out fast as the second chopper starts in.}
