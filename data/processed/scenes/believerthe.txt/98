<L>__{exterior lower manhattan day}
<A>__{danny and miriam walking together among the trees.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{you're telling me you killed him? you? killed him? bullshit. what kind of gun did you use?}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(guessing)}
<D>__{a forty five.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{it was a nine millimeter.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you're lying.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{so are you... but they'll believe you....}
<P>__{(as they walk)}
<D>__{lina moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. that you proposed it in a meeting at her house.}
<P>__{(when he doesn't deny it)}
<D>__{ah, jesus, danny... what were you thinking? are you glad manzetti's dead? do you really want to kill jews? you want to kill me?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i was just talking. i look, i can't help what i think.}
<A>__{he doesn't know how to answer, walks away from her to the railing overlooking the water. he stares into the current flowing past. finally miriam joins him....}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{all right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the nazis to expose them....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{but i wasn't.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{and only talked about killing manzetti to convince them you were an anti semite. if you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i can't say that.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{think about your father. your sister.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{the truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{danny, i'm trying to save you.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(over her)}
<D>__{fucking kike.}
<A>__{miriam is stung. she can't believe he said that. still, she gets a small tape recorder out of her purse, hands it to him.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{try to get lina moebius on tape, telling you to do something. something violent... that's right, i don't care about truth. i care about you.}
<P>__{(looks at her watch)}
<D>__{kol nidre's at six thirty. i've got to meet stuart. we'll be at the minyan tonight and tomorrow. if you need me, come there....}
<A>__{danny watches her walk away, then turns to the railing. ideally a ferry is pulling away from its slip and heading out across the harbor. he watches it, then looks down at the current moving past. he reaches a decision, throws the tape recorder into the water, turns and walks away....}
