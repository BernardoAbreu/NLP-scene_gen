<A>__{"the ugly truth", live on air. the look of the show's set is low rent cable tv.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i'm mike alexander and we're back with the "the ugly truth." tonight, as always, we're going to talk about what it is men and women really want in relationships. i've been looking through some books...}
<A>__{he holds up several books in his hands, reading the titles.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{"smart women foolish choices", "women who love men who hate them", "hating men who love women but hate loving men"...}
<A>__{he drops the books on the floor, picks up a can of gasoline and pours it on the books.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{billions and billions of dollars wasted on self help psychobabble.}
<A>__{mike lights a match and tosses it on the books, setting them ablaze. then opens up his jacket and takes out a stick with a marshmallow. begins roasting the marshmallow on the flame.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{now listen up, ladies, cause i'm only gonna say this once tonight and it's just three little words. no, they're not "i love you." here goes... men. are. simple. we can not be trained. all this "men are from venus" bullshit is a waste of your time and money.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{you want to be a lonely hag, then keep reading these stupid books. you want a relationship, here's how you get one: it's called a stairmaster. get on it and get skinny and get some trashy lingerie because at the end of the day, all we're interested in is looks. no one falls in love with your personality at first sight, they fall in love with your tits and your ass. and they stick around because of what you're willing to do with them. you want to win a man over? you don't need ten steps. you need one. and it's called a blow job.}
<A>__{mike shoves a burnt marshmallow into his mouth.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{and don't forget to }
<A>__{he mimes swallowing.}
