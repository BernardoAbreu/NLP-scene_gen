<A>__{lori's car pulls up, and she gets out.}
<L>__{interior charley's continuous}
<A>__{lori enters, and looks around. she spots john, who looks up from a menu. he is surprised to see her. she sighs and walks over to him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{lori! what what are you doing here?}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{you can thank ted.}
<A>__{a beat. john smiles slightly.}
<C>__{lori }
<D>__{how are you?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{good, good. i've, uh... made myself a nice little home at the midtown hotel up the street. i'd show you around, but it's kinda classy. they require an undershirt and at least one visible cold sore for all customers.}
<C>__{lori}
<P>__{(laughs humorlessly)}
<D>__{well. shall i sit?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{uh, yeah.}
<A>__{she does. there's a beat. a busboy brings them each a water.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{so, work's good? everything good there?}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{yeah. work's fine.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{how's rex?}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{there is no rex.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh. good.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well... i guess we can't make small talk all day, so i will say what i wanna say. i could sit here and tell you i'm sorry, it was a huge misunderstanding, and i'm ready to change. but i don't think you wanna hear any of that crap. i'm not gonna try and get you to take me back. why would you? i've been a really shitty boyfriend for the last four years. i don't deserve you. i didn't take our relationship seriously, even though i love you more than life itself. all i want is... just to end on good terms. because i owe that to you. i want you to be happy... and for us to be friends.}
<C>__{lori}
<P>__{(a little taken aback)}
<D>__{wow. thank you. i appreciate that.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{well. that's pretty much it.}
<A>__{he takes out some money, and puts it on the table, paying the check. he smiles at her and walks out. she sits there for a beat.}
