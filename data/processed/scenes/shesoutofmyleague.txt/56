<L>__{exterior cafe front patio}
<A>__{...and take a table on the crowded patio.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{can we get a couple of menus?}
<P>__{(then to kirk) you eating?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{maybe just a salad.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{dude, one salad ain't going make up for thirty years of chili dogs.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i know. but i got dinner with my folks later.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{fun. be sure and stab your brother in the eye with a fork for me.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{sorry, eric's not coming tonight.}
<A>__{kirk motions toward a mismatched couple (nerdy guy with knockout girl) who pass kirk and stainer's table on their way to the valet stand. stainer rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{you know what this is ridiculous. i'm just going to call her.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{fuck you are! put that thing away. you do not call her. don't you get it? talon is back in town.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no, she broke up with him.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{so, you're telling me you were sitting there, a sweating, quivering stutter bucket and when you came back from the can, molly's hugging a guy who's so good looking you'd probably fuck him. what do you think she's doing this weekend?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{so what am i supposed to do?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{what can you do? she hasn't called she's not going to.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you're probably right.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{just count yourself lucky. you got to kiss a goddess and you got out before she recalibrated your hardware. a chick like that can raise the bar too high and then once she dumps you, nobody else measures up.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no, you're right. you know what it's good. it's better. i'm actually relieved. you should have seen this talon guy. man! all i've been thinking about is having to be naked in front of her. i don't need that kind of pressure.}
<A>__{the valet pulls a red ferrari up to the mismatched couple and the nerdy guy opens the door for her. stainer shakes his head as if to say, "was there even a doubt?" kirk's phone is sitting on the table it rings. kirk and stainer can see molly's name on the caller id.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{don't do it!}
<A>__{the phone rings again. kirk glances down at the phone. stainer keeps a stern eye on kirk. ring! close on kirk's eyes turning weak. ring! close on stainer's threatening eyes. ring! kirk gives up and looks away. stainer's eyes calm. kirk snatches the phone but stainer grabs kirk's wrist, pinning it to the table. ring!}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{cut it out!}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{let it go!}
<A>__{ring! kirk reaches for the phone with his other hand but stainer's free hand intercepts it and these arms flail around like battling snakes. kirk presses the button to answer the call and, instead, moves his head down to the phone.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{hello!?... oh, no problem! yeah i was super busy yesterday anyway.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{would you look at yourself?}
<A>__{stainer lets go and kirk sits up and backs away.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{well, i have dinner with my folks tonight... oh, i wouldn't want to subject you to them... okay. if you want to. i can pick you up...}
<A>__{kirk gives a confident smile and an "i told you she'd call" nod. stainer crosses his arms and shakes his head.}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{oh, sure. well then let me call you back in a few minutes and i will give you directions. alrighty. yeah. buh bye.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{well, i guess you just solved that. an hour with your family and she'll file for a restraining order.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no. eric's not going to be there. it's going to be good. you might be wrong about molly. she might...}
<A>__{stainer spots a round little boy posting a "lost puppy" flyer over one of the ten he just posted on the kiosk.}
<C>__{stainer}
<P>__{(to the boy)}
<D>__{whoa! i don't think so spanky! a little lower!}
<A>__{the boy instead posts it over a "walk for a cure" poster.}
