<ACTION_ALT>__{CREDIT SEQUENCE.}
<ACTION>__{As OPENING CREDITS play, we study the city's nighttime pulse, ribbons of headlights moving and cross-connecting like blood through the veins of a body -- impressionistic, even beautiful, but what we're hearing is soulful trumpet-based MUSIC, mellow and haunting, the modern classic -- JAZZ sound of a Wynton Marsalis, putting a voice to our story. As CREDITS END, we...}

<ACTION>__{POV - EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT Now the MUSIC is GONE, SOUNDS are MUFFLED and vision blurred. We get the impression of urgent movement. We hear BREATHING. There are VOICES, SHOUTS, even SCREAMS, but MUFFLED, far away. Only the breathing is distinct. We come to realize it is our breathing, and we are inside someone, looking out. The man whose POV this is is on the edge of consciousness and not far from death. He lies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of an accident only minutes after impact. His VISION goes IN and OUT of clarity. People are swarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage of wrecked vehicles. A SIREN BLOOMS in the distance and approaches haltingly. The man slips away, comes back toward consciousness, slips again. The crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage to a police officer. It is a woman, Officer SHARON POGUE, LAPD. She kneels at the man's side, taking charge, speaking, but we hear only SLIVERS of SOUND. He sees her face clearly now, close above him. Sharon is   a dedicated professional and more. We see down into her   to a place of real caring. She stares into our eyes and   connects. We begin to hear her now -- and there are more   SIRENS converging in b.g.}

<ACTION>__{We PICK OUT a police car from the traffic and FOLLOW. The beat being patrolled is a mixed neighborhood with some very rough edges.}
<LOC>__{INT. POLICE CAR - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Officer Sharon Pogue is driving the car. It is two years since we saw her at the accident site. Her partner, ROBBY LEWIS, sips coffee and keeps one eye on the CAD monitor which lists all area police calls. She slows behind a car that is crawling along, an old 60s car, driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the bench seat. The car's ENGINE is MISSING and smoking.}

<CHAR>__{SHARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Get it together, officer.}
<ACTION>__{As Robby smiles, Sharon looks ahead at the young couple who each have an arm around the other. She is stroking his neck. He is making gentle circles in her hair. Sharon watches this, and for a moment her eyes reveal a depth that may be loneliness, but she quickly pushes her thoughts away and hits the HORN, startling Robby and startling the people ahead who now disengage and drive on.}

<ACTION>__{At the same time, a few blocks away, an OLD, FRAIL MAN is carrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy for him. Walking behind this man is a younger man named CATCH LAMBERT, an attractive man with some scarring on his face. His eyes, deep down, are haunted by something, but there is energy in his step. He is dressed in a relaxed and stylish manner, not expensive. He begins to pick up his pace to catch up to the old man. People glance at Catch, nad he glances back in an open and unflinching way, ready for anything, a smile, a nod, or -- because these are some of L.A.'s mean streets -- a threatening or taunting look. These he also meets openly, without a trace of fear. The man has been through some kind of fire, and it has left him different from us. Outside the usual boundaries. Catch walks beside the Old Man, glancing at him. Finally, the man glances back, wondering and suspicious, but Catch has a slight, disarming smile, open and honest.}
<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Y'know... since we're both walking the same way, I could take one of those bags for you. That way, I do some upper body work while I'm walking along. Helps my back. What d'you say?}

<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Right now your mind's making pictures of me robbing your groceires, but, y'know, nine times out of ten, people do the right thing.}
<ACTION>__{The Old Man glances at him, still not convinced, but he soon has to stop and rest. Catch stops, too. The old man looks at him, a bit embarrassed.}
<CHAR>__{OLD MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's the dog food that makes it so heavy.}
<ACTION>__{Catch nods, puts out his hand. The Old Man hesitates, then decides and lifts a bag, and Catch takes it.}
<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I guess it's worth it... for a good dog.}
<ACTION>__{Catch isn't kidding. He has that honesty. The Old Man nods and starts trudging again. As they walk on together, Catch reaches for that second bag. The man relents and lets him take it. They continue on, Catch carrying the bags and every now and then lifting them a bit for his upper body work.}
<LOC>__{EXT. VIDEO GAME ROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{This is the call Sharon and Robby have sped to. It is a chaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eight boys, 16-20. A big KID, 18 or so, is being pulled off another by Sharon and Robby. The Kid is wild and resisting and Sharon shows her toughness and professionalism and some anger, too, as she slams him into a fence -- and Robby holds him while she cuffs the young man -- who is very mouthy, playing to his friends.}

<DIAL>__{Look at this bitch.    Whoo!   Benny, look at this!}

<DIAL>__{As I remove your cuffs, I want you to put your hands here. Spread your legs. More.}
<ACTION>__{As they remove the cuffs, the Kid makes a sudden move toward Sharon, reaching between her legs -- but she was not only ready for this, but hoping for it -- and the stoniness of her face cracks into fierce anger as she moves quickly and grabs the Kid by the hair, bringing his face into her upraised knee. He cries out and goes down on his knees, hurting and bleeding. The jailer rushes over to help, but Robby grabs the Kid's wrists.}

<DIAL>__{You broke his nose.}
<CHAR>__{SHARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He grabbed me.     End of story.}
<CHAR>__{ROBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And you were waiting for him. You were hoping. You were making long-range plans for his ass while he was mouthing off in the car -- and you're supposed to be above that shit.}

<CHAR>__{ROBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<ACTION>__{They enter the car, Sharon behind the wheel.}
<CHAR>__{SHARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not you, Rob. You're a rare unthreatened male cop with a good marriage, and you like to eat where I eat -- so everything's code four.}
<ACTION>__{She STARTS the CAR and starts to back out, and he reaches over and turns OFF the IGNITION. She stares hotly at him -- but then, slowly, she softens, takes a deep breath.}

<DIAL>__{Come over    for dinner tonight. I'll call    Charlene. She'd like to see you.     It's been awhile. We'll talk about    it.}

<CHAR>__{SHARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks. But  she'll invite friends, try and fix me up. She's always trying to fix me up so she doesn't have to worry about you and me.}

<DIAL>__{She doesn't worry about that.}
<CHAR>__{SHARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{They all worry about that.}
<ACTION>__{They both smile wryly, driving on.}
<CHAR>__{SHARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You don't need to fix me, Robby, or fix me up. I don't want some guy to heart and soul me and then walk away 'cause he can't stand the cop thing -- or worse: he wants cop stories every night 'cause it turns him on, and he has no idea who I am inside my head. Anyway, I'm busy tonight.}

<ACTION>__{She is on the floor using an exercise rig, sliding into crunches, pushing herself, sweating, alone. We BEGIN DRIFTING TO the rain-spattered window as night sounds filter in, HORNS, SOMEONE SHOUTING, a CAR MOVING BY with THUNDEROUS BASS MUSIC that pulses the very air and RATTLES the LOOSE GLASS of her window.}
<LOC>__{EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Catch Lambert is walking the wet streets, head down in the rain. Far away we hear that car with a BASS-BLASTING}
<ACTION_ALT>__{RADIO.}
<ACTION>__{In the glow of a street lamp, Catch sees a bright-colored object in the gutter. He picks it up out of the gurgling rain water. It is a small toy, a discarded superhero. He puts it in his pocket, walks on. Now the car, the prowling, MUSIC-BLASTING, BASS- THUNDERING CAR turns a corner and begins rollling along slowly -- beside Catch. He glances over, walking on. There are four tough-looking MEN in the car, looking for trouble. The MUSIC is DEAFENING. Catch glances again, walks on. Their eyes follow him like gun barrels. He stops and walks out on the street, moving toward the car, shouting over the music.}
<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey! You want to turn that volume down? What's your point?}
<ACTION>__{The men, incredulous, stop the car and snap OFF the MUSIC in order to make sure they're hearing right. They stare death at Catch.}

<DIAL>__{What did you say?}
<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What's the point of blasting your music through the whole zip code? Don't you realize there are kids trying to sleep in these apartments -- old people, sick people?}

<DIAL>__{Why?   What're you gonna do?   Kill me?}
<ACTION>__{Catch's look is not a macho challenge. It's something else -- beyond that, a man somehow without limits. One of the riders in the backseat taps the Driver's shoulder.}
<DIAL>__{MAN #2 Guy's nuts.   Let's go.}
<ACTION>__{The Driver, never breaking his death stare, snaps on the DEAFENING MUSIC and then slowly rolls on, still glaring at Catch. Catch stands in the rain, watching them go.}
<LOC>__{INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Catch is arriving home, soaking wet. He lives in a slightly-seedy three-story. As he walks down the corridor toward his apaprtment, he passes a neighbor's door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock. He pauses -- and then knocks softly on the door. Someone looks through the peephole and then opens the door -- a young single mother, friendly but with a little caution, too. She recognizes Catch. Behind her is a little boy, (five). The woman's name is CANDACE. Her son is TOMMY.}

<ACTION>__{While she is talking, Catch is staring deeply at the boy, who is shy. Catch almost speaks to the boy, wants to, goes halfway to a smile -- but the sight of the kid stirs that layer of darkness in Catch. He nods a good-bye to the mother and is about to go. She thinks about this, as he is turning, and pushes through her remaining caution to say...}

<DIAL>__{Y'know, we were just baking nectarine bars because the peaches weren't ripe. Ever had a nectarine bar?}

<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sorry.   Gotta be going.}
<ACTION>__{And with one more glance at the boy, he walks to his apartment, unlocks it and steps in.}

<ACTION>__{He walks into a bare living room -- no chairs, tables, lamps, nothing on the walls. He walks into a spotless, never-used kitchen and flips on the light, opens a drawer. In the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found, some purchased, mostly plastic figures. The action of opening the door has started some battery-operated animals moving around in there. Now from his pocket he takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in and closes the drawer. He walks back into the living room. He sits on the floor, leans back against the wall, his clothes still soaked from the rain. He stares at his thoughts, looking a bit numb -- and lost.}

Sharon exits the car and walks onto the site, moves toward a man who is both carpenter and supervisor on the job. This is her brother, LARRY POGUE, 29. They are not comfortable with each other -- an old wound. He gives her a wary nod. She's trying a little harder, being a bit more friendly. We can sense the strain.}

<DIAL>__{We're yelling like mad, and Dad bursts into the room and says, what the hell are you doing? And I'm scared. I'm really scared.}
<CHAR>__{SHARON } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{And I say, we're playing alien invasion, Dad, and he says, oh, yeah, I'll show you a damn invasion, and he picks me up, picks me up off the floor and throws me on the couch. I hit that couch and bounce off, and he grabs Larry and throws him on the couch, and then... then he starts making these monster sounds, and he says, we came to earth to kick ass, and I run at him and jump on him and he tosses me on the couch and then Larry, and we're laughing so hard I almost wet myself, and he keeps tossing us and growling and beeping, and it was... it was great. It was great, and I'm never going to forget that. Never. And I miss that. I miss it. So I just... I wanted to tell you tanks for that, Dad. Thanks. That's all.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pause)}
<DIAL>__{Bye.}
<ACTION>__{She hands the microphone back and walks away as the surprised looks, the deep looks of her Father, Mother, Larry and Kathy follow her. She walks to the front door and leaves.}
<LOC>__{EXT. POGUE HOUSE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Sharon exits    and starts to walk away. She sees Larry Jr. look up from    his play. He smiles at her. She returns the smile --    it means a lot to her, and she walks on. As she reaches    the gate, she notices something across the street that    halts her. She stops still, surprised and so pleased.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{HER POV}
<ACTION>__{Catch is there, waiting near her car, watching her now. BACK TO SCENE - FULL SHOT as Sharon walks to him, so glad he's there, needing him -- but still not sure of what he's feeling about her, until she gets close and sees his eyes and the way he opens his arms -- and they embrace, and she holds on tight, eyes closed. They break the embrace, still holding on, searching each other's eyes.}
<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sorry, Shar.   For what I said.}
<CHAR>__{SHARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Me, too.}
<ACTION>__{In a moment, he gestures toward the Pogue house.}
<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Was it bad?}
<CHAR>__{SHARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{They don't like me in there.}
<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then they don't deserve you in there.}
<ACTION>__{She stares a moment more, still together.}
<CHAR>__{SHARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's a nice thing to say.}
<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not a thing to say.   It's the truth.}
<ACTION>__{She can only look away, not wanting to cry.}
<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why do you try so hard not to cry?}
<ACTION>__{She stares at him again. Her throat fills with tears, mouth is trembling a bit. She starts quietly, finally, with nothing held back -- but this is not anger as much as mourning.}
<CHAR>__{SHARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not fair.}
<ACTION>__{The tears come, and she doesn't fight them, emptying the old, old wound, speaking through her weeping now. The first time we've seen her cry.}
<CHAR>__{SHARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not fair. Things got better for them because of what I did. Things got better, and I'd still do it. I'd do it all over again. And it's not fair they shut me out. It's not.}
<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<CHAR>__{SHARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not fair. I was     19, and I didn't know what else    to do. I didn't know how else    to stop it. It's not fair I don't    have a family anymore.}
<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.   It's not, Shar.    It's not.}
<ACTION>__{He raises his hands to her face, places a palm gently on each cheek, and she covers his hands with her own and closes her eyes. They remain that way awhile. In a moment he lightly kisses her forehead. There is a depth to his words...}
<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We're the family, Pogo.}
<ACTION>__{She opens her eyes, staring deep into       his. He has said it all -- as it is and as it will be.        She smiles a bit through her tears and nods. He puts        an arm around her shoulder and holds her tight against       him as they walk to her car. She puts an arm around his        waist. They reach the car, and she unlocks it, gets in behind the wheel as Catch gets into the passenger seat.}
<LOC>__{INT. CAR - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Sharon just sits behind the wheel, still shaky from crying. She puts the key in the ignition, but doesn't move -- no longer sad, but drained now. He watches her. In a moment, he gets out of the car.}
<LOC>__{EXT. CAR - FULL SHOT}
<ACTION>__{Catch comes around to Sharon's window. She rolls the window down, concerned, wondering what he's doing. Is he leaving? But he reaches for her door and opens it and says without a fuss...}
<CHAR>__{CATCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll drive.}
<ACTION>__{She stares a long moment,    realizing,    but also making no fuss about it as she gets    out of the    car, walks around and enters the passenger    side. They     close the car doors. Catch STARTS the CAR and    drives them    away. Drives them home.}
