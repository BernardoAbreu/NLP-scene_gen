<A>__{the truck veers off the highway and jerks to a halt in front of the rundown establishment.}
<L>__{interior roadside diner day}
<A>__{a dozen white folks look up as ray and claude push through the door.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{man, something smells good in here. how's everybody doing?}
<A>__{nothing but sullen stares from all corners of the room.}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{maybe we oughta find another place.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{are you kidding? tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i must have left my appetite outside, which is where i think we ought to be right now.}
<A>__{claude tugs ray towards the door but ray won't be dissuaded. he boldly addresses a young man in an apron behind the counter.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{good evening, billy. we'd like some coffee and a couple of slices of that homemade pie you've got advertised.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{how you know my name's billy?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it says so right there on your shirt.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(glancing down)}
<D>__{that what that says?}
<A>__{billy's mama sets a piping hot pie on the back counter and steps up next to her son. she casts a disparaging glance at claude's suit.}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{if you boys can read so good, how come you missed that sign in the window?}
<A>__{claude considers the sign she's pointing to.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you mean this sign? the one that says "no coloreds allowed." that's a good question. ray, how come we missed the sign?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. we'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{those are whites only pies.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{got any nigger pies?}
<A>__{claude jabs him.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{any fool could see those are whites only, not for blacks, come on let's get the fuck outta here pies. thank you very much.}
<A>__{claude starts tugging ray toward the door.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{thanks for backing me up here, uncle claude.}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{don't uncle claude me. you get a load of those crackers? couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you're soft.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what'd you say?}
<A>__{diner patrons stare.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i said you're soft.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{hey, man, don't ever call me that.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i call it like i see it, and what i see is definitely soft.}
<A>__{claude narrows his eyes.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{alright. you want some pie?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah, i want some pie.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{okay then, i'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.}
<A>__{resolved, claude stomps over to the counter.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{excuse me, ma'am, i bet a brick will turn that one right there into a colored pie.}
<A>__{claude lays down a dollar bill. mama casually pulls a shotgun from under the counter.}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{and i bet this right here will turn you into a colored pie.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{okay, ray, i think we can go now. much obliged...}
<A>__{ray gives the whole place a cool once over as claude pulls him out the door. mama turns to billy, still studying the stitching on his shirt.}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{don't be concentrating so hard, baby. you're liable to seize yourself again.}
