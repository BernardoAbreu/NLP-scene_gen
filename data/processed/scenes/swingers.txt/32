<A>__{establishing shot of an airstream trailer dug into the desert on chocks. trent's car and two el caminos are parked out front.}
<L>__{interior christy's trailer same}
<A>__{the foursome, now somewhat more intimate, sit huddled around the fold out table. they've been drinking whiskey and long neck buds, judging by the recyclables. the pairings seems to be trent christy, mike lisa. the cramped compartment is filled with secondary smoke and laughter.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{no... no... the worst was when i went in for this after school special and i'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. i see they're all signed in for the same role as me...}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{they were auditioning for the same role as you?}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{wait... wait... listen... so, i check the time and place. i'm where i'm supposed to be. i call my agent... she says they asked for me specifically...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what was the part?}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{oh... "i love you... i can't believe you're doing this... drugs are bad..." whatever. after school bullshit. the role is brother.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{"big brother", "little brother"?}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{wait... wait... just "brother". so i go in. "hello... hi... we loved your guest spot on baywatch... blah blah blah..." whatever. so, i start to read, and, mikey, i was money. i prepared for a week. it's a starring role. i'm crying... the casting director, she starts crying...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{did you get it?}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{wait... she's crying. i finish. i hold up my finger like "wait a second". they sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. i look up and they all start clapping , and now they're all crying. even the camera guy .}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no! not the camera guy!}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{i'm telling you!}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{so what happened?}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{so, i swear to god this is exactly what he said. the producer says to me... now he's still crying... he says to me that i was great, that that was exactly what they were looking for...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{... so give me the fuckin part...}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{right? ... that i nailed it... whatever. then he says it's just that i'm a little old . i'm like "how old is the brother?". he's like, he says this with a straight face, i swear to god, he says " eleven ."}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{so, what'd you say to him? " double down ."?}
<A>__{they all crack up even more.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{it's like, you looked at my tape. you saw my picture. why did you call me in? you knew i was twenty four.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{what an asshole.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i believe it.}
<A>__{the room dies down. the girls settle into the arms of their men. there's a lot of body language and pheromones, but not a lot of words.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{how rude of me. i haven't given you the tour.}
<A>__{she gets up and leads trent into the sleeping compartment to the rear. the door slaps shut. mike and lisa, in all her made up glory, look into each others eyes.}
