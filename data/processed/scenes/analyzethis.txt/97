<A>__{vitti is conferring with sal masiello, his consigliere.}
<C>__{masiello}
<D>__{paul, i don't mean this in a disrespectful way. you know i was a good friend to your father and i will always be a good friend to you. but the word is out that you've been talking to a shrink. is that right?}
<A>__{vitti shoots jelly a sharp look. jelly looks away.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{what's the point here?}
<C>__{masiello}
<D>__{this concerns the whole family. right now, we're the only ones who know about it, but if it gets out on the street what then? who knows what you've been saying in there?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{it's none of anybody's business what i say in there.}
<C>__{masiello}
<D>__{paul, i beg to differ. if you're doing this to establish some kind of insanity defense later, that's one thing. but everybody's gonna think you're falling apart, and that ain't good. they'll take it as a sign of weakness, and that makes us all vulnerable. sindone would take over everything.}

<D>__{so what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{masiello}
<D>__{it's time to end it.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{what do you mean, end it?}
<C>__{masiello}
<D>__{get rid of this shrink. he knows too much already.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{you want me to whack my doctor?}
<C>__{masiello}
<D>__{if you don't do it, somebody else will. it's the only way.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{no. nobody touches him. you hear me? anybody lays a finger on him, i will kill 'em. is that clear?}
