<A>__{claire's frozen in the hug.}
<C>__{caitlin}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{mom.}
<A>__{her eyes open. widen to reveal claire, holding caitlin on the college campus. the urban skyline looms in the background.}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{i have'ta go.}
<A>__{after a moment's hesitation, she releases her grip. caitlin glances over her shoulder to make sure no one's witnessed this overt display of maternal affection.}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{i will call you.}
<A>__{claire produces an envelope, which she presses into her daughter's hand. it's a book of train tickets.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{come home anytime.}
<A>__{caitlin looks at norman.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{really gonna leave me, huh?}
<A>__{she nods. they share a tender look.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{be good.}
<A>__{she throws her arm, briefly, tightly around his waist. a bit overwhelmed, he slowly brings his hand to the back of caitlin's head. after a moment, she steps back...}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{...then turns and makes her way toward the large, old columbia dorm. a banner is draped across its portals which reads:}
<D>__{"welcome class of '04."}
<A>__{claire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly shaggy freshmen, smoking and talking on the front steps. her eyes are shining. norman wraps an arm around her waist as she daps at a tear with a kleenex.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i almost made it.}
<A>__{they turn and head for the car. claire sneaks one last look over her shoulder.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{caitlin glancing back at claire with an apprehensive smile.}
