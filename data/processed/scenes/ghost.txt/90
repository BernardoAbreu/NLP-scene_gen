<A>__{with a sudden thrust, oda mae sends her foot shooting into willie's balls. as he recoils she knocks the table into his lap and rushes for the closet. we see her barricade herself in the hidden chamber. willie, shaking, scrambles to his feet and, before sam can stop him, blasts his gun at the closet door. it is riddled with bullets. sam screams out. willie runs to the side door and escapes to the street. clara and louise come rushing in. sam charges into the closet and sees that oda mae is safe behind the false door. then he hurries to the street.}
