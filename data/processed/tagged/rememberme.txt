<L>__{exterior smith street station brooklyn night}
<A>__{it's very late. it's quiet. just the sounds of the city linda santana craig, an attractive hispanic woman in her thirties, waits at the elevated station for the f train. linda looks great. she's dressed festively but tastefully. next to her is her eleven year old daughter, alicia. she is twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday party they attended in the city. alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink handbag. we notice a charm bracelet with four leaf clovers on her right wrist. the mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station platform. two teenage boys wait at the other end. they speak soft, slurred spanish to each other. linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. she watches them as alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand. the boys approach. linda tenses. at the last second the boys make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell. it's quiet again. linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter. the f train is rounding the final bend into the station. their focus is on this train. it's getting closer, louder. and so they don't see, don't hear the boys coming back up the stairwell behind them. not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his gun. linda puts her arm around her daughter. alicia looks terrified. the train roars into the station as linda quickly hands over her purse, her watch. she hands over her engagement ring and her wedding band. one of the boys yanks alicia's little purse away from her. the other boy fumbles the wedding band. the ring clangs to the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away. we hear men's voices echoing up the stairwell. now the boys are boxed in. and starting to panic. the train doors slide open . the boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail car, leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform. through the window on the train, linda stares at the boy holding her daughter's purse, her face hardening into a mask}
<B>__{of contempt.}
<A>__{the boy clocks it. who does she think she is? the train doors begin to close when a hand with tattooed knuckles reaches out and stops the car doors from closing. a forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car ... there's a muzzle flash... a distant pop... a cloud of smoke ... a mist of blood... and linda's body collapses on itself. alicia's face, shock, terror and blood.}
<L>__{exterior smith street station later that night m.o.s}
<A>__{a working crime scene, lots of uniforms and light, a white sheet draped over linda's body where it fell. blue and red light dances against the stairwell wall where a man is taking the stairs two at a time. late thirties, big, plain clothes, he is sergeant james craig. when he reaches the platform, he stops. craig kneels before the white sheet. peels it back. we stay on him. we don't see what he sees. we just see how he sees it. then he turns... the wedding band. it's been tagged and numbered as evidence. craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it into his pocket. alicia, wrapped in a blanket, standing next to a round police matron. the matron is tenderly trying to clean alicia's face. alicia locks eyes with craig and stumbles towards him, her legs not quite working. craig saves her from the stumble and envelops her, lifting her as the blanket falls to the ground. alicia makes little gasping noises. trying to speak but can't. craig walking back now, carrying his entire world. he reaches the stairwell and suddenly falls to one knee. alicia gasps. the closest uniform puts a hand on his arm. a moment. composure. a deep breath. then as quickly as he went down, he's back up. craig looks back now, taking it all in. is it real? sees all the cops looking at him, then begins down the stairs. we drift up above the station until we find ourselves with a clear view of the southern tip of manhattan, where the twin}
<B>__{towers stand tall.}
<L>__{interior lower east side railroad flat bedroom morning}
<A>__{subtitle: "eight years later" tiny kitchen, clutter, a messenger bike hanging from hooks on the wall, a lot of books. there is a phone ringing under the bed. tyler roth, early twenties, handsome, looking haggard. he is sitting on the floor, shirtless, bed head, wrapped in a blanket. a guitar is on his lap. tyler has propped some well worn, hand written pages of music against a box of off brand laundry detergent and is squinting at the notes, frustration etched in his face. a forgettable blonde lies sleeping on the bed. tyler, not a born musician, is trying to teach himself one of the phrases of music in front of him. he is completely lost in the moment, with deep grooves in his fingers. by the ashtray next to him, we can tell he's been at this a couple of hours. the blonde in the bed re: the ringing phone...}
<C>__{blonde}
<P>__{(out of it)}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{tyler gropes around the floor with one hand until he finds the phone, simultaneously glancing at the digital clock. his eyes widen in alarm.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{yeah...}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{of course. i'm on my way. i know...i know...i know...i know.}
<A>__{tyler climbs out of his blanket and yanks on a pair of dark suit pants. before he pulls on his white undershirt we observe a tattoo that simply says "michael" over his heart. he searches through a beat up chest of drawers, seeking a reasonably clean button down shirt...}
<D>__{tyler v o gandhi said that whatever you do in life will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it...}
<A>__{...and scrubs at a mysterious stain on the shoulder of an expensive but worn to hell suit jacket with a dishwasher brush.}
<D>__{tyler v o ...i tend to agree with the first part.}
<L>__{exterior green wood cemetery brooklyn later}
<A>__{a cluster of mourners stand before a tombstone in the distance. they are not in funeral dress, as this is not a funeral. it's a memorial. a beat up gypsy cab with a west indian driver pulls to a stop. from the trees and the sky we know its late spring early summer. a gorgeous day. tyler gets out of the cab, holding the rim of his empty coffee cup in his teeth. he sorts a rumpled wad of singles and hands some to the driver, who screeches into reverse. time is money. tyler crushes the coffee cup flat and slips it in his jacket pocket then lights up a smoke. he takes one long drag then extinguishes it and slips the butt into his pocket. he begins towards the mourners. his mother... diane hoffman, a beauty. past burdens etched in the lines on her face. dressed tastefully in expensive bohemian. she smiles like someone who's been crying but doesn't want anyone to know she has.}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{hello, your majesty. how are you?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i'm fine... you look good...}
<A>__{he kisses his mother's hand and he's moving to greet his stepfather... les hoffman, unruly curls streaked in gray, tweed jacket and tie. they exchange a firm handshake and muttered hellos. the weight of tyler's gaze falls to caroline roth, his diminutive bespectacled, eleven year old sister. she's holding a little paper bag. she flashes him a look. he kneels besides her and whispers...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{thanks for organizing everybody.}
<A>__{caroline makes a face. turns her nose away from him.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you smell like listerine and beer.}
<A>__{he snorts and kisses her cheek. caroline reaches into her bag and takes out a handful of smooth white stones, on which she has painted the names: "mom" "tyler" "les", "dad", "caroline". she begins to arrange them in a little circle on the grave. tyler's father... charles roth, late fifties, breathes power, precisely dressed, two hundred dollar haircut. a predator.}

<P>__{(aside, to tyler)}
<D>__{you couldn't wear a tie?}
<A>__{tyler holds his father's eye.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{could have.}
<A>__{beat. charles adjusts his own collar like it's an explosive. pov: the tombstone. the four adult family members stand side by side. they look like strangers on the subway as caroline sits on the ground, arranging the stones.}
<L>__{interior junior's restaurant brooklyn after}
<A>__{the family sits together in a booth. tyler rolls a bic lighter over his knuckles. caroline draws a funny portrait of tyler on her napkin. he is smoking nine cigarettes at once. diane gives the menu a ridiculous amount of attention. les is eyeing the cheesecake. charles subtly aligns his silverware.}

<D>__{...this is nice... i think it's nice that we still do this...}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{mom.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i forgot. i'm trying to purge "nice" from my vocabulary. michael would like that we still do this.}
<A>__{tyler takes out a cigarette. lights it. without saying a word his mother takes it and snubs it out in an empty water glass.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(to caroline)}
<D>__{did you tell tyler what your art teacher said about your portrait?}
<A>__{caroline, as bemused as an eleven year old can be, looks at her mother, then at her brother. she adopts a very motherly tone.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{tyler, did i tell you what my art teacher said about my portrait?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{why no, caroline. what did your art teacher say about your portrait?}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you two. i quit.}
<A>__{she flickers a glance at her ex husband and squeezes les' hand.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{...she was very impressed. she said i captured a moment like a young james whistler.}
<A>__{the waitress brings platefuls of extravagant cheesecake to the table. les dives in. charles is having toast. he sips a glass of water and takes a surreptitious glance at his patek phillippe.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{young whistler... good... 'cause whistler really fell off late in his career. he's the michael jackson of european art history.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{she suggested your sister take pratt's summer art intensive and that's hugely prestigious.}
<A>__{caroline looks a bit sheepish, tyler high fives caroline. diane, again, flickers a glance at charles.}

<D>__{are you really this clueless? are you really dismissing her like this?}
<A>__{diane touches caroline's hair.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{caroline is perfectly capable of speaking up if she is feeling dismissed. caroline, are you feeling dismissed?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i'm okay.}
<C>__{charles}
<P>__{(solicitous, to caroline)}
<D>__{i didn't mean to change the subject.}

<A>__{tyler in his pants and white tee shirt looks completely out of place amidst all the business types. he sits in the last booth facing the street. his tattered journal lies open in front of him, a binder clip holds his page as he works quietly crafting an entry. the hostess, tired, in her 60's, slides a piece of baklava on the table as she shuffles past.}

<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{...congratulations?}
<C>__{aidan}

<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{and you think women would buy this? with money?}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{hey one night stands happen... it's a part of life... like stubbing your toe. sometimes you misjudge a corner and bend back your pinky toe, other times you wake up in a freshman dorm wearing a field hockey tee shirt wondering why your balls smell like cinnamon...}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(nodding sagely)}
<D>__{of course. yes.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{don't underestimate the novelty gift market. think about it... instead of giving that token slutty friend a ten inch purple dildo for her birthday, you hook her up with "the slut." everyone has a laugh and the implication that she'll probably use it someday remains. what do you say? are you down?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{i'm down with getting you on some sort of medication.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{ok...fine...be cynical...just remember at some point in history two people had a conversation just like this about the light bulb. one of them went on to fame and fortune and the other one probably went to work at mickey d's or something.}

<C>__{girl}
<D>__{isn't that also an ethical question?}
<A>__{tyler shoots her a glance. he takes in her lovely face, her casual dress, and the charm bracelet with its four leaf clovers. we realize this is alicia "ally" craig, now 19. tyler grimaces at the question and its implications of hope.}
