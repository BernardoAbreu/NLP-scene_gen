<A>__{ sammael, still in mid air. it hits him square in the chest: an explosion of green goo!! with a shriek, the thing leaps over a wall. hellboy scrambles after it.}
<L>__{exterior loading alley night}
<A>__{on the empty sidewalk, hellboy sees a trail of glowing goop. he hits full stride, following it around a corner. myers lands a second later, cradling his arm, chasing after him.}
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{wait! no, what are you doing?}
<A>__{loading dock alley sammael dashes by, followed closely by hellboy, running full tilt. a ten wheeler backs up, effectively blocking their way. a few workers load pumpkin boxes in it.}
<C>__{worker 1}
<D>__{what the hell is that??}
<A>__{without slowing down, sammael jumps onto the trailer, denting the roof then jumping off and into a crowded carnival area. a small carrousel and refreshment stand flank a pumpkin patch. full of curiosity, sammael pauses a second to inspect a trick or treater dressed as a golden dragon. hellboy catapults himself onto the trailer's roof.}
<D>__{3 workers}
<P>__{(chorus)}
<D>__{whoa whoa whoa }
<A>__{hellboy jumps and lands heavily on top of the driver's cab: crash!!! the driver is almost crushed under the steel. he screams, showered by thousands of glass shards. myers is a few steps behind.}
<C>__{myers}
<P>__{(into headset)}
<D>__{we'll hit the street in a minute. we're heading towards civilians...}
<A>__{he squeezes between the vehicle and the alley wall. the vendors are yelling at him.}
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, crazy costume, uh? trick or treat!!}
