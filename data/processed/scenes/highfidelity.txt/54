<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{rob comes out of the club and follows liz. she hears him and turns on him, punctuating with a finger in his chest.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{to think i sympathized with you for two seconds! poor rob! laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs. you let me believe that!}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it's true!}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{rob! two years ago you got laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her! you borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back! and then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{well she }
<A>__{she turns again and keeps walking, holding a defiant middle finger over her shoulder as she fades down the street.}
