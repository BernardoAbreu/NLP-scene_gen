<L>__{interior vanderspeigle house day}
<A>__{as soon as she's inside she's all business.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{no forced entry.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{not that we can find.}
<A>__{upstairs vanderspeigle's home office isabel looks around vanderspeigle's home office. behind a fake bookcase is a small room which contains the safe. in the other direction is vanderspeigle's bedroom.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{we can't figure out how they disabled the alarm. we thought maybe they tried to short it out somehow.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{no, that would have triggered the system.}
<A>__{isabel goes to the alarm pad. pulls the face plate off, examines the inside.}
<C>__{isabel }
<D>__{and damaged the circuits.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{well, then i don't know how they got in.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{they had to have known the code.}
<A>__{she moves on to look in the mark's bedroom.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(calls to her)}
<D>__{we considered that, but the mark swears that nobody in the world knew the code except him. he programmed the last seven steps of the system himself. he set it and never left the house again. when he dies, we'll probably have to physically cut all the power lines to the house to get it off line.}
<A>__{isabel examines the computer brain of the alarm system which was locked inside a titanium case in vanderspeigle's bedroom closet. she answers the detective almost as an afterthought.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{there are other ways to get the code.}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{closed loop. redundant servers. titanium encasement. not bad.}
<A>__{the lead detective enters the bedroom.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{like what?}
<A>__{again, isabel is inside her own mind. she's really just answering the detective's questions out of courtesy.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{uh...well, they probably set up in a house across the canal and watched him type the code in through a pair of binoculars.}
<A>__{we go with him as he walks back into the office. he stands at the alarm panel and pretends to type in the code. he twists around and looks out the window behind him.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(calling to isabel in the bedroom)}
<D>__{actually, i don't know about that.}
<A>__{isabel re enters the office.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{unless he had a habit of typing in the code like this }
<A>__{he stands to the side of the panel and reaches over to type in the numbers. it's an obviously unnatural position. then he moves in front of the panel and types in the code as one normally would.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{ then his body would block the view from across the canal.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{that's why they probably set up over there }
<A>__{she points out an adjacent window on another wall.}
<C>__{isabel }
<D>__{ and used the mirror.}
<A>__{she points at a small mirror on the opposite wall. the detective bends down so his eye is at the level of the keypad, then he looks in the mirror. he can see directly across the canal into another house.}
<C>__{isabel }
<D>__{i'm guessing they'd need a fifteen hundred millimeter lens to get a clear shot but }
<A>__{but isabel's already moved on. something has caught her attention just above the alarm panel: a patch of paint that is shinier than the paint that surrounds it. isabel puts her finger to her tongue to wet it, then touches the shiny area. when she pulls her finger away there is paint on it. isabel cocks her head. mind's eye (isabel) the night before a black clad thief (linus) uses a paint brush to touch up the wall above the alarm keypad. back to scene the crime scene the lead detective watches isabel intently.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{isabel uses the blunt end of a letter opener from vanderspeigle's desk to gently dig at the wall under the painterior the plaster there is soft and wet. in fact it isn't plaster at all. it's spackle.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{isabel cooks her head again. mind's eye (isabel) the night before thunk! a crossbow bolt hits the wall above the alarm panel. back to scene the crime scene}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{it's where the crossbow bolt hit.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{a crossbow bolt?}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{ever heard of franz schuman?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{isabel is at the window. the one that vanderspeigle leaves cracked open every night. isabel looks across the canal at the apartment where basher and saul were playing cards.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{they would have fired from that roof. through this open window.}
<A>__{isabel kneels down, checks the line of sight to make sure she's correct.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{from that roof, through this window? nobody could make a shot like that.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{not a cop, anyway.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{sorry. your friend downstairs put me in a bad mood.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{he's an idiot. you shouldn't let him bother you.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{yes. you're right.}
<A>__{isabel pulls out a notepad and writes the name: "eugene `basher' tarr." there are two names above basher's in her little book: "robert ryan" and "danny ocean."}
<C>__{isabel }
<D>__{but these man are exceptionally good. even when they make mistakes.}
<A>__{mind's eye (isabel) the night before a bolt flies through vanderspeigle's open window and hits the wall above the alarm pad. two thin wires are attached to a tiny wheel, which is attached to the back of the bolt. the wires run back to the window of the apartment across the canal. inside that apartment: the wires end in another tiny wheel which is mounted on a large tripod for stability. in effect the group now has a mini clothesline running between the alarm pad and the apartment across the canal. livingston attaches a device designed to fit directly over the number pad of vanderspeigle's keypad to the "clothesline" that runs across the canal. back to scene the crime scene isabel writes: "livingston dell?" underneath basher's name in her notebook. mind's eye (isabel) the night before livingston's device is shuttled across the canal, through vanderspeigle's cracked window and right to the alarm panel. magnets on the side of the device cause it to snap into place over the top of the keypad. livingston then types a six digit code into a remote keypad. his keypunches are mimicked by the remote device. vanderspeigle's alarm shuts off. downstairs: from inside we see the front door lock picked. the door swings open. back to scene the crime scene isabel nods her head. there's a slight smile on her face. the smile of admiration, respect in another's skills.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{when did he get up and notice the certificate was gone?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the alarm woke him at 4:2o am.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{but the alarm would have been }
<A>__{she stops. and smiles to herself.}
<C>__{isabel }
<D>__{oh... oh, i know what happened.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{isabel quickly glances around the room. her eye lands on the floor near the false bookcase. on some dark lines in the crevices where the floor boards meet. she kneels down for a closer look.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{there was someone else.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{someone else.}
<A>__{mind's eye (isabel) the night before danny and rusty come through the front door. they are followed by linus. all of them are soaking wet from 24 hours in the swamp under the house, and the last few minutes in the pouring rain outside the front door. the group silently slips up the stairs.}
<C>__{isabel }
<D>__{oh, i wish i could've have seen that.}
