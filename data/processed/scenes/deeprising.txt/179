<A>__{trillian stares down into the water. hanover keeps a sharp, nervous eye back down the catwalk, white knuckling his pulse rifle. chin and mamooli keep watch, tight lipped. canton paces back and forth, driven by anxiety.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{stop pacing.}
<A>__{canton acts as if he does not hear. he keeps pacing. hanover chops sharply with the stock of his rifle into canton's arm. canton crumbles against the railing, in pain.}

<D>__{how brave we are.}
<A>__{trillian's eyes fix on hanover's, unwavering. a mexican standoff.}
