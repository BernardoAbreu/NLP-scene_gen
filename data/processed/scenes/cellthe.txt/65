<L>__{interior campbell center conference room courtyard day}
<A>__{catherine and novak sit on a bench in the center of the courtyard. john tracy is visible in the reception area, unable to sleep, desperately trying to fight frustration.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{why'd you bring him here?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{you're the shrink, you tell me.}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(already knows)}
<D>__{as soon as i met him, you knew i'd say yes. he makes julia real for me.}
<A>__{novak nods. guilty.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{it's an old lawyer trick. target the emotions. do it right, you get a reluctant witness to testify, a scared kid to confess.}
<A>__{catherine looks at him with disbelief. "you?!"}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{before i was with the bureau, i was an attorney, a prosecutor. mr. law and order. and then... i had a murder case in north carolina. charles gish. butchered seventeen people in three days. and because of one tiny piece of tainted evidence, he walked.}
<P>__{(no regrets)}
<D>__{that's when i quit the da's office and joined the fbi.}
<A>__{catherine can see the pain and frustration in novak's eyes. she gives him a moment and asks:}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{you thought stargher wanted to be caught.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{i did, yeah.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{you were right. there's a part of him that knows the truth. about what he did, about himself.}
<A>__{novak's curiosity is piqued.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{what about julia?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{this is going to sound terrible, but... i don't think she matters anymore. not to him. he never finished her. the others...he was able to make them his.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{you think you can do this, don't you?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{he might tell me about julia. the part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse. who wants to be redeemed.}
<C>__{novak}
<P>__{(skeptically)}
<D>__{this is stargher we're talking about?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{not stargher, not really. he's split himself right down the middle. good evil, right wrong, merciful cruel. a monster. and an innocent child. if i could reach the boy.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{whoa. hold on. aren't they the same guy?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{don't you feel there are different sides to every personality? maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act. we're all human.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{it's hard for me to see stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{then what is he?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{evil.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{if you believe that.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(sensing something)}
<D>__{what happened to charles gish?}
<A>__{novak doesn't respond. she prods him.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{what difference does it make...?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{tell me.}
<A>__{god, he does not want to do this.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{right after the trial, the night after he was released. mr. and mrs. frank simmons found charlie sitting in their living room watching tv with their twelve year old daughter margaret. he'd cut her right down the middle with a carving knife.}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{found the girl's heart in the freezer he thought they might want to keep it.}
<P>__{(grim humor)}
<D>__{luckily, the next thing he did was slit his own throat.}
<P>__{(bleakly)}
<D>__{i am convinced of one thing. charles gish could've been raised by ozzie and harriet and the same thing would've happened.}
<A>__{he can see catherine doesn't accept that.}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{a child can experience abuse worse than charlie's. and grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{you're sure of that?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{yes. i am.}
<A>__{catherine realizes that was a confession.}
<C>__{ramsey }
<D>__{where the hell you been?}
<A>__{they turn to see ramsey.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{right here.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{next time, tell me, okay?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{but you looked so cute. all sleepy...}
<A>__{ramsey shoots him a murderous look, then asks catherine.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{your colleagues want to know what to do with stargher.}
<A>__{novak looks to catherine for the answer. through the window blinds, she watches john tracy lower his head.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{tell them to prep him. and that i will be right there.}
<A>__{ramsey nods and heads back to the lab.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{briefly, he touches her hand. catherine looks away from john to novak's hand, to the photographs on the wall. stargher's house, valentine, the pick up truck. valentine...}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i need something.}
