<L>__{interior father benedetto's kitchen evening}
<A>__{sixteenth century. sombre wood panelling stained dark with polish and smoke. two paraffin lamps stand on a huge antique sideboard, their frosted orbs engraved with scenes from the life of our lord. the room is filled with a dining table: a massive black edifice of oak, five inches thick with six legs fluted like the columns of cathedrals. using antique crockery, ancient copper pots and utensils like old fashioned instruments of torture father benedetto performs culinary alchemy: transforming flesh into meat, dough into bread, hard earth nuggets into vegetables. he hums as he cooks: opera arias. and johnny cash. jack sips from a glass of wine and watches father benedetto potter around the wood fired stove. the priest has his own wine which he sips as he works between bouts of humming.}
