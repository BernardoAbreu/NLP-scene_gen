<L>__{interior mint hotel suite night}
<A>__{duke slumps onto the sofa.}
<B>__{silence.}
<A>__{gonzo rips open the bathroom door, his eyes unfocused. he waves the razor sharp blade out in front of him lunges at}
<B>__{duke. duke whips out a can of mace.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{mace! you want this?}
<A>__{gonzo stops hisses.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{you bastard! you'd do that, wouldn't you?}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{why worry? you'll like it. nothing in the world like a mace high. forty five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{you cheap honky sonofabitch...}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{why not? hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! and now you want to kill me! what i should do, goddamnit, is call the police!}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{the cops?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{there's no choice. i wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(mumbles)}
<D>__{who said anything about slicing you up? i just wanted to carve a little z on your forehead. nothing serious.}
<A>__{gonzo shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the tv set.}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(menaces him with the mace)}
<D>__{get back in that tub. eat some reds and try to calm down. smoke some grass, shoot some smack shit, do whatever you have to do, but let me get some rest.}
<A>__{gonzo turns toward the bathroom suddenly sad.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{hell, yes. you really need some sleep. you have to work. goddamn. what a bummer. try to rest. don't let me keep you up.}
<A>__{gonzo shuffles back into the bathroom. duke wedges a chair up against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next to the clock. duke turns on the tv. white noise fills the room. he collapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{ignore the nightmare in the bathroom. just another ugly refugee from the love generation.}
<A>__{the white noise snow storm on the tv is reflected in his face. the camera pulls back revealing the entire wall}
<B>__{behind him to be swirling with the fizzing snowstorm pattern.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{my attorney had never been able to accept the notion often espoused by former drug abusers that you can get a lot higher without drugs than with them. and neither have i, for that matter.}
<A>__{the pattern on the wall changes to a 60's viscous oil lightshow pattern. with duke still sitting in the foreground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior of a haight ashbury dance hall full of dancing proto hippies.}
