<L>__{interior pub day}
<A>__{smoky hell. two firemen drag out a fire hose. glass, t.j. and reilly approach a taped off area where pooch is on his hands and knees, wet and dirty as he searchs for clues. schnoz sits nearby, red ball in his mouth.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{by the way, i'm glass. this is t.j., and pooch.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{mike reilly.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<P>__{(offering dirty hand)}
<D>__{uh huh...}
<A>__{reilly avoids the hand.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{that there's schnoz, mascot and ace bomb sniffer. say hi, schnozzie.}
<A>__{schnoz ignores them, sniffing a charred beam in a corner. t.j. points out burn patterns to glass.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{flame racer, partial p.c.l. see this wave pattern? definitely self contained.}
<A>__{pooch sniffs dirt, tastes it.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{nitro, dash of semtrex, vegetable oil ...}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{what kind of bomb was it?}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{device.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{we don't use the b word. bad luck.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{so you're the "device squad"... and you defuse "devices"?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{treat. we treat devices.}
<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{anything else i should know?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{don't push it, slick.}
<A>__{schnoz whines and paws at something under the beam. they scramble over.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{pooch, can you move it?}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<A>__{pooch positions himself like a weight lifter preparing to dead lift. he growls as he strains to lift the beam out of the way. glass and t.j. jump in and go to work with toothbrushes and tweezers. as reilly watches, fascinated, they uncover a scorched fragment of a briefcase handle.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{yes, baby, yes ...}
<A>__{pooch throws schnoz the red ball.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{good boy, schnoz. daddy loves you.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.}
<A>__{reilly looks to glass for an explanation.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{c4, plastic explosive.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{helluva fuck factor.}
<A>__{reilly again looks for an explanation.}
<C>__{t.j. }
<D>__{don't worry, you'll pick it up.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{hey, check this out?}
<A>__{something glitters in the ashes. pooch picks it up with tweezers. a tiny chip. the guys stare at it, puzzled.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{lemme see that.}
<A>__{glass takes it, puts on his magnifying spectacles, holds it up to the light, frowns.}
<C>__{glass }
<D>__{hardware.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{computer device?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{unlikely. probably, cash register or something.}
<A>__{pooch and t.j. go back to searching.}
<C>__{glass }
<D>__{what can you tell us about the girl with the exploding jewelry?}
<A>__{glass turns to see reilly on his way out.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{i will get back to you.}
