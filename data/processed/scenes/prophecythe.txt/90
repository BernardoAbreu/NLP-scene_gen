<L>__{interior the mine}
<A>__{the sun very quickly becomes a memory. and after the first bend it isn't even that anymore. there's only the glow of the flashlight; glancing off the abrupt edges of tunneled rock. here and there are the flotsam of a bankrupt industry; dented ore carts lying on their side, rusted drill bits, piles of support timbers. and all around them the sucking blackness of the earth.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{it's cold...}
<A>__{they walk further down into the mine. the atmosphere becomes close and creepy. thomas has been following tracks left in the dusty floor that abruptly disappear. he stops and sighs.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{ a bat suddenly shrieks out of the darkness, glancing off thomas's shoulder and tangling in katherine's hair. she screams and spins around, loosing her footing and half falling into a yawning ore chute she hadn't seen beside her. thomas rushes over and pulls her out. she climbs shakily to her feet.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{yeah... sorry.}
<A>__{thomas takes a last pass at the mine shaft with his flashlight.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{well, i've seen enough.}
<A>__{as he turns to leave the flashlight burns out.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{wonderful.}
<A>__{he bangs it once against his thigh before he notices for the first time a dim, amber light coming from a space between the rocks.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe a bum or something.}
<A>__{but his gun's out at his side. just in case. they follow the light to the gap in the rock, gingerly stepping into}
<B>__{a cavern}
<A>__{ that could easily belong to a bum. it's gabriel and jerry's digs. just the moldy blanket, single oil lamp, piles of twinkie wrappers, and something else. from outside the cave it's the same whine, the same blurryness that drips off gabriel like sweat. but once they step into the room, into the lair, it suddenly jumps in volume. this is where gabriel sleeps, and it's thicker here, like honey on the walls. thomas has difficulty focusing his eyes.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{do you feel it?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{...yes.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{but thomas can't hear katherine anymore, her voice has disappeared beneath the whine. as it becomes too much he leans his weight against the rock wall and shuts his eyes. it's then they come. flashes of images: of screams and fire. of impossible vistas of emptiness and death. and shrieking overhead, shrieking everywhere; grotesque, winged creatures with no eyes. some with faces we know; gabriel, simon, and the gargoyle. all these images are being jammed into both their minds by the cave. thomas forces his eyes open but the scenes playing all around him won't go away. tears are running down katherine's face as she stands there locked in the same images. thomas stumbles about the room as if drunk, the visions, incomprehendibly black visions of war and destruction on an alien plateau, eat his brain. he sinks to his knees and begins to cry.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{oh no... oh god no...}
<A>__{katherine's curled up on the floor like a child, weeping. the images are driving them mad. thomas, fighting the insanity pounding at him, crawls pathetically across the floor to the oil lamp. his fingers grasp it spasmotically as he rises to his knees and leans back.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{he heaves the lamp against the cave wall, where it explodes, the oil erupting into a swirling blaze that consumes the corner. the images break a second in the heat and light and sucking wind. just long enough for thomas to grab katherine's arm and pull her out of the room.}
