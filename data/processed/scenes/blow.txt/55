<C>__{george }
<D>__{rule one: don't fight. a trial will cost you a fortune in lawyer's fees and the jury will chop off your balls and hand them to you on a platter.}

<C>__{george}
<D>__{in all honesty, i don't feel like what i've done is a crime and i think it's illogical and irresponsible for you to sentence me to prison. none of the real criminals of the world ever end up behind bars. i mean, when you think about it, what did i really do? cross an imaginary line with a bunch of plants? you say that i'm an outlaw, you say that i'm a thief, but where's the christmas dinner for the people on relief?}
