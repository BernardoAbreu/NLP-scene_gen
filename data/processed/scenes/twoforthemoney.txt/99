<L>__{interior puerto rican mansion day}
<A>__{palatial. drapes dance before the open doors. music plays. brandon and walter sit in the living room. peaceful beat.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i start to die, fuck the hospital, just sit me down, i wanna kack here. a beefy bodyguard enters followed by a tan, broad shouldered man of 50. walter extends his hand.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{mr. novian! what can i say? an honor. this is my associate, john anthony. mr. novian nods, settles in a chair. walter and brandon sit.}
<C>__{novian}
<A>__{you should know i think that most sports services are a complete scam... however, i hear your boy here's having quite a season. what's your system?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{(looking around) our system? fuck that, what's your system? walter laughs. novian stone faced, glances at his watch when }
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{it's a privilege to meet you, mr. novian. you have a beautiful home. let's start with how much you bet.}
<C>__{novian}
<A>__{a million a game, across the board.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{nice round number, is that our ceiling here? is that the most we're working with?}
<C>__{novian}
<A>__{"we're" not doing anything until i hear how you feel about this weekend.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{do you rent that yacht out there?}
<C>__{novian}
<A>__{i own it.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{well, sir, that's how i feel about this weekend. that may sound cocky, i don't care. i didn't come down here to lie.}
<C>__{novian}
<A>__{do you have inside information?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{if i did i wouldn't share that with you. my record speaks for itself. the truth is i know these teams better than they know themselves. i'm going 12 for 12 this weekend, and that includes the monday night parlay.}
<C>__{novian}
<A>__{why should i believe you?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{with all due respect, mr. novian, you can't afford not to.}
<C>__{novian}
<A>__{i can afford to do any damn thing i please.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{can you? what i'm saying is can you can anyone for that matter afford to lose as much as a man like you probably needs to bet to feel a win? winning's a funny thing, mr. novian... it's one of those rare commodities on earth money can't buy. or was, until you called me. charged beat. a tight grin's glued to walter's face.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{the price is a quarter million, mr. novian up front in addition to a percentage of every game you win.}
<C>__{novian}
<A>__{fuck you. i never pay anything up front.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{and we've never charged it before. but with what you're betting,}
