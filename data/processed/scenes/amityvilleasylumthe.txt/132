<A>__{butch uses a lighter to boil a spoon full of heroin. on his right arm is a belt. he then loads the heroin into a syringe. butch tightens the belt and taps his arm. he sinks the needle into a prominent vein and plunges the heroin into his blood stream. his eyes sink and he lies back onto the crusty carpet of the apartment, staring up at the ceiling. from a bird's eye view we slowly move down towards butch. suddenly a chorus of voices chatter around his ears.}
