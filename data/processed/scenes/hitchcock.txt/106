<A>__{disarray on the set. martin balsam watches as saul bass, cameraman jack russell and a.d. hilton green argue about the best way to proceed with the staircase sequence. hitch is conspicuous by his absence. as they bicker we find tony perkins off to one side, sitting in his mrs. bates costume, unable to cope. he puts the wig back on his head. there, that feels better... balsam's finally had it with all the arguing. he walks off past peggy who's arriving with the phone.}
