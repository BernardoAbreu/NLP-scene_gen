<A>__{wills and charlotte lean down on the railing, watching the water purl and eddy around randall's island.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{did you know she was in love with you?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{she told me.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{were you in love with her?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{why? because she was the only girl in rhode island who wouldn't sleep with you?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{that's how she got my attention; it's not why i fell in love with her.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i fell in love with her because she charmed me senseless day and night for an entire summer.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{then why did you screw her best friend on labor day?}
<A>__{wills looks at her darkly. she smiles and shrugs }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{it's just a question.}
<A>__{wills sighs and looks away, reflecting }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i have no idea. the summer was over. your mom was going back to smith. i was moving down here to work on wall street. it was our last day together. she was crying. she told me, for the first time, that she loved me. i said i loved her, too. i promised to call and visit. a few hours later i was in a cabana with millie.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when millie told me she was pregnant and that she wanted to marry me, i escaped to l.a... and i never saw her or your mom again.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(wryly)}
<D>__{well done.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i think it's part of the reason i never came back.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{but why're you like that? what is it? i mean, you weren't born that way.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i might as well have been. for as long as i can remember, i've always run off at the first sign of a woman wanting anything from me... relying on me in any way.}
<A>__{she considers for a moment }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{but i want everything from you, wills. i rely on you in every way.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{so the only reason you don't dump me is because i'm sick? because you know that it's all going to be over, anyway?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{maybe. but it doesn't feel that way.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it feels as though i'm not afraid anymore.}
<A>__{she looks at him and smiles. he puts an arm around her and draws her close.}
