<T>__{quick cuts:}
<A>__{ carl and rooney downing more jello shots. carl and rooney drinking beers. carl and rooney are drunkenly staring at a nearby group of girls.}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{that girl is hot. or at least she seems hot. i'm kind of too drunk to tell. right now, honestly, you seem hot.}
<C>__{rooney}
<D>__{i am hot.}
<C>__{senor frog's waitress}
<D>__{another jello shot?}
<C>__{carl rooney}
<A>__{yes. i think i'm done. carl downs the jello shot. he stumbles a little.}
<C>__{senor frog's dj}
<D>__{senor frog's famous karoake contest is starting now! sign up and sweep us off our feet!}
<C>__{rooney}
<D>__{you gotta do karoake.}
<A>__{carl stumbles over to the senor frog's dj. he's losing control and he likes it.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{sign me up, bitch.}
<C>__{senor frog's dj}
<D>__{we've got our first victim... i mean, singer.}
<A>__{music cue: the opening notes of white town's "your woman" carl grabs the microphone and heads out into the crowd. (note to reader: as you read this part, i recommend listening to white town's "your woman." it will bring it to life in a way that words on a page cannot do it justice.)}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(singing talking with an odd english accent)}
<D>__{just tell me what you've got to say to me, i've been waiting for so long to hear the truth, it comes as no surprise at all you see, so cut the crap and tell me that we're through. now i know your heart, i know your mind, you don't even know you're being unkind, so much for all your highbrow marxist ways, just use me up and then you walk away, boy you can't play me that way.}
<A>__{carl heads over to the hot girl and begins serenading her. she thinks it's kind of funny.}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{well i guess what you say is true, i could never be the right kind of girl for you, i could never be your woman.}
<A>__{carl gets really close to the hot girl's face and then coyly pulls away for the bridge of the song. during the awesome bridge, carl does some fantastic dance moves. or rather, moves that you think are fantastic when you're drunk out of your mind. the hot girl laughs at his antics.}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{well i guess what they say is true, i could never spend my life with a man like you, i could never be your woman. i could never be your woman. i could never be your woman.}
<A>__{carl lands on one knee in front of the hot girl. the crowd cheers for him. the hot girl's large boyfriend gets up close to carl. everyone is very, very drunk.}
<C>__{brutish boyfriend}
<D>__{were you just flirting with my girlfriend?}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(re: the hot girl)}
<D>__{it depends is that your girlfriend?}
<C>__{brutish boyfriend}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{then yes.}
<C>__{hot girl}
<D>__{hey, c'mon. be cool. he was just screwing around.}
<C>__{brutish boyfriend}
<D>__{let me handle this, crystal.}
<P>__{(to carl)}
<D>__{so, you want to have sex with my girlfriend?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yes, i do. very much.}
<C>__{brutish boyfriend}
<D>__{are you starting a fight?}
<C>__{rooney}
<D>__{c'mon, carl, let's go }
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yes, i am.}
<C>__{brutish boyfriend}
<D>__{then bring it.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i will.}
<A>__{beat. carl doesn't really know what to do so he slaps him across the face the way a woman would slap a man.}
<C>__{brutish boyfriend}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{me bringing it.}
<A>__{the brutish boyfriend punches carl in the head.}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{i'm too drunk to feel! i'm like darkman!}
<A>__{carl headbutts the guy. they get into a dirty, drunken tussle. both of them are trying to hit the other one in the groin region. bouncers descend on them and pull them apart.}
