<C>__{julia}
<D>__{help me.}
<A>__{her voice is perfect. malahide stares at her, his fascination intense. he crosses the few yards that separate them. he looks at her, lying beside the hollow shell that was cheyney. her eyes stare back, brilliant, sparkling, alive.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{help me.}
<A>__{malahide realises her temporary vulnerability; all the life force she has absorbed from browning has made up her body, but it will take some moments for the strength to return to her. fascinated and sympathetic as he is however he cannot yet quite brine himself to touch this creature. instead he moves the mattress nearer to her, allowing her to crawl back onto it and lie down again. malahide stares down at her. he attempts a smile, but is too nervous to make it convincing. he is trembling slightly. this contact with the beyond is something he has dreamt of for years, but nevertheless the physical reality is overwhelming. julia treats him to the approximation of a smile. she is far from nervous. she studies herself. her figure is fully formed, her womanliness undeniable. all she is missing is a skin. she stretches her arms. she lifts her legs. she writhes on the bed in pleasure, like an x ray photograph of a calendar girl. malahide stares at her, following the sensual movements of her body. he swallows, a little embarrassed by his response to the naked display he is privileged to watch. julia's eyes twinkle at him.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{don't be embarrassed. you're my friend.}
<A>__{she looks away and continues her stretching and wiggling, more conscious of it now as an erotic display. the strength has flooded through her body as she rises to her feet, and stops off the mattress, smiling at malahide. malahide backs away from her as she moves towards him, doing his best to return her smile. after a few steps, julia stops and simply stares into malahide's eyes. he too stops and returns the gaze. the camera circles them slowly several times, studying them the dressed, nervous man and skinned, confident woman.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{malahide says nothing. perhaps he swallows nervously. the camera continues its circling movements. the scene fades to black and julia begins to laugh, small, sensual giggles at first building finally as the blackness comes into an almost hysterical crescendo of raucous joy.}
