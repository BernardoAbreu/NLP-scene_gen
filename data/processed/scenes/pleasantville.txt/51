<C>__{betty }
<D>__{do you want some more cookies?}
<L>__{interior kitchen.}
<A>__{david is at the kitchen table with a nauseated look on his face. there are three empty bottles of milk and cookie crumbs all over the table.}

<P>__{(sick)}
<D>__{oh no ... i'm fine.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{how 'bout some marshmallow rice squares?}
<C>__{david}

<A>__{there is a knock behind them at the door. david springs up.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{now who could that be.}
<B>__{following david.}
<A>__{he crosses into the foyer ahead of his "parents." david swings open the door revealing mr. johnson, standing on the porch.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh hi!}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{hi there. you took off so quick. i wasn't sure if you were okay.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh, yeah. sorry. i'm fine. i just ... had to get home early.}
<A>__{mr. johnson leans in closer and speaks in a confidential tone of voice.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{bud ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yeah ...}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{you know how when we close up, i close the register, then you lower the shades, then i turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yeah ...}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<P>__{(proud)}
<D>__{well you weren't around this time so i did the whole thing myself.}
<B>__{closer.}
<A>__{mr. johnson has a strange look of "manly pride" on his face. his shoulders square back. his chest puffs out a little. there is a sudden sparkle in his eye.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<P>__{(more confidential)}
<D>__{not only that, i didn't even do it in the same order. first i lowered the shades, then i closed the register.}
<A>__{he looks at david with pride then suddenly shifts his glance behind him.}
<C>__{mr. johnson }
<D>__{oh, hello betty.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{hello bill.}
<A>__{neither one says anything but neither one has to. david looks on in horror as his mother locks eyes with mr. johnson and his new found virility.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{well, look, thanks for coming by. i ... really appreciate it.}
<A>__{he turns and starts hustling him down the walk just as biff's convertible pulls up at the curb.}
