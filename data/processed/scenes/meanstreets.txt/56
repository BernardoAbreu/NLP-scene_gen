<L>__{interior restaurant mid day}
<A>__{charlie is sitting in a quiet corner of the restaurant. this restaurant was considered an above average business with quality and prices to match when it was first opened three years ago. the quality has diminished but the prices remain the same. as a result the place is dying. charlie is scrutinizing the restaurant from his corner. he picks up a water goblet and critically examines the water spots on it. he calls a waitress to show her the dirt on the glass. she apologizes, cleans it with her apron, and places it back on the table. he takes a menu. a chubby, middle aged man, oscar, approaches the table. he is half owner of the decaying restaurant. he is in his shirt sleeves which, along with the side of his face, are smeared with grease and dirt. he is tired and disgusted.}
