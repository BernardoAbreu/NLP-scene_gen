<A>__{at the far end b.g., toward the lobby, a single unshaded light bulb burns dully. a slight figure stands in f.g. to one side is a narrow u shaped alcove blanketed in heavy shadows. the features of the man in the hall and the slim lines of his body blend vaguely in the darkness. with enormous care, he turns a knob and opens the door leading to the alley behind the hotel. light thrown by the back windows reveals that the figure is pete. the same pallid light from the alley, glancing across the alcove, momentarily illuminates it. glued as close to the recessed wall as is humanly possible is doc. he is partially shielded by one of those hotel hose wheels around which an old fire hose is wound. the heavy brass nozzle of the hose hangs from the end. doc grips a twelve inch length of lead pipe. pete swallows nervously and peers outside, first to the right, then to the left. his eyes glaze with fear, and his jaw tightens with tension.}
