<A>__{meet rawlins. he's a young, jolly brit pink and overfed and quite shocked to see...}
<C>__{rawlins}
<D>__{mr. kane...}
<P>__{(hastily tidying up)}
<D>__{come right in... please... have a seat.}
<C>__{bourne}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{bourne just trying to feel his way through this...}
<C>__{rawlins}
<D>__{well...}
<P>__{(really thrown)}
<D>__{i must admit, when my assistant told me you were here i was, really i was quite i was surprised.}
<C>__{bourne}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{rawlins}
<D>__{we thought you were gone for good.}
<C>__{bourne}
<D>__{did you?}
<C>__{rawlins}
<D>__{well, i mean it's a tough business, isn't it? cutthroat.}
<A>__{a long awkward beat. neither of them sure where to go.}
<C>__{rawlins}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{look, our bid it was competitive but definitely at the high end of competitive when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.}
<P>__{(pitching now)}
<D>__{i'm assuming you're still in the market. it's the same vessel?}
<C>__{bourne}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{rawlins}
<D>__{we just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. gorgeous boat, hundred and seventy five foot pleasure cruiser. i think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as i said, a bit more competitive.}
<C>__{bourne}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{another beat. rawlins holding back until now...}
<C>__{rawlins}
<D>__{was it the break in?}
<C>__{bourne}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{rawlins}
<D>__{we also thought we hadn't heard from you we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.}
<P>__{(the meat)}
<D>__{our offices were broken into vandalism mostly shortly after we last spoke.}
<C>__{bourne}
<D>__{i hadn't heard.}
<A>__{rawlins smiles. reset. sales mode.}
<C>__{rawlins}
<D>__{let me get you a new copy of the proposal.}
<C>__{bourne}
<D>__{that'd be great.}
