<L>__{interior storm cellar stairs continuous}
<A>__{as they go, the temperature drops. a cold, damp sheen appears on their skin. then comes a thick glutinous buzzing sound.}
<C>__{tia}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{flies. the stairway walls are thick with furry black flies.}
<C>__{maurice}
<P>__{(stopping)}
<D>__{ugh. muchos moscos, man. this is too much.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{just some flies.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{some flies? i think this qualifies as way more than "some."}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{what a smell.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{hey, what you expect? where there's smoke there's fire. and where there's flies, there's shit.}
<A>__{the stairs end in a dark, damp dirt cellar and the remnants of the terminus of the old elevator shaft.}
<C>__{maurice }
<D>__{oh yeah, i guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{maurice, man, shut the fuck up.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{yeah, well, maurice is right. it's gonna take more work than i thought. but we can still do it. we'll lay a real floor in here. put damping on the walls. totally controlled sound. be perfect. no one could hear shit up on the street.}
<A>__{behind them the dog is digging in the dirt. furiously.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{yeah, perfect. really excellent. we can make our first record where no one can hear us scream. be afraid.}
<A>__{they're not paying any attention to the dog's incessant digging. only cinnabar is. she's staring at it.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{oh god...}
<A>__{and she sees, in the deepening muddy hole at the dog's paws, at first glimpses and then the full view, a rotted human corpse. really just a skeleton. with something sticking out of its chest. cinnabar shrieks, while the guys try very hard to act real cool.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hello. who're you?}
<A>__{maurice bends and pulls out the now blood rusted razor.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{boys and girls, moms and dads. children of all ages, i'd like you to meet... jimmy bones.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what the hell you talking about?}
<C>__{maurice}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"this is the story of jimmy bones black as night and hard as stones gold plated deuce, like the king of siam got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." there's the switchblade and there's the diamond. don't know where the deuce is parked.}
<A>__{he points to one of the bony hands. the left one. on the third finger is jimmy's big diamond ring.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you think that's really him?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{damn. it's so...fresh.}
<A>__{and he's right. oddly for an old skeleton, there are strands and bands of wet, raw flesh. maurice lifts the hand wearing the ring. he starts top pull it loose from the finger.}
<C>__{tia}
<D>__{boy, put that thing down. you can't take that. might be evidence.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{evidence of what?}
<C>__{tia}
<D>__{somehow i don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.}
<A>__{cinnabar sees something. bright color beneath the body. bends down to a piece of cloth poking out from beneath the bones. the dog growls viciously as she reaches down to the scrap of color poking up. tia restrains the hound the best she can.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{get your damn dog, girl!}
<A>__{the cloth is the corner of a dress...the dog suddenly lunges for cinnabar's hands, ripping at them. she pulls back.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{shit! damn dog. we gonna have to do something about you.}
<C>__{tia}
<D>__{what we have to do is call the police.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{right. call the police. we'll have no problem getting our permits then.}
<C>__{tia}
<D>__{we can't just leave it here.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{yeah, we can. least till after this weekend. he ain't going nowhere. we'll deal with it then.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.}
<A>__{they all start to leave except maurice and cinnabar. he's loitering by the body, eyeing the ring. she's staring into the dark corner of the sub basement.}
<B>__{her pov in the dim light}
<A>__{she sees something wavering, a shadow mirage, bones.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{cinn?}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{what? oh yeah. coming.}
<A>__{she follows the others upstairs. bones watches her form as she climbs the steps, and for a second from bones pov we see her mother, when she was young. bones looks now at maurice. who checks to see if the others are gone. then maurice hurriedly bends down, and while holding his face back away from the stench attempts to pull bones' ring off his finger. but it's stuck. he tugs again, harder, and rips the corpse's finger off.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{oh fuck.}
<A>__{oh fuck is right. bones' shadow rears as it sees this desecration. maurice slips the ring off the finger stump.}
<C>__{maurice }
<P>__{(to the corpse)}
<D>__{sorry, but you wont' be needing this.}
<A>__{he places the finger back by the hand. and pockets the ring.}
<C>__{maurice }
<D>__{or this.}
