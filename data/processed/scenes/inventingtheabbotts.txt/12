<A>__{the band improvises a fanfare as lloyd abbott and his wife, joan abbott, step up onto the bandstand. joan has the practiced poise of a former beauty queen (as if her smile had been surgically sewn onto her face). she has a tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and sleep a bit too little.}

<D>__{ladies and gentlemen i'd like to propose a toast in honor of our cause for celebration tonight the engagement of our daughter, alice, to mister peter vanlaningham.}
<A>__{he gestures to alice abbott and her fiance peter vanlaningham. alice is nineteen, the eldest and the prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three sisters. peter is the scion of a wealthy pittsburgh family. he and his bride to be smile and acknowledge the applause and ad libbed toasts. the band strikes up "i got the world on a string" and joan whispers something to alice alice goes over to lloyd and (despite his mock protest) pulls him out onto the dance floor. the guests applaud their uninspired box step; neither father nor daughter appear comfortable at such close quarters.}
