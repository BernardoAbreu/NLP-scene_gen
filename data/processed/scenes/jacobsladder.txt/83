<L>__{interior hospital night}
<A>__{suddenly a fluorescent light flashes overhead. normal hospital walls materialize instantaneously around him. a nurse enters the room followed by sarah, eli, and jed. they approach jacob who is lying in traction, suspended over a hospital bed.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{he's still pretty doped up. i don't think he'll be able to talk yet and i doubt that he'll recognize you.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i just want to see him.}
<C>__{jed}
<P>__{(eating a snickers bar)}
<D>__{dad. hi. it's us. we just found out.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you look terrible. does that hurt?}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{i will be outside if you need me.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{jake. it's me. we heard what happened.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(his voice hoarse, nearly whispering)}
<D>__{i'm not dead. i am not dead.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{no. of course you're not. you've just hurt your back. that's all. you're going to be fine. it'll just take some time.}
<C>__{jed}
<D>__{a month, they said.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(trying to joke)}
<D>__{you just hang in there, dad.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(smacking him)}
<D>__{that's not funny.}
<P>__{(she reaches over and rubs jacob's brow)}
<D>__{what a mess, huh? god i wish there was something i could do. i love you, jacob. for whatever that's worth. i do.}
<A>__{there is a sudden sound of "doctors" laughing. jacob jerks his head painfully, but does not see them.}
<P>__{"doctor" (o.s.)}
<D>__{dream on!}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(yelling at the unseen voice)}
<D>__{no! oh god.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{jacob, what can i do?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{save me!}
