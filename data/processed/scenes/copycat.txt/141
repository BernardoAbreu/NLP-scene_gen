<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{i gotta get something to eat, i haven't eaten all day.}
<A>__{m.j. goes... ruben can't find a desk to work at, and commandeers nikko's. he slams the kid into nikko's chair and cuffs him. kid starts to rattle his chairs, spew chinese epithets, then bends over the desk and, with his teeth picks up some paper, tries to shake it to shreds. ruben yanks the papers out of the kid's mouth, pulls the kid's chair from the side to the front of the desk, shoves the kid into place facing away from the desk, so that he can't do any more damage. then ruben can't figure out where he can work. at the next desk, where he has been working, mac rises.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{here... i'm finished...}
<C>__{ruben}
<P>__{(to kid)}
<D>__{i'm going to the coffee machine. hold the fort.}
<A>__{he moves off, the kid's eyes move calculatingly around the room. he twists against the cuffs, trying anything to get free, and discovers he can pull out the desk drawer. close up: the kid's free hand rifling through the drawer behind his back, finding the gun. pull back to show the kid. he is as ruben positioned him, his back pressed against the desk.}
