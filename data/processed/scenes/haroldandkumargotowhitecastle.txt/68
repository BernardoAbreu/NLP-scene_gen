<L>__{exterior bush near dark road}
<A>__{kumar is still peeing. suddenly, a creepy guy (from out of nowhere) walks over to him. the creepy guy unzips his pants and starts urinating in the same bush, right next to kumar! kumar looks at the creepy guy totally confused. the creepy guy simply goes about his business. it's clear that kumar wants to say something. he remains silent for a couple seconds, until he can't take it anymore...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{excuse me...i'm sorry, i just have to ask you...why are you peeing here?}
<C>__{creepy guy}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{why did you decide to piss here right next to me? why not that bush over there?}
<C>__{creepy guy}
<D>__{well, this looked like a good bush to pee on. why'd you choose this bush?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{nobody was here when i chose this bush.}
<C>__{creepy guy}
<P>__{(getting heated)}
<D>__{so you can pee here and nobody else can, is that it?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{i was just saying....}
<C>__{creepy guy}
<D>__{is this like your special bush or something?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{no, i just...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know what? forget about it. i'm not in the mood to get stabbed right now.}
<A>__{the creepy guy calms down. he and kumar silently urinate next to each other for about ten seconds, until the creepy guy subtly looks at kumar's package.}
<C>__{creepy guy}
<D>__{nice pubes.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{thanks.}
