<A>__{the canoes enter the white water and they're so light, they're jet propelled. canoe pov: eight foot wave racing in the same direction they are. they hit it straight on and it shoots over them and they're drenched by two waves coming from the sides. hawkeye & chingachgook paddle like fiends to get momentum and control. uncas' canoe same thing. when they crested the wave uncas hollers at them to "pull" and they do. as soon as they're through it, uncas slams the paddle in the water and makes the canoe revolve a hundred and eighty degrees in a vortex so that now it's going through stern first or the stern becomes the bow, so that uncas could pilot it a different way through a hazard of ...}
