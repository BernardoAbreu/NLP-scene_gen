<L>__{exterior ocean day}
<A>__{the raft floats on quiet seas. the sky is blue, with few high cirrus clouds so motionless they seem pasted on. chuck lies on the raft, sick and weak. suddenly, from the depths beside him, silently rises a huge shape. a sperm whale, still mainly submerged. the blow hole is near chuck, wet and pulsing like giant lips. the eye of the whale is only a few feet away. it looks upon chuck out of an intelligence deep and alien. he slowly comes to his knees and stares at it. the blow hole opens and whoosh, out shoots a geyser of fine spray which settles on chuck in a mist. the whale rises farther, dwarfing the raft. from the whale comes a deep sound like a foghorn. startled, chuck jumps back, rocking the raft. he catches himself, slowly reaches out and touches the whale. the whale blows again, drenching chuck in more spray. chuck touches the whale again.}

<D>__{you like that?}
<A>__{very slowly it drifts along with the raft.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{lost your mate?}
<A>__{we look right into the whale's eye. beneath the surface we can see the huge jaws open and close.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{you're beautiful. marry me.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{you idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.}
<A>__{very slowly the whale moves ahead of the raft, its vast body passing chuck.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{no, don't go. look, i've got fish.}
<A>__{chuck rips a fillet off the line and throws it in front of the whale, which ignores it.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{please don't dive. please.}
<A>__{the whale slowly sinks, then suddenly arches its huge back and heads straight for the bottom. for a moment, all that remains are the flukes, black and vertical against the dark blue sky. with one swoop, those flukes could destroy chuck and his raft. but they don't do anything except slowly sink. then it is gone. we are on chuck's face as he stares at where the whale had been, the surface marked only by a ring of concentric ripples that reach out and gently rock the raft.}
