<L>__{interior dr. lecter's cell day}
<A>__{chilton lounges on dr. lecter's cot, casually reading his large stack of private correspondence, and making notations with his gold pen on a little pad. another orderly mops the floor.}
<C>__{chilton}
<D>__{perhaps you should have been less specific about what kind.}
<P>__{(to barney)}
<D>__{stand him by the toilet. then leave us.}
<A>__{barney props the hand truck into position, then both orderlies go. chilton finishes another letter, sighs happily.}
<C>__{chilton}
<D>__{such a lot of correspondence! i can hardly wait to analyze it in more detail... but first things first.}
<A>__{tossing letters onto the cot, he rises, crosses out into the corridor, and bends to remove a small tape recorder from underneath clarice's desk. he waggles it triumphantly at dr. lecter.}
<C>__{chilton}
<D>__{i thought she might be looking for a civil rights violation in migg's death, so i bugged you... not a word to me in all these years, hannibal. then crawford sends his bit of fluff over here, and you just turn to jelly. it's too pathetic.}
<A>__{side angle two shot as chilton, back in the cell, leans tauntingly close to the front of dr. lecter's mask.}
<C>__{chilton}
<D>__{you still think you're going to walk on some beach, and see the birdies? i don't think so, hannibal... i called senator ruth martin, and she never heard of any deal with you. she never heard of clarice starling, either. they scammed you, hannibal...}
<A>__{close on dr. lecter's glittering eyes, behind their slits.}
<C>__{chilton}
<D>__{when crawford gets through milking you, he's giving you to baltimore homicide for the raspail murder. and they're preparing some special surprises for you right now, in my electroshock room.}
<A>__{dr. lecter's pov (framed by eye slits) first looking at chilton's moving lips... then lowering to his soft, white, inviting throat...}
<C>__{chilton}
<D>__{the starling bitch wants you to rot here, in this little box, till your teeth fall out and you're soiling diapers. you've seen the old ones, hannibal. they weep when their stewed peaches get cold. that'll be you, too. unless you trade with me.}
<B>__{favoring chilton}
<A>__{as he sits chummily on the table.}
<C>__{chilton}
<D>__{there never was a deal with senator martin but there is now. i've been on the phone for hours, hannibal, on your behalf. here's what you get: if you identify buffalo bill, and the girl is found in time, senator martin will have you transferred to brushy mountain state prison, in tennessee...}
<A>__{close again on dr. lecter's eyes as they shift restlessly, away from chilton then suddenly lock onto something. they widen with interest.}
<C>__{chilton }
<D>__{the governor has already agreed. you get books, a view of the woods, and plenty of exercise time...}
<A>__{dr. lecter's pov extreme closeup on the cot, carelessly left there, lying half hidden under the letters and the rumpled sheet... is chilton's gold pen.}
<C>__{chilton }
<D>__{and best of all, you'd be out of jack crawford's reach, forever. the senator will verify these terms on the phone, and guarantee them in writing...}
<B>__{back on dr. lecter}
<A>__{as he stares a moment longer at the pen, then shifts his eyes towards chilton. we can almost hear his brain clicking.}
<C>__{chilton }
<D>__{in exchange, i get your full cooperation in publishing a professional account of this my successful interviews with you. you publish nothing. and i get exclusive access to any material from catherine martin... so. do you accept my demands?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{answer me, hannibal.}
<A>__{a beat. dr. lecter is silent. chilton sticks his face into shot, almost intimately close to the mask. he is agitated.}
<C>__{chilton}
<D>__{you'll answer me now, or by god, you'll answer to baltimore homicide. who is buffalo bill?}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<P>__{(pause; then softly)}
<D>__{i will tell the senator herself. but only in tennessee...}
