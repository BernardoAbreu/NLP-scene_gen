<L>__{interior the rose theater day}
<A>__{thirty two years later. vendors hawk food and drink as they walk through the audience. in oxford's box oxford sits, francesco behind him, exhilarated by the scene below him.}
<B>__{in the galleries}
<A>__{marlowe, dekker and nashe are looking at their single sheet programs.}
<C>__{nashe}
<D>__{"henry v" by... no one?}
<C>__{marlowe}
<D>__{and why would any of you admit to trying to better me in a historical drama? comedy, yes, tragedy, perhaps. but never will one of you best me in historicals.}
<A>__{marlowe takes a swig of ale, and spots jonson coming to join them.}
<C>__{marlowe }
<D>__{or will we be seeing a most hysterical historical?}
<A>__{jonson sits next to marlowe.}
<C>__{marlowe }
<D>__{hmm? ben? waiting to see how it's received before you lay claim??}
<A>__{before jonson can answer }
<B>__{on stage}
<A>__{an actor, condell (40's), dressed all in white (even his face is painted white) enters stage. he is "prologue". he addresses the audience directly.}
<D>__{"prologue" oh, for a muse of fire, that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention. a kingdom for a stage, princes to act, and monarchs to behold the swelling scene! then should warlike harry, like himself, assume the port of mars, and at his heels should famine, sword, and fire crouch for his employment. can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of france?}
<B>__{in the galleries}
<A>__{jonson seems surprised. this is not what he expected. this is good.}
