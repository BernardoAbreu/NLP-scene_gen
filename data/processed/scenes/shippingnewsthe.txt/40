<L>__{exterior wavey's yard afternoon}
<A>__{quoyle and bunny climb out of the wagon. a small house, its grassy yard strewn with a phantasmagoria of painted wood figures, galloping horses, dogs balanced on wheels, a row of chrome hubcaps on sticks. a zoo of the mind. to one side, a table piled with crafts, ignored by... ...fifteen little kids running in all directions, like bundled, unbridled banshees. looks like fun. two harried mothers are trying to cope with the chaos. and there, under a tree... ...the honey haired woman quoyle had seen on the ferry. and in the rain. she is on her knees, tying the shoes of her vacant faced son. he trips and sprawls, but he is laughing. the woman smiles tenderly and tousles his brown straw hair. quoyle gets up his courage. walks bunny over to them. as we arrive, the woman looks up...}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{hullo. it's our first day, and i was wond...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{what's wrong with him?}
<A>__{quoyle freezes. she means, of course, the blankly staring boy.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{hey, how 'bout we ask what's wrong with you? there's nothing wr...}
<P>__{woman (to bunny, softly)}
<D>__{sure, there is. this is herry, and he has down's syndrome. it means he learns things very slowly.}
<A>__{oh. herry smiles at bunny. suddenly, wonderfully.}
<C>__{bunny }
<D>__{know how to be a dog?}
<A>__{she drops to all fours and starts yapping like a terrier. herry laughs with delight. tumbles down to the grass and does his impression of a chihuahua on speed.}
<C>__{bunny }
<D>__{he looks fast to me. maybe he's cured.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{the kids waddle off in their canine personas. alone with the woman now, quoyle is near catatonic. come on, brain!}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{which one of those women is in charge here?}
<A>__{the woman looks at him. clear cornflower eyes. as comfortable in silence as he is agonized. then, she squints out at the other women, desperately running ragged after the kids.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{neither of 'em. they're just moms.}
<A>__{oh.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{well, my lord, whoever runs the place should be giving this a little more attention.}
<A>__{she looks back at him, blankly.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you think.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{i mean, children need structure. no one's even guarding that craft table, they could be running around with scissors and get hurt.}
<A>__{the woman's eyes bottomless, unreadable. the silence excruciating for poor quoyle. he clears his throat.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{um. i write for the newspa...}
<A>__{but she stands. the grace and quickness of a jungle cat.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{well. i'd better get to work, i see. providing structure and all.}
<A>__{brushes off her skirt. he is in the dawning panic of beginning to realize...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{i'm wavey prowse, and this is my place. pardon our antiquated emphasis on individuality and the freedom to have fun.}
<A>__{heads off with a loose limbed stride. spins back around...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{oh, yeh. running with sharp objects? we save for tuesdays.}
<A>__{got it? he gawks like a stupid animal. nods, got it. she's already gone.}
