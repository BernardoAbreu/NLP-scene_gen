<A>__{under the credits, the camera pans slowly across the project, capturing the sober monotony, the endless straight apartment houses. seven o'clock in the morning.}

<L>__{interior. charlie's bedroom}
<A>__{the bedroom of a two and a half room apartment in the housing project. it is early morning, but the shades are drawn and the room is dark. camera moves slowly across the room, over the large double bed on which charlie and helen samson, a young couple in their late twenties, are sleeping. they are sleeping more or less on their sides, facing away from each other. one of helen's pajama clad legs projects from under the light covers. we close in on charlie's sleeping face. the alarm clock at a distant end of the room suddenly bursts into a soft relentless buzz. charlie's eyes open. there is a muffled movement at his side, and helen gets up on one elbow. then she sits up, rises, and pads barefooted a rather pretty girl in rumpled pajamas to the alarm clock and turns it off. charlie's head turns on the pillow so that he can watch her. she pads back to the bed now and stands at the foot, looking down at her husband. she produces a smile, then turns and shuffles into the bathroom where she turns on the wall switch. a shaft of light now pours into the bedroom. charlie sits up in bed. his shoes and socks are on the floor by his feet. he reaches down and starts to put them on. suddenly, from the recesses of the bathroom, helen's rather vague soprano lifts into the first lines of a popular song. then it stops as abruptly as it began. charlie's head slowly turns to look at the bathroom, back again to the business of putting on his socks. his face is expressionless, but there is no mistaking the sodden distaste he has for the world today. he just sits on the bed, a young man of twenty nine, clad only in his pajama trousers, one sock dangling from his hand, his head hanging, his shoulders slumped. behind him, the sudden noise of rushing tap water, then off. then his wife comes back into the bedroom. she is carrying a bath towel with which she is drying her face. finished, she drops the towel on the bed and begins to dress. a moment later, she pads around the corner of the bed to charlie's front. she is still barefooted and wears her pajama top, but she has exchanged the trousers for a half slip. charlie hasn't moved a muscle since the effort required to lift one sock from the floor.}

<D>__{you think it's too early to call my mother?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{charlie shrugs without looking up. helen goes out of the bedroom, into the little square of foyer where there is a telephone table with a telephone on it. she dials, waits. in the bedroom, charlie rubs his eyes with two fingers.}

<C>__{helen's voice}
<D>__{well, listen, ma, i got something to tell you. i'm pregnant.... yeah, pregnant.... of course i'm sure. i've got the report back from the laboratory.... no, you wouldn't know him, doctor axelrod.... second month. he says i can expect the baby in february.... well, grandma, act a little excited, will you? ... you bet i'm excited....}
<B>__{closeup of charlie}
<A>__{he is not excited. if anything he is miserable. his bowed head rises slowly. the eyes open. he stares abstractedly ahead for a moment. then he sighs a profound sigh of resignation. then his eyes close again, and his head slowly sinks back to its previous abjection.}
