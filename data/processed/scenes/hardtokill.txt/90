<A>__{storm has just finished a major aerobic workout and is now doing some strange martial aerobic type movements. he is sweating profusely and is dressed in a tiny black tank top and black sweat pants. camera pans over to a corner mirror and we see andy peeking through a crack in the door. she is enjoying this immensely. she seems to be fighting her feelings, and finally she puffs up her courage. having made some decision, she enters.}

<A>__{they stare at each other in quite a different way. this time it's obvious what andy wants, and storm probably wants the same thing. but he tries very hard to maintain his "one objective" in life to get very strong and win the upcoming battle. he looks at this woman who now 'looks more beautiful than anyone he has ever seen. storm throws down the light weights in his hands and walks up to her. he gently grabs the back of her head and pulls her hair back and kisses her on the mouth. she seems to explode with passion as she falls to the floor, pulling him on top of her. they roll in passion growing stronger and stronger. the camera pans to the mirror and we see andy's feet moving in delight.}
