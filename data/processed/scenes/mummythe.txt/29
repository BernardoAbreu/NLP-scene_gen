<L>__{interior labyrinth day}
<A>__{o'connell, evelyn and jonathan crouch as they make their way through a narrow, cobweb infested labyrinth. the short, squat warden can stand straight up. then they hear something and freeze. it sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls. they share looks. then slowly move forward. getting darker and darker as they go. the strange sound getting louder and louder. and then it stops. evelyn holds her breath. jonathan licks his lips. o'connell cocks his pistol. the warden farts. o'connell, jonathan and evelyn glare at him. anubis' chamber day they slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of an enormous half buried statue. the lower half of anubis. then they hear the sound again, coming closer now, from the other side of the statue. and closer. o'connell pulls evelyn behind him. and closer. o'connell raises his gun. and closer! o'connell leaps out. three horrible sweaty faces lunge at him. o'connell reacts. but doesn't pull the trigger because it's just the americans, their guns are up, cocked and aimed.}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{ya scared the bejeezus out of us, o'connell.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{likewise.}
<A>__{but nobody lowers their guns. daniels grins, the tough one.}
<C>__{daniels}
<D>__{this here is our statue,... friend.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{don't see your name on it,... pal.}
<A>__{and that's when beni, five diggers and the egyptologist step out of the shadows, all holding guns aimed at o'connell.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{ten to one, o'connell, your odds are no so good.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{i've had worse.}
<A>__{jonathan clenches a tiny derringer.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{yes, me too.}
<A>__{o'connell gives him a sideways glance. beni cocks his gun, grinning, he wants it to happen. the tension thickens. then evelyn gently takes o'connell's gun hand and pulls it down.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{let's be nice, children, if we're going to play together, we must learn to share.}
<A>__{evelyn pulls o'connell away. jonathan and the warden follow. beni and the americans slowly lower their guns, laughing. the egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs.}
