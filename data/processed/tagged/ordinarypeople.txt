<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i know what happens here is only between you and him, and...i like that, i respect that. and...he's better, i can see that. i am not trying to put you down, i just don't believe in psychiatry as a panacea for everybody.}

<C>__{calvin}

<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{well, you said you... thought you could shed some light on some things. what did you mean by that?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i don't know actually, i'm not sure, i think i meant in terms of conrad. you see, i knew something was wrong even before he tried to... to kill himself. but i thought that... it's clear that he's very smart. he's been an "a" student ever since he started school, and naturally i thought that ...intelligent people could work out their own problems.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{but you still feel responsible?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{yeah, sure i do. it's hard not to. it was luck. it was just luck that i happened to be there when he tried it. i could have been at a meeting. we both could've been away. it was luck!}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{you think of yourself as a lucky man, then?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{no! no. no. i used to. i used to think... that i was a lucky person... before... the "accident". mmm, i guess the whole of life is nothing but an accident, is it? what happens to you. i should do with it.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{that sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax attorney.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{yeah. maybe, maybe i am drifting a little. i can see myself, ...and i can see the two of them drifting away from me, and i just stand there watching.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{what would you want to do about that?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{something. i gotta do something about it. i don't know what.}
<C>__{calvin }
<D>__{i feel like i'm sitting on a fence, and i don't like it.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{and you see them as on ...opposite sides of this fence?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{yeah... no. i don't know. i see her not being able to forgive him.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{oh, i don't know exactly. being too much like her. people always think that she and buck are... were ...were alike. but it's really she and conrad. they were the only two that didn't cry at the funeral, you know? it's not easy for me to admit this but, uh... she didn't... his mother doesn't show him a great deal of affection. i'm not trying to put her down in any way at all. she is a wonderful woman, huh...}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{did she give buck much affection to ...buck?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{oh, god, yes, she loved buck! bucky got so much... i think what she felt for him was special. you know, he was her first born. that's not unusual, is it?}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{and you?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{me? i loved buck.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{what i mean is, your wife's affection.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{for me you mean?}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{mmm. she's very... no. there's no problem with her for me. we've been... we've been married nearly twenty one years. everybody loves beth. but, huh... for conrad, it's been difficult. he didn't talk about that? we don't know what happens here. it doesn't come up. i guess that's what it is. it's private here. isn't it?}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{mm hmm. very private.}

<C>__{beth}
<D>__{why do you want to remind me of it?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{because i've always wondered, in some needling way, what it mattered what i wore. i was crazy that day. we were going to our son's funeral. and you were worried about what i wore on my feet. i'm sure it sounds like nothing to you, but it sticks with me and i just wanted to ...tell you about it.}

<D>__{do you do that deliberately or is it just a reflex?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{well, you said "vacation", so i just assumed you meant him too.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i'm surprised you haven't felt the need to call him since we've been here.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i was gonna call him tonight.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(to ward and audrey)}
<D>__{hey, could we have a little drink before we head back?}
<C>__{ward}

<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{what you started.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what i started?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{what you started.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{ha! there's no point discussing it.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i think there is a pointerior}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{he controls you even when you are two thousand miles away.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{he isn't the problem.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{isn't he?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{no, he isn't. let's talk about what's really bothering you.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no, no. let's talk about what's bothering you. cos' that's what you want, isn't it?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{jesus, what have i done to make you so angry with me?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it's not what you've done, it's what you think i've done. you blame me for the whole thing.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no! i can't! and neither can you, and neither can anybody else! only maybe i'm just a little more honest about it!}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{well, stop being so godamn honest, and start being a little generous! and start thinking about him for a while!}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i don't know what he expects from me. i never have known.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{well, i will tell you what he expects!}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what? he wants me to throw my arms around him everytime he passes an exam? well, i can't do it! i cannot respond when someone says: "here, i just did this great thing. love me.". i can't!}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{all he wants... all he wants is to know you don't hate him. that's it.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{hate him? my god! how could i hate him? mothers don't hate their sons! is that what he told you? do you see how you accept what he says with no questions, and you can't do the same thing to me, can you?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i just try to keep this family together...}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(she shouts)}
<D>__{i don't know what everyone wants from me anymore!}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{beth, nobody wants anything from you.}
<C>__{ward}
<D>__{beth, listen. we all just want... cal, con, everybody, we just want you to be happy.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{happy?}
<C>__{ward}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{ward, you tell me the definition of happy, uh? but first, you better make sure that your kids are good and safe, that no one's fallen off a horse, or been hit by a car, or drowned in that swimming pool you're so proud of! and then you come to me and tell me how to be happy!}
<A>__{she leaves. calvin follows. ward and his wife just stand there.}
<L>__{interior jet day}
<A>__{beth stares away from calvin, as in a void. she sighs, closes her eyes; calvin turns away from the window, looks at beth and remembers... when they were happily dancing... [ to and fro twice] calvin in his plane seat, reflects.}
<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{beth checks a pile of mail. conrad comes in.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{i think i'm gonna turn in. dinner was good. really good.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{it's pretty early. you tired?}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{yeah. it was kind of a rough week.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i hope your grandmother wasn't too tough on you?}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{no. she was fine. i'm glad you're back.}
<A>__{conrad gives his mother a hug, but she is like made of stone. calvin sees it.}
<C>__{conrad }
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{beth remains transfixed as if she didn't know what it was all about. calvin sees it.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{beth is not sleeping, she looks up, sees her husband wrinkled pillow, but he is not in bed. she looks at the time, gets up, puts on a robe.}
<L>__{interior stairs night}
<A>__{beth goes downstairs, tying up her robe. she stops, hearing someone sobbing in the dark, in the dining room.}
<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{beth enters the dining room in the dark.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{calvin?}
<A>__{calvin is sitting at table in the dark, sobbing, his head in his hands.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{why are you crying?}
<A>__{calvin doesn't answer.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{can i, uh... can i get you something?}
<A>__{calvin mutters in a very low voice.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i don't...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<A>__{calvin sits back in his chair.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{calvin. what did you say?}
<A>__{calvin produces a very deep sigh.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{tell me.}
<A>__{calvin looks up at her with a sad expression.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{you are beautiful. and you are unpredictable. but you're so cautious. you're determined, beth. but you know something? you're not strong. and i don't know if you're really giving. beth is looking at him not knowing what this is about.}
<C>__{calvin }
<D>__{tell me something. do you love me? do you really love me?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i feel the way i've always felt about you.}
<A>__{calvin is disappointed by the answer, but not surprised, just sad.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{we would've been all right, if there hadn't been any ...mess. but you can't handle mess. you need everything neat and ...easy. i don't know. maybe you can't love anybody. it was so much buck. and buck died, it was as if you buried all your love with him, and i don't understand that. i just don't know.}
<A>__{calvin sighs.}
<C>__{calvin }
<D>__{maybe it wasn't even buck. maybe it was just you. maybe, finally, it was the best of you that you buried.}
<C>__{calvin }
<D>__{but whatever it was, i don't know who you are. i don't know what we've been playing at. so i was crying.}
<A>__{calvin is overcome by sadness}
<C>__{calvin }
<D>__{'t know if i love you anymore. and i don't know what i am going to do without that.}
<A>__{beth does not know what to say or do. she turns away and goes upstairs.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{beth enters, kind of reflects, then goes open a closet, takes out some luggage. a sudden burst of emotion overcomes her, she cries but does not seem to identify the emotion, then restrains it.}
<L>__{interior conrad's bedroom dawn}
<A>__{in his bed conrad is not sleeping. he hears the door of the house close, then someone walking outside on the gravel. he gets up, go look out of the window. ouside, a taxi leaves. he goes downstairs.}
<L>__{interior stairs dawn}
<A>__{conrad goes downstairs, curious. looks around, sees nobody.}
<L>__{exterior garden dawn}
<A>__{from inside, conrad finally sees his father in the garden, reflecting. patches of snow. conrad puts on his coat over his pyjamas, and joins him.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{dad?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{the yard looks smaller without leaves.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{dad? what happened?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{your mother's going away for a while.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{where? why?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{back to houston. then i... i don't know.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{why? what... i know why. it's me. isn't it?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{yeah, it is. it's my fault.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{don't do that! don't do that to yourself! it's nobody's fault! things happen in this world, people don't always have answers for them, you know.}
<A>__{calvin sits down.}
<C>__{calvin }
<D>__{i don't know why i'm yelling at you for...}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{no, that's right! you're right! you ought to do that more often.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{oh, yeah?}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, haul my ass a little, you know. get after me. the way you used to for him.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{oh, he needed it. you didn't. you were always so hard on yourself, i never had the heart.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{oh, dad. don't.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{no, it's the truth. i... i never worried about you. i just wasn't listening.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{well, i wasn't putting out many signals then. i don't think you could have done anything.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{no, no, no, i should ...i should've got a handle on it somehow.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{you know, i used to figure you had a handle for everything. you knew it all.}
<A>__{calvin looks at him and laughs briefly at himself.}
<C>__{conrad }
<D>__{i know that wasn't fair but you always made us feel like everything was gonna be all right. i thought about that a lot lately. i really admire you for it.}
<A>__{calvin is moved.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{well, don't admire people too much. they'll disappoint you sometimes.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{i'm not disappointed. i love you.}
<A>__{calvin looks at him, cries and takes him in his arms.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i love you too.}
<A>__{they hug each other. [ camera pulls back canon in d by pachelbel ] credits roll.}
