<L>__{exterior wall e's work site that morning}
<A>__{a series of "wall e at work" moments: cu of wall e's hands digging into garbage. cu of trash being scooped into his chest compactor. a cube lands by the cockroach. wall e discovers a bra in the garbage. unsure what it's for. tries placing it over his eyes, like glasses. tosses it in his cooler. wall e finds a set of car keys. presses the remote lock. somewhere in the distance a car alarm chirps. plays with a paddle ball. the ball keeps smacking him in the face. he doesn't like it. wall e discovers a diamond ring in a jewel case. throws out the ring. keeps the case. the jewel case drops into the cooler, then...}
<B>__{...a rubber ducky... ...a bobble head doll...}
<A>__{...an old boot...}
<B>__{...a trophy...}
<A>__{ wall e finds a fire extinguisher. activates it. foam blasts in his face. it's tossed far, far away from his cooler. wall e's shovel hand strikes something solid. faces a refrigerator much larger than himself. now what? cu on fridge door. a welding beam moves down its center. it emits from between wall e's split binocular eyes. the door falls apart in two pieces. reveals... ...a small plant in its early stage of growth. wall e is entranced. carefully, he extracts the section of earth around it.}
