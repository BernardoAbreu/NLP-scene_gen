<A>__{as schaeffer reaches samuel, shouts:}
<C>__{schaeffer}
<D>__{cut that out!}
<A>__{samuel looks at him, keeps on pulling. schaeffer quickly crosses to him, grabs him by the back of the neck, tries to pull him off the bell rope. samuel hangs on grimly. schaeffer yanks hard, succeeds in yanking samuel free, shoves him roughly aside. then schaeffer turns, fires a shotgun blast into the top of the bellrope. it still hangs by several threads, so he fires again. the rope drops to the ground. schaeffer reloads, turns to look at samuel, just getting to his feet. a moment... when schaeffer, recognizing samuel as the amish kid who saw mcelroy kill zenovich, perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness right then and there. but a glance toward the oncoming amish gives him pause. he snarls at sam:}
<C>__{schaeffer}
<D>__{get down to the house and stay there!}
<A>__{samuel gets to his feet, turns, trots off.}
<B>__{rachel}
<A>__{already halfway out to the barn, running to gather sam in her arms... then to lead him back toward the house.}
<B>__{schaeffer}
<A>__{turning, starting very slowly toward the barn.}
