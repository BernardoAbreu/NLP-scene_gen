<L>__{interior tip top diner day}
<A>__{quaint, midwestern eatery. knick knacks and photos abound. the booths and counter are packed with locals. a family dining section off in one corner. two guys sitting at the counter in team jackets. the older of the two holds up his empty coffee cup. but his waitress, standing a couple seats down from him, doesn't move. she's completely absorbed in watching the soap opera that plays on two battered, fuzzy tv sets. betty sizemore, 30, has a wholesome attractiveness that competes with a bit too much makeup and a cheesy white waitress uniform. two other waitresses attend to customers behind her. the younger of the two guys is involved in the soap opera. but the older one, still wants coffee. he gestures toward betty.}
<C>__{older man}
<D>__{miss?}
<A>__{betty leans forward, grabs the coffee pot and moves in front of him. without taking her eyes from the tv, she pours the java, which somehow lands in his cup without spilling a drop.}
<C>__{older man}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{very impressive. that is very...}
<P>__{(turning to others)}
<D>__{did anybody see that?}
<A>__{the local guys around him don't even bother to look up. of course, they've seen it before. betty smiles.}
<C>__{older man}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{thank you. could i bother you for a little more...?}
<A>__{before he can even finish, betty is topping him off with milk.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{skim, right?}
<P>__{(tears open an equal)}
<D>__{and half a pack, if i remember correct...}
<A>__{the older gentleman's mouth works a bit but nothing comes out. he is flabbergasted by her attention to detail. she looks at the younger man, who is still following the show and gobbling down a huge bacon burger.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{you know, you're never too young to start on a lean meat substitute...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you wanna try some turkey bacon on that?}
<C>__{younger man}
<D>__{you want a tip when i'm through?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{it's your body...}
<A>__{betty turns back to change pots. the older man watches her intently as the younger of the two mumbles to himself.}
<C>__{younger man}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{that's right, so why don't you get up off it...}
<C>__{older man}
<D>__{wesley...}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{i've told him the same thing. thanks for the suggestion.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{betty flashes the men a winning smile and moves off, one eye always on the tv as she approaches two local types. sheriff elden ballard, 32, a short, tightly wound little man, sitting at his own booth. ballard is spit and polish all the way: creases in his shirt, a glossy shine on his shoes. badge proudly displayed. he sits with roy ostrey, 31, a gangly, bookish local reporter. betty drops five ketchup packets and four mayonnaise packets on the table for him. another smile.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{hi, betty. you're looking good...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{thanks, roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. i liked your editorial this morning...}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{oh, appreciate it. i was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...}
<C>__{ballard}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{yeah, it was great. really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you know, elden, some people actually read more than just the classifieds...}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that lonelyhearts column?}
<P>__{(chuckles to himself)}
<D>__{i will take a refill there, betty...}
<A>__{his cup is full before he can even finish the sentence.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{hey, sheriff. how's everything?}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{... i meant your food.}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{oh, right... 's fine. thanks.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i thought you said the eggs weren't...}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{it's fine. mind your own meal...}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you should get the order you want.}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{and you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{it's no big deal, betty.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{there's yolks in there, huh? it's no prob'... gotta keep you on track.}
<A>__{betty grabs ballard's plate without another word, gives him a reassuring rub on the shoulders and moves off. he smiles appreciatively after her, then turns on roy.}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{why you always gotta embarrass me? i been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{they're just eggs, elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{... plenty}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{mind your own business. you just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...}
<A>__{still carrying ballard's plate, she returns to the counter.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{come on, guys, i told you it's egg whites only for the sheriff...}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{... i put him in that 'zone' thing. cook #1 well, it better be a pretty good size zone if he's in it...}
<A>__{betty and the cooks share a quick laugh. they move to change his order while betty glances up at the tv.}
