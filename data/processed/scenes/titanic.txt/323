<A>__{jack has climbed up on the bench, and is hugging the waterpipe. rose wades in, holding the axe above her head.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{will this work?}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{we'll find out. they are both terrified, but trying to keep panic at bay. he positions the chain connecting the two cuffs, stretching it taut across the steel pipe. the chain is of course very short, and his exposed wrists are on either side of it.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{try a couple practice swings. rose hefts the axe and thunks it into a wooden cabinet.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{now try to hit the same mark again. she swings hard and the blade thunks in four inches from the mark.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{okay, that's enough practice. he winces, bracing himself as she raises the axe. she has to hit a target about an inch wide with all the foce she can muster, with his hands on either side.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(sounding calm)}
<A>__{you can do it, rose. hit it as hard as you can, i trust you. jack closes his eyes. so does she. the axe comes down. k whang! rose gingerly opens her eyes looks... jack is grinning with two separate cuffs. rose drops the axe, all the strength going out of her.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{nice work, there, paul bunyan. he climbs down into the water next to her. he can't breathe for a second.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{shit! excuse my french. ow ow ow, that is cold! come on, let's go. they wade out into the hall. rose starts toward the stiars going up, but jack stops her. there is only about a foot of the stairwell opening visible.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{too deep. we gotta find another way out.}
