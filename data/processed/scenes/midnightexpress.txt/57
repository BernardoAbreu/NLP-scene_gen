<A>__{billy in a sweat, slips. a tense moment then he catches himself. off the train whistle can be heard, echoing into the shaft.mixed suddenly with loud talking off. arguing in turkish. billy freezes, signals upwards with a sharp hiss of breath.}

<P>__{voice #2 (off)}

<A>__{billy identifying the relative location of the voices, eases downwards, coming to a grill, looks in at: a basement room with furnace. two turkish guards throw the prison rubbish in the furnace, still arguing, ad lib. billy signals upwards. reverse angle, from inside the basement, of billy slipping past the grill, his face sharply illuminated by the flame of the furnace. off the walls around the grill we can see the giant silhouettes of the two guards still arguing. billy comes to the base of the shaft. a puddle of scummy water. unstraps the candle. a current of wind he peers around. p.o.v. a winding narrow catacomb, with beehive burial}
