<L>__{exterior crash ship night}
<A>__{cargo doors crack open. mixed for maximum flame, the cutter is pushed outside and swept around. fry appears behind it. moving like hostages, the survivors cross open ground, trying not to heed the primal sounds beyond their light. soon they reach... the main cabin. blackness inside.}

<A>__{he lifts his goggles. riddick's pov: checking the cabin. finding a lot of wreckage but no life.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{looks clear.}
<A>__{johns shoulders ahead and crawls in first. just as he stands up inside... a predator buzzsaws over his head , fleeing the cabin, taking off into the night.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{fuck me . you said "clear."}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{said "looks clear."}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{well, what's it look like now?}
<C>__{riddick}
<P>__{(rechecking)}
<D>__{looks clear.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{just get the goddamn lights on....}
<A>__{they scramble aboard. riddick tongue clicks behind johns. he isn't amused.}
