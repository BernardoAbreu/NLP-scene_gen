<L>__{interior hospital i.c.u. waiting room corridor evening}
<A>__{patrick's bouncing on his knees, speaking to arvel's parents, who are clearly stricken. arvel's father, stoic, holds his wife's hand. arvel's mother kneads a kleenex, her face etched with tears. patrick hugs her. stands up to see malakai frozen in the doorway, put off by the palpable grief. patrick crosses over to him. they retreat quietly into the corridor, their concern for arvel a shaky ground for conciliation.}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{why his mom's cryin' like that? arvel's gonna make it, right? that what's his nurse said. she told me herself, 'your friend's gonna make it.' did that bitch lie to me! talk to me, patrick! is he gone?}
<A>__{patrick steers malakai away from the waiting room, backs him against a wall and, in a gentle but firm way, holds him there.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{they just got bad news, man. they don't need to hear it again.}
<P>__{(trying to be strong; faltering)}
<D>__{arvel's fightin'. he's gonna pull through. thing is, when he does, they don't think... he ain't... shit. arvel ain't gonna walk again.}
<A>__{in that moment, whatever's left of malakai's soul crumbles. he looks at patrick with aggrieved disbelief and then a building anger. a stronger man would probably cry. patrick eases his grip. malakai straightens his body, cocks his head slightly. studies patrick in this crooked, derisive way.}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{i got a good reason now, man?}
<C>__{malakai }
<P>__{(off patrick's silence)}
<D>__{aw'ight, college boy. you do what you think is the right thing. i'ma do what i know is the only thing.}
<A>__{he starts to walk off, doesn't get far before patrick calls out.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{malakai...}
<P>__{(a fleeting hesitation)}
<D>__{... when it's on, i will be there.}
