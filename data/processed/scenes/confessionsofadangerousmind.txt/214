<L>__{exterior sunset blvd night}
<A>__{barris makes his way down the crowded street. people stare, turn their heads to gawk. we hear over and over again: "hey, isn't that chuck barris?" and "hey, look, the gong show guy!", and "chuckie baby, chuckie baby!" barris smiles wanly and nods. people shove paper and pen in his face and he scribbles autographs without stopping. sweat forms on his brow. his polyester shirt is drenched.}
<C>__{barris }
<D>__{she was right. what the hell had i done with my life?}
<A>__{among the fans on the street, barris spots the fat bachelor he killed in london. he sports a bullet hole in his head barris does a double take.}
<C>__{barris }
<D>__{wait, you're that guy. you're dead. this is screwy.}
<C>__{fat bachelor}
<D>__{i only want to be loved.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{that's all i fucking wanted!}
<A>__{barris hurries away from the fat bachelor. he begins to spot others converging on him: the corpses of those he killed, bloody and disfigured. crazy, angry looking gonged gong show contestants appear in the crowd with weapons. kgb agents in trench coats and sunglasses wield guns, day of the dead skeletons dance after him. barris breaks into a run. suddenly confetti and balloons pour down on him out of the l.a. night sky. barris dashes across the street, almost getting hit by a car. he ducks down an alley to catch his breath. as he leans against the wall and heaves, a middle aged woman appears, somewhat backlit by the street light.}
<D>__{middle aged woman mr. barris?}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{no, i'm... middle aged woman my name is louise wechsler and i'm here from tulsa with my family and...}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{please, i'm not feeling well. middle aged woman just a moment of your time. i love your show. and, well, i, sort of, have a talent myself.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{you can stop by the office to audition tomorrow.}
<A>__{the woman continues to approach.}
<D>__{middle aged woman well, i'm leaving tomorrow and i was just wondering. see, i dance a little and i was just wondering }
<A>__{there's no way out of this. barris sighs.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{yeah, all right. go ahead.}
<A>__{barris turns to face the woman, who's very close now. she starts to dance around, sort of ballet like, very badly. barris watches. she pirouettes, arms above her head.}
<C>__{barris }
<D>__{very nice.}
<A>__{something in her hand glints in the light. barris reflexively grabs her arm. it's an ice pick. the two wrestle for it. the woman is extremely strong. barris jams the palm of his hand up into the woman's nose. she staggers back, but doesn't drop the ice pick. barris leaps at her. the two roll on the ground. the woman pins barris. she straddles him and is about to stab him through the air. barris reaches under her skirt and grabs her crotch. the middle aged woman is a man. he screams in a distinctly male voice. barris takes the moment of distraction to grab the ice pick and jam it up through the assailant's chin and into his brain. the assailant slumps over. barris pushes the body off himself, kneels beside it, and pulls off the wig. he gets up, shaking and heaving. he looks at the body one more time, kicks it in the head with all his might.}
