<L>__{interior stunt tracks front 1 4 car}
<A>__{the train whizzes overhead, grazing his horn stumps, making sparks fly!! after the train passes, hellboy sits up, forehead smoking. sammael is gone. a trail of goop is glowing. he follows it, until it ends abruptly. he looks ahead: no trace of sammael... then a fat drop of glowing goop hits his hand.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{aw, i forgot }
<A>__{he looks up. sammael hangs from the ceiling, then drops. then the creature lifts hellboy in a ferocious bear hug. hellboy twists around and cracks open the jaws of the creature, like king kong and the t rex. sammael staggers back and in an impossible maneuver, re knits his jaws together! then he uses his bone scythe to tackle hellboy and tchakkkk!! pin his shoulder down. a deep wound. sammael's mouth starts to open! hellboy looks at the sparking third rail a few feet away. sammael's tongue rears back, a snake ready to strike.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{screw you.}
<A>__{hellboy grabs the rail. an electrical discharge consumes both creatures and burns the frame like flashpaper. hellboy lets go, his hand and body smoking. sammael very crispy is convulsing in a cloud of smoke. he grows still. wreathed in smoke, hellboy shakes off the shock and uses a flame on his arm to light a cigar.}
