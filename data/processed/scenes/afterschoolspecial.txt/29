<L>__{exterior coop's house back yard later}
<A>__{deacon wanders out back. it's very dark and there are several people in the pool, including jake's good looking friends, kelly, wendy, j.t., and mark. it's hard to tell in the dark water, but it looks like they might not be wearing any clothes. deacon sees this and starts to walk away.}
<C>__{j.t.}
<D>__{deacon. i heard it was your birthday. come on in the pool, man.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no, that's okay.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no, seriously. it's cool.}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(come hither)}
<D>__{come on, deacon.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{yeah. come on.}
<A>__{deacon thinks about it. he takes the metaphorical plunge.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{he slips off his shoes and takes off his shirt. he walks over to the shallow end. deacon steps in with his shorts still on.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{dude, what are you doing? take off your clothes.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{we're skinny dipping, deacon.}
<A>__{he hesitates, not sure what to do.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{oh. okay. sorry, i will just leave you guys alone then }
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{ no, come on in. join us.}
<A>__{wendy swims into j.t.'s arms. her shoulders rise above the water and you can just make out the top of her breast.}
<B>__{deacon}
<A>__{looks at her, thinks it over, and finally... slips off his shorts. he gets into the pool in his underwear, then slips them off, too, and throws them on the side of pool.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{wow. this feels amazing.}
<A>__{someone splashes kelly, she giggles, and the other kids swim around. kelly swims by deacon seductively and he smiles.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{coop's doing funnels. come on.}
<A>__{it's jake, by the side of the pool with deacon's clothes. the other people swim to the front, and get out of the pool... ...wearing clothes! even wendy, in a strapless bra.}
<C>__{j.t.}
<P>__{(rubbing it in)}
<D>__{sorry, dude.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{hey, give me back my clothes!}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{freakin? i can't see you. maybe i need to turn on the lights.}
<A>__{and he does. the backyard lights go on illuminating the scene. deacon panics. people start looking at him, laughing. then, the cheesy colored pool lights come on, flashing slowly. deacon is humiliated. jake bends down to whisper to deacon.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{did you really think naomi was into you?}
<A>__{deacon doesn't respond. but it's not enough for jake. he picks up deacon's underwear with a stick and examines them.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{oh my god! skid marks. aaaahhh, deacon shit his pants again!}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no, i didn't! give them back!}
<A>__{jake does a victory lap around the pool with deacon's underwear on the stick. everybody is laughing.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{sphincter boy shit his pants!}
