<L>__{interior dussander's house day}
<A>__{dussander's home is what you would expect of a single, poor, old man. nothing fancy, nothing out of the ordinary. todd looks around, perhaps half expecting to find a nazi flag or an oil painting of der fuehrer hanging above the mantle. but he doesn't, and moves into the living room where an old picture of a woman sits framed on an end table.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{my wife. she died in 1955 of lung disease. at that time i was working at the menschler motor works in essen. i was heartbroken.}
<A>__{todd's attention drifts away and his fingers slip over to a lampshade next to the photograph. he begins to feel it as though he were inspecting it for something.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{stop that!}
<A>__{todd jumps back a little but then recovers.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{tell me, wasn't it ilse koch who made the lampshades out of human skin?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{now i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{sure you do, mr. dussander.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{denker. denker. denker. you don't listen, boy. the television has fried your brain.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{your hands are shaking.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{yes, they're shaking. i'm old. we all shake. you are most tiresome, and rude. now if you have a point i wish you'd come to it.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{we're in no rush. if i thought you had plans, i'd say cancel them, but since i know you don't...}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you know nothing of my business }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what business? you sit in that ugly chair and watch soap operas all day. except on friday afternoons when you walk down to the movie theater. and twice a week you take the bus downtown to do your shopping. you always use the express lane because you never have more than ten items.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you have been following me?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{of course, i followed you. you think i normally go around to peoples' houses and accuse them of being nazi fugitives?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{perhaps for me you made an exception.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no, for you i had to be sure. for kurt dussander i had to be absolutely certain. ...now, i am, and that's why i'm here.}
<A>__{todd sits on the sofa.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{oh, yes, i see now. as i am this ex nazi fellow, as you say, then this must be the part where i offer you my hidden stash of gold, taken from the mouths of old jewish men, of course, which i keep buried in the basement. isn't that right, boy? well, i'm afraid you're wasting your time. i have no money. if i did i might even give you some just to be done with this nonsense.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i don't need money. you don't have any anyway. at least, i don't think so. you probably had to spend it all to sneak in the country. a good american passport is expensive on the black market, that i know.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{do you? good for you.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yes, i do. i know it all, dussander. you're my one great interest.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{your what?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{my one great interest. well, not you personally, but, ...well, it's something i learned back in eighth grade. our teacher, miss harmon, she said we'd have to find our one great interest in life. you know, the thing that would really grab us. once we did that, everything would fall into place. like hers, she said, wasn't teaching, but collecting nineteenth century postcards. i guess there's no money in that, so she has to be a teacher. anyway, she told us to start thinking about it. so i did, but nothing happened. until the following summer, in ronny pegler's garage. that's where i found it.}
