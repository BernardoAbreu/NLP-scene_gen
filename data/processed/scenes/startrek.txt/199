<L>__{exterior delta vega planet surface day}
<A>__{a fucking blizzard. kirk and spock prime move through the maddening whiteout. kirk yells through it:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i am so pissed off at the other you right now!}
<A>__{and spock points an outpost half a mile away.}
<L>__{interior starfleet outpost day}
<A>__{long tile corridor. the door at the end opens snow and wind as kirk and spock prime enter. door closes. silence again.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{... hello?!}
<A>__{echo. nothing. they head down. after a beat, a small, dark, oddly alien creature steps out. eyes them curiously. this is}
<B>__{keenser.}
<C>__{keenser}
<D>__{... can i help you?}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{are you the station chief?}
<A>__{keenser looks them over. then:}
<C>__{keenser}
<D>__{... no. this way.}
<A>__{and they follow keenser into a massive warehouse, filled mostly with junked space parts. a large, tarped shuttle in the background. in the middle of the huge, depressing space is a table. and a starfleet officer who is asleep, legs kicked up, leaning back in a chair, a hat covering his face. keenser taps the officer's boot.}
<C>__{starfleet officer}
<D>__{hm.}
<C>__{keenser}
<D>__{visitors.}
<A>__{a beat and the officer peers from under his hat. a cool, slow burn.}
<C>__{starfleet officer}
<D>__{you realize how unacceptable this is.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{spock prime}
<P>__{(re: the officer)}
<D>__{... fascinating.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{officer stands, unhappy about something. keeser watches nearby }
<C>__{starfleet officer}
<D>__{i'm sure it's no' your fault, and i know youse lads are just doing your jobs, but could you no' have come a wee bit sooner?!}
<C>__{starfleet officer }
<D>__{six months i've been living on nothing but starfleet protein nibs and the promise of a real food delivery! six months, boys! it's pretty clear what's going on here, isn't it? punishment! ongoing! for something that was clearly an accident!}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{you're montgomery scott.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you know him?}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{yes, that's me scotty you're in the right place are there any other hard working and equally starving starfleet officers around?}
<C>__{keenser}
<D>__{me.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{you eat nothing. a bean and you're done for a week, i need food. and now you're here so. thank you. where is it.}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{you are in fact the mr. scott who postulated the theory of trans warp beaming.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{yes! that's exactly what i'm talking about! how d'ya think i ended up here? i got into a debate with my instructor on the issue of relativistic physics as they pertain to subspace travel... he seemed to think that the range of transporting say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few hundred miles so i told my instructor i could not only beam a bird from one planet to an adjacent planet in the same system which is no big deal anyway but if i were so inclined i could actually do it with a lifeform! so i tested it on admiral archer's prize beagle. which... was a mistake.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i know that dog. what happened to it?}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{i will tell ya when it reappears. dunno. feel guilty.}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{what if i told you your trans warp theory was correct? that it is indeed possible to beam onto a ship that is travelling at warp speed. and that you only required the correct field equation to recrystallize dilithium?}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{i haven't been stationed here that long. if such an equation had been discovered, i'da heard.}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{the reason you haven't heard of it, mr. scott... is because you haven't discovered it yet.}
<A>__{kirk reacts. scotty reacts is almost spooked sobers up a bit... really regards spock prime. skeptical. amused.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{y'from the future, are ya? brilliant. d'they still have sandwiches where you're from? piece and jam? mince 'n tatties? cockaleekie soup?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what is he talking about?}
<C>__{keenser}
<D>__{food.}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{allow us access to your shuttle... and i will show you what a genius you actually are.}
<A>__{off scotty, who can't help but be intrigued }
