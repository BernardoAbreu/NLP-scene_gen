<L>__{exterior jacuzzi night}
<A>__{the party's over. ted relaxes in the jacuzzi, sipping champagne. thrilled, elated, blasted. uncle billy sits across from him. two masseuses tenderize their shoulders. but as the scene continues the women take an even greater interest in each other. stealing a kiss here. a touch there. ted attention is distracted as he chats with uncle billy.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{i told you you could do it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i was like a different person tonight.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{you were the new and improved you.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i would have been laughed right out of xenia.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{no one will be laughing at you now, ted. you can take that to the bank.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{you are home. but go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. in the meantime, i will be your point person here on the magazine.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{really? you'd do that for me?}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{i've been very lazy for a long, long time.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you seem like you're anything but lazy, uncle billy.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<P>__{(confiding)}
<D>__{i never finished school myself. never had to. my brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. he gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. i never struggled for a second.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{my parents always say hard work builds character.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{it's not like i didn't have ideas, i had plenty of ideas. but i never even shared them with your father. never had the guts.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what kind of ideas?}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{well...for one thing...i think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you think we should be more open minded?}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{the world is a big, beautiful place. we can open new markets in africa and asia. imagine the dali lhama reading our magazine.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{in other words, our scope is too narrow.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{at our press conference tomorrow, i think we should announce our plans to explore the world. not just a few leggy 36d's, with blond hair upstairs and down.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's perfect.}
<A>__{the masseuses help uncle billy out of the jacuzzi. they say their goodnights and ted closes his eyes. when he opens them, ginger stands at the edge of the tub.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{want some company?}
<A>__{ted can barely nod. she unzips the back of her dress and lets it fall to her feet. the silhouette of her nude body is startlingly gorgeous in the moonlight. ted watches as she descends, step by step, into the frothy water. ted's paralyzed with desire and fear. ginger descends deeper. a wash of foam caresses her breasts. she continues. until she's completely submerged. ted looks startled. the "jaws" theme echoes through his ears. he starts to rise. concerned. when suddenly, he feels something. whoa! his swimming trunks land next to him. he starts to rise out of the jacuzzi, when suddenly he's sucked under. he thrashes. his hand grabs the edge of the jacuzzi. but his fingers give out. and he slides under. only to rise out of the water with ginger. attached to his lips. kissing him passionately.}
