<A>__{we're now at street level, as lester runs toward us. he carries a walkman and wears earphones, and we hear rock music as he runs. the endorphins have kicked in, and lester grins, reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body.}

<A>__{the blender grinds as lester, still in his sweatpants, makes himself a high protein shake. he's in excellent shape; even his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident, easy swagger of an athlete. jane watches him blankly from the kitchen table. carolyn enters. lester leans against the counter, drinking his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her. he's got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable, and he knows it. carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup, avoiding his eyes, and starts out.}

<D>__{what are you talking about? i've barely even spoken to her.}

<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(angry himself)}
<D>__{you better watch yourself, janie, or you're going to turn into a real bitch, just like your mother.}
<A>__{jane is stunned. she quickly rises, trying to get out of the kitchen before she starts crying. angle on lester, and the immediate regret in his eyes.}
