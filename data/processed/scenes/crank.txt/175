<A>__{doc is calling from the broken down apartment we saw earlier. chocolate is kicking back on a worn, brown imitation leather sofa in the background, watching tv.}
<C>__{doc miles}
<D>__{i’m at my office. can you get here?}

<A>__{sirens approach outside. chev meets eve’s eyes, shakes his head: unbelievable.}

<D>__{sure, why not?}

<L>__{int chocolate’s apartment, 9 minutes later}
<A>__{an iv bag bubbles, a portable heart monitor beeps. the camera follows the drip down to chev’s arm. he’s lying on the brown sofa, wheezing thickly. some kind of court tv show plays on the tube in the background. doc miles crouches beside chev, examines the heart monitor, shakes his head.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{i owe you again, doc.}
<C>__{doc miles}
<D>__{you’re my best customer.}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(gesturing with his head at the iv)}
<D>__{what is this stuff?}
<C>__{doc miles}
<D>__{synthetic ephedrine, diluted with saline.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{it feels sort of good.}
<C>__{doc miles}
<D>__{oh, i also gave you a little meth. that’s the endorphins rushing into to your brain that you’re feeling.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{so i’m not... better?}
<C>__{doc miles}
<D>__{fuck no. you’re in such shit shape it’s stunning. i’ve never seen a heart take this kind of punishment and keep ticking. you should be in a fucking medical journal or something.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{so... what are you going to do?}
<A>__{doc just shrugs.}
<C>__{doc miles}
<D>__{the solution i’m giving you is acting as a competitive inhibitor... meaning it pushes the poison out of your receptors and replaces it with a chemical... it’s a temporary fix...}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{then what?}
<C>__{doc miles}
<D>__{look, if we put you on life support we could maybe string you out for a few days, but at some point you'd almost certainly lapse into a coma... and then...}
<A>__{and now it hits chev for the first time: this is really it. he seems like he might break down.}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(cocking his head toward the next room)}
<D>__{does she know?}
