<L>__{38 interior farm shed night 39}
<A>__{angle: a head encased in a hood. the hood is pulled off, revealing darby eyes wide, lying on a rough table. benson clyde leans over him, checks his pupils.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{can't speak?}
<A>__{he displays the prop gun rigged with the needles.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{tetrototoxin. fascinating stuff. it paralyzes you, but leaves all other neurological functions intact.}
<A>__{he sets the gun down, starts rooting through some instruments that darby can't see (though he's straining to).}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{that means you can't move. or talk. but you can see. hear. feel.}
<P>__{(busying himself)}
<D>__{that last one's important. feel. you can feel everything.}
<P>__{(glances at bottled drugs)}
<D>__{got some other items here. drugs to revive you in case you pass out. stuff like that.}
<A>__{darby almost manages to speak, thrashing weakly. clyde leans over, checks his pupils again.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{wearing off a little. no worries.}
<A>__{he tucks a padded block under darby's head like a pillow, raising his head so he can see better. clyde moves down the table, tightens straps holding darby down. but the worst part: tourniquets are tied on darby's arms and legs at various points. darby sees them and starts hyperventilating.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{oh. these. don't want you bleeding out. this will take a while.}
<A>__{clyde puts on a thick coat, like a meat packer's. he returns, sorting implements, darby trying to see. clyde obliges him, holding things up:}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(pliers)}
<D>__{teeth.}
<P>__{(hacksaw)}
<D>__{balls.}
<P>__{(bolt cutter)}
<D>__{fingers. maybe toes.}
<P>__{(scalpel)}
<D>__{eyelids. in case you insist on shutting your eyes.}
<A>__{darby's screaming but with the tetrototoxin in his system, all that's coming out is air, like a slow leak. clyde picks up an object, unfolds it a full body plastic coat. he puts it on over his other coat, as:}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{earlier on the phone? i said i'd get you out? you asked me what it would cost? well.}
<A>__{he finishes buttoning up, crosses back to the table, raises a new object into view: a circular power saw.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{we'll start with an arm and a leg. go from there.}
<A>__{pause. the reality of what he's about to do washing over him:}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i've been waiting to say that line for years. but it wasn't very funny, was it? no. played much better in my head. maybe it's my delivery.}
<A>__{he puts a construction site face protector atop his head, the kind with a full plastic face shield that can be flipped down. he turns and undoes the slipknot of a laundry cord stretching up to the ceiling. he feeds the cord and a full length mirror tilts down horizontally above the table. darby finds himself staring straight up into it he'll see everything.}
<B>__{angle from behind video camera}
<A>__{the camera's lcd screen looms large in our shot. the lcd is dark, the camera inactive. it's mounted high on a tripod, aimed down at the table. clyde approaches b.g., pauses.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{gosh. my heart's beating. you?}
<A>__{he flips his visor down dark, no face visible. he reaches up, turns the camera on. the lcd screen activates. angle closes in until all we see is: the lcd image. grainy in low light. clyde, now faceless behind the visor, crosses to the squirming figure on the table. we hear the circular saw build to a high shriek...}
