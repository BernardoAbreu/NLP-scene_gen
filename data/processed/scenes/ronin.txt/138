<A>__{a wispy fog atmospherically rises off the river not too thick, not too thin. a title: one month later... we're moving along the cobble stone walk next to the river as a voice cuts through the fog.}

<D>__{would you just smoke already...}
<A>__{a riverside cafe where sam, vincent and deirdre are having morning coffee. a mostly healed vincent is smoking a cigarette, trying to get sam to light up.}
