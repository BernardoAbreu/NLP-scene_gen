<A>__{carnegie sits at his desk, still in shock. eli's bible sits open on the desk before him.}
<B>__{a braille bible.}
<A>__{claudia is ushered in by a guard.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{he rushes forward and thrusts the bible into her hands.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you told me once that you know how to read this. this blind language.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{well, a long time ago, when i was a little girl...}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you're going to read it for me. every word. and i'm going to write it down. start at the beginning.}
<A>__{as carnegie hunts on his desk for a paper and pen, claudia opens the book and trails her fingertips across the raised lettering. for a moment there is a glimmer of recognition... a faint smile... but then it fades as carnegie turns back to her, eagerly clutching the writing materials.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's been so long. i don't remember. i don't remember any of it.}
<A>__{carnegie is aghast. beat as the anger swells within him, threatening to explode...}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{god fucking dammit!}
<A>__{he swipes violently at the bible, knocking it out of claudia's hands. he grabs it up and tries to rip it in two, but it's too thick to tear. red faced with rage, he tosses it out over the box balcony. it lands somewhere in the dark auditorium below, between the rows of gutted theater seats. as he paces angrily back past claudia:}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{bill, is there something }
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{just go. just get out of my sight.}
<A>__{he slumps in his chair, exhausted and furious. claudia sadly turns and leaves him alone with his thoughts.}
