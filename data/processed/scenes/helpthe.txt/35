<A>__{skeeter sits on a huge sack of flour. a millennium's supply of can goods fills the shelves.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{i was...well, i was raised by a colored woman. i've seen how simple it can be and...well, how complex it can be, too...between the families and the help.}
<C>__{miss stein}
<D>__{continue.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{i'd like to write something from the point of view of the help. these colored women raise white children, and then twenty years later those children become the employer. it's that irony, miss stein, that we love them and they love us yet...we don't even let them use the toilet in the house.}
<A>__{miss stein's swivels her chair back around and sits up.}
<C>__{miss stein}
<D>__{i'm listening.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{margaret mitchell glorified the mammy figure who dedicates her whole life to a white family but no one...ever asked mammy how she felt about it. there is both undisguised hate for white women and an inexplicable love, but nobody ever talks about it down here.}
<C>__{miss stein}
<D>__{so, a side to this never before heard.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{charlotte knocks on the pantry door.}
<C>__{charlotte }
<D>__{skeeter, who are you talking to in there?}
<A>__{skeeter covers the mouth piece and opens the door.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{go! away!}
<A>__{skeeter slams the door.}
<C>__{skeeter }
<D>__{so, yes, their side of the story.}
<A>__{skeeter leans back against the shelves.}
<C>__{miss stein}
<D>__{who was that?}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{my mother. she just dropped by to }
<C>__{miss stein}
<D>__{look, no maid in her right mind would ever tell you the truth. that's a hell of a risk in a place like jackson, mississippi. i watched them try to integrate your bus station on the news. oy! they jammed fifty five negroes in a jail built for four.}
<A>__{skeeter panics.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{i already have a maid.}
<A>__{skeeter can't believe what just came out of her mouth. miss stein rises and sits on the edge of her desk.}
<C>__{miss stein}
<D>__{really? a negro maid has already agreed to talk to you?}
<A>__{skeeter blinks hard. no turning back now.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{yes, ma'am...}
<C>__{miss stein}
<D>__{well...i suppose i could read what you come up with. the book biz could use a little rattling.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{you'd do that?}
<C>__{miss stein}
<D>__{i'm saying i will let you know if it's even worth pursuing.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{oh, thank you, miss stein!}
<C>__{miss stein}
<D>__{and for god's sake, you're a twenty four year old educated woman. go get an apartment.}
<A>__{she hangs up.}
