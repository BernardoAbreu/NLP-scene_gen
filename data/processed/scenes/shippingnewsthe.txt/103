<L>__{exterior omaloor bay day}
<A>__{sunlit day of crystal perfection. the majesty of ice and towering rock and shimmering water. a scale so majestic, any cynic would be hard put to deny god's hand. and gliding into frame... ...a tiny skiff. on its maiden run. we close to see... ...painted on its side. the four women. one woman is rowing just now, doing all the work. her son sleeps in the bow. and in the middle of the little boat... ...father and daughter. are unpacking the picnic lunch. there is a lot of food. this could take awhile.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{that's a funny thing to say. for the first thing he said.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{what? 'i'm keepin' m'damn lobster license'?}
<A>__{yeh. that.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{maybe he just said it. to make your uncle dennis laugh so hard. you think?}
<A>__{she keeps unpacking. her face quiet and serious. her thoughts her own.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{it's not fair, is it. that jack woke up. and petal didn't.}
<A>__{and since he's said her thought aloud. she tells him...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{well. the world's not fair. you said.}
<A>__{she's not looking up. but he knows she's listening.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{that's something the world is always teaching us. and sometimes, the learning comes later.}
<A>__{that gets through. both adults can see it.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{you taught me that.}
<A>__{eyes resolutely down, she nods. remembers.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you know. what we wait for? it's like the main stem of this boat. it gives us our shape.}
<A>__{her brow furrows. doesn't understand that.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{see, i know why you saved a place for petal. all this time.}
<A>__{on this. she looks up. her dad is smiling from his eyes.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{cos i'm the daddy. and you learn how to do. by watching me.}
<A>__{and...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you just watched. better than i knew.}
<A>__{still holding bunny's eyes. he beckons to the woman rowing. c'mere, a second. so wavey sets down her oars. slides over. and quoyle whispers to his daughter...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{watch this.}
<A>__{he leans his face. to wavey's mouth. a kiss so tender, even a child can't turn away. the moment lingers. and when it ends...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{i'm thanking your daddy. for all my presents.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{there was only two.}
<A>__{wavey looks at this girl.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{more than two. everything i need. except...}
<A>__{except. she gathers all the courage it takes to say...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{except a necklace.}
<A>__{and waits. we can feel her heart pounding in her throat. bunny stares back with eyes no one could read. and then...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{i got a box of 'em. you could pick one.}
<A>__{a hush over this bay. a woman stunned and grateful.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{then you'd have everything you need.}
<A>__{well, that seems true. so, the woman nods. her eyes flutter down. in the silence, she unwraps a sandwich...}
<C>__{wavey }
<D>__{you want the cheese?}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{okay, then. she hands that one to quoyle. and as she and bunny look for another, we pull... ...up and away, an aerial angle swirling above the shimmering bay. the boat so far below us. the people tiny specks. they could be anyone. anyone at all.}
