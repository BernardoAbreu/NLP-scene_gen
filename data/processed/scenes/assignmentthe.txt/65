<A>__{amos, jack and ramirez walk amongst the tombstones. jack and amos have warm coats. ramirez does not. he shivers in the cold, but tries not to show his discomfort.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{this is going to be unlike any learning experience you've ever had before. for one thing, we're going to push to all your limits. fatigue, frustration and fear. we're going to make you more terrified than you've ever been in your life just to see how you handle the fear. any other learning experience you get things ninety nine point nine nine nine percent right you get an "a." here if you get things ninety nine point nine nine nine percent right... you get...}
<A>__{jack walks right up to ramirez and mimes a gun with his thumb and index finger and puts it right up to ramirez's temple and goes...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{dead! and i will tell you the truth. i honestly in my heart of hearts don't care whether you live or die. don't take that personal. i don't care whether i live or die. i do care about getting carlos. that's all i care about.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{but nothing personal, right?}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{i'm not as cold blooded as my american friend... it would bother me very much if you were dead... so we will teach you to stay alive... but no questions... just do. otherwise...}
<A>__{he puts the imaginary gun to ramirez's temple.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{when do we start?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you already have. what were the names on the last three tombstones you passed on your right?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i... i don't know, i wasn't looking. i wasn't paying attention.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that's what will get you killed. carlos is always looking... always paying attention. always.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{because carlos is the master of the techniques of survival which we will teach you and because he is an efficient killer for whoever employs him, then for him there are simply no rules. unlike you miguel, you're a rule follower, aren't you?}
<A>__{ramirez says nothing.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{carlos is the opposite of that and that's what's so seductive, you know? he can kill whomever he chooses... ravish whoever he chooses... take whatever he chooses. do... whatever he chooses. it is to be in many ways a superman, not bound by the mores or morals of humanity.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and if you learn what we can teach you, you'll be one, too. if not, you'll be dead.}
