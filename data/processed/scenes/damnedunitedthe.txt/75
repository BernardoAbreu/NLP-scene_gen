<L>__{exterior touchline day (1972)}
<A>__{clough sits in his dug out. while jimmy gordon and taylor are calling out instructions to the derby players on the pitch... clough stares at revie and his lieutenants in their neighbouring dug out. presently...clough's view, and our frame is filled by two wheel chairs carrying disabled learning difficulties fans wearing rosettes... the wheel chair fan looks at clough for a beat, then violently shakes a rattle...}
<D>__{wheel chair fan come on leeds!!!!!}
<A>__{clough's face: shocked. then, all of a sudden.... "rrrrroooooooaaaaaarrrrrr", a roar goes up. goal leeds. revie and his henchmen leap to their feet, delighted. applauding. the wheel chair fan screams with delight. makes a `wanker' gesture in clough's face. clough's face: darkening like thunder.}
