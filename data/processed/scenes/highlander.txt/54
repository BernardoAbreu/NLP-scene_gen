<C>__{conor}
<D>__{why does he want to kill me?}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{you recall how i spoke of the push you feel and how i make it less?}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{aye.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{it is always less with my living. far or near. but if i were to die the push would become stronger than ever before. there is power in this. and as long as you and i live, the knight can never have it all.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{but we cannot be killed.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{there is an imperfection. for all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. you can survive anything but steel against your threat. then it is over. the end.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{how can i stop such a man?}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{hide. run to the ends of the earth till you learn. you must learn to defend yourself. in this i can help.}
