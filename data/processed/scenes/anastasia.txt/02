<L>__{interior palace at st. petersberg night}
<A>__{elegant royalists mingle around the main hall as an orchestra plays. all eyes turn to the glass doors of two elevadors which descend grandly on either side of a beautiful staircase. through the glass doors we see tatiana, the dowager empress, 60, imperious and bedecked with jewels, she is seemingly unapproachable. tsar nicholas and his son are with her. in the other elevador, alexandra and her daughters well, all her daughters except. . . anastasia, eight years old and apparently late for the party, rushes down the upstairs hallway followed by a servent (sonya) 16, who is trying to catch up with anastasia to tie a large ribbon in her long, dark hair.}

<D>__{princess anastasia you're late and it's all my fault!}
<C>__{anastasia}
<D>__{don't worry, sonya, no one'll notice. . .}
<A>__{just then, sonya lassoes the ribbon around her hair, stopping anastasia with a}

<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{. . . owwwwwwwww!}
<A>__{all eyes turn to anastasia, who once she realizes that she's the center of attention, flashes a mischievous smile and descends the staircase in grand style. as the ribbon falls out of her hair and down her back, anastasia kicks it to sonya without breaking stride. tatiana sees her and can't help but smile. the music suddenly becomes a flourish of trumpets. servents open the elevador doors as the royal family steps out and begins a procession through their subjects. tatiana holds out her arm to anastasia as she makes it to tatiana's side just in time. anastasia has a beautiful but slightly impish face, dominated by large, blue, mischievous eyes. she an abundance of energy and confidence for a girl her age. "the rulars of russia" (opening number) the elegant guests sing their admiration as the beautiful and happy romanov family makes it's entrance into the ball, they're "the pride of all russia". vladimir invites sophie to dance and the entire glittering assembly assembly swings into a glorious sweeping waltz. singing their certainty that the romanovs will rule forever. during the above, the ball is in full swing. beautiful couples swirls across the dance floor, including anastasia dancing gracefully with her father. under a long buffet table, we see dmitri, 11, darkly handsome, dressed in ragged servant clothes, with a shock of dark hair which continually falls across his eyes as watches the guest enviously. anastasia, still waltzing with her father, sees him. servents cross the room carrying a trays of beautiful tropical fruit. the guests "ew" and "ah" at the sumptuous fruit. anastasia sees dmitri eyeing it hungrily and without missing a dance step, she grabs an orange off the tray and tosses it to dmitri. he catches it and smiles broadly at her. suddenly, a hand grabs dmitri and pulls him out from under the table. it's ivar, the head servent, who pulls dmitri into an open wall panel.}

<D>__{someday my place will be out there!}
<C>__{ivar}
<D>__{never! you're a peasant, dmitri! back in the kitchen}
<A>__{rulars of russia (cont.) underscore continues as dmitri is dragged from his hiding place under the table and back to the kitchen. it's like the moscow circus back there, comic musical confusion. the servants sing about their demanding employers and mockingly imitate their behavior: they imply that they have their own "party", that change is coming. while back in the ballroom, the royalists are oblivious to the servants discontent and sing their satisfaction with their own lives. dramatic underscore continues though the following scenes.}
<B>__{on tatiana}
<A>__{in a large throne like chair. tatiana is very serious and very regal. she slides over to make room for anastasia who sits next to her.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{why were you so late tonight}
<C>__{anastasia}
<D>__{i was showing sonya something . . .}

<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{it's where i've made my home but i do have something for you . . .}
<A>__{tatiana reaches from behind the chair and brings out a beautiful music box. tatiana takes the key, a small silver and enamel flower, on a silver neck chain and winds it up. music begins, she hands anastasia the key.}
<B>__{close up}
<A>__{the key bearing the inscription "together in paris".}

<A>__{the lights begin to fade in and out.}
<B>__{group shot}
<A>__{as people in the ballroom look around bewildered. then, a whirlwind kicks up, sending everyone off the dance floor, as the whirlwind becomes a tornado. suddenly, an albino bat (bartok) with huge eyes, springs out of the funnel, screeching and swooping over the crowd, causing everyone to duck and cover their heads in fear. the tornada reaches it's peak and explodes in smoke leaving rasputin standing alone in the middle of the floor. he is of indeterminate age, towering over other men in the room, his most striking feature are his eyes which at this moment are burning a fiery red. he is dressed in a flowing black monk's robe with a satin rope tied around his waist. connected to the rope is a glowing reliquary, a mystical lantern.}
