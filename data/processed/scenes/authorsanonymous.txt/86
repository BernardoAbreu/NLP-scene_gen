<C>__{william}
<D>__{fine. i was going to quit anyway. leave this bunch of losers.}
<A>__{william makes eye contact with colette: you too? she looks away: sorry. only fuels william more. he points to alan.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{christ. you and your stupid recorder. and your stupid ideas. and your stupid character names.}
<A>__{william clenches his fist and pretends it's a microphone.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{name for character. bobby blow me. gimme a break.}
<A>__{alan sits stone faced. william turns to john.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{and g.i. joe over here with that piece of crap, self published tripe. who are you kidding?}
<A>__{flustered, john starts to stand up. alan grabs john's arm, pulls him back down.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{just ignore him.}
<A>__{william continues on his rant with colette.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{colette, colette, my pet. news flash for you: oprah's not calling unless she needs a massage. get real!}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oprah? she's not on tv anymore.}

<D>__{i know that.}
<A>__{william turns his attention to henry.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{the great henry o. man, you got the gift, bro'. but your head is up your ass over poor, sweet, successful hannah here.}
<A>__{hannah and henry avoid looking at each other as william smiles at hannah.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{hannah. hannah. hannah. we could have been so hot together. i'm just as good a writer as you are, but you sure look better in a skirt }
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(voice rising)}
<D>__{that's enough.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i don't need any of you. i don't need any of your pointless, pedestrian feedback. i'm a writer.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you've got goddamn three pages.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{they're a great three pages! you just don't appreciate my dedication.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{you're a pretend writer, william.}
<A>__{silence. william is surprised that hannah speaks out.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{she's right. you act the part. you like the lifestyle. you hit on women. you quote bukowski. but bukowski did the work. each and every day he wrote. that's your problem, william. you don't do the work.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i don't do the work? man, that sounds frickin' hilarious coming from you. when's the last time you wrote anything?}
<A>__{that hits a nerve. william and henry stare each other down. enough. william flips off the group with his middle finger. mumbling, grumbling under his breath, he starts to leave. pauses at the writers at work sign. picks it up.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{not the sign!}
<A>__{too late. william rips it in two. and a second time for good measure. throwing the pieces on the ground. stomps out of the house, slamming the front door. the group turns quiet for a long beat. everyone calming down. alan takes control again eyes still darting over to what's left of his beloved sign.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{let's move on. next item. richard benedict is going to be doing a signing at wordsmith next week.}
<A>__{alan looks directly at henry.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{who wants to go?}
