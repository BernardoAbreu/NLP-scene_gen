<A>__{...and percy hauls the last of the stuff out, exhausted. he steps back in and looks around, unable to believe there's no mouse cowering in the corner. paul and the men approach, keeping straight faces, navigating the crap in the corridor.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{gosh. ain't in there, huh? don't that beat the mousie band?}
<A>__{percy keeps scanning the restraint room. the others all look to paul, waiting for him to speak you're the boss.}
