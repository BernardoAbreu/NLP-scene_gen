<A>__{the study door is just closing, indy closing it behind him... just as herman comes through the front door, still playing the trumpet. indy reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from herman's mouth. herman continues to spitright into indy's face. indy flinches.}
<C>__{herman}

<D>__{well, yes, sir. it's right here!}
<A>__{indy shows the cross, more or less handing it to the sheriff to make his pointerior the sheriff takes it casually.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{i'm glad to see that... because the rightful owner of this cross won't press charges, if you give it back.}
<A>__{fedora enters the house, followed by roscoe, rough rider and halfbreed. he politely removes his hat and holds it in his hand. he nods at indy in a friendly manner.}
