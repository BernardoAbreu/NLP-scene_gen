<L>__{interior parliament day}
<A>__{lords and royals sit in this august hall, waiting for the session to begin. coward looks up, and points, very emphatically.}
<C>__{lord coward}
<D>__{look.}
<A>__{all eyes rise to see: blackwood, up in the lords' gallery. the hall goes silent, staring at a ghost. blackwood is calm, commanding. voices rise; blackwood's followers move to block the doors as bong! the first chime of noon from big ben.}
<L>__{114 interior sewers day}
<A>__{the chime echoes. dredger charges towards the device and irene. holmes flies into him feet first, deflecting him for a moment. it is now clear that dredger's sole purpose is to protect the device. irene sits at the device, trying to figure out how to defuse it. bong! the second chime resounds. dredger grabs holmes, thrusts him upwards against the sewer roof, simultaneously strangling him and hammering him against the bricks hard enough to dislodge some. holmes lashes out with his feet at dredger who doesn't even bother to block anything. holmes' kicks lose steam as he loses air. bong!}
<C>__{irene}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{nine strokes left.}
<A>__{dredger grins until he is earholed from behind by two bricks, swung with full force by watson. dredger drops holmes, staggers back holding his bleeding ears. holmes heads back to irene. watson draws the sword from his sword stick. deadly enough, but not very big.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you owe me for the ring.}
<A>__{dredger backs off, as if scared of the sword but only until he can reach up and pull blackwood's ceremonial sword down off a brick ledge. this is going to be more uneven than usual. bong! as watson parries dredger's massive slashes and thrusts all around them, only just keeping dredger at bay holmes sees that the cylinder is welded onto the cradle by two rods. his eyes narrow, a plan forming.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{give me your gun. the bullets, i need the bullets.}
<A>__{bong! the clock is ticking down. irene pops open her derringer, slides the bullets into holmes' hand. he chops open the bullet casings with his knife, pouring the gunpowder into the bowl of his pipe. bong! watson ducks a whooshing cut, lunges with his little sword, sticks it into the meat of dredger's bicep. dredger grunts angrily, flexes his bicep, rips the sword out of watson's grasp with his muscle, then he pulls it out, snaps the blade against the wall like a twig, and moves in to cut watson in two with the ceremonial sword from head to toe. watson dives desperately, gets a haircut from the sword which shatters against the floor. while watson is down, dredger punts him into the sewer with a splash, then turns back to the device. bong!}
