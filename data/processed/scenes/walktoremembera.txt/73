<L>__{exterior cemetery rear gate night}
<A>__{jamie quickly scales the fence. landon's right after her.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{why are we here?}
<L>__{interior cemetery}
<A>__{jamie drops down. takes a flashlight from her bag.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(on top of gate)}
<D>__{the world of the dead?}
<C>__{jamie}
<P>__{(being mysterious)}
<D>__{could be...}
<A>__{he drops down, not sure what she means. she's already walking away. he follows.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{my mother's buried near here.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{my father's alive but it's like he's dead.}
<A>__{she looks at landon, feeling his sorrow, then unlocks a storage shed. opens the door. enters. returns a moment later carrying several pieces of an odd looking home made cylindrical device.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{jamie}
<P>__{(proud)}
<D>__{that is my telescope.}
<A>__{same scene minutes later the ten inch dobsonian telescope is pointed at the sky. the eye piece is at the end of the long scope; the scope rests on a plywood base. landon looks through the eye piece. pov (through telescope) close on golden planet a beautiful view of a golden planet with a broad, flat ring system.}
<B>__{widen.}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{saturn. beautiful.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{before voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings }
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{but there are thousands of them, made of floating ice }
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{or building blocks for a world that never formed.}
<A>__{she looks at him. he smiles, embarrassed.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{i'm not smart. just a sponge.}
<A>__{she smiles, disagreeing, then looks through the telescope and changes its view.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{sometimes i come here and just scan the heavens.}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(joking)}
<D>__{looking for intelligent life?}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{looking for something someone.}
<A>__{pause. he doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{do you believe you'll see your mother again?}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{i hope so.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think maybe she sees me now.}
<A>__{their eyes meet. she looks away. changes the subject.}
<C>__{jamie}
<P>__{(re: telescope)}
<D>__{i'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of haley's comet }
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{the dirty snowball at its core.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{in 76 years, me neither.}
<A>__{she likes that he knows a little about astronomy. they each lean back on a tombstone and stare at the stars.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{you're really into god, right?}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{in ten words or less?}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{my relationship with god is my own.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{but you think about him it her.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{don't you?}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{not really.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{when you do, how do you?}
<A>__{landon could joke or he could reveal something.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{like in a church painting. i see this giant hovering over the ground. he's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{i know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes i don't understand what the message is or what the point is.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{there is no pointerior you live. you die. the end.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{maybe we're not supposed to understand, but we're supposed to have faith that someone else sees the big picture.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{you have to believe to have faith.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{you don't believe in anything?}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{the bible. why should i read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{interpreted by another guy like my father.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{your father doesn't like me.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{he doesn't trust you.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{sometimes i don't even trust me.}
<A>__{he sits up and pulls rainmaker scripts from his back pocket. he holds one out to her. a moment passes. she takes it.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{i'm not afraid of you.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{likewise.}
