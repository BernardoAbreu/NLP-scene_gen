<L>__{exterior smilin' jack's fish camp night}
<A>__{suzie wanders along the canal, smoking a jointerior at her back a few faint lights flicker here and there in the windows of trailers. she walks down to the little dock, sits on a rail, takes another hit.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{'evening, suzie. how was school today?}
<A>__{suzie freezes, holds back her exhale, looking around... a shadow stirs in one of the skiffs tied to the dock. a man stands, walks up the couple of wooden stairs. the light from a trailer across the road glances off steel rimmed glasses as ray duquette steps onto the dock. suzie gags on the smoke in her lungs, coughs. she squeezes the lit roach into her palm, then tosses it into the canal.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you ought to watch it with that shit, suzie. you get busted again, you go back in a two tine loser.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{you got something against cigarettes?}
<A>__{ray just laughs at her.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah, they're bad for your health.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm tryin' to look out for you...}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{that's cop bullshit.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{well, you're half right. best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{every triangle i've ever seen never lasts. somebody's got to go.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{is this supposed to mean something to me? what triangle?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you, kelly, sam.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{i don't have to listen to this. and you can't shove me around. i have friends now...}
<A>__{she catches herself, falters. ray laughs once more.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{is that what you think? you have friends? is that what they told you?}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{i don't mean who you're thinking. i have other friends...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{suzie, suzie... this is me, ray, you're talking to. we both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...}
<A>__{he takes a sheet of paper from his coat.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{here, suzie. i want you :o look this over. know what it is?}
<P>__{(as suzie takes it)}
<D>__{sam deposited his check, transferred the funds to an offshore bank, a numbered account. not even the cops can find out whose names are on it. think one of them's yours?}
<A>__{suzie looks over the paper.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{he also put a down on some island property, and a lease to buy on a forty foot sailboat. you're into sailing, aren't you, suzie?}
<A>__{suzie thrusts the paper back at ray.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{get away from me.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{don't you see what this means? you really think sam and kelly are gonna give you a third of the money? you, the pill head with the rap sheet?}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{ray smiles at her. he moves up close.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you know, i don't think i ever told you i was sorry about your little friend... what was his name?}
<A>__{suzie tries to back away. she bumps against the rail. ray reaches out, takes her hand in both of his.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{come on, suzie, help me out here. you know his name.}
<A>__{suzie looks scared, in a way she hasn't before. when she speaks her voice is scarcely above a whisper.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{davy.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(nodding, a scary smile)}
<D>__{that's right. that was his name.}
<A>__{the smile fades, as if he's thinking about something, still holding her hand, rubbing it with his fingers.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{sometimes i wonder if you're really as dumb as you pretend to be.}
<A>__{he looks into suzie's eyes, slowly opening her hand to reveal the burn mark on her palm.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{but you know what? i'd be keeping a clear mind right now if i were you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'd hate to see you come to a bad end. like davy did.}
<A>__{he holds her hand a moment longer, then drops it. he goes back down he steps to the little skiff. an outboard motor starts in the night.}
