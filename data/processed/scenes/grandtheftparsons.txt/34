<L>__{exterior suburban street. day}
<A>__{a suburban street of small, neat bungalows. we move down the street, past house and identical house, until we rest outside another that is identical to the rest. the front door opens, and a nondescript man emerges, carrying a small overnight bag. he carefully locks the door and walks down the path to where a cab waits. we can clearly see 'new orleans taxi' marked on the door.}
