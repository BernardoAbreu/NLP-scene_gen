<A>__{he hurries up to his apartment building and lets himself in.}
<L>__{interior trevor's apt. night}
<A>__{he looks out on the street. the figure is walking up the building opposite his. it's features are shrouded in shadow, but it is definitely staring at trevor, who slams the apartment door behind him. he peers out at the street from inside the front hall. the figure is gone. trevors looks around the apartment. he opens the fridge, it lights up the darkened room. he grabs one of the three items sitting on the wire racks. about to twist off the cap off a cold beer, when a light out his window urges him to investigate. he draws the curtain open and gasps. pov out window: staring back at him, from a dimly lit window in the apartment building across the street, is the shadowy man that followed trevor home. the man's face is shrouded in shadows but trevor can see he's holding something bundled up in a blanket. the light in the window winks out, rendering it dark again. trevor can almost still see the figure somewhere in the darkness still gazing at him. trevor looks a little sick all of a sudden, like he can't breathe. the bell from a distant cathedral begins to peel. bong...}
<B>__{bong... bong...}
<A>__{trevor opens his mouth to draw in a breath but instead spits out a massive amount of water!}
<B>__{bong... bong... bong...}
<A>__{trevor falls to the ground, arms and legs thrashing, heaving up mouthfuls of water. trevor is drowning...}
<B>__{bong... bong... bong...}
<A>__{in the puddles of water, we see bits of debris: leaves, pebbles, etc. finally, a hideous eel like creature's head pokes out of trevor's gaping mouth it escapes and slithers across the floor, up the window sill and out into the night. the ringing bell stops abruptly and he takes in a humongous lungful of sweet oxygen. he then notices he is completely dry. stunned, he looks about him. trevor is now laying on the easychair, nursing a beer. his videogame is flashing play again? whoa. the bing bong! of his doorbell startles him. trevor gets the door to find a striking young gothic woman on the other side. black hair, lipstick, fingernails. she smiles (too brightly for someone with such somber appointments) then summarily lifts her shirt to just below her breasts for trevor.}
<C>__{gothic woman}
<D>__{here it is, what do you think?}
<A>__{trevor looks down at her stomach, the lower half of which contains tattoos which just break the surface of her jeans. at its center is a navel pierced with a studded black pearl, which gothic woman then plays with. trevor looks a little confused.}
<C>__{gothic woman }
<D>__{i saw it on the counter, looked at the name and the rest is history. it's like, named after me. well...?}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(getting uncomfortable)}
<D>__{oh. uh... it's beautiful. i'm sorry, i've just been having a weird day...}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{i totally understand. listen i don't know if you're into incense but, i bought some, it's called witching hour. to inhale it is to love it. i mean the stuff'll clear your head big time. come on over, i will burn some for you. if you can't sleep tonight...}
<A>__{she jabs a thumb down the hall behind her.}
<C>__{tawny }
<D>__{... knock on my door, i'm a total insomniac.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{no, thanks i've got a... a date tonight }
<A>__{his eyes roaming her, he finally finds a tattoo on her shoulder reading:}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{ tawny.}
<C>__{tawny}
<P>__{(eyebrows raised)}
<D>__{whew. you bounce right back don't you?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{didn't your like... whole life get totalled last week?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{last week...}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{the car accident? any of this ringing a bell?}
<A>__{trevor eyes her nervously then:}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{it's not that kind of date.}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{hey even if it is more power to ya.}
<P>__{(awkwardly)}
<D>__{alrighty then. have a good time.}
<A>__{tawny ambles off to her apartment. trevor closes the door and leans against it. he slides down the door and covers his face with his hands. another headache coming on.}
