<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{yeah. he did.}
<C>__{ben}

<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{okay. okay. that's enough of that shit.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's not shit, paul. my point is, when you're a child, you think anything is possible. wouldn't it be great to think like that now?}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(retreating back into his cynicism)}
<D>__{yeah, just sprinkle some fuckin' fairy dust on me.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm just saying you've got to keep an open mind and explore some new possibilities. try some different things maybe you'll connect with one of them. there's a career counselor i work with. i can call him for you. he may be able to help you find a job.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{you mean working for somebody? i'm supposed to take orders from some guy who used to get me coffee?}
<P>__{(starts sweating and breathing hard)}
<D>__{i can't do that. it's not right. it's not me.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how do you know unless you try?}
<A>__{suddenly one of the windows behind vitti shatters. ben dives for cover. silence then another rap on the window. ben looks out and sees jelly in the back yard, tossing stones at the window.}
<C>__{jelly}
<P>__{(calls out)}
