<L>__{interior railroad car day}
<A>__{favoring helmut as he rolls over and jumps up, waggling his head from side to side in the manner of a jack in the box. the children watch him big eyed. a few giggle.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{look, i'm a jack in the box.}
<A>__{he gestures around to indicate that he is, indeed, in a box.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{we're all jacks in the box the same box.}
<A>__{the children laugh, and some begin imitating helmut's head movements. others do the same, and still others, including the czech youngsters, until all are waggling their heads at each other and loving it. then, out of sheer adoration, the youngest of the children close in on helmut and hug him around his legs. slowly he stops waggling his head and stretches out his arms to embrace as many of them as he can almost as if trying to protect them. suddenly the gaiety dissolves, and the children go solemnly silent. helmut reacts.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{well... who's hungry.}
<A>__{almost in unison, the children shout "i am", again forgetting their unhappiness.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{all right, i want everybody to sit down. when i count three, everybody sit. ready? one, two...}
<A>__{on the count of two, many of the youngsters sit down. helmut feigns surprise.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{oh, you're too fast. three!}
<A>__{this brings a burst of giggles, and the remaining children, sit down... the czechs following the example of the others. helmut opens the burlap sack and begins handing out pieces of black bread. the children grab at the chunks and gnaw it voraciously. when all of the youngsters have been given the bread, helmut takes a piece and bites into it with great relish. after a few chews on the bread:}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{now... what'll we do?}
<A>__{there is a long moment of silence, then the little blonde girl with the rag doll speaks up timidly.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{i want to see my mommy.}
<A>__{helmut is brought up short. for a beat he searches his brain frantically for an answer. then he goes to the child and kneels beside her.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{you would? all right.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{you know where she is?}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{she's right here with you.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{i don't see her.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{that's because you don't know how to look. i will show you. close your eyes.}
<P>__{(to the other children)}
<D>__{all of you... close your eyes.}
<A>__{the little girl closes her eyes and one by one the other youngsters do also. the czech children look at each other, then at the other children, then they too close their eyes.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{everybody's eyes shut? now, think about your mommys and daddys... there, don't you see them? can't you see their faces?}
<A>__{the children, marvelling at this feat, ad lib expressions of assent.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{so you see! they're right here with you. all you have to do is look in your hearts.}
<C>__{little girl}
<P>__{(putting her hand over her heart)}
<D>__{does mommy see me, doork?}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(deeply touched)}
<D>__{yes, she does. she has you safe in her heart, too.}
<A>__{the silence in the car tells helmut that sadness has returned to the children. he brightens quickly and rises.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i've got an idea. you all know my name, but i don't know yours. so let's find out everybody's name, shall we?}
<A>__{he points to a boy of about ten in the group.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{you... come here and i will show you what we'll do.}
<A>__{the boy, honored at being singled out, rises and comes to helmut, who takes a stubby pencil from his pocket.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(timidly)}
<D>__{willie.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{willie. that's a good name. how do you spell it?}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{w i l l i e.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{fine. i will just write that on top of your head.}
<A>__{using the eraser end of the pencil, helmut carefully traces the letters on top of the boy's head. the youngster peers upward, wondering.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{there. see, this way we'll all be able to tell everybody else's name just by looking at his head.}
<A>__{close shot boy still looking up, but now doubtful.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{did you really?}
<A>__{med. shot the group}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{of course i did. here...}
<A>__{he pulls an older boy to his feet, winks at him and points to the first boy's head.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(to the older boy)}
<D>__{tell him what it says.}
<C>__{older boy}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{it says willie.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{really? truly?}
<A>__{he puts his hand to his head.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{be careful. don't smear it.}
<P>__{(he glances around)}
<D>__{let's see now... yes. you shall be nexterior}
<A>__{he points to a czech girl of about six. he motions for her to come over to him. she shyly bows her head. her friends push her forward. helmut holds out his hand to her, she grabs it.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{what is your name?}
<A>__{she looks at him, then at the other czech children. they all giggle.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(squatting down beside her)}
<D>__{forgive me. i don't speak your language.}
<A>__{he gently plants a kiss on her cheek and she puts an arm around his neck.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{see! we understand each other. now...}
<P>__{(he points to willie)}
<D>__{willie.}
<P>__{(he points to himself)}
<D>__{doork.}
<P>__{(points again to willie)}
<D>__{willie.}
<P>__{(pointing to himself)}
<D>__{doork.}
<A>__{the child's eyes light up and she whispers into helmut's ear.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{a beautiful name! now you tell all the children.}
<C>__{czech girl}
<P>__{(almost a whisper)}
<D>__{inga.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{it's such a pretty name... say it again.}
<C>__{czech girl}
<P>__{(more sure of herself)}
<D>__{inga!}
<A>__{she quickly bows her head for helmut to outline her name on the top of it.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(with a flourish of his pencil)}
<D>__{i n g a. there it is.}
<A>__{the little girl gives a quick curtsy and hurries back to her group. helmut glances around at the children.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{let's see now. who wants to be nexterior}
<A>__{the little girl with the doll presses forward.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{you?}
<A>__{shaking her head she holds up the doll.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{her?}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{so the little children will know her name.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{of course. that way she can't get lost, can she? what's her name?}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{frederika.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(mock dismay)}
<D>__{frederika?}
<A>__{he studies the top of doll's tiny head. then he holds up his hand and measures off a distance of about three inches in the air with thumb and forefinger.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{frederika!}
<A>__{next he puts the doll's head between his thumb and forefinger, illustrating that the head is too small for the name.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{couldn't we just make it freda?}
<C>__{little girl}
<P>__{(solemnly)}
<D>__{oh, no! frederika.}
<A>__{helmut shrugs, closes one eye and begins writing in tiny letters on the doll's head. the children laugh delightedly.}
