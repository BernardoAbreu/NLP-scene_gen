<L>__{interior roth's suite med. view day}
<A>__{michael stands at roth's door carrying the briefcase that fredo had brought. a hotel doctor takes hyman roth's blood pressure, while his wife waits nervously.}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(spanish)}
<D>__{you must not exert yourself; i will write out a prescription and come back tomorrow.}
<C>__{hotel man}
<D>__{he's going to write a prescription.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{i want my own doctor; fly him in from miami. i don't trust a doctor who can't speak english.}
<A>__{the doctor is shown out. roth gestures to the hotel man, who also leaves. then he looks to his wife.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{honey, go down to the casino?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{if you feel better...}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{i do. play the bingo game.}
<A>__{they kiss, and she leaves. also bussetta and ola remain.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{my sixth sense tells me you have a bag full of money in your hand.}
<A>__{ola locks the door; michael nods, and opens the bag, spilling its contents on the card table.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{this doubles my investment.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{still no word of your courier? we'll find him. but at least this will satisfy our friends here. you've been invited to the new year reception at the presidential home. i understand your brother is here as well; i hope he'll come.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.}
<A>__{roth looks patiently at michael, as though he were a child who hadn't minded the lesson that he had been taught over and over again.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{you're a careful kid, and that's good. but look. an international dispatch on the wire service. american journalism, not propaganda. the government troops have all but eliminated the rebels. all but their radio station.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i've read it; i'm pleased that the government is doing so well. as a heavy investor, i'm pleased. how did the doctor find you?}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{terrible. i'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{who had frankie pantangeli killed?}
<C>__{roth}
<P>__{(taken a bit off balance)}
<D>__{why...the rosato brothers.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i know that; but who gave the go ahead.}
<A>__{roth glances to ola; he is not a fool; he realizes michael has begun to suspect him.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{there was this kid that i grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know. we did our first work together, worked our way out of the street. things were good and we made the most of it. during prohibition, we ran molasses up to canada and made a fortune; your father too. i guess as much as anyone, i loved him and trusted him. later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop over for g.i.'s on the way to the west coast. that kid's name was moe greene, and the city he invented was las vegas. this was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town. someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order. when i heard about it i wasn't angry. i knew moe; i knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things. so when he turned up dead, i let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. i never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.}
<A>__{he regards michael silently a moment.}
<C>__{roth}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{there's three million dollars on that table. i'm going to lie down, maybe take a nap. when i wake up, if it's still there, i will know i have a partner. if it's gone, then i will know i don't.}
<A>__{the old man turns, and moves in his slippers, toward his bedroom.}
