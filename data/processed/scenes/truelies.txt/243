<L>__{interior building night}
<A>__{a filthy, crumbling cinderblock building (near the warehouse). a few bare light bulbs with bugs zipping around then, and no glass in the windows. harry and helen are brought in by two terrorist guards. juno follows then into the bleak room. guards shackle them to steel chairs with handcuffs. a man enters the room carrying a small suitcase. he has skull like features. he opens the suitcase and harry has a good view of the contents: medical instruments, needle probes, drills, dremel tools with saw blades.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{this is samir. see if you can guess his specialty.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oral hygiene?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{not exactly.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{what's going on, harry?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{samir is just going to ask harry a few questions. see, we're not even sure which agency harry works for. now, samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years. so it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.}
<C>__{samir}
<P>__{(holding up a syringe)}
<D>__{this will help.}
<A>__{samir injects harry in the arm with the syringe.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know, you should swab that with alcohol. i might get an infection.}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{i will return when this has taken effect. then we'll talk.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm looking forward to it.}
<A>__{samir exits.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{why are you helping these raving psychotics.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{because they're very well funded raving psychotics, and i'm getting a lot of money.}
<A>__{she kneels down in front of harry, stroking his leg.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{you think i care about their cause? or yours? not at all. see, america is on top now . . . but so was rome, once. all civilizations crumble. one nation succeeding over another. what does it mean in the long run? the only important thing is to live well. and... living well takes money.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you're damaged goods, lady.}
<A>__{harry's words are beginning to be slightly slurred. the drugs are taking effect.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(indicating helen)}
<D>__{did you tell her about us, harry?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{there is no us, you psychotic bitch.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{sure. say that now.}
<A>__{juno puts her arms around him and kisses him passionately. she breaks, looking at helen to savor the effect. helen is trembling with rage.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{thanks for everything, harry. it was good while it lasted.}
<A>__{juno crosses to the guard and takes a hand grenade off his belt. then she goes to helen and places it between her knees. she pushes helen's knees together to hold the spoon against the grenade then pulls the pin.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{something you obviously have a hard time doing!}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{hold that thought.}
<A>__{juno leaves. harry looks dopily at helen.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{there was nothing. i swear.}
<A>__{helen doesn't believe him, and why should she. she looks up from staring at the grenade, to see that harry's head has slumped forward.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what did he give you?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(groggy)}
<D>__{sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it makes you tell the truth?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{is it working yet?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ask me a question i would normally lie to.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{are we going to die?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yup.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'd say it's working.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{they'll either torture us to death, shoot us in the head, or leave us until the bomb goes off.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{okay, okay. i get it. how long have you been a spy, harry?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{17 years.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{my god. have you had to... have sex with other women in the line of duty?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i don't take those assignments.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what about juno?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{she's really a fox, isn't she?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{did you pork her harry?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but i wanted to.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{are you a total lying, scumsucking pig harry?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{looks that way.}
