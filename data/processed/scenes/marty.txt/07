<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{pilletti home, kitchen. night marty and clara come into the dark house. nobody is home. marty and clara's silhouettes block the doorway momentarily.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{wait a minute. lemme find the light.}
<A>__{he finds the lights. the kitchen is suddenly brightly lit. the two of them stand squinting to adjust to the sudden glare.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i guess my mother ain't home yet. i figure my cousin thomas and virginia musta gone to the movies, so they won't get back till one o'clock at least.}
<A>__{clara advances into the kitchen, a little ill at ease, and looks around. marty closes the porch door.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{this is the kitchen.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{yes, i know.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{come on inna dining room.}
<A>__{he turns the light on as he enters. clara follows him into the...}
<B>__{dining room.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{siddown, take off your coat. you want something to eat? we gotta whole half chicken in the icebox.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(alighting tentatively}
<D>__{on the edge of a}
<P>__{chair)}
<D>__{no, thank you. i don't think i should stay very long.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{sure. just take off your coat a minute.}
<A>__{he helps her off with her coat. he remains behind her, looking down at her. conscious of his scrutiny, she sits uncomfortably, breathing unevenly. marty takes her coat into the dark living room. clara is patient but nervous. marty comes back, sits on another chair, and there is an awkward silence.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{so i was telling you, my kid brother nickie got married last sunday. that was a very nice affair. and they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. i never saw anything so grand in my life.}
<P>__{(the silence again falls between them.)}
<D>__{and watta meal. i'm a butcher, so i know a good hunka steak when i see one. that was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. a buck eighty a pound. of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. that gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. listen, clara, make yourself comfortable. you're all tense.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{oh, i'm fine.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{you want me to take you home, i will take you home.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{maybe that would be a good idea.}
<A>__{she stands. he stands. he's a little angry. he turns and sullenly goes back to the living room for her coat. wordlessly, he begins to help her into the coat. standing behind her, he puts his hands on her shoulders, then suddenly seizes her, and begins kissing her on the neck. as marty holds clara, kissing the back of her neck, the dialogue drops to quick, hushed whispers.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{no, marty, please...}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i like you. i like you. i been telling you all night, i like you...}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{marty...}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i just wanna kiss, that's all.}
<A>__{he attempts to turn her face toward him. she resists.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{please...}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{please...}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{marty...}
<A>__{he releases her and turns away violently.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{all right! i will take you home! all right!}
<A>__{he marches a few paces away, deeply disturbed. he turns back to her.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{all i wanted was a lousy kiss! what do you think, i was gonna try something serious with my mother coming home any minute!? what am i, a leper or something?!}
<A>__{he turns and goes into the living room to hide the flush of hot tears threatening to fill his eyes. clara is also on the verge of tears.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(more to herself than to him)}
<D>__{i just didn't feel like it, that's all.}
<A>__{slowly, she moves to the archway leading to the living room. camera angles to include the living room where marty sits on the couch with his hands in his lap, staring straight ahead. the room is dark except for the slanted light coming from the dining room. clara goes to the couch and sits on the edge beside him. he doesn't look at her.}
<B>__{living room.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i'm old enough to know better. comes new year's eve, everybody starts arranging parties, i'm the guy they gotta dig up a date for. let me getta packa cigarettes, and i will take you home.}
<A>__{he starts to rise but instead sinks back onto the couch, looking straight ahead. clara looks at him, her face peculiarly soft and compassionate.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i'd like to see you again. very much. the reason i didn't let you kiss me was because i just didn't know how to handle the situation. you're the kindest man i ever met. the reason i tell you this is because i want to see you again very much. i know that when you take me home, i'm going to just lie on my bed and think about you. i want very much to see you again.}
<A>__{marty stares down at his hands.}
<C>__{marty}
<P>__{(without looking over at her)}
<D>__{waddaya doing tomorrow night?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i will call you up tomorrow morning. maybe, we'll go see a movie.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i'd like that very much.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{the reason i can't be definite about it now is my aunt catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and i may have to help out.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i will wait for your call.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{we better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{she stands.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i will just get a packa cigarettes.}
<A>__{he rises and goes into his bedroom. camera angles to include door to bedroom. marty opens his bureau drawer and extracts a pack of cigarettes. he comes back out and looks at clara for the first time. they start to walk to the dining room. in the archway, marty pauses and turns to her.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{waddaya doing new year's eve?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{they quietly slip into each other's arms and kiss. slowly their faces part, and marty's head sinks down upon her shoulder. he is crying, detectable from the slight shake of his shoulders. the girl presses her cheek against the back of his head. they stand. the sound of the kitchen door opening splits them out of their embrace. a moment later mrs. pilletti's voice is heard.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti's voice}
<P>__{(off screen)}
<D>__{hallo! hallo! marty?!}
<A>__{she comes into the dining room, stops at the sight of marty and clara.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<D>__{hello, marty, when you come home?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{we just got here about fifteen minutes ago. ma, i want you to meet miss clara snyder. she's graduate of new york university. she teaches chemistry in benjamin franklin high school.}
<A>__{this seems to impress mrs. pilletti.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<D>__{siddown, siddown. you want some chicken? we got some chicken in the ice box.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{no, mrs. pilletti. we were just going home. thank you very much anyway.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<D>__{well, siddown a minute. i just come inna house. i will take off my coat. siddown a minute.}
<A>__{mrs. pilletti pulls her coat off.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{how'd you come home, ma? thomas give you a ride?}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{oh, it's a sad business.}
<P>__{(turning to clara)}
<D>__{my sister, catherine, she don't get along with her daughter in law, so she's gonna come live with us.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{oh, she's coming, eh, ma?}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<D>__{oh, sure.}
<P>__{(to clara)}
<D>__{siddown, siddown. marty, tell her siddown.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{might as well siddown a minute, clara.}
<A>__{clara smiles and sits. mrs. pilletti likewise seats herself, holding her coat in her lap.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<P>__{(to marty)}
<D>__{did you offer the young lady some fruit?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i offered her, ma, she don't want nothing.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{no, thank you, really, mrs. pilletti.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<P>__{(to clara with a sigh)}
<D>__{it's a very sad business, i tell you. a woman, fifty six years old, all her life, she had her own home. now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter in law's couch. it's a curse to be a mother, i tell you. your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? what is a mother's life but her children? it is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<D>__{hobby! what can she do? she cooks and she cleans. you gotta have a house to clean. you gotta have children to cook for. these are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{you mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter in law. she also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.}
<A>__{mrs. pilletti darts a quick, sharp look at clara. then she looks back to her own hands, which are beginning to twist nervously.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<D>__{you don't think my sister catherine should live in her daughter in law's house?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{well, i don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, i don't think a mother in law should live with a young couple.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<D>__{where do you think a mother in law should go?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<D>__{well, maybe that's what they teach you in new york university. in real life, it don't work out that way. you wait till you are a mother.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{it's silly of me to argue about it. i don't know the people involved.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{ma, i'm gonna take her home now. it's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{it was very nice meeting you, mrs. pilletti. i hope i will see you again.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{marty and clara move toward the kitchen.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{all right, ma. i will be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{goodnight, mrs. pilletti.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<A>__{marty and clara go out through the kitchen. camera stays on mrs. pilletti, who stands expressionlessly by her chair, staring after them. she remains there rigid even after the kitchen door has opened and shut.}
<B>__{fordham road. night}
<A>__{the biggest intersection in the bronx is near the grand concourse at fordham road, which is the biggest boulevard. despite the hour, the sidewalks are crowded with people. the traffic is heavy with buses. we pick up angie walking up fordham road just about to the grand concourse. as he reaches the northeast corner of the intersection and stands, waiting for the light to change, he looks off screen. something captures his attention, and he calls out.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{hey!!}
<B>__{street outside a department store.}
<A>__{in front of alexander's department store, the street is crowded, and a bus queue waits for the downtown concourse bus. marty and clara are part of the queue.}
<C>__{angie}
<P>__{(starting toward marty and clara, shouting)}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{angie starts into the street without waiting for the lights to change. impatiently, he has to wait until traffic stops for the light.}
<C>__{angie}
<P>__{(shouting as he goes)}
<D>__{hey, marty! hey!}
<A>__{marty and clara still stand, seeming not to hear angie.}
<C>__{angie's voice}
<P>__{(off screen)}
<D>__{hey, marty! marty!}
<A>__{marty and clara turn and stare off screen. angie pushes his way through the crowd on the sidewalk and manages to join marty and clara.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{where you been, for pete sakes?! i been looking all over for you.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i looked for you, angie, before i cut out, but i couldn't find you.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{i been looking all over for you!}
<A>__{angie is absolutely unaware of, or simply refuses to acknowledge the presence of the girl. he has pushed himself in between marty and clara, and addresses himself entirely to marty.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{what happened, angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. listen, angie, i want you to meet clara...}
<P>__{(he tries to turn the}
<D>__{sullen angie toward}
<P>__{clara)}
<D>__{clara, this is my best friend, angie. i told you about him.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{how do you do?}
<A>__{angie acknowledges the introduction with a surly nod.}
<C>__{angie}
<P>__{(completely ignoring clara now)}
<D>__{waddaya gonna do now?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i'm gonna take clara home. it's close to one.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{you want me to ride down with you?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{it's early.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{it must be one o'clock.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{it's saturday night! there's still plenty a action around!}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{angie, by the time i get clara home, it's gonna be one, one thirty. by the time i get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. i gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.}
<A>__{angie stares with thick, sullen jealousy at his best friend. he turns sharply and starts away from marty and clara.}
<C>__{angie}
<P>__{(as he goes)}
<D>__{all right, i will see you!}
<C>__{marty}
<P>__{(calling after him)}
<D>__{where you going?}
<A>__{angie, feeling rejected and jealous, moves swiftly out into the other pedestrians on fordham road.}
<C>__{marty}
<P>__{(calling more loudly after him)}
<D>__{i will see you tomorrow after mass!}
<A>__{he stares for a moment at the departing form of his friend, then turns to clara with a shrug and a smile, as if to say, "i don't know what's the matter with him." the long awaited downtown bus roars up to the corner, blocking our view of marty and clara. lower middle class bronx street. night. marty and clara stroll along the walk toward the front doors of an apartment house.}
<B>__{apartment house lobby. night.}
<A>__{marty and clara enter and cross the lobby toward the stairway. they move slowly.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{you got an elevator in this house?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{we just live one flight up.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{so i will call you tomorrow.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{clara leans against the iron banister of the stairway.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{call me about two thirty, because i won't be home from my aunt's till about then.}
<A>__{the doors of the elevator slide open, and a middle aged couple comes out. they have obviously been having a heated exchange; but at the sight of marty and the girl at the stairway, they become silent. they march across the lobby and out to the street in repressed silence. the door clangs behind them. marty and clara have waited stiffly through this interruption, and now they look at each other and smile.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{okay, so i will see you tomorrow night then.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{marty turns and moves across the lobby toward the street door.}
<B>__{outside the apartment house.}
<A>__{marty stands a moment in the clear black night air, expressionless, but within him, a strange exhilaration is beginning to stir. he mosies away from the building along the sidewalk, camera panning with him. he strikes out suddenly with a spirited stride, as if he knew where he was going.}
