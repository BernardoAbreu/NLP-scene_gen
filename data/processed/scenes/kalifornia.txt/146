<L>__{exterior an isolated abandoned store next morning}
<A>__{the lincoln pulls up at the rear of the store. adele exits carrying a couple of bags of chinese take out food.}
<L>__{interior abandoned store}
<A>__{adele enters the decrepit store. the others are inside. brian and carrie are tied up. brian watches early intently as he takes one of the bags from adele. he begins opening one of the carry out containers.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{what the hell is this stuff?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{it's chinese food. it was the only place open. you said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...}
<A>__{early opens another container. stares curiously at the contents.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{yeah but, what is it?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i don't know, they didn't speak too good english.}
<A>__{early sets the container down.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{and just what exactly are the chinese doing here in the middle of the american desert anyway?... didja get the beer?}
<A>__{adele somewhat reluctantly hands early a bottle of beer from a second bag.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{..."chink" beer!}
<A>__{early notices that brian is watching him intently. he mistakes brian's interest for hunger.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{oh hell, i'm sorry bri. adele, honey, untie brian, he's starving over there.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{carrie, you want some?}
<A>__{carrie doesn't respond at all. adele unties brian. early pulls out his gun, puts it on the table next to him. brian sits across from early. he watches as early rummages impatiently through the carry out paraphernalia.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{where's the damn forks and spoons at!}
<A>__{frustrated, early finally takes a gulp of chinese food right out of the container. it goes down rough.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{...is it just me, or has this whole trip been goin' downhill ever since we ran outta lucky lager?}
<A>__{brian picks up a pair of chopsticks, then reconsiders, puts them back down and, like early, gulps from the container. nearby, carrie sits quietly. as she listens to the two men talk... she notices something on her arm. she lifts her arm up to get a closer look.}
<B>__{her pov}
<A>__{she sees that a few of the white down feathers still cling to her. closer... and she sees that one of the tiny feathers is tinged with blood. the gas station attendant's. it freaks her.}
<B>__{on brian and early}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{how many people have you killed early?}
<A>__{early stops... thinks for a moment.}
<B>__{on carrie}
<A>__{she tries to brush the bloodied feather away... but with her hands bound, she can't reach it.}
<B>__{on brian and early}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{well now, how many people d'you see me kill?}
<A>__{brian shakes his head.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{none.}
<B>__{on carrie}
<A>__{in quiet desperation, she raises her arm to her lips... and blows the solitary blood tinged reminder away.}
<B>__{on brian and early}
<A>__{early stares at brian.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{...well then, that's how many i killed.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(unconvincingly)}
<D>__{if you say so.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{damn right i do.}
<B>__{on adele}
<A>__{adele watches the tiny down feather drift to the floor.}
<B>__{on brian and early}
<A>__{early picks up a different container and gulps some down. after a moment...}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{you never killed anyone have you bri'?}
<A>__{brian shakes his head no.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{you never even seen anybody killed, right?}
<A>__{brian stops eating and looks at early.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{what are you getting at?}
<A>__{early leans closer to him.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{you wanna tell me how'n the hell you gonna write a book 'bout somethin' you don't know nothin' 'bout?}
<A>__{eye to eye, the two men stare at one another. brian has no answer.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{ya see what i'm sayin'?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ha!}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(nervously mimes the same)}
<D>__{...ha.}
<A>__{early goes back to gulping down his dinner. this time he gets a spicy one.}
<C>__{early}
<P>__{(a nod toward the carry out container)}
<D>__{...watch out for that stuff, it bites.}
<A>__{brian gazes at the cluster of chinese carry out food containers. an ironic reminder of an earlier conversation. he lets out a weak ironic laugh.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(recollecting to himself)}
<D>__{...way too much msg.}
