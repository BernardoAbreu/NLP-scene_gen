<L>__{interior room night}
<A>__{a floor scattered with shiny silver quarters. reflections of neon. there's a fourth santa here, face down in a red pool. the suit is far too big for him. not that it matters now.}
<L>__{exterior snow filled ravine night}
<A>__{where the fifth and final santa lies at the edge of a ravine, which plummets a hundred feet down. the man rests precariously atop the slope, upside down, eyes closed. his burned suit is smoldering. he has a sly but tired face, late 20's, sandy hair, cold and scarred. this is rudy duncan. he opens his eyes.}
<C>__{rudy }
<D>__{i never was much for the holidays.}
