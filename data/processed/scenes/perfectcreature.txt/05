<A>__{we see a city, seething with smoke from coal fires, steam from engines, alien distorted victorian spires are silhouetted against the moody, moonlit sky which is literally filled with dirigibles and strange flying machines that seem victorian, of the industrial revolution, but that are also strangely futuristic. it is 1969, but not our 1969.}
<L>__{ext: street night}
<A>__{a street. the look of the film and the night is silver, almost metallic moonlit skies. a hazy mist hangs in the air. wet, steel pools of water on the dark footpath where a man stands. he stares up at a zeppelin passing overhead, its shadow obscuring him briefly until it passes away. then we see him. the man is handsome, in a perfectly cut long wool jacket; dark gray. he wears perfectly shiny black shoes and we can see the surrounding street reflected in them; victorian, gothic buildings. this man is silus. he surveys the street. while the houses are beautiful, they're run down. silus his eyes are the purest light gray you have ever seen takes a long long inhale through his nose, his eyes closing briefly as if trying to sense smell something. he stops the breath and opens his eyes. they are clear, full of purpose. he bends down to the footpath, runs his hand along its surface, almost caressing it. he closes his eyes. the camera moves in, to end close on silus' ear. as this happens the soundtrack all the noises in the night become amplified. we see silus' face, see him concentrating intently. we hear several individual noises. first a very quiet pitter patter. cut to a cat, stealthily moving between some thorny rose bushes. cut to silus again; concentrating even more. now the distant sound of trickling water. cut to a drain pipe, leaking. cut to silus once more. this time we can hear "plop, plop, plop." cut to a pool of water. then "plop" as a drop hits it. the drop is not water. the drop is a red liquid, thick, now dispersing in the water. and another drop, "plop." high speed crane up from this pool, up up the side of a building to end on a face in the shadows. we can see reflective, gleaming eyes. and a mouth, with blood dripping from it. cut to silus again. his eyes flicking open; we see the footpath reflected in those perfect light gray eyes. music brooding, ancient begins to hum as silus slowly rises, as if his limbs have the power to make him float, so perfect and powerful are they. a small smile has appeared on his lips; it is the smile of a man who knows that something very dark, something very dangerous, is close by. slowly his hand slips into his jacket. he holds it there, watching, surveying the street immediately ahead of him for the slightest movement. he sees it. on the wall of an old georgian mansion across the road, a shape on the side of the wall, almost imperceptible, hidden in the shadows and brickwork. a creature on the side of the wall. silus begins to move forward now, everything in perfect shining silver slow motion. as he moves forward he pulls a gun from his jacket it is silver, organic and glass, art nouveaux styling and points it ahead of him as he glides forward. the creature on the wall senses the movement coming towards it, moves a little and then, like a spider, scrambles along the side of the wall, heading away from us. silus fires. a bullet of silver explodes from the gun, seems almost to hang in the air for a moment, reflecting the moon above, before hurtling at high speed towards its target. the shell explodes the wall next to the creature, who stops suddenly in the light so that we can see it. a man. with reflective animal eyes and blood on his purple lips. and teeth; the teeth of a vampire. this creature immediately dives from the wall to the ground, just avoiding another two bullets that crash into the wall. la as the man falls directly towards the camera. silus now rushes forward, holding his gun out in front of him; he moves forward gracefully. he can see the man skillfully climbing up an adjacent derelict building. silus tries to follow but his way is blocked by wire and fencing. he raises his gun towards the man once more, but he is gone. close on silus' enigmatic face. those eyes. and in his mouth, two perfectly pointed fangs. cut to}
