<D>__{my first husband was unimpressive. i found him in bed with his big breasted secretary when i came home early from the maldives. so unoriginal, it made me feel sorry for him. my second husband was a pinch more creative. cheated on me with my sister but made me believe that i was insane for being suspicious. at last some intrigue, some mind games though my sister's two year old eventually gave them up. but my last husband he was a gem. a veritable master at covering his tracks. i poured over his phone records, intercepted his credit card bills, had him followed on countless occasions and never found a single shred of evidence. it wasn't until he died that i found out about the property he owned with his austrian mistress. but the real master, i have to say is me. three husbands countless boyfriends, and i haven't been caught yet.}
