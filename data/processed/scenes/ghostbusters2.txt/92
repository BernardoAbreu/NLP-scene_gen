<L>__{interior dana's apartment night}
<A>__{dana brings oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet. she's wearing a robe over her nightgown, preparing to bathe the baby. she turns the taps on the old claw footed bathtub, checks the water temperature, then turns away and starts to undress the baby.}

<P>__{(talking sweetly to the baby)}
<D>__{look at you. i think we got more food on your shirt than we got in your mouth.}
<B>__{bathtub}
<A>__{the water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the bottom of the tub. dana reaches over and turns off the water without looking into the tub. when she turns away, both taps start to spin by themselves and the tub flexes and bulges.}
<B>__{dana}
<A>__{still unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath into the tub.}
<B>__{bathtub}
<A>__{the rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the bubble bath.}
<B>__{dana}
<A>__{she picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub. she is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to close up around the baby like a hugh mouth. dana screams, snatches the baby away and runs from the room clutching oscar to her bosom as the bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime.}
