<L>__{ext farm dawn}
<A>__{the purple horizon is turning orange, but it's still quite dark when a crusty old farm hand, rake, opens the creaking door of a stable and, with a flashlight, leads three horses out into the morning breeze. two dogs, a lab and a spaniel, romp at his heels as rake opens a log gate. two of the untethered horses trot obediently into a large corral. the third, a beautiful stallion, resists, snorting, tossing its head in high spirit.}
<C>__{rake}
<D>__{get in there, lucky. quit horsin' around. get in.}
<A>__{"lucky" moves into the corral, strutting proudly.}
<C>__{rake }
<D>__{swear. if i didn't know you was just an animal, i'd say you was all full of yourself. get in there!}
<A>__{rake waves his flashlight, not meanly, there is clearly a great deal of affection here. rake shuts the gate behind the stallion, who begins to gallop around happily inside the fence. all seems lovely, until... ...the dogs suddenly go on pointerior their ears perk. they sniff the air...and begin to whine.}
<C>__{rake }
<D>__{what's wrong with you two?}
<A>__{ker raakk! a startling sound. rake turns to find lucky and the other horses, their eyes flaring, trying to kick their way out of the fencing. they seem terrified.}
