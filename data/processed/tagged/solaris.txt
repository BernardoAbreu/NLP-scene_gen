<A>__{first, over black, we hear the sound of a light rain. then:}
<C>__{a man's voice}
<D>__{i'm not a poet. i've never moved anyone with my words.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe that's why they chose me.}
<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{a mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky. rain continues to fall. maybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light (or is it the sky?). something vaguely unsettling.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior bedroom morning}
<A>__{still, the sound of rain is heard.}
<B>__{a man}
<L>__{40s, lies on his side in bed, staring at us.}
<A>__{he has not been sleeping. in fact, judging from his distant expression, he has not slept in ages.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a vehicle through. the man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle. he is accompanied by a medium sized labrador, and seems in no particular hurry. the sound of tires appear and grow in intensity. the man, without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal. the dog obeys as the man moves off the road. the vehicle hurtles past him its engine quiet, its windows darkened spraying muddy debris in its wake. seconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop.}
<B>__{the man}
<A>__{stops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously still. the car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the man, who remains motionless. when the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns transparent and we see a well dressed bureaucrat in the rear seat. his demeanor is pleasant and professional.}
<D>__{well dressed bureaucrat dr. kelvin?}
<A>__{the man he is addressing, who we now understand is chris kelvin, stares back at him.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior cabin day}
<A>__{the contrast between the cabin's rustic aesthetic and the aggressively high tech equipment contained therein isn't as jarring as you might imagine. kelvin is seated in front of a desk, scrolling through a text readout on a flat, transparent holographic screen. behind him is the well dressed bureaucrat from the car, and two others: a woman in her 50s and a man in his 30s. they are also well groomed. each of their suits are embroidered with a small but distinctive logo of some sort that composes the acronym dba. kelvin scrolls through several menus, hits a few keys, and a digitized video image appears on his screen: a man, unshaven, looking into the camera. the man, gibarian, looks very tired and somewhat apologetic. the lower part of the screen has a time of day and date display that reads: 0221 hrs 11 14 31.}
<C>__{gibarian}
<D>__{we take off into the cosmos, ready for anything: solitude, hardship, exhaustion, death. we're proud of ourselves, in a way. but our enthusiasm is a sham. we don't want to conquer the cosmos we want to extend the boundaries of earth to the cosmos. we are only seeking man. we don't want other worlds. we want mirrors.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe we don't need to know what it is, or why. maybe just knowing that it is should be enough.}
<A>__{gibarian stares at the camera for a long moment before switching it off and ending the transmission. kelvin sits back. the visitors exchange glances.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior space capsule}
<A>__{close on kelvin. we hold on him a long time, as a myriad of readouts scroll and flash across his face. a slit of sunlight glides slowly through frame.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{kelvin}
<A>__{in the same capsule, a month later. he is asleep.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{kelvin}
<A>__{in the same capsule, two months later. he is dictating some coordinates to earth. he absently scratches his heavy growth of beard.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{kelvin}
<A>__{two months later still. he is looking out his small, rectangular window, and for the fist time we cut around to see the approaching planet: solaris. kelvin stares at it, hypnotized. it has a translucent quality, as though it is lit from within, and its undulating, ocean like surface slowly changes colors. kelvin's attention is diverted as an orbiting ship, the prometheus, edges into frame.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{prometheus, this is athena 7, on approach, do you read me?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{prometheus, this is athena 7, on approach, do you read me?}
<A>__{no response. he exhales and types on a keyboard.}
<L>__{exterior space}
<A>__{the athena 7, sporting a dba logo, advances toward the prometheus.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior prometheus}
<A>__{kelvin, in a space suit, climbs with some difficulty out of the athena 7, which has come to rest in the docking bay of the prometheus. several exploratory pods fill the remainder of the area. kelvin gets his bearings and looks around, but sees no sign of life.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{empty. (note: except for some robotic, non speaking characters: the automated taskmasters. these are small, bug like repair units that constantly roam the ship, fixing things. their tiny hum is virtually silent, and we see them all the time on the prometheus. they can adhere to any surface at any angle.) kelvin, now out of his space suit and holding a small carrying case and a duffle bag, moves on.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior gibarian's room}
<A>__{ransacked. kelvin registers it, then moves to the corner of the room where the computer terminal rests. within moments he has discovered gibarian has recorded a video message for him to replay.}
<B>__{video}
<A>__{gibarian addressing the camera. he appears to be lucid, but extremely fatigued.}
<C>__{gibarian}
<D>__{hi, chris.}
<P>__{(a light smile)}
<D>__{i'm so glad you came.}
<P>__{(beat, the smile fades)}
<D>__{i still have a little time, and i want to tell you something. to warn you. by now you know about me, or if you don't, get snow or sartorius to tell you; it doesn't matter.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i didn't lose my mind. you should be able to tell from this video. i'm not mad.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if it happens to you, remember that it isn't madness.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you should know, i'm in favor of destroying solaris. i know that's... illegal. and unethical. and irresponsible. but it's the only way to make it stop.}
<A>__{a long moment of silence is broken by a noise on the video, which draws gibarian's attention offscreen.}
<C>__{gibarian}
<P>__{(addressing whoever made the noise)}
<D>__{cut that out. do you hear me?}
<A>__{gibarian switches off the video. the computer screen freezes the last recorded frame and overlays a readout indicating the file has ended.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{empty. but there is a door at the end of it, slightly open. kelvin moves toward it.}
<L>__{interior room}
<A>__{a figure, seated with its back to the door, turns to see kelvin enter. this is snow. he looks kelvin up and down, his expression wary and alert.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{snow. didn't you hear me radio? i'm kelvin.}
<A>__{a long beat. snow just watches him.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{yes. we heard.}
<A>__{kelvin takes a step forward, and snow recoils.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{what's wrong? what happened to gibarian?}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{he's dead.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{suicide.}
<A>__{snow exhales, then looks up as though he's remembered something.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{you didn't bring any chocolate, did you?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{snow}
<P>__{(musing)}
<D>__{i love chocolate. i realized just yesterday how much i love it.}
<P>__{(beat, then he recovers)}
<D>__{i thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, i've been thinking about it.}
<A>__{a long beat as kelvin stares at snow.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{what happened here?}
<A>__{snow lies back in his bunk.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{i can't talk just now. i'm too tired.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{where's sartorius?}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{in his lab. he won't let you in.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<P>__{(leaving)}
<D>__{he'll let me in.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{kelvin, if you see anything unusual...}
<A>__{kelvin stops, but doesn't turn around.}

<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<P>__{(inside, muffled)}
<D>__{you have to give me your word you won't come in. then i will come out.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{sartorius cracks the door open and slithers through the slit and into the hallway. he is of obvious intelligence and not to be messed with; contentious, intimidating when he wants to be, and probably brilliant. kelvin eyes him suspiciously.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{what happened to gibarian?}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{didn't you talk to snow?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{i want to hear your version.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{who, here, could possibly care what you want? at best, you're employee of the month for the highest bidder in the solaris auction. they have no idea what's going on up here. they've never even been in space. and i'm supposed to listen to you?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{i am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation. now: what happened to him?}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{the same thing that could happen to any of us.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{where's his body?}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{in the lab. with her, probably.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{her? who are you talking about?}
<A>__{sartorius is grabbed by something on the other side of his door. he struggles to keep his composure.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{his last wish was to be buried on earth. in dirt, he said. "i want to buried in dirt." what a clown.}
<A>__{sartorius is losing the battle with whomever or whatever is on the other side of his door.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{they shouldn't let people like you into space.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{just so you know: i'm not going back until i understand what it is. i am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then i will go home.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{listen }
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{we're done. oh, i should tell you, i don't trust snow. there's something wrong with him.}
<A>__{sartorius rotates and zips back into his room. as the door closes kelvin sees a flash of another figure in sartorius' room. the glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the other figure could have been.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior corridor day}
<A>__{kelvin walks, exploring the ship. he sees something that stops him:}
<B>__{a nude woman}
<A>__{black, early 20s, slipping across a corridor up ahead. kelvin gives chase. he sees her turn a corner, but by the time he gets there, she is gone.}

<A>__{snow is lying on his bunk.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{is there anybody else here?}
<C>__{snow}
<P>__{(sits up a little)}
<D>__{why, who did you see?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{gibarian warned me. he left me a message.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{who was it?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{she was real. where did she come from?}
<A>__{snow looks at him but doesn't respond.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{tell me. i won't think you're insane.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{oh, that's a relief.}
<A>__{snow lies back down.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{where did she come from?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{how much sleep do you need?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{how much sleep?}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{how long can you go without sleep?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{that depends.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door.}
<A>__{snow rolls over, away from kelvin.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior space}
<A>__{solaris. quiet, but still active somehow.}
<C>__{kelvin }

<A>__{kelvin speaks into a video communication device. as he does, we see images of the things and people he describes.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{interviews with the surviving members and a perusal of the deceased's personal effects indicate he was suffering from severe depression with psychotic features, along with bouts of hypomania, dementia, delirium, and primary insomnia. all of these symptoms, combined with a profound sense of isolation, are commonly found in studies of low stimulation environments, particularly long range space travel. snow and sartorius show indications of depression, including dysthymic and bipolar i; a variety of stress disorders, including acute and posttraumatic; and suggestions of agoraphobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and hypersomnia. i emphasize these are preliminary opinions on my part. i will attempt to convince snow and sartorius to return to earth, but as they currently view me as an intruder of sorts, this may take some time.}

<L>__{interior kelvin's room}
<A>__{later. kelvin is lying down. the lights are out, and he is trying to sleep. after a moment, he gets up, checks the lock on his door, and lies back down. then he gets up and moves a chair in front of the door, and lies back down. then he gets up and puts two heavy cases on top of the chair, and lies back down. laughing to himself, he drifts off to sleep. silence.}

<A>__{asleep. then:}
<L>__{interior train day}
<A>__{continued silence, and: rheya, 30s, staring at us, practically daring us to look away. her obvious intelligence and confidence make her extremely compelling, along with the fact that it was her parted lips we were looking at a moment ago. her expression indicates she's in a very raw emotional state.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{kelvin is the person she has locked eyes with on the train. he is younger here; not just in age, but in spirit. the contrast with his older self is striking.}
<B>__{back to kelvin}
<A>__{asleep on the ship. after a beat:}
<L>__{extreme close up:}
<A>__{rheya's lips. except the circumstance is clearly different: it's darker and there isn't the side to side shimmy of the train car.}
<B>__{a wider view}
<A>__{reveals that rheya is not sitting on the train she is sitting in kelvin's room on the prometheus, right now. she is staring at kelvin and she is ethereal in her stillness.}
<B>__{kelvin}
<A>__{awakens, blinks, and slowly recognizes her. if he is not entirely surprised it is because he has obviously dreamed of rheya before. he looks at her, simply.}
<B>__{rheya}
<A>__{stands and makes her way to kelvin. without hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore each other and we see all of it happen and two things are obvious: first, they have done this before, and two: they haven't done it in some time.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior kelvin's room}
<A>__{kelvin is asleep, rheya in his arms. he wakes up and looks at her, perplexed. after a beat he rises to sit on the edge of the bed. a wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to his forehead. rheya opens her eyes.}

<D>__{how do you mean?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{chris, what's wrong?}
<A>__{hearing his name spoken by her (and those particular words, perhaps) nearly causes kelvin to scream. he stands and moves to the chair. rheya watches him.}

<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{i will be right back.}
<A>__{she is trying to accommodate him but her fear of being left alone is palpable, even excessive. he sees this and puts his arms on her shoulders to comfort her.}
