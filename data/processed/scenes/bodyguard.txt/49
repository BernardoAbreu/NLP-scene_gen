<L>__{exterior marron estate gate guard house day}
<A>__{in a big closeup on a black and white tv screen, we see devaney's immaculate convertible mercedes 500sl as it roars up the drive. frank, henry and fletcher watch in the newly erected guard house. the area is greatly changed. there is a uniformed guard with an impressive array of switches, lights and phones at his command. there are several tv screens; one of them shows a series of endlessly panning shots from cameras at the rear of the grounds. on the other, the mercedes kicks up dust from the last few curves in the drive. fletcher shakes his head. he's seen it all before.}
