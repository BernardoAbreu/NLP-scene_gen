<L>__{exterior ray's trailer day}
<A>__{a pick up truck draped with a "wide load" banner leads two semis hauling halves of a double wide mobile home wrapped in plastic, rippling in the wind. ricky stops at the massive sight, twisting at his fly, trying not to pee himself. t.j. comes out of the shed. the doubles come to a stop and idle in the yard. guy versailles, pot bellied, in a green velour running suit, squeezes out of his truck. on the door: "massena modular and mobile homes, new and reconditioned." ricky grabs a rope hanging off one of the doubles and tries to climb the side of it. the truck driver looks down from his cab.}

<D>__{that's our house!}
<A>__{he breaks away from her and runs down the road chasing after the semis. ray chases after ricky until he runs out of steam and stops, panting. she catches up to him and tries to hug him. he pushes her away. she gets down on her knees and takes his face in her hands.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{we're gonna get it back.}
<A>__{she picks him up and walks back to the trailer. ricky looks out mournfully at the trailers disappearing down the road.}
