<L>__{exterior new york apartment establishing day interior simon's apartment day}
<A>__{shades drawn. simon is a wheelchair... the phone rings. he goes to answer... the phone across the bed so that reaching for the phone is a brief but difficult struggle... he grunts with pain, hope and anxiety as he answers.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{hello?... yes... sure... finally, huh? why, "finally"? because i called you so many times. maybe}
<P>__{(relief)}
<D>__{oh, boy... i was hoping it was something like that. you didn't get one of them, huh? 'cause i mean it wasn't only your office it was your home, hotel and the cigar club you like in san francisco. no sarcastic... of course. i believe you. no, don't fire anyone... please. maybe i'm wrong about the 20 times. take a breath...}
<P>__{(more)}
<D>__{so, you miss me a little? hey, strike the question how's the case going? really. fantastic. i didn't hear. i haven't been watching. great. just great. i'm so happy. whoopie! me? well, i'm mending. no, i look fine. well, some of the damage might still be noticeable if you look closely...}
<A>__{he runs a hand across his scarred and still bloated and beaten face...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{carl, i need some help and you're the logical one to turn to.}
<P>__{(aghast)}
<D>__{no! not 'cause i blame you for what happened. i hardly get how you can ever think that. no, i'm not being sarcastic.}
<P>__{(trying to figure it out)}
<D>__{i guess because you hired the guy who did this you think... no, i am a sarcastic person. well, if you must know, the reason i said you were the logical person is because you always told me how you thought i was this great person who made you feel good about humanity and everything. you do remembering saying that? well, whew. okay, so carl. i hate asking but this money thing is ridiculously serious...}
<A>__{he picks up an index card from his night stand and takes the leap reading the text he prepared in advance.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{"will you please loan me money? i will pay you back. i will give you whatever percentage of my income i don't absolutely need until i do. it will take a while. but i don't know what i will do if you say"... that.}
<P>__{(as he listens)}
<D>__{i understand... yes... no, i do.}
<P>__{(a bit of boldness)}
<D>__{but you know, you know you didn't even ask how much, carl? well, frank has no right to discuss how much i'm in hock... no, you're right not the pointerior so... what have you been up to??? uh huh... oh, the group show... how was it? well, i'm not surprised that there's that much talent around... great... look gotta go... no, you shouldn't feel that way at all... take care, you, too... you, too... good bye.}
<P>__{(as he hangs up)}
<D>__{pal o' mine.}
<A>__{it's very quiet. long shot simon a lonely figure who now holds his good hand up to his face and appears on the verge of enormous emotional release camera moves toward him as if to rendezvous with the moment of catharsis... ... but simon is denied even this small luxury as the camera abruptly adjusts just as he begins sobbing to focus on the door opening and melvin and verdell entering the room.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{maybe i will bring him some food by.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{thank you for walking him.}
<A>__{simon wheels away from melvin.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{if you'll excuse me i'm not feeling so well.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{it smells like shit in here?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{go away.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{that cleaning woman doesn't...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{please, just leave.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{where are all your queer party friends?}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(his first shout)}
<D>__{get out.}
<A>__{melvin pauses simon weeping... verdell looks at simon with concern. melvin is thrown. moved?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{rot in hell, melvin.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{no need to stop being a lady... quit worrying you'll be back on your knees in no time.}
<A>__{simon swings his arm and cast at melvin the sudden attack jolts melvin but not as much as what follows.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{is this fun for you? well, you lucky devil... it just gets better and better. i am losing my apartment and frank wants me to promise to paint hotter subjects and to beg my parents, who haven't called, for help... and i won't. and i don't want to paint anymore.}
<A>__{melvin has made for the door... simon blocks him.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{so the life i was trying for is over. the life i had is gone and i am feeling so damn sorry for myself that it is difficult to breathe. right times for you huh, melvin. the gay neighbor is terrified...}
<P>__{(a sudden screamed}
<D>__{word surprises them}
<P>__{both)}
<D>__{terrified... lucky you, you're here for rock bottom... me wallowing in self pity in front of you, you absolute horror of a human being...}
<A>__{as simon works to stop crying, melvin is weird with discomfort.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{well, i will do one thing for you that might cheer you up.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{get out.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{don't piss on a gift, tough guy. you want to know why the dog prefers me... it's not affection. it's a trick.}
<A>__{simon looks up, his mood turning on a dime he's rapt... melvin comes and stands by his wheelchair.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i carry bacon in my pocket.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{oh, my gosh.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(hands him bacon)}
<D>__{now we'll both call him.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{come on, sweetheart...}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{yo, yo, yo...}
<A>__{verdell goes like a bullet to melvin... who is totally surprised and staggered by the implications. true love and such.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{would you leave now, please?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{stupid dog.}
<P>__{(to simon)}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<A>__{he exits... looking apologetically at simon in stoic ruin.}
