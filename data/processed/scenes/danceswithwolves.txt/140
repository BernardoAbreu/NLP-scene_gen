<L>__{exterior killing ground day}
<A>__{little butchering parties cluster around each fallen buffalo.}
<L>__{exterior temporary camp night}
<A>__{flame begins to lick at each of the bodies and we match dissolve the clusters of people have become groups surrounding fires at the temporary camp.}
<L>__{exterior feasting fire night}
<A>__{all over camp people are crowding around fires, feasting on fresh meat. children are playing everywhere, the dogs are having a field day with scraps and the voices of the people are happy. at a little distance, we see lieutenant dunbar and wind in his hair excusing themselves from one of the fires. they start toward us. wind in his hair is sucking on a rib bone and seems to show no sign of slowing down his celebrating. dunbar, following a couple paces behind, is a different story. he's had it. he spreads his hands to indicate an over sized belly.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{look i'm full... i can't tell the story again.}
<A>__{wind in his hair doesn't seem to hear. he points at the epaulettes on dunbar's tunic.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{wind in his hair reaches out and fingers the gold lieutenant's bars. he fingers a couple of the brass buttons as well. the tunic is something he obviously puts much store in.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<P>__{(signing)}
<D>__{you want to try... put it on.}
<A>__{he unbuttons the tunic.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{he sloughs off the tunic and hands it over. wind in his hair slips out of the magnificent bone pipe breastplate he's wearing and gives it to dunbar as he wriggles into the tunic. the fit is too tight, the material too scratchy but those things are of little consequence to wind in his hair. he loves the tunic. with urging signs he asks the lieutenant to put on the breastplate. dunbar slips it over his head and wind in his hair helps him with the ties. now it's the lieutenant's turn to be amazed. the breastplate as craftsmanship at its finest. he runs his fingers over the ridges of bone now covering him from neck to waist. he looks up at wind in his hair. the warrior nods approvingly, as though a good deal has heen struck.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{this is too much... i can't take this...}
<A>__{but for wind in his hair it is already a trade. wind in his hair spots the next fireside and veers toward it. dunbar holds him back.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i can't... no more...}
<A>__{wind in his hair grins. he holds up a single finger.}
<C>__{wind in his hair}
<D>__{one more... eat...}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i can't, i'm full... very full...}
<A>__{still holding up the finger, he guides dunbar into the firelight of the next party. immediately, men jump up to greet the celebrities. women begin to saw off more meat.}
