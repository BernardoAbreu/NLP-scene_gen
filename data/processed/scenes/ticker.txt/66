<A>__{beard speeds around another corner, the lumbering van has difficulty keeping up and loses sight of the grenada for a moment.}
<L>__{exterior another street day}
<A>__{the grenada speeds up, heading towards the police station up ahead. the bomb squad van appears and speeds up.}
<B>__{on the sidewalk}
<A>__{swan stands discreetly in a phone booth, watching as...}
<B>__{on the street}
<A>__{beard steers towards a parked squad car next to the station on collision course. at the last second, beard dives from the moving car, hits the pavements and rolls. the grenada crashes into the squad car... but no explosion. the bomb squad van skids to a stop as two uniformed officers rush out of the station. beard has rolled to his feet and is now sprinting off down the street. pooch and t.j. jump out of the van (leaving a barking schnoz inside) and sprint towards the grenada, guns drawn. pooch is quickly huffing and puffing. t.j. continues after beard as pooch moves towards the grenada. the uniforms follow t.j. glass on his harley appears from behind the van. at the far end of the street the studebaker rumbles into view, followed by a squad car, lights flashing. everyone closing in on beard. t.j. aims and yells at beard.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{police, freeze!}
<A>__{beard whirls around, spraying automatic weapon fire at t.j. and the uniforms they hit the pavement. a few nearby pedestrians scream and drop to the ground. reilly jumps out of his studebaker as beard turns his fire on him, blowing out his windshield. back at the grenada, pooch ducks for cover by the open driver's door. glass runs his harley behind a parked car. the squad car behind reilly skids to a stop and as beard shifts his aim, t.j. and reilly each pump two shots into beard's torso. beard spins around, drops dead silence on the street. relief all around. everyone stands back up. t.j.'s jaw drops at the sight of actually having hit the suspect with his bullets.}
<B>__{at the grenada}
<A>__{pooch exhales in relief, then hears beeping coming from the front seat of the car. he looks in to see the briefcase open, countdown ticking away.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{oh... damn.}
<A>__{ka booooom!!! the grenada explodes in a massive fire ball, throwing nearby glass off his feet. everyone else drops back to the ground, covering their heads. down the street at the phone booth swan grins and walks away down an alley. we can hear the cry of schnoz, wailing from the front seat of van.}
