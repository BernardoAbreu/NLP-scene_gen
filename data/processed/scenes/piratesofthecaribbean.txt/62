<D>__{my father. william turner?}
<A>__{jack says nothing. will has lost the patience for guile.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{i'm not a simpleton. at the jail it was only after you learned my name that you agreed to help.}
<P>__{(a smile)}
<D>__{since that's what i wanted, i didn't press the matter. but now }
<A>__{{an accusation} you knew my father. jack considers his reply settles on 'truth.'}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i knew him. probably one of the few who knew him as william turner. most everyone just called him bill, or 'bootstrap' bill.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{'bootstrap?'}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{good man. good pirate. and clever " i never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. when you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.}

<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{that's not true.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i swear, you look just like him.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's not true that my father was a pirate.}

<C>__{will}
<D>__{he was a merchant marine! he was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules }
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{you think your father is the only man who ever lived the glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? there's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. and they're all 'merchant marines.'}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{my father did not think of my mother his family as a burden.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sure because he could always go pirating.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{my father was not a pirate!}
<A>__{will's sword is out, levelled at jack. jack gives him a disbelieving look, sighs.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{put it away, will. it's not worth getting beat again.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you didn't beat me. you ignored the rules of engagement. in a fair fight, i'd kill you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?}
<A>__{he kicks a lever on a wench. the sail boom whips around and slams will in the chest sweeping him off the ship. his sword clatters onto the deck. will dangles above the water. jack slips a loop of rope around the wheel to hold the course. picks up the sword and pokes at will with it. will hand over hands away from the blade, to the end of the boom.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{as long as you're just hanging there, pay attention. must, should, do, don't, shall, shall not those are just suggestions. there are only two absolute rules.}

<C>__{jack }
<D>__{what a man can do. and what a man can i t do.}
<A>__{will looks away, not interested.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{for instance: you can accept that your father was a pirate and still a good man... or you can't. now me, i can sail this ship to tortuga, by myself. . .}
<P>__{(will looks alarmed)}
<D>__{but i can't just let you drown.}
<A>__{jack swings the boom back in. will drops to the deck. jack holds the hilt of the sword out. will takes it. glares at jack, considers what he'll do nexterior jack watches him coolly. will turns and strides to his spot on the deck, sits down, and resumes sharpening his sword: shhhk shhhk shhhk}
