<L>__{exterior village yei, sudan day}
<A>__{the pickup arrives and sam, deng, and the other soldiers hop out... and this is what they see: complete devastation. 30 or 40 bodies mutilated and stacked outside smoking tukuls. some children already here, on their knees, weeping next to the corpses of their parents. if you could smell the air it would smell of burnt flesh and death. sam silent, aghast, just staring at the horror all around him... ... and now we see green shorts and his sister arriving at the village... moving to their family's tukul and discovering their mother and father piled outside. naked and burned alive. and the sister falls onto her mother's corpse and begins to wail as green shorts stands there frozen staring down at his dead parents and suddenly movement! from inside the tukul... a small dog... a family pet... darting into the open... running across the dirt... green shorts going after it, yelling his name... sam watching the boy chasing after his dog, rounding a corner out of sight... ... for a moment... ... just the boy's voice calling after his dog... and then... boooom! a muffled burst in the distance sam, deng, and the other soldiers running out of the village toward the explosion...}
