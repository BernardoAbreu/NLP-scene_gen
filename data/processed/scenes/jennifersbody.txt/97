<L>__{interior murphy pool continuous}
<A>__{needy staggers toward the pool, which is surrounded by an extraterrestrial glow. chip's moaning is almost unbearable. needy stares into the abyss and claps her hands over her mouth. jennifer is waist deep in the dirty water, flinging chip against the wall like a rag doll. he's still conscious, but his skin on his chest has been ripped off to expose his ribs. jennifer is chewing happily. chip looks at needy, his face a mask of agony.}
<C>__{chip}
<P>__{(mouthing)}
<D>__{needy!}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{holy crap!}
<A>__{jennifer begins gnawing on chip's neck, so engaged in the task that she doesn't notice needy. needy climbs up on the diving board and crosses herself.}
<C>__{needy }
<D>__{saint jude, patron saint of hopeless causes: please give me the power to crush this bitch.}
<A>__{jennifer looks up with demonic, bloodshot eyes just as needy leaps off the diving board. needy lands on jennifer's shoulders, taking her out. she wraps her legs around jennifer's neck and drags her under the water. jennifer emerges. needy grabs her by the hair and girly slaps her furiously across the face. then she spots the pepper spray lying by the side of the pool. she grabs it and sprays it in jennifer's eyes. jennifer shrieks and vomits nasty, spiny gore all over needy and chip.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{fuck this j.v. shit!}
<A>__{jennifer rockets straight up into the air like a goddess, hovering ten feet above the pool. her eyes burn. her skin is corpselike. she's drenched from head to toe in the prickly ooze.}
<C>__{chip}
<P>__{(croaking)}
<D>__{she can fly?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{she's just hovering, chip. it's not that impressive.}
<A>__{jennifer speaks in a metallic, demonic sounding voice.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{god, do you have to undermine everything i do? you're such a player hater.}
<A>__{needy glares at jennifer, surprisingly fearless.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{you're a jerk.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{nice insult, lizzie mcguire. got any more harsh digs?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{you know what? you were never a good friend. ever. even when we were little. you used to steal my toys and pour lemonade on my bed and make me be ugly ashley when we played barbies!}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{and now i'm eating your boyfriend! see? at least i'm consistent.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{why do you need him? huh?}
<A>__{she begins to weep.}
<C>__{needy }
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{why do you need the one guy who's ever liked me? you can have anyone, jennifer!}
<C>__{needy }
<D>__{the cutest guy in school. the mailman. a teacher. you could probably even have a huge star like chad michael murray. so why chip? why him? is it just to piss me off? or is it because you're insecure?}
<A>__{jennifer floats in midair toward the pool deck and drifts down, landing on her feet. needy crawls out of the pool and faces her down.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i am not insecure. god, what a joke! how could i be insecure? i was the snowflake queen!}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{yeah, two years ago. when you were socially relevant.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i am still socially relevant!}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{you were skinny then, too!}
<A>__{a look of abject horror on jennifer's face. she reels back against the chain link fence, her eyes blazing.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i'm gonna eat your soul and shit it out, lesnicki.}
<A>__{her voice is now an unearthly growl. in the background, chip is slowly, painfully pulling a pool skimmer with an eight foot handle off the pool deck.}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(trembling)}
<D>__{i thought you only murdered boys.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i go both ways.}
<A>__{she hurtles herself toward needy, roaring, her eyes white hot, her jaws agape. she's monstrous. chip suddenly stumbles in front of needy and holds the handle of the pool skimmer in front of them like a spear. as jennifer flies forward at demonic speed, she impales her entire torso on the handle. needy screams. there's a beat of deafening silence. chip collapses on the pool deck. jennifer rises uncertainly to her feet, "shishkebabbed" on the giant skimmer. with effort, she pulls the handle out of her body in several stages.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{ow ow ow.}
<A>__{needy watches, and realizes jennifer is injured. blood drips onto the pool deck.}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{we hurt you...}
<A>__{blood trickles out of jennifer's wound. she tries to plug the hole with her hand.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{got a tampon?}
<A>__{needy shakes her head mutely.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{thought i'd ask. you seemed like you might be pluggin'.}
<A>__{she begins to climb the fence, wincing in pain, then glances over her shoulder at needy and chip.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{fuck this noise. i'm out. you losers are more trouble then you're worth.}
<A>__{she continues climbing.}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(emotional)}
<D>__{why give up now? he's almost dead! get your bulimic ass back here and kill us both!}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{nah. i mean, you say i've been a bad friend all these years. i might as well throw you a bone.}
<A>__{she smirks and jumps over the fence, stumbling off into the distance. needy watches her, her eyes narrowing with hate. once jennifer has disappeared, needy turns her attention to chip, who is barely alive. she stares in horror at his torn arm and exposed ribs, then falls to her knees over his body.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{oh, chip!}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{needy. you saved me.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i'm gonna call for help.}
<A>__{she reaches into chip's pocket and pulls out his beat up cell phone. she wipes off the prickly ooze with her hand.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{oh no, i'm out of minutes!}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i think 911 is always a free call.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{oh yeah. you're right.}
<A>__{needy dials to no avail. the phone is hopelessly clogged with ooze. she knocks it against the deck.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{it's not working. it's full of jennifer goo.}
<A>__{chip begins gagging and coughing. he rolls onto his back, his eyelids fluttering.}
<C>__{chip}
<P>__{(faintly)}
<D>__{hey, i'm going somewhere...}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{no! you're not going anywhere!}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{i'm toast, needy. i'm definitely gonna die. i think i already died before you were here, but i woke up when i heard your voice.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{yeah me too. and you look hot in that dress.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{you're clearly delirious.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{no. when you're dying, you can see everything a lot clearer. you can see what's true and what's not. the things that are true have this glowing halo of light around them, like a picture of the baby jesus, or barbara walters when they use the special lens. and i know for sure that you're totally hot.}
<A>__{needy begins to sob hoarsely.}
<C>__{chip }
<D>__{you'd better get out of here. the police are going to come and i don't want them to, you know, make a mistake.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i'm never leaving.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{but i have to go.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{chip's eyes close. his face relaxes. he's gone. needy wails at the top of her lungs. she rests her head against his mutilated chest, oblivious to the blood and bone.}
