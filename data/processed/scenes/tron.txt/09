<L>__{interior cell}
<A>__{as the captive falls against one wall from the force of the guard's shove. the cell is small, one man, and in each wall next to the door, an opening gives a view of the next cell. through one of the windows, we can see the back of another captive program, and through the other, a face looking over at the newcomer. the character speaks:}
<C>__{program }
<D>__{welcome to luxury living.}
<A>__{the new captive looks up, nervous.}
<C>__{crom}
<D>__{uh, thanks, but... i don't even know what i'm doing here.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{you believe in the users?}
<C>__{crom}
<D>__{sure, if i don't have a user, then who wrote me?}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{that's what you're doing here. master control program's been snapping up all us programs who believe...if he thinks you're useful, he takes over all your functions so he gets bigger... an' if he can't use you, he sends you down here to the game grid to get the bits blasted outta you. what's your name?}
<C>__{crom}
<D>__{crom.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{i'm ram. they'll train you for the games, but ... well, i hope you make it okay. hey, what's going on in the other sectors? i've been stuck in this grid for 200 microcycles.}
<A>__{he points to several hash marks on his cell wall.}
<C>__{crom}
<D>__{it's murder out there. you can't even travel around your own microcircuits without permission from that master control creep. hauling me down here to play games...who does he calculate he is?}
<P>__{(holds his head in his hands)}
<D>__{if only tron was still around...}
<A>__{he looks up as ram makes a noise under his breath. ram has a strange, still expression on his face.}
<C>__{crom}
<D>__{you ever see that guy in action? hundred percent independent. mcp couldn't tell him what to }
<A>__{he stops. ram is looking over his shoulder.}
<C>__{crom}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what's wrong? what did i say?}
<A>__{there's a slight noise from cell beyond ram's.}
