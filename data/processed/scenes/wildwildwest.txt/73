<B>__{night}
<A>__{west leans into gordon's ear.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{hang 'm...!}
<A>__{suddenly, there's a volley of shots from some cracker sharpshooters. west responds with an amazing display of rapid fire marksmanship, picking off half a dozen of loveless's shooters, even while the carriage bumps wildly on its getaway. blamblamblamblam!!!}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(still pissed, to gordon)}
<D>__{hang'm!?!}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(to rita)}
<D>__{meet my trigger happy partner, james west... who doesn't seem to realize that my carefully planned diversion gave me the opportunity to search for the missing scientists.}
<A>__{now west notices the half dressed bombshell in the carriage.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{scientist, huh.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{this is rita. i found her locked in a cage in loveless's bedroom. she's an entertainer.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{um, maybe i haven't been quite honest about that... my name is rita escobar. i came to find guillermo escobar, the scientist, my... father.}
<A>__{gordon's eyes pop.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{professor escobar?! he was the one i almost rescued that night when...}
<P>__{(lightbulb)}
<D>__{that's where i know you from! fat can candy's... you sang before i did.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{that was me. burgundy dress with the bustle...}
<A>__{gordon starts singing the song... west rolls his eyes, cuts off the chit chat.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{look, rita, i'm sorry you had the wrong agent working on your case. when i find your father i promise i will send him back safely...}
<A>__{and with that... west suddenly leaps over rita lands on the back of one of the horses. he grabs a handful of mane, leans over and unclips the harness. and with a kick in the ribs, west is off at a gallop leaving gordon, one remaining horse and an awed rita behind to chew his dust.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{he's impulsive, james.}
