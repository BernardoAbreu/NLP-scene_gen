<A>__{dylan has picked two wires.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{chartreuse and magenta. this has gotta be it.}
<A>__{she prepares to snip them with her wire cutters, when...}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{i wouldn't do that, if i were you.}
<A>__{she spins to see knox, standing behind her.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{see, if you snip any of those wires, the bomb will blow up.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{it's gonna blow anyway, once the clock gets to zero.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{who told you that, my idiotic henchman? do you think i tell him anything that's confidential?}
<A>__{he holds up a small triggering device. it's the same one we saw pascal try to sell in the opening scene.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{this is what triggers that bomb. so if you'll kindly step away, i will refrain from killing both of us.}
<A>__{charlie's angels 8 18 99 realizing she has no choice, dylan stands up and backs away.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{in different circumstances, dylan, i think you and i could have worked out. we have a lot in common.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{yeah, i fall for assholes, and you are one.}
<A>__{knox laughs.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{good one.}
<P>__{(beat, as he backs up)}
<D>__{well, i must be going. if you like your body parts attached to your torso, i suggest you do the same.}
<A>__{knox turns to go, but the other angels are blocking his way.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{give it up, knox. you're surrounded.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{give us the detonator.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{stumbling backwards, knox holds it up high.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{i will blow this building sky high, i swear!}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{don't do it, eric. it's me you want, not all these innocent people.}
<A>__{everyone turns, as one, to a figure emerging from the shadows.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{charlie?}
<A>__{that's right, it's charlie. finally, after all these years, we get a look at him, and boy is it... disappointing. he's not what we expected. short, portly, dressed in a "we're #1" t shirt; the angels are absolutely floored by charlie's appearance.}
<C>__{angels}
<D>__{charlie?}
<A>__{charlie ignores their stares and addresses knox directly. charlie's angels 8 18 99}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{your father was a double agent, eric. yes, i revealed him, but he was killed by his own people before we could throw him in jail.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he was my friend.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{it's still your fault, you arrogant prick! you still killed my father!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{maybe. maybe i did. but why should you kill all these people? if you hate me so much, just shoot me. just shoot me, eric.}
<A>__{charlie spreads his arms, leaving knox a plenty wide target. it's a horribly tense moment. the angels are frozen, watching knox decide charlie's fate. knox is sweating, debating his choices. can he really do this? charlie's not the glamorous, smug asshole he imagined. he starts lowering his gun.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{okay. you're right.}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i will just kill you.}
<A>__{blam! it all happens in the blink of an eye. knox fires, hitting charlie in the chest. natalie leaps out and tackles knox. alex dives and grabs the detonator, before it has a chance to go off. dylan runs to charlie's side.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{charlie, no. no!}
<A>__{she hold shim in her arms as the other angels gather round their fallen leader. he gasps for air.}
<C>__{dylan }
<D>__{he's trying to say something.}
<A>__{then dylan notices something weird. he's not gasping for air, there's something stuck in his mouth. with a great, hacking cough, he spits it out. it's a voice chip, like the one dylan used in the opening scene. charlie's angels 8 18 99}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{ucch, that tasted terrible!}
<A>__{the voice isn't charlie's. dylan reaches down and rips off charlie's mask, revealing...}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{bosley! are you okay?}
<C>__{bosley}
<D>__{think so.}
<A>__{he pulls back the padding from the suit, revealing a small wound where the bullet grazed his side.}
<C>__{bosley }
<D>__{hurts, but it looks like it'll heel.}
<A>__{dylan laughs, alex ruffles his hair.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{hey, wait a second. if bosley's here... then where's charlie?}
<A>__{the angels all look at each other. no one knows.}
