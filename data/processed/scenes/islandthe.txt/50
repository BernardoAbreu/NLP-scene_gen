<A>__{the proxy of starkweather spins over the desk. merrick regards i t with a frown. scheer sits turning the ethercuff i n his fingers with a demeanor of cool curiosity. underneath, he's rattled.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{you want to tell me what's going on?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{there's nothing going on, karl.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{i'm jaded. not stupid.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{what's your point?}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{i checked up. in the past year, three products have destabilized. all of them deltas... and there's nothing going on?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you're jumping to conclusions.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{once i can overlook. twice i can call coincidence. three times i start giving a shit. because if these products are defective...}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{q u a l i t y control is not your concern.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{s o it is a quality control issue?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{that's not what i said.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{he was in the subway tunnels for two days. in the dark, no food, no water. his fingers were scraped to the bone. he was trying to dig his way out. now you try to explain to me why that is.}
<A>__{his look says he smells a rat. merrick weighs him a moment. then sighs, a little depleted. he gets up and crosses to the glass wall. looks down on the avenue, at the agnates m i l l i n g beneath.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{it's not an exact science biogenesis. there's a degree of trial and error. if the agnate doesn't come together on the first pass, we have to abort and start over. it's like breaking inertia. the bioreactor, the growth medium we just keep upping the levels till we achieve integration. at which stage the agnate is deemed physically stable. we rely on foundation to provide mental stability matching the templates to their capacity but walling it in with parameters.}
<P>__{( b e a t , considers the proxy)}
<D>__{when signs of instability started to show up, it pointed to foundation. a hole in the wall, an oversight. but it was only happening in the later generat ions . which pointed back to biogenesis.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{so there was a production defect.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{actually the opposite. we found out in the later generations, the levels were so high that when we broke inertia, the process kept going. over integrating. specifically the neural system. it produced a condition called synesthesia.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{synesthesia...}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{a fusion of the senses, creating a component awareness. sixth sense, s e c o n d sight, whatever you want to call it. its emergence seems to be arbitrary. but it gives them experiences beyond their functional parameters. and ultimately... it destabilizes them. however, if we catch it early enough we can control it with re conditioning.}
<A>__{scheer absorbs this with a slow grin. merrick looks puzzled.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you find this amusing?}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{poetic.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{poetic?}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{this "agnate" took off just before his sponsor placed an order. maybe he got the sense his days were numbered...}
<A>__{merrick ' s composure cracks a little. he hadn't thought of this.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{this stays between you and me, karl. i trust i can rely on your cooperation?}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{don't you mean my complicity?}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(hardening again)}
<D>__{remind me, why is it you were discharged from the military?}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{what's your point?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{learn to be a team player, karl. or you'll find yourself out of another job.}
<A>__{scheer rises, discarding the ethercuff onto merrick's desk.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{nobody else would take it.}
