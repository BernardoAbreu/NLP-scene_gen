<L>__{exterior lexington avenue day}
<A>__{from a high angle, joe walks away from the apartment house, chorus continuing o.s. "... they say you are taking the sunshine that brightened our pathway a while."}
<L>__{interior everett's bar day}
<A>__{joe sits at the bar, staring morosely at his image in the mirror, already quite drunk, oblivious to the assorted types hiding from daylight in the barn like saloon, waiting for night to fall.}
<C>__{ratso's voice}
<D>__{excuse me, i'm just admiring that colossal shirt...}
<A>__{ratso studies joe across the corner of the bar a sickly, child size old man of twenty one hopefully nursing an empty beer glass, contemplating the money on the bar in front of joe.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{that is one hell of a shirt. i bet you paid a pretty price for it, am i right?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh, it ain't cheap. i mean, yeah, i'd say this was an all right shirt. don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.}
<A>__{ratso spits as jackie leans on the bar next to joe a feminine young person, heavily made up, hair teased, wearing earrings and a lace trimmed blouse over shocking pink levis.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{got a cigarette, cowboy?}
<C>__{ratso}
<P>__{(a stage whisper)}
<D>__{more goddam faggots in this town.}
<A>__{reaching for a cigarette, joe glances at jackie, startled as jackie twitches his pink levis angrily and turns away.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{shee it...}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{kee rist, you really know the ropes. wish to hell i bumped into you before. i'm joe buck from texas and i'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{enrico rizzo from the bronx. don't mind if i do.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(slaps bar)}
<D>__{same all around! for my friend, too!}
<A>__{the tv screen over the bar features a mating game program as jackie cruises down to join a tall farm boy with plucked eyebrows. the tv host points to three young men, visible only from the shoulders up, from whom a pretty date girl in blindfold must choose an escort.}
<C>__{tv host}
<D>__{... and for the losers, who don't get the girl, we'll give as consolation prices a six month supply of underarm deodorant...}
<A>__{in a booth now the tv screen in the background, continuing the game joe is refilling ratso's beer glass as he speaks, loud over the laughter of the tv audience.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{... you see what i'm getting at here? she got a penthouse up there with color tv and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when i ask for money!}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{for money.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{for money for what?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{how would i know? you gotta tell a person these things}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{a hustler? picking up trade on the street like that baby, believe me you need management.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i think you just put your finger on it, i do.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{my friend o'daniel. that's who you need. operates the biggest stable in town. in the whole goddam metropolitan area. a stud like you paying! not that i blame you a dame starts crying, i cut my heart for her...}
<C>__{jackie's voice}
<D>__{i'd call that a very minor operation...}
<A>__{ratso grabs the neck of a bottle, sliding back in the booth. joe scowls as jackie appears with the tall farm boy.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{... in fact, you just sit comfy and i will cut it out with my fingernail file. you won't even need blue cross, ratso.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{the name is rizzo.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's what i said, ratso.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{hey now, you heard him.}
<A>__{on the tv screen the date girl announces:}
<C>__{tv date girl}
<D>__{i pick number two! he's cool!}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{that's okay, joe. i'm used to these types that like to pick on cripples. sewers're full of 'em.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{may i ask one thing, cowboy? if you sit there and he sits way over there, how's he gonna get his hand into your pocket? but i'm sure he has that all figured out...}
<P>__{(to ratso)}
<D>__{good night, sweets.}
<C>__{tv host}
<D>__{may present your chosen mate!}
<A>__{the tv host pulls aside the screen which has concealed the lower half of the three young men. number two, her chosen mate, is a dwarf sitting on a high stool. the girl's spontaneous dismay starts everyone laughing hysterically, including the dwarf.}
