<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{ever since then, i just somehow knew what i needed to do to be strong. and when i'm full like i am right now i'm like, immortal! i can do stuff like this.}
<A>__{jennifer jams the cuticle stick into her own forearm and drags it through her flesh. needy screams and covers her mouth.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{no biggie. watch.}
<A>__{she pulls out the stick. the wound seals over instantly. needy gasps and touches jennifer's unmarked arm.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{that's some x men shit, right?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{what do you mean, "when you're full"?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you know. full. like full of tasty morsels.}
<A>__{needy shakes her head, not comprehending.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{forget it. you'd probably tell on me anyway. not that anyone would believe you. you always think the world is coming to an end.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{what about my mom's kia? why did you attack me out there? why were you covered in blood? you didn't even look human.}
<A>__{jennifer rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you should talk to someone about these disturbing thoughts you're having. we're all concerned. especially chip. i think he's having second thoughts about you.}

<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{come on. let me stay the night. we can play "boyfriend girlfriend" like we used to.}
<A>__{she smiles seductively. needy crawls further away from her, shivering. jennifer rolls her eyes and gets out of bed. she walks over to the second story window and cranks it open.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you said to leave. so i'm outtie }
<A>__{she climbs onto the windowsill. needy watches, confused.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{see you at school.}
<A>__{she leaps gracefully out the window. needy watches in stunned silence for a few moments. then she creeps over to the window and looks out. nothing there but the wind. jennifer's gone.}
