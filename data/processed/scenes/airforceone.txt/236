<A>__{korshunov separates marshall from his family. waves him into the com officer's chair. his hands are now wrapped too. gibbs enters looking down.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{special agent gibbs. you helped do this?}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{yes, mr. president.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{because it is my duty.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{you're duty to what? the country you served doesn't exist anymore.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{my loyalty was never to my country.}
<A>__{i serve my commanding officers.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{you don't think the leaders of the kgb would allow peristroika to ruin years of infiltration? no, when the soviet union collapsed, we took our sleepers with us.}
<A>__{korshunov holds up a telephone.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{now since we've had very little luck getting washington or moscow to cooperate, i wondered if you would be so kind.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{over my dead body.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{no. but since i only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps i will start with your family instead... gibbs.}
<A>__{gibbs grabs alice and shoves her into a chair. she fights him off, and he smacks her across the face and shoves his gun into her neck. marshall and rose struggle against their bonds.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{the world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{please. you can kill me but leave my daughter alone.}
<A>__{korshunov runs his finger down alice's cheek.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{she isn't a part of this. this is between you and me.}
<C>__{korshunov}

<A>__{marshall looks to alice, then rose, then back to alice.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{this administration does not negotiate with terrorists.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{pity. mr. gibbs.}
<A>__{gibbs withdraws his pistol. places it against alice's temple.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{perhaps a president does not negotiate, but does a father?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{an interesting choice. your daughter versus your world vision. the implicit trust of a family against your oath of office.}
<A>__{tears of fears are streaming down alice's face. she looks into her father's eyes.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{daddy...}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{alice... i...}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{and once the trigger is pulled, she is gone forever. then, i wonder, how do you live, knowing you could've saved her?}
<A>__{marshall struggles with his duty. his honor.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{and could you ever forget the look on her face as she ceases to exist... late at night, when you think about her, will stravanavitch really matter anymore?}
<A>__{marshall tries to look away, but zedeck forces him to watch.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{daddy. daddy, please...}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{jim... for godsake!}
<C>__{korshunov}

<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{korshunov smiles.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{stop.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{you'll do it?}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{yes, i will do it.}
<P>__{(broken)}
<D>__{just leave my family alone.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{good. good.}
<A>__{gibbs withdraws the gun from alice's temple. alice opens her eyes and gasps for breath.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{bring him the phone...}
<A>__{you are true to your nature, mr. president.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{someday, you'll regret my nature.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{you don't like seeing people get hurt. now in morality, that is a virtue. in politics, however, that is weakness.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you were a hostage to everyone else long before you were a hostage to}
