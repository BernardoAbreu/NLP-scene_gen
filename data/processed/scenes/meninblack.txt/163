<A>__{jay knows what he has to do. he picks up a good sized chunk of concrete dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at the bug.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{hey! come over here and try that!}
<A>__{the concrete thunks off the bug's shell he doesn't seem to notice; just keeps moving. jay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the bug.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{stop right there, or i will start wailing on your waxy, pointed ass!}
