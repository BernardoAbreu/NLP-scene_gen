<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(eyes to heaven)}
<D>__{thank q!}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oh, stop that! god! listen, i know you like me. i can tell. but you know what? a lot of guys like me. not me, exactly. it's more like the legs or the butt or the hair. or some combination of the above.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i think it's the eyes.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{the eyes. okay. an eye man. anyhow, it never works out. okay? not that you even need to know that! you look like crap, by the way. what have you been doing?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{watching television in color.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{hey, no kidding? in color?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{cross my heart and hope to die.}

<C>__{eve}
<D>__{see, ya.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{why doesn't it never work out?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{why does it never work out? you and...men?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{why?! who the hell knows?!}
<A>__{he follows closely. she stops.}
<C>__{eve }
<D>__{okay, if you promise to leave me alone, i will tell you.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{...okay.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{it never works out because i'm into legs and butts and hair myself! that's why! so i wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than i am, if you can picture that. now, if you'll excuse me, i have to go find another low paying, demeaning job where some guy named jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{why not go to work for me?}
<C>__{eve}

<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{how long would you need me?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{two weeks.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what's the pay?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what's fair?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i've got to make at least a thousand a week.}
<A>__{he gives her his patented thumbs up sign which of course is exactly like his father's.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{you got it! wait here while i change.}
<C>__{eve}
