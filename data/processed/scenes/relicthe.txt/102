<L>__{interior "alcoholics" storage night}
<A>__{slowly, making no sound, pendergast lifts the .45 anaconda, passes his finger over the cylinder, checking the loaded chambers. then he steadies the revolver and levels it at the door. the hideous pickled specimens seem to hover all around him. the smell is overwhelming and the snuffling is louder now. it's coming closer. after a long moment there is a faint bump at the door. this is followed by a low scratching noise... pendergast watches frozen in horror, holding his breath. the doorknob begins to turn! not knowing what else to do, pendergast simply grabs it from the inside and holds on! outside he hears an amused snort, then a low growl. there's one hard hit and the door shivers. the doorknob falls off! it's over now. pendergast kneels down, bracing the gun in both hands. from this position he can see right through the hole where the doorknob fell. his mouth literally drops in astonishment as he sees... a huge, red rimmed, green eye! involuntarily pendergast leaps back, nearly falls and drops the gun! beakers crash around him. he scrambles in the darkness. the flashlight falls and pops back on. the beam streaks up crazily. it's chaos. pendergast is an easy target now. he grabs for the light, the gun, steadies himself, breathing fast and low. his heart pounds. but nothing more happens. the silence is heavy. the eye is gone. and suddenly pendergast understands. in the distance he can hear human voices and a rolling wheelchair! somewhere nearby are margo and frock! the monster has left him to get bigger game. fear for margo and frock lights pendergast's eyes. all panic and disorganization are gone. he holds his revolver at 12 o'clock and kicks the door open, leaps out as a huge dark shape darts from the room. it's headed for the secure storage areas again! pendergast takes off. not knowing how else to address this thing he finds himself calling...}
