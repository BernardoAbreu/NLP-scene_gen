<D>__{this is the story of my older brother's strange criminal behavior and disappearance. we who loved him no longer speak of wade. it's as if he never existed. by telling his story like this, as his brother, i separate myself from his family and those who loved him. everything of importance that is, everything that gives rise to the telling of this story occurred during a single deer hunting season in a small town in upstate new hampshire where wade was raised and so was i. one night something changed and my relation to wade's story was different from what it had been since childhood. i mark this change by wade's tone of voice during a phone call two nights after halloween. something i had not heard before. let us imagine that around eight o'clock on halloween eve, speeding past toby's, route 29, comes a pale green eight year old ford fairlane with a police bubble on top. a square faced man wearing a trooper's cap is driving the vehicle. beside him sits a child, a little girl with a plastic tiger mask covering her face. the man is driving fast }
