<L>__{exterior the imperial gardens vienna day 1780's}
<A>__{salieri stands waiting, hat in hand. beside him stands a royal servant. behind him, gardeners are glimpsed tending the shrubs and bushes along a grassy ride. down this ride are seen cantering two people on horseback: the emperor joseph and his niece, the princess elizabeth. they are mounted on glossy horses. the princess rides side saddle. running beside her is a panting groom. the emperor rides elegantly; his niece, a dumpy little hapsburg girl of sixteen, like a sack of potatoes. as they draw level with salieri they stop, and the groom holds the head of the princess' horse. salieri bows respectfully.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{good morning, court composer. this is my niece, the princess elizabeth.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{your highness.}
<A>__{out of breath, the princess nods nervously.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{she has asked me to advise her on a suitable musical instructor. i think i've come up with an excellent idea.}
<A>__{he smiles at salieri.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{oh, your majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{i'm thinking about herr mozart. what is your view?}
<A>__{salieri's face falls, almost imperceptibly.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{an interesting idea, majesty. but }
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{you already commissioned an opera from mozart.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{and the result satisfies.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{yes, of course. my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{ah ha. favouritism. but i so want mozart.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i'm sure there is a way, majesty. some kind of a little contest. i could perhaps put together a small committee, and i could see to it naturally that it will select according to your majesty's wishes.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{you please me, court composer. a very clever idea.}
<C>__{salieri}
<P>__{(bowing)}
<D>__{sire.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{well. there it is.}
<A>__{he rides on. the groom releases her horse's head, and runs on after the princess.}
