<L>__{exterior mills' apartment building, rooftop night}
<A>__{somerset stands at the edge, holding the photo of mrs. gold. he puffs on a cigarette, looks out at the city lights.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{it's like he's preaching.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{the sins were used in medieval sermons. there were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, as a learning tool. the sins distract man from true worship. true faith.}
<A>__{mills is seated at the table with art books open. a breeze fans the pages of the books. the flipping pages reveal views of heaven, hell, adoration, crucifixion and sin.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{like in these paintings, and in dante's purgatory, right? but, in purgatory, dante and his buddy climb that big mountain...}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{seven terraces of purgation.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{anyway... pride comes first, not gluttony. and in all the paintings, the sins are in a different order. i can't find a pattern.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{because there's creativity in the mix. consider these books as the murderer's inspiration. or aspiration.}
<A>__{somerset drops his cigarette to the empty street, watching the glowing tip fall. he looks at the woman's circled eyes.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{he sees himself contributing to the body of christian work.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{he's punishing these people.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{for all of us to see and learn from. these murders are like forced attrition.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{what? forced what?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{attrition. when you regret your sins, but not because you love god.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{because someone's holding a gun on you.}
<A>__{somerset thinks. he walks from the edge to mills.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{when mr. gold's wife found the body, about how long was she in the apartment?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{she didn't find it. the door to the apartment was open and a neighbor...}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i thought you said she found the body. when she got back from a business trip.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{no. she got back after you and i had already been there.}
<A>__{somerset thinks, coming up with something.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{somerset holds up the photo of mrs. gold.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{maybe she is supposed to see something... she just hasn't had a chance to see it yet.}
