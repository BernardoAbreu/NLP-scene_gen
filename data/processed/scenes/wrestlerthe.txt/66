<D>__{a lot better than before the bypass.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{great. so i'm all good.}
<A>__{from the doctor's face, it's not quite that simple.}
<C>__{dr. tarachandani}
<D>__{your heart... you're going to have to start taking much better care of it.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{like...}
<C>__{dr. tarachandani}
<D>__{for starters, you must take your medication every day.}

<D>__{it's all over your blood work.}
<C>__{randy}
<P>__{(sheepish, busted)}
<D>__{maybe once in a while.}
<C>__{dr. tarachandani}
<D>__{well, it has to be never.}
<A>__{randy gives him a reluctant nod.}
<C>__{dr. tarachandani }
<D>__{as for exercise, it's still okay, as long as it's moderate.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{so, like, wrestling...}
<C>__{dr. tarachandani}
<D>__{not a good idea.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{what if i do it moderate? i could hold back on certain moves. there's always ways to fake }

<D>__{mr. ramovic...}
<C>__{randy}
<P>__{(edgy glare)}
<D>__{randy.}
<C>__{dr. tarachandani}
<D>__{randy, a man with your heart should not be flying around a ring crashing into people.}

<P>__{(reads name tag, mispronouncing)}
<D>__{...trachanani, i'd like a second opinion on that.}

<A>__{randy lets out a skeptical, sarcastic snort.}
<C>__{dr. tarachandani }
<D>__{you almost died. the next time, you won't be so lucky.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i want a second opinion.}
