<L>__{exterior pacific day}
<A>__{a life raft is tossed on dark, storm driven seas. inside it, semi conscious, chuck hangs on.}

<L>__{exterior beach early morning}
<A>__{the storm has ended. waves lap gently on a beach cut like a scallop out of a rocky shore. on the beach we see scattered fedex boxes. and we see, face down, half buried in sand, a man in a suit and a life jacket. chuck. the tide gently rocks him, laps at his face. he chokes. slowly he gets to his knees. vomits seawater, big heaves. he rolls over, sits down. dazed. still confused. where am i? what happened? chuck's first instinct is to check the time. he looks at his watch, taps it in frustration. then he looks around, and we look with him. chuck's pov beach the fog has thinned. we can see palm groves and mangrove thickets leading back into a thickly wooded valley climbing up a steep, rocky hillside. the rocks on the opposite point end in a barren ridge. clouds hide the top of the hill.}

<A>__{as he takes in his surroundings. he licks his lips. he's thirsty. but something he sees is even more important. we stay with him as he walks. he comes to a fedex package in the sand, picks it up, brushes off the sand, walks farther. he picks up another package.}
