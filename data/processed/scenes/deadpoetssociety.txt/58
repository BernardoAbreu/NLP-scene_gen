<L>__{exterior campus night}
<A>__{neil is walking by with the notes for the play when he notices todd sitting off by himself on one of the walkways.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{todd? hey.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{nothing. today's my birthday.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{is today your birthday? happy birthday.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{what's you get?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{my parents gave me this.}
<A>__{neil looks down at a deskset sitting next to todd, still in its wrappings.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{isn't this the same desk set }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yeah, yeah. they gave me the same thing as last year.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{neil}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{maybe they thought you needed another one.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{maybe they weren't thinking about anything at all. uh, the funny thing is about this is i, i didn't even like it the first time.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{todd, i think you're underestimating the value of this desk set.}
<A>__{neil picks up the desk set and begins examining it more closely.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{i mean, who would want a football or a baseball, or }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{or a car.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{or a car if they could have a desk set as wonderful as this one? i mean, if, if i were ever going to buy a, a desk set twice, i would probably buy this one both times. in fact, its, its shape is, it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? i can feel it. this desk set wants to fly.}
<A>__{neil tosses the desk set lightly in the air. todd stands up and neil hands him the desk set.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{todd? the world's first unmanned flying desk set.}
<A>__{todd flings the desk set over the side of the walkway and it falls to pieces down below.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{oh, my!}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{well, i wouldn't worry. you'll get another one next year.}
