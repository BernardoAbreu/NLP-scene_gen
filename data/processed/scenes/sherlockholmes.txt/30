<L>__{19 interior pentonville prison blackwood's cell night}
<A>__{blackwood sits dead center in the dark. eyes closed, whispering ungodly sounds. on the walls the scrawls of a madman: wild symbols, sketches of animals, a headless sphinx, an upside down cross. a hint of some method to his madness.}
<C>__{guard captain}
<D>__{all right, blackwood, what's this all about?}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{i've a request.}
<C>__{guard captain}
<D>__{you don't get nothin' `til you stop this devil nonsense. that's a holy book }
<A>__{blackwood closes his eyes again, resumes his soft murmur.}
<C>__{guard captain}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{ and you will respect it!}
<A>__{blackwood starts whispering faster. louder.}
<C>__{guard captain}
<D>__{boy, you want me to muzzle you }
<A>__{suddenly, the captain starts coughing. he's confused. he coughs harder. prisoners watch him stumble backwards. blackwood keeps whispering. the captain falls to one knee, keeps coughing. finally the captain coughs something up, spits it out onto the stone floor. he looks down, horrified: it's a small catholic cross on a chain. prisoners start shouting. the raven at blackwood's windowsill flutters away. other guards run up, terrified.}
<D>__{guard #2 get him to the infirmary, now!}
<A>__{guards pull the captain away. the remaining guard picks up the cross, stares at blackwood, chilled. blackwood's eyes snap open.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{i've a request.}
