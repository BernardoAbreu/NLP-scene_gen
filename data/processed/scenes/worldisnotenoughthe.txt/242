<T>__{her pov:}
<A>__{big, battered and bloody, valentin zukovsky is leaving a boat, moving over the rocks toward the entrance with three of his men. two bodies in his trail. he's on course for elektra and nothing is going to stop him, even as his henchmen are cut down by ferocious fire.}
<L>__{interior maiden's tower bosphorus day}
<A>__{elektra moves to her gun. just then, gabor crashes through a stained glass window, neck broken. two elektra henchmen appear from below stairs as the doors burst open. zukovsky stands there. a bloody giant. they open up with machine guns, but two shots from zukovsky take them out, though he takes one in the shoulder. right now, he's unstoppable. a shocked silence after the shooting. he eyes bond in the chair. to the room:}
<C>__{zukovsky}
<D>__{i'm looking for a submarine. it's big and black, and the driver is a friend of mine.}
<A>__{then his eye falls on the hat renard had brought up from below. he knows at once what it means.}
<C>__{zukovsky}
<D>__{bring it to me.}
<A>__{she picks it up, walks to him (surreptitiously sliding a gun beneath it). she proffers the hat...}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{what a shame. you just missed him.}
<A>__{blam blam blam she fires through the hat. he staggers back. stares. slumps down. lowers his head to the ground. she walks over, puts her heel on his gun arm, presses down, smiling a half psychotic smile. the gun is pinned. zukovsky is dying. but he dredges up every last ounce of energy to raise his gun a millimetre off the ground, his outstretched arm already pointing at bond. elektra looks surprised, then amused as zukovsky's finger begins to squeeze the trigger: he's going to shoot bond! bond stares back. zukovsky's eye narrows trying for extreme accuracy... blam! the shot hits the binding at bond's wrist. splinters the wood there. elektra stares at zukovsky. she didn't see where the bullet went, just that it missed bond. she watches his head slump further, staring at bond... a look passes between the two men. comrades in arms. the merest of smiles. then the light fades from his eyes. dead.}
<B>__{elektra}
<A>__{turns back to bond. smiles.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{she picks up a walkie talkie, speaks into it:}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{everything's under control up here. are you ready?}
<C>__{renard}
<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{yes. au revoir...}
<A>__{lost for a moment, she breathes heavily. she glances at zukovsky's corpse. slightly puzzled, to bond:}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{zukovsky really hated you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{time to say goodnight.}
<A>__{and she kisses him reaches behind to deliver the killer twist... one super fast movement: bond's hand breaks free, grabs her throat, tight. he holds her, their faces close together, disdain in his eyes hurls her backwards, her hand scratching at his face. ripping the collar from his neck, he gets to his feet. moves to zukovsky, checks his pulse, takes the bloody gun from his fingers. turns back, to see elektra disappearing upstairs. a moment's dilemma: should he race below to the sub or up to elektra? he takes off after elektra, grabs the radio handset.}
