<L>__{interior cafe day}
<A>__{the restaurant is nothing fancy. a little dark. helen makes her way to a booth in the back. sitting in the shadows, facing the door, is simon. she sits down opposite him. he doesn't smile or kiss her in greeting, but glances around the room like he expects a threat to leap out at any moment.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{are you sure you weren't followed?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i kept looking back, like you taught me. i didn't see anyone.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{okay. it's just, things are a bit hot for me right now. if i get a signal...}
<P>__{(holds up a cigarette lighter meaningfully)}
<D>__{i may have to leave suddenly.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{it's my job to risk my life, but not yours. i feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one i can trust.}
<A>__{simon creates an atmosphere of danger. his haggardness give him an air of mystery and desperation.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{where were you? on a... uh, mission?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{ssshhh! we say op. covert operation. and this one got a little rough.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{worse than cairo?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{cairo was a day at the beach next to this.}
