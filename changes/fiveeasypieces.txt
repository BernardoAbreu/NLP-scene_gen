<ACTION>__{BACH-VIVALDI OVER: A 7-year-old BOBBY sits in a chair, his feet dangling in absent-minded rhythm to a chamber piece played by his father, his two brothers and his sister. CLOSE ON a metronome, marking a slow etude rhythm. The CAMERA MOVES from it to Bobby, on the piano bench beside his mother. As she patiently demonstrates the etude for him, he places a thumb in his mouth and leans against her arm. ON THE METRONOME at an andante rhythm. CARL and TITA, now in their teens, are seated side by side on the piano bench, playing four-hands with dazzling virtuosity. The CAMERA MOVES from them to a framed newspaper article on the music-room wall.
