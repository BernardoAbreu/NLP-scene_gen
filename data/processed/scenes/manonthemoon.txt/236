<T>__{slow dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior funeral home day}
<A>__{andy lies in peace in a casket. he has died. his expression is pleasantly bland. almost latka like. but his face is caked with so much funeral home makeup, it almost looks like a mask. we slowly widen. the casket is surrounded by beautiful flowers. we tilt up... and high above... is a movie screen. on the screen is a projection of andy, silently staring at us. there's a gentle smile on his face. it's the image from the opening of this film. andy's pov: the chapel is filled with grieving mourners. all are in black. everyone's quiet, in a state of shock. andy's family is huddled. lynne sits alone in a pew, crying. george gives zmuda a hug. little wendy comes over... and they comfort each other. everyone who ever knew andy is there: taxi cast, fridays cast, tm followers, hookers, jerry lawler, ed weinberger, maynard smith, budd friedman, it goes on and on... and they all have odd discombobulated expressions. they stare up at the projected andy.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{well... my show is over. i did my best, and i just want to say, until we meet again... please remember:}
<P>__{(he begins to sing)}
<D>__{"in this friendly, friendly world... with each day so full of joy. why should any heart be lonely."}
<A>__{some gathered people tentatively join in the singing.}
<D>__{andy (on film) (cont'd) so everybody! put your arm around the person next to you, even if you don't like that person. come on!}
<P>__{(he resumes singing)}
<D>__{"the world is such a wonderful place, to wander through, when you've got someone to love, to wander along with you. with the sky so full of stars, and the river so full of songs, every heart should be so thankful, thankful for this friendly, friendly world..."}
<A>__{the curtain behind the coffin opens and the casket with andy's body slowly slides into the darkness. the curtain closes. the film ends. and all goes silent. some people cry. some begin to leave. most of them are just staying, numbed. george and zmuda whisper.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's a perfect kaufman audience.}
<C>__{zmuda}
<D>__{yeah. they don't know whether to be sad, or angry.}
<A>__{the taxi cast are flustered.}
<C>__{carol kane}
<D>__{why are people leaving? the curtain's gonna open. andy's gonna come out... i know it!}
<C>__{tony danza}
<D>__{sure, the body was just made of wax...!}
<P>__{(a very long beat)}
<D>__{wasn't it......?}
<A>__{silence. they look to the front. the closed curtain wafts... then settles motionless.}
