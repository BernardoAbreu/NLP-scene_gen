<A>__{the saw finishes cutting the bolt between marcus' legs; his arms are already free. the buzzing cuts out, but now they hear the chopper landing directly overhead.}

<D>__{they're already here for you }
<A>__{marcus slides the bolts out of his legs, freeing himself from the chains.}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{hide in the forest, then aim west for open country }
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i'm heading across the river.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{no human being can survive there }

<A>__{blair studies him a moment, no changing his mind. but she admires him. she starts up the ladder, marcus following. barnes is still passed out as blair and marcus ascend to the platform around the pit. they move to the sliding door blair starts to open it, but sees a light and hears voices and footsteps at the far end, slides it shut again.}

<D>__{damn it, we're too late }
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{where's that go?}
<A>__{marcus points to a large ventilation fan behind steel grating, eight feet above them, on the far side of the pit. it's not running, but there's no way to get through it.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{should lead out, but there's no way past the fan }
<A>__{marcus is already picking up the rpg but he points it backwards, has no idea how to shoot it blair grins, grabs the rpg from him then braces herself, takes aim and fires kaboom! the explosion rips open the grate, destroys the fan.}
