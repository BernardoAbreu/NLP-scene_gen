<D>__{who is it?}
<A>__{a knock again. graham sets his book down and goes to the door. he unlocks the deadbolt and opens it. ann stands in the hallway. graham is obviously flushed with feeling at seeing her. she wordlessly moves into the room, her movements like a slow breeze, her expression calm. graham watches her go by. she stops in the middle of the room, her back to him. graham moves toward her slowly. sensing him behind her, her breathing becomes deep. graham slowly enfolds her in his arms, his face against her hair. she closes her eyes as their fingers entwine.}
