<A>__{there's a sudden loud, brittle pop from somewhere overhead, and phil's gloved hand, hovering over a computer screen, is punctured through and through. the screen itself is holed and spiderwebbed with a loud crack!}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{uhhh!}
<B>__{phil holds up his hand}
<A>__{as he and terri stare at it, dumbfounded. thick droplets of blood leak out and begin to swirl away, sucked up towards the venting puncture in the hull over head. the astronauts' helmets dangle up there, awaiting use.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{what in god's }
<A>__{suddenly we hear high pitched alarms sounding, then the pinging of more tiny missiles, slashing across the ship's outer skin.}
<B>__{woody and mcconnell}
<A>__{are staring back from the cockpit, reacting in astonishment to phil's drifting blood and to the alarms. then woody suddenly understands.}

<C>__{terri}
<D>__{woody, seal the breech!}
<B>__{angle on woody}
<A>__{as he unbuckles, dives from the cockpit back down into the eva, and floats quickly over to a storage hatch. he yanks this open pulling out a}

<A>__{then spins around in zero g, as his eyes track}
<B>__{the rising droplets of blood}
<A>__{which give a telltale hint of the puncture's location, somewhere up among the dangling helmets on the "ceiling."}
<B>__{woody pushes off}
<A>__{rising to this area, and shoves aside a helmet with a shattered faceplate its label reads "mcconnell" to reveal a breech in the hull. jagged metal edges, dangling insulation. the blood droplets are whirling out through here, going into the vacuum of space. quickly woody stuffs the muzzle of the patch gun into the puncture, firing a thick grey sealant. we hear more pings, echoing loudly, but after a few seconds they diminish, then abruptly stop. the klaxons continue to wail.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{kill those alarms!}
<A>__{mcconnell punches buttons, muting the alarms, and they all strain to listen, faces tense and sweating. a long beat. but the meteor shower has passed by, as abruptly as it appeared. the astronauts turn, becoming aware of a strange phenomenon. phil's blood droplets have stopped in place, wobbling eerily as perfect spheres in the zero g. then suddenly they start moving again, faster and faster, in a new direction. down through the open core tunnel that leads to the lower hab.}
<B>__{mcconnell}
<A>__{stares at a gauge that confirms what's happening.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{still outgassing in the lower hab! there must be another hole down there, even bigger.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{losing pressure fast! we're gonna decompress!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{computer, how long until zero atmosphere?}
<C>__{computer}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{four minutes, nine seconds.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{if we get below 20% atmosphere, the power will shut down!}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{positive! a vacuum inside the ship would cause a total electrical failure. the nav computers will fry!}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<P>__{(to woody)}
<D>__{we'll lose all control. we won't be able to fire the engines to capture mars orbit.}
<A>__{just then a computer screen flickers, freezes. phil punches keys with his good hand. what he sees shocks him.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{it's already starting. the primary l 1 hub has been smashed. the systems are crashing.}
<A>__{woody looks back at his crew, struggling to project more calm than he really feels.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{everybody switch to suit oxygen. we beat this in the simulator, we can do it here. jim, you've got the ship. i'm going eva.}
<A>__{they stare at him, stunned by their immense task.}

<D>__{c'mon, people, let's go! let's work the problem!}
