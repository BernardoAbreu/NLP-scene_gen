<L>__{interior von doom conference room night}
<A>__{from their vantage point, they see the missile explode. flames dance. sue's eyes darken, as doom grips her neck. reed tries desperately to move, but he is frozen. it takes every last ounce of strength to lift one finger, which makes a craccckkkking sound.}
<C>__{doom}
<D>__{one more down. now it's just the scientist and his specimen.}
<A>__{sue and reed lock eyes. reed tries to move his mouth. he has something to tell her, struggling just to move his lips and get the words out.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{sue. the only thing i ever knew without thinking was...}
<P>__{(his lips fully freezing)}
<D>__{i...love...}
<A>__{he starts to say "you," but his lips freeze, mid word. sue whispers to him:}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{me too, reed.}
<A>__{doom steps toward sue, about to deliver the final blow.}
<C>__{doom}
<P>__{(quiet, cruel)}
<D>__{and so four became none. it's my time now.}
<A>__{boooom! an elevator door flies into the room! smash!}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{actually, vic...}
<A>__{reed recognizes the voice. so do we. doom turns to see... ben grimm, aka the thing. back in rocky, fighting form.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's clobbering time!}
<A>__{doom turns, just as bam! ben hits doom harder than any living thing has ever been hit. the force sends doom back through the air, toward the far wall, where he smashes into the massive "v" sculpture. it snaps, crashing onto him. a few sparks. then nothing. nothing at all. no more movement. doom is dead. ben turns to reed.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{damn, i've been wanting to do that.}
<A>__{reed manages the thinnest smile as ben starts disconnecting the tubes from reed.}
<C>__{ben }
<P>__{(reed's words)}
<D>__{victor's "not that bad," huh? just "a little larger than life"? maybe you'll listen to me next time before }
<A>__{whmm! the wreckage shifts. they turn to see...doom emerges. he stands, power coursing. and he charges at ben! ben charges back. and these two behemoths... slam into each other, crashing through glass, into thin air!!}
