<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior road to calais night}
<A>__{an overturned wagon lies in the ditch. beer kegs litter the roadway. the wagon's driver, an old farmer, sits on one of the kegs, holding his head. d'artagnan and the musketeers gallop into view, rein their horses to a stop.}
<C>__{farmer}
<P>__{(with relief)}
<D>__{thank god for a friendly face. my horse broke loose. can you help me move these kegs out of the road?}
<A>__{d'artagnan starts to dismount.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{stay on your horse.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{he needs our help.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{don't worry. we'll help him.}
<A>__{suddenly: two other men step before the wagon, pointing muskets. the ragged farmer reaches inside his coat, pulls out a pistol, makes a smirking request:}
<C>__{farmer}
<D>__{won't you step down... musketeers?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{gentlemen, i beg you. please put away your weapons and remove these kegs from the road. we'd prefer to ride on without having to kill you.}
<A>__{d'artagnan and the "farmers" gape at aramis in surprise.}
<C>__{farmer}
<D>__{you're threatening us?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{it's not a threat, it's a fact. if you don't haul those kegs away, you're dead where you stand.}
<A>__{the farmer laughs, contemptuously. he raises his pistol and aims it at porthos' head. but before he can pull the trigger, three explosions erupt from under the cloaks of athos, porthos and aramis. when the smoke clears, d'artagnan is startled to see the three dead "farmers" sprawled in the road and the three pistols emerging from beneath the cloaks of the musketeers.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{mine hit the ground first.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{mine was taller.}
<A>__{aramis swings out of the saddle and begins to perform last rites over the bodies. d'artagnan still can't believe what just happened. he turns to porthos. porthos raises the barrel to his lips and blows away the gunsmoke.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{there's only one rule, d'artagnan stay alive.}
<A>__{thunder rumbles and rains begins to fall.}
