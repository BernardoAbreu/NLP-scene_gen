<L>__{214. in the great cabin}
<A>__{jack has taken his jacket off and is already unfurling his charts. stephen hurries in.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{have you forgotten your promise?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{subject to the requirements of the service, stephen. i could not in all conscience delay for the sake of an iguano or a... giant peccary interesting no doubt, but of no immediate application.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{how can you dismiss, out of hand, the bounty of nature? knowledge that... that will help to progress...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i can see nothing on shore that will progress our mission.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{but how can we possibly know what lies on these islands, perhaps some knowledge that may save life, that...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i will tell you how to save lives stephen. inform me how to guide this ship, undetected, under the nose of a 40 gun frigate. that is the job in hand sir.}
<A>__{stephen swallows his indignation and tries for a compromise.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{well perhaps there's an opportunity to serve both our objectives. as i understand it you mean to go round the end of this long island, then start your voyage. i could walk across it, be on the other side long before...}
<A>__{jack shakes his head.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{i would walk briskly, pausing only for important measurements and almost certainly making valuable discoveries...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{if wind and tide had been against us i should have said yes. they are not and i am obliged to say no.}
<P>__{(with finality)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{stephen is livid. betrayed.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i see. so after all this time in your service i must simply be content to form part of this belligerent expedition, hurry past inestimable wonders, bent solely on destruction...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{...you forget yourself, sir.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{no jack, you have forgotten your self. you once believed in the rights of each individual man no matter how useless or lowly. but it seems to me now that the long exercise of power has brought you to the point where even a solemn promise...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the promise was conditional.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{...a promise to a friend of ten years standing who has stood by you and supported you....}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i command a king's ship, not a private yacht...}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{...across half the worlds oceans often at risk to his own life}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{...and we have no time for your damned hobbies, sir!}
<A>__{"hobbies". so that is jack's honest view of stephen's lifetime of work in science. he bows slightly, then leaves.}
