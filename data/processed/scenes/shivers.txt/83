<L>__{interior swimming pool night}
<A>__{between the two towers lies the swimming pool. st. luc manages to reach the door leading from the south tower into the pool. he hangs on to the door of the pool itself for a moment in near exhaustion, then opens it and enters. the pool is dim and tranquil. two women are swimming in the deep end as though nothing were at all abnormal. st. luc watches them for a moment, enjoying the apparent normalcy of the scene. then he staggers forward, calling out to the swimmers.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{have you seen the police? i'm dr. st. luc. have you seen the police? have they come?}
<A>__{the swimmers both flick playfully beneath the water's surface. st. luc approaches the water's edge, waiting for them to surface. the water ripples and bubbles near his feet. a sinking feeling comes over him. he watches in horrible fascination. he begins to shiver. the ripples and bubbles spread and intensify. after a pause, janine surfaces, smiling radiantly. a few seconds later, betts surfaces near her, the very picture of benign, watery calm. betts gestures to st. luc to join them in the pool. st. luc shakes his head slowly, backing away from the pool. he turns to leave the room. as he turns, mr. spergazzi appears out of the shadows behind him. using his four pronged aluminum cane, he pushes st. luc backwards into the pool, chuckling playfully. spergazzi looks around for approval as st. luc begins to thrash about wildly. betts swims up beside st. luc, grabs him, and holds him under.}

<D>__{a kiss!}

<D>__{give him a kiss. give him a kiss.}
<C>__{various residents}
<P>__{(voices echoing in unison)}
<D>__{a kiss, a kiss, a kiss!}
<A>__{betts allows st. luc to rise to the surface as a laughing janine splashes over to him and fastens her mouth to his. as they kiss, janine's hands hold st. luc's head fiercely. betts assists her by pinning st. luc's arms behind him. janine's throat ripples and swells, her cheeks billow as a parasite swarms upwards from deep within her body. st. luc's cheeks now swell as the parasite enters his mouth. his eyes jolt open in terror and he manages to pull away slightly, revealing the tentacles joining her mouth to his like grappling irons. st. luc twists out of betts' grasp. he and janine, still locked together, sink beneath the surface. dozens of residents pour into the pool room and join spergazzi and the others at the poolside. among these are faces already familiar to us: kurt, kresimir and benda, the old laundry room woman, etc. the new spectators clap, laugh, croon, and moan as though witnessing a wild group baptism. some of them throw themselves into the water, pulling others in with them. deep under the water's surface, st. luc still struggles to free himself from janine. residents now splash into the depths all around them. st. luc's cheeks bulge wide and blood dribbles from his nose and mouth. his throat swells monstrously. janine releases him just in time for us to see the end of a tentacle slip back into his mouth. he exhales heavily as parasite enzymes pump furiously through his body. the water boils with his exhaled breath. janine and st. luc drift apart, now completely calm, as residents splash and swim, kick and embrace.}
