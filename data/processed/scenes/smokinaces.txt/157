<L>__{interior bathroom day}
<A>__{light switch flipped on, revealing the shrunken, shriveled, fetal like form that is hollis elmore being carried by margie turlock, 63, part time rn, full time souvenir shop owner. a substantial, tank of a woman, margie manhandles elmore, dropping him into a lukewarm bath, brimming with grey water.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{okay sweetie, now i'm a registered nurse and this was my bath not a half hour ago, so it ain't as hot as it could be, but we're gonna get you all toasty warm in no time }
<P>__{(beat, to boy)}
<D>__{warren, warren go on an' get grandma her hot blanket and her heating bag, the one in there under the sink in my bathroom.}
<A>__{warren sniffs, licks lovingly on an ice cream sandwich, but never bites it.}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{slower nana. talk slooooooeerrrrr.}
<A>__{margie indulges her grandson, no end.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{okay shug...grandma needs you to go in }
<A>__{ warren begins to smile, a snarl of misshapen yellow teeth, smeared with chocolate, bracketed by chrome colored braces.}
<D>__{margie (contd) (cont'd) oh, you little foxy, trying to fool your nana! you heard me didn't you!? margie (contd) (cont'd)}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now boogie, grandma needs her big helper boy now, go on an' get those things and grandma'll rub your feet!}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{my karate feet? my crazy karate kick feet!!}
<A>__{warren puts the ice cream sandwich in his mouth and begins hopping up and down, kicking, striking the wall with great, disturbing ferocity. margie cackles at this.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{you little angel butt! grandma'll rub those feet forever!}
<A>__{elmore, struggling against imminent death, watching this display with increasing dread. he scans the sink basin sees it lined with anti depressants; ritalin, thorazine, etc warren keeps throwing hard roundhouse kicks into the wall.}
<C>__{margie }
<D>__{oh you silly sil! never mind, grandma'll get it!}
<A>__{margie marches off and warren immediately rushes over to the tub, placing himself directly over the inert elmore and assuming a martial arts stance. he opens his mouth to speak and the ice cream sandwich tumbles out, landing in the tub.}
<C>__{warren}
<P>__{(barking out)}
<D>__{bow to your opponent!}
<A>__{warren bows before he squares up and begins methodically delivering a "kata" of punches and kicks...violently and expertly snapped within millimeters of elmore's face. elmore, helpless to raise his arms or defend himself, stares in horror as the boy, his glasses beginning to fog and drip with perspiration, works himself into a furious lather.}
<C>__{elmore}
<P>__{(trying to speak)}
<D>__{pl kid, st stop...}
<A>__{elmore holds up his stump of a hand, pinky wagging in pathetic plea no use warren is in a state of unhinged, near animal frenzy his eyes wild, a small, yet prominent erection beginning to poke through his karate gee... margie returns to the bathroom, scolds her grandson. he squares up on her, feigning a blow to her face. she clouts him, hard backhand, big flabby arms restraining him, hauling him out of the bathroom. he bleats like a butchered sheep. elmore, left alone, stark naked, shaking he turns his head, gazing into the other room a newscast plays on the television: a reporter, lakeside, via live feed...standing in the same parking lot where deeks and dupree were killed.}
