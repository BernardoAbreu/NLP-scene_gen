<L>__{interior hallways night}
<A>__{st. luc half drags, half carries forsythe along hallways whose doors are wide open. from the apartments issues the entire catalogue of suggestive sexual sounds giggles, moans, groans, cries, whispers, shrieks. we catch glimpses of people of all kinds and ages locked together on floors, chairs, etc. st. luc finds an open exit door and plunges through it, taking forsythe with him.}
<L>__{interior gym night}
<A>__{the door to the gym opens and st. luc looks in cautiously. the gym is quite tiny and is deserted. st. luc pulls forsythe in and closes the door. he lays forsythe down on a gym mat and then barricades the door with a box horse and a weight lifting table. he kneels beside forsythe, who seems to be only just regaining consciousness. st. luc strokes her face, pushes strands of hair matted with blood out of her eyes.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<P>__{(more to himself than forsythe)}
<D>__{rollo'll be here soon. rollo'll be here soon.}
