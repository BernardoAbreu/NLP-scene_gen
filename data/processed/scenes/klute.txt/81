<L>__{interior theatre: reading scene day}
<A>__{a wide shot. an open casting call in an off broadway theatre. darkness, except for the work light onstage. a small group there onstage including the figure of bree. just offstage, the figures of director (jang) and a producer. and the rest of the theatre, the audience section, dotted with the heads of actors, actresses waiting for their turns. bree's voice rings out across the gloom.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{ why?}
<A>__{closer, onstage the others stand rigid as statues, facing dead front an experimental drama, clearly all holding scripts, as bree hastens from one to another, fiercely, imploringly }
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{why please, why? why lose, why look? why hate and give and want and love? why get, grieve, g }
<C>__{jang}
<P>__{(loudly, cheerfully)}
<D>__{thank you very much.}
<A>__{all break posture, start offstage, while bree, caught in mid stride, clowns it a little.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{ gug gug }
<A>__{ then toward jang, a bit succinctly, indicating script }
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{why? i want to know what.}
<C>__{jang}
<P>__{(laughs tolerantly)}
<D>__{no, that was very good everybody. do we have all your resumes?}
<C>__{producer}
<P>__{(from list)}
<D>__{booth osman zuff anjeris chaka.}
<A>__{wider, near stage front. bree shrugs, steps down off stage with the others. bree finds jang's hand out for her script, smiles wanly, turns it over, continues on out of scene. she finds something someone impeding her way. looks up.}
<B>__{past bree to klute}
<A>__{klute has edged out into the aisle to intercept her.}
