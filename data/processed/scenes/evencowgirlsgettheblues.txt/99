<D>__{you've got two minutes to come out with you hands over your heads!}
<A>__{random g men are sniping at the cowgirls, making it impossible to surrender. a stray bullet sends the chink back down the hillside, beard, robe and sandals flying. in the hush that follows, in the echoes of the explosive fire, the whooping crane flock rises in one grand assault of beating feathers a lily white storm of life, a gush of albino gabriels swarm into the waiting sky, and circle the pond one time before flapping south toward texas... ...they cast shadows over a dead jellybean who is literally biting the dust. sissy lifts jelly out of the dust and holds her. sissy lifts jelly's satin shirt tail and pulls down the waistband of her skirt. bright red blood is running out of her scar.}
