<L>__{exterior green house day}
<A>__{quoyle pulls up beside the ancestral home. agnis stands at the back of a rented truck, sorting through materials in the payload. across a stretch of ground, bunny is earnestly pretend reading a book to warren, who lies listlessly before her. quoyle comes up behind agnis. he carries a newspaper and an excited air.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{listen to this. 'well, we see the postman has landed in jail for 45 days for throwing the mail in killick claw harbor. he said he had too much to deliver, and folks could just take a dip and help themselves.'}
<A>__{he looks up, eager for her reaction. she is still sorting through bolts of thick cloth, spools of heavy thread, odd mechanical devices.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{this is great stuff. 'a snowmobile mishap has taken the life of 78 year old rick puff, who was on his way home from what the widow puff calls a 'screech in and a carouse,' when his machine fell through the ice. a well known accordion player, mr. puff had served four years in the 1970s for sexual assault on his daughters. bet they aren't crying, either.' this billy pretty can really write!}
<C>__{agnis }
<D>__{...passes as colorful.}
<A>__{he looks into the truck. sees all the stuff. she surveys his puzzlement.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{nephew, we can't fix up the house proper on a journalist's wages. so i have un retired.}
<A>__{oh. absorbs that.}

<D>__{from what?}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{upholstery. been sought after for 33 years, wherever i've lived. this should be the real test, huh?}
<A>__{quoyle nods. could be that. the sudden sound of footsteps above them, makes him look up sharply, to see... ...a fit young man in a toolbelt climbing down a ladder from the roof. the muscles of a stud, the shy smile of a boy, he waves a greeting and hops down the last six feet to the ground.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{this is dennis buggit, master carpenter.}
<A>__{dennis offers a hand, and a smile that says he's expecting to like you. makes the sentiment contagious.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{only til i get my lobster license. i'm a fisherman in my soul.}
<A>__{a strong handshake. on both sides.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{it's a newfie thing, the compulsion to fish. y'hear yesterday's tragedy 'bout the newfie who went ice fishin'?}
<A>__{quoyle hasn't.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{brought home 200 pounds of ice. his wife fried it. they both drowned.}
<A>__{quoyle laughs good and honest. dennis likes that.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{with me workin', we'll need day care for bunny after school. turns out dennis and his wife send their little girl to this wonderful saintly woman. how's that for us livin' a charmed life?}
<A>__{quoyle nods, if a bit cautious. dennis squints out across the bay.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{agnis says yer buyin' a boat. sooner's prob'ly better'n lat...}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{i'm not buyin'. no boat.}
<A>__{sounds pretty sure of that. punctures the amiable ambiance with a shard of silence.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{well, course we're buy...}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{buggit, huh? any kin to my boss on the gammy bird?}
<A>__{the silence. just got thunderous. a full beat.}

<A>__{even the eyes glance down. what is that? in the wake of it...}
<C>__{agnis }
<D>__{gonna chat up yer daughter, or just ignore her as usual?}
<A>__{quoyle nods. better do that. dennis sends a shy smile, as if apologizing for the awkwardness. quoyle holds up a finger, be right back, and... ...heads on over to where bunny is reading to warren.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{warren threw up in your sleeping bag. she's got a stomach problem.}
<A>__{quoyle takes a breath to answer, but stops. he's caught a whiff.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{headline. dog fart fells freelance reporter. promising career nipped in bud.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{it's called cancer.}
<A>__{oh. quoyle holds his face together, as bunny strokes the limp warren. then, he crouches down... ...strokes warren, too. good dog.}
