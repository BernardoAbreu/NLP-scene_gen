<A>__{and six other patrician, white business people of louisville in their green baize and wood paneled luxo boardroom. they speak soundlessly and patronizingly to cassius clay, sr., seated at the foot of the table. it relates to the stack of contracts in front of him. he is in a suit and tie, his hair and moustache are dapper. his tie's a little loud. he has his hands folded deferentially in front of him.}

<A>__{we get the impression that, if he doesn't understand what he's being told, he's faking it. he is conforming, delivering socially mandated deference... frontal: cassius, sr. and beyond him, seated against the wall, is cassius, jr. in sport jacket and tie. right now he looks to his left and to the right, and only then do we notice the entire wall he's against is covered with pictures of thoroughbreds and studs this louisville sponsoring group owns as well. he is one among their sporting possessions. he doesn't like it. he looks at the back of his father listening.}
