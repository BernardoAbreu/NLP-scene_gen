<L>__{exterior plains country med. shot moving late afternoon}
<A>__{the camera frames and moves with the lone horseman. he is ethan edwards, a man as hard as the country he is crossing. ethan is in his forties, with a three day stubble of beard. dust is caked in the lines of his face and powders his clothing. he wears a long confederate overcoat, torn at one pocket, patched and clumsily stitched at the elbows. his trousers are a faded blue with an off color stripe down the legs where once there had been the yellow stripes of the yankee cavalry. his saddle is mexican and across it he carries a folded serape in place of the texas poncho... rider and horse have come a long way. the camera holds and pans the rider past and we see another detail; strapped onto his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray silk sash wrapped around it... horse and rider pass, moving closer to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come tearing around the corner of the house.}
