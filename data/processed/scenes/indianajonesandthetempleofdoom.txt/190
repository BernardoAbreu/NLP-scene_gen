<L>__{162. interior the tunnel}
<A>__{indiana is crouched in the back of the zooming mine bar blasting away with the pistol he captured in the quarry. a gunman in the car behind returns his fire, the explosions lighting up the tunnle walls. indy aims and fires again the gunman is hit and knocked back in the car. another guard with a khyber rifle moves up to the front and starts firing. meanwhile, as the car goes into a hard turn, short round rides the brake beneath the car we see the brake pad scraping on the metal wheel. the tunnel gets lower and indy has to duck under each beam flying over and can only pop up to fire between the low beams. the rifleman in the car behind is relading. then he lifts his rifle indy pops up simultaneously and shoots! the gunman is hit, his rifle flies up and his head smashes against the beam hurtling above! screaming horribly, the gunman is knocked from the speeding car like a broken doll.}
