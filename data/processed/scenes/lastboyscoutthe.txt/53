<T>__{time cut to:}
<A>__{three sticks of dynamite one minute later have been taped to the car's ignition system. hallenbeck removes the taped bundle. holds it up for inspection.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{we'll hand this over to the cops. they can analyze it.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{great. so what now?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{you tell me, kid.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{give up? flee? go really far away?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i got a better idea. let's check in with my family.}
<A>__{they start walking toward hallenbeck's plymouth. hallenbeck tosses the car keys to jimmy.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i'm tired. you drive.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{sure. family, huh? you got kids?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{yeah. little girl.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{does she like you?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{not much, no. and she likes prince, so go figure.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i like prince.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{great, you can marry my daughter. or better yet, fuck my wife. i hear all it takes is a credit card and two valid i.d.'s.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{open the trunk.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(indicating bomb)}
<D>__{you're just gonna stick that in your trunk?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{you're right. let's leave it here for the neighborhood kids to play with.}
<A>__{jimmy opens the trunk. as he does, however, a voice rings out suddenly from the darkness.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{hold it right there, gentlemen.}
<A>__{they stop. slowly they turn.}
<B>__{two men}
<A>__{are approaching from out of the trees. one holds a flashlight trained on hallenbeck and jimmy. the other carries a silenced beretta.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{is it the cops?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{no, jimmy. it's not the cops.}
<A>__{working quickly, hallenbeck tapes the bomb to the inside of the truck lid. slams it shut. turns, facing the new arrivals. the men wear tailored suits with matching ties. one is tall and lean. the other is a bruiser, short and stout. they both have the seasoned look of professional mob hitters. the taller man speaks, gun held rock steady.}
<C>__{tall man}
<D>__{good evening, gentlemen. bit late for a stroll, don't you think?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{yeah, you two better be getting home.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{the streetlights are on.}
<C>__{tall man}
<D>__{that's amusing. how delightful to find such amusing men so late at night.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't believe i've had the pleasure.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{no, i don't believe you have.}
<P>__{(to jimmy)}
<D>__{he'd like to have the pleasure.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{tell him it's not for sale.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{he says it's }
<C>__{short man}
<D>__{what's your name, fuckface?}
<A>__{this from the shorter man, who is clearly not happy.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{i'm asshole. he's fuckface.}
<C>__{tall man}
<D>__{jake, apprise rodney dangerfield here of his situation.}
<A>__{jake slips on a pair of brass knuckles. steps up and delivers a looping right to hallenbeck's face. a sickening crunch. a two inch gash streams blood. jake relieves hallenbeck of his gun.}
<C>__{tall man}
<D>__{perhaps we can dispense with the fun and games now, yes?}
<A>__{jimmy rushes forward, snarling. the beretta swivels. jimmy stops, the gun aimed at his gut.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{easy... jim... all they want is the evidence...}
<C>__{tall man}
<D>__{the evidence. very smart. see, jake, he knows when a situation is untenable.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you like that word?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{great word.}
<C>__{tall man}
<D>__{it occurs to me that you may have the evidence in question.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(spits out blood)}
<D>__{give up, jimmy. we're dealing with geniuses.}
<A>__{another fist to the head. hallenbeck grunts. spits more blood.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{leave him alone, you fuck!}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{back off, jimmy.}
<A>__{the tall man turns and eyes jimmy.}
<C>__{tall man}
<D>__{leave him alone...?}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{whatever you say. jake?}
<A>__{the short man steps away from hallenbeck. turns and launches a kick at jimmy's groin. connects. the kid drops to the ground, retching.}
<C>__{tall man}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{ah, my young friend... i neglected to tell you that jake attacks his job with a certain... exuberance.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{christ... i'm being beat up by the inventor of scrabble.}
<C>__{tall man}
<D>__{he's still in a good mood, jake. kick him again.}
<A>__{jake steps forward.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{hallenbeck speaks through cracked, bloody lips:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you want the fucking evidence that the stripper had. i've got it. so we can play games, or i can hand it over.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{and then you'll let us go, right?}
<C>__{tall man}
<D>__{sure. we'll let you go.}
<P>__{(to hallenbeck)}
<D>__{where is it?}
<A>__{hallenbeck meets the tall man's gaze. speaks softly.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{hand me the car keys, jimmy.}
<A>__{jimmy stumbles to his feet. looks at the tall man.}
<C>__{tall man}
<D>__{walk over and hand him the keys. slow and easy.}
<A>__{jimmy takes out the car keys. crosses to hallenbeck. gives him the keys.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{the evidence is in the trunk.}
<C>__{tall man}
<D>__{open it. slow.}
<A>__{hallenbeck smiles. shakes his head.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{he turns and throws the keys as far as he can. they fall out of sight behind a cottage.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{oops. i guess nobody gets it.}
<C>__{tall man}
<D>__{you dumb bastard, you're going to pay for that. jake, open the trunk.}
<A>__{jake steps forward, drawing a .38 silenced pistol. he is going to shoot open the lock.}
<B>__{angle on hallenbeck}
<A>__{this is what he's been waiting for. he tenses, looking to one side: next to him is a sloping hillside, angling down and away. he grips jimmy's wrist, signalling to get ready. jake raises the pistol. take aim at the lock and fires. the shot is silenced. what follows is not. because the bullet blows through the trunk and hits three sticks of live dynamite.}
<B>__{series of shots}
<A>__{hallenbeck is already moving, pitching to one side, throwing himself and jimmy down the hillside. the night lights up like a sunburst. a tower of fire... climbs up and outward from the car. the trunk lid is blown fifty feet in the air. the tires are pulped. glass sprays for fifty yards in every direction. and, most importantly: both hitmen are engulfed in flame. sound. fury. flames, rolling skyward. tinkle of raining glass. bits of falling metal. all in all, a helluva blast, and meanwhile:}
<B>__{jimmy and joe}
<A>__{continue to careen down the hillside. bouncing like rag puppets. out of control. lurch to stop at the bottom. covered head to toe with dirt. bruised. bloody. alive. they lie side by side, sucking air until they both hear an odd noise: the sound of crumpling metal. the sound is getting louder. they both crane their necks in time to see the flaming car, tumbling end over end coming down the hill. heading straight for them.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{jesus fucking christ!}
<A>__{they both dive for cover, out of the way. barely make it. the car plows past them in a shower of dirt. crumpling. heaving. spitting fire. finally slams to a halt against a palm tree. burns. the night is filled with shouts and curses. the sound of doors opening. the crackle of flames.}
<B>__{on ground}
<A>__{joe rolls over. looks at jimmy. jimmy looks at joe.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you alive?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{don't know yet.}
<A>__{they crawl to their feet, inspecting for broken bones.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{the dynamite?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{either that, or we're looking at a major factory recall.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{dead guys... don't make bad jokes, right?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{so we're alive.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{yeah. hooray.}
<A>__{he spits blood as sirens once more fill the night air,}
<B>__{approaching.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{go. get out of here.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{get the fuck out of here, i will take the heat on this one. rent a car. then go home and wait for my call. do it.}
<A>__{jimmy meets joe's eyes. nods. dashes off into the night.}
