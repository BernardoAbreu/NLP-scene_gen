<A>__{she opens her mouth and emits a jet stream of bile. close shot ash as he's drenched in the face. linda begins to laugh at him in a wild, high pitched squeal. he gains control of himself and steadies the saw.}

<A>__{he brings down the spinning blade. and moves past the camera and towards the head. we are left looking at the wall of the work shed upon which we see the stark shadow of the ghastly deed. we hear the sound of spinning steel meeting bone and the screams of a demon. close shot light bulb as it is splattered with blood. medium shot ash ash stumbles back into frame and falls against the wall, now lit in crimson. he looks at the off screen carnage in terror. he begins to shake as though in shock. he trembles as he looks down at his hands; they are covered in linda's blood. he wipes his hands on his pants and shirt, trying to rid himself of it, but only succeeds in painting himself with the stuff. ash screams a wild scream of fear and despair. it echoes off into the night. crane shot exterior work shed night ash in a confused state as he staggers from the work shed and towards the cabin. again clutching the chainsaw.}
