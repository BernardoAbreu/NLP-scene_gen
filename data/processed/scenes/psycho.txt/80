<A>__{from a raised angle, we see norman bend down and begin to wrap the shower curtain around the body. we see the edges of the curtain as they are raised and laid down again. then he picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body in the trunk. he closes the lid then, but does not lock it. he comes back into the cabin, closes the door completely, flicks on the light. again the newspaper is in the foreground. for a moment he pauses, closes his eyes against the realization of what he is doing, then quickly pushes all thoughts away, continues with his work. with the room lighted, he now proceeds to gather up all mary's articles and toss them into the suitcase. he checks all drawers and the closet, gets down and checks under bed and bureau, goes into the bathroom, checks that room again, comes back into the bedroom, looks about carefully, spots mary's handbag, throws even that into the suitcase, is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl are gone from the room. then he closes mary's suitcase, picks it up. with his free hand he picks up the pail, in which are the mop and the used towels. he crosses to the door, switches off the light with his shoulder, pulls open the door, starts out.}
