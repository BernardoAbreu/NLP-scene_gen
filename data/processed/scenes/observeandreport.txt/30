<L>__{interior mall night}
<A>__{the lights are off and a gloved hand breaks into a case in the jewelry store. all of the diamonds and gold are picked up and pocketed. someone is robbing this bitch.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior mall the next morning}
<A>__{ronnie strolls through the mall sipping on his morning coffee. he stops when he sees that the jewelry store has been broken into and robbed.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<A>__{ronnie goes running down through the mall.}
<L>__{interior mall security office morning}
<A>__{dennis and ronnie are sitting and mark stands over them. they're looking at the security tapes. detective harrison knocks on the door and walks in. ronnie stands up to greet him.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{good to see you, brother. looks like the old team is getting together to crack one more case.}
<A>__{ronnie gives detective harrison a hug.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm ready to go to war with you.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{thanks for waking me up this morning, ronnie.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i've already checked the security tapes. they didn't catch a thing. someone must have broken in here and turned them off.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{my team just checked all the doors and there are no signs of forced entry. i've also checked out the crime scene, but we didn't see any fingerprints on the glass. the suspect was probably wearing gloves.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that doesn't sound good. how did they do it?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{laser technology.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{my guess it was an inside job. probably someone who has access to keys like a janitor or a security guard.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{detective harrison, can i ask you how long you've been a detective for?}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{i'm almost at the end of my first year.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{just as i thought, a rookie.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{i've been a police officer for several years.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, you're a rookie, okay. it's fine, you'll learn with experience. and when you do, you'll discover that rule #1 of law enforcement is that you don't ever turn on a fellow officer. now, i know you would never actually accuse somebody on my security force of committing this act of lawlessness.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{whoever did this would have to had keys to the security room so they could shut off the camera.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{look, my record speaks for itself and as for dennis, well i can certainly vouch for him. dennis is one of the finest men i know, so just take my word, you're barking up the wrong tree. now, let's put this little squabble behind us and get back to busting the guys that robbed this mall.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{ronnie, nobody is accusing anybody, but i would like to stick around for a while and interview some of the employees.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{okay, but all i ask is that you do it quietly, so that the hoopla is kept to a minimum.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i understand too, sir.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{ronnie, you are to leave detective harrison alone and let him handle the investigation.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no can do, mark. when you appointed me head of mall security, i swore an oath to protect this mall and aid in bringing crime to its knees.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you didn't swear an oath.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{to myself i did.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{ronnie, on these types of investigations, it's usually not a good idea to have too many cooks in the kitchen.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{there's only one cook. i'm a chef. a cook and chef, together, serving up justice.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{i'm gonna do this alone.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{hot plates of justice.}
<A>__{ronnie stands up.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{come on, rookie. let me show you the lay of the land.}
