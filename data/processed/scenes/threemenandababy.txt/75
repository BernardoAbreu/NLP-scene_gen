<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{the cops are leaving.}
<D>__{agent #1 well, there's obviously been a mistake. as far as you're concerned this investigation is closed. we apologize again.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(big smile)}
<D>__{oh, don't mention it! it was a pleasure having you here! i hope you'll find what you're looking for very soon! agent #1}
<P>__{(looking straight at him)}
<D>__{so do we.}
<A>__{michael closes the door and races into the living room where he discovers peter putting on his jacket.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{did you hear that? he said there'd been a mistake and they weren't going to bother us anymore.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{bullshit, it's a trick.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you think so? really?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{they just said that to put us off guard. they saw the condition this apartment's in.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{they know the punks were here looking for the dope and that they probably didn't find it. so that means we've still got it.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{but he said the investigation was closed.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{okay, let's just see how closed it is. i will go downstairs. you watch out the window and see if i'm being tailed.}
