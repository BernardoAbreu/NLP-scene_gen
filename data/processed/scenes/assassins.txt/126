<A>__{rath checks his watch. it's after eight o'clock. he lifts the phone and plugs it into the modem.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i'm going to call.}
<A>__{electra drops her book and climbs off the bed. he dials, types the code and waits.}
<D>__{contractor screen hello, robert. rath screen the contract? contractor screen paid in full.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{oh, my god. ten million dollars. contractor screen transferred to the specified account.}
<A>__{rath stares at the screen.}
<D>__{contractor screen goodbye, robert.}
<A>__{rath disconnects. the phone hums. electra picks it up, placing it back in the cradle.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{sit down.}
<A>__{she does. he opens a case and pulls out his gun, some paper and pens and two small mikes that look like hearing aids.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{okay }
<A>__{he starts drawing several squares on the paper, as electra picks up the mike. she looks over it, frowns.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{two way?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{transmits and receives.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{cheap as shit.}
<A>__{he looks at her.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i paid a lot for these.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{they saw you coming a mile away. if i had known we'd be using }
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{it's too late now. okay? we'll have to deal with these.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{he goes back to his drawing.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{this is the bank. this is the hotel. in the morning i will enter the bank.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{check.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{he will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd. he'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{but he won't shoot you right then?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no. it would be amateur. a risk. he'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming. once i'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. he'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.}
<A>__{he draws another square.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you'll be here. a restaurant. a public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{okay. then what?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{then, we wait.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{aiiee. more waiting? i don't know if i like this plan.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{it will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself. he will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow i slipped by and am already on a plane to europe.}
<A>__{he describes this as though remembering it.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{the sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed. 5:45. 5:50. he will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why won't he wait until the bank closes?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{he won't be able to. he'll have to go inside. he'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not i am there. if the bank closes, he won't know for sure. he'll come. i'm sure. and when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{what? what if he brings it with him?}
<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{he can't. the bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and x ray machines.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{that means you won't have a gun.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{and with the mikes, i will tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{if things go well, i don't have to. you'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you'll have the money. how do i know that you won't }
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i will be walking out of the bank, unarmed. you'll have the gun and i will drive the car.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{we split the money?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{five million apiece. you get on your plane, i get on mine.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{sounds pretty well figured out.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i've been thinking about it for a long time.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{except }
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i told you, he will.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you can't know for sure, how can you? i mean, you're not him.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i was.}
<A>__{she waits for him to explain.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{ten years ago, i sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting }
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{for nicholai?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you killed him here? in this city, outside that bank?}
<A>__{rath nods.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{what is it? i don't like this at all. what is going on here?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i don't know. it just happened. i was here ten years ago, i'm here now. that's it.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i don't believe that.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{it wasn't planned or premeditated. i swear. things happened beyond my control. i understood; i saw where they were leading and i suppose that it just made sense.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{ten years ago.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i waited until i was insane and then i walked into the bank. he was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{what did he want?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{he wanted what i want now; to get out of the business. to disappear to some empty greek island.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{he said i couldn't win. that no one wins at this game.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{was that it?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you didn't take it.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no. i went back to the hotel. and waited.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{ten years later, here you are again.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes. here i am again.}
