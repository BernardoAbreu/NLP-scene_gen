<L>__{interior provincial arena dugout tunnels day}
<A>__{maximus is marching relentlessly through the dugout and cramped, serpentine trench like tunnels that lead to the arena. we don't really see maximus well in the dark tunnels. proximo scurries to keep up with him they brush past gladiators who line the walls. some are wounded, some are being attended to by surgeons, some are shell shocked, some are nervously waiting to go on, whispering prayers. we twist and turn in the tunnels with proximo and maximus as:}
<C>__{proximo}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i've wagered on you against the celts ignore the others and go for them there are two axe and net and two long spear. now the celts aren't used to the sun so you have the advantage there...}
<A>__{the roar of the crowd is growing, they are nearing the arena...}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{and keep them moving, their lungs aren't strong, ground the spears as soon as you can and then go for the ax men. if you get all four there's an extra bonus so don't be distracted by the spartans...}
<A>__{without a word to proximo, or a moment's hesitation, maximus strides into the arena.}
