<L>__{interior 'bubble' test facility kazakhstan day}
<A>__{(christmas jones') pov: the sound of breathing loud, we're looking from inside the visor of a protective suit. it's hard to tell what's going on, but our hands are removing a sphere of cobalt blue plutonium from inside a corroding warhead...}
<L>__{exterior facility same}
<A>__{an officer eyes bond's pass.}
<C>__{colonel akakievich}
<P>__{(subtitles)}
<D>__{you are late. the transport documents?}

<C>__{colonel akakievich}
<P>__{(subtitles)}
<D>__{they are waiting for you below. it should be ready. check with the ida physicist.}
<A>__{he points toward the "bubble." inside the transparent bubble, a protective suited figure finishes placing a blue plutonium core into a box. as bond and the colonel walks toward the bubble, the figure steps out, still enveloped in the white protective suit. moving fast, off comes the helmet to reveal a beautiful american girl. christmas jones is mid twenties, shortish hair, hot right now. in one movement she unzips and steps out of the suit, revealing a khaki sports bra, cut off shorts, heavy duty boots. a nasty looking hunting knife strapped around her hips. she has a deep tan and an incredible figure. she grabs a bottle of water, guzzles. bond tosses an arched brow to akakievich, who nods bitterly, also unable to take his eyes off her. he spits on the floor and speaks in english, so christmas can hear.}
<C>__{colonel akakievich}
<D>__{not interested in men. take my word for it.}
<A>__{akakievich isn't exactly what you'd call a looker. bond offers a disappointed tut as akakievich walks away. christmas approaches. he notices her ida tag and an incongruous peace tattoo just above her hip. she's checking him out as well.}

<D>__{couldn't make it. splitting headache.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{the soldiers may give you a hard time. whatever. if we weren't around, they'd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.}
<A>__{bond looks at the ominous radiation warning signs.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{will i need protection?}
<A>__{she squints at him, taken aback.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{there's no radiation danger down there.}
