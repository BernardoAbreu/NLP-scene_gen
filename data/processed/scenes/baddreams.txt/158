<L>__{exterior country road day}
<A>__{a new station wagon whisks along the pretty road.}
<L>__{interior station wagon day}
<A>__{alan drives, cynthia looks at a map. they both look relaxed. they both have bandaged hands.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{go right if that's the interstate. yeah, it is.}
<L>__{exterior unity house day}
<A>__{through the greenery are the charred and overgrown remains of unity house. a chiseled sign embedded into a tree verifies it. alan and cynthia pull up, park. cynthia gets out and looks around. she goes to the front entrance. alan follows her in.}
<L>__{interior front room day}
<A>__{a mere skeleton of what it was. daylight pours in through the faded, burnt slats of wood. patches of woods have sprouted up. cynthia wanders in and marvels at it all. only piles of charcoal signify where furniture was. alan meanders in from the other and of the house.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{victorian. looks like it was a nice house once.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yes. i guess appearances can be deceiving.}
<A>__{she moves out upstairs. he follows her up onto the risky looking steps.}
<B>__{on the landing}
<A>__{she reaches a point at the top that looks out over the meadow and pond. she looks out. alan joins her. cynthia takes in the view contentedly.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{it's dead. it's really dead...}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{she gestures to the house around them.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{it's over.}
<A>__{alan smiles. he pulls her close to him. they look into each other's eyes. neither of them is completely at ease with the other, but there is honest affection. they hug, then kiss.}
