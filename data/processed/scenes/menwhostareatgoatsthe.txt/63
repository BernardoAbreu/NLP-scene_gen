<L>__{exterior desert road day back of truck}
<A>__{as the truck bumps off down the road, bob and lyn sit down and find themselves facing two young iraqi men.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{hi! hello there. thanks so much for this.}
<A>__{the two young men smile in a friendly fashion.}
<C>__{bob }
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{don't know if we would have lasted much longer. phew!}
<A>__{one of the young men nods, smiling. he reaches casually forward and takes lyn's bag from him. lyn just sits there, resigned as the young man roots through the contents.}
<C>__{bob }
<P>__{(oblivious)}
<D>__{yeah, it gets pretty hot out here, huh?}
<A>__{the young man takes out a rock compilation cd from lyn's bag and inspects it.}
<C>__{young iraqi}
<P>__{(to the other)}
<D>__{deep purple.}
<A>__{they laugh.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(laughing too)}
<D>__{oh, you speak english? great. deep purple. right. you guys like deep purple? you like rock or, or...}
<A>__{he suddenly notices the young iraqi is holding a handgun. the driver leans out the window and shouts something over the roar of the engine. the young man next to lyn takes off his scarf and starts to blindfold lyn with it.}
<C>__{bob }
<P>__{(smile fading)}
<D>__{lyn? is this...is this...?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{yeah.}
