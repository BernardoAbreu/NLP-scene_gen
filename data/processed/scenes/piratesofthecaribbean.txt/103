<L>__{exterior islet beach later night}
<A>__{the middle of the night. a fire blazes. jack and elizabeth are roaring drunk, arm in arm, singing the song all the way up to the stars }
<D>__{jack elizabeth yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!}
<A>__{yo ho, yo ho, it's a pirates life for me!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i love this song!}
<P>__{(sings)}
<D>__{yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me! we're beggars and blighters, ne'er do well cads, drink up me hearties, yo ho!}
<P>__{(gives it a touch of irish ballad)}
<D>__{aye but we're loved by our mums and our dads. drink up me hearties, yo ho!}
<A>__{they hoist their bottles, but only jack drinks. he drains the bottle, then tosses it away.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{when i get the black pearl back, i'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the spanish main.}
<A>__{elizabeth salutes the idea with her bottle. jack doesn't have a bottle to salute back. she hands him hers. he drinks, then settles shakily to the ground. elizabeth sits beside him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{not just the spanish main. the whole ocean. .. the whole world. wherever we want to go, we go. that's what a ship is, you know. not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails. that's what a ship need_ ... but what a ship is what the black pearl really is ... is freedom.}
<A>__{elizabeth lays her head on his shoulder.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ah, well... the company is better than last time. and the scenery has definitely improved.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(coy)}
<D>__{mr. sparrow! i'm not sure i've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.}
<A>__{elizabeth shrugs with a sleight but promising smile. she picks up the empty bottle from the ground, holds it up.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{to freedom.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{to the black pearl.}
<A>__{they tap the bottles together. elizabeth feigns a drink as he chugs. he taps his bottle against her again. she laughs, feigns another drink }
