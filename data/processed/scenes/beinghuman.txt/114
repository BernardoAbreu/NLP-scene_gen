<L>__{exterior camp night}
<A>__{dom paulo and the priest and some of the officers are having a more formal meal at dom paulo's table outside his shelter. an argument is in progress between dom paulo and gaspar dias, the navigator. gasper dias has drawn a rough map which lies on the table.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{can't you be more accurate?}
<A>__{hector comes to the meeting. he sits down on a box near the table and watches and listens, his expression changing with the shifts in mood of the others. this is hector the social animal, our hector with his pockets full of stolen nails and his tent full of stashes of food.}
<C>__{dias}
<D>__{how can i be accurate without instruments? as it is i'm sighting the sun with two pieces of wood... call it five hundred and be done with it... he said twenty rivers.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{we just want you to be as accurate as we know you can be, dias. after all, the ship did manage to find that rock with admirable precision.}
<C>__{dias}
<D>__{confound you, dom paulo, that's an insult... she hit that rock because she was taking water and unsteerable... she was overloaded before she left india and you know it....}
<A>__{dias pounds his fist on the table.}
<C>__{dias}
<D>__{i've told you... we vote for a leader or you can walk into the jungle on your own... it should have been done days ago...}
<C>__{da cunha}
<D>__{calm down, dias... you can't stay here forever, living on turtles' eggs...}
<A>__{there are mock groans and laughter at the thought of it. the tension for the moment is broken.}
<C>__{da cunha}
<D>__{what about the sick and the injured, dom paulo...?}
<A>__{dom paulo lets out a heavy sigh.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{i've discussed it with father diogo... i don't see how a hundred of us can carry seventy sick...}
<C>__{father diogo}
<D>__{i'm going to search the scriptures tonight. i'm sure that god has an answer to it.}
<C>__{dias}
<D>__{an excuse, you mean... we'll be leaving them here to die...}
<C>__{salgado}
<D>__{oh, so you're coming with us now, dias!}
<A>__{dias mumbles to himself.}
<C>__{dias}
<D>__{after the vote...}
<C>__{father diogo}
<D>__{it might be the best we can offer them now... the chance to die a good christian death here, and set an example to the heathens...}
