<L>__{interior organ loft day}
<A>__{pan along a gigantic serpentine stack of wedding presents. nearly twelve feet high, the pile curves along the balcony, high above the diners in the great room, extending al the way to... ... an organ loft. alone, above the noise of the party, julianne and kimmy have just reached the top of the staircase. trapped between ten tons of lavish gifts and the keyboard of the mammoth organ. dwarfed by their surroundings, kimmy draws the hardest breath of her life...}

<D>__{so. what did he say?}
<A>__{julianne's eyes move over the young girl's face.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{he said. marry me.}
<A>__{kimmy yelps in her ecstasy, flinging herself against julianne, and they go down full length across the organ's pedals, blasting the room with a monster chord of china rattling volume and horrifying disharmony. as grown men and women scream in spontaneous terror below, kimmy begins to... ... laugh. and kiss and hug her new sister. and holds her tight.}
