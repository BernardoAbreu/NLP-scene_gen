<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{ester crawford is on the stand. she is a black woman in her thirties thin and tired looking, although we get the impression she once was pretty. she is dressed in what is obviously her sunday dress. cardenas questions her.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{mrs. crawford, you were mr. marsh's maid for nine years?}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{did miss lawson and mr. marsh ever argue?}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{like cats and dogs.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what did they argue about?}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{you name it they argued about it. mr. marsh tried his best to keep her happy but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{did they argue the day before he died?}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{well he died on a sunday and i have the weekends off but they were ripping at each other with both barrels friday afternoon.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what was the nature of the argument?}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{sex.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{could you be more specific?}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{she was calling mr. marsh an old man making discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities. she said that she had needs and that if he couldn't fulfill them she'd find someone who could.}
<A>__{dulaney jots down a note. cardenas continues.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{did you ever see mr. marsh use cocaine?}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{no never.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<P>__{(to dulaney)}
<D>__{your witness.}
<A>__{cardenas sits down. dulaney approaches ester with a smile.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{did you go to college, mrs. crawford?}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{high school?}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{your honor, i fail to see what mrs crawford's educational background has to do with this case.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i was just about to make my point, your honor.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{do it quickly, mr. dulaney.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(reading from note pad)}
<D>__{"discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities." who told you to say that?}
<A>__{ester doesn't answer, but her eyes drift past dulaney and focus on troxell. dulaney follows her stare.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{did mr. troxell help you with that phrase?}
<A>__{troxell and cardenas squirm a little.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{i heard him say it.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{then those are not your own words?}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{what else did the district attorney's office tell you to say?}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{objection, your honor. the fact that mrs. crawford heard mr. troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(to cardenas)}
<D>__{i'm just curious to see if mr. troxell reconstructed anything else.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{your honor please!}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{i will see both of you in my chambers. right now.}
