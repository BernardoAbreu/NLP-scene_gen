<L>__{interior hannah's apartment thanksgiving night}
<A>__{a large, perfectly roasted turkey on a serving plate briefly fills the screen as the camera moves across the food laden table in hannah's kitchen, past an electric mixer, several bowls, spices, tomatoes, and parsley, to reveal evan walking through the doorway.}

<P>__{(holding a drink)}
<D>__{i want ice! who's got some }
<P>__{(pointing to an ice bucket on the table)}
<D>__{oh, there it is.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{it's on the table, dad.}
<A>__{the sounds of thanksgiving guests in the other room are dimly heard; "you made me love you" continues softly in the background. mavis passes the table, licking some food off her hand. hannah, in the background, is busy by the stove.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(putting ice into his glass)}
<D>__{hey, where's holly? she's late.}
<A>__{as mavis leaves the kitchen, lee enters, carrying some empty glasses.}

<P>__{(walking briskly to the sink)}
<D>__{hey, hannah, did you read that last thing holly wrote? it was great. she's really developed.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(offscreen, in another area of the kitchen)}
<D>__{i know, she...she really writes good dialogue.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(turning to the offscreen hannah)}
<D>__{yeah. i will get some ice.}
<A>__{lee walks off, drying her wet hands in the air. hannah, in a silk dress, moves onscreen, going to the table and pouring herself a glass of wine as norma enters the kitchen.}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{hannah, can i tell everybody you're going to play desdemona?}
<A>__{norma walks over to a glass doored cabinet and takes out a bottle of gin.}

<D>__{oh, mom, it's only television.}
<P>__{(beginning to mash}
<D>__{some sweet potatoes}
<P>__{in a bowl on the table)}
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(gesturing with the bottle)}
<D>__{yes, but it's public television. and to me, shakespeare doesn't get any greater than othello. you with some big black stud! i love it!}

<P>__{(overlapping, reacting)}
<D>__{oh, honey!}
<A>__{the movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between the dining room and the living room. upbeat jazz plays over the low din of the party. two women stand by the partially set dining room table, chatting and arranging some plates, as elliot strolls into view, sipping a drink. he passes the women and walks through the doorway into the living room, nodding hello to a guest who is walking the other way. he enters the living room, smiling. it is crowded with guests; hannah's children play in their midst. one of hannah's boys grabs elliot's arm. they playfully "spar" for a moment before elliot laughingly shakes him off, continuing on his way into a connecting room. he stops at the doorway, looking at the crowd. the camera shows his point of view: guests stand in clusters, enjoying themselves; one woman chats with a little boy; another woman, carrying a drink, walks over to a group of other guests. the film then cuts back briefly to elliot, holding his drink and looking straight ahead, as it shows his point of view once more. this time he sees a smiling lee and doug, talking animatedly; a few guests are seen in the background. elliot's voice is heard over a close up of the couple.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{oh, lee, you are something.}
<A>__{lee and doug kiss each other. they continue talking.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{you look very beautiful. marriage agrees with you. everything that happened between us}
<P>__{(pausing)}
<D>__{seems more and more hazy.}
<A>__{as lee takes a sip of her drink, the movie cuts back to elliot, standing in the doorway and still staring straight ahead. the camera moves in closer to his face as he talks over the scene.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{i acted like such a fool. i don't know what came over me. that complete conviction that i couldn't live without you.}
<A>__{the film quickly cuts to a brief look at lee and doug, still talking animatedly and smiling. lee gently pushes back doug's hair.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{what did i put us both through? and hannah...}
<A>__{the camera moves back to elliot.}
<C>__{elliot }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...who as you once said, i love much more than i realized.}
<A>__{after pausing for a moment on elliot's face, the film cuts to the foyer, where two boys and a girl gather by the door. one boy opens it, revealing holly. she joyfully enters the apartment, greeting each child with an enthusiastic kiss.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(kissing the children)}
<D>__{hi! how are you!}
<P>__{(kissing)}
<D>__{happy thanksgiving!}

<D>__{i didn't miss dinner, did i?}
<C>__{children}
<P>__{(overlapping, talking at once)}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{the jazz ends as the record scratches and stops. evan's rendition of "isn't it romantic" is heard on the piano as holly, shrugging the strap of her pocketbook off her shoulder, walks towards the living room. she is stopped by three guests two women, one of them wearing glasses, and a man who are coming out of the room.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(smiling)}

<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(hugging the man)}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{the movie cuts to hannah, leaning contentedly against a doorway into the living room and listening to the offscreen evan play the piano. elliot, holding his drink, walks over to her. they look at each other for a beat; elliot then hugs hannah, pulling her towards him. she leans her head on his shoulder, fingering his jacket lapel. they look offscreen together, happily, intimately, at the offscreen guests, as the camera moves across the room, past a few guests, to reveal evan sitting at the piano. norma sits at his side, one arm resting on the piano. she holds a drink and looks off in the distance, mouthing the words to "isn't it romantic." the camera then moves to the doorway in the living room, where a man, holding a drink, enters and joins the happy crowd. evan can be seen in the background, playing his song. a child plays near the coffee table. the camera continues to move past the doorway, past a huge grandfather clock, to a second doorway leading to the den. here, more guests are gathered; a child sits in a small chair by the sofa. he sips a soda as female guest #2 enters the room and crouches down next to him, smiling. she waves to him. he waves back as the camera continues to move past the doorway to reveal holly, standing in front of a hallway mirror, fixing her earrings. mavis can be seen in the background, through the doorway into the dining room, lighting the candles on the table. she dims the lights, darkening the room and the hallway where holly stands in a warm candlelit glow. mavis leaves the dining room and passes holly.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(still fixing her earrings, to mavis)}
<D>__{it's beautiful.}
<A>__{mavis walks off. holly, reflected in the mirror, begins fluffing her hair as mickey enters and wraps his arms around her from behind. the camera stays focused on the mirror; both holly and mickey are now seen in its reflection.}

<D>__{now don't get nervous. it's just your husband.}

<D>__{you know, i was talking with your father before...and i was telling him that}

<D>__{i'm pregnant.}
