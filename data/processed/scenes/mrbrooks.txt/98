<A>__{close on a water glass being filled from a tap.}
<C>__{mr. brooks }
<D>__{god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change, courage to change the things i can, and wisdom to know the difference...}
<L>__{interior kitchen n brooks house day}
<A>__{with a shaky hand, mr. brooks raises the glass to his lips.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{god help me. what do i do?}
<A>__{sitting on the island behind him marshall waits for mr. brooks to gulp the glass dry.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{she did it, didn't she?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{yeah. it'll take the cops a week to ten days to put their case together and then they'll come back and arrest her.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{what are you going to do?}
<A>__{mr. brooks puts his hands over his eyes and sobs, then wiping away the tears:}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i've been afraid of this since the day she was born. she has what i have.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{yes, she does. but you've always been smart about it. she was stupid. she did it because she got off on it, she did it for fun. why didn't she think it through? a hatchet! and she left it there!!}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{they were pretty graphic, weren't they?}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{that was to shock her into making a mistake.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{what does she think i think? doesn't she remember what she told me? that the bmw was being driven across country by a friend and now right in front of me, she tells the cops it was stolen.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{you've always cleaned up after her, whatever she did, all her life.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{if the bmw has anything incriminating in it, i hope it was stolen or she dropped it at the bottom of a very deep lake.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{do you think she knows what kind of trouble she's in?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i think she thought she had gotten away with it until the cops showed up. i should have listened to her, it was there. she was telling me. 'i didn't quit school because i was pregnant'. i should have dug deeper.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{and where would you be but at the exact same place you are now. it is not your fault, earl. part of your problem with her is that you always think it is.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{she has what i have, marshall. so on a very basic level, it is my fault.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{what are you going to do?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{maybe the best thing for her would be to let her go to jail.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{and what about her child?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{emma and i would raise it.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{you might be right, earl, you might be. because you know if she's not stopped, she's going to do it again. and if she wants to take over the box business, the next victim could be you.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i don't think she'd go that far.}
