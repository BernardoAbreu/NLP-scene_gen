<L>__{interior train day}
<A>__{kell and emma on the train, watching buildings slide by outside the window. kell troubled, holding her daughter...}
<L>__{exterior aerial shot of train day}
<A>__{we follow the train traveling a path through canyons of buildings, leaving the city... angle swaps train for car as we drift over a bridge and find nick's car racing across the span...}
<L>__{interior cantrell's house day}
<A>__{nick and garza enter. angle comes around to reveal the house swarming with high tech fbi forensic teams turning the house upside down, tearing things apart, x ray scanning walls... cantrell sits isolated, near tears of frustration, as the place is trashed around him. he glances up, hearing:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{nick? these guys won't even let me pack a bag. not even a toothbrush.}
<A>__{davies enters frame, accompanied by forensic techs not the guys from downtown, but people who work serious ops.}
<C>__{davies}
<D>__{we have granules of an unidentified substance in the ice maker...}
<A>__{he holds up a drinking glass with a few ice cubes, runs a black light wand behind it dark granules become visible on each pass, embedded in the ice.}
<C>__{davies}
<D>__{i'm betting something lethal. tech #1 like this salt.}
<P>__{(pours a small amount)}
<D>__{not sodium chloride. potassium chloride. it's a neuro blocker, stops the heart they use it in lethal injections. you'd be dead before you got up from the table.}
<A>__{nick tosses the others a grim look.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm telling you, clyde has someone working with him. someone on the outside.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{who? who could he have?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{somebody from his past. could be that spook we met on the stairs, for all we know he'd know how to plant this shit...}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{him? no why would clyde let him come talk to us?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{to fuck with our heads? to get us to bring in our adas so he could blow them up?}
<C>__{dunnigan}
<D>__{it would be a clyde move. but it's not proof.}
<P>__{(to cantrell)}
<D>__{could he have planted this stuff in your house before he was arrested?}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{i i don't know...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{jonas, think last few days, have you used any ice? any salt?}
<C>__{cantrell}
<P>__{(confused, grappling)}
<D>__{i don't use salt my cholesterol. ice? yeah not long ago.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{before or after he was arrested?}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{i don't remember! you track your use of ice, nick? you keep a daily log?}
<A>__{tech #2 calls from the kitchen:}
<D>__{tech #2 heads up! looks like polonium here. in his tea pot. same way the russians killed litvenenko. took him two weeks to die.}
<P>__{(off their looks)}
<D>__{it's an exotic isotope. all you need is a trace amount. rips through your organs and bone marrow.}
<A>__{nick's been listening, thunderstruck, paler by the moment. he looks to cantrell sitting there, quiet and shaking.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i will buy you a new toothbrush.}
