<L>__{139 wider angle interior cameron's and sam's room}
<A>__{sam has stopped typing and sits silently, waiting for the storm. cameron lies on his bed in a t shirt and shorts, an elastic bandage around his knee and an ice bag at his neck, coldly watching nina's performance as she grandly moves through the doorway into the room.}
<C>__{nina }
<D>__{...nevertheless, i'm cancelling your invitation to an intimate party given by my parents, who arrived unexpectedly to honor me on the occasion of my birthday...but don't feel too badly. as consolation for a lovely evening missed, i'm presenting you with the "good sport of the month" award.}
<A>__{from behind her back, she takes an apple with a tiny cocktail parasol stuck in it and holds it out to cameron. cameron lies glaring at her with mounting rage.}
<C>__{nina }
<D>__{mr. baum, will you notify this young savage that it's customary to cover one's privates when accepting an award? it's one of the common courtesies, like...congratulating people.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{what should i congratulate you for? the fucking scene or for fucking the director?}
<A>__{nina stands there shaken, looking at him sadly.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{for fucking the director, honey.}
<P>__{(biting into apple)}
<D>__{didn't you know that's how little girls get into the movies?}
<A>__{she leaves. cameron lies there seething, then abruptly leaps up and storms into the bathroom. sam sits rubbing his head, resumes typing. cameron rages out of the bathroom, flings himself onto the bed. unwinding the elastic bandage, he sprays ethyl chloride on his knee. sam's typing stops.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{young man, taking my life in my hands, i must inform you that you are an asshole.}
<A>__{cameron ignores sam.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{being a devout masochist, it follows that i'm eli's best friend. i know quite a lot about him and nina.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{you and the entire crew, buddy.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(wryly)}
<D>__{he met her three years ago. two lonely people rattling around new york. a brutal winter. eli's marriage had just broken up...}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(interrupting in anger)}
<D>__{...all she had to do was tell me!}
<C>__{sam's voice}
<D>__{she could have done that in four seconds. they went to bed once and they were lousy as lovers. but they had a problem. they liked each other. they recognized some area of mutual sensitivity. i'm boring you.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{you telling me he banged her once three years ago?}
<C>__{sam's voice}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{i'm going to see if they can put me up in the employees' toilet.}
<A>__{he begins to type again, then philosophically...}
<C>__{sam's voice }
<D>__{i think he 'banged' her twice to confirm the awful truth...was she supposed to be a virgin?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{but he says this so sadly and looks so miserable that sam knows he has reached him and it touched.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i had a virgin once. had to go to guatemala for it. she was blind in one eye and had a stuffed alligator that said, "welcome to miami beach!"}
<A>__{cameron sits there feeling dumb and full of regrets. then he gets up, goes to sam's closet and begins rummaging through the clothes. sam watches him curiously.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{so how's the new ending coming?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i got fourteen versions. take your pick.}
<P>__{(worried about his clothes)}
<D>__{what are you doing in there?}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(overly casual)}
<D>__{...fourteen gory ways to die?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{thirteen. in one version he lives...turns the girl in, opens a gay bar in berlin, gains fifty pounds and changes his name to goering...}
<P>__{(now deeply concerned)}
<D>__{...please, anything but the sweaters. you'll stretch the hell out of the sleeves.}
