<L>__{exterior desert highway the next day}
<A>__{the town car's parked on a barren stretch of desert highway, white smoke billowing from the hood. half a mile ahead charlie and wesley are walking in the sweltering heat. they're in their shirtsleeves, drenched in sweat as the sun beats down on them.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{see, in a lesabre betty's probably getting twenty two, maybe twenty five miles to the gallon, where we're topping out at fifteen.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{she's probably all cool and fresh, and comfortable in that nice air conditioned car right now.}
<A>__{wesley wipes the sweat from his eyes and trudges on in silence. charlie takes out a photo of betty and speaks to it.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{you don't look comfortable here. that's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? nah. you're like me.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{what the hell's the matter with you?}
<A>__{wesley grabs the photo, tears it in half and tosses it. then he starts walking. charlie is stunned for a moment, but recovers quickly. he finds the pieces and stuffs them in his pocket, then catches up to wesley.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that was a really shitty thing to do.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{i'm sick of looking at her mother fucking face.}
<A>__{a beat... they walk for a moment.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{don't talk like that. she's my last one, wesley, my final target.}
<P>__{(to photo)}
<D>__{don't you realize your special, that you represent something?}
<A>__{this is too much. wesley explodes.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{what? what does she represent?! what could some cornbread white bitch from kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the louisiana purchase possibly mean to you?!! i'd just love to know...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i dunno... something.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why is she doing this to me? why?...}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{i don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.}
