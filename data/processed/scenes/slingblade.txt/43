<L>__{interior garage night}
<A>__{karl sits on his cot eating from the plate frank brought him. frank and linda come through the door. frank comes and sits beside karl. linda gets a guitar case down from a shelf and comes over and stands in front of karl.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. doyle's invited his music playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{they ain't even no good. the only one can play is randy horsefeathers. he claims he's an indian. his real name's randy collins and he works at the feed mill. he can at least play guitar.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{he's no more an indian than i am though. anyhow, doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. just like he does to frank and me sometimes. you just ignore it. or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. he's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. i guarantee it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he ain't ever okay to me.}
