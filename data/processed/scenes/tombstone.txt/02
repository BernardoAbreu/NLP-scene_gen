<L>__{ext skeleton canyon night}
<A>__{the full moon throws fantastic shadows across the high walls of the canyon as the rurales ride through. at the bend the captain halts them. the young one starts to speak but the captain shushes him, peering into the darkness. a few beats then:}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{turn around! fast! now!}
<A>__{but suddenly gunfire erupts from the shadows all around them, blasting them from the saddle, each powder flash lighting up the canyon for an instant, freezing each victim in the moment of his death. then, just as abruptly the firing stops, leaving only the captain, the young rurale, and a 3rd rurale alive. dazed and bloody, they struggle to their feet as 6 armed figures emerge from the shadows, walking into the moonlight toward them. with broad brim hats swept up in front, silk scarves and red sashes, high boots and silver studded gunleather, they look like 17th century pirates. these are the cowboys: old man clanton, the ageless, white bearded leader; curly bill brocius, 2nd in command, smiling, bull necked; ike and billy clanton, the old man's sons; florentino, a mexican half breed; and johnny ringo, dark, byronic, with an air of something very strange. the old man nods to florentino:}
<C>__{old man clanton}
<D>__{tell 'em to get on their knees.}
<A>__{florentino does so in spanish. the others kneel but the captain remains on his feet, steely eyed, defiant.}
<C>__{florentino}
<D>__{he will not kneel. he is proud.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{so how'd you like our little carry on over at that rancho? kinda hit the spot didn't it?}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{animals! butchers!}
<C>__{old man clanton}
<D>__{hey, somebody get that stick on his knees.}
<A>__{curly bill casually fires his shotgun into the captain's legs, dropping him into a splayed lotus position. curly bill knods.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{gracias.}
<C>__{old man clanton}
<D>__{they call me old man clanton. i'm what you might call the founder of the feast. now maybe you ain't heard, but we skylark through your dingy little country just about any time we damn well please and big hat, crummy lookin' free holes stumblin' around in the dark ain't allowed. messican po lice, huh? think you're bad medicine, don't you? hell, i've let stronger stuff run down my leg. so next time we come better step aside. get in our hair again, we'll saw your prods off with butter knives and stuff 'em in your gobs. ain't kiddin' neither. you been told. now git.}
<A>__{the others rise and dash away but curly bill stops the captain:}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{hold up, jefe. got a joke i wanna tell you.}
<A>__{the captain speaks grimly in spanish. florentino smiles.}
<C>__{florentino}
<D>__{he say he know you killing him.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{now how'd he figure that out?}
<C>__{florentino}
<D>__{he say he is no' afraid, someone will revenge for him. a sick horse.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{a sick horse? what the hell...}
<A>__{scattered chuckles from the others but we notice ringo frown and draw his pistol as the captain repeats the words.}
<C>__{florentino}
<D>__{something, i don't know, he talk fancy, you know, like a priest. is like, "a sick horse who sits "}
<C>__{ringo}
<D>__{that's not what he said, you ignorant wretch. your spanish is worse than your english. come on, let's get it over with.}
<A>__{ringo takes aim. the captain sneers, suddenly in english:}
<C>__{rurale captain}
<D>__{you go to hell!}
<C>__{ringo}
<D>__{you first.}
