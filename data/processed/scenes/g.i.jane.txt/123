<L>__{interior situation room n.i.c. day}
<A>__{royce and the spook enter. the vault like door closes emphatically. ensuring their privacy:}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{computer no transcription, no com link, no data link. in fact... shut down sequence 0 niner 0 8, mark.}
<A>__{all around, screens go blank, phone lights extinguish. they sit at the conference table. no computer. no files. just two guys doing headwork.}
<C>__{the spook}
<D>__{all right. so who stands to gain if jordan flames out in a big way?}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{the e ringers? full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time when congress is already swinging the axe.}
<C>__{the spook}
<P>__{(agreeing)}
<D>__{congress cuts, military bleeds. but pentagon's a big place. let's narrow the sights.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{the navy? they've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads. what's it gonna cost to make a fleet of trident's co ed?}
<C>__{the spook}
<D>__{sabotage born of economics? wouldn't be a first. but is hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{possibly. just to spite dehaven.}
<C>__{the spook}
<D>__{hmm. let's aim higher.}
<A>__{royce blinks. "what's higher?"}
<C>__{the spook}
<D>__{the white house. if jordan wins, dehaven wins in spades. why? well, it's been said that the only man the president fears ain't no man.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{the first female president?}
<C>__{the spook}
<D>__{don't for a second think she didn't leak this story. "g.i. jane" gives dehaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{women.}
<C>__{the spook}
<D>__{if you were the president, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{i don't know. seems...}
<C>__{the spook}
<D>__{this ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school. the implications go way beyond.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{christ, i don't want to see her take a fall. she thinks i do, but...}
<C>__{the spook}
<D>__{i take it this file is still open.}
<C>__{royce}
<P>__{(shaping his words)}
<D>__{even tough i don't talk to her every day i still talk to her every day. know what i mean?}
<C>__{the spook}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{okay, so now work it from the other end. think about california and how things might be handled there.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{i don't...}
<P>__{(scoffing)}
<D>__{what, someone on base? a "mole"?}
<C>__{the spook}
<D>__{this is what you get for brain picking an old cia spook. but if i needed to control the outcome of this test case, that's how i'd do it. a man in place. makes everything very controllable.}
