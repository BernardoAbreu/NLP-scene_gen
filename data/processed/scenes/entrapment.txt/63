<D>__{what makes this one so valuable?}

<C>__{mac }
<D>__{except it's chien lung, mimicking sung period. the color is far too delicate.}

<P>__{gin (in mandarin, helpful)}
<D>__{those are the coins. these are my legs.}
<A>__{unnoticed, mac is banging his wristwatch, which seems to have broken. close on him now, manipulating a glide point device on the side of the watch, and we rack focus to see... ...one coin. inside the rope. move. as mac checks to see all eyes are elsewhere, he guides the coin's slide slowly, inexorably, to... ...attach itself magnetically. to the steel pedestal. beneath the bone's case. as it does, mac's watch beeps slightly, as we close on it to see... ...data flickering across its face.}
