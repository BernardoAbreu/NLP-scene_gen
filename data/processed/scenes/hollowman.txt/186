<L>__{interior supply room}
<A>__{sarah finishes collecting blood bags and shuts the door to the fridge freezer. the door slams behind her. she freezes and slowly turns.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{frank?}
<A>__{she eyes the supply room, looking for a sign of movement.}
<C>__{sarah }
<P>__{(frightened whisper)}
<D>__{who's there?}
<A>__{she listens. is that breathing she hears? now she's starting to panic.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{dr. caine?}
<A>__{she starts to back away, but she's already in the corner. she clutches her tranquilizer gun, but there's nothing to aim at. the vials of blood on the shelf gives her an idea. she reaches over, grabs a vial and throws it on the floor. glass shatters and blood smears across the linoleum. sarah tosses another vial and another. becoming more and more hysterical. splattering more and more blood. but she runs out of vials. shaking with fear, she searches the blood looking for a footprint, or movement. but there's nothing there. sarah waits a beat, clutching the tranquilizer gun. takes a step. waits a beat longer. finally she relaxes. it was just her imagination. she heads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper in her ear.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{you missed.}
<A>__{her hair flies up, and she swings against the wall. she tries to move, but she's pinned there. her hands struggling against the force.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{please no. let me go. oh god, let me go.}
<A>__{the arm holding the tranquilizer gun begins to move.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{what are you doing? no!}
<A>__{sarah fights, but her arm moves nonetheless}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{help me! oh god. somebody help me! frank!}
<A>__{slowly, deliberately, her own arm moves down the wall and around, until the tranquilizer gun points right at her stomach. sarah watches in horror as her own body betrays her.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{no... please. don't do this to me.}
<A>__{she struggles, shaking back and forth. writhing. in anguish and in fear.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you.}
<A>__{the trigger pulls .... pop! a dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in sarah's stomach. she whimpers as her eyes glass over. suddenly she's released. she stumbles backward and falls lifeless to the floor. a moment of stillness, all we can hear is the sound of someone breathing. on sarah's face... a slight indentation runs down her cheek.. almost sweet... almost tender. and slight indentation runs across her breast and strokes down her body. the sense of violation and vulnerability is awful. sebastian sighs.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{i've always liked your feistiness.}
<A>__{sarah's head shifts slightly. her head shifts violently, accompanied by the celery crunch of her neck snapping. sebastian exhales, his breath filled with the intoxication of power.}
