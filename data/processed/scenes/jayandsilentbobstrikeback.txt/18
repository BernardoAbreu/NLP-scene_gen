<L>__{interior car later}
<A>__{the nun drives, smiling. jay and silent bob sit in the back seat, huddled close together, their eyes glued on the nun.}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{you both don't have to sit back there. one of you can sit up here with me.}
<A>__{silent bob shakes his head "no" to jay. jay shrugs and climbs up front.}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{so where are you boys from?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{new jersey.}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{what brings you to indiana?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{we're going to hollywood.}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{hollywood, hunh? that's a long ways away.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yeah we're lucky you picked us up.}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{well, do unto others. that's what the book says.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(misinterpreting completely)}
<D>__{wait a minute you follow the book, too?}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{i live my life by it.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{really? you?}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{of course. you know how lonely it gets on the road? thanks to the book, i'm never alone if you know what i mean.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i guess. this guy back there explained it to us. but i didn't think you'd be into that.}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{are you kidding? i've dedicated my life to it. every hour of every day.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{shit you nuns are alright.}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{you live by the book, too?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you picked us up, didn't you? i gotta.}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{that's good to hear. but it takes deed, not words. it's a lot easier to say you live by the book than to actually do it.}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{can you do it?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you want me to do it right now?}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{no time like the present, right?}
<A>__{jay looks back at silent bob. silent bob shakes his head "no." jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder, and starts to bend down.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{alright.}
<P>__{(he suddenly stops)}
<D>__{you hear that? she's not a catholic. she's a presbyterian.}
<A>__{jay disappears below the dash, the nun goes wide eyed.}
