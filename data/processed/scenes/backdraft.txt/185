<A>__{brian, now fully suited up, climbs the endless rungs of an extended aerial ladder.}
<L>__{exterior warehouse roof night}
<A>__{tongues of flame rocket skyward through ragged holes. black clouds drift murderously, roofing tars bubble and hiss as the roof itself groans like a comatose dinosaur, reminding you the whole thing could go any minute and you with it. trudging alone across this alien, spongy surface, brian looks for his company. it's almost impossible to tell anyone apart, faces hidden behind helmets and masks. suddenly a cloud of smoke clears and there's two firemen near the edge, "17" on their helmets.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{stephen }
<A>__{the helmets look up. stephen and adcox. facing each other. adcox cradles an axe.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{brian?}
<A>__{brian starts to move beside stephen but adcox turns, tightens his grip on the axe, and now all the cards are on the table. a hissing black cloud drifts through. they're the only three people on earth. adcox's eyes are clouded with tears.}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{aw man, stephen, listen to me...}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{ what the fuck were you thinking, huh? burning people? you're a fireman.}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{they were killing firemen, man. when sally showed me what was in swayzak's files... they were my friends, i had to do it. i had to do it for the department.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{did you do it for tim?}
<C>__{axe}
<P>__{(pain, to stephen)}
<D>__{that was an accident! jesus christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? why didn't you listen to me!}
<A>__{brian and stephen are backed up against the roof edge sixty feet up. far below a fireboat has begun pumping a massive stream at the side of the building.}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{you gotta let me finish }
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{just come down, john. just }
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{ shut up! your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!}

<C>__{brian}
<D>__{ he killed people }
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{ you know what swayzak would do to the department if this got out? }
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{ stephen, this is bullshit }
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{ what he would do to your dad's department? you gotta let me finish it }
<A>__{and there's a horrible glimmer of confusion on stephen's face.}

<D>__{are you gonna handle it? are you stephen?}
<C>__{stephen}
