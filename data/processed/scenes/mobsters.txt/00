<A>__{h below deck on a ocean going ship night fifty immigrants are packed onto benches along the walls of the small dark room. some eat or talk, but most stare vacantly into space. others sleep curled up among their baggage on the floor. a lamp swinging from the ceiling provides the only light.}
<B>__{salvatore luciano}
<A>__{eleven years old, and bored as hell after thirty days in this pit, leans against his sleeping mother, rosalie, who clutches her seven year old son, bartolo, in her arms.}
<B>__{another family}
<A>__{huddles together, eating bread and sausage. the father looks up and sees salvatore staring. he cuts a piece of sausage and tosses it to the boy.}
<C>__{sausage man}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{your last taste of sicily.}
<A>__{a middle aged man of severe bearing looms in the doorway. he shouts.}
<C>__{antonio luciano}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{rosalie luciano stirs out of her stupor, as antonio grabs the piece of sausage from his son's hand.}
<C>__{antonio luciano}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{we are not beggars.}
<A>__{with a half bow, antonio returns the small chunk of meat. the sausage man shrugs and takes it. salvatore glares at his father. craving revenge, but helpless to get it. rosalie squeezes her son's hand to calm him.}
<B>__{a man sticks his head through the door and shouts}
<C>__{excited man}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{new york! you can see the lights from the deck!}
<A>__{antonio's face lights up, as the passengers roar their approval and rush for the door. close on the kerosine lamp as it lists from side to side with the movement of the boat. we pan down to the nearly empty compartment. watching the door, salvatore paws some baggage, finds the sausage, and cuts himself a healthy piece. he gobbles it down greedily, wiping his hands on his shirt as he runs for the door.}
