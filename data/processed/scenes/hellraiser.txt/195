<D>__{god }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't cry for him. he's dead. he always was.}
<A>__{kirsty has been pushed to the limits of her endurance. she can be terrorized and pursued no longer. death looks an easy option by comparison with more of frank's horrors.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{go on. kill me. i don't care.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{poor baby.}

<D>__{that's right. are you losing your mind, baby? this is frank you're talking to. frank.}
<A>__{as he speaks the bell begins tolling again. frank looks puzzled.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<A>__{light begins to pour through the walls of the room.}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he starts towards the door. but he's too late. the cenobites are standing in his way. he backs off from them.}

<A>__{frank turns on kirsty.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you set me up! you bitch. you set me up!}
<A>__{the pattern of light in the room has become more elaborate, and the cenobites move through it towards frank.}
<C>__{cenobite}
<P>__{(to kirsty)}
<D>__{this isn't for your eyes.}
<A>__{kirsty crosses towards the door. as she reaches for the handle she hears frank roar behind her. she turns. he breaks between the cenobites, knife in hand, but as he comes within striking distance the air is full of whining sounds and he stops dead. they have their hooks in him, we see. in his arms and legs; in his back and sides; in his scalp and neck and temples. hooks attached to countless chains, which arrest his progress. they plough through his flesh as he strives to reach her. but at a gesture from the leader of the cenobites, the chains are hauled in. he flings back his head, yelling. the knife drops from his hand.}
<C>__{cenobite}
<P>__{(to kirsty)}
<D>__{out!}
<A>__{she turns back to the door and opens it. frank is hauled back towards the centre of the room.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{bitch!}
<A>__{the house is growling from basement to eaves now, as kirsty steps onto the landing.}
