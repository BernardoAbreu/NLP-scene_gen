<A>__{kate stands in the empty elevator, waiting for the doors to close. she stares at her feet. just then we hear a burst of a piano being played. it stops. kate looks up to see, across the hallway, in an empty conference room, harvey seated at a grand piano. he smiles a showman's smile before giving it another `old school' burst. he stops again. kate smiles. just then the doors begin to close. kate reaches forward and presses a button opening them. harvey starts up again but this time he plays something sincere beautiful. kate listens before slowly stepping out of the elevator. she walks towards him, joining him at the piano.}
