<A>__{huddled in blankets, on the deck of the ship in steerage. he does not say a word. the waltz grows louder as the view alters, revealing the hundreds of immigrant families huddled together with all their earthly possessions on their way to america. then, suddenly, the waltz stops. the new york harbor day silence. we glide past the statue of liberty. view on the immigrants standing on shipboard silently; looking. vito is standing with them, his eyes wide. camera moves in on the statue, then moving past, on to the beautiful buildings of ellis island.}
