Nick watches the wall clock. It hits 7 o'clock. The warden nods and the guards flick their switches, quickly leaving the room. The warden follows them out, closes the door. We hear the pumps quietly activate. Rupert is taking shallow breaths, terrified...then lays back to wait. PLUNGER ONE slowly descends, emptying its contents into the I.V. lines... Rupert sags as the fast-acting barbiturate spreads through his veins...his breathing slows...his head drops back... he loses consciousness... PLUNGER TWO depresses, sending the second vial of liquid into the I.V. lines with a quiet whir of pumps... PLUNGER THREE activates...then PLUNGER FOUR...the row of cylinders emptying in sequence... Rupert lies unconscious, just drifting away... He suddenly comes to. He draws in a long, shaky breath. It catches in his throat. His eyes go wide. His entire body starts to clench against some increasing pain. Nick is surprised, uncertain. Betsy starts GROWLING SOFTLY at Cantrell's side. Her head comes up, hackles rising. Nick glances to the dog...then to Iger, sees the stunned look on the warden's face. Something is definitely wrong. The pumps keep whirring, the plungers keep descending... Rupert he throws his head back, mouth wide...}
