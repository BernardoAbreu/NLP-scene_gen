<A>__{as big nurse steps out of the nurses' station.}
<C>__{spivey}
<P>__{(to big nurse)}
<D>__{here they are, miss ratched. safe and sound!}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{good. well, boys, did you enjoy yourselves?}
<A>__{a burst of exuberance as the inmates hold up their fish.}
<C>__{fredrickson}
<P>__{(to sefelt)}
<D>__{show her the one you caught, jim.}
<A>__{sefelt whips the sheet off the big fish.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{my, my...}
<A>__{no one can find superlatives or gestures big enough to describe his catching of the big fish, "brought it in himself" ad lib.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{yeah, ya should've come along with us, miss ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{mr. mcmurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{no, it was irresponsible!}
<A>__{big nurse turns to the others, leaving mcmurphy dangling.}
<C>__{big nurse }
<P>__{(respectfully)}
<D>__{that's quite a catch, jim. whaat are you going to do with it?}
<C>__{martini}
<P>__{(crossing to mcmurphy)}
<D>__{gimme a cigarette!}
<C>__{sefelt}
<D>__{i thought i might donate it to the mess hall.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<P>__{(reaches in his pocket; he has none)}
<D>__{i don't have any.}
<A>__{ad libs: "they could use it." "take a picture first."}
<C>__{big nurse }
<D>__{that's an excellent idea. now, why don't you boys place your fish on the gurney and we'll see to it that everyone enjoys a fresh fish dinner.}
<A>__{the men toss their fish on the gurney as martini joins the group and starts hitting the others up for a cigarette. all he gets for his troubles are a series of "no," "get lost," "i don't have any."}
<C>__{big nurse }
<D>__{thank you, boys. now if you'll just go along with mister washington to the showers, supper is in half an hour.}
<A>__{the inmates start ad libbing and laughing, "we're not hungry," as martini sees harding light up a cigarette and crosses to him.}
<C>__{martini}
<P>__{(to harding)}
<D>__{gimme a cigarette!}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{martini}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{i'm not running a charity ward...}
<A>__{martini snaps the cigarette out of harding's hand, and takes off with harding chasing him. martini dashes around the room, pulling chairs in harding's way, taking a drag on the cigarette whenever he can. harding corners martini, but martini tosses the cigarette over harding's head to scanlon. scanlon takes off with harding after him, absolutely livid. scanlon passes to billy who passes to martini. everyone in the room is getting wired. martini throws it away as harding jumps him and nails him to the floor.}
<C>__{martini}
<P>__{(holding his hands up; empty)}
<D>__{all gone! all gone! don't hit! don't hit!}
<A>__{harding starts pounding martini's head on the floor when billy and scanlon jump harding and start pounding him. fredrickson picks up the cigarette and stands there watching the fight as he smokes the cigarette as washington, warren and miller move in and start separating the men. mcmurphy, watching the fight, sighs, then deliberately crosses toward the nurses' station.}
