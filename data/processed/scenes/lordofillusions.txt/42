<L>__{interior quaid's offices fortune telling room night}
<A>__{a mysterious, candle lit space. in the middle of the room, a table. at it sits quaid. thirteen years older. he has been tortured close to death. several small scalpels protrude from his chest and neck. his life is ebbing away. on the table in front of him, a fan of tarot cards, blood spattered. harry races in through the open door from the waiting room.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what the fuck!?}
<A>__{harry picks up the phone. it's dead. miller charges at the door.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{harry slams the door in miller's face, and locks it. as he does so, the candles flicker. harry looks up. a figure looms from the darkness behind quaid. he's in his late twenties: an androgynous, disturbing sight. his long hair is drawn back into a pony tail. his mismatched eyes one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is butterfield. his hands are bloody, and he carries one last scalpel.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(to butterfield)}
<D>__{don't touch him."}
<A>__{butterfield strokes the wounds on quaid's cheek. quaid sobs in pain.}
<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{what are you going to do about it?}
<A>__{miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the other side. his fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock out. harry doesn't move, or miller will be through.}
<C>__{butterfield}
<P>__{(to harry)}
<D>__{ever watched a man die? if you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. and if you're very quick, you can catch it.}
<C>__{quaid}
<D>__{please... butterfield... i wasn't there. ask pimm.}
<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{pimm's dead. jennifer desiderio's disappeared. they knew the puritan was coming home.}
<A>__{as this exchange goes on, miller pulls the lock out of the door and starts to throw himself against it from the other side. it's all harry can do to keep himself from being pitched across the room. he looks around for some means of defense. there's a crack in the drapes to the left of the table. behind it a window.}
<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{so do you. you've seen the future. haven't you?}
<C>__{quaid}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{and are you afraid?}
<C>__{quaid}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{suddenly, harry steps aside. the door's flung open. miller charges in. harry catches hold of his arm, and throws him against the drape. the window cracks; the drape comes down around miller. amber streetlight floods in. butterfield is momentarily distracted. harry strikes the scalpel from his hands. miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the folds of the drapes. harry lands a solid kick to the man's belly. miller is thrown back against the cracked window, which shatters. still wrapped in the drape, he falls out. harry turns back to arrest butterfield, but he's already making his escape. harry starts after him.}
<C>__{quaid}
<P>__{(to harry)}
<D>__{don't leave me.}
<A>__{he turns back. tears are pouring down the man's face. harry goes back to comfort quaid, as butterfield escapes down the stairs.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you need an ambulance.}
<C>__{quaid}
<P>__{(in pain)}
<D>__{too late. why are you here? did you cone... up here for a reading?}
<A>__{quaid takes hold of harry's hand.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no ... i...}
<A>__{quaid stares at harry's hand. fascinated, he momentarily forgets his pain. he traces the lines with bloody fingers.}
<C>__{quaid}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{my god.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{quaid}
<D>__{you've taken some strange journeys in your life.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah. you could say that.}
<C>__{quaid}
<D>__{you're drawn to the dark side, over and over. and it's drawn to you.}
<P>__{(looks at harry)}
<D>__{you don't like that.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{not much.}
<C>__{quaid}
<D>__{you can't change it. you have to walk...}
<P>__{(coughs)}
<D>__{...walk the line between heaven and hell. it's your destiny. accept it.}
<A>__{harry takes his hand from quaid's grip. quaid winces in pain.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hold on.}
<C>__{quaid}
<D>__{i'm not afraid to die. there's something terrible... coming home...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{the puritan?}
<C>__{quaid}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{who is he?}
<A>__{quaid shudders, and dies.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(softly; sadly)}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{he looks away, down at the cards. all have been turned over but one. he turns it. the card is the ten of swords which pictures a prostrate man against a thunderous sky, pierced by all ten swords. an image of death and desolation.}
