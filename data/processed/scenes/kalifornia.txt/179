<A>__{he steps outside and starts firing his gun into the blackness... bullets thunk into the cacti.}
<C>__{early}
<P>__{(shouting over the gunfire)}
<D>__{nobody wants to hurt you peaches!}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{early! stop!!}
<A>__{desperate, adele grabs a large potted cactus. she rushes toward early. swinging the cactus like an unwieldy bat, she pummels the side of his head. he stumbles forward, disappearing into the darkness. adele stands outside the kitchen door, bewildered. then...}
<C>__{early }
<D>__{oww! oww!! fuck!!!!}
<A>__{early re emerges from the shadows. adele's eyes widen when she sees him. his cheek has long bloody gashes where the cactus ripped the flesh.}
<C>__{early}
<P>__{(perplexed)}
<D>__{honey... what do you think you're doin'?}
<A>__{adele starts to cry.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? i'm the one got hit.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i changed my mind, early. i'm not gonna climb up that hollywood sign with you... i decided. i think your mean, and you hurt people.}
<A>__{a look comes over early's face that we've never seen before. that he's never felt before. hurt. he doesn't know how to deal with it. and he definitely doesn't like it.}
