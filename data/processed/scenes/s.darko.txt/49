<L>__{interior library, microfiche research booth afternoon}
<A>__{corey and chris sit before a screen in a cramped, dim booth near the back of the library. they stare at a microfilm article from 1988 about donnie darko's death.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{that was sam's brother?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{on the screen is a photograph of the darko house with many people gathered in front of it. a jet engine is being lifted away by a crane.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{her parents must be going through hell.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{sam said once she wished it landed on her room instead of donnie's.}
<A>__{chris thinks on this.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i saw something on sam's wrist the other night... it looked like a scar.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{she told me it was from some accident. put her hand through a window or something.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{did you believe her?}
<A>__{corey doesn't answer. she pulls up another article, one that chronicles a man who was impaled by a metal pipe with no known origin... a third article is about a little girl who was decapitated by a manhole cover that was inexplicably flying through the air...}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{god...}
<A>__{chris is horrified. corey is totally engrossed. she brings up a final article that tells the story of a boy who was crushed by a dumpster that fell from the sky. a picture shows his legs sticking out from under it like the wicked witch of the east when dorothy's house fell on her in munchkinland.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{i don't understand why we're lookin' at this stuff.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{they still never found a driver to that car that hit randy... i was standing right there. i didn't see anyone.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i was pretty close too, but everything was all crazy. whoever it was must've jumped out and took off.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{i found this book in sam's backpack last night. there's a chapter where it talks about stuff like this happening. like a guy being killed by an arrow that nobody shot, and a swordsmith getting killed by a sword he hadn't made yet. unexplainable things, but it says there's a reason why they happen.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{a book...? i don't get what your talkin' about. what was the reason?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{it didn't say.}
<A>__{corey thinks, trying to figure out the right way to express something...}
<C>__{corey }
<D>__{last night, and right before the accident, i saw...}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{corey sighs and turns back to the screen.}
<C>__{corey }
<D>__{you already think i'm a freak show.}
