<L>__{interior high class home, dining room night}
<A>__{rich, italian decor, long table, laden with food. capos 1 6 sit in utter shock, looking to their boss, concezio yakavetta (37yrs) who heads the table.}
<C>__{concezio}
<D>__{so, there it is. i want everyone to feel free to share their thoughts.}
<A>__{he returns to eating. a moment of silence then the capos burst into anger. capo #1 slams a fist down and stands, silencing the lot.}
<D>__{capo #1 i can't believe none of us were consulted on this! the disrespect! we'd have never okay'd such a thing! a priest! it's an infamita! capo #2 yeah! are we not catholics, for christ fucking sakes?! capo #3 and just for simple revenge?! there's no business in it! you've put us all at risk here! the cops could be all over us! capo #4 forget the cops! what about these saints fuckers?! these guys were long gone! and now you're trying to bring the devil right back to our doorstep?!}
<A>__{concezio wipes his mouth, stands and adjusts his cuffs. he slowly circles the table as he speaks.}
<C>__{concezio}
<D>__{six years ago, with the backing of an adoring public, these vigilante fucks put my father on his knees and executed him...in public. mi patrigno, a blood relative and benefactor to all of you. poppa joe made you rich and his murder remains un revenged...}
<A>__{a few roll their eyes at this verbal blunder.}
<C>__{concezio }
<D>__{this too, is infamita. these homicidal maniacs nearly wiped this family out. it's taken a lot of time to build ourselves up again, brick by brick. and now that we've re acquiesced our original power, can we really afford to have these guys pop out of the woodwork someday and try to finish the job when we least expect it? now, for those of you who have forgotten, let's recap. these fuckers walk into rooms full of gangsters...}
<P>__{(denotes surroundings)}
<D>__{outnumbered, outgunned. they kill everyone...and leave.}
<A>__{some look as if they are starting to get his pointerior}
<C>__{concezio }
<D>__{you think i don't know that each one of you's been waking up in night sweats over this the last couple years? these sons of bitches prison fucked us with no lube, wiped their dicks on our drapes and walked away! and we been living in silent fear ever since. oh, we don't talk about it. rape victims often don't. but it's there. knowing they're still out there, somewhere. thinking...what if?}
<A>__{fear and realization.}
<D>__{capo #4 concezio is right. pretending you don't got a problem don't solve nothing.}
<A>__{heads nod in shameful agreement.}
<C>__{concezio}
<D>__{thank you, doctor phil. so, let's take a moment to look at the serendiplious, diperous, serendip...}
<P>__{(frustration)}
<D>__{...type situation we find ourselves in here. there's a good chance they'll show. no catching us with our pants down this time. we can deal with them proactivitously. the cops were embarrassed by these guys too. with a second bite at the apple, they got every reason in the world to crank up the heat. and as for their doting public. i'd imagine they're gonna lose a few fans.}
<A>__{heads nod all around. sold.}
