<L>__{exterior ian's apartment night}
<A>__{rob is tucked into a phone booth across the street. he can see the silhouettes of laura and ian in the window. he picks up the phone, drops a quarter, and hits the numbers hard as he dials... a muffled male "hello?" is heard and rob hangs up. he does it again. and again. and again. until }
<L>__{interior ian's apartment intercut}
<A>__{still an unpacked box or two, but it's set up: a framed "woodstock the movie" poster, stacks of new fiction, a bread maker you get the idea. ian is shorter than laura, scruffier than rob, and looks not unlike leo sayer steve guttenberg. he stares at laura with amused exasperation. she picks up the phone }
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it's me.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i figured it was.}
<P>__{(re: traffic noise)}
<D>__{where are you?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and i think i know where you are. you're running. on the run. you're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with ian but it's going to be with a world music bunny rabbit looking earth shoe wearing "doctor who" watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that i do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. and with... him.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i'm not hold on...}
<A>__{she walks into another room, shutting the door behind her. on a bookshelf is a picture of a younger ian in a tunic, emoting on some college stage. she turns it face down.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i'm not in love with ian, okay?}
<A>__{she wanders over to the window, looking out absently. she sees rob down there at the phone booth.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{are you still in love with me?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{jesus. i do not know. i will talk to you later.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{think about what i said. i mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever }
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(indignant)}
<D>__{i'm not experimenting. why don't you go experiment.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i don't want to. don't need to. i love you.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you don't ever think about other people?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{no... not really... i mean, i think about it... but no, i don't really think about it.}
<C>__{ian }
<P>__{(through the door)}
<D>__{laura? are you okay?}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(covering the mouthpiece, to ian)}
<D>__{i am fine...}
<P>__{(to rob)}
<D>__{i gotta go. goodbye.}
<A>__{she clicks the phone off. the door cracks and ian sticks his head in.}
<C>__{ian}
<D>__{are you sure you're okay?}
<A>__{she moves past him back into the apartment.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{yeah, i'm fine. i'm off the phone.}
<C>__{ian}
<D>__{you look upset.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i'm upset, but i'm fine.}
<C>__{ian}
<D>__{maybe i should talk to him.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{mmmm, no. not a good idea.}
<C>__{ian}
<D>__{conflict resolution is my job, laura.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{nothing to resolve, ian. let's get a drink.}
<A>__{she grabs her coat and opens the door. the phone begins to ring.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(waving toward the door)}
<D>__{c'mon, c'mon.}
