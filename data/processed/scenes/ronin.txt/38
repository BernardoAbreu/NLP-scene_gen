<L>__{exterior nice day}
<A>__{a dazzling overhead moving shot, establishing that we've changed locales, moved to a place filled with sun and blue water and reflective surfaces: the cote d'azure. we start to move down towards }
<L>__{exterior a private beach nice meanwhile}
<A>__{a topless grandma reclines on a beach chair, soaking up rays, sipping a drinnk just delivered by a young stud of a waiter. nearby at a round table a nice distance from anyone who might try to listen in, we find our group: deirdre, sam, vincent, gregor, swede, and larry. food and drink surround them. larry is, of couse, still eating.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?}
<P>__{(to gregor)}
<D>__{what's your job?}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{i use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target. i trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through nice, relaying that information to you.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(to larry)}
<D>__{nexterior}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(a sigh, he's done this too many times)}
<D>__{you call me with the target's route, i follow along until we've reached the attack point and then i run his squag ass off the road.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(to swede)}
<D>__{which leads us to...}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{i ride with fat boy...}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{eat shit and die slowly...}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{after we stop the target car i get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i blast the lead car into oblivion...}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(picking up)}
<D>__{while sam and i take out the back two cars...}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{leaving...}
<C>__{swede}
<P>__{(picking it up)}
<D>__{...leaving me to step in, drop the target in the back seat, and get the package...}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(with a quick look at sam)}
<D>__{while...}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(returning her look)}
<D>__{...while i back him up, making sure to get the package if something goes wrong and somebody takes swede down.}
<A>__{nobody else seems to notice this look between them, but we should if only to note that there's something about the way deirdre queries sam about his role, and something about the way sam answers her without overly reacting they're not flirting, but there's a kind of acknowledgment of the history they now have between them. but nobody else notices, and swede's line follows sam's without breaking the flow of the dialogue.}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{nobody's taking me anywhere...}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{and then...}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{then swede and i split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{and then...}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{and then sam, you and i clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{very good. now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.}
