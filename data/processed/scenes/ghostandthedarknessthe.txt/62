<A>__{and what we see are a lot of cuts of a lot of activity. huge wooden logs are carried in and hammered to each other and driven deep into the ground the framework for the embankments. and singh carries the heaviest loads and leads the workers and as the structure rises, he is the one darting along the top, high in the air, pulling more logs up, helping here, helping there. and alongside him is his assistant, abdullah, a little man with glasses and very bright eyes. meanwhile, starling is leading construction on the embankment that is on the far side of the river. and he does his best, tries to help on the top part as it rises but alas, he is a bit on the clumsy side and balance is a problem for him. but he stays with it, does well. and patterson, in tremendous spirits, helps when needed, but mostly he is dealing with other aspects of the bridge such as the placements of the three stone foundation pillars he wades into the water, climbs the structures, takes it all in and at the start he is still in the uniform he has worn since the start of the story but it's clumsy for labor so he changes halfway through to civilian clothes which is all he wears from now on. and the workers tire in the heat but singh keeps them going, working with the power of three and there are accidents and explosions, injuries and falls and hawthorne appears when needed to help with the wounded it's hard, brutal work but gradually, the wooden structure part is finished two huge skeletons facing each other across the tsavo river and now work on the roadbed is going full blast and in the river, the three foundation pillars are taking shape }
