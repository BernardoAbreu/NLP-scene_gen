<A>__{graham sits reading a book. there is a knock at his door.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it s open.}
<A>__{cynthia enters the room, looking very intent on something.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{graham sets his book down. he looks at her for a moment, then drags on his cigarette.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{look, i'm just going to come right out and tell you why i'm here, okay?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i'd like to make another tape.}
<A>__{graham thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no? not even one more?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i never do more than one. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i can't talk you into it?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no. you'll have to get somebody else.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{now who the hell is going to do that for me?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{but i want you to do it, i want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody i can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{ouch. okay, i deserved that. cynthia, don't you understand? after the first time it's just not spontaneous. there's no edge anymore. look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. i have never taped anyone twice.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{so make an exception.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{how about if you record over the one we already made? you could have the same date and not use another tape. who would know?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i would.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{well, what the hell am i supposed to do?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{cynthia, i don't know.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i can't believe you're doing this after i let you tape me.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i can't do it.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{goddamit, give me my tape, then.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{cynthia heads for the tape box. graham leaps up to stop her.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(digging through the box)}
<D>__{it's my fucking tape, you asshole }
<A>__{graham grabs her wrists momentarily.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(heated)}
<D>__{no!! i told you what the parameters were and you agreed. it's my tape. i look at it, i touch it, nobody else.}
<A>__{cynthia and graham look at each other for a long moment.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{please go, i'd like you to go now.}
<A>__{cynthia looks at him.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{sure, okay.}
<A>__{she leaves.}
