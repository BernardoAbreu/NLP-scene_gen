<A>__{the endless grey of the hudson river, close now brandon walking along a concrete jetty a rusting building, oxidized and stained salt green, edging along the jetty until brandon reaches the edge of the jetty, looking out the lap of grey water beneath. brandon stands, a hangover kicking in and at once brandon is crying, the tears flowing slow at first until they rush, like floodgates opening. he reaches for breath, trying to stifle the howls emanating from his body, inconsolable now, flooded with emotion brandon sinks squat to the ground, buckled in two, body shuddering. the lap of the water steady now brandon sobs and sobs and sobs, a mess of snot and tears as he looks out over the wide sweep of the hudson river. far off the drone of the freeway, the early evening trawl of traffic kicking in the froth of the tide back and forth, rising and breaking, back and forth.}
