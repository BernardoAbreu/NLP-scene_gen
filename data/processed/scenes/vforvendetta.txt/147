<L>__{interior hall}
<A>__{a path is cleared for the leader. as he heads into the television studio, an armed soldier is heading in the opposite direction. it is impossible to tell because of the dark face plate but it looks like the soldier is smiling. the leader shoves his way onto the main stage. a group of soldiers is gathered around the body.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{who was it? who was he?}
<A>__{the mask is pried off, revealing the lifeless face of roger dascombe. to the leader, it is an obvious revelation.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{roger dascombe! of course. of course! it makes such perfect sense.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{sir, i think there has been a mistake.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{no! there is no mistake!}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{but sir, there are people that say they saw both the terrorist and dascombe together }
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{who? who are these people? they must be detained immediately. whatever they saw or whatever they think they saw is subordinate to the truth and that truth is that roger dascombe is the terrorist and the terrorist is dead!}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{but i thought i was the terrorist.}
<A>__{finch's voice stops the leader cold.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{finch, what are you doing here?}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{since i'm not in jail and since you have another, even more convenient suspect. i'm guessing the charges have been dropped.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{be careful, finch.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{i am careful, sir. always. that is why i suggest that a search of this building begin immediately.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{the terrorist is dead!}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{with all due respect, i disagree and i believe that he is presently trying to get out of this building disguised as one of us.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{are you challenging my authority?}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{no sir, i'm trying to run an investigation }
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{i am trying to run a country! when i tell you, mr. finch, the terrorist is dead, then the terrorist is dead! if you continue to suggest otherwise then you will leave me no choice but to have you arrested on charges of sedition. do i make myself clear?}
<A>__{he eyes the room. everyone is silent.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{now, it is imperative for the people of london to know that they are safe, that the terrorist is dead and everything is under control.}
<A>__{the leader storms past finch who looks at dascombe and bites down on his pipe.}
