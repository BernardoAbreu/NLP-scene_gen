<L>__{exterior residential street evening}
<A>__{jeremy drives the cart down the road, past well kept homes with generous lawns it's a beautiful, upscale community at magic hour. bicyclists and futuristic cars pass, jeremy waves to neighbors. marcus takes it all in with disbelief.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i didn't think there was anything like this left... anywhere.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{yes. we're very lucky. want some?}
<A>__{he holds the plastic bag out to marcus, who obligingly takes a handful of trail mix, pops it in his mouth. after a beat, he spits it back out in his hand, stares at it.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{this isn't food.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{well, of course not. seems you got a little memory loss going on.}
<A>__{marcus stares at him, confused. jeremy is starting to realize just how out of it he is, speaks as if to a child.}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{it's a foam resin. it can taste like anything you want it to but of course, we don't really need to eat.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{our brains are powered by fuel cells, remember?}
<A>__{marcus just stares, jeremy gestures at the world around them.}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{we're in a transitional phase. most of us need the comfort of the familiar a little while longer food, shelter, sex. until we forget the old life.}
<A>__{as he speaks, he notices his bag is nearly empty. he casually lifts his sport shirt and clicks open a panel beneath his rib cage. we glimpse circuits, fiber optics.}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{eating well, chewing it's one of the hardest habits to break... but before long, none of this will be necessary. we won't even need these bodies.}
<A>__{from within he removes an identical bag filled with trail mix (the stuff he just ate), and replaces it with the empty bag. he clicks the panel shut again, pops a nut in his mouth. marcus stares at this, appalled, then blinks and looks away. he reacts to the sound of piano music, a difficult piece being played expertly passing a picture window, he sees a pianist practicing. in front of this home, a gardener and window washer are hard at work. they're both t 400s, with the eerie mask like faces. marcus reacts.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{terminators!}
<A>__{jeremy winces, as if at a racial epithet. he's starting to regret giving marcus a lift, his manner is careful, as if he'd picked up some homeless guy.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{we don't call them that here.}
<A>__{marcus grabs jeremy, who pulls back a bit, alarmed.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{what are you?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{a hybrid. the same as you.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{a hybrid human and machine?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{of course. that's what this community is for people like us.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{jesus... why?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{you should be grateful to have been chosen.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{what about the ones who weren't?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{you mean like janet and the kids.}
<A>__{for a moment, jeremy's expression darkens. then he shuts his eyes, and his features relax.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{your family. you lost them?}
<A>__{jeremy nods and smiles, looking at him once more.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{why are you smiling?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{`cause i feel good. the interface recognizes negative emotions rage, grief, despair and stimulates positive endorphins in response. thank god, life would be pretty unbearable otherwise, don't you think?}
