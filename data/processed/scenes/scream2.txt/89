<A>__{the car makes its way down the deserted street}
<B>__{in the backseat}
<A>__{sidney is beyond frantic. she eyes the ghost through the gate. she turns and twists looking for an escape. through the window, she sees approaching headlights. she screams through the closed window as a car passes by. sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another campus street. big, stone school buildings line each side of a thin, road. she eyes the ghost through the rearview window. the white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her. the ghost hits the gas, picking up speed. sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her. she rips it open, rustling through it frantically. she pulls books, pencils, paper... sid grabs a long, yellow no.2 pencil. she grips it hard, looking to the metal grate just behind the driver's seat. the ghost's neck is right up against it. sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the ghost's head, ready to attack. without pause, sid rams the pencil through the grate, into the ghost's neck. it lodges there as the ghost falls forward in pain, losing control of the wheel for a moment. the car jumps the curb and slams against a building. the ghost yanks the wheel, over correcting. he tries to bring it back to the road but doesn't see the lamp post that stands directly in the car's path. the squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post, slamming into it, bringing the car to a crashing halt, lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior. smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal rumbling.}
<B>__{inside the car}
<A>__{all is still. in the backseat, sidney rises from the floorboards. she looks up to see the ghost masked figure slumped over the steering wheel. out. sid quickly pulls herself together, looking about, sizing up her options. she tugs on the door handle. it won't budge. she looks to the passenger's side of the car. it's flush against the building. then she notices the metal grate. the edge has been pried apart in the crash. sidney reaches for it, pulling on it, bending it backwards... creak! sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while eyeing the ghost who remains unconscious. she creates an opening large enough for her to crawl through. she lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the...}
<B>__{front seat}
<A>__{sid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving the ghost. she lay crumpled up against the smashed passenger's door, the only sound is her own terrified breathing. she watches the ghost masked figure. his body doesn't move. she contemplates her next move. the only way out is through the driver's door. after what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over with her foot and nudges the ghost. no movement. nothing. she slides across the seat towards the ghost, moving to his side. she reaches with her hand and pushes on the ghost's shoulder. his body moves, slumping back against the back of the seat. it clears space for her to pass through. she sits up on her feet, facing the ghost. with her leg, she reaches over him, straddling him. she leans against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching for the door knob. honk! her back brushes against the horn. sid tenses, her face a little more than a foot from the ghost mask. he doesn't move. he's completely out cold. sid pushes the car door open and starts to slide completely over the ghost when she stops. she looks to the ghost.}

<A>__{as she fights with a decision. then, with a fierce determination, sid reaches for the ghost mask. she finds the edge and begins to peels the mask away when...}
<B>__{the ghost comes to life}
<A>__{lunging forward. sidney screams, leaping, falling out the car door.}
<B>__{outside the car}
<A>__{bam! sid hits the pavement hard. she lifts herself up when her entire body is yanked violently backwards. the ghost has hold of her foot, pulling her back into the car. sidney kicks and writhes breaking free. she hops to her feet as the ghost emerges from the car. sidney slams the car door shut. it catches the ghost, knocking him backwards. sid tears off, down the street, running, burning up the pavement.}
