<L>__{interior lonnegan's hotel day}
<A>__{the finest the period had to offer. we pick up hooker coming down the hall to lonnegan's suite. he is admitted by the bodyguard. lonnegan, wearing a smoking jacket, is seated at a table counting a pile of money. there are two other assistants standing behind him. they don't look friendly.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{well, what did i tell ya?}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{you're a lucky man, all right.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{lucky, hell. i could do it every day.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{why don't ya then.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{'cause it's better to do it all at once.}
<P>__{(leaning close)}
<D>__{we're puttin' down 400 grand next week. at 5 1 we make 2 million. twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{you got a system, carver?}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{you stayin' in or not?}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{i'm in.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(drawing up a chair,}
<D>__{barely able to}
<P>__{contain his enthusiasm)}
<D>__{it's foolproof. we got a partner downtown runs the central office of the western union. race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies. all he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner. then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run. it can't miss, unless the western union dicks get onto it.}
<A>__{lonnegan is amazed. he sits back a second, then comes forward again and pushes a pile of bills over to hooker. hooker smiles and begins to count the money.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{you got the 400 grand yet?}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{not yet, but...}
<P>__{(stopping suddenly)}
<D>__{hey, there's only a grand here.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(more like a command)}
<D>__{i think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(getting angry)}
<D>__{what is this? that's my money. you tryin' to muscle me?}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(controlled)}
<D>__{if your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.}
<A>__{hooker's in a jam and he knows it.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{i gotta talk to me partner first. we can't afford to expose our game too much.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{let me talk to him.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{you want your money back? try and get it in a court of law.}
<P>__{(softening a bit)}
<D>__{c'mon, don't be a sorehead. i will make it worth your while. migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.}
<A>__{hooker says nothing for a minute, and then reluctantly nods his head.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{four o'clock tomorrow. pick me up at dewey lyle's.}
