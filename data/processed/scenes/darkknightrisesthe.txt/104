<L>__{interior batcave night}
<A>__{alfred is studying security camera footage of bane killing at the stock exchange. a roar builds the waterfall glows brighter until...smash! the bat breaches, downdraft spraying water. two cubes rise the bat lands, batman jumps out. alfred brushes water off his suit.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{very inconspicuous. shall i tell the neighbors you got yourself a new leaf blower?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{we bought all the neighbors.}
<A>__{alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{from the look of the television coverage, you seem to have your taste for wanton destruction back.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(pulls out usb drive)}
<D>__{i retrieved this.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{shouldn't the police be gathering the evidence?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{they don't have the tools to analyze it.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{they would if you gave them to them }
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{one man's tool is another man's weapon.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{in your mind, perhaps. but there aren't many things you couldn't turn into a weapon.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{alfred. enough. the police weren't getting it done }
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{perhaps they would've if you haven't made a sideshow of yourself.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{perhaps you're upset you were wrong.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{wrong?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{you thought i didn't have it in me.}
<A>__{alfred looks at him. puts down the cape and cowl.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{you don't. you lead a bloated police force on a merry chase with some fancy new toys from fox. what about when you come up against him. what then?}
<A>__{alfred points to the monitor wayne sees bane killing...}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i will fight harder, i always have.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{when you had something to fight for. what are you fighting for now? not your life.}
<A>__{wayne moves to switch off the monitor. alfred grabs his hand.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{take a good look. at his speed, his ferocity, his training. i see the power of belief. of the fanatic. i see the league of shadows resurgent.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{you said he was excommunicated.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{by ra's al ghul. who leads them now?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{ra's al ghul was the league of shadows. and i beat him. bane's just a mercenary, and we have to find out what he's up to.}
<A>__{wayne plugs the usb in, hits keys. text scrolls.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{trades of some kind. coded...}
<A>__{the screen blanks, a thumb print appears.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{is that ?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{mine. courtesy of selina kyle.}
<A>__{wayne pulls out the usb, rises.}
<D>__{get this to fox he can crack the code and tell us what trades they were executing.}
