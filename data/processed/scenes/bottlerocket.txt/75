<D>__{i felt terrible. i'd known swifty since first grade. he was dignan's medicine man for indian guides. they called each other rattlesnake and killer whale. whenever dignan came to visit me he would act like he and swifty weren't that good of friends, but that was just to make me feel better. the whole rest of the school had turned against me.}
