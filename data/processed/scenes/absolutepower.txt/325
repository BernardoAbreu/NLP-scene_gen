<L>__{interior hospital kate's room night}
<A>__{ collin moves a step further into the room and now there is something in his hand a hypodermic needle. kate. out of it. lying there, eyes closed. collin, the needle ready, moving silently toward the bed. kate is barely breathing. and now suddenly collin is barely breathing because the other doctor's arms have viced around collin's neck, forcing the air out of him. collin, stunned, trying to struggle the doctor jerking collin's body into the air his feet are dangling now the hypodermic needle drops to the bed as the struggle goes on and collin's in fabulous shape. he's young and power ful and he's been in terrible situations before and he knows how to fight and he's been taught to defend himself and tough shit the doctor it's luther relentlessly increases the pressure against collin's throat collin can't even gasp now his feet can't kick anymore his body starts to go limp his eyes start to slide up into his head silence in the room it's almost over which is when suddenly luther lets go. collin, eyes flickering open as luther lays him down on the floor. all this next is whispered.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{scream. go on. which do you want most, for me to kill you or life in jail forever?}
<A>__{he has gone across the room to the bed. collin tries to move, can't. the hypodermic needle as luther picks it up carefully, starts back to collin.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{going to guess this wasn't to pep her up.}

<A>__{luther. kneeling by collin now.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{that's because you didn't know your crime, prick.}
<A>__{ and now he jams the needle against collin's neck. collin tries to cry out, but luther covers his mouth.}
