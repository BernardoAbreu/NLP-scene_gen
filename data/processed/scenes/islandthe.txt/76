<L>__{interior. foundation level}
<A>__{a dead acoustic. a corridor paved with sound proofing panels. it ends at a pressure door, where lincoln and ester now arrive. lincoln looks back to the elevator at the other end. no going back. he slots the tri key into the lock. the door hisses open.}
<L>__{interior. foundation chambers}
<A>__{amber light. the sound of slow bubbling. lincoln and ester pause to adjust to the gloom. they are in a hall of windows. ester is the first to venture forth, as if drawn, to the nearest window. behind the glass is a foundation tank. bubbling with viscous fluid, laced with various tubes pulsing matter to and fro. the tubes connect to a form. a human form, an adult form but curled foetally. i t is known as a "nascent". in this tank is a female nascent, shifting slightly, causing ester to gasp. the nascent registers the noise, turning its head. its eyelids are closed but its eyeballs move, questioning. a slight furrow appears on its crosshatched brow. ester recoils in sudden horror, perhaps remembering on some deep level that this is where she came from.}

<D>__{ester ! come on!}
<A>__{spurred to action, ester follows lincoln onward up the hall. still conscious of movement all around, of nascents stirring at the sound of their footfalls like the ripples of a nightmare.}
