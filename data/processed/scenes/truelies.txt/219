<L>__{exterior warehouse day}
<A>__{harry appears through the doors, marching dana by the arm. he walks her over to some industrial junk nearby, overgrown with weeds, and sits her down for a talk. she is sullen, still mortified from getting dragged out in front of her friends.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{there are going to be some changes dana. you're going to start following some rules. and i'm going to be there to see that you do.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{yeah, right.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you're going to stay in school. do you understand?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{why? so i can wind up like you? what's the point?}
<A>__{you think harry's going to really rain on her parade. but he doesn't. he becomes very tender. he pushes the hair back from her face.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{did i tell you about the time we first met?}
<A>__{she looks up at him, puzzled?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you were quite young at the time. all wet and still attached to your mom by a cord. you opened your eyes and looked right at me. and i knew then i would always love you with all my heart.}
<A>__{dana stares at her father with a dawning awareness. this is not just some chump that she has to put up with. this is her father. he is a part of her. no matter what happens they are in this thing together. tears start to run down her cheeks.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{somewhere along the way i got lost, honey. i forgot about what was really important. i'm sorry pump i mean }
<A>__{she grabs his in a fierce hug. harry closes his eyes, letting the moment purify him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{dana, regarding this singing }
<A>__{she pulls back, suddenly wary. oh shit.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{you were pretty good.}
