<L>__{interior salieri's salon late afternoon 1780's}
<A>__{cu, the manuscript in mozart's handwriting. the music begins to sound under the following:}
<C>__{old salieri }
<D>__{displace one note and there would be diminishment. displace one phrase, and the structure would fall. it was clear to me. that sound i had heard in the archbishop's palace had been no accident. here again was the very voice of god! i was staring through the cage of those meticulous ink strokes at an absolute, inimitable beauty.}
<A>__{the music swells. what we now hear is an amazing collage of great passages from mozart's music, ravishing to salieri and to us. the court composer, oblivious to constanze, who sits happily chewing chestnuts, her mouth covered in sugar, walks around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping them on the floor when he is done with them. we see his agonized and wondering face: he shudders as if in a rough and tumbling sea; he experiences the point where beauty and great pain coalesce. more pages fall than he can read, scattering across the floor in a white cascade, as he circles the room. finally, we hear the tremendous qui tollis from the mass in c minor. it seems to break over him like a wave and, unable to bear any more of it, he slams the portfolio shut. instantly, the music breaks off, reverberating in his head. he stands shaking, staring wildly. constanze gets up, perplexed.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{is it no good?}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{it is miraculous.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{oh yes. he's really proud of his work.}
<A>__{another pause.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{so, will you help him?}
<A>__{salieri tries to recover himself.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{tomorrow night i dine with the emperor. one word from me and the post is his.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{oh, thank you, sir!}
<A>__{overjoyed, she stops and kisses his hand. he raises her and then clasps her to him clumsily. she pushes herself away.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{come back tonight.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{tonight?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{alone.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{some service deserves service in return. no?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{isn't it obvious?}
<A>__{they stare at one another: constanze in total disbelief.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{it's a post all vienna seeks. if you want it for your husband, come tonight.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{but! i'm a married woman!}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{then don't. it's up to you. not to be vague, that is the price.}
<A>__{he glares at her.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{he rings a silver bell for a servant and abruptly leaves the roam. constanze stares after him, horrified. the servant enters. shocked and stunned, constanze goes down an her knees and starts picking up the music from the floor.}
