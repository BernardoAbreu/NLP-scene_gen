<A>__{kipling and raincoat alien react to the horn honk. they spot tuggle through the store window and open fire }
<B>__{blasting through the glass.}
<A>__{a civilian car enters the intersection. the engine is hit by shotgun fire, and the car skids to a stop in the intersection, steam rising from the radiator.}
<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{tuggle dives behind a lamp post. the driver is out of the car now, brings up the machine pistol to fire at tuggle. sykes sees this and opens fire at the driver. the driver turns and fires at sykes. sykes ducks down, and the car he's hiding behind is sprayed with bullets. a forty foot moving van pulls down the street between sykes and the driver. once the truck is past, sykes is standing behind the bullet riddled car, gun ready. he rapid fires creaming the human driver. tuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the shotgun fire from kipling and raincoat alien.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{get outta there!}
<C>__{tuggle}
<D>__{i can't! do you mind!}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{i will cover you! get outta there!!}
<A>__{sykes rises and runs across the street toward the getaway car, firing toward the store as he goes. kipling and raincoat dodge behind cover. tuggle seizes the opportunity, jumps from behind the lamp post and runs to the stalled civilian car. he slides across the hood and drops behind the car for cover. tuggle slowly pokes his head up to peer through the car window. his gaze is met by the face of the old man driver who is still inside the car.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{can i get out now?}
<C>__{tuggle}
<D>__{move it!}
<A>__{sykes doesn't have a clear firing line on the aliens in the store. as he considers his next move tuggle fires at the two aliens. they return fire and he slides down to safety behind the car. or so he thinks. glass rains down on him as the car windows are cremated by the shotgun blasts. he flinches as another blast hits the car. he looks over. there's a big exit hole in the fender beside him. the shot went right through the car. another exit hole is blasted, inches from his shoulder. panicked, he scrambles along the side of the car blasts and exit holes following him until he reaches the front of the car. he has nowhere left to go and a blast comes through the car and catches him squarely in the chest throwing him back onto the street. sykes' head jerks around in time to see his partner of nine years blown away. kipling keeps firing in tuggle's direction until his shotgun clicks empty.}
