<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{carla sits on the bed, straddling curtis, who lies beneath her. she is looking right at danny. curtis, unaware of him, keeps thrusting into her from below. danny starts to leave, but on second thought stays. carla stares expressionless, yet more attentive to him than to curtis. indeed, their eyes never leave each other, so that when she becomes aroused, we understand that it is danny she is responding to, danny she is really making love to. gradually her face loses its aloofness and seems to reach out to him, to reveal feelings that she can no longer deny. she holds her gaze until, at the final instant, she shudders out a series of stifled cries. when she looks again, the window is empty.}
