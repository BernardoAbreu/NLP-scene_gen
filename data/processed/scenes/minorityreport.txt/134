<L>__{interior the precog chamber}
<A>__{the room is utterly dark and silent. the silence is broken by the sound of something rolling across the floor. somebody speaks, probably the guard.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{an explosion of light fills the room in strobe like blasts. and leaping through the light is anderson. the temporarily blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees. anderson stun guns them quickly. the strobes fade, and anderson sets a zirc flare on the floor. we see that the enzyme is wearing off his facial features are returning to normal. he is oblivious to the precogs in their chairs. it is the equipment he is after. through the observation window we see ennis page watching in horror as anderson severs the light cables connecting the precog helmets to the mainframe. anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window, blowing it out and knocking page unconscious. then he reaches into the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series of blasts. anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a presence behind him. perhaps it is because the movement is so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection. a hand, the fingers pale and slender, reaches out and takes hold of his hand. anderson whirls around, weapon out. and there before him, is the female precog. he looks at her, then beyond her to the other precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in their chairs. her helmet is off. she is young, but her close cropped hair is silver white. and when she speaks, her voice is like the wind whispering through time.}
<C>__{female}
<D>__{save us, anderson.}
<A>__{anderson can feel the seconds ticking away, his carefully planned operation interrupted in an unfathomable way.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{i have to get out of here.}
<A>__{she grips his hand.}
<C>__{female}
<D>__{save us.}
<A>__{it is beyond pitiful, this frail little woman, pleading. and her eyes, she won't let him go. she is beginning to weaken, to sway on her feet. a sudden realization floods over anderson.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{you let me get here, didn't you? you stopped giving them information, so they couldn't track me.}
<A>__{the precog female is fading fast. she tries to reach out for him and her legs give way.}
<C>__{female}
<D>__{save }
<A>__{and what can anderson do but catch her before she falls? what can he do but throw her over his shoulder, and in the fading light of the flare, make a run for freedom.}
