<L>__{int van houten's home same}
<A>__{lidewij leads gus and hazel into a living room so sterile it's creepy. the walls are empty and white, there's a single couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair. that's it. van houten sits in the chair. off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and twist tied.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{trash?}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{fan mail. 18 years worth. he never opens it.}
<A>__{van houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his slippers. he motions for them to sit on the couch.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{yours are the first missives to which i've replied and look where that got me.}
<A>__{hazel and gus take their seats.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{scotch?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{um, no thanks.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{augustus waters?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{it's 11am.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{just me then, lidewij. scotch and soda.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{perhaps some breakfast first peter?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{she thinks i have a drinking problem.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{i also think the earth is round.}
<A>__{nevertheless, lidewij pours peter half a glass and hands it to him. he takes a sip, then sits up straight.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{so you like my book.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{yes. we well, augustus, he made meeting you his wish so that we could come here and talk to you.}
<A>__{van houten says nothing. takes a long pull on his drink.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{did you dress like her on purpose?}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(looks at her shirt)}
<D>__{kinda.}
<A>__{van houten says nothing to that.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i do not have a drinking problem. i have a churchillian relationship with alcohol: i can crack jokes and govern england and do anything i want to do. except not drink.}
<A>__{he glances over at lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{incidentally, thank you for dinner last night.}
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(to lidewij)}
<D>__{we bought them dinner last night?}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{it was our pleasure.}
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{you've come a long way so... what is it i can do for you?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{we have some questions }
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{uh huh...}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{about what happens, you know... after... the end of your book. specifically to those who anna leaves behind. like her mom, the dutch tulip man, sisy }
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{how familiar are you with swedish hip hop?}
<A>__{hazel looks at gus. is he kidding?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i would say... limited?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{but presumably you know afasi och filthy's seminal album "flacken."}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{um...}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{lidewij! play `bomfalleralla' immediately.}
<A>__{lidewij sighs but she does as she's told. a few seconds later, some loud swedish rap song blasts from the speakers. hazel and gus sit through this, totally baffled.}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(yelling over the music)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir. we don't speak swedish.}
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{who the hell speaks swedish? the important thing is not what nonsense the voices are saying, but what the voices are feeling.}
<A>__{the song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before gus has enough. he gets up and turns off the music.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{are you messing with us?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{pardon?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{is this some kind of performance?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{rudolf otto said that if you had not encountered the numinous then his work was not for you. and i say to you, my friends, if you cannot hear afasi och filthy's bravadic response to fearfulness, then my work is not for you.}
<A>__{hazel is really getting worried at this pointerior they came all this way for this?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{so anyway... when the book ends, anna's mom }
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(raising a hand to silence her)}
<D>__{let us imagine that you are racing a tortoise.}
<A>__{hazel and gus fidget in their seats. lidewij frowns, clearly feeling bad for them. van houten continues.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{the tortoise has a ten yard head start. in the time it takes you to run ten yards, the tortoise has moved maybe one yard. and so on, forever.}
<C>__{van houten }
<D>__{you are faster than the tortoise but you can never catch him, you see, you can only decrease his lead. now certainly you can run past the tortoise as long as you don't contemplate the mechanics involved but the question of how turns out to be so complicated that no one really solved it until cantor's proof that some infinities are bigger than other infinities.}
<A>__{hazel and gus have no idea how to respond.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i assume that answers your questions.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(to hazel)}
<D>__{i don't know what's going on.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{and yet you seemed so intelligent in print, mr. waters.}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{must be all that cancer in your brain.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{peter!}
<A>__{gus could throw a punch right now. hazel tries to calm the situation.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{can we please, maybe, talk about anna for a sec? i mean, i understand that the story ends mid sentence because she dies or she becomes too sick to continue }
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i'm not interested in talking about that book.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{ but that doesn't mean her family and everyone she loves doesn't have a future, right?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i said i'm not interested }
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(getting upset)}
<D>__{but you promised!}
<P>__{(calms herself)}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{mr. van houten, you said you would tell us what happens and that's why we're here. we... i need you tell me. surely you've thought about it. i mean, as characters }
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{nothing happens to them! they're fictions. they cease to exist the moment the novel is over.}
<A>__{this is not what hazel came all this way to hear. she won't accept it.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{they can't!}
<P>__{(again, has to calm herself)}
<D>__{i mean, i understand. in a literary sense. but it's impossible not to imagine some future }
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i can't do this. lidewij, get rid of them, please.}
<P>__{(lidewij doesn't move, he turns back to hazel)}
<D>__{i won't indulge your childish whims. i refuse to pity you in the manner in which you're accustomed.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i don't want your pity }
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{of course you do. like all sick kids, your existence depends on it.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{peter!}
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(on a roll)}
<D>__{you are fated to live out your days as the child you were when diagnosed, the child who believes there is life after a novel ends. and we, as adults, we pity this, so we pay for your treatments, for your oxygen machines. we give you food and water though you are unlikely to live long enough }
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{peter!}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{you are a side effect of an evolutionary process that cares little for individual lives.}
<C>__{van houten }
<D>__{you are a failed experiment in mutation.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{i resign!}
<A>__{lidewij has tears in her eyes. gus has balled his fists. but not hazel. van houten's words have not phased her one bit. she rises from the couch.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{hey listen douchepants. you're not gonna tell me anything i don't already know about illness. i need one thing and one thing only from you before i walk out of your life and that's for you to tell me what happens to your goddman characters!}
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i cannot tell you.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{bullshit!}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i cannot }
<A>__{van houten goes to take a drink but...}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{make something up.}
<A>__{... hazel smacks it right the fuck out of his hands, surprising everyone. after a beat:}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{lidewij. i will have a martini please.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{i have resigned.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{oh don't be ridiculous.}
<A>__{no one moves. van houten realizes he's alone in this.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i'd like you to leave now.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you're really not gonna tell us?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i would like you... to leave.}
<A>__{hazel is furious. gus stands next to her, touches her arm is if to say "come on, enough of this guy." cut to:}
