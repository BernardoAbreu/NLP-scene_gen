<L>__{interior hospital stairwell same time}
<A>__{we find the owner of the helping hand was nicole who returns to a quiet spot along the wall of the stairwell as she demurely smokes a cigarette.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{whip leans his cane against the wall and carefully pulls a pack of smokes from his pocket.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{i didn't think anyone would have the same devious thought about using the fire stairs to have a smoke...}
<A>__{nicole smiles and looks down, awkward around men when she is not loaded. she drops her cigarette which we see was barely smoked as she maneuvers to leave.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{don't go. i will be quiet.}
<A>__{he offers her a cigarette, she takes it.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{we don't have to talk. be nice to just smoke with someone.}
<A>__{and they do. they sit in silence as the stairwell fills up with smoke. after a long beat...}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{were you on the plane?}
<A>__{whip studies her, she's beautiful in an exhausted way...}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{yeah, i was. were you?}
<A>__{nicole shakes her head.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{where were you sitting?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{up near the front.}
<A>__{again it falls silent as we let them smoke and think in the sanctity of the fire stairs. a voice breaks their silence.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{tobacco's but an indian weed, grows green in the morn, cut down at eve; it shows our decay, we are but clay;...i love the smell of nicotina in the morning. smells like...victory.}
<A>__{we hear a metallic rattle and whip and nicole look to the stairs.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{don't flee dear comrades! really, wait for me, please.}
<A>__{a gaunt young man makes his way to their landing. he is dressed in a hospital gown and carrying an i.v. pole on which hangs a small bag of clear liquid. the man's hair has completely left him. his skin is gray. eyes hollowed from his battle with cancer.}
<C>__{gaunt young man}
<D>__{can i bum a smoke?}
<A>__{whip offers him a cigarette. he takes it and fires it up with a lighter he keeps stowed in the pocket of his gown.}
<C>__{gaunt young man }
<D>__{i should quit, my cancer might get cancer.}
<P>__{(silence)}
<D>__{joke. you guys in the plane crash?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{he was.}
<A>__{whip looks at the ground as the gaunt young man studies him.}
<C>__{gaunt young man}
<P>__{(it hits him)}
<D>__{you're the fucking pilot.}
<A>__{nicole gives whip a look.}
<C>__{gaunt young man }
<D>__{i saw you on tv. holy shit, man. tough deal, but you walked away or it looks like you limped away.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{yeah, i'm lucky. goin' home tomorrow.}
<C>__{gaunt young man}
<D>__{home. home for me is the basement, they keep cancer treatment in the basement. i'm livin' here.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{you're living here?}
<C>__{gaunt young man}
<D>__{no. i'm dying here.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{what kind of cancer?}
<C>__{gaunt young man}
<D>__{fibro mixzoid sarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma. very rare, god chose me.}
<A>__{gaunt young man laughs.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{god chose you? you believe in god?}
<C>__{gaunt young man}
<D>__{fuck yeah bitch. you're a stupid fucker if you don't believe in god.}
<A>__{the god topic has silenced the stairwell...}
<C>__{gaunt young man }
<D>__{as soon as you realize that the random events in your life are god...you will live a much better life. you spend your life believing that you have all the control over what happens. bullshit. the plane you're flying goes down? out of your control. god gives you cancer. i have no control over that. did god give me cancer? you bet your ass god gave me cancer. you think if i begged for cancer god would have given it to me? no...because i assure you i have begged for god to take it away and guess what? i have no control over that.}
<A>__{gaunt young man smokes the cig to the nub and rubs the remains against the smooth concrete wall.}
<C>__{gaunt young man }
<D>__{can i get another smoke? what's wrong with you honey? you're beautiful, do you know that? do i scare you? people either have to pretend they don't see me or they're drawn to me. it's funny because people see me as being close to the other side they feel like i have power or wisdom. they think i have the answers. who knows? maybe i do. death gives you perspective. i lived my life so indecisive, in a haze. but now that i'm dying everything is so clear. it all makes sense somehow. i'm sorry but i can't get over how beautiful you are? look at your arm, you an addict?}
<A>__{nicole looks at him. she nods.}
<C>__{gaunt young man }
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{nicole.}
<C>__{gaunt young man}
<D>__{what do you do in the world nicole?}
<A>__{she laughs, what a question.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{not much. i was a photographer and then i was a masseuse and i wash hair at a salon sometimes.}
<C>__{gaunt young man}
<D>__{where is it? i will come by, i'm easy, you can wash my head.}
<P>__{(she smiles)}
<D>__{do you think you're gonna die?}
<A>__{nicole laughs to keep from weeping.}
<C>__{gaunt young man }
<D>__{you're not. you're not gonna die.}
<A>__{the men watch as nicole quietly cries, it's powerful.}
<C>__{gaunt young man }
<D>__{don't you love her?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i don't know her.}
<C>__{gaunt young man}
<D>__{bullshit, i do. random act of god? don't think so. survive a plane crash to meet a gorgeous girl in a stairwell. fuck you man.}
<P>__{(he reflects, then...)}
<D>__{i'm sure they're looking for me. my family just showed up from utah. you know it's bad when they start flying in. every morning is special now, i'm so grateful. it's a trip, wish i could bottle this feeling i have...about how beautiful every breath of life is..}
<A>__{gaunt young man starts laughing. whip joins him.}
<C>__{gaunt young man }
<D>__{can i get a smoke for the road?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{here's a pack.}
<C>__{gaunt young man}
<D>__{thank you, i will pass them out in the cancer ward. take care nicole, you're gonna be okay.}
<A>__{the gaunt young man leaves, clanging away with his i.v. pole. nicole wipes away her tears, we see her hospital bracelet as well as her track marks.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{chemo brain. chemo makes you pretty foggy.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{they call it chemo brain, my mom used to slur her words and get all chatty.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{your mom had cancer.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{breast cancer, she was only 54.}
<A>__{it's quiet.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{but why'd that guy ask you if you were gonna die?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i dunno. i flat lined twice in the ambulance. heroin addicts who use needles tend to die. especially women for some reason.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i have a pamphlet to prove it. a girl from aa just came to see me }
<P>__{(it's quiet)}
<D>__{that guy was a trip. he made it feel like, i dunno...we were the last people left on the planet..}
<P>__{(drops her smoke)}
<D>__{...and together we should save the world.}
<A>__{nicole steps on her cigarette and puts the nub in her pocket. she begins to leave. whip stops her.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{well, where should we live? if we're gonna save the world, where should we do that?}
<A>__{nicole laughs.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{you don't want me.}
<A>__{whip laughs.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{you don't want me either.}
<A>__{nicole's laugh tapers off as she senses his honesty.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{where do you live?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{why you wanna come visit? it's luxurious.}
<P>__{(silence between them)}
<D>__{i live in bankhead, it's south atlanta, near the bus station.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{the luxurious bus station?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i will come visit you.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{you're sweet.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i will. what's your address?}
<A>__{she measures him.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i live at the georgian gardens on taylor street.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{georgian gardens?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{how long are you staying here?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{trying to stay as long as i can but i don't have insurance to cover rehab. i will prolly be out tomorrow.}
<C>__{whip}

<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i've been every kind of masseuse there is.}
<A>__{there is strong tension between them. an orderly busts through the down the stairs. this breaks their stare.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{good luck nicole.}
