<A>__{shot of dave wilkie, a longer shot than the first. the man is now arguing angrily with two airline representatives, still waving his ticket and shaking his head. we don't hear him. lip readers might pick up what he is saying: "i'm supposed to be in first class, not tourist. what's the matter with this friggin' airline?"}

<A>__{illcox hillyer, a close shot of his face as he rubs his chin and frowns obviously struggling to remember the man. the camera holds on him as he stares at the gaunt angry dave, racking his brain. he shakes his head, he cannot place the man and yet he knows him. the camera moves in closer on willcox hillyer's face as he stares in pensive puzzlement at this ghost from the past and now we hear, as if from a distance, faint music on the track it is "dixie," played with beautiful lazy mocking love by the great louis armstrong in his prime. at first we can barely hear it, then the music becomes louder as hillyer's frown deepens and he seems almost to know the man. main title (superimposed): "rambling rose" the music remains a bit in the distance, but it can be heard. other titles (superimposed): over the following action. various shots, on willcox hillyer. he gives up his effort to recognize the strangely familiar dave with a little shrug, turns and walks away with his travel bag.}
