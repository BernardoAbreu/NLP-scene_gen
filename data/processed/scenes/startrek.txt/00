<A>__{over blackness, we hear a bach harpsichord concerto. and then a woman breathing hard straining, harder and harder until finally we hear a newborn baby crying and we...}

<L>__{exterior vulcan family home dusk}
<A>__{the image is spectacular, aglow in dusk light: a beautiful baby, just born, held in a woman's hands. it is being cleaned; warm water runs down its face and body. tight on the midwife (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the baby as it cries. another, younger, midwife can be seen behind her, assisting with the pitchers of water. as she cleans the baby, she says to someone off camera:}

<D>__{he is strong.}
<A>__{the baby, now calm, gets swaddled. he is then gently held out to the new mother: amanda grayson, late 20's. an original beauty. she lies on a divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. she tenderly takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized. she holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly:}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{... hello.}
<A>__{close on the younger midwife, standing at the rear of the room. she raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks:}
<C>__{younger midwife}
<D>__{the baby is healthy. why does she cry?}
<C>__{midwife}
<P>__{(a beat; then)}
<D>__{she is human.}
<A>__{a distant, quiet buzz and the elder midwife stands, looking into the distance. and this is when we see, for the first time, that the midwife has pointed ears.}
<C>__{midwife }
<D>__{sarek arrives.}
<A>__{the midwife moves away we push in on amanda, who looks up for a moment, clearly disquieted.}
