<A>__{sol and max play go. sol is peaceful while max is distant. max plays a piece absently. sol counters with a deafening atari. max whispers:}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{euclid crashed. i lost all my data, my hardware.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{your mainframe?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{burnt...}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i don't know, first i got these horrible picks. then euclid spits out some numbers. never saw anything like it and then it fries. the whole machine just crashed.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{you have a printout?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{of?}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{the picks, the number?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i threw it out.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{what was the number it spit out?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i don't know, just a long string of digits.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{sol}
<P>__{(intense)}
<D>__{what was it, a hundred and fifty, a thousand, two hundred sixteen!? how many?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i don't know. probably around two hundred.}
<P>__{(wondering)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{sol}
<P>__{(beat)...}
<D>__{i dealt with some bugs back in my pi days. i was wondering if it was similar to one i ran into.}
<A>__{sol begins to feed his fish. he points to one.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{have you met archimedes. the one with the black spot. you see?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{remember archimedes of syracuse? the king asks archimedes to determine if a present he's received was actually solid gold. unsolved problem at the time. it tortures the great greek mathematician for weeks. insomnia haunts him and he twists and turns on his bed for nights on end. finally, his equally exhausted wife, she's forced to share a bed with this genius, convinces him to take a bath, to relax. while stepping into the tub he observes the bathwater rise as he enters. displacement. a way to determine volume. and thus, a way to determine density, weight over volume. and thus, archimedes solves the problem. he screams "eureka!"greek for "i found it!"and is so overwhelmed he runs dripping naked through the streets to the king's castle to report his discovery. now, what's the moral of the story.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{that a breakthrough will come...}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{wrong. the point of the story is the wife. listen to your wife, she will give you perspective. meaning, you need a break, max, you have to take a bath, otherwise you'll get nowhere. there will be no order, only chaos. go home and take a bath.}
<A>__{public bench moments later max waits for his train on an empty platform. just then, he hears a dripping sound. max looks up and notices something across the tracks on the other platform. he can't quite make it out because his vision is blocked by columns. he gets up and spots a young hasidic man standing at him. blood drips from the man's hand. max doesn't know what to make of it a train swishes by }
