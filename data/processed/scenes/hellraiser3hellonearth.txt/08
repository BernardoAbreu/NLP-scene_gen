<L>__{interior emergency room night}
<B>__{the doctor}
<A>__{ is on the floor, as if flung there by some powerful force. the fibrillator pads are still in his hands and his expression is awe struck and disbelieving.}
<B>__{the nurse}
<A>__{ is cowering behind a mobile tray of surgical instruments, muttering to herself and making the gesture of the cross.}
<B>__{the two paramedics}
<A>__{ are flattened against the far wall, terror on their faces.}
<B>__{angle on table}
<A>__{the boy is on the emergency table. it's him that's screaming. his body is arched tight in shock, eyes and mouth wide open. he's wired up to an ecg and the monitor shows a heartbeat that should be measured on the richter scale. the chains all still connected to his face and his body are rigid and tight, being pulled straight up into the air as if tugged taut by invisible hands. the boy's skin is stretched and pulled at those points where the chains are connected to him and it seems horribly possible that his flesh will burst if the pressure continues. the scene is held for a terrible frozen moment. then suddenly the chains drop, the scream stops, and the boy's body slumps. there is a massive electrical surge. the ecg flat lines before it and the other monitors go haywire, sparking and spluttering.}
