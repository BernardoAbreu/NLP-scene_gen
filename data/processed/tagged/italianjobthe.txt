<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i tracked steve down to an address in the hollywood hills. he's changed his last name to frezelli. and get this: he had a worthington 1000 installed in the house before he even moved in. we both know that you don't install a worthington 1000 unless you have something precious to guard.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{precious or not, i don't deal with ill gotten goods.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we boosted that gold from a terrorist group that was about to trade it for bio weapons. now that doesn't exactly make us robin hood, but maybe in our own little way we were doing a good deed. problem is, no one in my crew can handle that safe. and i need someone i can trust.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{and you think that's me? haven't you heard that i work for the other side?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what i heard is that you have your father's touch. and he was the only safecracker i knew who could open a worthington 1000.}
