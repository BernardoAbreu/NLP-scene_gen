<A>__{frank stands at the mirror putting on a clean shirt.}
<L>__{interior wheeler kitchen dining room afternoon.}
<A>__{april stands at the kitchen table chopping vegetables. she wears an unflattering floral dress. frank stands in the doorway watching.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's beautiful out.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{yes; it's lovely.}
<A>__{he glances at the calendar.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you know what today is?}
<A>__{she doesn't look at him.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{it's twelve weeks.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{he walks over to her. he takes her in his arms. she stiffens.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{look, this has been kind of a crazy summer. we've both been under a strain. i mean i know you're upset.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{you know i'm not sleeping with you and you want to know why?}
<A>__{she looks him straight in the eye.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{well, i'm sorry frank, but i don't really feel like talking about it.}
<A>__{she pulls herself free of his grasp. he watches as she adds the vegetables in the pot on the stove.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay. what do you feel like talking about?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{would it be all right if we didn't talk about anything? can't we just take each day as it comes, and do the best we can, and not feel we have to talk about everything all the time?}
<A>__{he smiles patiently.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't think i suggested we talk about everything all the time. my point was, we've both been under a strain and we ought to be trying to help each other as much as we can right now.}
<A>__{she's utterly uninterested and it's making him nervous.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{i mean god knows my own behavior has been pretty weird lately... i mean, as it happens... there is actually something i'd like to tell you about...}
<A>__{she continues folding the napkins.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{i've been with a girl in the city a few times.}
<A>__{finally, she stops moving. she looks at him.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{a girl i hardly even know. it was nothing to me, but she got a little carried away. she's just a kid... anyway, it's over now. it's really over. if i weren't sure of that i guess i could never have told you about it.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{why did you?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{baby, i don't know. i think it was a simple case of wanting to be a man again after all that abortion business. some kind of neurotic, irrational need to prove something.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{no. i don't mean why did you have the girl; i mean why did you tell me about it?}
<A>__{he is suddenly unsure.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{i mean what's the point? is it supposed to make me jealous, or something? is it supposed to make me fall in love with you, or back into bed with you, or what? i mean what am i supposed to say?}
<A>__{he tries that same patient smile, but it's not convincing.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{why don't you say what you feel?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i don't feel anything.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{in other words you don't care what i do or who i fuck or anything?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{no; i guess that's right; i don't.}
<A>__{she is frighteningly calm.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{fuck who you like.}
<A>__{his panic mounts.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't you see...don't you see, i want you to care.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{oh, i know you do. and i suppose i would if i loved you. but you see i don't think i do anymore. and i only just figured that out. and that's why i'd just as soon not do any talking right now.}
<A>__{she goes back into the kitchen. frank follows her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh, now don't give me this shit! you know god damn well you love me!}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{you think so?!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you know god damn well!}
<C>__{mrs. givings }
<D>__{yoo hoo! any one home?}
<A>__{frank and april stare at each other, breathless.}
