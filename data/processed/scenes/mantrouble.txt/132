<L>__{exterior dirt road in eddy's jeep night}
<A>__{the jeep pitches about on its shocks as it moves up an incline graded slightly higher than the one already giving harry trouble. eddy shifts into four wheel. joan, jostled about by the uneven surface beneath them, looks over at him:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{why did you do these things?}
<C>__{eddy}
<D>__{because you deserved it.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i didn't deserve it. i've always thought of you and treated you as one of my closest and dearest friends...}
<C>__{eddy}
<D>__{i use to think very highly of you, too, but now i don't like what i see. in fact, it's been very disturbing to me, joan.}
<P>__{(pauses, then)}
<D>__{very disillusioning. to see that before you've even gotten rid of lewie, you've started up with some other man.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{eddy, i want you to take me home now.}
