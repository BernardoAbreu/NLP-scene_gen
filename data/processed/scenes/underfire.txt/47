<L>__{interior jazy's house day}
<A>__{the pool is visible in b.g. his house, like the pool, is rumpled and slightly sloppy though it betrays the taste of its occupant books everywhere, pictures on the wall, nothing cheap or tacky but everything is well worn.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{you were arrested because the guardia are clowns who specialize in excess. you were released because i told them to release you.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{these are not the normal duties of a businessman.}
<A>__{he looks at them directly.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{but they are the normal duties of a... spy, eh? you win, i'm a spy.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{there, are you happy? i feel better.}
<A>__{he refills their glasses.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{now we can relax. you can turn off your little thing.}
<A>__{the red light of her recorder is on. she smiles slightly, undisturbed, and turns it off.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{oh, i trust you won't say anything to hurt me. in some ways i'm a terrible spy. i used to be much better at it, but now it seems everyone knows who i am. i have too many girlfriends. i like to be photographed.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i talk too much.}
<A>__{price and claire are almost afraid to speak, afraid to interrupt this strange performance.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{i always talk too much... but my girlfriends like that... no matter.}
<P>__{(pointing to the swimsuited woman)}
<D>__{you know who she is?}
<C>__{claire and price}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{that's miss panama. do you know who that is?}
<C>__{claire and price}
<D>__{oh, yeah, yes, etc.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{she's in love with me. i've got to get some water in the pool.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and once a week i have lunch with president somoza to discuss security measures against the sandinista insurgents, but all he wants to talk about is miss panama... he's worried about her.}
<A>__{claire interrupts with a smile.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{because he thinks she's seeing another man?}
<A>__{jazy smiles slightly before confirming.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{...and he assigned me to find out who the man is.}
<A>__{they all smile at this complication. price is impressed. jazy changes the subject with fluent and disturbing ease.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{we all know the revolutionaries are going to win, don't we?}
<A>__{silence. they don't know how to respond.}
<B>__{their p.o.v. as miss panama stretches like an enormous cat}
<A>__{they all are slightly entertained and glad for the relief. unsure what to say next, price notices a picture on the wall: closeup a blown up framed photo of the ranch house with}
<B>__{pool}
<A>__{the same picture we saw on the leaflets in africa.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{there's a rumor about this picture. some people say you're a genius that you invented this scheme.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{it was lots of people's idea... have you been to leon?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{we're going to masaya... they say the rebels have hit the cuartel.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{it's supposed to be nasty there... a lotta people think rafael's in the south. i want to find out.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{no, no, it's not "nasty" yet. another week maybe.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you would love leon. a nice cathedral and beautiful light... et un peu de bang bang.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{we're not doing a travelogue, you understand.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{of course, of course... only i have heard that comandante rafael has recently had his unit in the area.}
<C>__{price}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{rafael is near leon?}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{well... it's a rumor, what do i know?}
<A>__{the voice of miss panama.}
<C>__{miss panama}
<D>__{estoy desemperado!}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{she's lonely!}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{don't let us stand in the way.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{it's my job.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you think i talk too much?}
<A>__{he doesn't wait for an answer, but excuses himself and goes out to tend to miss panama. p.o.v. of jazy and miss panama by the empty pool as jazy touches her, whispers, and she waves to claire and price.}
