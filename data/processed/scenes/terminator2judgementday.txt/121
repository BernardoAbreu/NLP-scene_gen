<L>__{exterior parking lot night}
<A>__{john is now sitting on the curb, lost in stunned thought. terminator stands above him, watching the street like a doberman. he glances down at john.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we spent a lot of time in nicaragua... places like that. for a while she was with this crazy ex green beret guy, running guns. then there were some other guys. she'd shack up with anybody she could learn from. so then she could teach me how to be this great military leader. then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho. didn't you know? it's like... everything i'd been brought up to believe was just made up fantasy, right? i hated her for that.}
<P>__{(he looks up)}
<D>__{but everything she said was true.}
<P>__{(he stands)}
<D>__{we gotta get her out of there.}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{negative. the t 1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy sarah connor and wait for you to make contact with her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh, great. and what happens to her?}
<A>__{terminator's reply is matter of fact.}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{typically, the subject being copied is terminated.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{terminated!? shit! why didn't you tell me? we gotta right now!}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{negative. she is not a mission priority.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!}
<A>__{john strides away. terminator goes after him and grabs him arm. john struggles against the grip. which doesn't do him much good.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey, goddammit! what's your problem?}
<A>__{starts dragging john back to the bike. john spots a couple of collage age slab o meat jock types across the street and starts yelling to them.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{help! help!! i'm being kidnapped! get this psycho off of me!}
<A>__{the two jocks start toward him. john yells in outrage to terminator.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{let go of me!!}
<A>__{to his surprise, terminator's hand opens so fast john falls right on his butt. he looks up at the open hand.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oww! why'd you do that?}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{you told me to.}
<A>__{john stares at him in amazement as he realizes...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you have to do what i say?!}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{that is one of my mission parameters.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{prove it... stand on one foot.}
<A>__{terminator expressionlessly lifts one leg. john grins. he's the first on his block...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{cool! my own terminator. this is great!}
<A>__{the two guys get there and look at terminator standing there calmly with one leg up in the air. this big guy in black leather and dark glasses, standing like a statue.}
<C>__{first jock}
<D>__{hey, kid. you okay?}
<A>__{john turns to him. no longer needing to be rescued.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{take a hike, bozo.}
<C>__{first jock}
<D>__{yeah? fuck you, you little dipshit.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{dipshit? did you say dipshit?!}
<P>__{(to terminator)}
<D>__{grab this guy.}
<A>__{terminator complies instantly, hoisting him one handed by the collar. the guy's legs are pinwheeling.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{now who's the dipshit, you jock douchebag?}
<A>__{immediately, things get out of hand. the guy's friend jumps behind terminator and tries to grab him in a full nelson terminator throws the first guy across the hood of a car grabs the second by the hair, whips out his .45 in a quick blur, and aims the muzzle at the guy's forehead. john grabs terminator's arm with a yell as he pulls the trigger john's weight is just enough to deflect the gun a few inches. the guy flinches, stunned by the k boom next to his ear. he stares, shocked. pissing himself. john is freaking out, too. he screams at terminator.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{put the gun down! now!!}
<A>__{terminator sets the .45 on the sidewalk. john scoops it up fast then turns to the shocked civilians, who can't believe what just happened.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{walk away.}
<A>__{they do. fast. john grabs terminator by the arm and tugs him toward the bike. john still holds the gun, reluctant to give it back.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{of course. i'm a terminator.}
<A>__{john stares at him. having your own terminator just became a little bit less fun to him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{listen to me, very carefully, okay? you're not a terminator any more. alright? you got that? you can't just go around killing people!}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{whattaya mean, why? 'cause you can't!}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you just can't, okay? trust me on this.}
<A>__{terminator doesn't get it. john just stares at him. frightened at what just almost happened. he gets a glimpse of the responsibility that comes with power. finally he hands the .45 back to terminator, who puts it away.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{look, i'm gonna go get my mom. you wanna come along, that's fine with me.}
