<T>__{over black:}
<A>__{in the darkness, we hear the solitary sound of a heartbeat, resounding like a drum.}
<C>__{narrator }
<D>__{in between the years when the oceans drank atlantis and the rise of the sons of aryas, there was an age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world like blue mantles under the stars. hither came conan, the cimmerian: a thief, a slayer, a king born of battle.}
<A>__{muffled sounds, as if underwater, echo: clanging swords, the guttural cries of combat.}
<B>__{unborn baby}
<A>__{eyes closed, floating at peace within red glow of the womb. suddenly, a flash of steel, as a sword pierces the womb, its tip not an inch from the baby's head. as the sword is ripped out, light streams in from outside, we travel with it, into the din of battle.}
<L>__{exterior cimmeria muddy field day}
<A>__{a blonde haired, armored aesir raider withdraws the bloody sword from the stomach of islene, a wild maned cimmerian beauty, many months pregnant, now clutching her bloody stomach. across a muddy battlefield, the air a maelstrom of falling snowflakes and embers from trees aflame, the powerfully built corin rallies his fellow cimmerians, until he spots islene.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{islene!!!}
<A>__{wielding a broadsword, runes etched into its surface, corin cuts a bloody path through his enemies, his eyes never leaving islene. the aesir standing over islene laughs as she claws at the earth behind her, trying to pull herself away.}
<C>__{aesir}
<D>__{now, now little whore. did i get you or your little one?}
<A>__{islene's hand reaches back once again and it finds a fallen warrior's sword. in one fluid motion she swings the sword around her body and drives it into the gap in the aesir's armor at his groin.}
<C>__{islene}
<D>__{i'd ask you the same.}
<A>__{the aesir howls in agony, raising his sword to deliver the killing blow when another sword pierces his chest. the aesir falls, revealing corin standing behind him. corin throws aside his horned helmet, and falls to his knees beside islene, checking her wound. when he pulls his hands back they are coated in blood. their eyes meet. torment. loss. they both know. she pulls a knife from the folds of her pelts, puts it in his hand.}
<C>__{islene }
<D>__{take your child.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{i cannot.}
<A>__{islene looks to her naked belly. the baby inside presses against its womb, a visible impression on her flesh.}
<C>__{islene}
<D>__{there is no time, husband. i would see my child's face.}
<A>__{islene's eyes flutter as she struggles. corin lowers the knife. islene's eyes lock with corin's as he puts the knife to use. never once does she scream. a moment later, corin lifts the crying, blood covered boy up through the falling snowflakes to islene's lap.}
<C>__{islene }
<D>__{a boy. he will be strong. a warrior with no equal.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{do not speak, love.}
<C>__{islene}
<D>__{you have never been able to still my tongue, and you will not this day. he will be wild, corin. you must temper him.}
<A>__{she shares one kiss with her child, its first taste not of mother's milk, but of her blood.}

<L>__{exterior cimmerian village day}
<A>__{a small cimmerian village lies in a heavily forested valley, a redoubt from the icy mountains surrounding it. round wooden huts surround a stone lined pit, where young cimmerian boys, ages 12 15 stand. pollen drifts through the air, giving it an ethereal haze. at the center of the pit uran, an elder cimmerian warrior speaks.}
<C>__{uran}
<D>__{a cimmerian warrior is like any other man. a cimmerian warrior feels hunger. he feels cold. like other men he may lie and cheat.}
<P>__{(stares the boys down)}
<D>__{but when a cimmerian warrior hungers, he hungers only for the blood of his enemy. when he feels cold, it is the cold steel of his sword. when he lies, he lies in wait for his enemy. and when he cheats, he cheats death itself!}
<A>__{uran stops at the end of the line, where a boy stands a good two heads smaller than the rest. he is no more than eight, but his face is as stoic, driven.}
<C>__{uran }
<D>__{conan! you are too young to be here. withdraw.}
<A>__{conan, determined, doesn't move an inch. the largest teen menacingly steps up to the smaller boy.}
<C>__{largest teen}
<D>__{he said leave, motherless whelp.}
<A>__{the hulking teen goes to shove conan, but conan pulls his arm towards him, lashing out with his other hand, punching the teen in the throat. the large boy goes down hard, hands and knees, gasping for air. a smattering of laughs erupt from the boys, quickly silenced by uran's stare. uran hands out river stones to each boy, ending with conan. the boys know what to do: they put the large stones in their mouths.}
<C>__{uran}
<D>__{in the black crag in the high pass stands a wooden training sword. the one who claims it, with stone still in his mouth, will have earned the right to train with the warriors.}
<A>__{the boys look at each other, sizing up the competition.}
<C>__{uran }
<D>__{well? what are you waiting for?!}
<A>__{and off they run. they knock each other down, punching the other's stomachs, each trying to force the other to expel their stones. one or two succeed. most of the remaining boys run for the trail that winds high into the mountains. but a few head right for the sheer cliff face. conan follows the ones headed to the cliff.}
<B>__{cliff face}
<A>__{and when the cimmerian boys climb, it is a sight to behold. they find cracks we can barely see and scale the smooth rock face as though it were a ladder. the hulking teen reaches for the same handhold as conan, trying to knock him off. conan swings with one hand and finds another path. in moments he is ahead.}
<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{conan is in the lead as he crests the cliff top, the bigger boys right behind him. they race through the forest, heading uphill when conan spots movement ahead. he pauses and the largest teen elbows past conan, into the lead. the boy runs two paces more and suddenly flies off his feet, an axe lodged squarely in his forehead. all the boys stop. out of the dense forest come}
<B>__{four pictish savages}
<A>__{covered with fearsome war paint and armed with dual hand axes, the rotting heads of their enemies are slung at their waist. the boys spit out the rocks in their mouths and yell. they turn and run in the opposite direction. only conan doesn't move, even as another boy pulls at him.}
<C>__{cimmerian boy}
<D>__{conan! run!}
<A>__{but conan simply pulls the axe from his large boy's skull. he turns to face the picts, his eyes burning. the picts laugh and charge conan.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{corin arrives with uran and other armed cimmerian warriors. they get a brief glimpse of a single pict, escaping in the other direction. one of the cimmerians takes off in pursuit. corin desperately searches for his son.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{conan? conan?!}
<A>__{conan steps forward from out of a thicket, his body covered in pict blood. three picts lie massacred, the bodies hacked to pieces.}
<C>__{corin }
<D>__{what have you done, boy?}
<A>__{conan walks past the other stunned cimmerians, up to his father. conan spits out the bloody stone from his mouth.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{they killed one. i killed three. i am a warrior now.}
<A>__{uran and the other cimmerian men exchange worried glances. looking at the carved up bodies of the picts, they are aghast. conan looks confused. why aren't they happy?}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{a warrior? what you have done a jackal would do. never a warrior.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{they would have done the same }
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{as i said, jackals.}
<P>__{(to uran)}
<D>__{he is not ready. i will forge him myself.}
<T>__{cut to: training montage:}
<A>__{conan is tested under corin's watchful eye: forced to sleep in the snow, while his father keeps warm inside. a heavy boulder on his shoulder blades while he balances on wet river rocks. climbing a cliff face, his bare hands leaving blood behind on the jagged rocks.}
<L>__{interior cimmerian forge day}
<A>__{flames reflect in the blue eyes of conan as he works the bellows of the forge. sparks buzz like angry fireflies as he stokes the blaze. corin sharpens a sword, perfecting it. conan cannot take his eyes off it, stepping away from the bellows.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{stoke your fire, boy.}
<A>__{conan slams the bellows closed, anger rising.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{"stoke your fire, chop your wood." i have slept where wolves dare not. i have balanced a thousand river stones. when will you teach me the sword?}
<A>__{corin stares his son in the eyes. judging.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{think you're ready? then tell me: what is a sword's purpose?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{to slay ones enemies.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{no. that is what it does. its purpose is why you use it.}
<A>__{he tosses conan two lumps of ore.}
<C>__{corin }
<D>__{tell me, which makes the best sword?}
<A>__{conan takes the two lumps, testing them. he hands his father back one.}
<C>__{corin }
<D>__{the stronger ore, eh? then we shall make a sword of it, and tomorrow you will show me what brute strength yields.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior field dusk}
<A>__{with a setting sun silhouetting the two, conan attacks corin. conan attacks with fury. corin defends with grace. until the boy overextends and corin slashes down a counterattack that shatters conan's sword. corin simply turns and walks away, leaving conan to puzzle what happened. corin lowers his sword and walks away, leaving conan to puzzle what happened.}
<L>__{interior corin's forge night}
<A>__{conan works the bellows, putting his back into it. corin places both ores in the furnace where they begin to melt.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{why did it break?}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{because it had no life.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{sparks fly as corin pounds on the glowing edge of the sword with hammer. corin nods at conan, who sprinkles the glowing blade with ash.}
<D>__{corin (o.s.) (cont'd) the strongest blade isn't made of the hardest steel, boy. the hardest ore is what a man will die for. it is strong and unyielding. it neither cowers nor concedes. but without the softer ore, it can be shattered like glass.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{steam rises as corin lowers the blade into a freezing slack tub, only to place it right back into the flames.}
<C>__{corin }
<D>__{the softer ore is what a man lives for. it is flexible and lasting. it survives, even against the greatest of foes. but too much of the soft ore, the blade will not cut deep enough when it must.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{corin fashions the blade's hilt, engraving the guard and pommel. it is a work of art.}
<C>__{corin }
<D>__{a sword must be tempered, the two ores united through fire and ice. through its suffering the sword comes to hold both life and death.}
<A>__{corin hands conan the sword.}
<C>__{corin }
<D>__{now tell me, what is this sword's purpose?}
<A>__{conan furrows his brow, trying to puzzle the answer. he can't. corin's disappointment shows. he takes the sword from conan's hands.}
<C>__{corin }
<D>__{this one is not ready yet.}
<A>__{blood rushes to conan's face but he says nothing. he rushes out.}
<L>__{exterior mountain lake day}
<A>__{frustrated, conan slashes through a field of reeds, cutting everything within reach of him, expending his rage. behind him something moves in the forest. we catch just a glimpse of the pict, the same one that escaped conan in the earlier scene. conan's instincts cause him to spin around but then there's nothing there.}
<L>__{interior cimmerian scout post day}
<A>__{built into the side of a huge tree, fifty feet up, this wooden structure houses two cimmerian sentries. a bird cries in the woods, causing one of the sentries to investigate. thwick! he suddenly stands up straight, unmoving. the one still sitting in the structure notices.}
<C>__{cimmerian sentry}
<D>__{see something?}
<A>__{the standing sentry falls backwards, revealing an arrow piercing his right eye. shocked, the remaining sentry reaches for the warning horn mounted on the wall. but as he reaches for it, his shadow becomes three dimensional, morphing into}
<B>__{a shadow scout}
<A>__{a thin, feral humanoid, bodies covered in tattoos, from the deepest jungles of zingara. the scout lashes out with his black sword and cuts straight across the sentry's throat. this shadow scout's name is remo.}
<L>__{exterior scout post day}
<A>__{remo exits and stares down at cheren, a blind archer clad in lamellar armor and a conical sedge hat. cheren has an arrow notched and ready, but somehow he knows not to fire. cheren lowers his bow and lets out a bird whistle and the forest comes alive. the forces are an odd combination; massive kushite tribesmen, dark skinned savages from the savannahs of kush, and a legion of aquilonian mercenaries, heavily armored knights drawn from the cities of aquilonia. their leaders, respectively, are the six foot five kushite chief ukafa, gold toothed, his body painted for battle, and the handsome, silver armored aquilonian lucius.}
<C>__{ukafa}
<D>__{that's the last of their guard towers.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{all this sneaking around for a lowly tribe of barbarians.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{this lowly tribe of barbarians have buried every warrior ever to set foot on this land, lucius.}
<A>__{khalar singh, a warlord atop a black horse, rides through the fog shrouded trees. he bears a nomadic visage, with tanned skin and almond shaped eyes. while his voice is calm, his eyes burn with malice.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{that is only because they have never faced my legion.}
<A>__{khalar regards lucius with amusement.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{then show us. but should you fail, remember the plan.}
<A>__{lucius scowls as he delivers a bow to khalar singh.}
<L>__{exterior cimmerian village day}
<A>__{corin walks out of the forge, looking around for conan. various other cimmerians go about the daily routine, but conan is nowhere to be seen.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{conan?}
<A>__{corin looks to the ridge above the village, noticing a thick fog creeping in. the fog curls and eddies, something is out there. suddenly, lucius and his legion of silver armored warriors burst out of the fog, attacking with speed and strength. but the cimmerians are hardly caught flat footed. in seconds they are armed, and they counter the charge with a furious charge of their own. slam! sword and bone collide as the two enemy fronts smash into each other. and the battle devolves into one on ones where the barbarians have the upper hand. uran and corin lead the main push of battle frenzied barbarians as they swing their huge broadswords, extending their reach advantage over the aquilonian's shorter weapons. and quickly, the aquilonian's numbers are cut in half. corin squares off against lucius himself. lucius is sweating. worried. it wasn't supposed to be this hard.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{retreat!}
<A>__{as a unit, the aquilonians race back into the woods. in seconds, the cimmerians give chase in wild pursuit.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{wait! hold your ground!}
<A>__{but it's too late, nearly half the cimmerian warriors are gone on the chase.}
<L>__{exterior cliff face day}
<A>__{lucius and the aquilonians race up to a sheer cliff face. nowhere left to run. they turn to see the cimmerians gathering in front of them.}
<C>__{uran}
<D>__{death is in the air, invaders. can you taste it?}
<C>__{lucius}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{indeed. i savor it.}
<A>__{uran notices something is wrong. his eyes go skyward. atop the cliff stand cheren and a dozen more of his blind archers, bows at the ready with flaming arrows. they let the arrows fly, streaking balls of flame heading right for the cimmerians. but they do not hit them. they hit the tree trunks beside them. and for a moment, the cimmerians look relieved, until they notice small bags of a black substance tied to the arrows. the flames lick at the substance kaboom! the forest erupts into flames as the cimmerian warriors are burned alive.}
<L>__{exterior mountain lake day}
<A>__{conan spins, started by the sound of the explosion. he sees flames rising above the treetops beyond. he races back home.}
<L>__{exterior cimmerian village day}
<A>__{corin sees the flames in the distance as well. suddenly, ukafa and his kushite warriors erupt out of the forest. armed with fearsome barbed spears they charge the remaining cimmerians, savage against savage. but the kushites are not alone. from behind the cimmerians comes, akhun, a massive four hundred pounds of flesh, wearing loops of chains like armor, leads his turbaned turanian horsemen into the village. the cimmerian women arm themselves, but the horsemen attack with nine tailed whips pulling their swords from their hands and dragging them to the ground. the horsemen quickly gather up the women while ukafa and his men keep the cimmerian warriors all too occupied.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{conan rushes through a river, now tinged red with blood, and reaches the far end of the village. huts burn, women are chained, only a handful of cimmerians still stand. lucius and his aquilonian mercenaries are helping the spearmen slay the wounded. conan grabs a fallen sword and rushes for the nearest aquilonian and runs him through. a zingaran spots him and rushes him with his spear. conan readies himself for the}

<A>__{corin, sporting a deep gash to his abdomen, pulls a reluctant conan from the battle, back toward the forge.}
<L>__{interior forge day}
<A>__{the flames of the forge still burn as corin pushes conan into the room. he bolts the door behind him.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{do we need more weapons?}
<A>__{corin drops his sword, then struggles to lift a heavy grating in the dirt floor. beneath it a trough of cooling water leads under the hut and away from the village.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{go. there is a hunting lodge in the north pass with provisions.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{no! i will fight!}
<A>__{corin grabs conan by his tunic, pulling him up to his face. corin's eyes are half crazed.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{this fight is over, but yours has just begun. you wanted to be a warrior of the tribe, conan now you must be its last.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{father, i am not afraid to die.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{good. make your death have purpose.}
<A>__{boom. something slams at the door. it does not budge. again,}
<B>__{boom.}
<A>__{a shadow appears under the door, sliding into the forge, and materializing into the form of remo. remo quickly slides away the bolt. in rush enter lucius and ukafa. corin and conan face their attackers, fighting in close quarters. lucius rushes at conan, only for conan to duck under his attack and throw him in the fiery forge. lucius screams in agony, rising up to reveal half of his formerly handsome face burned to a crisp. corin fights ukafa to a standstill, until remo emerges from the shadows behind him and drives a short sword into his back. corin falls to his knees.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{lucius delivers a massive backhand, sending conan flying backwards and demolishing one of the forge's main support beams. half of the forge comes crashing down on top of conan, pinning his bleeding form to the ground, just a few feet from his fallen father. enraged, lucius turns his anger to corin, raising his sword to deliver the killing blow.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{i said i wanted a word with him.}
<A>__{lucius stays his hand as khalar singh steps into the forge. beside him stands the pict who escaped from conan earlier, grinning from ear to ear. khalar singh hands him a bag of gold.}

<P>__{(strange dialect subtitled)}
<D>__{their heads. you promised me their heads.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{all you wish, once we are gone.}
<A>__{the pict nods and heads off, drawing his knife. khalar singh stares down at corin, sizing him up. corin lifts up into a sitting position, back to the forge.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{i take no pleasure in this day, barbarian. your people are fierce warriors, deserving of every story told of them. but now you must choose the story for yourself. i am khalar singh. my army is handpicked from the best hyboria. my second, ukafa, and his kushite horde. remo and his shadow scouts from the jungles of zingara. and countless others. they all had a day like this one. they all chose a way forward.}
<A>__{into the forge walks cherin and akhun. the lieutenants stand behind corin, eyeing corin with malice. corin catches a glimpse of conan, buried but staring back at him, unable to move. corin quickly turns away, careful not to give his son away.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{what is it you want?}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{i seek neither gold nor steel, but flesh and blood. the last of a royal line that goes back three thousand years.}
<A>__{corin laughs.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{royalty in cimmeria? never. each man is free here.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{but i seek a woman.}
<A>__{khalar looks outside the door of the forge. the cimmerians women are being herded by the slavers.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{a queen in hiding. point her out and you'll spare the lives of your own. perhaps even your wife?}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{my wife was killed, long ago, by swine such as you.}
<A>__{khalar nods, understanding.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{then our stories began in the same place, cimmerian. i too lost my wife to marauders. how many men, in how many lands have suffered so? the only answer is power, strength unfettered, the kind of which can unite all hyboria under a single crown. that is the legacy i seek. will you join me?}
<A>__{it's a powerful, convincing speech. but corin holds his tongue, unmoved.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{very well. then death will be your story. your men will die. and your women too, when i am done with them. none will survive to carry your name forth, and over time, even your enemies will forget you ever were. you will be wiped from the pages of history.}
<P>__{(to his men)}
<D>__{take your blood, but leave the kill.}
<A>__{one by one, the lieutenants beat and stab corin, taking pleasure in his pain. conan struggles, trying to move, to yell, to do anything other than lie there. but a huge timber lies upon his back, pinning him to the ground.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{fariq! come!}
<A>__{entering the wrecked forge is fariq, the six year old son to khalar singh. he stares at corin's bleeding form with the dispassion of a sociopath. khalar picks up the sword corin and conan had forged together, the one corin took away. he admires it, then hands it to his son. he keeps a hand on it as it is too heavy for his son to lift alone. he instructs his son as if teaching him multiplication.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{before you lies our enemy. his tribe waits for him in the beyond. what would you do?}
<C>__{fariq}
<D>__{i would cut out his eyes, father, so that he will not find them. so he will wander the afterlife forever.}

<D>__{show me your strength, fariq. without it, you will never rule. with it, you will never be forgotten.}
<A>__{fariq drives the sword into corin's eye. corin doesn't make a sound. once fariq has ripped out corin's eyes, khalar runs corin through.}

<D>__{we'll slip in, along with those traders. but you'll need a change of clothes, those monks' robes will draw attention.}

<D>__{what will i wear?}
<L>__{exterior khor khalba entrance day}
<A>__{the caravan rides up to the walled entrance to the city, guarded by khalar's troops. blended in amongst the others, conan now wears the elaborate head scarf and clothes of shemish traders, obscuring all but his eyes.}

<C>__{conan}
<D>__{and what better disguise for a monk?}

<D>__{it's probably only way into khalar's fortress. i'm sure it is heavily guarded at all times, day and night.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{so we must try to scale the cliff.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{and dodge arrows as we do so?}
<A>__{conan motions up to the winch. standing beside it are a half dozen of the four armed archers.}
<C>__{conan }

<D>__{i think not.}

<A>__{a rundown hall, built beneath the city. wooden supports hold up the buildings of the entire city block overhead. and within the hall, a gathering of thieves and rogues. they're a flinty collection, many of them missing fingers or even hands, evidence of khalar's cruel justice. they eat and drink, sharing tales and tips, wenches and serving women their cautious eyes following the cimmerian outsider. the one eyed thief takes them to an open table, and immediately three of the serving women descend upon conan, caressing him. tamara watches this, jaw dropped, and manages a cough, even as a serving girl delivers mead to the table. conan just smiles as he enjoys the silky bodies of the nubile women, their breasts practically framing his face.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{what? do you wish to join in?}

<A>__{conan cleans mead from his face, scowling at tamara, as the one eyed thief uses the tabletop to explain the fortress.}

<D>__{so that's it?}
<C>__{one eyed thief}
<D>__{i didn't say that. i just said there's no known way in because no one has ever tried to. but breaking out that's another story. it's not much easier, but it's possible.}

<D>__{a warning. these catacombs are connected to the sea. it says that the beasts of acheron protect its secrets.}

<A>__{the catacomb widens out to a giant circular cistern, its walls rising up high into the darkness. as the torches bring light to the space, we see hundreds of dead, rotting bodies. as conan and tamara walk forward, the one eyed thief and the other stop at the entrance.}

<D>__{sorry, friend. we stop here. we've heard too much about what lies within to go any further.}
<A>__{conan simply nods and the thieves depart. conan raises his torch, illuminating the near wall.}

<D>__{where now?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{around. up.}
<A>__{conan heads off one direction, leaving tamara to navigate the other half. her torch illuminates the grizzly path ahead. she inhales deeply and takes her first step.}

<A>__{following the slick wall, he passes many dead bodies, but only one catches his eye. he stops before it.}
<B>__{dead warrior}
<A>__{nothing more than a skeleton, picked clean by the rats. but he still bears his leather armor, and a horned helmet that resembles his father's own. conan takes the helmet and places it on his head. it fits perfectly.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{something touched me. something slimy.}
<A>__{conan walks over, the torchlight revealing something on tamara's leg. it's a slug, which he flicks off.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{crom! stop wasting time.}
<A>__{but when conan steps forward, something roils the water right before him. he spots a huge tentacle just before its submerges back into the water.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{crom indeed.}
<A>__{then tamara screams as another tentacle rises up from the water, wrapping around her waist. tamara grabs hold of the wall as the tentacle tries to pull her underwater. conan immediately slashes the tentacle, pulling tamara away. the squirming decapitated tentacle squirts black blood everywhere, the knee high water seems to come alive with roiling intensity. conan spins, finding a circular stone staircase tiled into the far cistern wall.}

<A>__{carved out of solid black rock, both sides of the broad corridor are occasionally punctuated by thick steel doors, leading to prison cells. conan and tamara emerge from a sewer drain, pushing their way to the floor of the hallway. the heavy darkness presses in on conan's torch like a sentient, animate thing. the floor of the corridor is lined with dead bodies, in varying states of decay. there are buckets, filled with entrails and feces, upended. tamara put her hand over her mouth. conan continues down the hallway. he and tamara begin to hear the sound of eerie chanting.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{up ahead, the torch lined dungeon plunges into darkness as the torches end. conan holds up his own torch, struggling to peer into the black void.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{nothing good.}
<A>__{conan takes a step forward when suddenly a powerful wind blows out his torch. a moment later, there's the sound of a}

<C>__{conan }
<D>__{who dies first?}
<A>__{the first two combatants attack as one, the first wielding a short sword, the other a pike. the pikeman thrusts first, conan deftly stepping aside, then pulling the pike, sending the wielder off balance and into the abyss. the prisoner with the short sword doesn't fare much better, as conan evades his swipe and decapitates him with a single blow.}
<B>__{tamara}
<A>__{tamara sees that the prisoner baskets are suspended by the top half of the metallic cage. she begins scaling the cage, her eyes set upon the imprisoned monks.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{three more combatants step in to replace the fallen duo. conan readies himself as the first one steps up, only to have the combatant suddenly grabbed by a enormous tentacle, much like the one conan cut through earlier.}
<B>__{tentacled monster}
<A>__{up from the darkness of the pit comes a gargantuan monster; a gigantic octopus like behemoth, with multiple tentacles that feed a pulsing black orifice lined with razor sharp teeth. the creature reaches out and grabs another screaming combatants, lowering him to its mouth and devouring him in its gnashing maw. the creature reaches for conan, who ducks underneath the tentacle, the slices it off. he immediately turns back to check on tamara and he discovers she's not there. he looks up to see tamara scaling the cage, now nearly fifty feet directly above him.}

<A>__{conan barely dives out of the way as the fallen jailer smashes through the plank he was on, forcing conan to jump to another. just then another combatant comes swinging for the cimmerian, forcing him to defend while still not balanced.}

<A>__{the jailer drops tamara, who screams as she falls.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{conan spots tamara plunging towards him. in one swift move, he slashes his opponent, ducks underneath a writhing tentacle, and reaches out to grab tamara by the arm as she falls. his shoulder nearly pops out, but he manages to hold onto tamara.}
<B>__{tamara}
<A>__{she swings above the chasm, the gnashing teeth of the monster below her. only a single splintering plank holds her and conan aloft.}

<C>__{akhun }
<D>__{you'll make a nice meal.}
<A>__{akhun steps down on the plank one last time, but this time conan uses the momentum to springboard up into air. conan soars into the air, his cat like reflexes keeping him focused as he lands right before the stunned akhun. with one great slash of his blade, conan eviscerates akhun. akhun's innards drop out of his belly as he falls into the abyss, only to be snapped up by the massive beast.}

<A>__{khalar singh continues his chant and places the gold crown upon his head. as he does so, the light from the moon reflects off the crown, bathing the sacrificial pool in an unnatural glow. thump thump. a deep and foreboding sound echoes throughout the cave, shaking everything like an earthquake. it sounds like the heartbeat of a giant. khalar next places the iron crown around tamara's head. she thrashes and struggles but to no avail. once the crown is around her head thump thump! the spikes around the iron crown grow shorter as the spikes drive themselves into her head. she screams in agony. blood drips from beneath the crown, flowing into channels around the edges of the altar.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{it begins. you give birth to an empire.}
<L>__{exterior the side of the skull night}
<A>__{conan climbs muscles straining slipping hanging on by one hand and climbing again. thump thump. the statuary shakes, indeed the whole earth does. conan nearly slips, but keeps his grip.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{crom.}
<A>__{he reaches the eye of the skull.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{with the moon over his shoulder, conan stares down at the unholy sight before him. we pull back revealing tamara, her blood draining from her body.}
<L>__{interior acheron cave continuous}
<A>__{tamara, her face pale from blood loss, begins to pray in pained whispers.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{it's good that you pray. gods will be here soon.}
<A>__{tamara struggles to speak, her body wracked with pain.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{he'll be here sooner.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{me!}
<A>__{khalar turns to see the outline of conan, framed by the moonlight, looking down at khalar from atop of one the warrior statues. a thick vine dangles nearby, conan's route down from the cave roof above. conan then leaps down to the skeleton covered floor before the altar. it is a killing floor. the two guardsmen leap for him, but conan dispatches them with a pair of strikes. both fall down dead. conan meets tamara's eyes, a look of determination, assurance. he starts toward the altar.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{i will say this for you, barbarian. you are hard to kill.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{let her go.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{you've faced me before and lost. what do you think has changed now?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{my purpose.}
<A>__{conan lunges for khalar, their swords meeting with a flash of sparks. they fight to a brief standstill when thump,}
<B>__{thump. the altar}
<A>__{tamara writhes in pain as the spikes drive deeper into her head. more blood pours forth. the blood in the channels speeds up and finds the channel leading down to the sacrificial pool. conan makes another movement toward the altar, but khalar nimbly blocks his path.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{you are strong, cimmerian, but we both know you are not my equal.}
<A>__{conan takes the burlap sack wrapped at his hip pulls it off.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{once you used my father to teach your son a lesson about strength. now let me teach you.}
<A>__{conan tosses out what is inside. it falls to the ground, rolling to khalar singh's feet.}
<C>__{fariq's head}
<A>__{khalar looks down at the ground at the head of his beloved son, his eyes gone, replaced by molten metal. khalar trembles in shock and rage.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{khalar reaches for the severed head, giving conan a brief window to rush to tamara's side. conan tries to lift her off the altar, but the bone shackles still pin her down.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{cimmerian!!!}
<A>__{enraged, khalar charges conan throwing all his skill and force into an all out attack. conan simply sidesteps it, then shatters the bone shackle holding one of tamara's wrists. before he can shatter the other, khalar charges again. khalar swings, conan spins, his blade catching khalar's just inches from his face. conan throws khalar off him, knocking the warlord back ten feet. khalar's attack is feral, uncontrolled. he's lost his balance. spinning and striking blindly, conan smashes the second shackle on her wrist. he continues his motion, bringing his sword around to meet khalar's next strike. now khalar looks like the enraged amateur, and conan the more polished warrior. their battle takes them away from the altar. with her hands free, tamara struggles to pull the spikes out and remove the crown.}
<B>__{the killing floor}
<A>__{conan repels another khalar attack, this time striking khalar's chest and drawing blood. the guardsmen arrive from the other side of the cave, drawing their swords. khalar waves them off, his fury aimed at the cimmerian.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{the queen. shackle her!}
<B>__{the altar}
<A>__{in agony, tamara pulls one of the spikes out, then another. she pushes with all her might, lifting the crown of iron off her bloodied head when the guardsmen charge her, pin her down, and force the crown back on. thump, thump! the crown spikes imbed themselves even deeper as tamara screams. the blood now fills the channels of the altar. we follow the trail of blood, down the side of the altar, in a spiral channel around the leg, and in a wide circle around the altar until reaching the channel's end the first drop of tamara's blood touches the sacrificial pool. it boils instantly, multiplying itself exponentially, bubbling forth and filling the entire pool. and all hell breaks loose. a massive earthquake jolts the entire cave.}
<B>__{the killing floor}
<A>__{as khalar singh and conan battle, the ground beneath them on the wide cave floor cracks and splinters. thump thump! the earthquake intensifies and the entire floor of the cave gives way, tumbling into an incredible abyss. conan and khalar alike grab onto the only rocks they can reach to prevent them from falling further. conan ends up against one of the walls on the side of the cave. khalar clings to the rocks on the edge of the sacred pool. their bodies are illuminated by a fiery glow. they look below, searching for the source of the glow.}
<B>__{acheron}
<A>__{another two hundred feet deep lies the golden spired city of ancient acheron. the cave is but a forechamber, the slightest taste of the true glory and horror of acheron. and as they stare down into the ancient city, the shadows there move. is it a trick of the light? no. whatever the dark forms are, they are coming this way, climbing the tallest demonic spires and leaping impossibly far to climb up after conan and khalar singh. khalar gazes down at the city with wide eyes.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{beyond my dreams }
<B>__{the altar}
<A>__{tamara, her body's blood nearly drained, is still shackled to the altar, which now teeters over the edge of chasm, poised to fall into the fiery depths.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{conan!!!}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{on the other side of the abyss, conan spots her and scales the cave wall, up to a tiered plateau. he moves quickly, trying to get to tamara.}
<B>__{khalar singh}
<A>__{khalar watches, entranced, as the first of the creatures rises out of the pit. they climb the walls like insects, clinging to the walls, their heads swiveling like a praying mantis.}
<B>__{acheronian warriors}
<A>__{the look like the statues above a hybrid part human, part demon. their skin is a perfect black, armor carved of black bone, faces once human but now demonic with blood red eyes and gnashing teeth. they advance on khalar singh, who is furthest down now that conan climbs upward towards tamara.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<P>__{(in acheronian)}
<D>__{i am khalar singh, king of acheron. i command you to kneel!}
<A>__{and this demonic horde advances right for him, their razor sharp teeth bared. unsure, khalar grips his tulwars tight. the demonic creatures draw close, and they kneel. they climb out of the abyss and immediately lower their heads before khalar singh. out of the corner of his eye, khalar spots conan, drawing near.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<P>__{(in acheronian)}
<D>__{show him the might of the army of acheron!}
<A>__{but they do not rush to follow the order. they stir. one of them with more ornate bone armor than the rest looks over at khalar's guardsmen.}
<C>__{acheronian commander}
<P>__{(in acheronian)}
<D>__{first, we feed.}
<A>__{its voice is somewhere between a whisper and a hiss.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{fine. take your fill. i will kill him myself.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{conan is on an intercept course with tamara, leaping across chasms from statue to statue. just below him, the first wave of acheronian warriors reach the khalar's remaining guardsmen.}
<C>__{khalar's guardsmen}
<A>__{khalar's guardsmen, who have been watching the events with mouths agape, realize the danger too late. the horde of acheronian warriors leaps on them and a massive battle ensues between the demonic warriors and the soldiers.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{his climbing is dizzying, reminiscent of his youth scaling the cliffs of cimmeria.}
<B>__{khalar}
<A>__{intercepts conan just below the altar, his tulwars at the ready.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{your story ends here.}
<A>__{the two warriors square off, fighting even as they cling to the statues.}
<B>__{acheronian warriors}
<A>__{the demon warriors not only slay khalar's guardsmen, but rip their still living bodies apart, dousing themselves in the blood of their victims. it is a violent ritual, both bacchantic and gruesome.}
<B>__{khalar}
<A>__{launches himself at conan, his tulwars sparking off the stone statuary. conan leaps to another statue, parrying the blows. khalar overextends himself, and conan's sword just barely misses his throat. khalar pulls back, tries to settle himself. conan's eyes narrow, he knows what khalar is doing.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{like a woman, fariq cried and begged me to spare him.}
<A>__{khalar roars in rage, launching an all out offensive. conan backs up slowly, waiting for his moment. and it comes quickly. conan ducks below the tulwars and cuts khalar across the stomach. khalar loses his balance and falls, one hand grabbing a protruding statue arm, dangling over the abyss. conan raises his sword to finish the job.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{conan!!!}
<A>__{conan glances down. the acheronian commander drank his fill, and now moves to the altar itself, his claw stroking tamara's body. with one touch, the shackles open. he and the acheronian warriors drag her pale body toward the abyss. khalar grins up at him through bloody teeth.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{they take her to a place you can never follow. who will you fail, cimmerian? your father or your woman?}
<A>__{conan leaps down to the altar. the acheronian warriors attack. standing atop the altar, conan cuts down all comers, cutting his way through the enemy, working his way to tamara.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{tamara!!}
<A>__{they leap on conan, impossibly fast. they stab him. they cut him. but he does not stop. even wounded, he throws them into the abyss. and he reaches tamara, just before the commander drags her below. he grabs her arm. the commander grabs her other arm, baring his shark like teeth. blam! conan punches him in the mouth with his free hand and the commander falls into the abyss. the bloody conan pulls tamara up into his arms. only for tamara to scream.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{conan!}
<A>__{conan spins just in time as khalar strikes. khalar's tulwar narrowly misses, and conan counters. his father's sword runs khalar singh through. khalar's body falls into the abyss. but the acheronian warriors surround them. thousands climb out of the abyss, teeth bared, closing in on the wounded conan. tamara, badly weakened herself, grabs conan.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{conan, you know what you must do. kill me.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{it is the only way to end this. my death gives others life.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i cannot.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{you must. your parents both understood that purpose. now it is yours. live, conan.}
<A>__{a tear falls from tamara's face. the demonic warriors prepare to strike. conan drives his sword into tamara's heart. the crown spikes retract and it falls from her head, tumbling into the abyss. boom! a seismic explosion shakes everything, an unearthly gust of wind pulling the acheronian warriors back down into the abyss.}
<B>__{acheronian cave}
<A>__{the cave begins to fall, massive sections of the roof dropping in to decimate the pyramid and the city below.}
<B>__{altar}
<A>__{conan pulls tamara's body away, even as the world descends into dust and debris.}
<L>__{exterior cave entrance night}
<A>__{khalar's horse stands near the entrance. conan puts tamara's body carefully atop the horse, then mounts it himself. he positions her in front of him, his arms encircling her. conan gives her lifeless body one last kiss, her blood staining his lips red, as his mother's did as a child.}
<L>__{exterior high plateau dawn}
<A>__{a blazing sun threatens to explode over the nearby mountains. conan holds a single torch in his hand. his look is hard. grim. we pull back to reveal a funeral pyre, tamara's body atop it. conan places the torch to the pyre. it quickly spreads. we move in, closer and closer upon conan's ice blue eyes, a blazing fire erupting in them. a fire that will never be extinguished.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{live, conan. live.}
