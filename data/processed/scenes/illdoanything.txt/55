<A>__{a devil's weight lifted from his shoulders. the slap happy smile of the just saved plastered on his face.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{your little boy fell, so he's screaming. and you want her to stay.}
<A>__{lucy, confused by his buoyant reaction, nods.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{okay. seven dollars an hour?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{great. thank you. see you later, jeannie.}
<A>__{he tries to kiss her, but she shuns him. lucy, now having an official status, turns to admonish her.}
