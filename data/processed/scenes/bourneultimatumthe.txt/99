<A>__{paz moving deliberately through the evening rush hour blending in... bourne in pursuit. chasing on instinct. there...a glimpse of paz at the bottom of an escalator. bourne fights past people. paz disappears into the crowd. bourne rushes to catch him. rounding a corner... a long walkway at the end, two staircases lead to different tube lines. bourne hesitates measures the choice. the sound of a train fills the station bourne fast downstairs. watches just as paz gets onto the car at another door. bourne lunges to get on the train...but the doors close... bourne's pov watching paz from the platform as he sags down onto a seat, nauseated, his skin clammy, his head pounding...he takes out the pills and dry swallows them...looks up... close on bourne watching paz...as if he's looking in the mirror at his old self...the self before the bourne identity... close on paz he looks straight ahead, just another commuter... back on bourne watching paz, as the train pulls away...then bourne is immediately in motion...}
