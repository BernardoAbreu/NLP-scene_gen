<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i don't know, dupree... i don't know...}
<A>__{dupree pours rye whiskey into a water glass in front of mouse, who swallows half the shot without looking up from his plate of food. easy declines when the bottle comes his way, feeling the pressure of time running out.}

<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{it's all right, big man... it's all right...}
<A>__{and he pours dupree a half glass of rye. the bottle later, night barely a "corner" of whiskey lies at the bottom and dupree is snoring like a buzzsaw, sound asleep. mouse squints into his glass, wondering why it's empty, and looks down the length of the kitchen leading into the bedroom night drawers are pulled out on the dresser, and easy is rifling through another until he pulls out a bible. he fans the pages, finding}
<B>__{the letter}
<A>__{already opened. his fingers pull out a photograph and then two more.}
<B>__{back to easy}
<A>__{his excited face goes sick, and he silently mouths:}

<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i got it. come on, i think that girl is gonna call again.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{that dupree is a good man, but he sure can't hold his liquor.}
<A>__{easy grabs his coat off a chair and starts to put it on, stuffing the letter in his coat pocket.}
<C>__{easy}

<D>__{ain't a man in texas can outdraw me!}
<C>__{easy}
<P>__{(forced calm)}

<D>__{i don't have a gun, raymond. come on, let's go.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{you fool enough to go without a piece then you must wanna be dead.}
<A>__{he lays the pistol on the table then draws a .32 automatic from his waist, this time cocking the hammer, the muzzle only inches from easy's head. easy can tell from the glazed look in mouse's eye that instead of seeing him, his friend is glaring at some demon he carries around in his head. so he stands stock still.}
<C>__{easy}
<P>__{(quiet, soothing)}
<D>__{let him go, raymond... he done learned his lesson. if you kill him then he won't have got it.}
<C>__{mouse}

<D>__{let him live, raymond, and he be scared whenever you walk in the room.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{motherfucker better be scared. i kill a motherfucker. i kill him!}
<A>__{easy stares down the barrel of the gun for a long moment until mouse blinks, then nods and lets the pistol fall down into his lap. his head on his chest, he's sound asleep. easy takes the gun and puts it on the table with the other. then walks to the doorway and turns out the light.}
