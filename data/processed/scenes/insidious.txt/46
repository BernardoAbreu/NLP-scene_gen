<D>__{i heard something coming from cali's room. a man's voice. on the baby monitor...it scared the hell outta me. i went in there and no one was there.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{could it have been interference?}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{i don't know. it was so clear. i was sitting at the piano and i heard this...whispering on the baby monitor. so i held my ear up to it }
<A>__{suddenly a noise interrupts. an arrhythmic knocking sound, like a drunk pounding on a tavern door after closing. it is the front door.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{who the hell is that?}
<A>__{josh knows it's his job to check, but he doesn't want to.}
