<A>__{his gang burst to their feet. they scramble through the dunes, heading for their bikes. a helicopter, seen only by its massively strong search lamp, and the wind from its rotors blowing sand everywhere, flies up and over the dunes, buzzing the running pack, blowing some off their feet. gregory mounts his bike and chandra jumps on back. with a wave of his hand, all the bikes, his included, drop into neutral and rev into start. their headlights blaze as the helicopter returns, joined by another.}

<D>__{this is the police, stop your vehicles and surrender!}
<A>__{suddenly, automatic fire sparks from the unseen helicopters. a bullet trail stitches its way across a pair of bikers, sending them to the ground as the helicopters fly overhead. gregory cranks down on the throttle and his bike explodes ahead.}
