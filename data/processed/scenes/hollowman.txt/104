<A>__{sebastian paces back and forth, glancing at the camera.}
<L>__{interior laboratory day}
<A>__{linda, matt and sebastian, in latex and scrubs, stare at an electron microscope's video display. on the screen in a sparse colony of blood calls but every second more and more cells appear, filling the gap.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{60% reversion. 70% ... 75% ... 80% ... 85 ...}
<A>__{the others in the lab listen. they start to get excited. janice and carter leave their research and come over to watch the screen.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{we've got it. we've got it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{93% ... 95%... 95%}
<A>__{they wait. linda points to a blank patch on the screen.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{that's all we need.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{come on, baby. come on.}
<A>__{but the blood cells nearest the blank patch twinkle out existence, and then those around them also blink away until after a beat, the screen is empty.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{full quantum cascade at 95%.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you're sorry? you're fucking sorry?}
<A>__{sebastian picks up a glass beaker and hurls it against the wall. it shatters.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{six weeks of this shit and you're sorry!}
<A>__{he grabs more equipment and begins tossing it in a rage. carter and janice grab him and restrain him. after struggling against them a beat or two, sebastian calms down and pushes away from them and heads out the door.}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{i don't blame him.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i will go talk to him.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{leave him alone. he just needs to blow off some steam.}
