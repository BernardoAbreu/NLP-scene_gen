<L>__{exterior shop day}
<A>__{jill, in street, on verge of tears... moves to her car... gets in... sits for a long moment.}
<L>__{exterior office building day}
<A>__{george on bike pulls into office building. the music over is jefferson airplane's "white rabbit."}
<L>__{interior lester's office day}
<A>__{in his inner office. lester's on the telephone, staring out the window.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{look, kurt, i don't care where you have to go. i want beluga caviar there. call jurgenson's, call chasen's... i don't care how much it costs... how much?... then spend it. just make sure it's there. you've got all the money in the world to buy it. you understand? just make sure it's there on the table tonight.}
<P>__{(he hangs up)}
<D>__{jesus.}
<P>__{(to george, to no one)}
<D>__{you've got to do everything yourself. you know?}
<A>__{suddenly lester gives george a steely look. it covers his hair, his clothes. george is acutely uncomfortable.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, yeah.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{she says you're a fabulous hairdresser.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i didn't say it, she did. how'd you happen to get in that line of work?}
<A>__{george sort of knows what lester's driving at.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, well, i went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{long pause. george hasn't told lester what he wants to know.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{it's an unusual trade.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes it is.}
<A>__{an awkward pause.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{but the important thing is you're successful at it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{in a way. but...}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{but what?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm better than the guy i work for.}
<A>__{this seems to interest lester.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{well, george, i invest for a lot of people. i make a lot of money for them. more than they could do for themselves.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{after a while that hurts... doesn't it?}
<A>__{lester smiles. he appreciates this.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{it's good you want to do something, george.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{but personal services are not the kind of thing i usually get into.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{they're not?}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(suddenly direct, almost enthusiastic)}
<D>__{no, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. it's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am i right or am i right?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you're right.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{who needs that kind of aggravation? who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? when i finish work i want to...}
<A>__{the door bursts open. it's one of the secretaries.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{mr. karpf...}
<A>__{jackie is right behind her. she bounces in, not seeing george.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'm sorry but i need an extra garage key.}
<A>__{in lester's presence she seems distinctly younger than she did with jill. she's startled when she sees george.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{what for? what do you need the key for?}
<A>__{jackie continues to stare at george.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{the man from sloan's is coming. i called you about it.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{how did you lose that key? oh, george, this is uh miss this is jackie.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{oh, hi, i mean hello, we've met.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(a little suspiciously)}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(almost immediately on the defensive)}
<D>__{well, yes, george is a wonderful hairdresser.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{is that right?}
<A>__{awkward pause.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{so how's norman?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{great. who's been doing your hair?}
<A>__{jackie glances at lester.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i go to the blue'n gold barber shop in westwood. the guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{george is going to open a shop.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(really interested)}
<D>__{no kidding? your own shop?}
<A>__{george starts to say yes.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{george, could you excuse us for a minute?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{he leaves the office, shuts the door, leaving jackie and lester alone. lester shuts the door.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i called to tell you i was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i am?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{who were you talking to?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{who do you think i was talking to?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{my secretary saw you with that boy.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{steve?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{whatever his name is, that actor.}
<A>__{jackie looks for a moment as if she's going to get very emotional.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{steve slutes, and he's not a boy.}
<P>__{(a touch bitter)}
<D>__{steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. he couldn't get arrested as a boy.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{then you were talking to him.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i ran into him at the 76 station on little santa monica, what was i supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? yes, i was talking to him.}
<A>__{lester's a little chagrined now but not much.}
<C>__{jackie }
<P>__{(an outburst)}
<D>__{i'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, i can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. you're driving me up the wall, lester. you're even jealous of the dogs. i mean i've gotta have somebody i can talk to.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i'm not jealous of the dogs.}
<A>__{jackie looks at him in disgust.}
<C>__{lester }
<P>__{(very positive)}
<D>__{now listen, jackie, i'm not jealous of anybody, i just can't afford to get caught... off base.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{so i can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, i'm going to tell him i'm screwing lester karpf!}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{of course not.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's not very logical, lester.}
