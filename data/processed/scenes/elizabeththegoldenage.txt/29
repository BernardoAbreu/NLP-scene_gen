<L>__{interior great hall, whitehall palace day}
<A>__{elizabeth sits sumptuously gowned and jewelled at an ornately dressed dining table, surrounded by her ladies, bess among them; walsingham discreetly in the background. they're listening to a young austrian make a formal speech of love. the austrian ambassador stands to one side, mouthing the words to prompt him. the archduke charles is still a boy: sixteen years old, slight, pale, trembling with shyness. he struggles through his rehearsed speech.}
<C>__{archduke charles}
<D>__{your majesty's beauty is dazzling to my eyes. your learning is famed throughout europe. i see before me perfection in human form. oh, elizabeth! how blessed am i to stand in your fabled presence, warmed by your greatness as by the rays of the sun. oh elizabeth! to speak your name is to hear celestial music. may that sweet sound guide me through my life to come elizabeth! elizabeth! i have travelled here, to this illustrious court, in the hope that our two great nations might be joined in love. but now that i am bathed in the radiance of your glory, i am overwhelmed. i am conquered. i die. only your love, great elizabeth, can restore me to life.}
<A>__{courtiers exchange smiles at his efforts. the spaniards sneer openly. but elizabeth takes the charade with due gravity.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{your highness does me great honour. shall we eat our dinner? it should prove almost as restorative as my love.}
<A>__{raleigh enters the great hall, trailed by calley, as the dinner gets under way. they join the much larger group who simply stand and watch. royal meals are in part a spectacle for the court. a jester moves from group to group, playing pranks on the guests. raleigh is now dressed in court fashion, and looks very well; as the glances of several court ladies show. he catches bess's eye and they share a smile.}
<C>__{court lady}
<D>__{so tell me, mr raleigh, in your sea battles how do you sink an enemy ship? you shoot holes in its sides, i suppose.}
<P>__{(}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{no, ma'am. a sunk ship is of no value. the object is to capture and command.}
<C>__{court lady}
<D>__{and how do you do that?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{surprise. speed. irresistible violence.}
<A>__{calley, listening, rolls his eyes. elizabeth, at the table with the archduke by her side, glances towards raleigh, and sees him flirting with the court ladies. then back to the young archduke, who has hardly touched his food.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i think you're not as accustomed as i am to eating in public. i have a secret.}
<P>__{lowering her voice)}
<D>__{i pretend there's a pane of glass eine glasscheibe between me and them.}
<A>__{she moves one hand before her face, indicating an imaginary pane of glass. as she looks, she sees bess staring at someone follows her gaze and is amused to find that the object of her attention is also raleigh.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{they can see me, but they can't hear me, or touch me. you should try it.}
<A>__{she beckons to bess.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{bess.}
<A>__{bess comes forward.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{he interests me. talk to him.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{him, my lady?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{him.}
<A>__{bess turns and looks across towards raleigh, as he flirts with the court ladies. elizabeth turns back to her guest.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{his highness is tired after his journey.}
<A>__{the young archduke, frozen with shyness, sits staring before him, trembling as he frames a proper reply.}
<C>__{archduke charles}
<D>__{no man can be tired in the presence of so lovely a queen.}
<A>__{elizabeth speaks so only he can hear, in german.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(you play the game very well, my}
<D>__{young friend. but don't you sometimes feel an overwhelming desire to say what you're really}
<P>__{thinking?)}
<A>__{the archduke's eyes open very wide. he glances at elizabeth, and sees on her face a conspiratorial smile.}
<C>__{archduke charles}
<P>__{(i daren't even think what i'm really thinking.)}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(you're thinking, perhaps, that you would far rather be home.)}
<C>__{archduke charles}
<P>__{(you're very wise, madame.)}
<A>__{he's grateful to her, and his shy face shows it. raleigh is still being entertained by the court ladies.}
<C>__{court lady}
<D>__{i adore the natives you brought back with you. i don't suppose you could get one for me? they're not dangerous, are they?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{that depends what you propose to do with them.}
<C>__{court lady}
<D>__{i'd dress him up in mulberry coloured silk and have him walk behind me, carrying my cloak.}
<A>__{bess has now approached raleigh.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{the pirate is not too bored by the vanities of the court, i hope.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{a simple sailor, dazzled by the bright lights.}
<A>__{bess draws him away from the court ladies.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{if you can bring yourself to leave the dazzle of the bright lights for a moment }
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{drawn away by the brightest light of all.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{that can only mean the queen.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{i don't presume to raise my eyes so high.}
<A>__{they both look at the queen. she's watching raleigh. he bows.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{it seems you've presumed after all.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{it seems you're determined to think the worst of me.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{tell me what it is you really want.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{what every man wants. money. fame. love.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{in that order?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{each leads to the nexterior the money will buy and equip ships for a return voyage to the new world. the success of my infant colony there will make me famous. the fame will bring me love.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{it seems rather a long way round.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{there are benefits along the way. it is something, after all, to take a blank on the map and build there a shining city.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{which you will no doubt name after yourself.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{no doubt.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{well, then. i am answered.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{may i ask a question in return?}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{how am i to win the queen's favour?}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{why should i tell you that, sir?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{i've little enough to offer, i know. but whatever i have to give ask, and it's yours.}
<A>__{bess thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{my advice to you is, say what you mean to say as plainly as possible. all men flatter the queen in the hope of advancement. pay her the compliment of truth.}
<A>__{she gives him her hand. he kisses it.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{i don't even know your name.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{elizabeth throckmorton.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{a second elizabeth.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{everyone calls me bess.}
<A>__{she goes back to the queen, as elizabeth is rising to leave. she speaks to the company.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{his highness the archduke informs me that my charms overwhelm him. he will retire to his private quarters to rest.}
<A>__{this causes much amusement. don guerau sneers openly. the archduke rises. all rise. the archduke bows solemnly to the queen, and leaves with his entourage. elizabeth beckons to walsingham, and speaks low to him.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{he's a sweet boy. i don't want him hurt by your schemes.}
