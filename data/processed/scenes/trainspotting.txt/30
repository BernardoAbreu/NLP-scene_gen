<L>__{interior office. day}
<A>__{the same office. the same team are interviewing spud.}
<C>__{spud}
<D>__{no, actually i went to craignewton but i was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so i put the royal edinburgh college instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and i wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? people get all hung up on details, but what's the point? like which school? does it matter? why? when? where? or how many o grades did i get? could be six, could be one, but that's not important. what's important is that i am, right? that i am.}
<C>__{man 1}
<D>__{mr. murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?}
<C>__{spud}
<D>__{only to get my foot in the door. showing initiative, right?}
<C>__{man 1}
<D>__{you were referred here by the department of employment. there's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.}
<C>__{spud}
<D>__{hey. right. no problem. whatever you say, man. you're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. i'm merely here. but obviously i am. here, that is. i hope i'm not talking too much. i don't usually. i think it's all important though, isn't it?}

<C>__{woman}
<D>__{homeless people?}
<C>__{spud}
<D>__{no, not homeless people. beggars, francis begbie one of my mates. i wouldn't say my best mate, i mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we me and him were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right }
<A>__{ }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{mr. murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?}
<C>__{spud}
<D>__{no. well, yes. i have to admit it: i'm a perfectionist. for me, it's the best or nothing at all. if things go badly, i can't be bothered, but i have a good feeling about this interview. seems to me like it's gone pretty well. we've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.}
