<A>__{a convertible is driving along a desert road. long shots of the automobile driving are filmed in bright sunlight. the desert hills are clearly visible in the background, with only a slight darkening to suggest day for night, but the car's headlights are on so we clearly understand that it is pitch black in the dead of night.}

<A>__{medium shot bob and shirley in car. night bob and shirley are seated in the convertible, driving through the night, on a "date". they are searching for an ancient cemetery. medium shots have a pitch black background and dark shadows across the car. shirley is leaning over in her seat toward bob, who is driving.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{we sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery. let's turn back.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{no. it's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{but does it have to be in a cemetery?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you wouldn't understand. seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{but there're so many wonderful things to write about, bob.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{sure there are and i've tried them all. plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories. huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about }
<C>__{shirley}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{but horror stories! why all the time horror stories?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{shirley, i wrote for years without selling a single word.}
<A>__{bob lets go of the wheel with his right arm and puts it around shirley, who leans closer against him.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{my monsters have done well for me. you think i'd give that up just so i could write about trees, or dogs, or daisies? huhuh daisies! that's it, i will write about my creatures who are pushing up the daisies.}
<A>__{shirley looks up at bob and smiles. he tilts his head down and they kiss.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{that's life. my kisses are alive.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{who's to say my monsters aren't alive?}
<A>__{long shot of the car driving down the road}
