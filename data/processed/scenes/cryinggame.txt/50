<L>__{exterior street night.}
<A>__{dave walking, holding dil by the arm. the street is dilapidated, full of squats. they stop outside a door. dil opens the door with a key from her purse and they both walk inside. fergus stands there, observing. a light comes on in an upstairs room. dil enters; we see her shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of dave coming in behind her. he begins to remove her blouse. she stands absolutely still as he does so. fergus backs away, then walks off.}
