<L>__{exterior seine bateau mouche night}
<A>__{a searchlight near the boat's bridge has gone on and now begins sweeping the river banks. on benches by the water's edge, lovers are surprised by the bright light which suddenly and without warning discovers them in various attitudes of mutual affection. some are embarrassed, some are amused and some (the most intimate) damn annoyed. one even shakes his fist at the light. med. shot reggie and adam who, like everyone else, leave the table and stand together at the rail watching.}
