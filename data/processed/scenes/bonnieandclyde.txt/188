<D>__{he was shot in too many pieces to pick off the ground! fled...what do they know, the papers or the police?...}
<A>__{suddenly he moves upon malcolm with enormous intent, as if by pounding the point home to the one relative stranger among them, he will justify it all. malcolm momentarily flinches, then listens with intense deference.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{why, while we were all lyin' around here, near dead, they had us holdin' up the grand prairie national bank! they hung that one on us just for luck, i guess.}

<D>__{tell you what. soon's we get well, we're gonna take that bank!}
<A>__{he breaks into a wicked grin, but then reels, catching himself on the porch railing. he's obviously dizzy from exertion and anger. bonnie starts then sees clyde is in control.}
