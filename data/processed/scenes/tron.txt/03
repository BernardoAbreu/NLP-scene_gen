<B>__{real world}
<A>__{screen of a video game, the real world version of light cycles, as we see one of the lines smash into another and disappear.}
<B>__{the real world}
<A>__{we see teenagers, strangely lit from below with bluish light, their hands on electronic controls, levers, knobs. we hear electronic beeping and popping.}
<B>__{electronic world}
<A>__{futuristic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat grid like landscape. one fires, and the other disappears when it is hit, to reappear, spinning wildly, in the distance. we hear a sound like a crack of lightning.}
<B>__{real world}
<A>__{a video game in an arcade. on the screen is a typical version of tank wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a 2 d maze.}
<B>__{electronic world}
<A>__{two other game warriors on the grid, this time throwing glowing disks at one another like frisbees. we see the one colored blue throw; his disk smashes into the second warrior, and he dissolves into thousands of glowing lines.}
<B>__{real world}
<A>__{a video game called "berserk," in which a human character' throws a glowing dot at monsters in a maze; we see a quick glimpse of the screen, then cut to a group of people staring down, laughing.}
<B>__{electronic world}
<A>__{another game in progress, from a long shot. a version of jai alai, in which the two players stand suspended in space on glowing colored rings, and throw a pellet of solid energy at each other.}
<B>__{angle on one of the warriors}
<A>__{he is huge, evil looking. his body is enormous, his head mechanical. this is sark. he glows ominously blue. he is catching the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller, glowing yellow. close up face of the opponent fearful, nervous, poised on one ring.}
<B>__{sark}
<A>__{sneering, as he uses his electronic cesta to hurl the pellet back with violent force.}
<B>__{the smaller warrior}
<A>__{desperately trying to catch the pellet, but it smashes into the ring, which explodes into a million pieces. one last glimpse of the yellow warrior's tortured, desperate face as he falls to instant death.}
<B>__{sark}
<A>__{triumphant, laughing. high above him, etched in enormous glowing computer printed 3 d block letters, are the words:}
<D>__{"winner: blue sark!!"}
<C>__{boy's voice}
<P>__{(distant, echoing)}
<D>__{aagh! god, lisa, i almost had you that time.}
