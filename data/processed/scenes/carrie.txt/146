<L>__{exterior athletic field day}
<A>__{sue sits in the bleachers overlooking the field. she is preoccupied, still shaken by the afternoon's confrontation with chris. the track team is moving past the bleachers (a coach in the field clocking them and shouting orders). tommy, in his track uniform, peels away from the group and comes running up to sue.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{hi!}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{i want to talk to you.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{sure, what's up?}
<A>__{to avoid the noise of the cheerleaders practicing down in front of them, and the other girls sitting in the bleachers half watching their boyfriends and half eyeing tommy and sue, sue beckons tommy to follow her away from the group behind the bleachers, and as they walk off together we hear the following:}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{if i asked you to do something for me something special would you?}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{no matter how crazy it sounded?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{sure. what?}
<A>__{the sound is muffled, and we don't hear what she says. but we do hear:}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(continuing; exploding)}
<D>__{are you out of your mind?}
