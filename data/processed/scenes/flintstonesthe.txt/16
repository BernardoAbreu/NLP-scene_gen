<L>__{interior butcher shop day}
<A>__{it's absolutely mobbed. customers push past each other with armloads of food. gigantic cuts of meat hang from above or are on display behind the counter. morris the butcher looks up from the chaos and manages a weak smile for the girls.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{morris, what on earth is going on? you giving away bronto filets?}
<C>__{morris}
<D>__{ah, my two loveliest customers. it's this darn kibble crisis, mrs. r... people are buying everything i got to feed their dinos...}
<C>__{mrs. slate}
<D>__{young man, if you're through flirting, i'd like some service.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{revealing mrs. slate, who stands there, impatient and overdressed.}
<C>__{morris}
<D>__{of course, mrs. slate. just take a number.}
<A>__{wilma senses the tension, quickly steps forward to break it with a smile.}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{ah, hello, mrs. slate.}
<A>__{morris reacts with relief. mrs. slate reacts with a blank look.}
<C>__{wilma}
<P>__{(prompting)}
<D>__{we met at the quarry picnic?}
<C>__{mrs. slate}
<D>__{oh, of course. mrs. flintstein.}
<A>__{she turns her back to wilma, forces her way towards the counter again. wilma burns.}
<C>__{morris}
<D>__{ladies, the meat's not getting any fresher. mrs. r, what'll it be?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh, i'd like some ground mammoth patties and uh... some dodo drumsticks.}
<C>__{morris}
<D>__{gino? we got any dodo bird?}
<A>__{gino turns, looks at his end of the counter.}
<C>__{gino}
<D>__{there's one left and it's the last one!}
<C>__{morris}
<D>__{good.}
<P>__{(handing him the note)}
<D>__{give it to mrs. rubble along with this.}
<A>__{gino nods, smiling. he picks up a crate, begins to load it with giant fryer parts and several manhole sized meat patties.}
<C>__{morris}
<P>__{(turning to betty)}
<D>__{how about you, mrs. f?}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{i just need a few things for fred.}
<C>__{morris}
<D>__{'fred...'?}
<P>__{(calling into the back)}
<D>__{david! herman! get rob and bobo and tell 'em to bring the big dolly!}
<C>__{voice from back }
<D>__{flintstone again, huh?}
<C>__{morris}
<D>__{you got it. now then... mrs. slate?}
<P>__{(pointing at the}
<D>__{limo outside the}
<P>__{shop)}
<D>__{you're in a no parking zone there.}
<C>__{mrs. slate}
<D>__{well, if i get some service, i will be out of it, won't i?}
<A>__{mrs. slate steps to the counter. meanwhile, the staff begin using a refrigerator dolly to bring out giant ribs, steaks and sausages which they pile up in front of wilma.}
<C>__{mrs. slate}
<D>__{i want a nice fresh, juicy chickensaurus, morris. and not one you've had laying around on the shelf. i mean fresh.}
<C>__{morris}
<D>__{mrs. slate, we're kind of busy now }
<C>__{mrs. slate}
<D>__{i don't care if you're busy. what i care about is my adorable little grand nephew. he's staying with me for the summer and i intend to make his favorite dish... southern fried chickensaurus! now i want a fresh chickensaurus and i want it now!}
<C>__{morris}
<D>__{boys, you heard her... she said fresh.}
<B>__{the staff}
<A>__{with a sigh, they buckle on elbow and knee protectors, go to a side door, open it. inside is another barred door. they open it, go inside. immediately we hear loud squawking and cackling... thuds, bumps...}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{suddenly the barred door slams open and a giant chicken saurus comes bounding out, with morris's staff hanging all over it like rodeo cowboys. they try and restrain it with ropes but it's enraged and flops around the store.}
<C>__{mrs. slate}
<P>__{(oblivious of the trouble)}
<D>__{morris, while you're at it, i'd like it plucked }
<A>__{suddenly the chickensaurus snaps the ropes, flaps its wings and leaps through the front window }
