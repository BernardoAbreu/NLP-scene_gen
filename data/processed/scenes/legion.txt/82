<A>__{amidst the dirt and darkness, charlie lets out a final agonizing scream... ...and then comes a baby's cries. audrey, eyes wide, holds up the child. stunned. elated.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{oh my god...we did it! charlie, you did it!}
<A>__{audrey places the child in charlie's arms. she stares at the baby, holding it at a distance, unsure of whether to embrace it or be terrified by it. a commitment she's not yet ready to make, even at this late hour.}
<C>__{audrey}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{it's okay. the baby's okay.}
<A>__{charlie looks to audrey, tears streaming down her face.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't...i...}
<A>__{audrey looks to michael, unsure.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{take him... give her a minute.}
<A>__{audrey nods, takes the baby back from charlie, tries to soothe him by pacing around the diner.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{it's okay...it's okay...shhh...}
<A>__{another drone of the horn rattles the walls. menacing. closer. audrey reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio, trying to drown out the sound of the approaching menace. out of the static, the haunting sounds of bing crosby singing silent night fills the room. the quiet before the storm. michael helps charlie quickly clean herself up. she stares at him, a burning spite in her eyes.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{so are we safe now? is it over?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no. killing the child would have ended the war before it had begun. now, at least, he will have a chance to grow up, a chance to lead the world out of darkness.}
<A>__{those words provide her little comfort.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and what happens until then...?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you'll need to teach him how.}
<A>__{charlie shakes her head, this is all too much.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what makes you think i can do that? what makes you think i want to do that? if he's so important, why don't you take him?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{each of us has a burden. this one is yours and yours alone. maybe someday you'll understand what that means.}
<A>__{off charlie's look, we move across the diner where audrey approaches her mother, kneels down in front of her. despite how much her mother pisses her off, it breaks her heart to see her in such a demoralized state.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{mama? can you hear me?}
<P>__{(holds up the baby)}
<D>__{we did it...the baby's alive.}
<C>__{audrey }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{mama?}
<A>__{if sandra hears her daughter, it doesn't show in her face. tears well up in audrey's eyes as she moves away from her mother. but we hold here and... drift down behind the chair to reveal sandra's hands are loosening the bonds. blood trickles from where the rope's cut through her skin.}
