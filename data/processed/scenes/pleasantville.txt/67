<A>__{he heads toward work with his apron and his paper hat, but he's clearly disconcerted. david stops and stares at a bright red hot rod parked at the front door of the restaurant. he shakes his head.}
<B>__{soda shop.}
<A>__{the place has been transformed. what was cheery and benign a couple of days before, has gotten a little bit dangerous. the letterman sweaters have been replaced by leather jackets. the pat boone and johnny mathis have given way to real rock and roll. there is a james dean marlon brando edge in the air. somebody has played the flip side.}
