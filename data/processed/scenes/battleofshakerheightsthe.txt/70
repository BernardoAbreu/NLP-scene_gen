<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{you did, huh?}
<A>__{kelly walks over to her painting.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{like this painting. stare at it too long and you can't see it anymore. but if someone else sees it for the first time, they can tell exactly what it is.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{i don't need any more bullshit right now.}
<A>__{kelly stops, taken aback. he walks away from the painting.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{he could never understand you.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{i'm not as complicated as you think.}
