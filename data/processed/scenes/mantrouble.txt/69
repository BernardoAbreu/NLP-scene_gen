<L>__{interior house of bliss office late day}
<A>__{harry behind his desk, irritable, avoiding eye contact with joan, who is seated across from him on the window bench. (see appendix for new items, visible on the crime collage behind harry.)}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i told this detective i wanted to press charges against red layls, for abducting andy, for burglarizing my apartment, for breaking into her house...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh come on, you're way off.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{and that he's been trying to scare and intimidate me in case i might have read something in her manuscript that he doesn't want anybody to know. and you know what he said? that i haven't given him probable cause to even go and question red layls, or his lawyer...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, he's right, i could've told you that. this is a man who goes fishing with the president, honey.}
<P>__{(grabs a pack of cigarettes)}
<D>__{he's a little high up to go around burglarizing people and sending them nasty notes. so why don't you just ease back on this thing for awhile...}
<P>__{(lighting up)}
<D>__{life's too godammed short.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i can't do that, harry. this is my sister. i can at least make out a missing persons report on her, and then i want to talk to the private detective friend of yours.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm trying to chase the guy down, okay? but don't go and make yourself sick...}
<A>__{he begins pushing the paraphernalia around on his desk:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i mean, jesus, why don't you just get this damn thing and hand it over to me and i will give it to these guys.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you mean to red?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, to red, or whoever...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{well if i ever find, it, that's the last thing i'd do with it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{dammit, you're making my work more difficult for me, you know that!}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{what is this, have i come at the wrong time or something?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i tell you what the hell to do and you don't listen to me!}
<A>__{joan looks down at the floor, attempting a drollery:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{well, someone abates your maidenhood and suddenly feels they can start ordering you around.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm not ordering you around. i'm just giving you my opinion. and maybe i get tired of hearing about this stuff all the time, this book business, this manu whatever, and red layls, and your sister.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{oh. well...}
<P>__{(deeply hurt)}
<D>__{i'm sorry if i've overtaxed you with my problems, harry, but i never asked you to consider them a part of your work.}
<P>__{(stands up)}
<D>__{so why don't we speak when you're in a better frame of mind.}
<A>__{as she crosss to the door, harry stands up:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ah honey, now...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{aw honey yourself.}
<A>__{she disappears into the reception room and can be heard going out the door. harry moves to the window, unhappily watching as joan gets into the mercedes and drives off.}
<B>__{on harry}
<A>__{again seated at his desk. he stares out the window, in the throes of a moral conflict. then making some sudden resolve he opens a drawer, takes out an envelope and a paperback book and lays them on the desk.}
<B>__{closeup on paperback}
<A>__{the price sticker is still attached above the title: dante's divine comedy simplified edition. he opens the book, removes the typhon voucher from between its pages and begins addressing the envelope with the information on the check. then he puts the voucher into the envelope and seals it.}
