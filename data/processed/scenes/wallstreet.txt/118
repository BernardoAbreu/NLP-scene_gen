<L>__{exterior bud's condo terrace night}
<A>__{bud walks out alone in his blue bathrobe on his parapet overlooking central park. the wind stirs his hair. the east and west sides of the park wrap the city in a diamond necklace of brilliant light. bud stares down at the world. he has it all now. the money. the girl. the magic palace apartment. what more is there? something...because bud suddenly throws a wrenching dislocated look into himself that makes us wonder as he brushes his hand across his face and mutters to himself.}
