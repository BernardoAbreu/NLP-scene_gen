<C>__{coroner}
<D>__{wait a second? who was working here today?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{just me.}
<C>__{coroner}
<D>__{i thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{we did.}
<C>__{coroner}
<D>__{then who operated the store?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{nobody. it was closed.}

<D>__{can we take this now?}
<C>__{coroner}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{the stretcher is wheeled out. midway down the body bag, something protrudes, pushing the bag up. it is an erection. randal stares at it.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{was he alive when...caitlin...}
<C>__{coroner}
<D>__{no. i place the time of death at about three twenty.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{then how could she...you know...}
<C>__{coroner}
<D>__{the body can maintain an erection after expiration. sometimes for hours. did he have the adult magazine when he came in?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{no. i gave it to him.}
<A>__{randal and the coroner stare in disbelief.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{well he asked me for it!}
<C>__{coroner}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. that's when the girl found him.}
<P>__{(sniffing the air)}
<D>__{something smells like shoe polish.}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(to coroner)}

<C>__{dante}
<D>__{she thought it was me.}
<A>__{the coroner stares at dante.}
<C>__{coroner}
<D>__{what kind of convenience store do you run here?}
<A>__{he exits. dante and randal stare at the floor.}
