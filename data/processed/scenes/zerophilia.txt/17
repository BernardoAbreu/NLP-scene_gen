<L>__{interior luke's house day}
<A>__{luke storms through the house, trying to evade janine, who enthusiastically follows. keenan traipses after.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you told her?!}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i had to. you know janine. she knew somethin' was up.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i've read about this kinda' thing, but i didn't think it was real. it's so cool!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it's disgusting!}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{how can you say that? if i had a chance to be a guy for a day, i'd jump at it. seriously, keen, wouldn't you want to get inside a girl's body?}
<A>__{realizing she just handed him the perfect straight line...}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{don't even go there!}
<P>__{(rolling her eyes)}
<D>__{fine. you're boys. still, isn't it every guy's dream to have a pair of boobs to play with anytime he wants?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{not my own!}
<P>__{(to keenan)}
<D>__{man, how could you tell her?!}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{she should be here. it's just weird, two guys alone, one turnin' into a girl.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{yeah, i can't wait. not exactly something you get to see every day.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{forget it!}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{what, he gets to, and i don't!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no one gets to!}
<A>__{luke goes in the bedroom, slams the door. keenan and janine take up residence outside. janine tries to peek through the keyhole, beneath the door.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{should we put on some soft music?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{you want a magazine in there?}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{shut up!}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{janine keeps an ear held close against the door.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{how 'bout a couple beers?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{maybe you want to take a bath?}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{will you please shut up?!}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{does he sound different?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{think so.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{oh god!}
<P>__{(lewd)}
<D>__{oh, my god!}
<P>__{(rising in pitch)}
<D>__{oh my gawd!}
<A>__{keenan and janine exchange a worried look.}
<B>__{inside the bedroom}
<A>__{now approaching the mirror, in awe, ...gently raising a hand to touch the exquisite female face reflected there, stands a real female, an absolutely female luke.}
<B>__{outside the door}
<A>__{janine knocks.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{luke? you alright?}
<A>__{the door opens, revealing female luke, wrapped in a sheet. keenan clutches janine. they stare, at a total loss, incredulous...}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{whoa.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{dude.}
<A>__{female luke speaks, with an unmistakably female voice.}
<C>__{female luke}
<D>__{happened fast, huh?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{can we see?}
<A>__{female luke hesitates.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{come on. it's not like i haven't seen you naked a hundred times. and she's a girl!}
<A>__{female luke shyly parts the sheet, revealing her stunning naked torso.}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{whoa.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{dude.}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{of course they're perfect. i couldn't have tits like that?}
<A>__{female luke checks herself out in the mirror.}
<C>__{female luke}
<D>__{oh, god. look at me.}
<A>__{keenan and janine sit on the edge of the bed, in shock.}
<C>__{female luke }
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<A>__{keenan, afraid to answer, looks to janine. they both have the same reaction...}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{you're really hot. victoria's secret hot.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{sports illustrated swimsuit edition.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{latvian lesbians' hidden camera chronicles.}
<P>__{(to keenan)}
<D>__{don't look at me, it's your tape.}
<A>__{keenan keeps his distance from luke, embarrassed, if turned on.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{look, i just wanna' get one thing straight. no way i'm gonna' sleep with you.}
<C>__{female luke}
<D>__{man, even as a joke, that's just sick!}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i will. i'm definitely not into the butch hair thing, though. you gotta' do something about that.}
<A>__{keenan looks at her shocked.}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{i thought you're into watchin' two girls?}
<A>__{keenan's speechless. female luke can't stop gazing at herself in the mirror.}
<C>__{female luke}
<D>__{this is too weird. this is freaking me out.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{should we call dr. catchadourian?}
<C>__{female luke}
<D>__{what for? i did it. now, i can switch back. get outta' here.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{already?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{yeah, okay, yeah.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{will you stop starin'?!}
<A>__{janine rolls her eyes, as she and keenan back out of the room, their eyes locked on her amazing body. outside bedroom later janine and keenan are sprawled on the nearby couch. luca opens the door.}
<C>__{female luke}
<D>__{janine? it's like i can't get in the right mood or something.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{welcome to my world. oh, honey, no one could in this situation.}
<C>__{female luke}
<D>__{you gotta' help. i need to do this right now!}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{you can't force these things.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{some girls go half their lives before they even have one.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{okay, studly, what do you suggest?}
<C>__{keenan}

<C>__{janine}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{"you're so beautiful," "i love your smile," "the english patient was my favorite movie too."}
<A>__{janine and female luke both roll their eyes. female luke swings the door shut. the doorbell chimes.}

<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{is there anything you want me to tell luke?}
<A>__{max gets fluid, scanning the room for a toehold, infatuated by luca. he seizes on a hockey stick.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm way into hockey. i was hopin' luke could show me the ropes. is he as awesome as i've heard?}
<C>__{luca}

<D>__{it's a girl thing.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{does he need any help in there?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{not from you.}
<A>__{outside bedroom door later keenan and janine sprawled out, leaning against the door, half eaten pizza between them on the floor, weary. buzzing emanates from inside the bedroom.}
<C>__{luca }
<D>__{this is good!}
<A>__{keenan and janine perk up.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{finally.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{alright, okay, now open those little levers on the sides,... and flip that center thingy back...}
<A>__{keenan finds this particularly unsettling.}
<C>__{luca }
<P>__{(enthused)}
<D>__{did you get this thing at the mall?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{janine wouldn't have one a' those.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{please. and mine's got way more features than that one.}

<A>__{keenan grabs the last bottle from his six pack.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i'm just sayin', he's not that experienced with girls.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{oh, and you are?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i'm startin' to wonder if you are?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i'm not gonna' feed your fantasies.}
<A>__{keenan flips the tv remote, disturbed.}
<B>__{inside the bedroom}
<A>__{luca sits on the edge of the bed, frustrated.}
<D>__{janine (o.s.) (cont'd) luca?}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{don't call me that!}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{you gotta' just think about whatever turns you on. no matter what it is.}
<A>__{luca considers, she goes over to the window, peers out momentarily, then draws back.}
<B>__{outside the bedroom}
<A>__{janine lies down on the floor.}
<C>__{janine }
<P>__{(last ditch)}
<D>__{okay, pretend you're thrown on your back, pinned against the bed...}
<A>__{spread eagle, eyes closed, she fantasizes, as she directs...}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{you can't move an arm, a leg, nothing, even an inch!}
<A>__{keenan glances over, taken aback at her tone...}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{and two strong hands feel your thighs,...}
<A>__{keenan watches, getting turned on...}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{creeping firmly, slowly toward your breasts...}
<A>__{keenan lunges for janine.}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{keen!}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{babe, every time i look at you, i get the shivers! i just want to rip your clothes off, and throw you down...}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{oh, keen!}
<A>__{they're kissing, rolling around together now,...}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i want to envelop every inch of you, that incredible curve along your side,...}
<A>__{they roll on the floor, clothes torn...}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{i want to pin your arms over your head, and make mad, passionate...}
<C>__{luca }
<D>__{aaahhh!}
<A>__{keenan and janine recoil. whether agony or ecstasy, it's a frightening sound. the door opens. luke stands in his shorts, all male.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{you're a screamer.}
