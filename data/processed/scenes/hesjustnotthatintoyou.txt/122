<A>__{a staple of summer in baltimore. the rickety baltimore blade float comes by. it's a very phallic "blade" with a a bunch of young shirtless men dancing and waving. mary rides the float, too, waving to the crowd with nathan, joshua and bruce. conor, with a nattily dressed gay couple, stands on the street watching. nathan calls down from the float.}
