<B>__{the sixth day}
<T>__{fade up on nancy:}
<A>__{'s house, early morning.}
<L>__{interior nancy's kitchen. day.}
<A>__{marge is on the telephone, the dirty hat in her hand. nearby is a nearly empty bottle of gin.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{she said she snatched it off his head in a dream.}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{no, i'm not crazy, i've got the damn thing in my hand!}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{i know we did, we all...}
<P>__{(hears nancy approaching)}
<D>__{gotta go.}
<A>__{she hangs up and stuffs the hat and bottle into a drawer, screening the action with her body. nancy enters. by now the girl has an extraordinary look. her hair is ashen, her skin transluscent, and eyes dark ringed. her right forearm is heavily bandaged over the slashes. in short, instead of the girl next door, we now could be looking at the lunatic from the next cell. marge, though she does her best to hide it, is downright frightened of her.}
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{you didn't sleep, did you? the doctor says you have to sleep or you'll }
<A>__{nancy pours herself a cup of black coffee.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{go even crazier?}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{i don't think you're going crazy and stop drinking that damn coffee!}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{did you ask daddy to have the hat examined?}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{i threw that filthy thing away i don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but }
<A>__{nancy comes closer, her eyes shining with a new sureness.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{what i learned at the dream clinic, that's what i'm trying to prove. rod didn't kill tina, and he didn't hang himself. it's this guy he's after us in our dreams.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{but that's just not reality, nancy!}
<A>__{furious, nancy janks open the drawer before marge can stop her and spills the bottle and hat onto the counter. marge grabs away the bottle protectively but it's the hat nancy goes for. she waves it triumphantly demonically.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{it's real , mamma. feel it.}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{put that damned thing down!}
<A>__{marge lunges for it nancy leaps out of reach }
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{his name is even in it written right in here fred krueger fred krueger! you know who that is, mamma? you better tell me, cause now he's after me!}
<A>__{marge swallows, then persists in the lie.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{nancy, trust your mother for once you'll feel better as soon as you sleep!}
<A>__{nancy shoots a hard humorless laugh, holding up her slashed arm.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{you call this feeling better? or should i grab a bottle and veg out with you avoid everything happening to me by just getting good and loaded }
<A>__{marge slaps her hard.}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{fred krueger can't be after you, nancy he's dead !}
<A>__{the room falls silent, both women staring at the other.}
<C>__{marge }
<P>__{(low, raw)}
<D>__{fred krueger is dead. dead and gone. believe me, i know. now go to bed. i order you, go to bed.}
<A>__{marge snatches the hat away. nancy is furious, betrayed.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{you knew about him all this time, and you've been acting like he was someone i made up!}
<A>__{marge pulls away.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{you're sick, nancy. imagining things. you need to sleep, it's as simple as that.}
<A>__{nancy wheels and smashes marge's bottle of gin in the sink.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{screw sleep!}
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{nancy!}
<A>__{but nancy runs past her mother for the front door.}
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{nancy it's only a nightmare!}
<A>__{nancy turns in the doorway.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{that's enough !}
<A>__{on the door slam, we}
