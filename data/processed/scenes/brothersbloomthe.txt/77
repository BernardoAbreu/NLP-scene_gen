<L>__{interior state room night}
<A>__{the brothers dress for dinner.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{you named the chink `yuengling?'}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i was writing in a bar. and she doesn't drink, how does she know a philly beer?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{she knows a lot of stuff.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{was that who i thought it was on the east deck this morning?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{yes it was. did he spot you?}
<A>__{an ominous glance.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{not yet.}
<L>__{exterior deck night}
<A>__{several small tables scattered about the moonlit deck, bloom and penelope sit with flutes of champagne. penelope, in an elegant but understated dress, shuffles a pack of cards.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{you look very nice.}
<A>__{she laughs as if at a joke she doesn't think is funny.}
<C>__{bloom }
<D>__{what was your childhood like?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{i make cameras out of watermelons.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{lonely.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{lucky guess.}
<A>__{penelope's hands move faster. she knows how to shuffle cards.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{how was it lonely?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{fishing for an entertaining childhood anecdote that encapsulates my adult issues?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{well it's funny how everyone's usually got one.}
<A>__{as penelope tells her story she gets fancier with her shuffles.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{when i turned six i started getting allergies, hayfever, rashes, really bad. so my mom took me into the doctor, and he did that test where they use needles to prick a grid on your back with all the different toxins, to see which ones you're allergic to. the next day i came in, the doctor lifted up my shirt, and my back looked like a patch of oily, moldy, blackish green double puff marshmallows. i was allergic to everything. so they sealed the house with plastic and a special ventilation system, and i spent my entire childhood and adolescence indoors. mostly alone. lonely.}
<A>__{she pulls the queens out of the deck and lays them face up on the table.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{wow.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{it wasn't `til i was nineteen they discovered what i was actually allergic to was the aluminum alloy the hypodermic needle was made out of. then i was going to leave, but my mom got sick. so i stayed. and she stayed sick, a long time.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{do you feel cheated?}
<A>__{penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{the trick to not feeling cheated is to learn how to cheat. so i decided this wasn't a story about a miserable girl trapped in a house that smelled like medical supplies wasting her life on a dying person she sometimes hated. it was about a girl who could find infinite beauty in anything, any little thing. and do anything she decided to do. and love the person she was trapped with. so i told myself that story until it became true. now did doing that let me escape a wasted life, or did it just blind me so i wouldn't want to escape it? i don't know. but either way, i was the one telling my own story. so i don't feel cheated.}
<A>__{she finishes the trick. a single pair of hands clapping turns their heads. at the far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear at the moment will be called the curator.}
<C>__{the curator}
<D>__{and a magician is just an actor playing the part of a magician. my compliments.}
<A>__{bloom takes penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up and away.}
