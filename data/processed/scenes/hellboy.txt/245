<A>__{visible from all over moscow, the beam blazes to the moon! the same phenomenon as in the prologue, but this time it's more intense, with ripples and haloes.}

<A>__{again, the infinite, starry space. again, the ogdru jahad. the ruby beam pierces the darkness.}
<L>__{interior catacombs night}
<A>__{hellboy watches as the first imprint disappears. in its place: a burning glyph. myers struggles with his bindings. the rough hemp cuts his skin, but he manages to free one hand.}
<L>__{exterior on the other side night}
<A>__{ogdru jahad shifts, suddenly breaking free. gelatinous limbs uncurl, expand. its enormity puzzles the eye, obscuring the frame.}
