<A>__{the word has spread. everybody in town is gathered at pham van's. they rush out to meet val and earl as they drive up.}

<D>__{you're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...}
<A>__{but he stops because they're all staring wide eyed at the rear of the truck.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{my god...!}
<A>__{val and earl jump out and look where everyone else is looking. their jaws drop. reveal: hanging from the rear axle of their truck and trailing out behind like a nightmare wedding decoration a sex foot long, grotesque, fleshy, tentacle. the end gripping the axle looks like a vicious, razor sharp beak or hook. the trailing end is mutilated, oozing orange goo as though the creature was torn in half.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{unreal! where'd you get it?}

<C>__{earl}
<D>__{or a big mother slug maybe?}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{some kind of mutation...?}
<A>__{burt, more daring than the others, pries the thing off the axle with a shovel.}
<C>__{pham van}
<D>__{don't touch, don't touch.}
<C>__{burt}

<C>__{burt}
<D>__{just one of these couldn't eat up off a whole flock of sheep. there's gotta be more out there, a lot more.}
