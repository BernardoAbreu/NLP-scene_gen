<L>__{interior corridor day}
<A>__{the main corridor. it seems to go on forever. amy turns back to the common area. empty. the she hears the familiar sound of a little girl screaming. it's faint and echoing. amy turns back down the corridor to the little girl's voice.}

<D>__{it's all about finding the truth...}
<A>__{amy starts to slowly make her way down the long cold corridor. with each step she takes, the walls of the corridor become whiter, slowly bleaching out. she looks below her and sees the blood now draining from the wound. she stumbles back slowly and turns as the little girl's screams continue. then she hears the banging and rattling of a door. like someone's fighting to get out.}
