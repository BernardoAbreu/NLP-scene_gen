<A>__{two minions raise their ice cream sundaes and clink them together!}
<C>__{minions}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{pull back to reveal many minions singing and dancing. we move through the crowd, passing by the mace wielding minion with his helmet still backwards and a smaller server minion with a tray of ice cream sundaes in mugs. we cut up to the rafters, where more minions are dancing and singing in formation, jumping and hopping all over the place in elaborate dance routines. back on the floor, three arm in arm minions take the chorus. one of them clearly having had one too many sundaes is being held up by the other two. another minion tries to carry empty mugs down a spiral staircase, but he's knocked off by a bunch of minions running up the other way. several minions sit around a communal bowl of ice cream, lazily sipping at it through long straws. gru enters and takes it all in. other minions raid an ice cream cart, hanging from the canopy, drinking directly from the spouts.}

<D>__{alright, hey, hey no, no, no, no! hey, please!}

<D>__{kevin, jerry, watch the girls for me, okay?}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{dave, stuart come this way. with me! come on!}
<A>__{dave downs a jar of maraschino cherries and sprays whip cream into his mouth before running after them, with a toothpick umbrella in his mouth for good measure.}
<D>__{gru (o.s.) (cont'd) come on!}
<A>__{once they are gone, the minions go back to singing and laughing.}
