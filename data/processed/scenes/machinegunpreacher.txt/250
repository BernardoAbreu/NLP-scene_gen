<L>__{interior sam's tukul children's orphanage night}
<A>__{and we see sam here in the dark... moonlight filtering in through the thatched roof... like shards of glass cutting through the blackness... and he doesn't look right here... soul worn thin... eyes hollow... starting to go someplace very bad... ... images flashing in his head... babies burned and screaming... donnie in his coffin... and we realize we're watching something here... his world starting to cave in on him... ... and he drops against his cot... distraught... tears in his eyes and this man is breaking... and suddenly we see a gun in his hand... finger curling around the trigger as he puts it to his head... eyes closing against the world... and...}
<B>__{we hear a knock at his door}
<A>__{sam frozen... still holding the gun... and slowly the door pushes open and we hear soft footsteps shuffling into this dark room... ... and william steps into the light, sees sam here on the ground with the gun in his hand... and slowly he moves next to him, sitting on the cot without saying a word... just the two of them here for a moment... and then slowly he begins in perfect english...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i remember my parents when i sleep. i see them in my dreams sometimes.}
<A>__{sam looking to william... this small boy sitting above him... telling his story...}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{my father was big like you. they shot him. we were so scared. then the rebels gave me a club and told me if i didn't kill my mother they would shoot my brother and me.}
<A>__{and william pauses in his story... lost in this memory... his face becoming a mask of pain... but no tears... there are no more tears in this young man left to be shed... and so he continues...}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{i refused, but my mother told me to swing hard... that i must make her proud...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and so i did. i made her proud.}
<A>__{and now william looks down at sam... staring at this man on the ground... and he reaches out and gently touches sam's head... a moment of tenderness for both of them... an act of love.... these two broken souls finding each another here... and william says...}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{if we allow ourselves to become full of hate then they've won. we must not let them take our hearts. this is the most important thing.}
<A>__{and sam sets the gun down and reaches out to william, pulls him into an embrace... holding him close... and we know that without a doubt this boy has saved this man's life.}
