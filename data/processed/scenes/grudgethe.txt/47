<A>__{matthew re enters, out of breath. he sits next to jennifer, who hasn't moved. puts a hand on her chest to make sure she's still breathing. she is.}

<D>__{jesus christ...}
<A>__{he looks through the dictionary, finding the word he needs:}
<C>__{matthew}
<D>__{`ambulance'... "kyukyusha".}
<A>__{then he quickly rips open the yellow pages seeing, in plain english, `emergency' on the first page. below that: `fire ambulance dial 119'. he drops the book and reaches across the bed for a phone, on a table at the far side the boy (toshio) stands up, between matthew and the phone. but he looks different from before: his skin is discolored, his lips and eyes are ringed and sullen.}
<C>__{matthew}
<D>__{who are you? what what are you doing here?}
<A>__{toshio makes a strange sound. looks at jennifer, then turns to matthew, snarling at him like a cat. matthew, shocked, falls backwards off the bed, hitting the table with the lamp. it drops to the ground and toshio's shadow, cast by the fallen light, begins to stretch and grow across the ceiling. the shadow creeps over jennifer, shifting and coming towards matthew matthew grabs the lamp. he reaches it, holding it up at first, it looks like both jennifer and toshio have disappeared. but then jennifer, suddenly back on the bed, sits upright, jerkily, as if she's been yanked up and forward. her mouth is wide and gasping and then she falls back onto the bed. dead. matthew, stunned, backs away from the bed, against the closet. terrified, he doesn't notice the thud thud sound growing around him. then toshio's head comes into frame behind him. matthew hears a growling sound and turns, seeing toshio right there! }
