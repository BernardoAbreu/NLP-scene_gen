<L>__{exterior city park day.}
<A>__{the same silence over a beautiful day in the city. and from the silence, the faint sound of wind through the leafy branches of trees. two children play in a playground in a small park. it's jennifer and michael. they seem happy, engrossed. other kids play around them. watching them from a bench is frank. he is a little older, a little thinner. close on frank's face. the sound of his children playing.}
