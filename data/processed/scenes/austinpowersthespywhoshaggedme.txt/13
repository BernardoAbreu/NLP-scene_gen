<A>__{number two smiles weakly, breaking into a sweat on his brow.}
<C>__{number two}
<D>__{may i add, i appreciate you reinstating me after our little... misunderstanding.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{frau farbissina. wie gehts is einen?}
<A>__{we see frau. she looks a little more 'masculine' than before.}
<C>__{frau}
<D>__{zehr gut, herr doctor.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{how are things?}
<C>__{frau}
<D>__{i have come to embrace the love that dare not speak it's name. to my right is my lover.}
<A>__{we see a severe looking german woman with one continuous eyebrow.}
<C>__{frau}
<D>__{her name is unibrau. i met her on the lpga tour.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{right on. welcome, unibrau.}
<A>__{dr. evil takes another sip of cappuccino, making the frothy milk mustache even larger.}
<C>__{frau}
<D>__{doctor, you have a 'milk mustache.'}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<P>__{(wiping it off, embarrassed)}
<D>__{oh, i know. i know.}
<C>__{number two}
<D>__{dr. evil, i'd like to introduce the greek assassin, oedipus.}
<A>__{we see a swarthy greek army guy.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{welcome to my private army, oedipus. excited?}
<C>__{oedipus}
<D>__{i could give a shit.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{kiss your mother with that mouth?}
<C>__{oedipus}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{of course you do.}
<A>__{dr evil begins to press a button labelled "oedipus" on his control panel, but number two interrupts.}
<C>__{number two}
<P>__{(clearing throat)}
<D>__{dr. evil, as you know, the rate at which you liquidate henchmen far exceeds our ability to replace them.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{i have so few pleasures left to me, number two. the key to life is to rotate your vices. one day it's executions, another day it's creamy french cheese. it's like frickin' heroin.}
<C>__{number two}
<D>__{well, dr. evil, perhaps i have the answer. while you were frozen, we began a program to clone you.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{number two}
<D>__{we had a few glitches, but i think you'll be pleased with the results.}
<C>__{frau}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{send in the clone!}
<A>__{music: dramatic sting we see the shadow of an approaching figure. the shadow looks like dr. evil, only much larger and scarier.}
<C>__{number two}
<D>__{he is identical to you in every way, except he is one eighth your size.}
<A>__{we see that the source of the shadow is a miniature dr. evil, just like the creepy mini marlon brando in the island of dr. moreau. he mimics dr. evil's mannerisms including holding his tiny pinky to his tiny mouth.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{breathtaking. i shall call him mini me.}
<P>__{(to clone)}
<D>__{mini me, you will sit to my right.}
<A>__{mini me sits down in a miniature version of dr. evil's command chair.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{come mr. bigglesworth!}
<A>__{the bald mr. bigglesworth runs and jumps into dr. evil's lap. a bald mr. bigglesworth kitten jumps into mini me's lap.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{mini me, something to eat?}
<P>__{(expectant pause)}
<D>__{no?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{ok.}
<P>__{(to room)}
<D>__{tired. gentleman, i have a plan. as you know, the most powerful man in the world is the president of the united states. but he is just that a man, subject to temptations of the flesh like any other man. here's what we do: we make it seem that the president has had "extra marital oral relations" with and this is the kicker }
<A>__{dramatic sting, snap zoom to dr. evil.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{with a white house intern!}
<A>__{dr. evil gloats. so does mini me.}
<C>__{number two}
<P>__{(clearing his throat)}
<D>__{uh hem.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{what, that already happened?}
<A>__{number two nods.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{this is ri goddamn diculous. oh well, how about a frickin' time machine? does the president have a time machine? have i been scooped on that?}
<C>__{number two}
<D>__{no, not that i'm aware of.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{alright, time machine it is. as you know, every diabolical scheme i've hatched has been thwarted by austin powers. and why is that, ladies and gentlemen?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{because you never kill him when you get the chance and you're a dope?}
<A>__{mini me hops upon the table and tries to push the "scott evil" button on dr. evil's control panel. frau squirts him with a water bottle. mini me glares at scott and gives him the finger.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{no, because austin powers has "mojo".}
<C>__{number two}
<D>__{mojo?}
<C>__{frau}
<D>__{yes, mojo. the mojo is the life force, the essence, the libido, the "right stuff".}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{it's what the french call a certain 'i don't know what.'}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{if you've got a time machine, why don't you just go back and kill austin powers when he's a baby or something?}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{no, no, no.}
<C>__{number two}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{dr. evil, wouldn't it be easier to use your knowledge of the future to play the stock market? we could literally make trillions.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<P>__{(smug laugh to himself)}
<D>__{why make trillions when we could make...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{billions?}
<C>__{number two}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{why think small is all i'm saying.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{a trillion is more than a billion, numb nuts.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{zip it. unveil the time portal!}
<A>__{a wall panel opens to reveal a stargate like wall of shimmering energy.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, i give you the time portal. as you know, austin powers was frozen in 1967. therefore, i time travel to 1969, two years after he was frozen. security will be lax and i will strike when he is totally helpless.}
<A>__{first, i take austin powers' mojo. then i begin my domination of the world.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{can i come?}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{no, scott, daddy has a score to settle. austin powers is the snake to my mongoose, or the mongoose to my snake. either way it's bad, i don't know animals. but i do know this: this time it's personal. frau, number 2, i will see you both in 1969. come, mini me.}
<A>__{dr. evil walks to the portal. mini me follows, imitating him perfectly. they enter the portal. there is a freeze frame effect and they fade away: , like in star trek.}
