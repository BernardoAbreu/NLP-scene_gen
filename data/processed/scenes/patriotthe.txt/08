<A>__{the loveliest spot on the farm. a beautiful view of the house, barns, river, fields and hills beyond. a gravestone stands in the shade of a single apple tree. it reads:}
<D>__{elizabeth putnam marion 1738 1773}
<A>__{above her name is a carving of the night sky, at the center of which is the north star, steady and guiding. marion approaches. he gives himself a moment to look at the grave, then he starts picking apples, speaking to the gravestone in a quiet voice that is more matter of fact than sorrowful.}

<D>__{... and they bundled half... almost no trace of the boys you knew...}
<A>__{a soft wind blows some dry leaves along the ground. marion pauses as if listening to a spoken reply.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{... no, she still hasn't spoken... margaret was her age when you... i remember the time at the river when we couldn't find catherine... you couldn't stop crying... and she was asleep in the wagon the entire time...}
<A>__{marion pauses, remembering. the crash of a plate breaking, followed by the sound of an argument rises from the house below. marion shakes his head with an exasperated sigh.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{your children.}
<A>__{he heads down the hill toward the house, now glowing from the lights of candles and oil lamps.}
