<L>__{interior red parlor day}
<A>__{nell, panic rising in her voice, confronts the others.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{welcome home eleanor. welcome home? i've never been here. who did this?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it's somebody's idea of a joke.}
<A>__{she looks at all three of them.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{who did this? why are you doing this? i don't know any of you. you don't know me. why are you doing this to me?}
<A>__{luke shakes his head. theo starts getting pissed. marrow stands there, arms folded, observing.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i didn't do it.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{you could have.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{so could you! is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{theo... did you?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{maybe you did it yourself.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{i don't know. you've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.}
<P>__{(pointing to marrow)}
<D>__{maybe he did it...}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{i didn't. you know that, nell.}
<A>__{this is horrifying to nell, being doubted and accused of something so ugly if it were true.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i don't know anything. whoever did this, please, just... just say so... just... please... this is cruel. don't be cruel to me. i can't stand it. you don't know me.}
<A>__{and she runs out. nell grabs for the door to leave. she flings open the door. monstrous arms seem to grab at her. but it's only a wild looking coat rack in the hall.}
