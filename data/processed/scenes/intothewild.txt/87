<A>__{chris sits up reading, his tent entry flap ajar to let the small candle lantern ventilate. os we hear a zipping sound. it's rainey. we see him from chris' pov coming out of his tent deep in thought. as he moves to the glowing embers of what remains of the campfire, rainey's face goes out of frame and all chris can see are his booted feet, tapping bits of glowing wood into the center of the fire. the tapping is slow and thoughtful. micro embers float upward into the night. chris' tent flap closes by his own hand. angle: chris' dog ears his book and puts out the lantern.}
