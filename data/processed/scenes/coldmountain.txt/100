<L>__{interior junior's cabin, night}
<A>__{lila, junior's wife, spoons out stew from a vast pot. the table crammed with customers her three sisters, the three men, the herd of dogs and filthy children. nobody speaks. each time lila bends over to spoon out of the pot, her cleavage strains against the flimsy fabric of her dress. veasey's mesmerized. inman is also getting drunk, his eyes increasingly glazed. when lila makes to sit down next to junior, he slides a hand up her dress, exposing a naked buttock, which he strokes and pinches as he pulls away.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{junior grins, looks over at inman, then nudges veasey.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{he's gone now. look! his eyes have gone.}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(vaguely, drunk)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{dolly?}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{s'me.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{dolly, lila, shyla and mae. that's a poem. that's a poem.}
<A>__{he begins to recite, has a verse in his mind.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{dolly, lila, shyla and mae}
<P>__{(but he can' t summon it)}
<D>__{da da da da da da dae...}
<P>__{(vague)}
<D>__{...there's a poem there.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{i'm leaving soon as i'm full.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{really. goodbye.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{got a bunch of traps needs visiting. i will be back tomorrow, before dark. you'll still be here?}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{that's my fervent prayer.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{my house is your house.}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{like to wash their hands and pray.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{say again?}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{dolly, lila, shyla and mae.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{that's job. don't say much but even liquored up there's a preacher in him.}
<A>__{inman gets up suddenly, sways.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i will say my goodbyes, got miles and miles to go before sunset.}
<P>__{(head spinning)}
<D>__{i will just quickly lie down.}
<A>__{and he stumbles over to the fire where he instantly curls up.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{i'm heading for that smokehouse and i'm ready to be washed clean of my dirt.}
<A>__{he gets up, wanders out of the door. junior's eyes glinterior he jerks his head towards the girls then in the direction of the smokehouse.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{you go tend to him.}
<P>__{(to lila)}
<D>__{i will be seeing you.}
<A>__{he picks up his gun and leaves dolly gathering up the children and herding them out.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{come on you get!}
<A>__{shyla stays, mae having gone off after veasey. lila waits until the children have gone. they consider inman supine by the fire.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{he's mine. you can go rub yourself off on the preacher.}
<P>__{(of inman)}
<D>__{gonna make him hug me till i grunt.}
<A>__{lila shepherds shyla out, shuts the door, swigs from the jug, walks over to inman, then turns to the big table and pushes pots and plates way down to one end to make a playing field. then she bends over the prostrate inman.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{inman stirs, glazed.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(kneeling down to him)}
<D>__{you want to see what mamma's got for you?}
<B>__{she slips a sleeve of her dress to reveal a full breast.}
<A>__{inman is drunk, doesn't think he's awake. she takes her breast to his mouth, and inman suckles. then she puts his hands under the dress which rides up as his hands move between her legs. she's naked.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{that's good. ain't that sweet?}
<A>__{she pulls inman to his feet, kisses him, then turns her back and lies face down on the table, her bare ass undulating in}
<B>__{the air.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{you just get on and ride me all the way to china.}
<A>__{he doesn't move, except to sway, eyes glazed. she turns.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{you shy? you need a hand?}
<P>__{(goes to his buttons)}
<D>__{let's have a look see what we can muster.}
<A>__{she's kneeling now, her dress hunched up around her middle, working the front of inman's pants. he's in a swoon, surrendering to her, getting aroused, his hand cupping her head. on cue, the door crashes open and he's staring down the barrel of junior's shotgun. as lila turns, junior kicks her violently in the head, knocking her over.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{you little bitch! look at you! cover yourself up!}
<A>__{next he swings the shotgun barrel against the side of inman's head. inman falls back. junior goes to the door and whistles.}
<B>__{and with that the room fills up with a group of home guard}
<A>__{bristling with weapons and purpose. they seize inman, drag}
<B>__{him out as junior spits and kicks at him.}
