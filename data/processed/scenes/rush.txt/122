<D>__{has niki changed?}
<C>__{caldwell}
<D>__{no. he's going on wets.}
<A>__{niki's car: surrounded by italian ferrari mechanics.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{then we go on wets, too.}
<A>__{james pulls down his visor...as he and niki's eyes meet for a split second, then... the starter waves the flag. they're off! james's foot hits the floor his engine screams at almost}
