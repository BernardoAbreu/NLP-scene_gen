<L>__{interior todd's bedroom night}
<A>__{todd's room is dark as he lies on the floor, writing something on a pile of index cards. the only light comes from the hallway through the open door of the bedroom. todd is deep in thought, but from the bits of shredded index cards we can tell the writing is not coming easily.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{the road ahead reveals itself, uh, god, no. the road ahead... grrrr, the fucking road ahead.}
<A>__{monica appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{todd?}
<A>__{todd doesn't notice her. he stares down at the card. finally he looks up, as if it took her voice a few seconds to register in his mind. his response is hardly audible.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{what are you doing there in the dark?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{oh, ...working.}
<A>__{monica reaches in to his room to turn on the light. she touches the switch but then pulls her hand back. todd is back at the note card. she looks at him oddly, worried, but then steps away from the door and goes downstairs. todd's lips are moving, as if he were speaking to himself. he pauses. then, in a sudden gust of inspiration begins to write furiously. he finishes and stands up, catching his reflection in the mirror above his desk. in the eerie half light, he stares at the ghost like image of himself.}
