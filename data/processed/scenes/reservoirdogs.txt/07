<D>__{i wasn't born yesterday. i'm hurt, and i'm hurt bad.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{it's not good...}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. i was panicking for a moment, but i've got my senses back now. the situation is, i'm shot in the belly. and without medical attention, i'm gonna die.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{i can' take you to a hospital.}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{fuck jail! i don't give a shit about jail. but i can't die. you don't have to take me in. just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. i will take care of myself. i won't tell them anything. i swear to fucking god, i won't tell 'em anything. look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.}
<P>__{(mr. white does)}
<D>__{i won't tell them anything. you'll be safe.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{lie back down, and try to }
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{i'm going to die! i need a doctor! i'm begging you, take me to a doctor.}
<A>__{mr. orange lays his head back on the mattress. spent from his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{take me to a doctor, take me to a doctor, please.}
<A>__{suddenly, the warehouse door bursts open and mr. pink steps inside.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{was that a fucking set up or what?}
<A>__{mr. pink sees mr. orange on the floor, shot and bloody.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{oh fuck, orange got tagged.}
<A>__{throughout this scene, we hear mr. orange moaning.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{gun shot.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{oh that's just fucking great! where's brown?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{dead.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{goddamn, goddamn! how did he die?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{how the fuck do you think? the cops shot him.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{oh this is bad, this is so bad.}
<P>__{(referring to mr. orange)}
<D>__{is it bad?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{as opposed to good?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{this is so fucked up. somebody fucked us big time.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{you really think we were set up?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{you even doubt it? i don't think we got set up, i know we got set up! i mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? one minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. i didn't hear any sirens. the alarm went off, okay. okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. in one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. all loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? those were the ones responding to the alarm. but those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you haven't thought about this?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{i haven't had a chance to think. first i was just trying to get the fuck outta there. and after we got away, i've just been dealin with him.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{well, you better start thinking about it. cause i, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. in fact, that's all i'm thinking about. i came this close to just driving off. whoever set us up, knows about this place. there could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. for all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{let's go in the other room...}
<A>__{the camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner. we move past it, and see down a hall.}
