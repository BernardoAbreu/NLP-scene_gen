<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{laurel looks out the window, watches her sister exiting. she is equal parts jealous and protective. she spots keys on counter. she grabs them and runs out to catch her sister on the lawn. "all shook down." replacements.}
<L>__{exterior dorothy's house night}
<A>__{jerry and dorothy exit through the many cars which we now see are parked on the street and the front lawn. the sound of the women's group is heard in the warmly glowing house behind them.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{as jerry moves ahead to the car, dorothy retreats so she can have privacy with her sister.}
<C>__{laurel}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{forgot your keys }
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(privately)}
<D>__{that's the first time i ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?}
<P>__{(eyes tear up)}
<D>__{i mean, he must have been needing that.}
<A>__{women's group laughter in the distance as laurel attempts to glue her emotional sister back together. she holds her arm.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{no no. don't cry at the beginning of the date.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(laughing, wiping tear)}
<D>__{oh, knock it off!}
<C>__{laurel}
<P>__{(can't help it)}
<D>__{and don't be a shoulder for him to cry on either.}
<A>__{we stay with laurel as she watches her sister exit. music continues. lit by streetlight, dorothy runs like a young girl, across the lawns of this car filled neighborhood, slapping away the leaves of a tree, running to jerry down the street.}
