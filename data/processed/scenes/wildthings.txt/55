<L>__{interior police interview room day}
<A>__{everyone's looking a little tired, with the possible exception of ray. at this moment he sits back in his chair, staring at sam.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{why don't you tell us one more time, how kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(with growing impatience)}
<D>__{story's the same, detective...}
<A>__{ken pats him on the arm. when sam speaks again, it is in a calmer voice, calm but tired.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i had to go look for this coupon.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{the one you bought at school.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{like i said, i hadn't really expected to use it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{anyway, i'm going through a drawer. i hear a car. i look out the window. i see nicole driving away. i leave my room, and there's kelly.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{in cutoffs, a wet t shirt.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{and she wanted to talk.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{but you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i could, but it's confidential. look, the point is, we didn't talk. i told her this was not an appropriate time or place.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{and she began to cry. and you put an arm around her.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes. mainly to turn her toward the door. i told her we would talk on monday, in the office.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{and when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{again. i think we covered this. i told her i was going to call a cab.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{but she ran away.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{did you call anyone? did you call her house to see if she got home? did you call the masons?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{weren't you a little worried about her...?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{there's a strip mall not half a mile from my house. there's phones there. i cruised the place, but i didn't see her. i figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found. i don't know... maybe i should have called. but it's not like kelly can't take care of herself. i figured we'd just take it up on monday, in the office.}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence in the room.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{but you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her. isn't that against the rules?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it is and i don't. ordinarily...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but, i mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{with a thirty five inch bustline in a wet t shirt with no bra...}
<A>__{he is cut short as sam shoves his chair back from the table.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{fuck you. this is bullshit. i'm outta here.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{sit down, lombardo.}
<A>__{sam and ray stare at one another. ken puts a hand on his client's arm.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{all right, all right... enough.}
<A>__{ken stands up. he walks to the two way mirror set in one wall, rapping on the glass with his knuckles.}
<C>__{ken }
<D>__{we came down here to make a statement. we've made it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if you're going to charge my client, do it now.}
