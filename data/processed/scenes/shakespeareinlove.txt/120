<L>__{interior church. day.}
<A>__{the nurse is holding viola up as they enter the church. viola seems catatonic. the nurse lowers her onto a seat and sits down next to her. as they sit, the choir enters singing. wessex, who is sitting in the next pew, looks about him with interest. he hasn't been in a church for years. what he sees turns him to jelly. he sees will shakespeare. angle on will. will is a spectral, bedraggled figure, backlit by a great shaft of light, he would look like a ghost at the best of times, and this is the worst. bleeding from where he has banged his head, bedraggled and ravaged by the night, he stands in a side chapel staring at wessex. wessex gasps and sweats, and sees will raise a quivering accusatory finger at him. wessex cracks. he starts to mumble.}
<C>__{wessex}
<D>__{oh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for the love of christ!}
<A>__{now viola sees will. she is still paralysed, and seems at first unable to take him in. she watches with detachment as wessex starts to back out of the church, finally running in terror.}
<C>__{wessex }
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{spare me!}
<A>__{the choir continues to sing, but the scream brings viola to her senses and she runs to a side door where will is leaving.}
