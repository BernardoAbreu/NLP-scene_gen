<L>__{exterior trailer night}
<A>__{ronnie's home is a shitty double wide at the very end of the shittiest trailer park in town.}
<L>__{interior ronnie's bedroom night}
<A>__{ronnie lives in a boy's room. there's all kind of posters up with instructions on how to execute choke holds, wrist locks, and other assorted death blows. however, the biggest decoration is a large diagram of the mall. ronnie stands in the middle of his room with his mom across from him. she's an old, thick boozer, with the strength of a father and the love of a mother. she downs a full beer and throws it against the wall.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{you think you're ready for a shot at the title, motherfucker?!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm ready, mom.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{ding ding.}
<A>__{ronnie and his mom take to fighting. ronnie's mom is surprisingly good and she lands the first blows to ronnie's cranium.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{ow!}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{what's wrong, baby? is your pussy hurting?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{ronnie attacks his mom. he manages to scoop her and body slam her to the ground. ronnie's mom flips out of it on the ground. however, ronnie holds onto her wrist and stands up, thus locking in the submission hold.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{ah!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you give?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{ronnie flips the wrist lock tighter!}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{ow!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you move with me, you go down. you move against me and your arm breaks.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i give!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i give! let me go, goddamn it.}
<A>__{ronnie lets his mom go. she shakes off the pain.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i can't believe you got that lucky shit on me.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{luck has nothing to do with it.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{you almost broke my arm.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mom. are you okay?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{not really.}
<A>__{ronnie's mom rubs her arm. ronnie drops his guard and comes over to tend to his mom's wounds. however, she's only playing possum. ronnie's mom sees an opening and attacks ronnie at his legs. ronnie goes down and the two start wrestling again. (note: this plays as realistic as possible, no phony punches or smooth comedy fighting, it looks like a school yard fight video. sloppy and real.)}
