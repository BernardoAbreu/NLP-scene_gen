<D>__{. . . and madame odette in person, so to speak, your excellency, with your permission . . .}
<A>__{a respectful cough at the door reveals an obsequious male shopkeeper. kar enin is bewildered.}

<D>__{i understand. i understand everything. i am going to act. the household arrangements you can leave to me. i will come every day. i will be a second mother to serozha.}
