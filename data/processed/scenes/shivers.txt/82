<L>__{interior stairwell night}
<A>__{as st. luc begins to ascend the stairs, we can see tiny black hooks tearing through forsythe's gag. blood begins to soak through from the inside. a group of residents suddenly appear at the next landing above st. luc and, noticing them, begin to walk down the steps, moaning and crooning and making vaguely sexual gestures toward the pair. blood is now pouring from forsythe's mouth and tentacles are groping for leverage at her cheeks and chin. st. luc decides to attempt to shoulder his way up the stairs, certain that rollo and the police must be at the main doors. as he hits the residents on the stairs, they try to kiss him, caress him, pull his clothes off. they finally manage to drag forsythe from his shoulders, almost unbalancing him as they do so. st. luc tries to prop her up on her feet, but she's completely limp. st. luc holds forsythe against the stairway wall as residents mill all about them. he looks at her in sudden hopelessness.}

<D>__{forsythe! forsythe!}
<A>__{the parasite is now half out of her mouth, hanging through the slit it has torn in her gag. st. luc lets go of forsythe and she sinks to the floor. the residents are swarming all over them. st. luc abandons forsythe and begins to fight his way up the stairs. he runs higher and higher, up flight after flight of stairs, until he is free of the slow moving residents. he leans back against a wall, panting. crooning and moaning echo up to him from below. he leans over the railing and looks down. in the stairwell several flights below, forsythe lies surrounded by milling residents, legs spread as though about to give birth. a resident leans over and pulls the parasite from her mouth, then swallows it whole with gusto. other residents touch her, stroke her, caress her, as though offering her a strange kind of comfort. st. luc reels with disgust and disbelief. he turns and runs.}
