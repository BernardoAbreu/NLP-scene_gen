<L>__{interior swiss bank day}
<A>__{bill and julie, looking jet lagged, sit across a desk from a swiss banker. he seems to be about 100 years old. he's reading a huge stack of paperwork with a magnifying glass, mouthing along in french. it's taking him a long time. they wait patiently til their patience runs out.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{as we discussed, this is an urgent matter.}
<A>__{the banker puts up a finger to "shush" him. then looks back to the paperwork, then licks his finger to turn the page. he licks his finger again, but can't get the page to turn. he feebly gets up, and shuffles across the room to a water cooler. he fills a paper cup with water and shuffles back to his desk. he dips his finger in the water to turn the page.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{can't you call somebody? do something to get us around all this paperwork?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{sorry. not in switzerland, i can't.}
<A>__{bill can't stand it anymore. he jumps to his feet.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{this is absurd. if we can't get some faster service, we're going to have to file a complainterior}
