<A>__{bruce draws the curtains, sets an alarm clock. the current time is 7:09 pm. he sits cross legged on the floor, slumps forward slightly, and closes his eyes. he inhales, exhales, taking deep, regular breaths. his muscles relax. ten seconds later, bruce has plunged into deep sleep. time passes. the clock shows 7:19, 7:32. at 7:44 we track in on bruce's unconscious face, drawing closer and closer until his eyelids fill the frame, twitching with the irregular movement characteristic of r.e.m. sleep. without warning his eyes snap open. hold on bruce's gaze grim, alert, determined as the clock hits 7:45. an alarm sounds, breaking the silence with its grating electronic whine.}
