<A>__{ted's parents and jimmy walk through the front door. they're stunned to find a huge 24x36 enlarged family portrait, hanging over the mantle. it's the same picture ted broke in his childish tantrum. mom and dad are moved. even more so when they see ted. waiting for them on the couch. ted rises. misty eyed.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{everything i am is because of you. can you ever forgive me?}
<C>__{mom}
<P>__{(hugging him)}
<D>__{oh, teddy. we missed you so much.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{you were always our number one son.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(rolling his eyes)}
<D>__{mom, dad. this display of unconditional love is appalling.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{we are a family.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{a family, need i remind you, that he ridiculed and left for dead.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{shut your pie hole, jimmy.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i will not have my boys arguing.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{so, when i'm seventeen, can i turn everyone's life upside down, behave like a total piece of canine excrement, and then wipe the slate clean with a half baked apology and a kodak moment? mom & dad no!}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{which is precisely why i got the rights to my new room in writing.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(to his parents)}
<D>__{i need your help. i'm really in deep shit.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{don't say "shit," honey. use the strong vocabulary god gave you.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{besides, there's no problem too deep or too shitty for us to solve.}
