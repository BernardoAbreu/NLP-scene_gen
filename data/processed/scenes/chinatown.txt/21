<A>__{loach tries to ease him down the path.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{before what? what the hell's going on?}
<A>__{at the sound of his raised voice, a man standing at the edge of the channel, talking to two boys in swimming trunks, turns around. he's a tall, sleek mexican in his early thirties,}
<B>__{luis escobar.}
<A>__{both gittes and escobar register considerable surprise at seeing one another. the men around them are extremely uneasy. loach is actually sweating. finally, escobar smiles.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{hello, jake.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(without smiling)}
<D>__{how are you, lou?}

<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{summer colds are the worst.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{yeah, they are.}
<A>__{gittes reaches into his pocket, pulls out his cigarette case.}
<C>__{a fireman}
<D>__{no smoking, sir. it's a fire hazard this time of year.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{i think we can make an exception. i will see he's careful with the matches.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(lighting up)}
<D>__{thanks, lou.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{how'd you get past the guards?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{well, to tell you the truth, i lied a little.}
<A>__{escobar nods. they walk a couple of steps. the other police, two plainclothesmen and a uniformed officer, watch them.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{you've done well by yourself.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i get by.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and i guess you have.}
<C>__{loach}
<D>__{poking around in other people's dirty linen.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{yeah. tell me, you still throw chinamen into jail for spitting on the laundry?}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{you're behind the times, jake. they've got steam irons now.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{and i'm out of chinatown.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{since when?}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{since i made lieutenant.}
<A>__{it's apparent gittes is impressed despite himself.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{congratulations.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{uh huh. so what are you doing here?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{looking for someone.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{hollis mulwray. you seen him?}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{oh yes.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i'd like to talk to him.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{you're welcome to try. there he is.}
<A>__{escobar points down to the reservoir. a couple of men using poles with hooks are fishing about in the water. it can be seen that one of them has hooked something. he shouts. the other man hooks it, too. they pull, revealing the soaking back of a man's coat. they start to pull the body into the skiff.}
