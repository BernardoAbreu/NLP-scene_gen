<L>__{interior the club night}
<A>__{a long view from doyle's position of the room, a quick certain survey that stumbles twice; on laughter that seems too raw and then over a flurry of activity by waiters and captains serving a table on the main floor. doyle's attention is apprehended by the noise and activity that emanate from the same large table.}

<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{what about the last of the big time spenders. you make him?}
<A>__{russo's eyes come off the show. it is a direct line from doyle's gaze to the round, ruddy and arrogant face of sal boca, the apparent host of the table of eight men and women, the men in dinner jackets with ties tucked under the collars of blue or white lace trimmed shirts, the women in a mixture of pant suits and catskills cocktail party dresses, their hair coiffed towers.}
<C>__{russo}
<D>__{no, you?}
<C>__{doyle}

<C>__{russo}
<D>__{he probably sells insurance. owns a chicken farm in hackensack.}
<A>__{zoom in slowly on sal as he deals tips and orders. through doyle's eyes, we go from guest to guest at sal's table, taking apart their manners and styles as they talk and laugh, lost in the show chatter.}
