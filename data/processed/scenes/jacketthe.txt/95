<A>__{dr. lorenson and dr. gries are walking briskly to a meeting.}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{we're late.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{maybe it's not such a waste.}
<A>__{lorenson looks at gries askance before she sets the record straight.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{it's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{they don't care about all the things we do right. [beat] but they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [beat] that's what they should come here to look for.}
<A>__{lorenson can see gries is trying to tell her something.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{what should they be looking for?}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{they should just be looking harder.}
<A>__{lorenson grabs gries' arm, sensing the import of her words.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{where? [beat] it's becker isn't it? he's doing stuff, isn't he?}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{later. i will tell you about it later. we got a session to catch now.}
