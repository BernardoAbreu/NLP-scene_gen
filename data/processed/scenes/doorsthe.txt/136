<L>__{interior stage same night}
<A>__{the doors come out finally. the noise is overwhelming. acid, light, noise. wagnerian gods, hitler... jim spreading his arms like icarus set to fly. the roars redouble, their feet stomping out:}
<C>__{crowd}
<P>__{(insane)}
<D>__{doors doors doors doors...}
<A>__{joints are thrown by the dozen on the stage at jim's feet. he is a god now as he bends regally, picks one up. cops everywhere looking as... he lights it. the crowd going nuts as the doors go into the ominous introductory strains of five to one trying to get the onus off jim and the show on the road. the audience knows the song, go into a primal foot stomp with it. bras are thrown on stage. kids writhe madly in the primal doors dance. people with sparklers running through the hangar. camera flashbulbs popping throughout the show... get jim on film while you can. jim, drunk, high, smoking the jay, won't go into the lyrics right off, forcing the doors to circle the beat again. he jerks his hand back from the mike as if it were a hot wire.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{are you ready!!!!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you reaaaaaaadyyyyyyyyy!!}
<A>__{the crowd explodes once more. as a cop heads upstage to get jim for the joint he cooly flicks it back into the crowd, avoiding disaster. perfect timing as the cop looks around, suddenly distracted by: the crowd yelling something. an insane teenager stands on the railing of a balcony above the auditorium, poised to swan dive some 18 feet into the crowd. which he now does, arms held out like wings. the crowd yells, parting to allow his bulk to smack the floor. pause. cops rushing to the spot. the kid suddenly stands up, unhurt, with a stoned out look on his face.}
<C>__{teenager}
<D>__{wow!}
<A>__{then splits at a full run thru the crowd chased by the perplexed cops. everybody surging back towards the stage as jim looses one of his primal screams.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{yaaaaaoooooooooowwwwww... love my girl!}
<P>__{(song)}
<D>__{five to one one in five no one here gets out alive you gets your baby i will get mine gonna make it, baby if we try}
<A>__{he slobbers, drunk, slouches, stumbles, regains his balance. the crowd loves it, but ray senses something wrong. robbie starts to feel the effects of the acid jim gave him his eyes registering fear.}
<D>__{jim & doors the old get old the young get stronger may take a week and it may take longer they got the guns but we got the numbers gonna win yeah we're taking over!!}
<A>__{during the instrumental break, jim picks up one of the roses from the floor, pokes it at john on the drums, who whacks it to death on his skins. jim starts to whirl the mike cord like a slingshot or bolo, in an ever widening arc... ...it flies off and smashes into the head of the promoter at the edge of the stage arguing with siddons. the man is staggered, weaving, siddons helping him to a first aid team.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{yaaaaaaoooooowwwwwww!!!}
<A>__{the crazy vegeterian hippie runs out on stage to give jim the white lamb to make this political pointerior jim holds the lamb in his arms. it's purring, gentle. dog chases the hippie off as he gives the microphone back to jim and takes the lamb from him... he staggers over to robbie and goes down to his knees, pretending to give him head on his frantic stoned guitar solo.}
<D>__{jim & doors your ballroom days are over baby night is drawing near shadows of the evening crawl across the years you walk across the floor with a flower in your hand tryin to tell me no one understands}
<A>__{photographers flashing cameras. baker urging him on from the wings as he passes out. a girl runs onto the stage, dumps a bottle of champagne on jim's head. jim takes his shirt off, soaking wet. the crowd is also stripping in the heat, shirts, blouses, screaming so much now they are obviously way past listening to any song. it has become a view of the future the naked girl and boy dancing stark naked drugged out in the middle of it all, the fat girl prowling naked on the edge of the stage before she's arrested, the fights in the crowd, fists, blood, a black man chased and beaten, the sense of altamont here, the hippie flower trip gone to shit it's all come down here tonight, the end of an era.}
<D>__{jim & doors trade in your hours for a handful of dimes gonna make it baby in our prime get together one more time get together}
<A>__{he stops singing suddenly, squinting out into the madness. the arena echoes with the uncomprehending chant of the mob...}
<C>__{mob}
<D>__{...one more time get together one more time get together one more time}
<A>__{special effect the indian ghost is leaving jim's body spectrally moving off him, hovering there in the air, its eyes the face of a dying indian on an arizona highway then gone. a moment, only three, four beats. an optical illusion? maybe. or is it saying, 'now you are just a white man'... maybe not. as it drifts off in a cloud, into the vast audience's eyeball.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you're all a buncha fuckin slaves!!!}
