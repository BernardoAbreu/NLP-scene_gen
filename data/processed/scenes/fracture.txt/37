<L>__{interior forensics lab later}
<A>__{marchand, senior s.i.d. (scene investigation division) tech, works as he talks into a speaker phone. he and willy have teamed up often, and an underlying respect lets them mock each other.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{marchand.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{it's willy slocum. what's up?}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{your gun in that palisades shooting is no good.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{how can the gun be "no good"?}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{it's a perfectly good weapon. a heckler & koch nine millimeter. it's just no good as evidence. it's never been fired.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{it's the gun from the scene?}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{yep. bought by mr. thomas crawford and registered to his wife, about a month ago. apparently a gift.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{and between the shooting and arrest, this guy was locked inside his house.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{is that a question?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{no, i mean, just: what's the point? playing games with the gun. he's alone in the house with the victim, and he confessed it's not like the gun's gonna get him off the hook.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{do you have a question i can answer?}
<A>__{beat. willy shakes the puzzle off, irritated:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{look, our weapon is in that house somewhere. get a team out to search it tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{ya think?}
<C>__{willy}
<P>__{(sighs, smiles)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he shuts the phone. takes a moment, looking around again at where he is. absently tugs at his tie and vest, lets the case go. heads in to the opera.}
