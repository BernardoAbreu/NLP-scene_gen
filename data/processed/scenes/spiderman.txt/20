<L>__{interior large computer lab night}
<A>__{it is dark and empty except for computers. sitting at it, lit by the glow of its screen, is solomon rosomorf (roz). as he works, a door opens behind him. someone walks quietly through the lab. rosomorf keeps working. the intruder approaches...}
<C>__{thorkel}
<P>__{(at his ear)}
<D>__{professor rosomorf, what happened here?}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{someone tried to rob me of some paper... i suspect they were looking for that one.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{roz}
<P>__{(unruffled)}
<D>__{award winning stuff.}
<P>__{(turning slightly)}
<D>__{peter parker's data on the planetary conjunction. damn lucky i hid it in my computer under another title.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{my god, what's going on in our school? first professor octavius almost blows up the physics lab... now this. you report it in triplicate, of course.}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{thorkel, be careful when you talk to octavius. remember... the man is a very fragile genius. one day he'll bring us all the noble prize.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{rosomorf, the man is a very dangerous crackpot!}
<A>__{off screen the voice of the cyclotron whine begins to build.}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{that's him again. he's working day and night.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{i tell you the man is very dangerous.}
<P>__{(the whine grows louder)}
<D>__{come on rosomorf, let's stop him before this building will explode.}
