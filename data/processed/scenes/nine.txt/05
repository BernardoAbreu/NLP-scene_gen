<L>__{interior wardrobe, cinecitta day}
<A>__{guido comes through the door, blows hard from the barrage. they're in lilli's domain here, and a haven, always, for guido. part edith head, part coco chanel, lilli is guido's costume designer, no longer young, cranky, indomitable, sharp as a tack. she adores guido without any sentiment. she's incapable of sentiment. guido heads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting some fabric.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{i need a cigarette.}
<A>__{dante comes in, closing the door behind him.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{he needs a shirt and tie, lilli.}
<A>__{guido sits up on lilli's table, as dante heads to lilli's desk and picks up the phone to make a call.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{i need a coffee and a cigarette.}
<A>__{he lies down.}
<C>__{lilli}
<P>__{(unimpressed)}
<D>__{answer a question, i will give you a coffee. answer another question, i will give you a cigarette. and so on.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{actually and an aspirin.}
<A>__{dante stands at lilli's desk and looks at some drawings.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(in the background, on the phone)}
<D>__{we're running late...}
<C>__{lilli}
<P>__{(turns to guido and lights a cigarette)}
<D>__{calm down. directing a movie is a very overrated job, we all know it. you just have to say yes or no. what else do you do? nothing. maestro should this be red? yes. green? no. more extras? yes. more lipstick? no. yes, no, yes, no, yes, no that's directing.}
<A>__{lilli hands guido the lit cigarette.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{that's right: that's directing. and it doesn't seem to make a blind bit of difference, finally, what the answer is...}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{so please, guido, yes or no, do you want any costumes in this film?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{you see simple!}
<P>__{(handing him an espresso}
<D>__{fetched by her assistant,}
<P>__{roberta)}
<D>__{might i know what period the movie's in?}
<A>__{lilli glances at dante who has edged closer to the table, he looks at the costumes.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{yes, yes.}
<P>__{(downs the espresso)}
<D>__{soon.}
<A>__{lilli glares at dante, ushering him away.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{you know i don't allow producers in here.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{alright. two minutes guido.}
<A>__{lilli is the only person who intimidates dante. he leaves. guido pulls out his own tie from his pocket. lilli walks round and takes the tie off him. guido sits up. lilli puts the tie round his neck.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{he's gone. have you written a word of the script?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{are you in a panic?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{she ties guido's tie for him.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{is luisa going with you to the press conference?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{no. nobody. dante. and his spy.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{you need to shave. you look terrible.}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(looking around, desperate)}
<D>__{why is there no fire escape in here? what if somebody needed to escape? i can't face these reporters. i have nothing to say.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{you'll be fine. you're a world class liar, darling, go out there and lie for italy, lie for italia.}
