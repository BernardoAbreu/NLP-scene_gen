<A>__{george is led into the room where three fbi men await him. one of them is named fred garcia.}
<C>__{garcia}
<D>__{how are you doing, george?}

<D>__{what do you guys want?}
<C>__{garcia}
<D>__{you hear about your old friend, diego?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what about him?}
<A>__{garcia tosses a newspaper onto the table. the miami herald. inside is a full page letter addressed from diego delgado to vice president george bush. in the letter, diego offers to make a deal. in exchange for immunity, diego will rat out the entire cocaine business. americans, colombians, noriega, escobar, everybody. just let him free.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{what the fuck? is he going to walk?}
<C>__{garcia}
<D>__{he's going down, george. it's election year. we're not making any deals. fbi guy #1 he's never getting out. orders from the top.}
<C>__{garcia}
<D>__{so, how would you like to help us put him away? fbi guy #2 we've done our homework. we know you hate this motherfucker.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{garcia}
<D>__{don't be stupid, george. we've got him. we've got him dead to rights. but like i said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. and the first one's got your name on it. cut your sentence in half, maybe more.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no thanks, fellas. you've got the wrong fucking guy. i'm not a rat.}
