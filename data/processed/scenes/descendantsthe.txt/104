<A>__{brian sweeps his hand around the room.}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{here it is.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{how did you meet? i'm curious.}
<A>__{for a moment brian looks tricked, as if matt really did just want a tour of the house.}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{i can't do this.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{neither can i. how did you meet?}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{i thought you said you came here just to tell me.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i changed my mind. and i can't very well ask her the details. how'd you meet?}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{at a party.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what party?}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{super bowl party.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(figuring it out)}
<D>__{at the mitchells'.}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{does that help? does that make it better?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hey, i'm doing you a favor here. i could go out there right now and fuck you up, so get a better attitude. then what? how'd you get the nerve to ask her out?}
<A>__{brian drops his head, rubs his temples.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{i want to know what makes a person cross that line. was it about the deal? is that when you decided she was for you?}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{no, no. it's not what you think. it just happened.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{nothing just happens.}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{everything just happens.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{was she going to leave me?}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{she would have. but i, i, uh... i didn't want that. that wouldn't have happened. i love julie.}
<P>__{(anguished)}
<D>__{please don't tell her. please. i don't know what i've done. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{did she say she loved you?}
<A>__{brian nods slightly.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{do you love her?}
<A>__{brian looks down.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{you don't love her. you don't love her. you just used her to get to me.}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{no, i told you. i wasn't trying to get to you.}
<C>__{brian speer }
<D>__{it was an affair, an attraction. sex. and she got sort of... carried away with the whole thing, and i guess i went with it. i mean, i didn't exactly say no to things. i should have. i love my family.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{then i guess it's all working out. her lips are sealed, and you don't have to go through the trouble of dumping her.}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{hey, hey, that's really unfair. i had have a lot of respect for her. she's a wonderful woman.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{too bad her husband found out. you can't win `em all. one more question. have you ever been inside my bedroom?}
<C>__{brian speer}
<P>__{(tortured)}
<D>__{once.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you could have had the decency to lie about that one. well, she's in queen's hospital if you want to say goodbye. that really is all i came to say.}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{shouldn't you be with her?}
<A>__{matt's face slackens into overwhelming sadness.}
