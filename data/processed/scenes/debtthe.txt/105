<A>__{she looks up at him. he stares into her eyes. beat. then, suddenly he kisses her. it's what she's waited so long for and she's stunned for a moment, then puts her arms around his neck, returning the kiss hungrily. they are helpless with desire for one another. there is a sudden scratch of a key at the front door and, instinctively, the two break apart. stephan enters, hair wet from the rain. he stops, seeing them, sensing the atmosphere. they stare back at him. rachel steps away a little, wiping her face.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{what did they say?}

<A>__{stephan is hurriedly screwing the silencer onto the gun. there's another knock at the door.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{stephan!}
<A>__{stephan walks into the living room and aims the gun at vogel. vogel instinctively squirms away, falling to one side, wriggling back as far as he can.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{if it's them, he dies.}

<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{rachel. rachel!}
<A>__{from the hallway we hear the sound of the door being opened the murmur of conversation. the two men stand frozen, listening. vogel lies, breathing hard through his nose. we hear the door close. the three listen as footsteps approach down the hall... rachel walks back in. a long beat.}
