<L>__{interior english class morning}
<A>__{the kids pass back paperback copies of to kill a mockingbird. charlie opens his trapper keeper, takes a pencil out of the plastic pouch, and writes... "english class... day one."}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{my last class of the day is advanced english, and i'm excited to finally start learning with the smartest kids in the school...}
<A>__{a smart ass freshman girl with braces smiles at him.}
<C>__{smart ass freshman}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{nice trapper keeper, faggot.}
<A>__{the kids around him laugh. charlie's ears turn red. at the blackboard, the teacher writes his name... mr. anderson. but you can call him bill (27). bill is an idealist.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{shhh. i'm mr. anderson. and thanks to teach for america, i'm going to be your teacher for freshman english. this semester, we're going to be learning harper lee's to kill a mockingbird. genius book. now, who wants to get out of the first pop quiz?}
<A>__{all hands go up. except charlie's. bill paces the rows.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{i'm shocked. alright. you can skip the quiz if you tell me which author invented the paperback book. anyone?}
<A>__{as kids think, bill confiscates contraband, removes hats.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{he's british. he also invented the serial. in fact, at the end of chapter 3 of his first novel, he had a man hanging off a cliff by his fingernails. hence, the term cliffhanger. anybody?}
<C>__{freshman girl}
<D>__{shakespeare.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's a great guess, but no, shakespeare didn't write novels. anybody else?}
<P>__{(off their silence)}
<D>__{the author was...}
<A>__{bill is about to give the answer when he notices charlie has already written... charles dickens.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{... charles dickens. however, if you and i had gone to a play in shakespeare's time, it would have cost 4 pennies. can you imagine that? we would have put those pennies in a metal box, which the ushers would lock in the office. and that's where we get the term... anyone?}
<C>__{kids }
<D>__{"office depot!" "office supplies!"}
<A>__{charlie writes down box office, then looks up to find that bill is staring at him. waiting for him to raise his hand.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i will give you a free "a" on anything but the final term paper if you get it right.}
<A>__{charlie looks down. he's not going to answer.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{box office.}
<A>__{the kids groan. they should have known. charlie smiles to himself. he's going to like this class.}
