<L>__{interior hotel room}
<A>__{rath is leaning back in the bed, nikita purring in his lap. he did not sleep last night and is very tired. his eyes fight to stay open. the sound of the television momentarily hangs in the hotel room as he sleeps. the program is a spanish dubbed version of goldfinger. the door bangs open and rath springs off the bed, a gun flashing in his hand, leveling it at a dazed, blinking electra. rath sighs slowly, letting the hammer of the gun click back into place.}
