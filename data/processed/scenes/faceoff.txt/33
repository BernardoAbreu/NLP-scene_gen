<L>__{exterior archer home night}
<A>__{archer slowly gets out of his car. trudging toward the front door, he picks up a basketball and takes a shot. his form is terrible he misses by a mile.}
<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{archer passes jamie's room. loud music pounds from within. he pauses to knock, thinks again, then heads down the hall.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{eve is in bed. archer comes in quietly and sits beside her studying her peaceful, sleeping face. she stirs.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i was dreaming...}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{something good?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i'm not sure... you were flying this weird old stunt plane... doing flips... walking on the wings... i was watching from the ground when you fell. you had a parachute, but you wouldn't open it.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{did you catch me?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<P>__{(nuzzles him)}
<D>__{maybe because you've never needed my help.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{come on, you made that up, didn't you?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{... maybe i did...}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{... maybe i didn't...}
<A>__{they kiss affectionately. passion building, eve runs her hands over his body until her fingers touch a round scar on his chest. archer freezes mid caress.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{it's all right, jon.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{after all these years, i still can't get it out of my head an inch to the left, matty would still be alive.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{and you wouldn't be.}
<A>__{no response. the pain hidden in his silence chills eve.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{things will get better now that you're home. everything will be better now that... that man is finally out of our lives.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{eve...}
<A>__{he starts to say the words. he wants, needs to share the truth with her. but he can't. instead }
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{... if i had to do something to find some closure... i should do it, shouldn't i?... no matter how crazy?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oh, god you're going on assignment again...}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{one last time. and while i'm gone, i want you and jamie to go to your mother's. it's important...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you said you'd be here! you promised! what could be more important than that?}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{i can't tell you... except only i can do it.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you want me to tell you it's okay to leave? okay, go on! go!}
<A>__{fury erupting, eve pushes archer out of the bed.}
