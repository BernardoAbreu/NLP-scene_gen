<A>__{the sword starts to hum and to heat up. from the hilt outward the blade glows brighter and brighter: red, orange, white. it lights up the room, throwing long shadows into the corners. galen lays the white hot steel on the anvil. simon takes up his hammer and begins the reforging. valerian sees their resolve. after watching for several moments she slips out the side door, looking sad.}
