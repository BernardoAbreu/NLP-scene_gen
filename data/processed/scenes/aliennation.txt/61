<A>__{jetson, looking bizarre in his ear protectors, is taking careful aim with his .38 as sykes walks up. jetson slips the protectors down.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{well, let's see what you got, cochise. gimme six, rapid fire.}
<A>__{jetson, a little nervous at this command performance, turns, sets, and fires at the silhouette target. it's a large, sloppy grouping.}
<C>__{sykes}

<A>__{sykes raises the casull, fires. ka boom!!! the shell rockets clean through the bullet proof vest on the target form. the recoil slams sykes back, jerks his arm up. ka boom!!! again, and another hole is drilled through the vest. other shooters look over. sykes sets the gun down... sees his hand is bleeding. jetson absorbs all this, as we }
