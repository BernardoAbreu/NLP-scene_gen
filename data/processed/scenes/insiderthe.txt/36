<L>__{interior thomas sandefur's office, brown & williamson day}
<C>__{thomas sandefur}
<P>__{(re: his distraction)}
<D>__{sorry. i'm accepting an award from the retinitis pigmentosa foundation. it's going to kill the rest of my day.}
<A>__{thomas sandefur is absorbed in spreadsheets of regional sales figures. dark pouches are under his eyes. he doesn't look up. he doesn't look healthy. we're in a luxurious office with a view of louisville. jeffrey is waiting in a chair. sandefur is brown & williamson's ceo. two lawyers, their briefcases, like weapons, close at hand, sit on a couch. their jackets are off. they wear expensive shirts.}
<C>__{thomas sandefur }
<P>__{(finishing; looking up at jeffrey)}
<D>__{so. you had a chance to play golf?}
<A>__{surprisingly affable, sandefur prides himself on his salesman's sunny manners. he has a mellifluous georgia accent...}
<C>__{thomas sandefur }
<P>__{(to the lawyers)}
<D>__{jeff's a premiere golfer... what are you, a two handicap?}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(precise)}
<D>__{seven...}
<C>__{thomas sandefur}
<P>__{(to lawyer)}
<D>__{and, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. he has more concentration than anybody i've ever met. it's spooky how he can concentrate.}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{i'd rather play than talk about it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what did you want to see me about? i don't like being back here.}
<A>__{sandefur smiles, used to him.}
<C>__{thomas sandefur}
<D>__{jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. most people consider what they're saying...social skills... jeffrey just charges right ahead.}
<P>__{(smiles, after a beat)}
<D>__{now, i know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with brown & williamson, jeff...}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{chapter and verse.}
<C>__{thomas sandefur}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{yeah, i know you do...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know, i came up through sales. one of the reasons i was a great salesman, was i never made a promise i couldn't keep.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i knew that if i ever broke my promise i'd suffer the consequence...}
<A>__{and there's a warning behind it...}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(contained)}
<D>__{is that a threat?}
<C>__{thomas sandefur}
<D>__{...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny...any more than are one's family matters...}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you threatening my family, now, too?}
<C>__{thomas sandefur}
<D>__{now, don't be paranoid, jeff.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{about the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{"research..."}
<P>__{(smile + scorn)}
<D>__{you declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...}
<C>__{thomas sandefur}
<D>__{that's why we hire scientists...}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(interrupts, direct)}
<D>__{okay.}
<P>__{(a beat, honest)}
<D>__{i don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. i was paid well for my work. the health and welfare benefits are good. the severance package is fair. i have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which i said i wouldn't.}
<C>__{thomas sandefur}
<D>__{i appreciate all that, jeff. but, upon reflection...we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.}
<A>__{and there's a seriousness that weighs heavily on the room...}
<C>__{thomas sandefur }
<D>__{so we've drafted a supplement to your agreement...it broadly defines and expands in more detail what is "confidential." nobody will be able to say, "well, hell's bells, margaret, i didn't know that was a secret..."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we're very serious about protecting our interests.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{we'd like you to sign it.}
<A>__{and he's acutely aware of the threat behind it...}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{and if i don't?}
<C>__{a lawyer}
<P>__{(speaking for sandefur)}
<D>__{if we "arrive" at the conclusion you're acting in bad faith? we would terminate, right now, payouts under your severance package. you and your family's medical benefits. and initiate litigation against you, mr. wigand. wigand dr . wigand.}
<C>__{a lawyer}
<P>__{(a beat) dr . wigand...after you've examined the}
<D>__{document, you will see it is in your own best interest and you'll sign it.}
<A>__{jeffrey slowly turns to face the attorney. and we see on his face the true nature of this man.}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{so, what you are saying is: it isn't enough that you fired me. for no good reason! now you question my integrity? on top of the humiliation of being fired? you threaten me?! you threaten my family?!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it never crossed my mind not to honor my agreement...}
<P>__{(turning, to sandefur)}
<D>__{but i will tell you, mr. sandefur, and brown & williamson, too... fuck me?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{well, fuck you!!}
<A>__{and with that he gets up, and leaves... and it's quiet...}
<C>__{a lawyer}
<D>__{i'm not sure he got the message...}
<C>__{thomas sandefur}
<P>__{(with total confidence)}
<D>__{oh, i think he did.}
