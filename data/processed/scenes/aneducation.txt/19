<D>__{jenny and david walk toward the beautiful hall. jenny suddenly looks young in the dress that looks too old for her other adults are milling around outside, and the women don't look like girls dressed up. david makes for an incredibly glamorous and attractive couple in their late twenties who are waiting outside danny and helen. helen is as far from anyone's idea of an aunt as one can get. she's no more beautiful than jenny, but she's dressed both appropriately and spectacularly, in early 60s, pre hippy bohemian gear. she turns heads in a way that jenny is not yet able to. danny too is attractive, but soberly so. david and jenny are, in a way, paler, less striking versions of these two.}

<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i was hoping we'd miss the beginning, and then it wouldn't be worth going in, and we could go off dancing or something.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{helen is one of the more reluctant members of tonight's audience. jenny and david laugh politely.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{jenny, these are my friends helen and danny.}
<A>__{jenny shakes hands with the two of them. they both give her fascinated and clearly appraising looks. they have heard about her.}
<C>__{david }
