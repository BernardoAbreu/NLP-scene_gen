<L>__{exterior bridge on base trail day}
<A>__{mike and sheryl hike over a small wooden bridge.}
<L>__{exterior base trail #2 day}
<A>__{mike and sheryl reach a small clearing. there are a number of signs pointing toward different trails. (donner trail, willow creek bridge, timber falls, etc.) sheryl grabs the map and some water. mike swigs some water, munches on trail mix, takes a peek in the guidebook.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{what do you think? "cannibal" trail or the other one?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{guidebook says a couple of these other trails lead to some pretty sweet views.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{we're not lewis and or clark. we're gonna stick to one of the ones the ranger said.}
<C>__{ida }
<D>__{you folks need some help?}
<A>__{ida foster, 40s, approaches, wheeling some supplies in a handmade wagon. she is worn, haggard, but has a friendly, smile. she wears a flannel shirt, old jeans and dirty boots.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we're just going over our options here.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{well, take it from me, any way you choose, you can't go wrong.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{the ranger at base suggested donner trail or...}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{...willow creek bridge. i think sam only knows those two trails. well. between those, i'd pick donner trail. willow creek will shoot you to the top, but there's not as much to see. donner weaves through peddler's point, it's a better hike and prettier all around view.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<P>__{(to mike)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{then, she notices a ring on sheryl's finger.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{that's a pretty ring.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{not your traditional wedding ring, but it's all the same in the lord's eyes. how long have you two been wed?}
<A>__{sheryl and mike trade looks.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{oh... we're not married. not yet anyway.}
<A>__{mike shoots her a look: "not yet?"}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{it's a ring my father gave me for graduation.}
<C>__{ida}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. you just looked like you was married is'all. both so beautiful.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm just an old fashioned silly bird. i need to mind my own business.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{no, it's fine.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(changing topics)}
<D>__{which one of those trails got the best clearings?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{clearings? neither will give you much in the way of clearings. but, there's another path, this one here.}
<P>__{(points to the map)}
<D>__{timber falls. its got some beautiful vistas and one of the prettiest falls you'll ever see.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sounds perfect.}
<P>__{(to sheryl)}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{well, i will leave you to it. last thing you need is me fussing'round you, taking you from your private time.}
<C>__{sheryl mike}
<A>__{thank you. yeah, thanks for the tip. ida walks off, but stops only a few feet away.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i'm just gonna say it and go, but if you two were to marry... i bet the lord would bless you with a happy, healthy and handsome child. good luck and god bless you both.}
<A>__{sheryl and mike don't know how to respond. ida leaves. once out of earshot...}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{i suddenly feel the need for confession.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(still lingering on...)}
<D>__{not yet? love taking your shots, don't ya?}
<A>__{sheryl shoots him a stern, but playfully sexy, look.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{when i see an opening.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(checks map)}
<D>__{that path she was talking about winds through these falls. what do you think?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{i think... if you get eaten by a bear and there isn't a ranger around, i'm not carrying what's left of you down this mountain.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{and they say romance is dead.}
<P>__{(smiling wide)}
<D>__{timber falls it is.}
<A>__{they throw on their backpacks and head on their way.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{who's lewis and or clark?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{you really were stoned through high school.}
<A>__{as mike and sheryl trek up the path... angle on the directional sign, "timber falls"}
