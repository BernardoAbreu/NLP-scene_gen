<A>__{jacob looks up at ticker on the wall. mcc $15.13 3.40, acn $10.10 1.96, iss $5.14 1.89. and he stares at that ticker... at the the locust fund's methodical death. suddenly...}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{are you happy?}
<A>__{he stands in the doorway holding a drink.}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{we're done.}
<A>__{and bretton chucks the drink against the wall and the glass shatters. jacob takes a step back. bretton's in a complete state as he walks over to jacob's desk and swipes it clean... papers flying about.}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{finished...}
<A>__{now he picks up the chair...}

<A>__{face full of sweat... blood all over his hand... hair strewn about... completely out of breath... bloodshot red eyes... a beaten down mess of a man.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what happened to composure, bretton?}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{well, i suppose it went to hell with your fucking insurance stocks.}
<A>__{and bretton calms down, walks to the window.}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{it's not making sense to me anymore. the market always made sense to me and for the most part... i was better than it... quicker than it.}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but it's moving too fast now and it looks like the world is going to shit anyway.}

<P>__{(almost to himself)}
<D>__{that's a fortune.}
<A>__{with a shrug...}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{i guess it's all relative.}
