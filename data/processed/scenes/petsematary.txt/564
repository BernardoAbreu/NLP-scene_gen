<A>__{camera holds on louis as those gritting footsteps approach. then we pan to the closet. on the floor is louis's little black bag. we hold on this as the footfalls near. a small white hand enters the frame and pulls the doctor bag out of the closet. now another hand enters the frame and opens the bag. the hands search around inside and bring out a scalpel. they hold it up. the gage thing makes a contented sound.}
