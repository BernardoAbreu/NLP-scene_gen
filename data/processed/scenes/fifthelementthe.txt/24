<D>__{president on line sir..}
<A>__{general staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see the room but not the president.}
<C>__{president }
<D>__{staedert, do you read me?}
<C>__{staedert}
<D>__{i can hear you, mr. president, but i can't see you .}
<A>__{the president grabs the mini camera on his desk and yanks it around to face him. his face fills the screen.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{is that better?}
<C>__{staedert}
<D>__{perfect, mr. president.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{i have to address the supreme council in 10 minutes. just the facts, general.}
<C>__{staedert}
<D>__{there are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{what you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.}
<A>__{consternation reigns in the president's office.}
<C>__{staedert}
<D>__{not yet sir..the only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!}

<C>__{staedert}
<D>__{wait or act.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{recommendations.}
<C>__{staedert}
<D>__{my philosophy mr. president is shoot first ask questions later. i don't like uninvited guests.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{gentlemen?}
<C>__{head chemists}
<D>__{i think it would be foolish to shoot at an organism that seems alive, without first taking the time to study it more! besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{no... it's just getting bigger.}
<C>__{head chemists}
<D>__{so do people, but that's no reason to shoot them.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{the security of the federated territories is and remains number one priority.}
<P>__{(to the military)}
<D>__{i suppose general staedert's "philosophy" is acceptable to you?}
<A>__{all the generals nod "yes"}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{all right, then! staedert?}
<C>__{priest }
<D>__{mr. president?}
<A>__{the president scans the room. staedert remote controls the camera toward the room.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{...yes?}
<A>__{the camera moves up the priest and we finally discover his face. he is in his sixties, a shrewd look in his eyes. around his neck hangs the kommander's finger, the key to the temple.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{cornelius, vito cornelius. 50th level parish. i have a different theory to offer you, mr. president.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{i'm listening.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. because it is evil.. total evil.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(a little sarcastically)}
<D>__{one more reason to shoot first eh?}
<A>__{all the generals nod in agreement.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{evil begets evil, mr. president. shooting would only make it stronger.}
