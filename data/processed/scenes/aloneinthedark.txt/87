<A>__{aline sits at her desk, analyzing the 3 d scan she made of the lynchpin artifact.}
<C>__{hudgens }
<D>__{the abkani never cease to amaze me.}
<A>__{line turns, startled, to see hudgens standing behind her. hudgens demeanor is friendly, reassuring.}
<C>__{hudgens }
<D>__{such a complex society at a time when most of humanity was still hunting and gathering and huddling around fires.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{dr. hudgens. when did you get back?}
<C>__{hudgens}
<D>__{a few hours ago. i heard there was some excitement. are you alright?}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{i'm fine. a bit shaken up. but fine.}
<C>__{hudgens}
<D>__{i apologize for snapping at you earlier. now, what are you still doing here after all you've been through?}
<A>__{hudgens cranes his neck to see aline's computer screen. his eyes light up when he sees the scan of the lynchpin artifact.}
<C>__{hudgens }
<D>__{where did you get that image?}
<A>__{aline hesitates. hudgens looks curious, friendly.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{edward.}
<C>__{hudgens}
<D>__{this is a major find. i will need to analyze it. confirm its authenticity.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{i can do that myself.}
<C>__{hudgens}
<D>__{that wasn't a request...}
<A>__{hudgens stands up to his full height, suddenly menacing.}
<C>__{hudgens }
<D>__{where is the artifact?}
<C>__{agent cheung }
<D>__{everything okay in here?}
<A>__{agent cheung stands at the door, still wearing her full 713 combat gear. her visor is up. she casually holds her rifle.}
<C>__{hudgens}
<D>__{and you are?}
<C>__{agent cheung}
<D>__{ms. cedrac's security detail.}
<C>__{hudgens}
<D>__{my dear, do you have any idea who i...}
<C>__{agent cheung}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{dr. lionel hudgens. former agent, sci and spy division. currently 713 advisor status. i know exactly who you are. but i'm not your "dear" anything.}
<A>__{hudgens looks back at aline and smiles warmly.}
<C>__{hudgens}
<D>__{i will just have to hold off my curiosity until morning.}
<A>__{aline smiles stiffly. hudgens moves to leave.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{dr. hudgens... i forgot to ask. did you find the erebus this time?}
<A>__{hudgens turns back and gives aline another smile.}
<C>__{hudgens}
<D>__{just an empty shipwreck. you were right. it was another wild goosechase.}
<A>__{hudgens exits quickly. aline and agent cheung watch him go.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{since when do i have a security detail?}
<C>__{agent cheung}
<D>__{since it seemed like you needed it.}
