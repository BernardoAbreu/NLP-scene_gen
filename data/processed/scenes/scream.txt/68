<A>__{sid pushes the cart out of the glass door with tatum riding it. the ghost masked figure is nowhere to be found.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what do you think about when you're having sex?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{with stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. but sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, i think about grant goodeve.}
<A>__{sid pushes the cart and tatum across the street.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{grant goodeve the oldest brother on eight is enough. remember that show? he was the one who lived off alone. he would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." he had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from charles in charge. god, i was in love with grant, he was so hot. the show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. grant goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{how does that get you in the mood with stu?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{during foreplay, i sing the theme song to myself. "eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." it's a real turn on.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{grant wrote the song himself. i'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "eight is enough..."}
<A>__{sid pushes the cart up to dewey's jeep. tatum hops off.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what secret meaning? like a satanical thing?}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{watch the show, sid. his basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{tatum!}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{oh, sidney. what? a guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. watch out.}
<A>__{sidney stops just short of a laugh. tatum pulls the back jeep door, loading the groceries in. behind her, the ghost masked figure appears, just out of their sight, behind the jeep's open back door.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{there's that sense of humor. i knew it still existed. ohh, sid, let's have some fun tonight.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{deal.}
<A>__{sidney moves to the back door and closes it shut, when from behind... dewey stands. sid jumps, startled.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{you girls ready.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{looks like i'm your personal bodyguard tonight, sid.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{no, dewey. you'll ruin the whole night.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{sorry, police orders. i will stay out of the way, i promise.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{tatum kicks the shopping cart out of the way, blindly. it rolls down the road by itself, gaining speed on a decline running smack into the ghost masked figure who stops the cart cold with one hand.}
