<L>__{exterior hotel courtyard day}
<A>__{mariachi rushes out the door, he looks down and sees the mean dudes entering the courtyard. he ducks his head back just as they look up to see him. mariachi runs up a smal flight of steps, where he then tosses his guitar onto a balcony, which he then jumps over to himself. the men rush up the steps shooting at the balcony. bullets narrowly miss mariachi as he climbs over the balcony to safety.}
