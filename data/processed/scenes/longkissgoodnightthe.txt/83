<A>__{carnival rides, dead for the winter. henessey and charly stroll beneath them. he smokes. she eats chinese.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{ugh. god i'm full, i'm gonna have a food baby.}
<A>__{he takes a good long look at her, still can't fathom it.}

<D>__{"charly." fucking unbelievable.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{shame about the fat ass. i bet you were really attractive once.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{oh, i was. check this out. one time? a guy said he'd fuck me.}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{charly}

<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{did he make good?}
<C>__{charly}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i said, "go back to your room. dad..."}
<A>__{she laughs through a swig of beer. memory flash: charly's bedroom as dad puts the gun to his head and fires, crack...}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{it's why he thought i had him killed.}
<A>__{henessey huddles, watching her closely.}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{your father was murdered.}
<A>__{she nods, gazes out over the icy waters. speaks, her voice faraway and gone:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{when da died, i went to his funeral. 12 years old, today i wouldn't. and i overheard a woman, she was praying... she was thanking god sounded so happy thanking him it hadn't been her father who was killed. see... she didn't really care that god had let someone die... just so long as it missed her.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...and she bought her cross at the same store as mine, see, that's what we do, we all pray to the same cross on a hundred different walls, and sit back and wait to see who gets hit and who gets missed.}
<A>__{anger flares in her eye. like a stirring of mud at the bottom of a deep, deep, pond.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{fuck the waiting. fuck being afraid. i determine who gets hit, and how hard. and i thank no one. it's pathetic to thank someone who spares you when they're just taking someone else.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{walk me upstairs?}
