<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior wilderness night}
<A>__{mist. dark trees. dripping vines. an engine rumbles in the distance. the full moon shimmers on a puddle. a frog splats in, splashing a one man pup tent.}
<B>__{inside the tent}
<A>__{luke's eyes pop open, disoriented, realizing he's fallen asleep reading by flashlight. he's nineteen, still slightly awkward and unaware he's growing handsome. he listens as the engine rumbles louder, closer. he peers out through the tent flap. glaring head lamps roar toward him. scrambling out of his sleeping bag, he hurls himself against the side of the tent, as...}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{an rv camper nearly plows down the tent, skidding to a stop in the mud. stillness. luke extricates himself from the tent. he runs to the driver side window of the rv.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<A>__{inside, alexa, thirties, earthy, looks up at him bleary eyed. she nods 'yes.'}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{how did you even get here? there's no road.}
<C>__{alexa}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm from utah.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<C>__{alexa}
<D>__{are you alone out here?}
<A>__{he nods 'yes.' she bursts into tears.}
<C>__{alexa }
<D>__{my husband. bastard. i've been driving for days. i don't even know where i'm going.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, wow. i'm really sorry.}
<A>__{she gathers herself, sniffling.}
<D>__{i have warm apple kringel in the camper. would you like some?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{uh, what is it?}
<C>__{alexa}
<D>__{pastry.}
<B>__{inside rv camper}
<A>__{luke stands at the rv's tiny kitchen counter, wolfing pastry off a paper plate.}
<C>__{alexa}
<D>__{so, this "survival quest" is your vacation?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah. it's my third try. kind a' lame, huh?}
<C>__{alexa}
<D>__{no. seven days alone in the wilderness? i'd be afraid.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it's just something i really wanted to do.}
<A>__{luke notices an odd pile of stuff by the sink.}
<C>__{alexa}
<D>__{his shoes. fishing lures. the electric drill.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{she smiles, grateful, eyeing his torn t shirt and shorts.}
<C>__{alexa}
<D>__{you're all wet and muddy. why don't i hang those up to dry?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{thanks. i'm okay.}
<C>__{alexa}
<D>__{i'm propositioning you.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh... oh, wow. you are?}
<A>__{he considers, fearful, but thrilled.}
<L>__{exterior langford university morning}
<A>__{students crisscross on bikes in front of the quadrangle. the huge round headlights and muscular front grill of an old semi truck rumbles up to the curb. it's the cab only, like the sliced off front of a train engine. luke hops down, startling his friends, keenan and janine, passionately making out on the sidewalk. twenty, brainy and athletic, janine adjusts her glasses, the only remnant of a bookish past, as she thoughtfully considers luke's massive truck.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{it's remarkable. sort of retro. i thought you were gettin' a pickup?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i changed my mind.}
<A>__{hoping for a more enthusiastic response, he turns to keenan, who climbs up and peeks inside the cab. he's rugged, streetwise, perpetually bemused, maybe ed norton and bill murray had a son...}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{it's awesome. it's pleather.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{fuck you. you think it's stupid.}
<A>__{janine stares at him.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{she shrugs, trying to put her finger on it, and when luke rolls up his t shirt sleeves, she grins.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{oh my god. you got laid. finally! who is she?}
<A>__{luke glares at keenan.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i didn't say a word! i swear! you know janine. she's got x ray vision.}
<P>__{(to janine)}
<D>__{camping! a total stranger.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i knew that whole "waitin' to meet the right girl" thing was crap. congratulations! i have to get to physics. the truck's great.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{see ya', hottie.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{could find something to call me, other than what every guy in the world would say?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{"sweetheart?" "babe?" "aphrodite?"}
<A>__{janine sneers. at a loss, keenan grabs her and kisses her passionately. she walks off rolling her eyes, but secretly loves it. keenan climbs up into the cab.}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{so this is gonna' be like your car?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{look, i know it's dopey. but don't you recognize it? it's painted and the muffler's switched out, but this was my dad's.}
<A>__{keenan looks around with fresh eyes. he reaches an arm way up under the glove box and grins, pulling out a small stash of weed.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{ten years. a little dried out.}
<L>__{exterior country highway day}
<A>__{the truck barrels along through the trees. luke and keenan share a jointerior}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{first off, that woman. we didn't go all the way, you know?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{yeah? okay, so?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you think technically i'm still a virgin?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{were you inside her?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{it counts. nexterior ...what?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i been havin' this weird dream. the thing is, i think maybe the dream's real. forget it. no way i'm tellin' you.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{you know enough of my secrets to get me shot. sharon's mom on thanksgiving? what the fuck dream is there you can't tell me?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it's about part of me gettin' smaller. an important part.}
<A>__{keenan looks over warily, then busts out laughing, then realizes luke's serious.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{you have gotta' be fuckin' kiddin' me. you're not thirteen!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{screw you. maybe i caught something.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i think it's good you bought this truck.}
<A>__{they both laugh.}
<L>__{interior road rage garage day}
<A>__{a small, run down service garage, crammed with tires, tools and discarded car parts. luke's truck idles in the service bay, billowing smoke. max, nineteen, lean, in overalls, with shoulder length hair and edgy eyes, wipes his greasy hands on a rag. dripping with masculinity, he swaggers around the truck, chewing gum, wielding a pneumatic torque wrench, which he occasionally revs for emphasis.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i can do the gasket for twenty bucks. but new t sprocks, for this thing? two, three hundred, maybe?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{shit. can i hold off on that?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no skin off my ass. but a few days, weeks, your whole transmission could blow.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{ah, jeez. i shouldn't got this.}
<A>__{max considers, sets his baseball cap on the truck fender and}
<B>__{sighs.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{four hundred seventy five horsepower. twenty eight inch wheels. it's a classic. let me dig around out back. maybe we got a used set.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{that'd be great. thanks.}
<A>__{max disappears through a squeaky door at the back. luke picks up a rag and wipes fingerprints off the fender. he sits, impatient for max to return. he examines max's cap, tries it on. he picks up the torque wrench, swaggers about, trying to look macho, in the manner of max. he spins around and revs the wrench, catching sight of michelle, twenty, watching him from out front in jeans and t shirt, with warm, confident eyes. luke swallows, wide eyed, a deer in headlights. he sets down the torque wrench.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{it's not my wrench. it's my truck.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{what's wrong with it?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, just needs a new gasket and a couple t sprocks. the flanges are sheared off. no big deal.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{you have to watch my brother, max. he's sellin' you "t sprocks?"}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{there's no such thing. last week he sold mrs. gustafson a whole set: six hundred bucks. my name's michelle.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{from new york. poli sci transfer. i sort of asked around campus.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you've prob'ly already got a stalker, huh?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{luke stares, awkward.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you heard about cafe lunizia? italian? they got new york style pizza. make you feel at home.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{you askin' me out?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, well, uh, definitely!}
<A>__{an suv pulls up at the gas pump, stuffed with keenan and other guys. chad, exuding supreme self confidence, calls over to luke as he pumps gas.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{hey, spanky, let's go! look forward to kickin' your puck ass.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{my ride.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{your name's "spanky?"}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no, puck ass, but people just call me luke. we're beatin' his frat boy team in street hockey. pisses 'em off.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{i will talk to max. tell him to just replace the gasket.}
<A>__{luke's breathing grows heavier.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{thanks. so, what do you think? i will just sit there while you eat. i won't even talk.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{look, i just split up with this total amoeba.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, i'm a paramecium. that's way more evolved. i'm practically pond scum.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{maybe i will give you a call when the truck's ready.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{great. you mean to go out, right?}
<A>__{michelle smiles, and walks out through the squeaky door at the back. keenan approaches.}
<C>__{keenan}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{whoa. that was her! jesus, you're sweatin' like crazy.}
<A>__{luke sits, nods 'yes,' wipes beads of sweat from his brow.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{we're goin' out.}
<A>__{keenan gives him a high five. luke smiles, catching his breath.}
<L>__{interior luke & keenan's place}
<A>__{a small, run down house. hockey gear, dirty laundry and keenan are strewn across the garage sale sofa. he munches a burrito while watching the game.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{keenan! come here, quick!!!}
<A>__{keenan leaps up.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{he races down the hall, sliding on the linoleum.}
<B>__{bathroom}
<A>__{luke, a towel around his waist, stares at himself in the mirror, horrified.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{look! my chest!}
<A>__{keenan looks, clueless, a little uncomfortable now.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i had hair. come on! not a lot, but you've seen me some right?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{okay, i don't know. so?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, where'd it go?}
<A>__{keenan takes a bite of the burrito in his hand, now mashed.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i really thought you gettin' laid was gonna' help. what is it with you, man? i mean, you're smarter than me, you're better lookin' than me.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i am not.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i know. but i'm just sayin', you can get any girl you want.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{easy for you, you've got janine.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i'm still workin' on my ged. how long you think brainiac's gonna' wanna' hang with that?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{she worships you.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{man, i'm gonna' be that wild fling she had with the local dude from the bike shop. "god, what was his name?"}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you're crazy.}
<A>__{keenan gives him a look of "i'm crazy?"}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{you're gonna' have a great time with her tonight. just be yourself. ...mostly.}
<L>__{exterior cafe lunizia night}
<A>__{cheap elegance. luke and michelle dine on the patio, strung with far too many white lights.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{i caught him with my best friend. former. such a cliche'.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{winthrop hawkins. "hawk." from this park avenue family. he'd know what kind of mushrooms those are, what the best wine is.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{the best wine is beer.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{i'm such a moron.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you're not.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{no, i am. i have incontrovertible proof.}
<A>__{she kicks off her shoe and sticks her bare foot on the table, a tattoo of a green bird on her ankle.}
<C>__{michelle }
<D>__{it's a hawk. get it? "hawkins?" see, you're smirking!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i'm not.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{and it's green! that's the one color tattoo they can't remove!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh. bummer.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{i'm considering a prosthetic foot.}
<A>__{she smiles. they sip from their glasses and drink each other in. luke contemplates a kiss,... but his breathing grows shallow, he gasps.}
<C>__{michelle }
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{nothin'. maybe just kind a' hot out here. you want moron? when my dad died, it's okay, i was nine. i barely knew what was goin' on but i thought the tombstone was really sad looking, so i painted smiley faces and fish all over it.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{that's sweet.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah, i'm sure dad would've loved that.}
<A>__{his face reddens. overheated, luke tugs at his shirt, brushes sweat from his brow.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{so, what do you think makes a good relationship?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{for real? i don't know. friendship. great sex. knowing you want to be there even when it gets scary or bloody.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{whoa. where'd that come from?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{no, it's just not the usual guy thing. ...you're great, you know?}
<A>__{luke puts his hand on his chest, feels something. he stands, puts on his jacket.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{will you excuse me a sec'?}
<B>__{near the kitchen}
<A>__{hyper ventilating, his arms clutching his chest, beads of sweat on his forehead, luke checks the men's room door: locked. he ducks out the service entrance.}
<L>__{exterior parking lot}
<A>__{by the dumpster, luke reaches behind his head, whips off his jacket and shirt, and looks down... his eyes go wide.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{ aah!}
<A>__{on his chest: female breasts. two waiters come outside for a smoke.}
<C>__{first waiter}
<D>__{table twenty nine. like to bring her the cannoli special.}
<A>__{luke peers over the dumpster, down at his breasts, with a high fever, and passes out, slumping to the ground. behind the dumpster late night luke's eyes open, dilated, disoriented. he's lying on the ground, shirtless among bits of garbage. he watches bleary eyed, as a mouse peers at him from inside an empty milk carton. the mouse runs over and sniffs at a canteloupe, which triggers luke's memory: he grabs his chest, relieved to find it's back to normal. he stands, dizzy, surveying the dark, locked restaurant, and staggers across the deserted parking lot toward his truck.}
<L>__{exterior wooded highway late night}
<A>__{luke's semi thunders along.}
<B>__{inside the cab}
<A>__{luke stares out in shock. he hears heavy breathing, moans, voices.}
<C>__{female voice }
<D>__{oh yes! don't stop!}
<A>__{he looks around for the source of the sounds, glances over.}
<B>__{right side view mirror}
<A>__{in it's reflection a leering male, stripped to the waist.}
<C>__{male voice }
<D>__{lie down for me, baby!}
<A>__{the head lamps of an oncoming car flash at him. as he glances out the driver side window, music blares from the passing car.}
<B>__{inside the car}
<A>__{a glimpse of what might be an orgy of bodies intertwined. the female driver grins maniacally up at luke as the car horn screams by. luke careens to one side, glancing at the truck's}
<B>__{left side view mirror}
<A>__{the car recedes in the distance, but the female driver appears close in the mirror's reflection, leering. she licks the mirror from the inside, and disappears.}
<B>__{through the truck windshield}
<A>__{luke stares out, eyes glazed.}
<L>__{interior keenan and luke's garage}
<A>__{the decrepit old garage looks as if it may collapse any second. barbells on the floor. luke dodges and weaves, slugging a makeshift punching bag. keenan appears, wiping sleep from his eyes.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{we takin' up boxing?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i don't know. i am.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{what's goin' on? you competin' for mr. universe this week?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{everyone should just mind their own fucking business!}
<A>__{keenan recoils at the attitude.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{didn't go so great, huh?}
<A>__{luke punches the bag, harder and faster, a near seizure: road}
<B>__{rage.}
<A>__{he collapses in a heap.}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{dude.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it was goin' great. she's amazing. funny. and really smart. and the way she eats ravioli, like 'aah.'}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{then i started feelin' all weird again, and,... oh, man, you'll think i'm nuts... keen, i had breasts. i felt 'em.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{whoa, first date. definitely the 'new luke!'}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no! on me.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{you're startin' to creep me out. listen, i think i know what's goin' on, okay? "acute adolescent anxiety." it's from the stress of college, girls, grades. it's really common.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i'm not an adolescent. where'd you get this crap?!}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{the net. i found all the symptoms right off: panic attacks, "localized alopecia" that's hair loss. this doctor wrote back, "any chance your friend, luke, just lost his virginity?"}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you told, you gave him my name?!}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{he's a doctor, back east. he's sending this information pack. look, i started thinkin' you're goin' bipolar on me or somethin'. come on, man, breasts?!}
<A>__{luke considers.}
<L>__{exterior suburban house morning}
<A>__{luke hops down from the truck cab, fixes his shirt and hair, trying to look nonchalant as he rings the doorbell. hearing something behind him, he turns as max punches him in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you son of a bitch, stay the hell away from my sister!}
<A>__{luke gasps for air.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{you don't say a word?! you just leave her sittin' there?!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i came to apologize.}
<A>__{max shoves him across the yard.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{get out a' here! she's not home, anyway.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{will you tell her i came by?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no. she's honest with you, so you bolt? and then what, you wake up feelin' sorry for her?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no! is that what she thinks? i left 'cause a' what she said? that's crazy! she's like the most incredible girl i ever met!}
<A>__{max sneers, skeptical.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{i had this 'pasta quattro funghi' four mushroom. it took me a while to even figure it out, but i think someone put shrooms in it, or somehow they got in there by mistake. i was hallucinating and everything.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{amazes even me, a guy's capacity to be a world class asshole. fortunately, i'm familiar with the cause.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{will you please just tell her i came by? forget it. i will catch up with her on my own.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no. you won't.}

<C>__{max}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i mean, is it a pitbull, or what?}
<A>__{caught off guard, a smile escapes max.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{i'm crazy about her.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{shrooms, huh?}
<A>__{luke nods 'yes.'}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{i will tell her you came by.}
<A>__{luke nods, appreciative.}
<L>__{exterior muddy waters' mini mart night}
<A>__{a tanker truck quakes past. surrounded by fir trees, the eerily empty mini mart glows with fluorescent junk food. inside mini mart luke stands behind the cash register, leafing through "the outdoors man." the chime bings and sydney enters, early thirties, elegant in thrift store chic. she's cool and in control, ...at least on the outside. she surveys random candy bars, stealing glances at luke.}
<C>__{sydney}

<D>__{yeah, four am. it sucks.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{sometimes you guys are just unfathomably stupid.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{why in the world do guys say "it sucks" as if it were a bad thing? i mean, every guy's dying to get a blow job, right? so, you think they'd treat those words with profound respect, like holy scripture. "what an unbelievable sunset, honey: doesn't it just suck?,"... "you won an olympic gold medal?!, that blows!"}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i guess you're right.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{it must be great at your age. that river of testosterone coursing through your veins, the damn about to burst! how about we just lock this place up and go for an olympic gold?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no thanks. jeez, lady.}
<A>__{disappointed, she checks her reflection in the freezer door.}
<C>__{sydney}

<D>__{uh, i don't know. looks fine.}

<D>__{your hair is such an incredible color.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it's brown.}
<C>__{sydney}

<C>__{luke}
<D>__{nah, c'mon. you're messin' with me.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i'm not. i love it. you really should get rid a' that thing, anyway. i have clippers in my bag.}

<D>__{what thing?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{cowlick. right here. see? i can just snip it off.}

<D>__{what's the matter? don't you like being touched? don't you like being a guy?}

<D>__{no. i mean,... what? sorry, but you're just bizarre.}
<A>__{she chuckles, lays money on the counter.}
<C>__{sydney}

<C>__{janine}
<D>__{actually, i tried exactly what you said.}

<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{wild past, huh?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i think the only reason he's even alive right now, is okay, partly 'cause he's so damn smart, but mostly 'cause there's this one person, he knows, absolutely, no matter what, won't bale on him.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{you.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{no. he doesn't trust me at all. luke. he's a rock.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{so, yes, you can trust him. i'm hoping keenan's the same way. 'cause believe me, i'm not used to rocks, i'm used to pebbles.}

<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{grains of sand.}

<C>__{luke}
<D>__{super glue. thirty seconds together, you can't pull 'em apart.}

<C>__{luke }
<D>__{i never thought in a million years you'd go out with me, let alone twice.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{you're not s'posed to say that. that's a total pathetic, loser thing to say. but i'm gonna' take it as a huge compliment.}
<C>__{michelle }
<D>__{okay, two word answers only. why'd you ask me out in the first place?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{beautiful. unpretentious. why'd you say 'yes?'}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{gentle.}
<A>__{luke sneers, not his favorite compliment.}

<D>__{okay, i'm gonna' take a wild shot. ricochet off the back, over here, then straight into that side pocket. what are my chances?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{point zero zero zero one.}
<A>__{luke takes his shot,... and kisses her. the ball ricochets off the back, across the table, and sinks in the pocket at the side.}

<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{damn. will you look at that tonsil hockey?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i'd prefer not. this could get bad.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{you've been staring at him all night. you got a thing for him, or what?}

<C>__{michelle }
<D>__{okay, i'm gonna' break this wide open!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{go for it!}
<A>__{before keenan has lifted the wooden triangle rack, michelle hammers the cue ball. it cracks off the rack, rockets off the table,... and cannonballs luke in the crotch. keenan, michelle, and janine all gasp. they cringe, poised, waiting for luke to react.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{god. sorry.}
<A>__{luke picks the cue ball up off the floor and sets it on the table. he sees them watching him.}
<C>__{luke}

<D>__{man, i'd be on the floor cryin' like a baby.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no, i'm all right.}
<A>__{surprised, they return to the game. michelle lines up the cue ball again, as luke considers,... with a slow dawning realization that something, somehow, just isn't right. he casually touches his hand to his pants. he pales slightly.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{would you excuse me a sec'?}

<D>__{i will get some ice.}

<D>__{no! we're gonna' get it back!}
<P>__{(to keenan)}
<D>__{you let me help him, he gets a normal body, lives a normal life. now, you his friend or not?!}

<D>__{finally.}
<A>__{sydney helps luke flop down on the floor. he passes out.}
<C>__{sydney }
<D>__{he'll be alright. he didn't go all the way. when you fall asleep or pass out, a z almost always reverts back. it's called a nocturnal remission.}
<A>__{keenan approaches luke, then steps back.}
<C>__{sydney }
<D>__{oh, relax, it's not contagious.}

<D>__{man, this could be a problem.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{is there a cure?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{it's not a disease! but there are steps you can take.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, what are they?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{take it easy. you can't rush this. before anything, you need to try going all the way.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{"all the way?"}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you need to turn all the way into a female.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you out of your mind?!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you have to give it a try.}

<D>__{maybe we should get a second opinion.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah, may be! 'cause you can forget that!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{fine, but i warn you, they've never seen this before. first, they'll try a barrage of antipsychotic medications, surgery, electroshock therapy, god knows what.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{if he were to try goin' all the way, then what?}
<A>__{luke glares at him.}
<C>__{keenan }

<D>__{i'm okay. you?}

<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{thanks. i was hopin' you might call.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i was going to.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{there's something i need to talk to you about. but did i do something wrong?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no. nothin' like that. there's just some stuff i've got to sort out.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{like what?}
<A>__{they gaze at each other across the magazine rack, a mountain range of silence between them,...}
<C>__{michelle }
<D>__{there's nothing you can't tell me.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{me too. what did you want to talk to me about?}

<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{nothing really. so, heard you and max really got into it?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah. i kind a' lost it.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{he knows how to push buttons, huh? what exactly did he say that got you so pissed off?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i don't know. we'd just finished a game. i was all revved up.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{he's actually a really nice guy.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{not sure he's too crazy about me seein' his sister.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{did he scare you off?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no, he doesn't "scare" me. what, his struttin' around, thinkin' he's such a bad ass, with his shirt hangin' open half the time?}
<A>__{luke's surprised and embarrassed by his own words. michelle steps away, confused.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{it's just an act. he likes pretending he's joe cool. always says you gotta' just be whatever you want, and fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, he's a joke alright.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{look, i'm not sure this is gonna' work out.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i didn't mean }
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{no. i can't do this. i'm not sure you even know who you are. much less who i am. have you ever even had a girlfriend?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?!}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{well, if you think my brother's such a "joke," how much better could you think of me? we're not that different, you know?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you're totally different. he's a guy, for one.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{and he's my best friend. if you don't like him, you can't like me.}
<A>__{she exits. mini mart later luke kneels in the aisle, stocking shelves, distracted, fidgety, distressed. he glances up at the magazine rack. a female fitness magazine catches his attention. the beautiful cover model seems to move. he stares at it: no movement. luke approaches the rack, and flips over the magazine cover. as he steps away, he glances back at the rack,}
<B>__{celebrity magazine cover}
<A>__{the adonis on the cover comes to life. he rips off his shirt as he moves off one magazine cover and into another, where he passionately kisses the bikini clad cover model.}

<A>__{washing herself, behind the shower curtain, the timbre of her singing voice mysteriously shifts. as her hand turns the shower faucet, it changes...}

<A>__{a glimpse of her shoulder behind the shower curtain, grows more muscular, and her voice begins lowering in pitch,... as michelle becomes max.}

<B>__{by the fireplace}
<A>__{sydney pours hot tea.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you're one too. why didn't you tell me?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i didn't want to confuse the issue.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{so, it's true what you said? you really know. i wouldn't change unless i wanted to?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{maybe some part of you.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what part? how much of me? i mean, for it to work? half? more than half? what if it was only a tiny bit, a thought?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i don't know. but i believe there may be thousands of z's out there, millions for all we know, go their whole lives without even knowing they are one. nothing ever happens. you couldn't keep it from happening.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i love being with michelle. how come i can't control it when she's around?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i think whatever part of yourself you deny, just gets bigger and bigger until it takes you over.}
<A>__{luke nods sadly.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you think i don't really want to be a man.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i think for some, making it stop is more important than knowing who you are. it was for me.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{maybe for me too.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{right now, you're morphescent. the key is to have sex with another z. you become adulmorphic. your gender locks. you can't just change anytime you want.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{another z?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{that's why i came all the way out here.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{and why you keep tryin' to get me in the sack?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{thought maybe i could save you some distress. but you say you're not attracted to me. for it to work, both of us have to be into it.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{that won't be a problem.}

<A>__{he stares up at the sky.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{and that burning shingle drifted over and lit up the robertson's place? the whole town was ready to lynch us, and we snuck back home... two am, you were up drinkin' coffee,...}
<A>__{he tugs out hunks of grass.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{i thought you were gonna' kill us. but you just looked me right in the eye, and said, "son, there's leftover pizza in the fridge."}
<A>__{a tear rims his eye.}

<D>__{that was the coolest thing anyone ever said. dad, i'm in such trouble.}
<C>__{luke }

<D>__{yeah? what the hell.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{luca demonstrates hockey technique, expertly guiding a hockey puck through an obstacle course of broken equipment, timber, and sawdust piles. all the while, she dodges max's attempts to steal the puck. max finally gets it, which riles luca. she hip checks max. they swerve to avoid a pipe, crash landing on top of each other on a sawdust pile. they bust out laughing.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{not bad.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you're better than luke.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i taught him everything he knows.}
<A>__{luca pulls away from max, suddenly self conscious that max's leg is on top of hers. awkward from the broken connection, they gaze up at the blue sky through a hole in the roof.}

<D>__{had to come back.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{good.}

<D>__{have you been?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{little italy. in new york. someday, though. want to go with me?}
<A>__{max leans over and kisses luca. she responds, tentatively at first, then as she grows more confident,... her face reddens, she gasps. luca pulls back, self conscious, confused. she brushes sawdust off her dress, stands.}

<D>__{look, this was a mistake.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{yeah. of course. i know.}
<A>__{looking up, luca sees keenan, staring at them from across the floor, incredulous. keenan exits out through the giant doors.}

<D>__{huh?}

<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i had to be sure. i am now. come on, it's sort of a catch 22. i make out with a girl, i start turning into one. you gotta' admit, it's a little weird, isn't it?}

<D>__{'cause you're straight as a girl, and i'm gay as a guy, even if we do it...}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i'm just screwed.}
<A>__{keenan's confused...}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{jeez. you need trigonometry to figure this thing out. maybe you're 'bi.'}
<C>__{male sydney}
<D>__{in my world the kinsey scale's three dimensional, but trust me, girls do nothing for me. zilch!}

<D>__{oh, man.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{it's not what you think.}

<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{what does she think?}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i'm not sure.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{you asshole!}

<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{i don't believe this. you slept with that guy?!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{it's not what you think.}

<D>__{oh, please! what about max?}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{what about him?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{don't you care about him at all?!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{not like that: i'm straight! i'm attracted to you!}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{oh, who cares, you idiot! and sorry to break it to you, but i'm straight too.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{no. this'll sound crazy, but i'm not who you think i am }

<D>__{oh, christ, luke, luca: i know who you are!}
<A>__{luca stares, stunned.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{you know i'm a zerophiliac?!}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{yes! so you can just go fuck yourself. literally!}
<C>__{luca}

<D>__{is that what you think?! no!}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{well, then congratulations! you're a guy, just like every other guy i ever met! i can't believe you slept with him!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{he was a woman! i was tricked. i didn't know i'd switch.}

<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{well, that's just perfect. what, is there something in the water around here?!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{she told me it would make it stop. that it would keep me from turning into a girl.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{so what?! why's that so important to you?! there's no way this was gonna' work.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{because i'm a zerophiliac.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{because you can't stand being one! bye, luca.}
<C>__{luca}
<P>__{(correcting her)}
<D>__{luke.}
<A>__{she glances back, sad and angry. luca watches her go, distraught, and then runs...}
<B>__{atop a grassy hillside}
<A>__{luca collapses on the ground, overlooking polly wog's. janine and keenan run up, a few yards behind. they sit nearby, catching their breath, unsure what to say. luca gazes up at the moon.}
<C>__{luca }
<D>__{what's it like? to really make love?}
<A>__{they all three gaze up at the moon. keenan steals a glance at janine.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{the best part's just lyin' there after. really close, really far away.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{like goin' to the moon, maybe.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{yeah. ...they should open a pizza joint up there.}
<A>__{janine glares at him, and keenan winces.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{what am i gonna' do?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{maybe being a woman'll turn out okay. like being an elevated member of the male species.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{elevated "member?"}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i just mean, maybe he'll learn to like it.}
<C>__{janine}
<P>__{(sarcastic, to keenan)}
<D>__{as hard as that is to conceive!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{shut up! both of you! what, you want a written guarantee? you're so damn lucky! you're into him, he's into you. super glue! what the hell else do you need to know?}
<A>__{janine looks to keenan with a look of remorse, hopeful...}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i think you're the female half of me.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i think you're the macho half of me.}
<A>__{they kiss.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{and i don't know what half of who the hell i am.}
<A>__{they look to luca surprised,... then all three bust out laughing.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{what are you gonna' do?}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i don't know. i prefer being a guy, but i'm a girl? i'm attracted to max, but i'm in love with michelle? it's like i'm s'posed to be both.}
<A>__{her own admission surprises her.}
<C>__{luca }
<D>__{not too practical. but at least now i know.}
<A>__{she almost laughs, sad, but relieved.}
<L>__{interior polly wog's pool hall late night}
<A>__{the place is cleared out, save for polly cleaning up behind the bar and max, alone, shooting pool.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{girl trouble? boy trouble?}
<A>__{max shrugs.}
<C>__{polly }
<D>__{how about we get a game in before dawn?}
<A>__{max nods, sets up a new rack.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what's the point? it never works out. or they just cheat on you anyway.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{liverpool was a veritable shagfest when i was your age. a boulevard of broken hearts. but eventually, i found him.}
<A>__{she sinks the cue ball in a corner pocket.}
<C>__{polly }
<D>__{scratch. then he died.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{everything reminded me of him. so, i came here, half way round the world to forget. then created this place, just like the one where we met.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{he can't handle this. us. he can't handle who he is.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{you being a guy too?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{or him being a girl.}
<A>__{polly's confused, but presses on.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{everyone's terrified. but once you really know someone, and they know you, it makes you whole.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no one wants to know who i really am.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{you're so sure?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's impossible. he was the one person i thought could understand. but no, it's impossible.}
<A>__{max puts the cue stick down, and moves off. polly calls after,...}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{it's worth finding out.}
<L>__{exterior road rage garage late afternoon}
<A>__{max slides out from under an old car. seeing luca, he hardens, wiping his greasy hands on a rag.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i know she doesn't want to talk to me. but do you know where i can find her?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{new york. left two days ago.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{oh, man. ...you're staying?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{just 'til friday.}
<A>__{max returns to his work.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i wanted to apologize to her. forget it, i don't know,... obviously, nothing's gonna' ever be with me and her, but i just wish she knew how much i, and that i wasn't cheating, i was just trying to be a man for her.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{she'd have a field day with that one, huh?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{true.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{if you talk to her, please just tell her, i'm sorry, and i wish her the best,... everything.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{luca 'nods', not fully understanding max's response.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i'm sorry. to you too.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{mixed signals, i guess.}
<A>__{max walks toward the back, then yelps, wincing.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{ow! son of a bitch!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{you all right?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{stepped on a nail. damn it!}
<A>__{max sits on a crate, starts untying his boot.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{so, you gettin' used to this at all?}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i wish.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you definitely had me confused.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{for whatever it's worth. i think you're a pretty hot guy.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{thanks. but you're not interested?}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{truth is, i am. and i guess it sounds crazy, but i couldn't do that to michelle.}
<A>__{luca moves off, as max removes his boot, and his sock.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{for whatever it's worth, i think you're pretty hot too.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{too bad you're a moron.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i have incontrovertible proof.}
<A>__{luca stares at max, and then down at his ankle, at the tattoo}
<B>__{of a green bird.}
<A>__{max meets her eyes, and it finally dawns on luca, standing, in shock, and now putting it all together, she lunges for him, nailing him to the ground, kissing him. she rips max's t shirt as they fall to the asphalt, knocking over oil cans. passion. unbridled.}
<B>__{in the parts yard}
<A>__{luca manhandles max, shoving him against a pile of huge tires, as max's face transforms...}
<B>__{by old radiators}
<A>__{michelle slams back onto the crabgrass. she pulls luca toward her as luca's face transforms into luke.}
<B>__{by discarded truck chassis}
<A>__{luke and michelle roll on the crabgrass, kissing, transforming as they roll, into luca and max and michelle and luke and luca or was that max?}
<L>__{interior michelle's bedroom dawn}
<A>__{white gauze curtains billow in the morning breeze. the sun's first rays light up the down comforter and white pillows. michelle stirs slowly, then bolts awake. she grabs luke, a vise grip around his torso. he awakens, groggy.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hey you. ...good morning. what's up?}
<A>__{michelle bites her lip, embarrassed, releases him.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{you still think i'm going to bolt, don't you?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{and leave me stuck.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what do you want, a gender pre nup?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{maybe. i have to go to work.}
<A>__{she nuzzles him playfully. luke glances at the clock, moans.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{only place i'm going is back to sleep.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{no. i can't show up at work like this.}
<C>__{luke}
