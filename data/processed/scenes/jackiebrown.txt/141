<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{a young woman a.t.f surveillance agent}
<A>__{pretends to shop. she watches louis grab melanie.}
<C>__{nicolet }
<D>__{we had our agent on you. she sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a robinson's may bag and tussle with a tough looking white guy. the white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.}
<B>__{back to office}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{this guy with melanie, that was louis gara?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i didn't see him. i was in my underwear. if it was a white guy, it was probably louis. he kill melanie?}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{it's possible. you're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{you'd take a polygraph on it?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{if it'll make you happy.}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{i sure hope you haven't done anything dumb jackie.}
<A>__{dargus comes to the doorway...}
<C>__{dargus}
<P>__{(to nicolet)}
<D>__{can i have a word with you?}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{they both leave, leaving jackie all by herself in the room, smoking. they both come back in. nicolet continues, dargus takes a seat in the corner saying nothing.}
<C>__{nicolet }
<D>__{louis gara's dead. l.a.p.d. found him dead in a car on ninth. and we've lost ordell.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i thought you were watching him.}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{we were, and we lost him. he walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. the bar was on ninth, less than a mile and a half from where louis was found dead. it looks like louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{so what happens now?}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{we pick up ordell. we've got three murders we can link him to. we have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. and we have you.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what about me?}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{what about you?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{do you think i took some of that money?}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{i have no evidence of your taking anything. you didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; i was glad to see that. you've been helping us out, you gave us melanie and louis. melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.}
<A>__{jackie listens.}
<C>__{nicolet }
<D>__{i will settle for ordell with the marked bills.}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{if you have something else going on you haven't told me about, it's between you and ordell. all i gotta say is, you better hope we find him before he finds you.}
