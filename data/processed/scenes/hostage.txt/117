<A>__{kevin joins him at the bar. mars is by the doors }
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{he said that?}
<A>__{dennis downs a big hit of vodka, then moves to the couch }
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{if we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash. that's how we'll stay alive.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{the only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it. he's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights. he's probably planning it right now.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{that's crazy. he's not going to kill us.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...}
<A>__{kevin follows his brother to the couch and stares at him; dennis has clearly lost his mind, and kevin has reached the end of his rope }
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{it's over. we have to give up.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{fuck it's over. that money's mine.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{that money's fucked up your brain. talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!}
<A>__{dennis tips his glass, like a toast }
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{then we might as well die rich.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i'm not going to die for this!}
<A>__{kevin slaps the glass away. dennis boils up from the couch. he grabs his brother and the two of them fall over the coffee table, dennis hammering kevin in a furious rage until he runs out of gas }
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{you're my fuckin' anchor, kevin, the fuckin' lead around my life that i've been draggin' like a cripple leg!}
<A>__{dennis gets up and steps back }
<C>__{dennis }
<D>__{get this into your stupid head, kevin. we're not leaving without the money.}
<A>__{beaten and whimpering, kevin crawls away. dennis watches him crawl out of the room, then looks at mars }
<C>__{dennis }
<D>__{you got something to say?}
<C>__{mars}
<D>__{i like it here, dennis. i'm never going to leave.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{fuckin' a.}
<A>__{dennis returns to the bar. when he looks around again, mars is gone melted into the darkness.}
