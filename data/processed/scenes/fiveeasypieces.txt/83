<A>__{bobby and tita walk away from the house down toward the ocean. accompanying them is a borzoi hound belonging to her.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{he has ways of communicating, robert. i can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{uhm hmm. some range.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{it's not that bad.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yes, it is. i can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{a week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for godsakes.}
<A>__{he doesn't respond.}
<C>__{tita }
<D>__{i mean, you think i'm that happy?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no, i don't.}
<P>__{(a pause, then:)}
<D>__{you should've left a long time ago.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{we can't all get up and leave, can we? i mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...}
<A>__{she stops walking and moves to one of the garden chairs, facing out toward the bay.}
<C>__{tita }
<D>__{and anyway, i want you to stay, so i can spend some time with you, and ask you some questions...}
<A>__{he leans his back against a tree.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what questions?}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{well, do you i mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{sometimes.}
<A>__{she stares at him for a moment, and taking note of it:}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{why? am i some kind of freak to you or something?}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{no, no, i don't think that, i'm just curious about it...}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{do you think i'm a freak?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{sort of.}
<A>__{she laughs.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{oh no... why? what is it? the way i look?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no, i don't really think you're a freak.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{i probably am, but i don't care. i mean, i wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would i have had time to make any improvements...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what about carl and catherine? is he just coaching her, or what?}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{constantly. night and day. and unless i get up before the birds, i can't get in any practice time for myself...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{uhm hmm.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. she'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you're attractive, tita. if you just did a little more with yourself...}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, i want to talk about you...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{there's nothing to say, tita...}
<A>__{he offers nothing further and looks out over the bay. then, after a brief silence:}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i don't know.}
