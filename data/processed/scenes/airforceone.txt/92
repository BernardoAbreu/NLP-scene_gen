<L>__{interior corridor, air force one night}
<A>__{nevsky and bazylev guard the conference room door as korshunov and vlad enter. nevsky hands korshunov a copy of the plane's manifest.}
<C>__{nevsky}
<D>__{every weapon and every person is accounted for.}
<A>__{korshunov nods and enters the room.}
<L>__{interior conference room night}
<A>__{korshunov surveys the hostages. viad covers them at gunpointerior rose holds alice, comforting her. shepherd, doherty, aides, advisors, crew... fifty of them huddle like sardines. the plane's doctor administers to the wounded. korshunov stares down his captives.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{fear will keep you alive. any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{what do you want with us?}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{cooperation. if you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. good day.}
<A>__{korshunov exits, with viad backing out behind him. leaving the hostages alone. the sound of the door locking. a mournful beat. everyone looks at each other and the dead and wounded victims of this heinous act... hushed conversation breaks out all over the room.}
<C>__{doherty}
<D>__{this can't be happening. you just don't pull this shit with the united states. you just don't.}
<C>__{major caldwell}
<D>__{keep your heads.}
<A>__{caldwell paces, looks around the room.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{mrs. marshall, are you okay?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{we're alive.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{that's all that matters. thank god the president got of f the plane.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{yes... thank god.}
<P>__{(to caldwell)}
<D>__{you there... caidwell, right? what's on your mind? caldwell takes a beat, then crosses to rose and shepherd.}
<C>__{major caldwell}
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{i don't want to get anybody here excited, but if we can get out of this room, i can get us to safety.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{we're thirty five thousand feet up.}
<C>__{major caldwell}
<D>__{yes, sir, that's a problem, but if we can somehow get to a lower altitude, the rear loading ramp on the baggage deck is equipped with parachutes in case of an engine failure. now we can either wait for a political resolution, or try to resolve this thing ourselves.}
<C>__{doherty}
<D>__{you're goddamn right we can resolve this ourselves. we'll negotiate.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{you know the president's policy.}
<C>__{doherty}
<D>__{the president isn't here.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{right now we are an enormous liability to the united states. we can't just sit and do nothing.}
