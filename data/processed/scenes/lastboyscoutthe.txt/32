<A>__{joe hallenbeck is pounding an already dented cigarette machine. no dice. it has eaten his money. he shakes his head, muttering. looks at his watch. looks at the dressing room door. shakes his head again. walks to the end of the corridor. goes through the fire door. out into:}
<L>__{exterior parking lot continuous action}
<A>__{starry, moonlit night. a chill breeze. joe draws a breath. in front of him, on the wall of the club, is a poster: baynard for senate, it reads. above the logo, a picture of a benevolent looking gray haired man. hallenbeck regards it balefully.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i didn't vote for you, you bastard.}
<A>__{he looks away, and suddenly notices something on the ground: a half smoked cigarette butt. just sitting there. joe stares at it. thinks it over. starts to walk away. stops.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you're a fuckin' lowlife, joe.}
<A>__{he bends to pick up the butt. a steel sap whistles over his head, missing by inches. hallenbeck spins, startled. reflexively lashes out with a flattened palm. misses, chops the air. two more men, behind him. nowhere to go. a sap pops him behind the left ear. a sickening thud. the world spins out of focus. he goes down. hits the pavement like a ton of bricks. rolls over, staring up. vision muddy, indistinct. hallenbeck's pov three silhouettes hover over him, backlit by streetlamps. their voices are fuzzy.}
<D>__{hitman #1 that's him. he was with her. hitman #2 shit, he's packing. what should we do? hitman #3 get him away from here. then kill him. hitman #2 there's no contract for him. hitman #3 then do it for free. just do it elsewhere.}
<A>__{the men disperse. one of them drags joe to his feet. a stocky, crag faced man. he jams a silenced pistol in joe's kidney and points him toward a vacant lot nearby.}
<D>__{hitman #2 start walking. i'm right behind you.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the two other hitmen return to their gray, late model sedan. climb into the car and sit, watching the nightclub. waiting.}
