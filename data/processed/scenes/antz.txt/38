<L>__{exterior insectopia night}
<A>__{the insects are having a cookout, their faces illuminated by the still red ember of a match. platters heaped with food lie untouched as they pat their bellies... z and bala sit next to one another, smiling shyly as if they had just met for the first time.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{so...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, i guess.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{well, "trouble" is my middle name. actually, my middle name is .985, but i don't tell people. hey, bala, i...i actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.}
<A>__{z takes out bala's scarf, which he's been keeping folded in a pocket.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{you held onto this all that time?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{well, i...i know it's a little strange, but...i thought it might come in handy if i...needed a scarf someday.}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{well, to be honest, i just liked having it.}
<A>__{he hands it back to her. bala looks at z, frankly, openly. for a moment z is shy. then he looks at her too. they're two lovers, leaning closer, about to have their first kiss, when }
<C>__{beetle}
<D>__{hey z!}
<A>__{the moment is wrecked. z looks up. a chubby beetle stands there with gus the termite.}
<C>__{beetle}
<D>__{wanna bring back dessert? there's a thirty foot long blimp in the next can, made completely of chocolate!}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{sure. i wasn't busy or anything.}
<A>__{z gets up to go with them.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{great timing, guys. ever wonder why they call you "pests"?}
