<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{he admitted it.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{right in front of us. mueller went after him but we held him back. pike surrendered and volunteered to be tied up. so we roped him to a chair and tried to ride out the storm.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{why would he just surrender?}
<A>__{kendall turns to her and smiles.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{because he had a plan.}
<L>__{interior cabin living room last night}
<A>__{pike, tied to a chair by the fireplace while the others look for, food in the kitchen. alone, kendall walks past pike:}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{hey, kendall, talk to you for a sec?}
<A>__{kendall looks around there seems no harm in it.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{you hated west as much as i did. i'm not saying what i did was right, but you can't tell me you're not glad the motherfucker's dead.}
<A>__{kendall says nothing. pike looks around, makes sure no one is listening and then whispers:}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{the thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. you turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked }
<C>__{kenoall}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{a gay senator's son who let his sarge get fragged on a training exercise? the press'll crucify you and your father. his career will be over and it'll be your fault. but we do this different and you come out a hero.}
<A>__{on kendall, thinking about it. a beat.}
<C>__{kenoall}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{mueller. he's as bad as west and we both know it. now i can't do it, cause i'm tied up, but we get the others to go along }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{don't think i want to hear this }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. maybe nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead the guys who took out their sergeant's killers!}
<C>__{pike }
<D>__{we'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged west, all we gotta do is tell the story right.}
<A>__{kendall stares at him. disgusted.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{you're sick, pike.}
<A>__{he turns and walks away. pike watches him go.}
<C>__{kendall }
<D>__{later on i.saw him talking to dunbar. they had been close. i was in another room when it happened.}
