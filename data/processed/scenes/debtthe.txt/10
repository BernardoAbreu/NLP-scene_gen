<A>__{the apartment block stands on stilts. abandoned furniture is piled around the columns supporting the building. still on david as the two men walk out from the darkness into the street that services the run down estate. david follows as the agent moves ahead towards a larger road. they cross a busy carriageway, and wait for a moment on the central reservation for a break in the traffic. parked on the far side of the road, two identical cars, their windows tinted. the agent moves to the leading car, opens the driver's door and gets in. david stops in the road, opens the rear passenger door and throws his jacket inside. he pauses for a moment and turns to look back at the second car.}
