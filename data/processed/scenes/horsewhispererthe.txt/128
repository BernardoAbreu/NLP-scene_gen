<L>__{exterior ranch house night}
<A>__{annie wanders out, passing grace and joe on her way out. the two are sitting in a glider. as annie exits o.c., we hear them;}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{why do you always wear that hat?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{because it fits my head. you want to try it on?}
<A>__{grace doesn't know if she should. annie continues towards tom who's sitting in a rocker playing with the twins.}
<C>__{twins}
<D>__{show us again! come on! one more time! it's my turn now!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{all right, al right. hold out your finger.}
<A>__{annie takes a seat nearby and watches as tom holds out the first finger of his right hand. the twins holds out his. tom splits his focus between annie and the twins as he takes a small piece of rope out of his back pocket. he ties the ends together making a loop. he puts the loop over the twin's finger. and holding the other end of the loop taut with his left hand, he draws one side of the cord over the other with the middle finger of his right hand. then he rolls his hand over so it's under the loop, and back over it again, so that his finger is tip to tip with the twin's. the loop seemingly knotted around their touching fingertips, and can only be removed if their touch is broken.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{the loop's knotted, right.}
<P>__{(twins nod)}
<D>__{looks like the only way to take it off, is if we break our touch...}
<P>__{(they nod)}
<D>__{watch now...}
<A>__{annie and the twins look down at the touching fingers as tom gently pulls the rope away, revealing they are still knotted, and without even breaking their touch...}
<C>__{twins}
<D>__{again! again. one more time!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{oh, no. no, no. i only fall for that once. go inside now before your mother starts hunting you down. go on.}
<A>__{the twins exit. annie and tom make eye contact.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(smiles, relaxes back)}
<D>__{so how was your first and last day of branding?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{don't be so sure it's my last. there are a few people back home i'd like to put under a red hot iron.}
<A>__{tom looks at her with a sly expression, and notices she's shivering.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you got too much sun today... here...}
<A>__{he takes his jacket and puts it around her shoulders.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he sits back down. annie crosses her arms over her chest, looks around, unconsciously swinging her foot. tom watches her leg. annie notices him watching;}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you ever just stand still for a minute?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you stand still too long in new york you get hit by a bicycle messenger.}
<P>__{(smiles wryly)}
<D>__{you know, sometimes, i get the feeling, mr. booker, that you're laughing at me. why is that?}
<A>__{tom shrugs. annie waits a beat, then:}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{that's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{oh, i see, you write both sides of the conversation?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it's a man's world, mr. booker. most women have to.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well, maybe i am laughing a bit... i just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(understanding)}
<D>__{well... it's beautiful country, i will give you that. and i could see having some kind of vacation place. retreat. but i don't know how you do it full time. don't you miss the rest of the world?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what's that to miss?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something i can't explain.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(thinks, teasing a bit)}
<D>__{does chicago count?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{you lived in chicago?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{when i was first married.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{you were married to a woman in chicago?}
<A>__{tom likes disturbing her picture of him as the predictable cowboy. he smiles;}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i once heard itzhak perlman guest star with the chicago symphony orchestra. he played rachmaninov's vocalize opus 34. no. 14. it was one of the most beautiful pieces of music i ever heard. i actually forgot where i was for a time.}
<P>__{(annie is floored)}
<D>__{you seem surprised?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(not wanting to insult)}
<D>__{well, i, uh... you didn't...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{just who's been laughing at who here?}
<A>__{tom says this with a wry smile. annie returns with a smile as an understanding is reached between them: they've both stereotyped the other. they are both pleased and attracted by what they don't know.}
