<L>__{exterior ocean day the raft}
<A>__{sean is crying on his isolated perch, clinging to the upturned keel. the other kids are throwing a rope, trying to get him back. patrick heaves, and misses.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{sean! catch the rope!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{the rope! the rope!}
<A>__{the others shoot fearful glances at the waters.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{he's got to help or it won't work.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{sean, baby, please...}
<A>__{sean is ignoring the efforts to rescue him, paralyzed by fear, he shivers alone. jackie is near catatonia herself, brooke and doug trying to soothe her.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it killed her. it ate her.}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{shh. shhh...}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{it's okay, it's okay...}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{sean! listen! listen to me, sean.}
<A>__{the kid looks up dully.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{goddamn it, sean, you listen to me or i will kick your ass, do you hear me?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{listen to andy, sean.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{we're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?}
<A>__{sean nods. the other kids are encouraged. the rope is thrown it misses.}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(to bob)}
<D>__{keep an eye out for that fish.}
<A>__{bob climbs to a vantage point, watching.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{throw it.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{sean! catch it!}
<A>__{another miss. in his haste to help, larry overreaches to fish the trailing rope out of the water, and falls headlong into the sea. shrieks of fright from the others.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{larry!}
<A>__{he scrambles out, hardly wet, that's how fast he's moving. finally patrick takes the crucial throw, and the rope practically knocks sean off his perch, but he clutches and holds it. as andy carefully calls instructions, sean secures the rope and the others carefully, carefully begin to pull him in. angle on sean as they pull. the slippery rope is undoing itself.}
<B>__{the raft}
<A>__{with the kids reaching out hands, sticks, rope, anything to pull the little one to safety. the ocean swells rise and fall with hidden menace.}
<B>__{quick cuts}
<A>__{ hands gripping rope. the knot, pulling apart. anguished faces, concentrating, as patrick, lucy, larry, and andy struggle to bring him in.}
<B>__{andy and sean}
<A>__{success. he's pulled to safety. they lash his little hull as tight as they can to the rest of the floating wreckage. bob sees something.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{cable junction's ahead!}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{can we make it?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{bob's point of view looking over the wreckage to cable junction, now much closer. beyond it, miles of empty atlantic. it's off to one side, and unless they can slow down or alter course, they will miss it.}
<B>__{the raft}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(to jackie)}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{she's not. shaking, silent, eyes glazed.}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(alone)}
<D>__{dear jesus, holy mary, mother of god, help us, please...}
<P>__{(her lips move inaudibly)}
<C>__{brooke}
<P>__{(to doug)}
<D>__{keep her warm.}
<P>__{(to jackie)}
<D>__{jackie? baby?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{can someone help me rig a jury rudder? we might steer this...}
<A>__{andy joins him, and they try to make a sweep or a rudder out of whatever wreckage they can use.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{by 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out. more, with this wind.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i can't stop thinking!}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(praying aloud)}
<D>__{god, please help us, merciful father, in christ's name, we beg you, help us, please, dear god, save us, help us, please, god, help...}
