<T>__{transition:}
<L>__{exterior street across from torchie's night}
<A>__{they two men walk toward the cadillac.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{okay, reggie, i'm done playing around. i want to know what's going on and i'm going to beat the living shit out of you until you tell me.}
<A>__{hammond goes into a street rap.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you beat the shit out of me? don't make me laugh, sucker. you don't know how i'd dance on your face? i will hit you so hard, so many times, you'll wish you'd never been hatched. i will turn your face into cottage cheese. i will make your girl think you been takin' ugly pills. she won't even know who you are, sucker.}
<A>__{they stop by the car. cates takes the gun out, lays it on the hood. hammond stares at him. cates next takes out his wallet, shows hammond his badge, then lays the badge on the car fender... smiles.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i guess the first thing i ought, to explain to you, nigger, is i fight dirty.}
<A>__{hits hammond a tremendous right hand full in the face. hammond sags, grabs onto the car fender for support. cates hesitates ... and hammond kicks out, sending the partially open car door slamming into cates. cates sprawls.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{so do i.}
<A>__{hammond aims a kick at cates' head. cates blocks it with crossed forearms, grabs, twists. hammond tumbles, rolls away from cates. both men struggle to their feet, circle each other. hammond moves in only to receive twoquick blows from cates, a bit sooner than he expected. cates smiles. hammond dances in and out... cates' breathing becomes more labored. his windmill attack penetrates cates' defense. cates clears his head, charges, bull like ... his rush and greater bulk send both of them crashing into some trash cans and a brick wall. hammond is faster... cates is much stronger; both men on their knees. they look at one another. silently, they move to their feet. hammond's back is to a wall... cates keeps him there, negates the lighter man's agility. they slug away, each now arm weary... exchange a dozen blows. finally, cates steps back, arms at his side... breath coming like a bellows... hammond has to hold on to the wall; one more punch would put him out.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{now, you bastard, you going to tell me what's going on...}
<A>__{puffing away.}
<C>__{cates}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{... do i have to kick the shit out of you some more.}
<A>__{they stand facing one another. hammond smiles. a black and white comes roaring up the street. sirens howling, red lights flashing, it slides to a stop. two uniformed cops jump out, guns drawn.}
<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{all right, you two. don't move.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{no, no...it's okay...i'm police.}
<C>__{second cop}
<D>__{yeah, sure. get your hands above your head.}
<A>__{he keeps his gun trained on cates,and hammond.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{my gun and badge are over there. and i'm too fucking tired to raise my hands...}
<A>__{hammond rubs the side of his face. cates falls back against the patrol car. still fighting for breath. the first cop lifts cates' wallet off the cadillac and looks at his badge, shows it to the other cop.}
<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{what the hell's going on here?}
<A>__{cates walks over, pockets his gun.}
<C>__{second cop}
<D>__{i've got a burglary call. two women say a couple of hoods broke into their place posing as cops.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i was following a lead. we rousted them... go up and sweet talk 'em. you can straighten it out.}
<A>__{the first cop checks out cates' badge and i.d.}
<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{why don't you do it? we got better things to do than straighten out your messes.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{so do i. i will file a report tomorrow.}
<A>__{the first cop takes out his book, starts writing. he's pissed.}
<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{i gotta file a..report tonight asshole...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{goes with the territory.}
<A>__{he grabs hammond and they head for the cadillac.}
