<A>__{ike watches as maggie takes the heat, raising her glass along with the others. bob raises his glass like the good sport he is. ike can't believe it.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{you know the old saying, "you're not losing a daughter..." well, i'd like to! walter gets a bit laugh. he goes again.}
<C>__{walter }
<A>__{maggie may not be hale's longest running joke...}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<A>__{maggie finishes the punchline along with his father.}
<C>__{walter and maggie}
<A>__{ but she's certainly the fastest. uproarious laughter. maggie looks terribly pained. ike's had enough. he pushes himself to his feet. walter is thrilled. he shushes the crowd.}
<C>__{walter }
<A>__{oh, look, mr. graham, how about a toast?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i don't know, give me a minute.}

<A>__{are you all right with this? you think this is funny?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{yes.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i don't and i don't think you should...}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{it's a joke. they're kidding.}
<C>__{walter and crowd}
<P>__{(yell)}
<A>__{come on and give us a toast.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{you want me to make a toast? okay... i will give you a toast. to maggie's family and friends. may you find yourselves the bull's eye of an easy target. may you be publicly flogged for all of your bad choices and may your noses to rubbed in all of your mistakes... ike watches their reaction. the silence is deafening. all the guests stare at maggie. mortified, she holds back tears.}
<C>__{mrs. trout}
<A>__{that was funny.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<A>__{but enough toasts, let's hula. let's start the music up. she gets everyone up to hula. band plays fast tune. maggie walks through the crowd down the steps and outside. ike follows, but peggy grabs a coat for her. bob watches her go as cory approaches.}
<C>__{cory}
<A>__{hey, bob. i got twenty dollars bet on }
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{not now. bob rushes after maggie.}

<A>__{maggie. maggie.}
<P>__{(to ike, handing him a jacket)}
<A>__{here. she may need this. it's not really hawaii. ike exits. then, bob comes over.}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{where'd maggie go?}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{oh, she just went to get me something from the car. cory comes over with dennis to bob and peggy. bob peggy cory dennis chuffa: about bart starr and football. (which keeps bob from going outside to follow maggie). bob thinks about it.}
