<L>__{interior beechcraft plane day (flying)}
<A>__{clarice's pov out the plane's window, at the landscape far below. wisps of cloud, a quilt of farms. clarice turns from the window, looks at a think folder in her lap. the cover reads "case file: buffalo bill." clarice is moody, distracted. she hesitates, then opens the file, begins to scan. inserts her pov police forms, some handwritten... typed lab reports; we catch words, phrases: "autopsy protocols", "histamine analysis"... grainy enlargements of bullet slugs, showing matched grooves... and then a stack of victim photos. the first one, taken from a good distance away, shows a nude female body, face down on a pebbly riverbank, surrounded by bits of litter. clarice hesitates again, then flips this photo to look at the nexterior it makes her flinch, just slightly. quickly she turns through several more photographs, trying hard to concentrate.}
<C>__{crawford }
<D>__{he keeps them alive for three days.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{shows crawford standing over her, swaying with the plane's motion. behind him, the open cockpit door, the pilot's back. crawford sits, removing sunglasses. he rubs his eyes.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{why, we don't yet know... there's no evidence of rape or physical abuse prior to death. all the mutilation you see there is post mortem.}
<P>__{(a beat; he glances at her)}
<D>__{i'm hot, are you hot? bobby, it's too damned hot back here...}
<A>__{the pilot adjusts a valve. crawford turns to her again.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{so. three days. then he shoots them, skins them usually just the torsos and dumps them. each body in a different river, in a different state, downstream from an interstate highway. the water leaves us no fingerprints, fibers, dna fluids no trace evidence at all. that's fredrica bimmel, the first one...}
<A>__{a color photo in clarice's hands shows a pretty, plump cheeked brunette, in her high school graduation cap and gown. she smiles at us with touching optimism.}
<C>__{crawford }
<D>__{a big girl, like all the rest. went about 160... her corpse was the only one he took the trouble to weight down, so actually, she was the third girl found. after her, he got lazy...}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{as clarice stares at the girl's face, moved. crawford pulls a map from the file, spreads it out. it shows the central and eastern u.s., with widely spaced, hand drawn markings.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{blue square for belvedere, ohio, where the bimmel girl was abducted. blue triangle where her body was found down here in missouri. same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. this new one, today... washed up here.}
<P>__{(he marks with a flair pen)}
<D>__{elk river, in west virginia, about six miles below u.s. 79. real boonies.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{there's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?}
<P>__{(he shakes his head)}
<D>__{what if what if you trace the heaviest traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? do they converge at all?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{good idea, but he thought of it, too. we've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. you put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. no, this one is different. this one has seen us coming...}
