<A>__{amelia in a flying outfit. hands on her hips as if posing.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{there’s a beatrix potter story about a cat named simpkin.}
<A>__{pull back to see the photographer, george beside him. they are on a hotel rooftop, precariously high above boston.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{he wasn’t happy unless he had several mice, each under a different teacup. so he could never become bored.}
<A>__{we see that amelia’s pose looks exactly the same as a photo of charles lindbergh in the photographer’s hand. it is labeled ‘lucky lindy.’}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{the illusion of activity was essential for him to feel at peace.}
<A>__{the photographer now shows george another photo of lindbergh in a different pose.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{what are you boys doing over there?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{trying to make you look like a girl.}
<A>__{george studies the photo, then goes to amelia and begins moving her body into the new pose. tilting her head to lindbergh's angle.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{i wondered. was i mr. putnam’s 43rd mouse? or his 307th.}
<A>__{now touching her, adjusting her coat, fluffing a bit of her hair, pulling the collar around to frame her face...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the more we can make you look like a girl, the better.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{oh god, is it worth the effort?}
<A>__{he cocks his head, studies her. nah, guess not.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{wondering who should play you in the film of all this. i'm thinking chaplin.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{valentino's not available?}
<A>__{he shakes his head sadly. adjusts her collar once more. this time, his hands linger.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{two things. one, chaplin can't play me because he's perfect for you. and two, you have company.}
<A>__{she glances to where a woman, beautiful and aristocratic, is being helped onto the roof. george's face lights to see her. he rushes over, sweeps her into his arms, kisses her tenderly. amelia smiles to see this, makes her like them both.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{amelia earhart, this is dorothy binney putnam.}
<A>__{the women trade smiles. they shake hands, holding eye contact.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{great to meet you. george talks so much about you.}
<P>__{(a wink)}
<D>__{in fact, lately, you're all he does talk about.}
<A>__{george steps in close, and the photographer snaps a three shot. and another.}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{hold those smiles for one more, please.}
