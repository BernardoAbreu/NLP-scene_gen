<L>__{interior norman's room in the old house (day)}
<A>__{lila is standing in the doorway, staring at the room in sick dismay. the room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fantasy of childhood held beyond the point of decency. it is a small room. the walls are fancied with romping silhouettes of teddy bears and sailboats and carousels and fat cows jumping over aghast moons. the bed is small, far too short for a man of norman's height. and yet the rumpled covers indicate that it is in this bed that norman sleeps. next to the bed is an old fashioned toy chest. on its top there are a bird in a cage lamp, a plain bound book, and an ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. a grown man's shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree. against one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled with thick, unchildish looking books. on the small, white chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. the record on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to be beethoven's eroica symphony. lila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. she glances at the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcase and pulls out a thick, large, plain bound book. she opens it. her eyes go wide in shock. and then there is disgust. she slams the book closed, drops it.}
