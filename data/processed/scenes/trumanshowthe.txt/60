<A>__{truman turns into his street but stops several houses short of his own driveway and kills the car's engine. in the light of a streetlamp, truman opens his briefcase and removes the framed photograph of his wife, meryl. but he turns his wife's face away from him and opens the clasps on the back of the frame. removing the backing, he exposes the composite picture of sylvia we witnessed in the flashback of his youth, worn and faded by the years. with the frame on his lap, truman retrieves a handful of paper fragments from his jacket. noses. he tests the likeness of each one in turn. unsatisfied that any of the new noses is an improvement, truman tosses them out of his car window. we watch the paper fragments blowing in the breeze as truman's car proceeds down the street and into his driveway.}
