<A>__{the old black lady motions to trask who crosses to her. she points to a picture in the file. she has obviously found her missing person among the photographs of the unidentified dead. she starts to stand but then sits again, obviously shaken. klute crosses to her and gently helps her out of the chair. he sees in her face the same sense of loss he feels for his friend.}
