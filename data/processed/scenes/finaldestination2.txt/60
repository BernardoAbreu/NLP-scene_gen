<T>__{hard cut to:}
<L>__{interior thomas' apartment later}
<A>__{reveal nora, rory, and kat, mortified, sit on a couch. it's obvious the bomb's been dropped, reality has set in. clear and kimberly await their reactions. nora raises a trembling hand.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{does anybody have a valium?}
<A>__{kat opens her purse and hands her a blue pill.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{you'll want to take }
<A>__{nora pops it in her mouth.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{ half of that.}
<A>__{nora chews, her eyes half dead from bereavement. across the loft, thomas paces, phone in hand.}
<C>__{thomas}
<P>__{(quietly, into phone)}
<D>__{any word yet on the dodge van? damn.}
<A>__{eugene alone seems unafraid. he uses a grabber a long pole with movable claw on the end to open the skylight. when done, he balances the long pole precariously against the wall. an ominous breeze enters. clear notices magazine pages blowing over the desk by the couch.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{so that would mean... i'm nexterior}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{nobody's nexterior this is crazy. first death's stalking us and now premonitions?}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{this can't be happening. my career's at a peak, i finally met a cute guy, i just bought a new house...}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.}
<A>__{kat's hands ball into fists. the hatred is mutual. clear reaches for a nearby cardboard box on the desk, noticing magazine pages blowing over until their weight tips over a pencil holder which spills pens out. she takes the box to nora.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{you're not next, nora. nobody has to be nexterior that's the pointerior last time, we didn't plan. we weren't organized. now we can help each other.}
<A>__{she reaches into the box and passes out cell phones to nora and the others.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{think what would have happened if kimberly had been able to warn you with the word pigeons...}
<A>__{nora's head falls. kimberly senses her anguish and takes over.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{the point is, as long as you know what to beware of, you have a fighting chance. it can be beaten. if i call you and say subway, get to a high rise fast. a place where no subway could possibly go, get it?}
<A>__{everyone nods in understanding. rory fidgets, sniffling, then pounds the table in frustration. startling kat.}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{why the hell did i ever get on route 18 in the first place? that's me, mr. dumb fucking luck.}
<A>__{clear, very alert, looks at the tipped pencil holder. pens roll toward the end of the desk, toward a large white pages directory which hangs precariously off the edge just so.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{anyone read today's paper? the article on evan shaeffer?}
<A>__{no one says a word.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{the only reason he was on route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{that lucky bastard.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{what about the rest of you? kimberly, you were driving to daytona. was route 18 your first choice?}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{the new freeway was faster, but route 18 was the way my mom used to take, so...}
<A>__{they take turns going around the room.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{route 18 is drake's assignment, but he called in sick so i got...}
<P>__{(blanches)}
<D>__{drake's never sick.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{i was my first day of jury duty.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{jury duty? that's randomly selected by social security numbers.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{random, sure.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{what, you think death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago? you're nuts.}
<A>__{clear fumes. rory looks ill and reaches into his wallet.}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{last july i dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. they asked me what number means "good luck" in jewish.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{eighteen. and it's "hebrew".}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{anyway, i guessed it right and won these.}
<A>__{rory holds up two yankee tickets.}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{the best way to get to yankee stadium is route 18.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that death would set you up nine months in advance.}
<C>__{thomas}
<P>__{(realization)}
<D>__{whoa, nine months?}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{are you thinking what i'm thinking?}
