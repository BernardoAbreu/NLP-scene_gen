<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{`dearest cosette, you have entered my soul and soon you will be gone. can it be only a day since we met and the world was reborn? if i should fall in the battle to come let this be my goodbye. now that i know you love me as well it is harder to die. i pray that god will bring me home to be with you. pray for your marius. he prays for you.'}
<A>__{he looks up, deeply distressed. he can't bear the thought of losing cosette.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{they haven't got a chance, these boys they almost certainly will die she'll be alone and she will need me all the more and we will go on as before when he is gone i dare not think like this i must find this boy}
