<L>__{interior county jail visiting booths day}
<A>__{john waits alone on the visitors' side of the glass. the door opens, and lara steps up on the other side. john smiles and picks up the phone, but lara sees something in his face and doesn't pick up her phone, just stares at him. john fights to keep his smile and nods for her to pick up her phone but now she can see the verdict chiseled on his face. lara gasps and cries inconsolably. john keeps the smile plastered on his face, but now tears run down his cheeks. he taps on the glass and points at her phone, but she doesn't respond. he taps harder and harder desperately wanting to comfort her, but she won't allow it. he bangs on the glass with his fist, drawing the attention of the guard on his side. lara turns and exits. john stands and yells her name, but she can't hear it, and neither can we.}
