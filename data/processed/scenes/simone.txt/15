<D>__{valarie! valarie!}
<A>__{finally, out of the fog a young woman in a black cape and hood, her back to us. the camera pushes in, music swells and she turns. simone. she is exquisitely, ethereally beautiful. perfect.}
<L>__{interior rundown downtown cinema auditorium night}
<A>__{in the near empty, dilapidated theater, "sunrise, sunset" is playing on the screen. when simone's face appears, the faces of the audience members change. they are all visibly moved, including the theater owner. some weeping, some with curious smiles on their faces, some opened mouthed.}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(on screen, approaching)}
<D>__{valarie, what are you running from?}
<C>__{simone}
<P>__{(enigmatic smile)}
<D>__{from valarie.}
<A>__{suddenly a gunshot rings out. simone collapses to the ground.}
<C>__{hal}
