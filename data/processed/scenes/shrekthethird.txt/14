<L>__{interior shrek and fiona's bedroom night}
<A>__{the door to fiona's room flies open.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{that's it! we're leaving!}
<A>__{shrek storms in pulling bits of buffet food off his face.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{honey, please calm down...}
<A>__{shrek grabs the wig off of his head and throws it aside.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{calm down? who do you think we're kidding? i am an ogre! i'm not cut out for this, fiona and i never will be.}
<A>__{shrek wipes off his makeup with his shirt sleeve and flings his shirt to the floor. he falls onto the bed next to donkey.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{i think that went pretty well.}
<A>__{shrek startles.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{donkey!}
<A>__{shrek picks him up and throws him out the door.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{aww, come on now shrek!}
<A>__{shrek slams the door shut. shrek turns back towards the bed and sees puss reclining on his pillow.}
<D>__{shrek the third final screening script 13.}
<C>__{puss}
<D>__{some people just don't understand boundaries.}
<A>__{shrek picks puss up by the scruff of his neck and tosses him outside the window. he shuts it. puss sits sadly on the ledge, giving shrek his sad eyes routine. shrek draws the blinds. shrek stomps over and falls back onto the bed. fiona tries to calm him down.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{just think... a couple more days, and we'll be back home in our vermin filled shack, strewn with fungus, filled with the rotting stench of mud and neglect.}
<A>__{this thought calms him. shrek takes in a long, deep breath and exhales. he smiles.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh, you had me at "vermin filled."}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{and, uh... maybe even the pitter patter of little feet on the floor...?}
<C>__{shrek}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{that's right. the swamp rats will be spawning.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{uh, no... you know, what i was thinking of is a little bit bigger than a swamp rat.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{donkey?}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{no, shrek. um... what if theoretically }
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{they were little ogre feet? shrek the third final screening script 14.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(nervous laugh)}
<A>__{shocked, shrek falls off the bed. he slowly emerges from behind the bed.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{honey? let's try and be rational about this. have you seen a baby lately? they just eat and poop and they cry and then they cry when they poop and they poop when they cry...now, imagine an ogre baby. they extra cry and they extra poop.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{shrek.}
<A>__{she grabs his hands and looks deeply into his eyes.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{don't you ever think about having a family?}
<A>__{shrek takes her hand.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{right now, you're my family.}
<A>__{there is a knock on the bedroom door. the door bursts open, revealing a royal page. shrek springs up.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{well, somebody better be dying.}
