<T>__{open on:}
<L>__{exterior gascony dawn}
<A>__{dawn. a verdant field in gascony. birds call from treetops. the wind rustles through green leaves. a fox darts into a thick hedge. and last, anti pastoral, out of place the sound of clashing steel. superimpose: france, 1625. suddenly, two young men burst into view, sword points cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. the first is girard, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every facet. the second, d'artagnan. younger in appearance and attitude. exuberant, handsome. and at just this moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous cry. they battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew. girard is the more polished combatant. but d'artagnan is nearly a force of nature. he whips his sword through the air with wild hearted abandon. he tumbles and somersaults. this is fun. girard and d'artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. as they fight, both men utilize a variety of props. handfuls of hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots. anything goes as the swords cut through the air. d'artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces girard up against a peaceful country manor. girard, seemingly cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof, fights from this high angle. d'artagnan merely smiles... and follows.}
<B>__{angle on rooftop}
<A>__{seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, girard and d'artagnan scramble up the v shaped rooftop, pause to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other side, attacking, defending, as they go.}
<B>__{include interior}
<A>__{inside the manor house, a handsome woman of forty glances up from her writing table, hears footsteps on the roof. she reacts curious, not afraid and steps to an open window. as if to follow the footsteps to the other side.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{girard leaps to the ground first landing in an enclosure filled with squawking geese. d'artagnan flies after. the geese scatter, d'artagnan whose wild progress frequently resembles that of a young colt stumbles briefly. girard seeks advantage, thrusts his sword toward the young man's heart. but d'artagnan parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over the offending goose glances deadpan apology and rises to fight again. the epic battle continues. girard's modest success devolves into desperate flight. d'artagnan's seemingly endless reserves are wearing him down. then, at the last possible moment, girard spies escape: a slowmoving haycart ruimbling up the country road. he runs toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'artagnan with a confident smirk an expression that vanishes when the young gascon executes a nearly impossible leap to join him. and still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morning all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. just then: the haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. girard backs from d'artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he stumbles. d'artagnan has his man and he knows it. he prepares one last blow and the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the side and down to the small muddy creek below. a comical antidote to all this glorious swordplay.}
<B>__{include creek}
<A>__{girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of reach. d'artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation will allow. he rolls toward girard, sword in hand, and lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's apple. a long beat. then a surprise. girard begins to laugh, long and loud. d'artagnan responds with a charmed smile.}

<C>__{jussac}
<D>__{release that man!!}
<A>__{happy to comply, porthos lets go of the guard who plunges to the street with a dull thud. then, with a wink and a piratical grin, porthos ducks inside. jussac darkens, signals his men, and they rush toward the tavern.}

<A>__{jussac and his company burst in and discover the room in a shambles, the aftermath of a violent fight. but for now, all is calm. a group of the cardinal's guards is seated around a big table littered with flagons and bottles. on the floor around them are their swords and rifles. it appears the gruards are celebrating a victory. but wait. there's something wrong with this picture. on closer inspection, we see that the guards have been stripped to their underclothes and tied to their chairs with ropes. they are all bruised and bloody. some are unconscious. presiding over the "celebration" are two musketeers. they sit at the head of the table, relaxing with their boots up. one of them casually cleans his sword with a lace handkerchief. he is aramis, the most handsome and dashing of the musketeers a poet and idealist a gentleman of great personal charm and style. his companion is athos, the musketeers' deadliest and most charismatic member also its most mysterious and tortured. athos is the unofficial leader of the three musketeers, their planner and strategist. at the moment, he's sewing up a nasty gash on his right arm.}

<A>__{pandemonium, inside and outside the palace. athos, porthos, and aramis emerge from the crowd at the entrance, draw their swords, and prepare to rush the long line of guards protecting the doors. the guards cannot believe what they are seeing. three men against a hundred. it's ridiculous. but then... the looks on guards' faces begin to change, subtly at first, from amusement to horror.}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{behind athos, porthos, and aramis, something incredible happens. musketeers appear from every direction. some from the surrounding crowd. some from buildings, rooftops. others appear on horseback, a few disguised as monks. and all defiantly wearing their blue and gold tunics. the murmur of the crowd becomes an excited roar. the corps of musketeers line up behind athos, porthos, and aramis. porthos and aramis exchange a smile. athos keeps his usually dour expression. but his eyes are charged with excitement. they raise their arms, and face the long line of guards. a hundred sabers flash in the sunlight.}

<A>__{the great door shudders under the impact of a terrific blow. another boom and the great hall is plunged into further chaos. the regiment of guards rush forward, press their bodies against the door to secure it. boom the great door threatens to split in half. richelieu huddles with rochefort amid the rising panic. his eyes narrow to mean slits, he gestures toward louis and anne across the room.}

<A>__{rochefort takes confident steps toward the king. but one last boom and the great door comes crashing down on the guards, revealing a tide of musketeers on the other side. athos, porthos, and aramis at the lead. louis breaks into a wide grin. the musketeers wade into the guards, and the great hall is transformed into a battlefield. rochefort turns, sees athos charging at him.}

<D>__{not for long.}

<C>__{constance}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{anne looks up. constance tosses the goblet to her. anne catches it neatly, brings it down on the head of the hapless guard. constance smiles, leaps forward. aramis cuts down a guard. as another man comes at him from behind, porthos intervenes, runs the man through. the two musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks, and continue. athos and rochefort slash at each other. it is a mighty confrontation. but athos soon gains the upper hand. rochefort shouts to a nearby guard for help. now it's two on one. athos receives a wound in the shoulder, he staggers... and the treaty falls from his tunic to the floor. rochefort reacts with a start, he grabs the treaty, stuffs it into his doublet. athos shakes off the sudden pain, disposes of the guard. rochefort and athos face each other a second time. athos wounded, rochefort confident he can finish the injured musketeer. but athos merely changes sword hands. rochefort reacts. their sabers clash as they draw together. rochefort grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand. but athos sees it coming, and smashes rochefort across the face with his fist. rochefort goes sprawling. he loses his sword, it slides across the floor until someone's foot stops it. rochefort looks up... and sees d'artagnan standing on the blade.}

<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{one thing's certain. you're no musketeer.}
<A>__{but d'artagnan remembers athos' advice. "always find your enemy's weakness." he shoves a thumb into rochefort's good eye. rochefort stumbles backward. d'artagnan plunges his sword into monsieur cyclops's heart.}

<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{no!!}
<A>__{richelieu smiles, hurls the treaty into the blazing fireplace. as the flames begin to lick at the parchment paper, d'artagnan flies past the cardinal, and dives after to retrieve it. athos, porthos, and aramis enter the room. d'artagnan stumbles out of the fireplace, covered with soot, clutching the treaty. he grins. on d'artagnan's look of triumph...}
