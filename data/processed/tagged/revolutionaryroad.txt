<L>__{interior greenwich village apartment night, 1947. flashback.}
<A>__{a party of bohemian types in the village. artist's canvases propped up against the walls. a narrow hallway with couples talking intimately. two rooms crammed with young people smoking and drinking. a man and a woman in their 20's stand alone in a corner... frank wheeler, intelligent good looks, and april johnson, a patrician beauty, a woman amongst girls. he's been making her laugh.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{so, what do you do?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i'm studying to be an actress. you?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm a longshoreman.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{no, i mean really.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i mean really too. starting monday, though, i'm doing something a little more glamorous. night cashier at a cafeteria.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i don't mean how you make money. i mean what are you interested in?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{honey if i had the answer to that one, i bet i'd bore us both to death in half an hour.}
<A>__{she laughs. he smiles, revelling in her attention.}
<L>__{interior greenwich village apartment night, 1947, later.}
<A>__{later, frank and april dance. they move well, in sync, looking into each other's eyes. he slides his hand down the silk of april's dress until it rests in the small of her back. close on their hands. their fingers slowly entwine as they lose themselves in each other...}
<T>__{smash cut to:}
<L>__{interior auditorium night, present.}
<A>__{close on frank's face, seven years later, full of doubt and tension as he watches his wife, april, on stage and as we hear the hollow voices of a very bad amateur play... finally, mercifully, the curtain falls. nothing. then vigorous, relieved applause. frank hears a voice from behind, through the applause:}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{thank god that's over...}
<A>__{april takes the final bow. she's fighting not to cry. frank applauds her loudly. looks around to see who else is joining him. but there is no noticeable crescendo in the applause. then frank hears the voice again:}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{...and she was very disappointing.}
<A>__{he can't argue.}
<L>__{interior high school auditorium night, moments later.}
<A>__{frank now moves against the crowd of exiting audience members towards the stage. he keeps his head lowered, avoiding eye contact, until he feels a hand on his sleeve. mr. and mrs. givings, an older couple, are standing in his way.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{frank! very nice frank!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{thanks, mrs. givings.}
<A>__{frank steps around her.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{i can't tell you how much we enjoyed it. you have a very talented wife.}
<A>__{frank forces a smile as he goes.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i will pass it along!}
<L>__{interior dressing room night.}
<A>__{april sits alone at her dressing table crying.}
<L>__{interior back stage night.}
<A>__{the cast mills backstage. the mood is subdued, but some have decided to make light of the disaster. frank moves through the crowd. across the room, he sees milly campbell, 30's, determinedly bright, up on her tip toes. her husband shep, 30's, heavy set, is still in costume, shell shocked and pebbled with sweat.}
<C>__{milly}
<D>__{frank!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hi!}
<C>__{milly}
<D>__{she's through there...!}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{you `bout ready for that drink?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{couple of minutes!}
<L>__{interior dressing room night.}
<A>__{frank enters. the chair in front of the mirror is empty. a cigarette burns in the ashtray. frank glances at a standing screen in the corner. april's costume is draped over the top. he goes towards it, deciding what to say.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(heartfelt)}
<D>__{april, sweetheart. you were great. i mean it.}
<A>__{the door to the bathroom opens. april enters in street clothes. frank's been talking to an empty room.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{hi. you about ready to leave? i've just got to get this makeup off, then we can go.}
<A>__{she sits in front of the mirror, too embarrassed to look at him. frank can see that her face is blotchy from crying. he puts his hand on her shoulder.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well... i guess it wasn't a triumph or anything, was it?}
<A>__{april looks at him in the mirror. she holds his look just a second. and from her expression, he knows he said exactly the wrong thing.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i guess not. i will be ready in a minute.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{take your time.}
<A>__{he removes his hands and lights a cigarette. april begins to take off her makeup.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{will you do me a favor? milly and shep wanted us to go out with them afterwards. will you say we can't? say it's because of the baby sitter or something?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, the thing is, i already said that we could. i mean, i just saw them out there and i said we would.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(tense)}
<D>__{oh. then would you mind going out again and saying you were mistaken? that should be simple enough.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't you think that's a little bit rude, april?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{well i will tell them myself.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay. okay. take it easy. i will tell them.}
<A>__{he backs to the door.}
<L>__{interior high school corridor night.}
<A>__{april and frank walk down a long empty echoing corridor, past school lockers, booster club posters and silent classrooms. they don't touch. they don't speak. the tension between them is palpable.}
<L>__{interior wheeler car night.}
<A>__{frank drives. april stares ahead. their faces are lit by the dashboard. after a while...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i mean it, baby. you were the only person in that play.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he looks over at her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we just never should've let you get mixed up in the damned thing.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you've studied for christ's sake.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{could we sort of stop talking about it now?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sure. i just don't want you feeling bad about it, that's all. because it's not worth it. i mean, it's bad enough having to live out here among these damn people what'd you say?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i said yes. all right, frank. could you just stop talking now, before you drive me crazy, please?}
<A>__{frank clenches his jaw and flips on the indicator.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{what are you doing? why are we stopping?}
<L>__{exterior highway night.}
<A>__{the car comes to a stop at the side of the road.}
<L>__{interior wheeler car night.}
<A>__{frank turns off the ignition. he slides towards her.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{no, frank, please don't...}
<A>__{he puts his arms around her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{baby, it's okay...}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{please don't touch me.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{april...}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{why can't you...just... leave me alone!}
<A>__{frank slides back behind the wheel. beat.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it strikes me, that there's a considerable amount of bullshit going on here.... and there's one or two things i'd like to clear up. number one, it's not my fault the play was lousy. number two, it's sure as hell not my fault you didn't turn out to be an actress, and the sooner you get over that little piece of soap opera the better off we'll both be. number three, i don't happen to fit the role of dumb, insensitive suburban husband; you've been trying to hang that one on me ever since we moved here. number four }
<A>__{she opens the door and is out of the car, flashing across the headlights. frank struggles with his door.}
<L>__{exterior highway shoulder night.}
<A>__{april stands in the dark 30 yards from the road looking over an expansive countryside. there's only a few lights in the distance. this is still farmland. frank comes up behind her, careful to keep his distance.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing? come back to the car.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{no. just let me stand here a second.}
<A>__{frank raises his arms in exasperation. a car approaches. he puts a hand in his pocket and tries to look casual. the car's headlights light up april's back, then pass.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{april?}
<A>__{she doesn't move.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{look, can't we sit in the car and talk about it, instead of running all over route twelve?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{haven't i made it clear i don't particularly want to talk about it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay. jesus, i'm trying to be nice about this thing.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{how kind of you. how terribly, terribly kind of you.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{wait a minute. i don't deserve this.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{you're always so wonderfully definite, aren't you, on the subject of what you do and don't deserve?}
<A>__{she turns and walks past him back towards the car.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{wait a minute!}
<A>__{he stumbles after her. other cars whizz by, but he's past caring.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{wait a minute, god damn it!}
<A>__{she leans against the car and folds her arms.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{you listen to me. this is one time you're not going to get away with twisting everything i say.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{christ, i wish you'd stayed home tonight!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you know what you are when you're like this? you're sick. i really mean that. you're sick!}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{and you know what you are?}
<P>__{(eyes raking him)}
<D>__{you're disgusting.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh, yeah?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{just because you've got me safely in this little trap, you think you can bully me into feeling whatever you want!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you in a trap! you in a trap! jesus, don't make me laugh!}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{yes, me.}
<P>__{(clutching at her chest)}
<D>__{me! me! me! oh, you poor, pathetic little boy look at you! look at you, and tell me how by any stretch of the imagination you can call yourself a man!}
<A>__{he raises his fist, she flinches away, and bong! bong! bong! bong! he punches the hood of the car. then, silence. the look april gives him is probably the worst look he's ever received: a look of pitying boredom.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't look at me like that, april.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{could we please go home now?}
<A>__{she calmly walks around and gets in the car. after a moment, frank follows...}

<L>__{exterior midtown street morning.}
<A>__{knox headquarters a squat, formidable structure. thick honking traffic. crowded sidewalks. frank walks with the crowd past a display window: bright cardboard images of fashionable women grin and point their pencils at a list of product benefits "speed, accuracy, control." pride of place at the center of the display is a new knox 500 electronic computer with a sign that reads: "performs a man's lifetime of work in just 30 minutes!"}
<L>__{interior knox building elevator morning.}
<A>__{frank rides crushed against the wall in a crowded elevator. he glances over at maureen grube, 23, ripe, a little obvious, but undeniably sexy. she meets his look. and looks away.}

<A>__{frank opens the bottom right drawer of his desk, props up his feet and lights a cigarette.}

<D>__{i'm going to need your help this morning, old scout.}
<A>__{seated beside frank, jack ordway, 40's, tall and effete with greying hair, appears to be hard at work, hunched over a file. he is, in fact, propping up his head with his hand while shielding his eyes.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{for the next few hours, you're to warn me of bandy's every approach and you may have to screen me from public view in the likely event i that i throw up. it's that bad.}

<D>__{good morning, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nothing good about it, i assure you.}

<A>__{april drags two overflowing garbage cans to the curb. she stops and looks down the empty road. not a single human being in sight. close on april's face.}

<A>__{mrs. givings sits behind the wheel, driving slowly along a suburban street talking at high speed. frank sits beside her wearing sunglasses. april sits in the back. we don't yet see what mrs. givings is describing, only as it plays on their faces.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{of course, i knew the moment you came off the train what you were looking for... a small remodeled barn, or a carriage house and i just hate to be the one to tell you that sort of thing just isn't available anymore... but i don't want you to despair. there is one place down here i want to show you... now of course it isn't very desirable at this end.}
<P>__{(gestures)}
<D>__{as you see, crawford road is mostly these little cinder blocky, pick up trucky places plumbers, carpenters, little local people of that sort.}
<A>__{frank turns around to april, lowers his glasses. april stifles a giggle.}
<C>__{mrs. givings }
<D>__{but eventually...}
<P>__{(she points, her arm fully extended)}
<D>__{eventually it leads up to revolutionary road, which is much nicer. now, the place i want to show you, is a sweet little house and a sweet little setting. simple, clean lines, good lawns, marvelous for children. it's right around this next curve... now, you'll see it there.}
<A>__{they all look.}
<C>__{mrs. givings }
<D>__{see the little white one? sweet isn't it? the perky way it sits there on its little slope? charming, isn't it?}

<D>__{oh, yes.}
<L>__{interior bandy's office day. present.}

<A>__{bandy holds out an envelope from behind his desk.}
<C>__{bandy}
<D>__{came for you from toledo this morning.}

<D>__{this is the third one this month.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh, right, sorry. i thought i'd taken care of that...}
<A>__{frank reaches again, but bandy moves it. a little man enjoying his power.}
<C>__{bandy}
<D>__{i'm not prepared to have this conversation again, frank. you understand?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{...absolutely, yes.}
<C>__{bandy}
<D>__{these folks in the provinces look up to us, frank. we need to be efficient. we can't have this kind of back and forth, and so forth. it's just not efficient. am i right?}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't insult me.}

<A>__{frank stands over maureen at her desk. the envelope from toledo lies in front of her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{now, if you'll look in the inactive file under sp 1109 you'll find copies of all the stuff we sent to the agency... and that way we can trace the thing back to its original sources.}
<A>__{she nods, jotting down a note. for the first time, frank allows himself to take in her profile, her cleavage, her lips.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{i hope you weren't planning on an early lunch.}

<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{the waiter brings over the phone. frank dials. he holds his finger to his lips. he uses an authoritative tone.}

<D>__{hello mrs. jorgensen. frank wheeler here. just wanted to let you know that i've had to send maureen grube down to visual aides for me. i will probably need her the rest of the day... okay? fine. you too.}
<A>__{frank hangs up and smiles at maureen.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{i never even heard of visual aides.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's because it doesn't exist.}
<A>__{maureen smiles.}
<L>__{interior wheeler hallway day.}

<D>__{only if you're having some.}

<C>__{april}
<D>__{yes. of course.}
<A>__{mrs. givings smiles. then, pretending to read the titles on a stack of books on the table...}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{it really is a marvellous facility and the treatments seem to be doing him wonders... anyway, they said getting out for an afternoon might do him some good.}
<A>__{she pauses on sartre's `nausea', looks at it vaguely.}
<C>__{mrs. givings }
<D>__{i think he finds my friends a little conventional, frankly. i mean, he's travelled. he has a phd in mathematics. i suppose you could say he's an intellectual. it would do him a world of good to meet a young couple like you.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{we'd love to helen.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{so, i thought perhaps if you had some time...}

<D>__{no. it certainly wasn't.}
<A>__{frank inspects the contents of the mantle: photos of maureen at the prom; maureen with her parents. maureen tentatively fingers her hair that has now gone to frizz. the sheet slips down. she grabs at it. then wills herself to calm down and act sophisticated.}

<D>__{no, i know, i know. i just have a couple of questions, is all. for one thing, do you mind telling me what exactly i'm supposed to be doing while you're out earning all this money?}
<A>__{she draws back, shocked that he doesn't get it.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{don't you see that's the whole idea? you'll be doing what you should've been allowed to do seven years ago. you'll have time, frank. you'll have time to find out what it is that you actually want to do, and when you figure it out you'll have the time and the freedom to start doing it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sweetheart, it's just not very realistic, is all.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{well, i happen to think this is unrealistic. i think it's unrealistic for a man with a fine mind to go on working like a dog year after year at a job he can't stand, coming home to a place he can't stand, to a wife who's equally unable to stand the same things.}
<A>__{frank is silent. how could anyone possibly argue with her?}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{you want to know the worst part? our whole existence here is based on this great premise that we're somehow very special and superior to the whole thing, and you know what i've realized...? we're not! we're just like everyone else. look at us! we've bought into the same ridiculous delusion. this idea that you have to resign from life and settle down the moment you have children. and we've been punishing each other for it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{listen: we decided to move out here. no one ever forced me to take the job at knox.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{i mean who ever said i was supposed to be a big deal, anyway?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{when i first met you, there was nothing in the world you couldn't do or be.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i was a little wise guy with a big mouth, that's all.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{you were not! how can you even say that?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{...all right... so, i will have time. and god knows that's appealing. it's very appealing. and i mean, everything you say might make a certain amount of sense, if i had some definite talent maybe. if i were an artist or a writer.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{but frank, listen to me: it's what you are that's being stifled here. it's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{and what's that?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{don't you know...?}
<A>__{he looks at her. she gazes back at him.}

<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{oh, look at all this food! you didn't have to go to any trouble for us.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{it's just some sandwiches.}

<D>__{john, would you like a sandwich?}

<D>__{i think i can do that.}
<A>__{mr. givings eats his sandwich, watching his son.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{oh, this is the most wonderful egg salad, april. you must tell me how you fix it.}

<A>__{mr. givings gives his son a level, warning look.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{see, i've got a good many questions to ask and i'm willing to pay for the answers... now, i don't need to be told that a man who goes after his mother with a coffee table is putting himself in a weak position legally; that's obvious.}

<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{john, come and have a look out this fabulous picture window.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{whaddya do it for then?}

<D>__{maybe frank doesn't want to be questioned like this, son.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay, okay, okay i know it's none of my business. and besides, i know the answer. you want to play house, you got to have a job. you want to play very nice house, very sweet house, then you got to have a job you don't like. anyone comes along and asks "whaddya do it for?' he's probably on a four hour pass from the state funny farm. all agreed...? ma?}

<C>__{mr. givings}
<D>__{sorry, frank.}
<C>__{frank}

<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{...john, please.}
<C>__{mr. givings}
<D>__{steady down, son.}
<A>__{april looks at frank the whole thing is in danger of going off the rails.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{how about some fresh air, john?}
<A>__{john stops laughing abruptly. he looks to his parents.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{if that's all right with you?}

<C>__{john}
<P>__{(mimicking)}
<D>__{`how awful...' why, because mathematics is so `interesting?'}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{no. because the shocks must be awful and... well, because it's awful not to be able to do what it is you want to do. i think mathematics are dull.}

<D>__{i like your girl, frank.}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't think i suggested we talk about everything all the time. my point was, we've both been under a strain and we ought to be trying to help each other as much as we can right now.}

<C>__{april}
<D>__{why did you?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{baby, i don't know. i think it was a simple case of wanting to be a man again after all that abortion business. some kind of neurotic, irrational need to prove something.}

<D>__{no. i don't mean why did you have the girl; i mean why did you tell me about it?}

<D>__{do you want me to scream again, frank? because i will, if you say another word! i mean it!}
<A>__{frank has no choice they're outside. the neighbors would hear and call the police. he reluctantly backs away, then turns back the way he came, glancing over his shoulder as he goes.}
<L>__{interior wheeler family room night.}
<A>__{frank stands at the window watching the section of woods where he left april. then, he sees her come back across the street. she walks around the side of the house. he turns and runs into the kitchen.}
<L>__{interior wheeler kitchen night.}
<A>__{frank goes to the window. he watches april walk up into the yard and stop against a tree. frank pours a drink and takes the bottle with him to the window. he looks out, drinking. in the darkness, he can make out the glow of april's cigarette deep in the woods.}
<L>__{interior frank and april's bedroom night, later.}
<A>__{frank falls back on the bed. he's now very drunk. his eyes close as he slips into unconsciousness.}
<L>__{interior frank and april's bedroom morning.}
<A>__{frank wakes alone. he looks around the room. his head is throbbing.}
<L>__{interior wheeler kitchen morning.}
<A>__{frank stands in the doorway dressed for work. he stares... the kitchen has been tidied and is bathed in sunlight. the table has been carefully set for two. april stands at the stove wearing a fresh maternity dress. she seems serene. april turns and looks at him.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{good morning.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{he stands there frozen.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{would you like scrambled eggs or fried?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh. it doesn't really matter uh... scrambled, i guess, if it's easy.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{fine. i will have scrambled too.}
<A>__{frank sits at the table.}
<L>__{interior wheeler kitchen morning, moments later.}
<A>__{frank and april sit across the kitchen table, eating. for several moments, only the sound of their cutlery.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's kinda nice having breakfast without the kids for a change.}
<A>__{april reaches out to pour him some orange juice. her hands shake slightly.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{yes. i thought you'd probably want a good breakfast today. i mean it's kind of an important day for you, isn't it? isn't this the day you have your conference with pollock?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{yes. that's right, yes.}
<A>__{he shrugs.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{big deal.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i imagine it is a pretty big deal; for them, anyway. what exactly do you think you'll be doing? you never have told me much about it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{haven't i? well... i think this whole thing is about knox getting ready to buy up one of these really big computers, bigger than the `500'. did i tell you about that?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{no, i don't believe you did.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, you know basically it's just a...a big, fast adding machine. only...}
<A>__{he takes a pencil from his inside pocket and delicately sketches the computer on the napkin.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{instead of mechanical parts, you see, it's got thousands of little individual vacuum tubes.}
<A>__{she picks up the drawing and looks at it. it's surprisingly delicate.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{oh, i see. at least i think i see; yes. it's really sort of interesting, isn't it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, i don't know, it's yeah, i guess it is sort of interesting, in a way.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{you should value what you do frank. you're obviously good at it.}
<A>__{he smiles, flattered and surprised. he slips the pencil into the inside pocket of his suit.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{guess i'd better be getting started.}
<A>__{he stands. april stands up too, smoothing her skirt.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{listen, though, april; this was really nice... i mean it was a swell breakfast. really; i don't know when i've ever had a a nicer breakfast.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{thank you... i'm glad; i enjoyed it too.}
<A>__{they stand there gazing at one another across the table. suddenly, inexplicably, his eyes are filled with tears. he turns and walks to the door. he puts his hand on the handle and turns back once more.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{then you don't you don't hate me, or anything?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{no; of course i don't.}
<A>__{she comes over to him.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{have a good day.}
<A>__{he leans down and kisses her tenderly. they look at one another a moment longer.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay, then... so long.}
<A>__{he steps through the door. she catches the door before it shuts and watches him through the screen.}
<L>__{exterior wheeler driveway morning.}
<A>__{april walks out onto the driveway as the car reverses away down the drive.}
<L>__{interior wheeler car morning.}
<A>__{frank backs the car onto the road. he slides the car into drive and then catches sight of april in the driveway.}
<L>__{exterior wheeler driveway morning.}
<A>__{april sees frank looking back at her. she waves. frank waves from the car and drives off... then april is alone. she shivers from the morning chill. she turns and looks back at the house.}
<L>__{interior wheeler kitchen morning.}
<A>__{april enters through the screen door and goes to the table. she looks down at frank's diagram and carefully places it aside. she carries the dishes to the sink and begins to wash them. suddenly, her body convulses as she tries to hold back from crying. and then there is no stopping the tears...}
<L>__{interior wheeler hallway morning.}
<A>__{april is standing by the phone, with her hand on the receiver, rehearsing. she is smoking. she dials.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{hello... milly? everything all right? my voice sounds what...?}
<A>__{april uses both hands to grip the receiver.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{well, no, i'm afraid i'm not feeling any better... if it's not an inconvenience for you... this evening would be great. what...? oh, well no, not if they're outdoors playing. don't call them in.}
<A>__{the cigarette shreds in april's hand.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{just give them you know, give them each a kiss for me, and give them my love, and tell them you know... all right, milly. thanks.}
<A>__{she hangs up and begins to cry again. takes a breath.}
<L>__{interior wheeler hallway morning.}
<B>__{footsteps...}
<A>__{we move behind april as she walks through the silent house. the distant sound of children playing outside. each room she passes is a pocket of silence.}
<L>__{interior frank and april's bedroom morning.}
<A>__{april makes the bed. she arranges her shoes on the floor of the closet. april reaches onto a shelf behind some clothes. pulls out the brown paper package.}
<L>__{interior wheeler kitchen morning.}
<A>__{april stands at the stove over a pot of rolling, boiling water. she removes the rubber syringe from its paper packaging and drops it into the pot. she checks her watch.}
<L>__{interior wheeler hallway day.}
<A>__{april carries the pot of boiling, sudsy water down the hall.}
<L>__{interior wheeler bathroom day.}
<A>__{april places the pot into the tub. she lays towels across the floor. and closes the door...}
<L>__{interior wheeler bathroom day, moments later.}
<A>__{the sound of running water. the empty mirror. april's face rises up into the reflection with a gasp.}
<L>__{interior wheeler hallway day.}
<A>__{we move with april down the hallway, her face is pale.}
<L>__{interior wheeler living room day, later.}
<A>__{now april stands at the picture window. she is shaking. a droplet of blood slides down her knee. she looks down. on the floor, two droplets of blood appear between her bare feet... now we see the bright maple leaf of blood seeping through her skirt. she is shaking more. she walks slowly out of the room, towards the kitchen.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{i think i need an ambulance.... yes... one one five revolutionary road.}
<L>__{interior campbell kitchen day.}
<A>__{milly folds laundry. she looks up to see an ambulance turns into the wheeler's driveway. her face clouds with instinctual foreboding.}
<L>__{interior hospital hallway afternoon.}
<A>__{shep steps out into a hospital hallway. frank paces, helpless in the waiting room, his face a mask of bewildered, childlike confusion. he looks up to see shep coming towards him.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{frank? they tell you what happened?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jesus, shep. i couldn't even understand half the things he told me. he said the fetus was out before they got her here. he said they had to operate to take out the whatdycallit, the placenta and now she's still bleeding. he said she'd lost a lot of blood before the ambulance came, and now they're trying to stop it, and he said a whole lot of things i didn't get, about capillaries, and he said she's unconscious. jesus.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{how about sitting down, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what the hell do i want to sit down for!}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{okay. take it easy.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{my god.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{here, have a cigarette.}
<A>__{shep offers the pack. frank doesn't take one.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{she did it to herself, shep.}
<A>__{shep's face as he realizes what he's saying.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{she did it to herself.}
<A>__{shep takes a cigarette for himself. he lights it with trembling fingers.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{i will get some coffee.}
<A>__{frank looks over at shep as if he'd forgotten him. he nods. shep stands and walks down the hall.}
<L>__{interior hospital coffee machine afternoon.}
<A>__{shep stands at a coffee machine, gathering himself. he looks up. he begins to feed coins into the machine. his hands are trembling. he drops a coin. it rolls under the machine. he has to get down on his hands and knees to retrieve it...}
<L>__{interior hospital hallway afternoon.}
<A>__{shep walks tentatively, holding a cup in each hand, slopping coffee onto the floor... he rounds the corner and stops. frank is no longer in his chair at the end of the long echoing hallway. shep looks around... then suddenly, the double doors are flung open and a number of nurses hurry out. behind them, comes frank, supported by two doctors. shep runs to them as they move frank over to a chair. he's in shock.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no. no. no.}
<A>__{they try to make him sit, but he stays stubbornly on his feet, the chair skidding behind him.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{try to sit down, mr. wheeler.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{sit down frank.}
<A>__{frank looks at shep his face is a terrifying blank.}
<L>__{exterior revolutionary road magic hour.}
<A>__{a toyland of white and pastel houses along the road. the crisp green lawns. the blue televisions flickering behind the glass. we hear the whisk of running footsteps on the asphalt, the rush of a man's breath... frank is running down the middle of the street, tears streaming silently down his face...}
<L>__{interior campbell living room evening, one year later.}
<A>__{four high ball glasses with glistening cubes of ice. shep puts the finishing touches on four drinks. mr. and mrs. brace, a pleasant looking young couple fresh from the city sit on the couch.}
<C>__{milly}
<D>__{...it was the worst experience of my life. such wonderful people. weren't they shep? poor april.}
<A>__{shep picks up the drinks and carries them across the room. he stands there beside the three of them, but he can't bring himself to sit down and join in.}
<C>__{milly }
<D>__{frank lives in the city now. where is it he works?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{bart pollock associates.}

<C>__{milly}
<D>__{no. too many memories, i think. shep's seen him. in the city.}
<A>__{shep nods.}
<C>__{milly }
<D>__{he's just dedicated to those kids. every spare moment he has, he spends with them...}
<A>__{shep turns and walks out of the room.}
<L>__{exterior campbell house evening.}
<A>__{shep walks across the lawn to the edge of the property. he looks out over the suburban houses. at what was once the wheeler house. shep's face, looking out. his eyes are filled with tears. milly comes up behind him.}
<C>__{milly}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{mm hmm.}

<D>__{okay. we don't have to. we don't have to.}
<A>__{shep and milly look out over revolutionary road.}
<L>__{exterior city park day.}
<A>__{the same silence over a beautiful day in the city. and from the silence, the faint sound of wind through the leafy branches of trees. two children play in a playground in a small park. it's jennifer and michael. they seem happy, engrossed. other kids play around them. watching them from a bench is frank. he is a little older, a little thinner. close on frank's face. the sound of his children playing.}
<L>__{interior givings' living room day}
<A>__{mrs. givings crouches on a cotton work sheet painting varnish onto a chair. mr. givings sits reading the paper. a new puppy sleeps curled up on the rug nearby.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{i can't tell you how pleased i am about the little revolutionary road place, howard. remember how dreary it looked all winter? all cold and dark and well, spooky. creepy crawly. and now whenever i drive past, it gives me such a lift to see it all perked up and spanking clean again, with lights in the windows. and do you know, i was just thinking, i've loved that little house for years, and the braces are the first really suitable people i've ever found for it. really nice, congenial people, i mean.}
<A>__{mr. givings fiddles with his hearing aid.}
<C>__{mr. givings}
<D>__{well, except for the wheelers, you mean.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{oh, i was very fond of the wheelers but they always were a bit a bit whimsical, for my taste. a bit neurotic. i may not have stressed it, but they were often very trying people to deal with, in many ways.}
<C>__{mrs. givings }
<D>__{actually, the main reason the little house has been so hard to sell is that they let it depreciate so dreadfully. warped window frames, wet cellar, crayon marks on the walls, filthy smudges around all the }
<A>__{mr. givings reaches up to his ear and suddenly... silence... but for the faint sound of wind. he gazes out the window as behind him mrs. givings continues to talk, but we can't hear a thing. he has turned off his hearing aid.}
