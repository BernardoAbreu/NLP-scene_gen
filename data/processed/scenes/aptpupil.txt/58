<L>__{exterior high school day}
<A>__{todd is kneeling down at the bike rack. his backpack is on the ground next to him. he unlocks his bike and begins to coil the chain around his wrist when joey walks by. he sees todd and considers going by, but stops. we can tell they haven't spoken in a while.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{hey there.}
<A>__{todd looks up. he seems pleasant, but there is little warmth in his voice.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{pause. they look at each other. joey wants to talk. todd slips the chain lock into a pocket on his backpack. joey jingles his car keys anxiously.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i... ah, i heard about stanford. i heard a couple of weeks ago actually. ...congrats.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i got into school to. long beach. it's no stanford, but...}
<A>__{joey shrugs. it's an awkward moment. he walks closer.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no, no... that's good, joe.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{well, ...i just wanted to say hi. here let me get that.}
<A>__{joey reaches for todd's backpack. he lifts it. the heaviness puzzles him. todd takes it from him.}
<C>__{joey }
<D>__{what do you have in there?}
<A>__{todd stares at him stone faced. joey doesn't like todd's expression. todd takes the bag from him and puts it on.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you busy now?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{uhh...}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{come with me. hop on.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{hop on? i have a car now, todd.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you can't drive where we're going.}
