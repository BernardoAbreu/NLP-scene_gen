<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior walsh's office night}
<A>__{on walsh, in motion as he puts on a jacket, throws some papers into a briefcase. he's nervous, ill suited for this cloak and dagger stuff, chattering...}
<C>__{walsh}
<D>__{we'll be safe in my car. nobody will recognize it. let's move yours in back, no, down the block. hope it's nothing fancy. there's a chop shop around the corner.}
<A>__{she's looking elsewhere, at the door that has quietly opened. the captain stands there. somber reptile. holding a sheaf of papers in one hand.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{you followed me here.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{no... erin, i put out a bulletin on your car because... there's bad news. and i thought you should hear it from me.}
<A>__{she stares at him expressionless.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{your father got involved with some bad cops. on my force, so i take responsibility.}
<P>__{(beat, then)}
<D>__{he killed himself.}
<A>__{she talks with great difficulty.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{how did he kill himself?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{with a gun. is that what you mean?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{no. i mean... how did he kill himself how do you figure he killed himself with a gun, right when it wasn't anywhere near where you found him?}
<A>__{he takes a step toward her. she pulls out the blood pistol. seems crazy enough to use it.}
<C>__{erin }
<D>__{you killed him.}
<C>__{walsh}
<D>__{erin. don't.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{back the fuck off! now!}
<A>__{the captain stops, gently tosses the sheaf of papers toward her, onto walsh's desk. the papers nathan was preparing. walsh looks at them while...}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{he left this. names, addresses, a note to you. these people he was involved with killed lauren. he couldn't bear it anymore.}
<C>__{walsh}
<D>__{my god. he's right, it's all here.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{the note. show it to me.}
<A>__{erin has one eye on the papers now, recognizes her dad's hand. the captain inches forward.}
<C>__{erin }
<P>__{(to captain)}
<D>__{not you!}
<P>__{(to walsh)}
<D>__{show it to me.}
<A>__{the captain steps forward, right to the desk. erin backed into a corner now.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{it's right there, under that paper.}
<P>__{(grabs a note)}
<D>__{here. look.}
<A>__{she holds a hand out for the note, taking her eye off the situation for one second as she reads... the note a bunch of numbers added together in her father's hand. not a suicide note. the captain grabs erin's wrist and bam! a chunk of the ceiling falls as the weapon discharges. the captain throws her in a chokehold, her finger still on the trigger.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{you were always the stupid one.}
<A>__{she fights as the captain wraps his own hand over hers, wrestles her arm toward walsh, in the sights now. bam! walsh blown backward, collapsing by the chess board. trying to pull himself up. erin struggling. as... madden enters from the hall, in a hurry, gun drawn.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{you need help?}
<A>__{he nods toward walsh, who is moving, barely.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{hurry. we don't have much time.}
<A>__{bam. a shot from madden drops walsh for god. as madden drags walsh toward the door, the captain grabs... the picture of alex and lauren pulled off the lid of the chess box, one of the pieces of tape left behind. the captain exits.}
