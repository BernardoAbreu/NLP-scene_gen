<L>__{4. medium shot of eli's dark blue automobile, arriving.}
<A>__{eli emerges from the car. a bodyguard behind him, armed with an ak 47. he prepares to greet:}
<B>__{an arriving livery car.}
<A>__{out steps: a host of men in suits, grasping suitcases presumably filled with money. then another town car. and yet another. the men all congregate like it's a legal business transaction. handshakes, smiles. we pan around, moving through the weeds now. and we see: bobby and joseph, as they arrive, move into position. the camera moves laterally and we see: michael and jack and other cops, doing much the same. all carrying shotguns. one cop points a shotgun microphone at the activity, and our guys can hear perp conversations in their earpieces... another car arrives. appearing out of it is vadim nezhinski. joseph bristles at the sight of him. bobby grabs his brother's arm, squeezes:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{we're gonna get all of `em today.}
<A>__{just at that moment, a white van pulls up: two men get out. they open the back, filled with furs. they take a number of coats out of the back of the van, bring them to the shack... all the cops appear confused. what the hell is this? another town car. a crowd of people stand around the auto. helping someone out of the vehicle. whoever this is, he's the emperor... emerging: marat buzhayev. stepping up behind him, eli, helping king marat. marat and vadim greet each other. they kiss warmly. angle on bobby. a beat. we see the devastation. almost to himself:}
<C>__{bobby green }
<D>__{lookit the two of them...they're so fuckin' close...}
<A>__{then the cops spot: two young grandchildren, sitting in the back of the car. they do not get out. they seem clueless. standing guard over all of this is a lookout, who is armed with an ak 47. several other armed men take positions closer to the structure as the furs are brought in. businessmen make some banter, then enter the shack led by nezhinski. marat buzhayev and eli follow him in. many other men pour into the structure, briefcases in hand.}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{okay when they complete the sale, that's when we move. esu'll grab the kids.}
<A>__{a transaction begins inside the shack, and the cops are watching. they see the action through broken windows...}
