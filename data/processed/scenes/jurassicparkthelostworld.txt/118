<A>__{malcolm races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas station building, closing the door behind him. a moment later, a raptor bounds after him, slamming into the door. meeting resistance, it bounces off, notices the plate glass window next to the door, and pounces at that. the window shatters and the raptor clings to the ledge, staring inside, its tail hanging out. just as it gets inside, malcolm opens the door and comes back out, keeping the place of wall between them. he pulls the lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim but the raptor whirls and springs, forcing him back inside, through the door again. willing to play along, the raptor turns and jumps through the window again.}
