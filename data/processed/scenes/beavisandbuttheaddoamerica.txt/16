<D>__{yeah, it's not that important to me, really. those seats are too small anyways.}
<A>__{doloris yanks them out of their seats and leads them down the aisle. angle down aisle in coach. doloris stops by a row where an elderly woman, martha, sits by the window. next to her: two empty seats.}

<C>__{captain's voice }
<P>__{(through p.a.)}
<D>__{good morning. this is your captain speaking. welcome aboard flight 151 non stop to las vegas. we ask that you turn your attention to the front of the cabin for pre flight safety instructions.}
<A>__{b&b see doloris, stepping nearby to demonstrate the seat belt.}
<C>__{attendant's voice}
<D>__{to fasten your seat belt, insert the free end into the coupling. butt head insert. huh huh huh.}
<A>__{doloris demonstrates. b&b are dumbfounded. it's too complicated.}
<P>__{butt head (cont.)}

<A>__{they struggle to make their seat belts fit, getting each other's parts.}
<C>__{tammy }
<D>__{hi, i'm tammy? can i help you with that?}
<A>__{butt head looks up. from his p.o.v. we see a beautiful woman, tammy, smiling, her hands reaching down. falling in love harp music sting plays. close on butt head's lap as two female hands reach down and pull one strap from between butt head's legs. butt head looks down at his lap as tammy leans over him. a loud clicking can be heard. butt head stares blankly.}
<C>__{tammy }
<D>__{there you go. you're all set. butt head}
<P>__{(stunned)}

<A>__{suddenly martha buckles beavis' belt. tammy goes.}
<C>__{beavis}
<D>__{wait, i wanted her to do it. butt head huh huh. soon, she will be mine.}
<C>__{captain's voice}
<D>__{flight attendants, please prepare for take off.}
<A>__{the engines start to hum. the plane is rolling. butt head struggles to get his seat belt off. he does everything but pull the handle. beavis goes white with fear. the plane starts to shake. the engines rumble. beavis starts to freak.}
<C>__{beavis}
<D>__{hey wait a minute. what's going on?!}
<A>__{butt head bangs away at his seat belt. beavis looks out the window and realizes they're in the air.}
<C>__{beavis }
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{aaaagh! we're gonna die!!!!!}
<A>__{angle on couple in front of b&b:}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{d'ya hear that? something must be wrong!}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{oh my god!!!!!!!}
<A>__{angle on cabin, people start screaming. the plane quakes, lifting up. on butt head, furiously pulling:}
<D>__{butt head dammit! huh huh. that chick wants me.}
<C>__{beavis}
<D>__{aggghg! we're gonna die! we're all gonna die!}
<A>__{the plane arcs upward. butt head finally gets the belt off as the plane is in full thrust. he rises and goes tumbling backward down the aisle. on people seeing butt head flying, screaming in panic. in free fall: butt head grabs the door to the hangable luggage. it all comes tearing out. butt head flies up, hitting several overhead luggage racks, which open and spill their contents. butt head lands in the galley, causing food to go flying and coffee to pour freely. on the cabin as the plane starts to level out. people stop their screaming. on butt head, underneath the rubble, poking his head out. he's directly across from the flight attendant station where tammy is strapped in.}
<D>__{butt head uh, huh huh... could you, like, do that thing with my belt again?}
