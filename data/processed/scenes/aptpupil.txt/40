<L>__{exterior dussander's back porch day}
<A>__{dussander still wears the blue suit. the tie has been loosened and top button undone. todd still wears his backpack.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you what?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i told him you were getting back on track by your own accord. i gave him my word. if you get even one flunk card }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{are you out of your fucking mind? i'm going to get three or four flunk cards. i failed an economics test today, so there's another one.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{boy, it was the best i could do without arousing suspicion.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i could have done better myself }
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{well you didn't, did you? this is the way it is and now you are upset because the only way you can make things right is to work.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you're insane. i'm upset because it can't be done.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{it can. and it will. you will work.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i don't take orders from you. maybe you've forgotten }
<C>__{dussander}
<P>__{(turning on him)}
<D>__{listen, boy. before today it was possible, just barely possible, that you could have denounced me and come out clean yourself. the way your nerves have been lately i don't think so, but never mind that. it was at least technically possible. but now things have changed. today i impersonated your grandfather, one victor bowden. and it was you who arranged the meeting. what would people make of that? if things come out now... perhaps you were right, your age and a good attorney might keep you out of jail, but you would be humiliated, boy, publicly. you would be infamous. your parents too. do you know what such a scandal would do to them? to you? think about that.}
<A>__{todd is stunned. he turns away, then back again, struggling for the right words.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you fucker.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{it's a done deal, boy. if you don't like it, you can discuss it at family counselling.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{god! i wish... i wish }
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{never mind your wishes. your wishes make me sick. all i want to hear is that you understand the situation.}
<A>__{todd is furious. he sees there is no other way, but continues fighting.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{look, you gotta believe me. there is no way in hell that i can pull myself out of a half year slide in a couple of weeks. i wish i could, but we're just going to have to think of something else.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{boy, the time for discussion is over. this is the way it is. you are going to work. and i am going to be right here with you.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
