<A>__{white rushes down a dark hall lined with bronze statues. he finds section c then walks between towering rows stacked with old volumes. comes to number 7. he follows an arrow past row after row finally finds row 34 but then it skips straight to letters again, a, b, c, etc. no row 35. he stops and looks around sure enough a door displays a small sign: toilets. white is sweating profusely. he now sits on a chair, takes off his shoes, rubs his feet. he pulls a book from a shelf behind him, looks about, opens the book and tears several pages out, folds them, stuffs them into his shoes to plug up the holes. he gets up, tries to backtrack, comes across an elaborate diagram of the library interior. an arrow points to a section near a wing labelled: maps. near the arrow it says: you are}
<B>__{here.}
<A>__{he keeps walking. he finds the door to the maps wing but the door is locked, a sign is nailed to it: we are remodelling. we apologize for any}
<B>__{inconvenience.}
<A>__{white, annoyed now, tries to force his way in. puts his shoulder to the door, pushes several times. it crumbles under his weight rotten. he finds himself in a dusty room.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{a narrow room, filled with rows of bookshelves with stacks of old newspapers. tight on white he steps forward, pulls a folded newspaper off the shelf. the instant he picks it up, it crumbles to dust in his hands. he picks up another, and another, each in turn breaking apart and dissolving to nothingness.}
