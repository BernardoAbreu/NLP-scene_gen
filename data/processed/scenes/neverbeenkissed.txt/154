<L>__{interior country club continuous}
<A>__{we pan across the dance floor where we see popeye & olive oyl, sonny & cher, the blues brothers. we hold on robin dancing with batgirl. batman approached and taps robin's shoulder }
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{may i have this dance }
<A>__{and batgirl steps aside robin and batman dance happily away.}
<B>__{angle on rob trying to slow dance with tracy}
<A>__{(dressed like rebecca de mornay), but she is so drunk she's having trouble balancing.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{are you having fun?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yeah. definitely.}
<A>__{he tries to stand her up on her own.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{good. gibby gave me champagne.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{maybe we should sit.}
<A>__{he helps her to a chair next to the dance floor. they both sit. next to them, a ravenous miss piggy eats with her date kermit looking on. she picks up an hors d'oeuvre and stares at it horrified.}
<C>__{miss piggy}
<D>__{oh my god! is this a pig in a blanket?!}
<A>__{tracy looks at rob, and gets serious.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{rob, i've i've thought about it a lot. and i think i mean, i know. you're the one. my penguin.}
<A>__{rob looks at her. she's young. she's beautiful. she's tipsy. she's trying to put her legs behind her head.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{wow i }
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{rob, i mean it. i want you to be my first. me and you. once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.}
<A>__{he looks around. it's high school prom. a skinny kid is getting beat up in a corner. other kids are sneaking smokes. he can't do this.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i'm gonna get you some water. and then, i think we should get back out on that dance floor and boogie.}
<A>__{rob gets up, kisses tracy on the top of her head, and heads for the refreshment table. tracy, her leg still around her head falls backwards into kermit's lap. kermit looks down, surprised and interested. miss piggy notices, gives him a big "harumph", tosses her hair, and leaves. angle back on: the cool table. gibby is staring o.s. in horror.}
<C>__{gibby}
<D>__{you guys what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{that you would trip on your barbie heels and i'd get named prom queen?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{did i say that out loud?}
<A>__{we follow kristen's stare to the prom entrance where aldys and the denominators enter in pairs, one behind the other, attached together with rope, to form a human ladder. they cross the dance floor, interrupting everything with their unwieldy, tied together conga line. they approach the cool table.}
<C>__{gibby}
<D>__{so what are you supposed to be? other than freaks?}
<C>__{aldys}
<D>__{we're dna. a double helix. but i guess you'd know that if you'd actually passed bio.}
<A>__{kristen reaches out and touches the rope binding denominator #1 to aldys. denominator #1 slaps her hand away.}
<D>__{denominator #1 please don't touch the hydrogen. it's rented.}
<A>__{kristen reacts.}
