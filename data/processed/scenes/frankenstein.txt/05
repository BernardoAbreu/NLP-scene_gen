<L>__{ext nevsky low angle from ice twilight}
<A>__{walton watches them reel the body in. angle shifts as he turns, revealing the rest of the crew working desperately to free the ship. axes and picks rise and fall in waves, slamming into the ice, throwing up frozen chips. the men are near collapse, exhaustion carved in their faces. the dogs are nearby, huskies and malamutes huddled in the snow. walton rejoins the men, rams his axe fiercely into the ice.}

<D>__{put your backs into it! sailor #1 what's the use? this godless ice stretches for miles! would you have us chow our way back to england?}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{no. but we'll chop our way to the north pole if we have to. inch by bloody inch.}
<C>__{grigori}
<D>__{you can't mean to go on! our journey is ended! the best we can hope for now is to get out of this alive! sailor #2 aye, if the ice ever lets us!}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{the ice will break. and when it does, we proceed north... as planned.}
<A>__{cries of dismay from the men. grigori thrusts his arm toward the sky, pointing at the corpse on the mast.}
<C>__{grigori}
<D>__{at the cost of how many more lives?}
<A>__{he's interrupted by a long, chilling howl. the lead husky rises to its feet, hackles up, howling at some unseen thing in the distance. the other dogs start rising around him, joining in, staring off across the ice.}
<C>__{grigori}
<D>__{there's something out there.}
<A>__{the dogs are going berserk. the lead husky breaks free and launches himself across the ice. the men scramble to restrain the animals, but three more break away and take off after their leader. walton snatches up his rifle.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{you five come with me! the rest stay with the ship!}
