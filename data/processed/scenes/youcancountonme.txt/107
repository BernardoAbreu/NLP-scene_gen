<L>__{exterior porch. night}
<A>__{sammy and terry stand side by side on the porch, passing a joint back and forth. it has stopped raining but the trees and roof are still dripping. the crickets are chirping loudly.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{so... bob asked me to marry him.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{wow.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{are you going to?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i don't know. if he'd've asked me this time last year i would have probably said yes. but the minute he said it, i don't know, i felt like somebody was trying to strangle me.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{well... bad sign.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{plus, terry...}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i fucked my boss...!}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i know! and his wife is six months pregnant.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{jesus christ, sammy...!}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i know, i know.}
<A>__{he passes her the jointerior she declines. he puffs away. the water drips off the porch and the crickets chirp. she puts her head on his shoulder. he puts one arm around her and puffs away with the joint in his free hand.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{terry, i'm sorry i got so mad before. i just don't want him, you know terrified of "telling," if there's }
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{uh, well, that's not really his problem, sammy.}
<A>__{sammy straightens up.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{oh really? what's his problem?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{his problem is that he's like totally sheltered because you treat him like he's three, instead of eight, so that's how he behaves.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{oh yeah? and how do you think he should behave?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i think he shouldn't have to run and tell his mommy every time he does something she might not like, for one thing.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{uh huh. and what do you }
<C>__{terry}
<P>__{(on "and")}
<D>__{i mean i took him to play pool! it was a little clandestine thing we did for fun! it wasn't like a big secret, i mean who cares? i was actually trying to be nice to him. but he's so freaked out that he disobeyed your orders that he has to fuckin' squeal on me and i have to listen to your fuckin' shit all day when i didn't even fuckin' do anything!}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{first of all, he didn't tell me anything: darryl did. ok? second of all, i don't really give a shit if you took him to play pool: i was mad at you because you left him standing at the bus stop in the rain. but no, i don't want you telling him not to squeal, because i don't want him put in that position!}
<C>__{terry}
<P>__{(losing ground)}
<D>__{well... that... is a perfect example of what i'm talking about.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{you are in idiot.}
<A>__{they stand apart now. silence.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{darryl told you?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{they stand there. the rain gutters drip.}
