<L>__{exterior beach sunset}
<A>__{the same sunset, but from another time. four young men walk along a deserted beach. a small boat has beached and rocks gently in the shallows. the boys run up and look at it. on the stern are painted the words: brigantine}
<B>__{albatross.}
<A>__{slowly pull back to reveal endless white sand, blue water, the young men and the boat.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{some time later we learned that one of our long boats had been recovered. several young men found it washed up on a nameless beach somewhere on the island of hispaniola. no one seemed to know who they were or where they came from, but they seemed to know of the albatross.}

<D>__{sometimes in my dreams those faceless young men reveal themselves as my lost companions, and on the twilight coral sands of forever, between my slumber and conscious state, we race naked again, so open and in love with those precious moments, running, ever laughing, ever young, ever free.}
