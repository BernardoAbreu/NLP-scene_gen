<L>__{exterior beatrix's house balcony evening}
<A>__{fernando is sitting in front of his father, examining documents and letters. columbus has wrapped a shawl around his legs. he looks even older now, with his mass of pure white hair. beatrix comes out with a tray, carrying grapes and a decanter of water. she places it on a small table near columbus and touches his shoulder. as she is ready to return inside the house, he holds her back.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{can't you stay with us a little?}
<C>__{beatrix}
<D>__{i am busy inside.}
<A>__{he smiles. she looks at him smiling, intrigued.}
<C>__{beatrix}
<D>__{what is it, now? tell me...}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{i can't keep my eyes off you. i would like to catch up with all the moments i didn't spend with you.}
<A>__{fernando looks up at them above his letters, amused and slightly embarrassed. columbus looks at him with a fake air of reproach.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{what are you listening to?}
<C>__{fernando}
<D>__{i am not listening, father. but i can't help hearing.}
<A>__{fernando opens a letter and reads it quickly.}
<C>__{fernando}
<D>__{it's diego... he is at the court, with santangel... he says they hope to get your privileges restored... and maybe the house.}
<A>__{columbus smiles and nods all this seems to be of very little importance to him now.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{but how is he? and dona maria?}
<A>__{fernando continues to read.}
<C>__{fernando}
<D>__{fine, it seems. diego is thinking of starting a pearl trade, in santo domingo... he says he received many letters for you. some of your men, mostly.}
<A>__{he opens one of them, glances at it.}
<C>__{fernando}
<D>__{this one is from mendez!}
<A>__{columbus' eyes brighten with joy.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{what does he say?}
<C>__{fernando}
<D>__{he asks when he can come to visit you. he left his address.}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{he never had one... except aboard my ships!}
<A>__{fernando laughs then, suddenly serious.}
<C>__{fernando}
<D>__{i want you to tell me everything you remember, father. from the beginning. everything.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{really?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{god... i wouldn't know where to start... and yet...}
<C>__{fernando}
<D>__{tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.}
<A>__{columbus sighs, and leans back on his chair. his eyes are fixed somewhere, searching. then, almost in a murmur.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{i remember...}
<A>__{we see the page. fernando writes: ... i remember... a drop of ink falls from the quill onto the page and the words. fernando is waiting.}
