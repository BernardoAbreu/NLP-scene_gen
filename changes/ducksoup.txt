<ACTION>__{The story begins with an opening shot on the exterior of the executive mansion.  It is a gala day.  Soldiers are lined up in front of the entrance; expensive cars and carriages are arriving and depositing distinguished notables from the adjoining countries.  Two trumpeters at the head of the stairs announce the arrival of each notable. In the large reception hall, Mrs. Teasdale, wife of the late president, is greeting the newcomers.  The room is filled with distinguished guests.  At the moment we see Mrs. Teasdale, she is talking with a notable.  In the near background is a group of distinguished men, members of her own cabinet.  Her words to the notable are not lost on them, and as she begins to praise the new dictator, there is the exchange of disapproving glances.}

He hurries over to one corner of the room where his clothes are arranged in fireman fashion, gets into them, and then sides down a fireman's pole into the reception hall. The guests are singing the last two lines of the national anthem when he arrives.}
