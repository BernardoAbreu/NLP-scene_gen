<A>__{jack's apartment is small, old, and comfortably cluttered. the most striking item is a vintage phone booth placed against the wall. as jack lets himself in, eddie, the dog from the window, walks over. he is not an overly enthusiastic dog, but you can see from his face that he has a great deal of affection for jack.}

<D>__{take it easy, will ya? you're becoming a regular johhny appleseed the way you're dropping teeth around here.}
<A>__{jack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over to an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs. he lifts the records back up the post and clicks on the machine. as bill evans' smoky "peace piece" fills the tiny apartment, jack breaks the collar of his shirt and walks over to the old piano near the window. settling back with the bottle of whiskey, jack rests his elbows gently on the keys and stares out the open window, listening to the music.}
