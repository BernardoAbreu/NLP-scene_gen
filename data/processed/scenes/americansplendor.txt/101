<A>__{joyce sits on her equally disheveled bed dunking a tea bag. her hair is wet from a shower.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{i don't know. where would i stay?}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{with me. don't worry, i'm not gonna put no moves on you or anything.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{i'm not worried about that...}
<P>__{(fumbling with a tea cup)}
<D>__{hold on, i just spilled chamomile tea all over my bathrobe.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{so what are ya worried about then?}
<A>__{joyce sighs and lies down. a variety of american splendors are across her bed. different interpretations of harvey stare up at her.}
<C>__{joyce}
<P>__{(sipping)}
<D>__{well, the way all those different artists draw you, i don't quite know what to expect. i mean sometimes you look like a younger brando, but then the way crumb draws you like a hairy ape with all those stinky, wavy lines radiating off your body it's kind of scary.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{those are motion lines. i'm an active guy. anyway, just come out here an' i will try to be anyone you want me ta be.}
<A>__{joyce smiles for the first time.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{that's a dangerous offer. i'm a notorious reformer...}
