<L>__{interior night new jersey house}
<A>__{compared to the gloom of the basement in the department store, the second floor of the house seems to be bathed in light. michael is sitting quietly in front of his room. as narcissus did, he is observing his reflection, mirrored in the surface of the water that covers the wooden floor.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{michael ?}
<A>__{hypnotized by his mirror image, the little boy does not hear his mother's call. amy appears at the top of the stairs and catches sight of him.}
<C>__{amy }
<D>__{michael... michael, look at me... i'm right here.}
<A>__{michael doesn't answer. gently, he caresses his reflection in the surface of the water. amy comes up to him slowly, determined to pull him away from his reflection... she lays her hand on his shoulder. this time michael reacts and turns towards her. before he can utter a single word the reflection of the hand becomes real, grabbing the child's wrists. michael's reflection pulls him through its surface.}
<B>__{michael disappears into the floor.}
<A>__{amy throws herself to the ground in an attempt to catch him. too late, the little boy has been submerged in the thin layer of water covering the floor. michael has been pulled into the other side of the mirror! amy sees her son struggling under the water, as if he were caught under a coat of ice.}
<C>__{amy }
<D>__{michael, michael... no, no...}
<A>__{in desperation, amy beats her fists against the floor with all her strength, trying to break through to the other side.}
<C>__{amy }
<D>__{michael !! nooooo...}
<A>__{flying into a rage, she beats her fists again and again in an attempt to break the surface and save michael from drowning. she sees michael's body sinking into the depths...}
