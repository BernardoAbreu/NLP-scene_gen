<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{the ocean}
<A>__{as seen looking over the rail of the pier. the tide is in, but it's still a forty foot drop. ryan stares over the railing like a death row inmate contemplating his last meal.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{go already. no one's looking.}
<A>__{his left hand holds his wallet.}
<C>__{chad }
<P>__{(re: wallet)}
<D>__{need me to hold that?}
<A>__{ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts he zips a zipper, tucks a velcro flap. pats his pocket proudly.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{waterproof.}
<A>__{but as soon as ryan covertly climbs onto the rail, his left leg starts trembling like crazy.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{this is stupid. i could get killed. pick another dare.}
<A>__{chad lowers the phone, irritated.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{my ass. not after you made me march in the gay pride parade wearing a thong.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{screw it then. in one... two... two and a half }
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{whole numbers only, rabbitfoot.}
<A>__{ryan stares at the waves crashing below. his leg starts snaking like crazy... and he chickens out, hopping back to the deck.}
<C>__{chad }
<D>__{just so you know, i'm emailing this to every chick you ever met.}
<A>__{but suddenly ryan's oblivious to the dare. his eyes are glued to something else }
<C>__{chad }
<P>__{(speaking like hal 900)}
<D>__{transmitting pussy file now.}
<A>__{chloe, early 20s, a head turner, confident, funny; she can pull you in like a tractor beam. she and some cute friends carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the "heal the bay" rally. ryan walks over like he owns the place.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{got any more? i'm here to help.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{thanks, but no, we got 'em all.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{what's in 'em?}
<A>__{chloe opens the box. hands him a "heal the bay" pamphlet.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{cool, you're handing these out during the concert?}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{yeah, wanna help?}
<A>__{ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{hell yeah. i'm all about "heal the bay. "}
<A>__{his eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{me an chad do the monthly cleanup thing, of course...}
<A>__{an awesome wing man, chad appears over chloe's shoulder, pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so ryan can see it. piece of cake, now.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{we've collected water samples with the stream team, raised money on the promenade... i'm surprised i haven't seen you.}
<A>__{he offers his hand.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{ryan.}
<A>__{she takes it.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{chloe.}
<A>__{the handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and they both smile at each other. chad splits.}
<C>__{chloe }
<D>__{i can't tell if you're full of it.}
<A>__{ryan stops posturing, gets real.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{you ever go up to santa barbara? my dad used to take me there all}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{the time. their pier is amazing, clear water, huge crabs everywhere, oysters right there on the rocks, starfish... hard to believe it's the same ocean sometimes.}
<A>__{he's managed to win her back.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{maybe you and i can take a break later when pat benatar goes on.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{sounds like a plan.}
<A>__{there's a moment... then }
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{oh no i forgot. i still have to pick up a box of t shirts at the kinkos on venice.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i will do it for you... if you want.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{seriously, you would?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{sure. how much is the bill?}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{nothing. it's been paid up front.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{do you promise not to go anywhere?}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{done.}
<A>__{ryan makes a graceful exit. turns back.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{okay, i won't be long.}
<C>__{chloe}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{ryan grabs chad, and as they walk out of earshot:}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{dude, does santa barbara have a harbor or a pier?}
