<L>__{interior hotel suite}
<A>__{the party is taking off. the all girl band is going ape shit. the guys are dancing with the hookers. they're all moving in unison, to a gyrating new wave dance step and singing along with the music. angle ryko he's wearing gravity boots, hanging upside down, entwined around one of the hookers. they're hanging there, making out like crazy. gary passes by.}
<C>__{ryko}
<D>__{hey, gary, spot me.}
<A>__{angle bedroom door stan comes out of the bedroom. he's disheveled, but looks very happy. he crosses to rick.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{thanks a lot, that was the best. you're nexterior}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{nah, not yet. look, you're my older brother. i need some advice here. what's the deal with marriage? what can i expect?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{well, the first month it's great. the second month things calm down a little. by the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{thanks, stan, you've been a lot of help.}
<A>__{stan pats rick on the back and dives into the festivities. angle gary he spots someone across the room. it's like tony spotting maria for the first time in "west side story." as in a dream sequence, all sounds stop. two pinspots hit them. she turns and sees him. she smiles. both are madly in love. like two pieces of metal attracted to the same magnet, they walk toward each other.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{she}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{they take each other by the hand. they walk into the bedroom and close the door behind them. the new wave dance briefly continues, then comes to an end. another angle the hotel room o'neill grabs ryko (who is just coming down from his gravity bar) and stan, who is wearing a pair of women's underwear on his head.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{you guys better get going. it's getting late.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{oh, right.}
<A>__{ryko and stan cross to the door and exit. as they do, four or five pretty girls are passing by in the hallway.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{is there a party going on in there or something?}
<C>__{ryko}
<D>__{yeah. it's great. go on in.}
<A>__{the girls cross inside.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{my god. fresh meat. let's hurry back.}
