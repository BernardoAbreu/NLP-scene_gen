<A>__{nicholas andre is greeting people at the door. however, when harry and lloyd try to enter, he stops them and gives them the once over.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a five hundred dollar a plate dinner.}
<A>__{harry and lloyd look at each other and shrug. then lloyd takes out a wad of bills and peels off ten hundreds, much to the amazement of andre.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{this should cover a couple plates.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm kind of hungry, lloyd. what if we want seconds?}
<A>__{lloyd thinks about this. then he peels off another thou.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{put us down for four plates, my good man.}
<A>__{they enter the party. as andre watches them go, his associate j.p. shay comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face.}
<C>__{j.p. shay}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{jesus christ, boss... it's them.}
<A>__{back on harry and lloyd the guys make their way through the affluent crowd.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i'm getting nervous, harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{relax, lloyd. these people are just like you and me.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{what are you talking about? they're educated, well bred, charming, and sophisticated.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so what? we can be sophistica holy shit, would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound.}
<A>__{he points out a busty blonde bombshell entering the party. lloyd rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{don't do this to me, harry. i'm already a wreck. what if mary oesn't like me?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{look, let's just go saddle up to the bar and down a couple bowls of loudmouth soup. a little booze'll bring back that old lloyd christmas over confidence.}
<A>__{the guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they make their way to the bar.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(to bartender)}
<D>__{two martinis, straight up.}
<A>__{as harry and lloyd silently take in the party, a beautiful red head reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then walks away.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<D>__{shut up, harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i didn't say anything.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{yeah, well i know what you were gonna say and i'm telling you to shut up in advance.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{how do you know what i was gonna say?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i read you like a book.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{okay, if you read me like a book then what was i gonna say?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you were gonna say:}
<P>__{(in harry's looped voice)}
<D>__{'that's one fiery bush i wouldn't mind roasting my weenie in.'}
<A>__{harry raises his eyebrows, impressed.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<D>__{and i would say 'shut up', because this is our chance to get in with the rich and powerful and you don't ingratiate yourself to the kind of people by acting like ron jeremy on spanish fly.}
<A>__{the bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s. clinking of a glass. the guys turns to see nicholas andre standing at a podium. next to him is a large, covered display. on his other side are karl and elizabeth swanson.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{if i could have your attention, please...}
<A>__{the crowd quiets.}
<C>__{andre }
<D>__{i'd like to thank you all for coming to this very special event. as you}
<A>__{know, the aspen preservation society founded and chiefly funded by our great benefactors, karl and helen swanson is the world's foremost efender of endangered species. our sprawling grounds are home to twenty three separate varieties of animals that are currently listed on the united nation's charter of protected species. tonight, we are deeply honored to have mr. karl swanson welcome our twenty fourth. the crowd claps as mr. swanson takes andre's place at the podium.}
<C>__{mr. swanson}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, i give you the icelandic snow owl.}
<A>__{he pulls the cover off, revealing two majestic, fluffy white owls in a cage. everyone oohs and ahhs.}
<C>__{mr. swanson }
<D>__{these magnificent specimens were}
<A>__{rescued recently, culminating a five year, two million dollar effort on our part. together, they constitute one seventh of the snow owl population left on the planet. on andre he's nervously eyeing harry and lloyd. he looks pale.}
<C>__{mr. swanson}
<D>__{here these lovely birds will be allowed to breed in a natural but protected habitat. and, god willing, with your help and that of the society's, we will see these wonderful creatures flourish once more.}
<A>__{more applause.}
<C>__{mr. swanson }
<D>__{again, thank you, and enjoy your evening. oh, and feel free to take a closer look at our new friends here. enjoy.}
<A>__{the crowd applauds and begins to mingle again. lloyd turns back to the bartender and holds up his empty glass.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{two more, please.}
<A>__{harry stares at lloyd with concern.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{lloyd, i've never seen you this uptight. you've gotta chill out.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i can't help it. this is a very important night for me.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{harry, have you ever wondered why you and i never have long term girlfriends?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what are you talking about? i went out with fraida felcher for two and a half weeks.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{that was a fluke.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the reason we never have long term girlfriends is because of one thing: we're afraid of the c word.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's crazy. we live for the c word.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i'm talking bout commitment.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{well i'm ready for commitment, harry. the first time i laid eyes on mary swanson, i knew she was the one.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{some things you feel in your heart, other things you feel in your groin. this girl makes me feel it all in the heart.}
<A>__{suddenly lloyd notices something across the room. his pov a beguiling mary swanson is talking with a couple of guests. she's wearing a spectacular black cocktail dress. lloyd quickly turns toward the bar.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<D>__{oh shit, there she is.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(checking her out)}
<D>__{wow. you weren't kidding, lloyd. she's an angel.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, what are you waiting for? get over there and talk to her.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{she's gonna think i'm some kind of psycho when she realizes how far i came just to see her.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you have her briefcase she's gonna be thrilled to see you.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{and then what? she'll take it back and that'll be it. i'm a nobody.}
<A>__{harry thinks about this a moment.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{look, man, you just drove two thousand miles to see this girl. don't quit on the last fifty feet.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(brightening)}
<D>__{wait a second, i have an idea. you go over and introduce yourself. that way you can build me up so when i come along i won't have to brag about myself. tell her i'm good looking and i'm rich and i have a rapist's wit.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i can't tell her you're good looking, lloyd she's got eyes.}
<A>__{lloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{please harry, i'm appealing to you as one loser to another. just build me up and then give me a signal to come over. please.}
<A>__{harry sighs.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{all right. but you're gonna owe me a big one for this.}
<A>__{harry straightens his polka dot bow tie, then approaches mary, who is now standing alone, admiring the owls.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{nice set of hooters you got there.}
<A>__{mary turns to harry, stunned.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{the owls. they're beautiful.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{oh. yeah.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you a bird lover?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, i used to have a parakeet, but my main area of expertise is canines that's dogs to the layperson.}
<A>__{she smiles at this.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{thanks. i love dogs, too. so how}
<A>__{are you involved with them?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, i've trained them, bathed them, clipped them; i've even bred them.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{really? any unusual breeding?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{nah, mostly just doggie style. but one time we successfully mated a bulldog and a shitzu.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{really? that's weird.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah. we called it a bullshit.}
<P>__{(breaks out laughing)}
<D>__{just a little breeder joke.}
<A>__{she seems strangely charmed by this.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{anyway, the real reason i came over is because i want to introduce you to a friend of mine.}
<A>__{just then, mary's stepmother approaches. she's holding a martini and looking a little sloshed.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{mary, i don't believe i've met your friend.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{actually, we haven't been introduced yet.}
<P>__{(holds out hand)}
<D>__{i'm mary swanson, and this is my stepmother, helen.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{harry dunne. pleasure meeting you both.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i saw you come in earlier, mr. dunne. i was hoping we'd get a chance to meet.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{you were?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that tuxedo i love a man with a sense of humor. so does mary.}
<A>__{mary shoots helen a look, then smiles at harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{for a moment, he's caught up in mary's eyes, but then manages to snap out of it.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{anyway, about my friend you doing anything tomorrow, mr. dunne? because i believe mary's looking for somebody to hit the slopes with. whuh?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{helen, you're embarrassing me.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{well you are, aren't you?}
<P>__{(to harry)}
<D>__{poor girl doesn't get out enough. so what do you say, harry? are you available?}
<A>__{harry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a hopeful lloyd.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, i don't know. you see, my friend your friends for one day. you and mary will have a ball.}
<A>__{mary's captivating eyes meet his, waiting for an answer.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{um... well... i don't know. you see, the thing is... sure.}
<A>__{on lloyd he waits impatiently at the bar as harry returns.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{how come you didn't call me over?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{relax, you're golden. i got you a ate with her tomorrow.}
<A>__{lloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest. he's}
<B>__{speechless.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{wha... you... i... it's...}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i love you, man. i love you!}
<A>__{lloyd clamps an embarrassed harry in a tight embrace.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{okay, get a grip, lloyd. you're making a scene.}
<A>__{lloyd steps back elated.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{this calls for a toast!}
<A>__{he grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to open it.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<D>__{you're gonna be my best man, har, i mean it. it was always between you and my future wife's brother, but you just earned a seat at the head table, pal.}
<A>__{suddenly the cork shoots out of the champagne bottle and}
<B>__{zips across the room like a bullet directly toward one of the now even}
<A>__{wider eyed owls. in quick succession we hear a bok!, a squawk!, and a thump! a hush falls over the entire party as everyone turns their stunned attention to the cage. their pov feathers are floating in the air throughout the cage, and one of the icelandic snow owls lies on its back, its species now one bird closer to extinction. harry and lloyd look on in horror. harry takes the smoking champagne bottle from lloyd and places it on the bar.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(under breath)}
<D>__{i think we've done enough hobnobbing, lloyd.}
<A>__{the guys lower their heads and slink out of the room before anyone can figure out what happened anyone except for nicholas andre, that is; we pan to show that he's been standing nearby watching their every move. and he doesn't look very happy.}
