<A>__{colin gray drives down the street in a big old boat of a classic car. he's blasting punk music on an ipod that's been rigged to the ancient am radio. colin holds up his cell phone to re read the directions jennifer texted him. the street is extremely dark and silent, occupied only by a new townhouse development. the identical units still appear to be under construction. there aren't even any streetlights. the plastic sheeting over the windows flaps eerily in the breeze. colin's brow furrows in confusion it doesn't even look like anyone lives here yet. he checks the phone display again.}
