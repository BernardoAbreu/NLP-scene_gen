<A>__{jeff is spread eagled on the ground. sheriff boyd calls out to earl in the cab. he keeps his gun leveled.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{you there in the pickup! you all right? can you get out?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{yeah! just don't shoot me, officer! he's crazy, i tell you!}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{well, get out dammit!}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{officer, please. you gotta listen to me }
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<P>__{(glances down at jeff)}
<D>__{shut up.}
<P>__{(to earl)}
<D>__{c'mon out, sir. it's safe }
<A>__{earl sets one foot on the road. the headrest dangles against his back, still taped to his neck. suddenly earl whirls, holding a .22 snub nose revolver and fires! the sheriff stumbles away, blood spurting from his shoulder, the gun flying from his hand. jeff looks up in horror as the sheriff falls. earl comes around the pickup after jeff, raising the gun to fire. jeff scrambles to his feet and dives down the embankment. earl runs to the edge of the embankment. down below, jeff is reaching for the automatic pistol the sheriff ordered him to drop. he finds it... too late... earl is aiming at point blank range from the top of the embankment. he is already squeezing the trigger when... blam! earl's chest erupts outward as a bullet passes through his body from behind! earl staggers and flops down the embankment. he comes to rest near jeff, blood gurgling from a massive chest wound. jeff climbs the embankment. the sheriff is lying on the road, critically injured, gun lying nearby and still smoking from the shot that killed earl. the sheriff is struggling to speak into a remote transmitter strapped to his uniform.}

<D>__{shots fired... officer down... suspect...}
<C>__{dispatcher }
<D>__{help is on the way, sheriff. just hang on. i have units and an ambulance en route.}
<A>__{jeff bends over the sheriff and examines his wound with a grimace. he is verging on unconsciousness. jeff deliberates, torn. there is nothing he can do here. making up his mind, jeff runs to the pickup. the hand held cellular phone has spilled into the road. he scoops it up, jumps behind the wheel and lays rubber.}
