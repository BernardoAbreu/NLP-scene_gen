<A>__{later, sommerfield and hedges consult with blade and abigail.}
<C>__{hedges}
<D>__{so basically we're in an arms race. they're using drake's dna to build themselves a better vampire }
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(noddin)}
<D>__{ and we need his blood to kill them.}
<P>__{(to sommerfield)}
<D>__{how's this weapon of yours coming along?}
<C>__{sodderfield}
<D>__{we're almost there }
<A>__{she gestures to a series of ampule like prototypes. (we'll see the completed version of this device later on.)}
<C>__{sommerfield}
<D>__{the virus is harmless to humans. so we decided to go after the vampires' food source. the one thing we know for sure about vampires is that they have to drink blood. if we manage to pull this off, we'll be able to contaminate every blood source on the planet. they won't have anyone left to feed on.}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{doesn't do us any good if we don't have time to finish it. we can't just sit here. we need to take the battle to them.}
<A>__{sommerfield lowers her head, thinking.}
<C>__{sommerfield}
<D>__{if the vampires are trying to isolate the hereditary factor in drake that makes him immune to sunlight, they'll require certain kinds of laboratory equipment and provisions. for instance, there's an enzyme called taq polymerase. and there are only a limited number of suppliers.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{give me a few hours. i will see if i can't hunt us up some leads.}
