<A>__{the city is dead. empty. desolate. buildings hang down out of black. day time was never invented. as he puts the wallet back in his pocket, a business card he hadnit noticed, flutters to the ground. he stops, picks it up. in simple print: doctor d.p. schreber m.d., a phone number. scribbled handwriting on the back says: thursday 0930. on white he glances across the street. his p.o.v. a cafe. a broken neon fish buzzes above the doorway.}
