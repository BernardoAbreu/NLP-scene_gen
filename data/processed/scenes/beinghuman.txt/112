<L>__{exterior clearing day}
<A>__{the meeting of the two leaders is weird and wonderful to see. the ragged europeans, already scanning the baskets of the natives for signs of solid food, somehow still muster an absurd sense of their own importance for the occasion. the natives, excited and curious, trying to contain their exuberance so that they don't miss a single detail of this most significant day. many of the natives have climbed into the trees, either out of timidity or to get a better view the trees around the meeting place are dripping with bodies, like human fruit. hector slips into the crowd as the native king is in mid speech. when he has stopped talking the slave begins to haltingly translate.}
<C>__{slave}
<D>__{he was excited when he heard you had come, but he wants to know if you are real people... he didn't think you would be such a strange color... so he wants to see your...}
<A>__{he points repeatedly at his navel.}
<C>__{slave}
<D>__{... so that he will know that you were born like real people...}
<A>__{dom paulo won't suffer the indignity alone. he talks to the officers standing closest to him.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{right... you four as well...}
<A>__{he begins to open up his coat and shirt. the four officers do the same. the king and a few of his atten dants take a step or two forward and peer at the exposed white european bellies. they look at one another and mumble solemnly. then they step back. dom paulo and the officers fix their clothing and re muster their dignity. the king is enjoying himself. he speaks again to the slave, who then translates.}
<C>__{slave}
<D>__{he wants to see you breathe.}
<A>__{the king takes a deep breath, then nods to dom paulo. dom paulo and the officers do as they are told. the king joins them, and for a few moments there is a kind of communion between them. then everyone joins in. it is a strange, poignant moment, all the natives and all the europeans united in the simple act of breathing. dom paulo regains his composure. he speaks to the slave.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{tell him that we want to trade with him, to buy food... and we want him to guide us out of here... we have a long way to travel... to where the white men have their big ships...}
<A>__{the slave speaks to the king. the king listens and talks back for a long time. then the slave translates again.}
<C>__{slave}
<D>__{he has heard of white men very, very far away... this way... but you have to cross many rivers... twenty big rivers...}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{tell him i want to give him these...}
<A>__{dom paulo steps forward to the king. an officer brings a wrapped cloth. dom paulo opens it, letting the king see the pieces of broken copper inside. the officer produces a handful of large nails and gives them directly to the king. the king nods his head in approval and shows the nails to his attendants. they are impressed.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{... and tell him that i want to make him a very special gift as one king to another...}
<A>__{various officers raise their eyebrows at this.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{of these precious things, which my fathers and forefathers have worn for many long years before...}
<A>__{dom paulo solemnly and without a blush removes the cheap rosary from around his neck and offers it to the king.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{i shouldn't do this, but it is such a special occasion, and he is such a great and worthy king...}
<A>__{this is translated. the king refuses to accept the rosary. instead he is pointing to a couple of chunky and valuable looking rings on dom paulo's fingers which he has forgotten to remove.}
<C>__{slave}
<D>__{he says he could not accept such a treasured gift, something of such value to your family... instead he would be happy to take one or two of the old rings you have on your fingers... but please do not insist that he take your necklace...}
<A>__{it is impossible to know if the king is being naively polite or hugely clever. dom paulo's officers enjoy a muted titter as he peels off his precious rings and gives them to the king, replacing the worthless baubles around his own neck. the king begins talking again. the slave translates.}
<C>__{slave}
<D>__{he will give you guides to help you across the first of the big rivers... it is ten days from here...}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{thank you, thank you...}
<A>__{the slave continues.}
<C>__{slave}
<D>__{... and he asks you to be ready to leave the beach in two days time... he cannot permit you to stay longer...}
<A>__{dom paulo looks shocked.}
<C>__{slave}
<D>__{because with the new moon the turtles will arrive and lay their eggs... you may frighten them... you must be gone...}
<A>__{the mention of turtles' eggs almost turns the stomachs of most of the survivors, even the fit ones. the king and his followers walk back into the forest. soon the survivors are alone again, with the lost looking cow the natives have left. a doomed cow if ever there was.}
