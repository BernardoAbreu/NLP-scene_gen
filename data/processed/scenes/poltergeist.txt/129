<L>__{exterior the top of a hill day}
<B>__{steve and teague}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{i’m so very proud of this place.}
<A>__{steve and teague stand on a hill overlooking the entire cuesta verde estates. teague’s bronco sits off to one side.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i’ve been up here once or twice. diane calls it vanity pointerior}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{so who’s to say an artist shouldn’t step back from his easel to admire the sum of his parts?}
<C>__{steven}
<P>__{(almost forgetting his}
<D>__{ordeal for a few seconds}
<P>__{of mental freedom)}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{when they build our model home, there was nothing down there. just freshly turned earth and a lotta wooden stakes and miles and miles of string.}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{one of your children was born in your house.}
<C>__{steven}
<P>__{(not smiling now)}
<D>__{carol anne.}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{i understand she’s missed a lot of school lately. trask’s daughter’s in the same nursery class. she have the flu as well?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{yeah, we’ve all got the same thing.}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{i’m sorry. i didn’t see her.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{oh, she’s around.}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{are you?}
<C>__{steven}
<P>__{(his mind in the valley, snaps out of it)}
<D>__{am i what?}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{are you thinking of leaving cuesta verde?}
<C>__{steven}
<P>__{(dazed)}
<D>__{i can’t believe how a day can be so beautiful. you wonder how anyone can have a problem in the world on a day like this.}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<P>__{(kicking up some sod with his heel)}
<D>__{nice spot for a bay window, wouldn’t you agree?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{if you’re living up here, great. wouldn’t be so terrific from the valley, looking up at a lotta houses cutting into these hills.}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{you don’t have to live in the valley any more.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{what are you getting at?}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{phase five is going up right where we’re standing. this could be your master bedroom suite. that could be your view. you interested?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{mr. teague, that’s a very generous offer but i’m not a developer.}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{you’re responsible for 42% of sales, almost half of what we’re looking at down there. almost seventy million dollars of dwellings and property. maybe a generation of security that no one can put a price tag on. we should have made you a full partner three years ago... i don’t want to lose you now.}
<A>__{steve doesn’t know what to think. so much is piling up so suddenly. it’s a golden opportunity that two weeks ago would have meant a hawaiian vacation and days of happiness and celebration. steve turns around to take in the view.}
