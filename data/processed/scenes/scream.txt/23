<L>__{exterior school courtyard later}
<A>__{students sit at outdoor tables eating lunch. crowded at one table is the "gang". this consists of sidney, billy and tatum. next to tatum, sits her boyfriend stuart, with his arm draped across her back. he's a billy wannabe. almost the jock, almost handsome, almost cool. he tries way to hard. across the table is the fifth wheel, randy. a tall and gangly kid with no such billy like aspirations. a witty jokester who elevates geek to coolness.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{hunt? why would they ask if you like to hunt?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i don't know, they just did.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{because their bodies were gutted.}
<A>__{sidney flinches.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{thanks randy.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{they didn't ask me if i like to hunt.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{because there's no way a girl could have killed them.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{that is so sexist. the killer could easily be female basic instinct.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{that was an ice pick not exactly the same.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{yeah, casey and steve were completely hollowed out. takes a man to do something like that.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{or a man's mentality.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(quiet, almost to herself)}
<D>__{how do you gut someone?}
<A>__{all eyes turn to sidney. a serious silence. and then:}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{you take a knife and slit from the groin to the sternum.}
<A>__{sidney shivers down to her soul. the whole table rolls their eyes at stu.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{what? she asked.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{it's called tact, you fuckrag.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{remember in jaws when they caught the wrong shark at first and richard dreyfuss cut it open to look foe body parts and all they found was a licence plate and all this white milky goo.}
<A>__{stu leans over and socks randy in the arm.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{you heard billy shut the fuck up.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{hey, stu? didn't you use to date casey?}
<A>__{stu's taken back, a little off guard.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{for about two seconds.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{before she dumped him foe steve.}
<A>__{tatum turns to stu, surprised.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{i thought you dumped her for me.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i did. he's full of shit.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{and are the police aware you dated the victim?}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{what are you saying? that i killed her or something?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{it would certainly improve your high school q.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{stu was with me last night.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{oooooh...before or after he sliced and diced.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{fuck you, nut case. where were you last night?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{working, thank you.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{i thought blockbuster fired you.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{twice.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i didn't kill anybody.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{no one's saying you did.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{besides }
<P>__{(perfect stu mimic)}
<D>__{"takes a man to do something like that."}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i'm gonna gut your ass in a second.}
<C>__{randy}
<P>__{(to stu)}
<D>__{did you really put her liver in the mailbox? i hear they found her liver in the mailbox.}
<C>__{tatum}
<P>__{(eyeing sidney)}
<D>__{randy, you goon fuck, i'm eating here.}
<A>__{stu nibbles at tatum's neck.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{yeah, randy, she's getting mad. i think you better liver alone.}
<A>__{stu cracks up at his own joke. the others just moan. sidney is about to crawl out of her skin, trying hard to ignore it all.}
