<D>__{oh, no. we have a sick patient here, nurse. prepare the o.r., stat!}

<C>__{sid}
<D>__{she's lying! whatever she says it's not true!}
<A>__{sid throws the doll to the ground and runs after hannah, slamming the door behind him. woody and buzz peer out of the backpack at their new surroundings. heavy metal posters, discarded toy remains and power tools adorn the messy room. they are in hell...toy hell.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{we are gonna die.}
<P>__{(bolting out of the pack)}
<D>__{i'm outta here!}
<A>__{woody leaps from the bed to the doorknob and struggles to open it. no good. woody drops to the floor.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{locked! there's gotta be another way out of here.}
<A>__{sfx: rolling sound woody is startled by the noise. a small yo yo rolls out from behind a box and falls on its side. spooked, woody grabs a pencil from the floor and brandishes it like a weapon. just then a shadow passes by woody. he turns quickly but sees nothing.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{uh...buzz? was that you?}
<A>__{woody hurriedly trades his pencil for a larger flashlight. he hears a noise from under sid's bed. woody turns on the flashlight and shines the beam in the direction of the noise, illuminating... a baby doll head's profile}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{hey! hi, there, little fellah! come out here. do you know a way out of here?}
<A>__{the baby doll moves out from under the bed, revealing a one eyed doll head atop a spider like body made of erector set pieces.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(gasp!!)}
<A>__{the creature extends its legs and rises up taller than woody. scared speechless, woody keeps his flashlight beam locked on}
<B>__{babyface.}
<A>__{various other mutant toys begin to emerge from the shadows: a toy fishing pole with fashion doll legs, a skateboard with a combat soldier's torso screwed to the front end, a jack in the box with a rubber hand for a head, (and others). woody leaps onto the bed and hides behind buzz.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{b b b buzz!}
<A>__{buzz and woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war as they grab all the janie and pterodactyl parts, dragging them off into the shadows.}
