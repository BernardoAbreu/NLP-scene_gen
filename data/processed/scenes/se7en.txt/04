<A>__{somerset is in a window seat, smoking a cigarette, looking out the speeding train. he is near the back of the car, away from the few other passengers. outside, farms, small homes and lawns pass. the entire panorama is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun. the light flickers across somerset's placid face.}

<A>__{the train is nearly full. somerset has his suitcase on the aisle seat beside him. he has a hardcover book unopened on his lap. he still stares out the window, but his disposition has soured. the train is passing an ugly, swampy field. a car's burnt out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken. a little further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their coats matted with blood. somerset turns his head to watch the dogs. away in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight.}
