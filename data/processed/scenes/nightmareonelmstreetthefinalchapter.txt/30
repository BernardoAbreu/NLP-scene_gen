<L>__{interior warehouse day}
<A>__{the stretcher with jacob blasts through a wall and starts to race across the floor of the building that jacob had been sweeping up the day before. it careens along, actually taking a few turns, like it has a mind of its own, heading for a shallow pit in the middle of the warehouse. the stretcher hits the pit, drops a bit, swings up violently, and stops in a vertical position like a rake that has been stepped on and a black human shape shoots out of jacob's body from intertial force, staying upright as it slides across the floor, spins, stops, then changes into:}
<B>__{freddy krueger}
<A>__{freddy has his hands on his hips and a grin on his face.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{thanks for the lift, kid!}
<A>__{he saunters up to jacob who is still strapped to the vertical stretcher. krueger waves his knives and wiggles his tongue.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what do you want from me?}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{i already got it! the rest i'm going to get from your new little friends.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{leave them alone!}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{it's my duty to clean up the neighborhood!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what have you done with my town?}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{aw, poor baby's homesick, isn't he? don't worry. we'll all be one happy family soon. wanna be the first recruit?}
<A>__{freddy raises his blades and swings. the straps around jacob drop away as his body falls to the floor. he scrambles to his feet and starts to run. freddy laughs with jacob running as he heads for a door. before he gets there, the door swings open and freddy leans casually in his way.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{what's the matter? don't want to be part of my expansion project?}
<A>__{jacob turns right around and races back across the warehouse.}
<B>__{at the dumpster}
<A>__{jacob races around to the other side and there's krueger again.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{today, rosedale. tomorrow, the world!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{over my dead body!}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{as you wish.}
<A>__{freddy cranks up his knives and looms over jacob. and three flashes of light blast out behind the boy. jacob rolls away as freddy holds up an arm to block the blinding glare. the light fades. the dream police have arrived. we'll call the small one sound cop. he stands there motionless as a loud and horrible growing noise emanates from his clenched teeth. this guy's bark is worse than his bite. the female in black is blade cop. from nowhere she produces two nasty looking knives, one in each hand. she spins the blades in the air like an expert samurai. the large one we'll call power cop. he reaches out for the dumpster, and with one hand sends it tumbling away with a crash. freddy frowns.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{uh oh. too many parking tickets.}
<A>__{the dream police fan out around krueger, surrounding him. power cop leaps at freddy, grabs him and tosses him in the air. freddy tumbles, rolls and bounces right back up on his feet. right next to blade. she swings her knives. freddy dodges. swings hi own blades at her. she ducks. freddy spins again. right towards: sound cop. the short man in black opens his mouth and a sound like a foghorn at a rock concert blares out. the force of it hitting freddy like a fist. freddy bounces back. and once again he nimbly pops up. he glares at the dream police.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{don't interfere!}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{we have to.}
<C>__{sound cop}
<D>__{it's our job.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{get a new one.}
<A>__{and freddy starts to spin. slowly at first, then faster and faster, until his image starts to blur. the police circle the whirling image, holding back to see what will happen nexterior krueger stops spinning. and his clothes are different. his red and green stripes have been replaced by black and white ones. there is a number printed across his chest. he's dressed like a convict. freddy grins.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{time to blow this jointerior}
<A>__{boom! a hole is suddenly blown in the high ceiling above krueger. the building is suddenly filled with the beams of moving spotlights and the sound of blasting sirens. a rope falls down through the hole. freddy grabs it and whoosh! he's yanked up.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{you'll never get me, coppers!}
<A>__{and away he's gone. after a few seconds the spotlights fade away and the sirens die. the dream police look up seemingly unsure of their next action. then power cop kicks a pile of lumber, sending wood flying dozens of yards away.}
<C>__{power cop}
<D>__{goddamnit!}
<A>__{sound cop shakes his head. blade looks frustrated. jacob steps up behind them.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{alright...just who the hell are you guys?}
<A>__{the black clad trio turn around in unison and look at jacob. there is a pause. then:}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{we're the dream police.}
<A>__{jacob almost laughs.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{power cop}
<D>__{the dream police. didn't you hear her, man?}
<A>__{power cop turns to sound cop and flips up his visor revealing his face. he's a sixteen year old black boy. heavyset features, sweat dripping down his cheeks. he's kincaid from nightmare 3. and he's pissed.}
<C>__{power cop }
<D>__{we try and save this guy's ass and then he goes off and cops an attitude.}
<A>__{sound cop flips up his helmet. he's joey, the former mute boy.}
<C>__{sound cop}
<D>__{i think you're the wrong guy to talk about attitudes.}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{guys, guys. this is getting us nowhere.}
<A>__{she takes her helmet completely off, long dark hair tumbling over her shoulders. it's taryn, the ex junkie. these three, they're the dream warriors. or at least they used to be.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hello? may i butt in here and ask some more stupid questions?}
<A>__{the three of them stop bickering and turn to jacob. blade walks up to jacob. her two partners assume position behind her.}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{we don't know much more than you do. what we do know is that we've been recruited...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{by who?}
<C>__{sound cop}
<D>__{we don't know.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{i think that's obvious.}
<C>__{power cop}
<D>__{the shit's about to hit the fan.}
<C>__{sound cop}
<D>__{krueger's discovered new powers.}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{he's ripped a hole between dreams and reality.}
<C>__{power cop}
<D>__{our own powers have been amplified.}
<C>__{sound cop}
<D>__{we only hope it will be enough.}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{but we're going to need your help.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{me? what can i do? just who are you guys...really?}
<A>__{blade puts her helmet back on. her face turns grim.}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{we were like you. we fought freddy krueger many years ago. our souls were released from his grip. no we're back to try again.}
<A>__{all three of them drop their visors down at the same time.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i still don't understand what...}
<A>__{jacob's voice starts to garble. he keeps trying to talk but the words come out twisted and clipped. he raises a hand to his throat. the hand is transparent. jacob looks at his body as it slowly starts to disappear and now he's completely mute.}
<C>__{sound cop}
<D>__{freddy krueger can't hurt us anymore.}
<C>__{power cop}
<D>__{because we're already dead.}
<A>__{jacob vanishes completely.}
