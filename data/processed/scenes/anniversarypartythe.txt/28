<A>__{most everyone's moved through to the dining room. the table is filled with platters of beautifully prepared food. candles, flowers. astrid, newly arrived, carrying a miniature furball, of questionable breed, is first in line and halfway around the table. she feeds "anouk" bits from the table enroute.}
<C>__{astrid}
<P>__{(barely looks up as sally comes into the room)}
<D>__{so who won?}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(raises her hand)}
<D>__{a triumph. when did you get here?}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{ten, fifteen minutes ago.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{why didn't you come in?}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{i hate the sight of blood. you guys don't take prisoners.}
<C>__{skye}
<P>__{(charmed by the bundle in astrid's arm)}
<D>__{oh how sweet.}
<A>__{the furball bares teeth and growls.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{she's insanely jealous.}
