<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior ashdown street day}
<A>__{this is a run down district in the northwestern part of london. on the corner is no. 32 a dilapidated abandoned shop, with windows painted halfway up. as camera approaches the building, we hear sawing from inside.}
<L>__{interior empty shop day}
<A>__{it is dusty, cobwebby, quite forbidding. in the rear wall is a closed sliding door, indented about a foot into the shop. nearby stands a large, square object, covered with a tarpaulin. high up in the rear wall is a slanted skylight, fitted with an iron grill. from outside, holmes, in deerstalker and inverness, can be seen sawing through the iron bars. watson and gabrielle are beside him.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{hammer... chisel.}
<A>__{watson hands him the indicated tools. holmes chips away the cement from the top and bottom of the last bar, then using it as a hinge, swings the grill open. he lets himself through the skylight, drops to the floor. watson now helps gabrielle through the skylight, lowers her toward holmes, who puts his arms around her waist, eases her to the floor. for a brief moment he keeps his arms around her. watson has now squeezed through the skylight.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{here!}
<A>__{he hands the tools to holmes, jumps to the floor. gabrielle is looking around the shop.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{it's so strange to think i've been writing to a place like this all these months.}
<A>__{watson crosses to the square tarpaulin covered object. he lifts up one corner of the tarp and is greeted by a loud twittering of birds. what he has uncovered is a large cage and about a hundred canaries, suddenly disturbed, are flapping around unside.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{look at all these canaries. do you suppose this could have been a pet shop?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{maybe.}
<P>__{(pointing off)}
<D>__{here comes our letter.}
<A>__{through the front window, the silhouette of a postman can be seen approaching. he drops a letter through the slot in the front door, moves on. the letter lands on a section of floor which is solidly covered with dust except for a series of double tracks, running to the door and curving back.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{now we are faced with the most nerve wracking part of the detective's job doing nothing.}
<A>__{he reassembles the three tools, fitting each section into another, to form a cane.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{mr. holmes }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{i don't know how i'm going to pay you for all this. the purse with my money is somewhere at the bottom of the thames.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it could be worse. you could be at the bottom of the thames much to your discomfort and much to my chagrin.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i don't understand how anybody picks up letters here.}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{no footprints just tracks. what does it mean?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i would surmise somebody is using ice skates if it weren't for a conspicuous absence of ice.}
<A>__{they become aware of a squeaking noise outside the rear of the shop, growing louder as it gets nearer. the noise stops, there is the sound of a lock turning, then the rattle of a chain.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(in a frantic whisper)}
<D>__{what do we do now?}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(unfazed)}
<D>__{this way.}
<A>__{he leads gabrielle and watson toward the rear wall, right next to the door. they flatten themselves with their backs to the wall, just as the door slides open concealing them from view. revealed is the mews behind the shop. in the door is an old biddy with straggly hair, sitting in a wheelchair. in her lap are a bulky paper bag and a tin pitcher filled with water. as she wheels herself inside, the unoiled wheelchair squeaks loudly. she stops in front of the cage, pulls on a rope which runs through a pulley in the ceiling and the tarpaulin rises into the air, exposing the canaries.}
<C>__{woman in wheelchair}
<P>__{(addressing birds)}
<D>__{good morning, my pretties. here's mum with your breakfast. did you think i'd forgotten you?}
<A>__{she pours grain from the paper bag into a feeder hanging inside the cage, pours water from the pitcher into a trough.}
<C>__{woman in wheelchair}
<D>__{some of you will be going on a little trip soon i hate to lose you but even an old woman has to live. although you might well ask, why?}
<A>__{she cackles to herself, glances toward the front door.}
<C>__{woman in wheelchair}
<D>__{oh. you never told me we had a letter.}
<A>__{she starts to wheel herself toward the front of the shop. through a crack in the door behind which our three are hiding, we see holmes' eye watching her. the old woman reaches the letter, picks it up, studies the address. then she hears something, glances toward the open rear door. a horse drawn wagon with a canvas top is just pulling into the mews. two carters jump down from the driver's seat, and one of them takes a small bird cage from the back of the wagon. as they start in through the door, the old woman drops the letter into her lap, wheels herself toward them.}
<C>__{first carter}
<D>__{morning, duchess.}
<C>__{woman in wheelchair}
<D>__{morning.}
<C>__{second carter}
<D>__{what have you been doing with yourself?}
<C>__{woman in wheelchair}
<D>__{what do you think? taking dancing lessons.}
<P>__{(she stops in front of the cage)}
<D>__{how many do you want this time?}
<C>__{first carter}
<D>__{two dozen.}
<A>__{he opens the door of the small cage, the bottom of which is covered with newspaper, starts transferring canaries into it from the large cage.}
<C>__{woman in wheelchair}
<D>__{what are they doing with all those canaries? what's going on up there?}
<C>__{second carter}
<D>__{look, duchess, we don't know and we don't want to know.}
<C>__{first carter}
<D>__{when you work for jonah, it's better not to ask questions.}
<A>__{through the crack in the door behind which he is hidden, we see holmes' eye studying the small bird cage, as the canaries are being transferred into it. we move in close on the small cage, and see the soiled newspaper spread on the bottom. the masthead reads:}
<B>__{inverness courier.}
<C>__{first carter}
<P>__{(counting as he transfers canaries)}
<D>__{... twenty two, twenty three, twenty four.}
<A>__{he closes the doors of the cages, picks up the small cage. his companion indicates the letter in the woman's lap.}
<C>__{second carter}
<D>__{how about that letter? does that go, too?}
<C>__{woman in wheelchair}
<D>__{no. that's going to be picked up in person.}
<A>__{she chuckles. the carriers exit into the mews, stash the cage in the back of the wagon, mount the driver's seat.}
<C>__{woman in wheelchair}
<P>__{(to birds)}
<D>__{all right, my pretties. back to sleep you go. see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{she pulls the rope and the tarpaulin drops back over the cage. then she deposits the letter on top of the covered cage, wheels herself out the rear door. as she slides it shut from outside, our trio is revealed in their hiding places behind the door. there is the sound of the chain rattling, the lock snapping, and the squeaky wheels moving off.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(a sigh of relief)}
<D>__{i really thought we were done for.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{the art of concealment, my dear watson, is merely a matter of being in the right place at the right time.}
<A>__{they step forward, and through the painted shop window watch the old woman wheel herself down the street.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{did you hear what she said? you really think emile is going to pick up the letter himself?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it certainly would simplify things, wouldn't it?}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{maildrops and canaries and wheelchairs... and what was all that about jonah? and what do you suppose they're doing up there? and where is up there?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{my guess would be scotland. inverness, to be more precise.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{inverness?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{didn't you notice the paper at the bottom of their cage? the inverness courier.}
<A>__{gabrielle glances casually at the letter the old woman left lying on top of the cage, and her expression changes.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{mr. holmes! this letter }
<P>__{(she picks it up)}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<P>__{(holding it out to him)}
<D>__{it's addressed to you.}
<A>__{holmes takes the letter, examines the envelope. it is indeed addressed to him.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{nevertheless }
<A>__{with the saw end of his cane, he slits the envelope open, removes the enclosure, unfolds it. we see the letter in his hand as he reads it out loud. the letterhead says: diogenes club, st. james's, london.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{my dear sherlock: i expect you and dr. watson to join me at the club immediately upon reciept of this note. according to my calculations, that should be at 11:40 a.m. your brother, mycroft.}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{what time do you make it, watson?}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(consulting watch)}
<D>__{11:43.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{either your watch is wrong, or mycroft has miscalculated. and knowing mycroft, i suggest you reset your watch.}
<A>__{watson automatcially obeys.}
