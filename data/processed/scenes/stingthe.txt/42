<A>__{the man wandering up and down the hall, wondering how he could have missed that room.}
<L>__{exterior chicago street day}
<A>__{the street runs along side an elevated train track. we pick up hooker coming down the street, eating a hot dog he bought with the money he just earned in the train station. he appears to be looking for an address, referring every now and then to the piece of paper luther gave him the night before. finally he stops in front of an old three story building which contains a carousel on the bottom 2 floors and what appear to be apartments on the third floor. he peers inside the big, sliding glass doors and seeing no sign of life, goes around to the side to look for a way in. a 35 year old woman, billie, appears in her bathrobe on the second floor landing and descends the stairs to get the morning paper. she's eating an apple. although she has just gotten up and looks it, she has the presence of one who is probably quite striking at other hours. the sight of hooker fazes her not at all.}

<D>__{yeh.}
<C>__{billie}
<D>__{why didn't you say so. i thought maybe you was a copper or somethin'.}
<A>__{she goes to a side door and unlocks it.}
<C>__{billie}
<D>__{it's the room in the back. he wasn't expecting you so soon though.}
<A>__{hooker's not quite sure what that means, but there's something about billie that makes him know that you don't ask.}
