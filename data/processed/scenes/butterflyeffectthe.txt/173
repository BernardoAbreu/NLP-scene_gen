<L>__{interior kayleigh's seedy hotel room continuous}
<A>__{the room is dirty and sparse, excepting charred bottom spoons, yellowed cotton balls and brown spotted squares of tin foil. evan doesn't hesitate to sit on the "soiled" bed.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<A>__{evan can't speak. his eyes begin to water.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i just needed to see... a friendly face.}
<A>__{his sincerity touches her.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{well, time is money, evan. so you...}
<A>__{evan reaches for his wallet and throws it on her dresser. kayleigh eyes the wallet. but makes no move to pick it up.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{well, i guess i can spare ten minutes for an old friend, right?}
<A>__{tears fall freely from evan's eyes.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{so how's tricks? sorry, occupational humor.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i get it. you can drop it now.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<P>__{(angry again)}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{no. just that you need to hurt me with it. i've been where you've been.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{ha! where's that?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{the bottom. when you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.}
<A>__{kayleigh watches evan silently.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{what's happened to you?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you wouldn't believe me. i mean, people always say, "you wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{i've seen some sickening shit. i don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{because you're... different.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{different? how?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{let me ask you a question. just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{on the bridge. how did you know that tommy had your dog? that was no fucking hunch.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{do you remember when i was a kid and i had those blackouts?}
<A>__{evan continues and kayleigh listens with a mixture of intense interest and matched skepticism.}
