<L>__{exterior hess house afternoon}
<A>__{we are watching the house from the crops. we see graham inside the house, closing the window shutters in one room after another. we see a stack of wooden boards on the porch. our view moves to the barn where isabelle is tied. she is not pacing. she is not barking. she sits staring right at us. she is shivering. our view moves to the garage building where we see merrill carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs. he's moving into the main house. merrill walks across the yard. his eyes look around carefully as he moves. part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses the lawn. he stops walking and starts to gather up the fallen things. he picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs encased in glass cases. the glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has cracked. he takes the ball out. stares at it. we watch from the crops as merrill puts down his pile of clothes and things on the grass. he looks around and finds what he's looking for. a rake. merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle. with the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball in the other, he turns to face the crops.}
<B>__{we pull back a little into the crops. part of our view is}
<A>__{obscured by stalks, but we still see merrill clearly. merrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into a batter's stance. his left leg digs into the grass in front of him. his weight is mostly on his back leg. he looks out into the distance high over the crops. he throws the baseball up in the air... merrill grabs the wooden handle. merrill's shoulders move with blinding speed. the wooden rake handle slices the air. and misses the ball. the ball drops at merrill's feet. we watch as merrill picks up the ball and tries again. this time his shoulders move even faster. the wooden stick actually makes a resonant sound as it cuts the air. the ball drops at merrill's feet. we watch through the crops as merrill snatches the ball up and tries a third time. this time he yells as he swings. he rips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the eye. the baseball drops at his feet. strike three. merrill stands still in the yard. he's breathing a little heavy as he stares down at the ball. he gently picks it up. he walks back to his pile of things and then suddenly turns. he throws the ball in the air as he does. his left leg goes out. his weight goes to his right leg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and power...}
<B>__{the sound of the baseball hitting the wooden handle cracks across the whole yard.}
<A>__{the ball rockets into the air. we watch it fly overhead... sail high over the crops... it becomes a tiny dot in the sky. after a long beat of silence it comes back to earth. it lands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air. it cleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops. maybe more. we look back to merrill standing in the backyard. he drops the wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things. he piles them in his arms. when his arms are full, he starts for the porch. we watch from the crops as merrill goes}
