<L>__{interior comb's office at the clearinghouse day}
<A>__{combs sits passively on the edge of his desk glancing across the room every now and then at riley, who is slumped uneasily in a folding chair, looking like a defendant at the inquisition. both remain silent, like two men in a waiting room. suddenly, what they've been waiting for arrives. lonnegan comes into the office, flanked by his bodyguards. skipping the usual pleasantries, he walks right over to riley.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{all right, riley. what the hell happened?}
<C>__{riley}
<P>__{(not looking at him)}
<D>__{we missed him.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{you weren't hired to miss him.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{there wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there. we made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. somebody musta wised him up.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{yeh, and what does cole say about that?}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{i don't know. he took it hard.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{all right, get outa here. you're outta work.}
<A>__{riley gets up and drags himself out the door like a whipped dog.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{we'll put salino on it. i need somebody careful.}
<C>__{combs}
<D>__{salino? why waste our best people on a small time job like this? it ain't no heavy gee we're after. the guy's a five and dime grifter.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{then why ain't he dead?}
<C>__{combs}
<D>__{they didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all. they'll get him next time.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{use salino. it'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.}
<A>__{combs gives up. the second time's the charm.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{and tell cole i wanta see him when he gets in.}
<C>__{combs}
<D>__{he's not comin' in. not to get bounced off a job anyway.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{he had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house. made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.}
<A>__{combs keeps his mouth shut. there's no way to talk to lonnegan when he's like this.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(cooling a little)}
<D>__{this is salino's job now, vince. if cole wants to muscle in on it, that's his business. but he's breakin' the rules and when salino finds out about it, i can't feel sorry for what's gonna happen to him.}
