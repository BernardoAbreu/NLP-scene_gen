<L>__{interior nice house night}
<A>__{the door opens and dwayne stumbles through. he has made it home. he drops like a puppet whose strings have been cut. from where his head has landed on the floor, dwayne sees something odd...long red streaks. he crawls forward on all fours to investigate... it is a trail of sticky red blood. dwayne follows it until he comes upon its source...the crumpled body of his father, lying face down. dwayne's face: shock and confusion and joy.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{dwayne inches closer, pokes the body. nothing.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{dad, are you }
<A>__{the body emits a low groan. dwayne rolls it over. his father's face is white, he's lost a lot of blood, but he isn't totally spent yet. he struggles to speak }
<C>__{major}
<D>__{dwayne...}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{some guy...said you hired him to kill me.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{dad, i...i'd never...}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{look at you...lip quivering like you're getting fucked...be a man.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i am a man! i killed you, didn't i? now i'm gonna use your money to open a tanning salon where they let you fuck the chicks.}
<A>__{this stirs something in the major.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{you mean...like those whorehouses...in 'nam...i used to tell you about?}
<A>__{dwayne softens at the recollection.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{those were great bedtime stories.}
<A>__{the major nods. opens his hand. reveals a cordless phone. dwayne looks to the bloody streaks down the hall, leading to the phone table. the major dragged himself the whole way.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{medics are late...probably a couple lazy spicks...you tell 'em i said so...all right, son?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{sure thing, pop.}
<A>__{the major looks up at dwayne's bruised face, as if for the first time.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{hell of thing...i think i may...actually respect you now.}
<A>__{dwayne's eyes well up. he reaches out, cradles his father as he expires. it's like a very bloody, white trash version of the pieta. dwayne sobs uncontrollably, until he drops his father and pound pound pounds his chest in some approximation of a life saving resuscitation.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{get up, you pussy! come on, soldier!}
<A>__{pull away as dwayne pounds the body and distant sirens grow nearer.}
