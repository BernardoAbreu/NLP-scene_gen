<L>__{exterior mountain, thick jungle clearing day}
<A>__{footprints. a dog's nose follows the tracks. this is gamma, a bulldog.}
<C>__{gamma}
<D>__{oh, here it is. i picked up the bird's scent!}
<A>__{a second dog: beta, a rottweiler.}
<C>__{beta}
<D>__{wait a minute, wait a minute! what is this? chocolate. i smell chocolate.}
<C>__{gamma}
<D>__{i'm getting prunes and denture cream! who are they?}
<C>__{beta}
<D>__{ah man, master will not be pleased. we'd better tell him someone took the bird, right alpha?}
<A>__{alpha, a doberman pinscher, sits with his back to them.}
<C>__{alpha}
<P>__{(high pitched voice)}
<D>__{no. soon enough the bird will be ours yet again.}
<A>__{alpha's voice is high and squeaky, as if he's breathed in helium.}
<C>__{alpha }
<D>__{find the scent, my compadres and you two shall have much rewardings from master for the toil factor you wage.}
<A>__{beta and gamma look at each other.}
<C>__{beta}
<D>__{hey alpha, i think there's something wrong with your collar. you must have bumped it.}
<C>__{gamma}
<D>__{yeah, your voice sounds funny!}
<A>__{beta and gamma laugh. alpha turns. they stop laughing.}
<C>__{alpha}
<D>__{beta. gamma. mayhaps you desire to squirrel!}
<A>__{all three dogs look for the squirrel. false alarm.}
<C>__{alpha }
<D>__{mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that i have been assigned by my strength and cunning?}
<C>__{beta}
<D>__{no no. but maybe dug would. you might want to ask him.}
<A>__{beta and gamma snicker derisively.}
<C>__{gamma}
<D>__{yeah, i wonder if he's found the bird on his very special mission.}
<C>__{alpha}
<D>__{do not mention dug to me at this time. his fool's errand will keep him most occupied, most occupied indeed. ha ha ha. do you not agree with that which i am saying to you now?}
<C>__{beta}
<D>__{sure, but the second master finds out you sent dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat.}
<C>__{alpha}
<D>__{you are wise, my trusted lieutenant.}
<A>__{alpha powers up a video screen on beta's collar.}
<C>__{alpha }
<D>__{this is alpha calling dug. come in, dug.}
<A>__{the screen shows ground moving past: the view from dug's collar.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{hi alpha. hey, your voice sounds funny.}
<C>__{alpha}
<D>__{i know, i know! have you seen the bird?}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{why yes, the bird is my prisoner now.}
<C>__{gamma}
<D>__{yeah, right.}
<A>__{the screen view adjusts to see the bird. it hisses.}
<C>__{alpha}
<D>__{impossible! where are you?!}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{i am here with the bird and i will bring it back and then you will like me. oh, gotta go.}
<A>__{on the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a boy's face. it's russell.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(on video screen)}
<D>__{hey dug! who you talking to?}
<A>__{the video screen goes blank. the dogs bark excitedly.}
<C>__{beta}
<D>__{what's dug doing?}
<C>__{gamma}
<D>__{why's he with that small mailman?}
<C>__{beta}
<D>__{where are they?}
<A>__{alpha pushes a button on beta's collar. a tracking device locates dug.}
<C>__{alpha}
<D>__{there he is. come on!}
<A>__{the dogs sprint off into the jungle.}
