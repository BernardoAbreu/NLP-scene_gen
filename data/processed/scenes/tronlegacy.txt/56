<T>__{intercut with:}
<L>__{exterior x net nexus under construction plexor's vehicle}
<A>__{plexor's vehicle circuitry forms image of mega.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{report.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{we interfaced with tron. he escaped into a dark zone.}
<L>__{interior ancient computer system tunnel}
<A>__{around a corner, rush comes to retrieve his disk. he pauses to eavesdrop on mega's communication:}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{the random one has proven effective?}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{he is all glitches and bad data. he virtually got us de rezzed. i recommend we terminate this mission.}
<A>__{rush listens, hurt and angry.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{no. proceed. if you keep tron on the run, he cannot attack x net.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{it's a poor allocation of resources.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{you have your instructions.}
<A>__{circuits go dark. mega turns, running smack into:}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{"all glitches and bad data." what's up with you? ever since i got here, you've been working against me.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{i act as plexor programs me.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{blah blah blah. you've got you own processor. i can feel it working overtime. did meg program you to mess with me?}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{i have no match for "meg" }
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{first, you don't want to come with me, then you're all over me on the light cycle so you can dump us over and blow the plan. we would have nailed tron by now if it wasn't for you. what's your malfunction?}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{don't troubleshoot me!}
<A>__{angry silence. eyes locked.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{the most effective alternative is to return to the main cpu and anticipate tron's next attack.}
<A>__{she moves to exit past him. he snags her arm, pulls her back and kisses her. energy zaps between them, racing through their body circuits. rush downloads the spiky sensation. mega remains cold and bewildered. outside, krod tosses his disk, moving to track as it arcs through the air. he notices rush and mega kissing. digs it vicariously.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{you ram hog!}
<A>__{his disk clunks him on the head. mega breaks the kiss, backing off, conflicted. arcs of energy stretch between them, then snap loose.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{it's what i'm programmed to do.}
<A>__{mega tries to ignore the kiss. she exits past the guys.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{what were you doing with her?}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{nothing. she had a glitch. i was just pinging her eprom.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{she let you?}
<P>__{i beem (o.s.)}
<D>__{there's a way through!}
<A>__{rush, krod and mega hurry to see: i beem zap zap zaps toward them, scared to death }
<D>__{i beem tron attacked us! d rezz has him cornered!}
<A>__{rush stows his disk on his back }
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{we've got him now.}
