<A>__{ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar where the pirateship waits. just before he reaches the hangar, darth vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not ten feet away. vader lights his saber. ben also ignites his and steps slowly forward.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{i've been waiting for you, obi wan. we meet again, at last. the circle is now complete.}
<A>__{ben kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive position. the fearsome dark knight takes a defensive stance.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{when i left you, i was but the learner; now i am the master.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{only a master of evil, darth.}
<A>__{the two galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right moment. ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. he shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes. ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked by a lightning movement of the sith. a masterful slash stroke by vader is blocked by the old jedi. another of the jedi's blows is blocked, then countered. ben moves around the dark lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. the two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments with laser swords locked in mid air, creating a low buzzing sound.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{your powers are weak, old man.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you can't win, darth. if you strike me down, i shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.}
<A>__{their lightsabers continue to meet in combat.}
