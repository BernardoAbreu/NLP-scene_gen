<A>__{snores from rod. tina sits up. past her to the window. the wind moves again; the trees brush the window with their shadows. then another pebble. rap! tina slips to the window.}
<L>__{exterior tina's backyard. night.}
<A>__{she looks out on an old yard with a patch of bananna trees rattling in the santa ana winds. it seems deserted, though the welling dark won't let her be sure. then another pebble pap! hitting with a sharp rack focus. a low angle to window as tina jumps back, startled. she hadn't seen that one coming. but she's drawn back to the glass out of curiousity, straining to see in the dark. it's as if the stones are materializing out of thin air.}
