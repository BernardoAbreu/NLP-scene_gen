<L>__{interior the tabernacle}
<A>__{indy jumps through the flames into what is now a tent of fire. he looks around at the dead bodies, then at the ark. the lid has slammed down shut again and the ark shines gold in the flames. before it, where belloq once stood, is a pile of ash and charred debris. indy registers this, then continues to scan the scene.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{marion! marion, can you hear me?}
<A>__{suddenly, indy looks as the far side of the tabernacle burns completely away, revealing marion, tied spread eagle between two upright posts. her nightgown is now in tatters, black with soot. she is gagged, but her eyes are screaming, focused on the flaming river of black oil which is about to engulf her feet. indy rushes toward her, unaware of a uniformed nazi who has appeared from the flames. marion looks up to see indy and the nazi leveling his submachine gun at indy. she motions desperately with her eyes. indy dives and rolls through the flames just as the nazi opens fire. from the floor, indy blasts the nazi. the river of burning oil is only a foot from marion. indy jumps up and runs toward the bound marion, his bayonet aimed directly at her. her wide eyes flash between the flames and the shining blade. expertly, indy slashes down both sides at marion, cutting all four bindings. marion falls backwards, away from the flames, but before she hits the ground, indy is there, catching her in his arms. they embrace. they kiss. they break.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{oh, indy! thank god you're here.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{glad i could make it.}
<A>__{indy rises, pulling her up with him. the tabernacle is burning away so fast that soon indy and marion will be completely exposed. indy rushes over and grabs the submachine gun and a luger from the dead nazi.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{let's get out of here.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{what about the ark?}
<A>__{indy stops, startled by her spunky attitude. he's considering their changes.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{are you game?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{hell yes! we've made it this far.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(grins at her)}
<D>__{okay. let's do it.}
<A>__{they approach the altar through the dying flames, indy slinging the submachine gun over his back. the long carrying poles are still in place.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{whatever you do, don't touch it. let's put it on the floor.}
<A>__{marion nods. each taking an end with the poles, they lift the ark from the altar and lower it to the floor. marion grunts under the weight. indy registers this, hands her the submachine gun. he pulls out his whip, motions her back, and sweeps the whip tightly around the body of the ark. the whip wraps snugly around the plaiting and indy ties it off. the ark is now harnessed to the whip handle. indy gives it an experimental pull and the ark slides across the smooth cement. indy indicates the direction of the second train tunnel.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{we'll go down that side. shoot anyone who looks at us crosseyed.}
