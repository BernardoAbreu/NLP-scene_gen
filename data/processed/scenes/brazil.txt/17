<A>__{brilliantly clear sky. from on high an odd bird like figure swoops down on the camera. as it comes closer we can see that it is, in fact, a man wearing strange wood and metal bird wings. in the bright sunshine their flapping movements create a brilliant, flashing effect. along with the wings, sam lowry (for this is he) wears an outfit that combines the best of flash gordon and a wwi fighter pilot. he sweeps past the camera and then, banking, rises back into shot in mcu. an ethereal voice can be heard calling "sam ... sam ... sam". he hovers, looking beyond the camera to something wonderful. cut to: face of stunningly beautiful girl, she is the idealised twin of jill layton ... her long hair swirls across her face partially obscuring it and making her appear slightly mysterious. the camera pulls away from her as soft billowing material sinuously undulates about her. it rises and falls like waves carried on the wind. as the camera glides back through this sea of gossamer we can see that the girl is being held aloft by and in it. a vast landscape stretches below her. the sun frames her in the sky. she and sam are engaged in a beautiful sensual aerial ballet. romantic music fills the soundtrack. sam swoops up and away. the girl floats in the distance as sam. rises in the foreground. she beckons to him. sam begins to flap back towards her. but then the dreamy quality of this scene is interrupted by threatening rumble. sam looks down. the ground far below him suddenly erupts as a massive, monolithic stone skyscraper bursts through the surface and soars upwards with a mighty rush.}
