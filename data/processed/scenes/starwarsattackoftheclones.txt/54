<L>__{interior naboo lake retreat, lodge, fireplace alcove twilight}
<A>__{a fire blazes in the open hearth. padme is sitting in front of it, gazing at the flames. she looks up as anakin arrives. she makes room for him. brief pause.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{may i tell you something?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{then how can i tell you?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{maybe you should use your jedi intuition.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{it doesn't work around you. my mind is always a muddle... i can only think of you.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{anakin, don't...}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{from the moment i met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when i haven't thought of you. and now that i'm close to you again, i'm in agony. the closer i get to you, the worse it gets. the thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over my mouth goes dry. i feel dizzy. i can't breathe. i'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. my heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. you are in my very soul, tormenting me. what can i do? i will do anything you ask...}
<A>__{silence. the logs flame in the hearth.}
<C>__{anakin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{if you are suffering as much as i am, tell me.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{...i can't. we can't. it's just not possible.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{anything's possible. padme, please listen...}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{you listen. we live in a real world. come back to it. you're studying to become a jedi knight. i'm a senator. if you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{then you do feel something! there's an extraordinary connection between us. you can't deny that.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{annie, it doesn't make any difference. jedi aren't allowed to marry. you swore an oath, remember? you'd be expelled from the order. i will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i was destined to be a jedi. i don't think i could be anything else. but you are asking me to be rational. that is something i know i cannot do. i wish i could wish my feelings away... but i can't.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i am not going to give into this. i'm not going to throw my life away. i have more important things to do than fall in love.}
<A>__{there is silence as they stare at the fire. anakin is thinking.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{it wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{then we'd be living a lie one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. mt sister saw it. so did my mother. i couldn't do that. could you, anakin? could you live like that?}
<A>__{silence for a moment.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{...no, you're right. it would destroy us.}
