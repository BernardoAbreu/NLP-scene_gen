<L>__{interior van}
<A>__{the chop shop is filled with electronic gadgets, wired to meters and monitors. there are shelves lined with medical supplies and rows of hanging tools, knives, cleavers, and stainless steel clamps. neo is strapped down to an ambulance cart, listening nervously as gizmo gets to work.}
<C>__{gizmo}
<D>__{okay, first we take a little look under the hood.}
<A>__{he pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they blink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising to varying levels of magnification.}
<C>__{gizmo}
<D>__{you're going to feel a little prick.}
<A>__{he inserts acupuncture like needles into neo's lower abdomen. the needles are wired to video monitors. hacksaw pilots the fiber optic lens.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{we think you're bugged. we can't take you to morpheus until you're clean.}
<C>__{gizmo}
<D>__{there it is.}
<A>__{on a monitor, we see the bug nestled in among neols large intestines.}
<C>__{gizmo}
<D>__{hit him with 10 ccs of local.}
<A>__{hacksaw loads a hypodermic needle and pumps an anesthetic around neols navel. using a device that looks like a miniature speculum, gizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick. typing into a calculator keypad wired to the pick, he automates the tip. on the monitor, we watch it telescope out and the end separate into a tiny hooked, metal claw.}
<C>__{gizmo}
<D>__{here, kitty, kitty, kitty.}
<A>__{the claw snags hold of the bug.}
<C>__{gizmo}
<D>__{gotcha!}
<A>__{but the bug reacts violently. neo screams as it wraps itself around the soft tissue web of intestine.}
<C>__{gizmo}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{what's happening?}
<C>__{gizmo}
<D>__{i don't know. they've never done that before.}
<A>__{neo writhes in pain.}
<C>__{gizmo}
<D>__{hold him down.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{jesus! god!}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{do something!}
<C>__{gizmo}
<D>__{i got it! maybe we can stun it.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{are you crazy? that will kill him.}
<A>__{we watch neo, who can't see what they are talking about.}
<C>__{gizmo}
<D>__{it'll work. come on, do it or hacksaw will.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{do what?}
<A>__{the instant he hears the word, he knows.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{clear.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{oh, shit }
<A>__{the cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his chest. gizmo wrestles with the bug.}
<C>__{gizmo}
<D>__{hit him again!}
<A>__{again, the electricity convulses through him as gizmo yanks the speculum out.}
<C>__{gizmo}
<D>__{got it!}
<A>__{trinity touches neo, who is just beginning to breathe. she eases the tape off his eyes.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{neo, are you okay?}
<A>__{he nods.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{it's over. we got it.}
<A>__{hanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire tap.}
<C>__{gizmo}
<D>__{nasty little bugger, ain't it?}
