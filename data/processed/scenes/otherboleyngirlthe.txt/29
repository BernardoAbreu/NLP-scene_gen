<D>__{i'm sorry.. exterior countryside day the sound of galloping hooves. mary rides hard, towards london.. interior great court tower of london day anne is led into a great courtroom lit by flickering torches, and filled with fifty or sixty of the country's most powerful noblemen. anne walks to the centre of the room, surveying her `jurors', noting that they have remained seated..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{it is a sad day for england when the nobles do not rise for their queen.}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{and even sadder when that same queen is charged with adultery and incest.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{charged is different to convicted, uncle. or is it not? in this court? deathly silence. the clearing of throats. then with much chair scraping, the nobles reluctantly get to their feet..}

<D>__{master cromwell, read out the indictment.. cromwell gets to his feet..}
<C>__{cromwell}
<D>__{the charge is that in the twenty eighth year of the reign of our sovereign henry, king of england, his wife, the queen, being seduced by the devil, did knowingly commit adultery, high treason and offences against god.}

<D>__{anne faces the lords, as she makes her case..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{my noble lords..the love i have for my brother is the love any sister would have for someone with whom she has grown up in the same house, nursed when sick, played games as children, shared life's celebrations. as anne delivers this speech, our camera slowly pulls back, back, towards the door..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{that is the love i have for him. not what you suggest. our camera pulls out through the door... ..and into a corridor beyond, where we find henry hunched in shadows, eavesdropping, his face cast in shadows..}
<P>__{anne (v o)}
<D>__{judge me, my lords, as you see fit. but never forget that your verdicts will be judged again by god, in the greatest court of all.. henry's face is a study of guilt. his knuckles whiten, his nails dig into his hands..}

<D>__{my lords, the time has come to cast your vote.}
<C>__{s}
<D>__{exterior countryside night mary gallops through shallow streams, spraying water.. interior courtroom day anne watches on as each lord takes it in turn to get to his feet, and deliver his verdict. first cromwell, then the seymours, then henry percy.. the verdicts rain down on anne, `guilty, guilty, guilty', going round the courtroom, until they reach the duke of norfolk. anne meets the eyes of her uncle..}
<C>__{norfolk}
<P>__{(unflinching)}
<D>__{guilty. norfolk stares at anne. not a hint of compassion..}
