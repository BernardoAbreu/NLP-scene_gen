<L>__{exterior river embankment, paris night}
<A>__{valjean, crusted with slime, heaves marius out of the sewer onto the embankment that runs beside the river. he looks up. there, staring at him, is javert. valjean rises slowly. heaves marius up onto his back once more. the strain of the night is showing. he's a man near the end of his strength.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{it's you, javert! i knew you wouldn't wait too long. the faithful servant at his post once more. this man's done no wrong. and he needs his family's care.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{i warned you i would not give in! i won't be swayed!}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{another hour yet and then i'm yours and all our debts are paid.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{the man of mercy comes again and talks of justice!}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{come, time is running short look down, javert! he's standing in his grave!}
<A>__{he starts to move past javert. javert draws his pistol and holds it to valjean's head.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{one more step and you die.}
<A>__{valjean meets his eyes. that old battle of will against will.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{then i die.}
<A>__{he starts walking past javert. javert's hand trembles as it holds the pistol. valjean keeps walking. javert wills himself to shoot, but he just can't do it. frustrated, enraged with himself, he lowers the gun.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{take him, valjean, before i change my mind! i will be waiting... 24601!}
<A>__{he turns away, trembling now all up and down his body. he stares into the river. valjean is gone now. he's alone.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{who is this man? what sort of devil is he? to have caught me in a trap and choose to let me go free? it was his hour at last to put a seal on my fate wipe out the past and wash me clean off the slate! all it would take was a flick of his knife vengeance was his and he gave me back my life!}
<A>__{he begins to move away along the embankment, up steps, towards a bridge. he's unaware of everything except the turmoil in his brain.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{damned if i live in the debt of a thief! damned if i yield at the end of the chase!}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{javert }
<D>__{i am the law and the law is not mocked! i will spit his pity right back in his face! there is nothing on earth that we share! it is either valjean or javert! how can i allow this man to hold dominion over me? this desperate man that i have hunted... he gave me my life! he gave me freedom! i should have perished by his hand it was his right... it was my right to die as well... instead i live... but live in hell!}
<A>__{he moves up from the embankment onto the bridge. here he stands, looking down at the dark water of the night river. the seine forms a whirlpool here, where violent currents swirl round the piles of the bridge.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{and my thoughts fly apart can this man be believed? shall his sins be forgiven? shall his crimes be reprieved? and must i now begin to doubt who never doubted all those years? my heart is stone and still it trembles... the world i have known is lost in shadow is he from heaven or from hell? and does he know that granting me my life today this man has killed me even so?}
<A>__{he climbs up onto the parapet, reaching his arms up to the night sky.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{i am reaching but i fall and the stars are black and cold as i stare into the void of a world that cannot hold... i will escape now from that world from the world of jean valjean this is nowhere i can turn... there is no way to go on...}
<A>__{he reaches higher, turning his body, twisting, as if he wants some angel from on high to save him and so, turning, he falls into the river. the swirling eddies close over him. and he's lost.}
