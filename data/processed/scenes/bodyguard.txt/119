<A>__{rachel and portman are still locked in the clinch. realizing what she's doing, rachel suddenly pulls back, catching herself.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm not doing this.}
<C>__{portman}
<P>__{(still holding her)}
<D>__{i think you are.}
<A>__{she steps out of his embrace.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i said i was grateful. thank you and good night.}
<A>__{she looks to the door that leads back to the party. the sounds of celebration continue outside. she starts to cross to the door.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(cool)}
<D>__{please go now.}
<A>__{portman moves toward her as she opens the door, reaching for her arm. then he sees, through the doorway, tony standing in the hall talking to a woman. tony looks up at the sound of the door and sees them both. rachel slips quickly out of portman's grip.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{mr. portman was just leaving us, tony.}
<A>__{portman hesitates, then smiles at rachel and tony and, with a quick peck on rachel's cheek, slips past them back to the party. rachel briefly scans the party crowd over tony's shoulder but she doesn't see frank. the door closes, leaving her alone in the room again. she reaches for a bottle of scotch and raises it to her mouth, drinking straight from the bottle.}
