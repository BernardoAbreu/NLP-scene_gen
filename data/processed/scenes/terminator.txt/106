<A>__{running. explosions light the ruins like flashbulbs. energy weapons criss cross the night like tracers. low angle, up past the burning h k as its flying counter part, an aerial h k, arcs into view with a turbojet whine. reese hauls two survivors of his unit into a personnel carrier, a chevy camaro with steel plate welded over it and the roof cut away to access the 50 caliber machine gun. it's stripped and rusted and bullet riddled, glassless. the tires are off road and very gnarly. they're driving through the ruins, up and over and through. reese drives like a demon. under other circumstances it would be considered insane. here it is merely very good. the machine gun chatters. a black shape descends, a demon with searchlights.}

<A>__{reese's car flips like a kicked beer can, rolling and crumpling. he's pinned in the wreck, bloody, screaming despite his training. the only other survivor, an emaciated boy of twelve, is pulling for all he's worth to drag reese out before it burns.}
