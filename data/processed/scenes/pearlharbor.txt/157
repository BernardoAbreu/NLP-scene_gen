<L>__{exterior air base day}
<A>__{danny blasts through the main gate; the guards are too busy taking cover and haven't even closed the barrier. he races to the tarmac, where some of the planes are still undamaged. rafe is out the door before the car stops rolling, and danny's right behind him. they're running toward a cluster of fighters, when it goes up with a bomb blast. rafe and danny dive at each other; their first instinct is to cover their best friend with their own bodies. they look at each other on the ground. they see machine gun bullets thudding into the planes on the flight line, and ripping along the walls of the buildings. it's as if the whole japanese airforce is attacking this one base, and not leaving a single plane airworthy.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{get me into a plane!}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{danny sprints; rafe follows. danny reaches a phone booth, and digs a dime from his pants.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{you're making a phone call?!}
<A>__{danny dials, as waves of bullets sweep the area, and more planes blow up on the flight line. rafe thinks he's lost his mind.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{this is walker! we're under attack! get those planes fueled and armed right now!}
<A>__{he runs back toward the car; rafe, in the nonsense of battle, reaches in to hang up the receiver, before danny grabs him and leads him on a sprint to the car, as the phone booth shatters behind them from the strafing. on the way to the car they dive back to the ground to avoid strafing and see their friends lying nearby, in shock.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{they got billy.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{come with us!}
<A>__{he and rafe jump up and run again. anthony, red, and several other pilots reach the buick and dive in. danny drives away, through the strafing.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{where are we going?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{auxiliary field at haleiwa, ten miles north of here.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{what's there?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{six p 40's.}
<A>__{as the zero pilots see the buick moving, they go after it. danny drives like a madman through the strafing, zigzagging and gunning the buick's v 8.}
