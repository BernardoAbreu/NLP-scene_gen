<L>__{interior cockpit day}
<A>__{whip is now passed out in the seat next to evans. he has two approach plates (charts) folded and tucked between his sunglasses and eyes, creating a makeshift sleeping mask. his lower jaw hangs open as his head bobs in deep sleep. margaret leans in through the cockpit door talking to evans.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{how long has sleeping beauty been out?}
<A>__{evans maintains a military posture as he monitors the plane's progress. the flight is smooth and the sky appears clear.}
<C>__{evans}
<P>__{(looks at his watch)}
<D>__{26 minutes. we're going to start descending any second now.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{well, i guess you'll need to wake...}
<A>__{the radio interrupts...}
<C>__{atc}
<D>__{southjet 227, atlanta center. descend and maintain flight level 30 thousand.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{descend and maintain 30 thousand.}
<A>__{evans dials 30,000 into the auto pilot, but just as he rolls the thumb switch to the "descend" position... bang! the plane suddenly pitches sideways instantly the autopilot's shut off sounds. whip jolts awake and pushes up his sleeping "shades."}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{the fuck was that?}
<A>__{evans grabs his yoke and pulls.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{the stabilizer feels really stiff.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{don't force it.}
<A>__{evans does, we hear a big mechanical snap.}
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(referring to the noise)}
<D>__{that came from the back!}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{i have very little trim control sir.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{margaret, get everybody strapped in tight.}
<A>__{margaret runs to the pa, leaving the cockpit door open.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{it's pulling right. hard!}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{shit! it's locked up, ease up on the trim don't...}
<A>__{bang! the plane pitches down violently and begins a nose}
<B>__{dive.}
<C>__{evans}
<P>__{(panic)}
<D>__{i have no trim at all!}
<A>__{the instrument panel lights up like a christmas tree a}
<B>__{warning horn blares.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{we lost our hydraulics!}
<A>__{whip pulls on his headset and keys his mic.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{center, this is southjet 227, we've lost our hydraulics...and, ah shit!}
<P>__{(to evans)}
<D>__{power. pull back the power!}
<A>__{evans pulls the throttles to idle.}
<C>__{whip }
<P>__{(into his mic)}
<D>__{...we lost hydraulics and looks like...also our horizontal stabilizer.}
<C>__{atc}
<D>__{southjet 227, atlanta center. understand you've lost hydraulics and stabilizer?}
<C>__{whip}
<P>__{(to evans)}
<D>__{turn on the back up pumps!}
<A>__{evans engages the emergency hydraulic pumps.}
<C>__{whip }
<P>__{(into mic)}
<D>__{center, that's affirm. we are in a descent, an uncontrolled... whoooaaaaa!!!!}
<A>__{the plane starts to bank to the right, whip puts his hand against the wing window to stay in his seat. evans grabs his harness with both hands. the passengers shriek with terror.}
<C>__{atc}
<D>__{southjet 227, do you wish to declare an emergency!?}
<A>__{margaret stumbles into the cockpit.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{everyone's belted in. are we going down?}
<A>__{the plane suddenly pitches up, begins to roll, and dives again.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{get belted in, everyone belt in. brace position!}
<A>__{margaret rushes to the bench in the galley. whip grabs his yoke and pulls. the plane inches up.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{i've got some control on my side! my plane!}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{your plane.}
<A>__{whips keeps back pressure on his yoke.}
<C>__{evans }
<D>__{it's stiff as hell. we're pitching up. slowing a bit.}
<C>__{atc}
<D>__{southjet 227, say your condition.}
<A>__{whip continues to give orders to evans.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{we need drag. throw out everything we've got. speed brakes. gear...}
<P>__{(keys his mic)}
<D>__{uh, center we're in a dive...lost vertical control.}
<C>__{atc}
<D>__{southjet 227, roger.}
<A>__{evans deploys the landing gear and applies the speed brakes. the wind roars as the gear doors drop. the airframe shakes and rumbles violently.}
<C>__{whip}
<P>__{(to evans)}
<D>__{...there enough hydraulics to drop the gear?}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{gear's down. i don't think hydraulics is the problem.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{throw out the flaps.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{too fast for flaps.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{we need to start dumping fuel.}
<A>__{evans hesitates.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{do it!}
<A>__{evans quickly throws the "emrg fuel dump" switch. the airplane bucks and drops violently a chorus of terrified screams erupts from the main cabin. whip pulls on his yoke with all of his strength and the dive shallows out a bit.}
<C>__{atc}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{southjet 227, atlanta center. how do you hear?}
<C>__{whip}
<P>__{(keys his mic)}
<D>__{atlanta. this is southjet 227. we are in an uncontrolled dive, descending out of...shit i don't know...}
<C>__{evans}
<P>__{(calls to whip)}
<D>__{21 thousand!}
<C>__{whip}
<P>__{(into his mic)}
<D>__{...21 thousand. we are declaring an emergency! we are dumping fuel! we have a jammed stabilizer...or something. we need a block of altitude to work the problem...and a heading to the nearest airport!}
<P>__{(yells to evans)}
<D>__{i'm starting to lose it!}
<A>__{the yoke pressure pulls whip hard against his harness.}
<C>__{atc}
<D>__{southjet 227. hartsfield jackson international is 10 o'clock and 20 miles from your present position. maintain block altitude, flight level 10 thousand through flight level 20 thousand. turn left heading 260.}
<C>__{whip}
<P>__{(keys mic)}
<D>__{260...we'll do our best.}
<P>__{(to evans)}
<D>__{it's getting away from me! i can't hold...dump the flaps!}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{we're still fast.}
<A>__{the yoke is ripping away from whip's hands.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{do it! 30 percent!}
<A>__{evans dumps in the flaps. the jr 88 slows dramatically and balloons up.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{that bought us a little time. we need to revert to manual control. your side first, pul...}
<A>__{whip is interrupted by the radio.}
<C>__{atc}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{southjet 227, atlanta. fuel dump is approved.}
<C>__{whip}
<P>__{(keys mic)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{evans is confused and panicked, he throws his hands up.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{evans, look at me! manual reversion. red lever, on the floor, far side of the console.}
<A>__{evans sees it.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{i got it.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{pull it up, turn it clockwise, push it back down.}
<A>__{evans does exactly that, then pulls back on his yoke nothing!}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{nothing! no control!}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{goddamn it!!}
<A>__{once again, the plane pitches into a dive. whip strains to hold on.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{i can't let go! can you reach mine?}
<A>__{evans strains to reach whip's reversion pull handle but can't.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{i can't reach it.}
<A>__{evans moves to release his harness, but whip stops him.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{no! don't! stay strapped in!}
<P>__{(calls over his shoulder)}
<D>__{margaret! margaret!}
<A>__{margaret tumbles into the cockpit, catching herself on whip's chair. she's crying.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{oh god, whip. what's happening?!}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{get strapped into the jump seat. i need your help.}
<A>__{margaret opens the jump seat and starts to pull on her harness. throughout the scene she is struggling with her harness.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{margaret, see that red lever on the floor next to my chair? the one that says, manual control?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{on the count of three you pull it up, turn it clockwise, then push it back down. ok? you ready?}
<A>__{with tears streaming down her cheeks, she gives whip a brave nod.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{here we go. one, two...}
<A>__{whip releases back pressure from his yoke, pushing it forward the plane noses downward 20 degrees!}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{...three!}
<A>__{more terrified shrieks come from the back. margaret quickly disengages then re engages the large red handle. whip pulls back on his yoke. the plane pitches up.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{ok. ok. we got something. it's still stiff as hell. evans, put in some power!}
<A>__{evans pushes up the throttles. whip gingerly applies pressure to his stick. his face fills with worry.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{i don't know. it feels like the son of a bitch wants to nose over.}
<A>__{then suddenly... whap! whip's yoke flies out of his hands and slams forward! the plane banks right and drops! margaret screams!}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{shit! power back!}
<P>__{(he pulls back the power)}
<D>__{i can't fucking believe this!}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{oh no!}
<A>__{now, atc comes on the radio...}
<C>__{atc}
<D>__{southjet 227, hartsfield jackson is eleven o'clock and niner miles. i see you below 10,000. how are you doing?}
<C>__{whip}
<P>__{(keys his mic)}
<D>__{not good. you got anything closer? we're in a rapid dive here...}
<C>__{atc}
<D>__{roger, southjet 227. uh...clayton county is 2 miles at your 4 o'clock.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{negative. we're too high...we can't pitch for glide. we have no stabilizer control.}
<C>__{atc}
<D>__{copy, southjet 227.}
<A>__{the plane continues to drop, increasing its nose down attitude and speed. whip pushes both of his feet forward, stretching his body to get leverage as we can see him pulling on the yoke, trying to get the plane out of the dive it's in. evans is starting to lose it.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{oh lord, we're descending at 4,700 feet per minute, out of 7,000. i see nothing but houses!}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{ok! here's what we're going to do!}
<P>__{(to evans)}
<D>__{when i say, you retract the gear, retract the flaps and trim both ailerons. but every things gonna be opposite, so be sure to trim down. margaret...}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{trim down?! what are you gonna do?!}
<A>__{whip takes margaret's hand and puts it on the throttle levers.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{when i ask for power, push both of these forward. got it?}
<P>__{(margaret nods)}
<D>__{what's your son's name?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{trevor.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{say "i love you trevor."}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{you mean trim up?! right? you want me to trim up?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{the black box.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i love you trevor. be a good boy. mommy loves you.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{what are we doing?! why would i trim down?!}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{we're gonna roll it. ready? here we go. i've got control.}
<C>__{evans}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{what! what do you mean, roll it?!!}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{just a little barrel roll. don't panic. relax. let it roll.}
<A>__{whip's body is fully extended as he pulls back on the yoke and turns into a steep bank.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{evans, flaps!}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{flaps up!}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{margaret full power! evans, trim us! gear up!}
<A>__{the g force of the roll presses evans away from the console.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{i can't reach the gear!}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{margaret! can you reach it?}
<A>__{margaret bends forward and pulls the lever.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{what's our altitude?}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{3,000...i think.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{let it roll. i got it!}
<A>__{whip quickly retracts the speed brakes, then pushes his yoke full forward! the clumsy liner does a slow, ungraceful roll.}
