<A>__{steadying his binoculars, while childs drives, spots something up ahead. the vehicles slow down and come to a halt. something lies just ahead of them in the whiteness, in the middle of the dog tracks.}
<B>__{the men}
<A>__{kneel down by the "something." it is the half eaten remains of a dog. its hind legs and lower stomach picked clean. its ripped hide, flapping in the wind. its top half missing.}

<C>__{childs}
