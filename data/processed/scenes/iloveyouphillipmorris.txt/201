<D>__{don't.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{no response. phillip can only sit and stew. and stew. until finally, he's had enough.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{from the moment we met, you've done nothing but lie. our whole relationship... just lies. i'm such an asshole. you took advantage of me just like all the rest of them. you were supposed to protect me but you've done nothing but make a fool of me. and you expect me to love you? how can i love you? i don't even know who you are. and you know what's sad? i don't even think you know who you are. so how am i supposed to love something that don't even exist? you tell me.}
<A>__{eventually a policeman stands before phillip.}

<A>__{before he stands up, phillip manages a terse statement.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{i will never forgive you steven. never.}
<A>__{steven is speechless as he watches phillip walk away disappearing down a long corridor.}
