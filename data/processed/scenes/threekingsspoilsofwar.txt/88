<L>__{exterior mesa later}
<A>__{wes, epps and jaeger are making the trek back down. jaeger is shouldering the pack with the gold. wes has got his m 16. epps stops, and puts his pack down. he takes out the navicom and a recon photo.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we should head northeast.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{northeast? that's away from the hummer; further into iraqi.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{there's another pass on the photo. we can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{it should, or it will? least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it. we're heading northeast.}
<A>__{really calm, cold and direct wes says:}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you've got an awful lot of orders in you. always giving orders.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i out rank you, that's why.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{in the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. way i see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.}
<A>__{epps loads up his pack pretty much ignoring wes.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we been down this road. i told you how it is. unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what if i do?}
<A>__{epps says nothing, so wes tries it again a little harder.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what if i do?}
<A>__{he works the action of his m 16.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you talk loud, and don't even have a big stick to back it up with.}
<A>__{real casual epps takes a grenade from his belt and flips the pin loose. he stands with the grenade in one hand and the navicom in the other. real calm, like he was talking about the weather:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{something happens to me i let go of this grenade. i go, and i take the navicom with me. and how do you suppose you're going to find your way back to the hummer, when you won't even know what's up or down. it's a big country, and you could be heading for the allies, or wandering right into bhagdad. that's if you don't die of thirst before you even get that far. how you like my stick now?}
<A>__{epps and wes have a stare down. jaeger, who's getting really good at freaking out, jumps in.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{why don't you put the gun down, all right, wes? you put the gun down and epps'll put the pin back in the grenade. won't you epps?}
<A>__{the stare down goes on a beat longer. finally wes lowers his rifle. he turns to jaeger and vents what anger he can.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i'm starting to think you're a real bitch, you know that?}
