<A>__{the house is very dark and quiet. jeffrey finds a note by the one table light is on. the note is from his mother. it reads, "jeffrey hope you enjoyed yourself. see you at breakfast. love mom." a postscript is written on the note by aunt barbara. "jeffrey, honey, i found these. love, aunt barbara." jeffrey sees that aunt barbara has left him two dead termites. he picks one up and studies it. again we see a huge closeup of a termite in the half light. jeffrey shakes his head in amusement.}
