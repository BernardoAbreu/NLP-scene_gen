<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{the room has suddenly become ominously quiet, the only sound being george's labored breathing. george goes over to a corner of the room where his workshop is set up a drawing table, several models of modern buildings, bridges, etc. savagely he kicks over the models, picks up some books and hurls them into the corner. mary and the children watch, horrified. george looks around and sees them staring at him as if he were some unknown wild animal. the three children are crying.}
