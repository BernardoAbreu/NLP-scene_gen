<A>__{the cultists bare meagan's arm and inject her with dream dope. she takes her place at the threshold beside freddy.}
<L>__{exterior religious tv station same time}
<A>__{as the battle outside between the cultists and the cops rages, murdoch and the s.w.a.t. commander squat down behind a fender to reload.}
<C>__{s.w.a.t. commander}
<D>__{well, it doesn't look like they're going to surrender.}
<C>__{murdoch}
<D>__{what we're going to need then is somebody to charge their lines make a hole for us to slip in.}
<C>__{s.w.a.t. commander}
<D>__{where are you going to find anyone that crazy?}
<A>__{just then, an ambulance comes roaring through the police lines, causing the cops to scurry like mice.}
<C>__{murdoch}
<D>__{here comes one now...}
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{go git 'em, son!}
<A>__{murdoch squints to see who's driving... it's jason! erwin smiles and waves to murdoch through the passenger side window as the ambulance zooms past. murdoch curses, drawing his pistol and shooting after the ambulance. the other cops join in a moment later, bullet hits sparking off the back of the ambulance as it crashes through the front gate. inside the ambulance, erwin hazards a glance back at the cops, then he turns to jason and says:}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{that was easy enough...}
<A>__{erwin looks ahead and screams. angle through windshield as three cultists stand directly in front of the speeding ambulance, firing machine guns. the glass explodes just as erwin ducks down. two cultists suddenly scatter as jason rams the ambulance into the middle one just before plowing into the side of the station with a crash. erwin pushes down his airbag just in time to see a cultist closing in with a gun. he reaches through the smashed windshield and grabs the squashed cultist's machine gun laying on the hood. erwin turns, shoots the cultist just in time. as jason kicks open the driver's side door he is greeted by two cultists shooting at him. jason rips off the driver's side door and hurls it at the two punks, knocking them down like bowling pins. then jason reaches back into the ambulance, pulls out the jaws of life and, with erwin covering his back, starts towards the front door.}
