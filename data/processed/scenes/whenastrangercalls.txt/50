<A>__{he steps into the hall. tracy closes the front door and bolts it. she turns, leans against it and sighs. outside the door, duncan's footsteps move down the hall, pause, then come back to the door. a moment passes. then there is a faint knocking on the door. tracy doesn't move. the knocking comes again, a little louder this time. tracy stands and waits, scarcely breathing. after another long moment, the footsteps finally move away.}
