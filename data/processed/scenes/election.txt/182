<A>__{jim approaches the microphone}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{if we could get started. people! once the winners are announced, we can all go home, okay?}
<A>__{the students quiet down}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{some contests are so well fought that is seems unfair for someone to win and someone to lose. i think that's the case with all the candidates you see before you today. all of them are highly qualified and embody the, uh, the integrity we expect from our school leadership.}
<A>__{os tracy jim's voice momentarily recedes.}
<C>__{tracy }
<D>__{act surprised. walk slowly to the podium. be modest. thank them for this incredible honor.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done. we'll begin with president.}
<A>__{jim pulls a folded paper from his back pocket}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{let me add that this was an extraordinarily close race. it's my pleasure to announce the next president of millard high school.}
<A>__{tracy just can't wait. smiling, she stands up.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{paul metzier!}
<A>__{the crowd breaks into applause and laughter on tracy as she sits, her smile belies her horror and humiliation paul begins his acceptance speech. we cut alternately to a thrilled lisa; a stunned tracy, tears forming at the corners of her eyes; and to jim, who watches the events with shifty eyes, his mouth dry and tasting of metal.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{geez, you guys, thanks a lot. i mean, wow, thanks. i promise to do my best and really do a good job and be a good president. and i want to thank lisa flanagan for being a super campaign manager. and i just want to say that i think tracy would have made a great president too and that she really deserves a big hand.}
<A>__{the auditorium erupts into applause and whistles, and jim takes the microphone again.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{and now, for vice president.}
