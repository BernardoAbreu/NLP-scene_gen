<L>__{exterior range of low hills south vietnam day}
<A>__{as the rockets streak away the lightened choppers shoot upward, lost to sight. there is an eerie silence and then the hillside explodes, vanishes in a sheet of smoke and flame two miles wide.}
<L>__{exterior dusty road day}
<A>__{a platoon of americans have been ambushed on the road. the bodies lie helter skelter headless, armless, legless, guts spilled in the dirt. no one moves and there is absolute silence except for the low buzz of flies. a v.c. lieutenant steps into sight. he gives a brusque command and v.c. soldiers step out of the jungle. the lieutenant bayonets a few of the fallen u.s. soldiers idly, without much interest and then cracks a joke as he rubs his finger in the americans' blood. the v.c. soldiers laugh, spear a few americans themselves and repeat the joke. there is a slight sound. the v.c. lieutenant spins and gives a low command. fifty feet away there are three grass huts. he signals his soldiers to spread out and then he starts toward them.}
