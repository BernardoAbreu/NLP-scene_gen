<A>__{below us the car drives off into the empty landscape, getting smaller and smaller. then... boom. we see the flash of the explosion and the renault is flipped like a toy car. a ribbon of black smoke rises into the blue sky. silence.}

<A>__{bob's p.o.v we are stumbling forward towards a sand berm. we hear the sound of heavy breathing.}

<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{alright, c'mon...}
<A>__{he hauls bob to his feet, puts his baseball cap on him and pulls him onto his back. bob hangs there limply as lyn sets off again. lyn reaches up and gropes at bob's face, removing his spectacles. bob doesn't notice.}
