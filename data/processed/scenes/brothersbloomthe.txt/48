<L>__{exterior berlin street early morning}
<A>__{bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level. a thousand year old man sweeps up across the square. bloom sits wearily on the curb, bowler hat in hand, shirt bright red with fake blood, face long as hell. putting the broom aside a moment, the old man walks painfully across the street to bloom. standing nearly toe to toe with him, the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled face. he then smears his hand over his mug, pulling the smile off his face and rubbing it on bloom's mouth. when he takes his hand away, bloom plays along and has the same big joyful smile. the old man winks at him and walks back to his broom. as soon as the old man is away, bloom drops the smile. stephen paces out into the street.}
