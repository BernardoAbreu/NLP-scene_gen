<D>__{think he'll manage?}
<C>__{bbc news reader}
<D>__{i've heard he may not even show.}
<A>__{the floor manager tries to warn him with his eyes. bertie has entered with elizabeth and logue. the reader wishes he could sink into the floor. bertie says nothing, but approaches the looming microphone, while logue and elizabeth watch nervously.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{`walk up to the bloody thing boldly, stare it square in the eye, man to man.'}
<C>__{bbc news reader}
<P>__{(placating)}
<D>__{if you'll be so kind, to let me show you...}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i already know. my father taught me.}
<A>__{he spreads the fingers of one hand, touches the apparatus with the little finger, thumb to chin. the reader scurries off and tells the others.}
<C>__{bbc news reader}
<D>__{his father taught him. i taught his father.}
<C>__{bertie}
<P>__{(testing the microphone)}

<C>__{lionel}
<P>__{(lighty...yet seriously)}
<D>__{i've always wanted to be knighted.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{sorry. that would raise too many questions.}
<C>__{lionel}
<P>__{(pause, then)}
<D>__{understood.}
<A>__{bertie takes something from his pocket.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{your shilling. told you i'd give it back.}

<D>__{keep it for good luck.}
<C>__{bertie}

<D>__{my greatest honour, bertie.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{one final question.}
<C>__{bertie}

<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{do you believe you're king?}
<A>__{a very long pause.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{almost.}
<A>__{the red light on the microphone starts to blink. logue joins the others. the reader is at a smaller microphone near the ad hoc `broadcast booth. five, four, three, two...}
<C>__{bbc news reader}
<D>__{good evening, this is the bbc national and world programme, broadcasting from buckingham palace. his majesty, the king.}
<A>__{during this, bertie's hands begin to shake, the pages of his speech rattle like dry leaves, his throat muscles constrict, the adam's apple bulges, his lips tighten...all the old symptoms reappear. several seconds have elapsed since the reader finished. it seems an eternity. elizabeth grasps the sides of her chair with white knuckles. lang's eyes roll heavenward. churchill studies the situation, ready to leap into the breach. bertie and logue stare at each other. logue smiles, perfectly calm, totally confident in the man he's worked with. his confidence is contagious. bertie takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. his hands grow steady, his throat muscles relax...all the things he's practiced.}
