<A>__{bess curtseys before elizabeth; who shakes her head at her.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{late again, bess.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{i beg your majesty's forgiveness.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{given. once.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{the puddle man is outside, majesty.}
<A>__{elizabeth takes bess's arm and turns with her to the portraits.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{my suitors.}
<A>__{the courtier has a fourth portrait.}

<D>__{a cousin of philip ii of spain.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{he's rather sweet.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{more your age than mine, bess. how old is he?}
<C>__{hatton}
<D>__{young... i believe, majesty. an austrian alliance would keep france quiet.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{and it would put philip on a leash.}
<A>__{elizabeth looks across at the spaniards.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i become almost enthusiastic.}
<P>__{to hatton)}
<D>__{send for him.}

<P>__{(to walsingham)}
<D>__{how much longer do you think i can play this game?}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{virginity is an asset that holds its value well.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{diplomatically speaking.}
<A>__{raleigh now enters with calley, the native americans and court servants carrying hampers. one of the spaniards recognises him and murmurs to the ambassador; who speaks angrily to the queen.}
<C>__{don guerau}
<D>__{majesty, this man is a notorious pirate.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{indeed?}
<A>__{don guerau points to the hampers.}
<C>__{don guerau}
<D>__{spanish treasure, stolen from spanish ships. you will see.}
<A>__{raleigh kneels before the queen. elizabeth gestures for him to rise.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{well, sir. who are you?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{walter raleigh, your majesty.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{ah, yes. raleigh. i've heard of your voyage. what's your rank?}

<D>__{a gentleman of devon.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{the honour to be in the presence of my queen, whose radiant beauty is the boast and glory of the english people.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{yes, well, here you are.}
<C>__{aleigh}
<D>__{i'm just returned from the new world, majesty. i have claimed the fertile coast in your name, and called it virginia, in honour of our virgin queen.}
<A>__{elizabeth raises her eyebrows.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{virginia? and if i marry? will you change the name to conjugia?}
<A>__{a royal joke. her entourage laughs dutifully.}
<P>__{(}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{i ask for your gracious permission, majesty, to return to the new world with your royal warrant, to found a colony under the laws and protections of england.}
<A>__{elizabeth's eye has fallen on the native americans.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{who are they?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{americans, majesty. they long to be your newest subjects.}
<A>__{he beckons calley to lead wanchese and manteo forward.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{have they no ruler of their own?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{none to match england's queen.}
<A>__{elizabeth gazes at the natives. she holds out her hand. unaware that he's meant to kiss the queen's hand, manteo, takes it and shakes it. a gasp from the watching courtiers. but elizabeth accepts the courtesy.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{these gentlemen are welcome. see that they're treated well.}
<A>__{calley hurries them away before worse happens.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{i also come bearing gifts for your majesty, from the new world.}
<A>__{he beckons to the servants to bring the baskets. don guerau steps forward.}
<C>__{don guerau}

<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{let's see, shall we?}
<P>__{to raleigh)}
<D>__{what do you bring me?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{mud, and leaves.}
<A>__{members of the court share suppressed smiles.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{mud and leaves?}
<A>__{aleigh throws open the first basket. don guerau peers inside suspiciously. it does indeed seem to be filled with mud. raleigh takes out a potato beneath the ambassador's nose.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{patata, majesty. you eat it. very nourishing.}
<A>__{he beckons forward the second basket, which is full of leaves. again don guerau tracks his every move. he takes out a tobacco leaf. r}
<C>__{aleigh}
<D>__{tobacco. you breathe its smoke. very stimulating.}
<A>__{now don guerau realises he's being laughed at on all sides. he draws himself up with angry pride, wrinkling his nose.}
<C>__{don guerau}
<D>__{forgive me, majesty, i find the air has become stale. i am sensitive to the smell of open sewers.}
<A>__{a glare at raleigh, a bow for the queen, and don guerau leads his spaniards out.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(to raleigh)}
<D>__{continue.}
<A>__{with a broad smile, raleigh gestures forward the third basket. this one really is full of gold. he takes out a gold coin and presents it to elizabeth.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{gold. you spend it. very satisfying.}
<A>__{elizabeth examines the fat gold coin, with its image of philip of spain. she tries not to smile.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{courtesy of a spanish ship, that found itself unable to complete its journey.}
<A>__{elizabeth drops the gold coin back into the basket.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{the fruits of piracy after all, it seems.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{philip of spain is no friend of england, majesty. the more gold i take from him, the safer you will be.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{well, well. a political pirate. a logic chopping pirate.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{and your majesty's most loyal subject.}
<A>__{she gives him a long look.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{but not my best dressed.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{welcome home, mr raleigh.}
<A>__{she turns her attention back to hatton and the portraits. raleigh bows and withdraws, followed by his men. walsingham follows.}
