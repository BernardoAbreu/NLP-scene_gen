<L>__{exterior french road day}
<A>__{miller and his men walk along the road. the men are silent, grim.}
<L>__{exterior french path day}
<A>__{miller checks his map. figures out where they are. folds up the map, points the way and they move out.}
<L>__{exterior french field day}
<A>__{more progress. the men are still grim.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{you know what the best possible thing that could happen is?}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.}
<A>__{miller laughs. miller i will bite, reiben.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{i've given this a lot of thought, sir. the best thing that could happen is, we find ryan and he's dead.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{well, sir, consider the possibilities. a: ryan is alive. we have to take him back to the beach. knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{except for the last part, that one's not bad.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{b: ryan is dead. he's been blown up by the german equivalent of wade, whose name i know you don't want me to mention. there's nothing to find. the biggest piece is the size of a pea. we wander around, looking for him until the germans pick us off, one after another.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i don't like that one.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{neither do i, sir. c: and this is the worst one, we find ryan and he's wounded. not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. and him.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{but we accomplish the mission.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{maybe. but what if he dies on the way back? you see what i'm saying, sir? the best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog tags and high tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to caen and catch up with division.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{that's a mystery to me.}
<A>__{no one smiles, but they trudge a bit less.}
