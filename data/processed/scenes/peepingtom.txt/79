<D>__{yes, viv...}
<A>__{he peers into the viewfinder. in the finder we see vivian looking rather pathetically into camera.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{mark i hope i won't let you down... i know you're trying to create atmosphere for me but... i just don't feel frightened! wouldn't it be better if i just did my number?}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(shaking head)}
<D>__{later.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{oh all right! i could do anything i feel so relaxed and that's due to you... you're so at home with that camera you make me feel at home too... you have it in you, boy!}

<D>__{set the mood for me, mark...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well...}
<A>__{he goes and switches off the recorder. the sudden silence is startling.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{imagine someone... coming towards you... who's going to kill you regardless of consequences...}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{a madman?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes but he knows it... and you don't... and just to kill you... isn't enough for him.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{but how would he frighten me to?}
<A>__{she stares into focusing screen intrigued, but not frightened, not even by the silence and shadowy vastness around her.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{stay there, viv... you're... just right.}
<A>__{she stands motionless staring into camera.}
