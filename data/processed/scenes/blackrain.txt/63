<L>__{exterior printing plant day}
<A>__{ich, nick, and charlie are threading their way through the crowd toward the subway entrance. two bikers, their hair slicked back, watch the trio from the top of two different subway entrances. as soon as ich, nick and charlie go down the steps, they climb off their bikes and follow.}
<L>__{interior subway station}
<A>__{nick, ich and charlie are riding the people mover that stretches the length of this endless tunnel. they're sandwiched between the legions of salarymen (white collar workers) who all wear identical blue suits and white shirts. nick looks over at ich, who is still suffering in silence from the recent humiliation.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you know, inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.}
<C>__{ich}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't deserve ohashi's respect.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{why the hell not?}
<C>__{ich}
<D>__{i don't, that's all.}
<A>__{ich looks away, obviously uncomfortable.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you cool, ich?}
<C>__{ich}
<D>__{cool?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you all right? you okay?}
<A>__{ich nods.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what does ichiro mean, anyway?}
<C>__{ich}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{what does charlie mean?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey, all right.}
<A>__{charlie slaps ich on the back. nick smiles at charlie's remark. he can't help but like this wide eyed goofy kid. something makes nick's smile fade. nick's pov kobo, their escaped prisoner, hurrying in the opposite direction. his kamali suit looks like it just came from the cleaners.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{charlie!}
<A>__{charlie spots him. in a flash, the two men jump the railing and charge after him, leaving ich in their wake. ich can't possibly make it over the side. he furiously shoves his way through the salarymen, trying to get to the end of the walkway.}
<B>__{chase sequence}
<A>__{ nick barreling through the mass of faceless salarymen. kobo, hurrying ahead, occasionally glancing back. charlie catching up to nick. they've lost him. they spin around. a half dozen tunnels spin out in all directions. nick and charlie spotting kobo. he's waiting for them near the turnstile. nick suddenly realizes it's a set up. before he can say anything, charlie sprints ahead, recklessly shoving people out of the way.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(calling after him)}
<D>__{it's a set up...! charlie!}
<A>__{charlie hasn't heard him.}
<B>__{at the turnstile}
<A>__{kobo hands a ticket to the turnstile guard and disappears onto the platform. charlie doesn't have a ticket. the guard points to the automatic ticket machine. screw it. charlie leaps over the turnstile. the guard blows his shrill whistle to signal the subway police.}
<B>__{the platform}
<A>__{charlie pushes through the crowd a wall of blank faces. kobo is gone.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{shoving through the crowd. he spots charlie. shouts at him to wait. charlie can't hear his partner.}
<B>__{the subway}
<A>__{pulls in. an immaculately uniformed conductor blows his whistle and waves his white gloved hands to keep the crowd back. a leather jacketed boy shoves charlie from behind; he stumbles forward toward the track. someone catches him at the last moment. charlie turns around to see it's kobo. kobo smiles, it's all a big joke. what follows happens in a flash:}
<B>__{on nick}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{charlie!}
<A>__{nick is close enough to see, too far to do anything. he's blocked by two more leather boys. he tries to shove past, but they grab him.}
<B>__{kobo}
<A>__{holding charlie by his coat lapels. an express train tears into the station. kobo casually glances at}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{trying to struggle free.}
<B>__{kobo}
<A>__{his eyes still on nick, drops charlie in front of the speeding express as if he were a sack of laundry.}
<B>__{nick}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no!!}
<A>__{a woman screams. the train barrels through the station. kobo starts toward nick. he's nexterior a pair of subway policemen burst through the crowd searching for charlie because he vaulted the turnstile.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{manages to break free of the leatherboys holding him. they flee into the crowd as the police close in. across the platform kobo slips into the wave of commuters being shoved into a train by white gloved men. it's their job to shove commuters into the already packed cars. nick goes for kobo, but the crowd closes in front of him. he can't get through.}
<B>__{the subway doors}
<A>__{slam shut. the train pulls out leaving nick standing on the empty platform.}
<B>__{the last car}
<A>__{streaks past him. kobo stands in the rear window, getting smaller and smaller until the train disappears down the tracks.}
<C>__{ich}
<D>__{nick!}
<A>__{ich, out of breath, is standing on the platform. nick looks at him with disgust where the hell was he. stay on nick, his head bowed, being surrounded by the sea of blue suited commuters.}
