<A>__{radburn brings food in to solomon; a shriveled piece of meat and some water. just barely enough to sustain solomon. radburn also has a shirt.}
<C>__{radburn}
<D>__{that old thing of yours is just rags and tatters. need something proper to wear.}
<A>__{solomon doesn't move for the clothing.}
<C>__{radburn }
<D>__{go'won. put it on.}
<A>__{with slow defiance, solomon does as instructed. he removes what remains of his old shirt the one he was wearing when first kidnapped and puts on the one radburn brought him. the shirt's ill fitting and dirty. despite that, radburn says:}
<C>__{radburn }
<D>__{there. tha's fine. tha's fine. got no gratitude?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{...thank you...}
<C>__{radburn}
<D>__{yah keep bein' proper, yah'll see how things work out.}
<A>__{radburn starts to take the old shirt.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{no! it was from my wife.}
<C>__{radburn}
<D>__{rags and tatters. rags and tatters.}
<A>__{taking the shirt, the "rags and tatters" as he calls them, radburn exits, locking the door behind him. solomon sits with the plate of food before him. he pushes the plate away rather than eat.}
