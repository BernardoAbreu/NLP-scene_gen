<A>__{john and nadia sit opposite each other. she takes a mouthful. they catch one another's eye. and again. on the wall across, six ants careen in crazy circles. john can see them, but doesn't move. he puts his fork down.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't know what to say. your letters were in english. good english. you said you'd studied english.}
<A>__{nadia reaches down into her bag and pulls out a small box wrapped in brown paper. she places it in front of him. he warily unwraps a little wooden box. he opens the lid and fishes out a simple gold ring. he holds it in his palm.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i can't take this.}
<A>__{he puts it back in the box, hoping it will disappear. she fishes it out again and holds it on her palm for him to take.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i can't take it. i'm not really a ring guy.}
<A>__{she takes his hand. he automatically yanks it away like he's been burned. she takes his hand again and to stop it becoming unbearable, he allows nadia to push the ring onto his ring finger. it goes on easily.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay. no big deal. thank you. yes thanks. thank you.}
