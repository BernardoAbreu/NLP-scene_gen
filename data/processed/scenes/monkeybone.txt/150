<A>__{julie et al scream in horror as the two bodies plunge earthward. on stu bone & o.d. stu falling ...and falling and falling until they smack into the hot asphalt of the parking lot, the deflated balloon settling over them like a shroud. their bodies have stopped but their spirits keep on falling... aerial shot skies over dark town night ...and the fight continues even into the afterlife! as they plummet down through the heavens, they revert to their true personae. it's stu vs. monkeybone, creator vs. sidekick, still duking it out like a couple of skydivers fighting over a single parachute!}
