<A>__{trillian bursts to the surface. finnegan yanks her up and out of the water.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{you o.k.?}
<A>__{trillian can only nod, and gasp for breath. canton and hanover catch their breath, panting away, waterlogged. hanover reaches over to retrieve the rifle in trillian's hand. trillian points the barrel at him, and hits the safety.}

<P>__{(grim)}

<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{gone...}
<C>__{mamooli}
<D>__{this is not real! this is not bloody real!}
<A>__{finnegan topples a large, heavy metal broiler onto the open floor gate, sealing the watery hole in the floor. there are two hatches in this room. the far hatch is closed. mamooli stands next to an open hatch. canton points to it.}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{through there...another sixty, seventy yards...there are more elevators there.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{i ain't goin' up no more elevators.}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{there's stairways...}
<A>__{mamooli slams the hatch shut. eyes bugging out of his head.}
<C>__{mamooli}
<D>__{i say we stay right here!}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{are you crazy?}
<C>__{mamooli}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{there's plenty of food here. we can hold out...someone'll rescue us...}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{mamooli}
<D>__{someone...maybe they sent an sos!}
<C>__{pantucci}

<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{mamooli stand down!}
<C>__{mamooli}
<D>__{we don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw billy!}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{boat or no boat...i'm going...}
<A>__{finnegan steps forward. mamooli aims his rifle right at finnegan's head.}
<C>__{mamooli}
<D>__{they're wipin' us out one at a time. i say we make a stand. right here! right now! maximum firepower!}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{somebody shoot this jerk!}
<C>__{finnegan}
<P>__{(calm)}
<D>__{nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!}
<C>__{mamooli}
<D>__{i will kill you!! i will fucking kill you!! i will do it! i will do it! i'm not playin' around here!}
<A>__{finnegan freezes. close on: the hatch. as a black liquid starts to ooze through a tiny latch hole. no one sees it.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{i once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. the little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.}
<C>__{mamooli}
<D>__{what the hell are you talking about?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{us...i'm talking about us... we're the fish.}
<A>__{the liquid shadow oozes down and hits the floor, starts to expand, filling like a water balloon. it's not a liquid. it's a tentacle. veins, feelers and suckers begin to form.}
<C>__{mamooli}
<D>__{and what? these things are octopuses}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{i don't know what these things are ...all i know is...}
<A>__{the tentacle slowly rises up right behind mamooli. inches behind his head. finnegan and hanover see it. eyes widening.}
<C>__{mamooli}
<D>__{what...? what??}
<A>__{mamooli turns to the tentacle looming over him, about to strike.}
<C>__{mamooli }
<D>__{eeeeyyyyyaaaahhhh!!!!}
<A>__{he opens fire, emptying his clip into the tentacle. the tentacle retreats into the pipes. mamooli looks around. the room is empty. he runs out.}
