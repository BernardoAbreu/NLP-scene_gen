<A>__{simms and retch. more window frames are neatly stacked against the wall. simms and retch react as they see an angry jim blandings flap his way into scene, his varnished shoes having picked up additional paper, shavings, shingles, etc. retch hands jim a sheaf of papers.}
<C>__{retch}
<D>__{oh, mr. blandings, you'd better look these over.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what's this about the windows?}

<P>__{(calmly)}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, has he got mine?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{no, he seems to have some windows that belong to a mr. blandsworth of peekskill.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{where are my windows?!}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{as near as we can figure out they've either been sent to a mr. benton in evanston, illinois, or a mr. bamberger of phoenix, arizona.}
<A>__{bill wanders into scene, looks over jim's shoulder.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what are we supposed to do live the rest of our lives in a house without windows?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{it'll just be a matter of a few days.}

<D>__{what's a "zuz zuz water soft n r"?}

<P>__{(explosively)}
<D>__{i will not have any such piece of equipment in my house!}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{from what?!}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{rust. the plumbing man assures us the water from your well is the most corrosive in his entire experience in the trade.}
