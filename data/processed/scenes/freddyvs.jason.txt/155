<A>__{outside, the cultists surrounding the outside of the station watch as dozens of police vehicles swarm to the fence. murdoch and the s.w.a.t. commander get out of the lead car. murdoch picks up his bullhorn and says:}

<P>__{(through bullhorn)}
<D>__{this is captain renton murdoch state trooper. i'm giving you until the count of three to come out with your hands up...}
<A>__{a cultist sniper fires a shot at murdoch, the bullet hit smashing the emergency lights atop his car. the other cops duck down, but not murdoch, he turns calmly to the s.w.a.t. commander and says:}
<C>__{murdoch}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hand me that flare pistol.}
<A>__{the commander gives the flare gun to murdoch, adding:}
<C>__{s.w.a.t. commander}
<D>__{good idea. throw a little light on them see if we can spot their firing positions...}
<A>__{as the commander speaks, murdoch aims the pistol carefully and fires. phoomph! the flare streaks to the roof of the tv station, smacking the sniper. he bursts into flames and tumbles to the ground, screaming. murdoch hands the flare gun back to the commander, going back on the bullhorn and saying:}
<C>__{murdoch}
<P>__{(through bullhorn)}
<D>__{alright, now i'm through playing "nice guy" i want the rest of you punks to come out right now with your hands up.}
<A>__{the cultists respond by filling the air with hot lead bullet hits riddle the cop cars, smashing glass and piercing metal. the cops fire back, bullet hits exploding all along the sides of the tv station.}
