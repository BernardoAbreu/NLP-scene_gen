<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior bodhi's pickup predawn}
<A>__{the pickup is a funnel of dust along the desert road. black mountains against a silver sky.}
<L>__{interior bodhi's pickup}
<A>__{the tapedeck blasts. bodhi and utah sit inside the cab. through the rear window, we see nathaniel, roach and grommet in the flatbed. bodhi swivels his eyes to johnny, lowers the volume.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{life's sure got a sick sense of humor, don't you think so johnny?}
<A>__{face splitting into a shit eating grin.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{how you figure?}
<C>__{bodhi}
<P>__{(slight laugh)}
<D>__{news, last night... those guys, the ex presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday. and i was just there the day before, cashing a check. see... look. assured trust... same place.}
<A>__{he takes a beat up checkbook off the dash and flips it to johnny. utah opens the cover and looks. sure enough. assured trust savings and loan.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{i was picking up some bucks cause we're leaving town. bizarre, huh? if i'd waited a day i'd been right in the middle of it. kinda sorry i missed it. i'd liked to've seen them.}
<A>__{a long pregnant pause. utah breathes deeply, remaining calm, his voice carrying a chilling bravado.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{takes guts to rob a bank. all that adrenalin pumping, waving loaded guns, taking out the guards, getting everybody on the floor, never knowin' who's gonna burst in...}
<P>__{(looks right at bodhi)}
<D>__{... wondering what it's like to take a bullet. must be some ride.}
<A>__{utah's smile is a personal challenge. bodhi sits perversely intrigued. the mental warfare escalates.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{banks are insured, brah. long as nobody gets shot, it's really a victimless crime. just gotta scare 'em a little, would be my guess.}
<P>__{(ponders something)}
<D>__{now if i was gonna rob a bank, with all those guys wearin' body armor these days, know what i'd carry?}
<A>__{bodhi reaches his hand underneath the seat. he pulls out a huge holstered handgun, rests it in his lap, draws and holds the gun up against his cheek.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{.454 casull. most powerful handgun on the planet. muzzle velocity of 2000 feet per second. twice the kinetic energy of a .44 magnum.}
<A>__{bodhi stares at utah, then flashes his signature smile. utah says coldly.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{one shot stopping.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{'one shot stopping'... good, very good. i like you, johnny. i like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win. i respect that. it elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. here, hold it. check out the weight.}
<A>__{he twirls the gun, grabs the barrel and extends the handle to utah. johnny takes it slowly. now it's aimed at bodhi.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{whoa. careful. you got the muzzle pointing right at me, brah.}
<A>__{he casually pushes the barrel away, looking back at the highway. johnny swings a stiff arm out his window and pumps a round into open desert. kabooom!! the recoil blows johnny's arm back over the top of the truck. practically breaks his wrist. thunder rolls across the dark hills. from the back of the pickup nathaniel howls. grommet and roach high five. johnny turns to bodhi, breaking slowly into a feral grin.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{nice.}
<A>__{he hands the smoking weapon back to him. as if to say "two can play this game". bodhi stands challenged. each snared in the other's power... bodhi takes the weapon back, casually. slips it under the seat.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{it's a special day, johnny u. a very special day...}
<A>__{utah's gaze travels beyond the windshield. where tentacles of brand new morning light vein the sky.}
