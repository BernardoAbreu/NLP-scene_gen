<L>__{interior museum. origins of man exhibit later}
<A>__{adam and greg (45), adam's slightly moronic co worker, place the finishing touches on the cro magnon exhibit it's an elaborate life sized diorama depicting the life of a family of four cro magnons. outside their hut it's snowing, but inside there's a large fire and decorative horse drawings on the walls. the man instructs his son to paint as the woman teaches her daughter to sew. we see greg positioning the fossil of a velociraptor next to the mother and daughter. the dinosaur looks poised to pounce. adam notices.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{greg. what are you doing?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{it's a velociraptor.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{where did it come from?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{the dinosaur exhibit.}
<P>__{(off adam's look)}
<D>__{why can't we just say it was the first domesticated pet?...people love dinosaurs.}
<A>__{adam cringes in frustration.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{greg you can't just...that's a 75 million year old fossil...just please, put it away before someone sees it.}
<A>__{greg reluctantly goes to put the dinosaur away. he flaps the dinosaur's arm in the air waving goodbye to adam. seth leads his tour of second graders. he speaks like a tour guide at universal studios.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{coming up here on our left is the "origins of man" exhibit on loan from the smithsonian institute. it won't be open to the public for a few more months, so you're one of the first groups to see it.}
<P>__{(spots adam)}
<D>__{adam!}
<A>__{adam looks up. he hates this part of his job.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{everyone this is adam, he's the curator of ancient civilizations here at the museum.}
<A>__{adam gives a reluctant wave.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{hey kids.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to adam)}
<D>__{why don't you tell us what we're looking at.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(begrudgingly)}
<D>__{this here is a family of homo sapiens who lived in europe about 25,000 year's ago...}
<A>__{in excitement, the kids move in for a closer look. unaffected, the teacher stays back and files her nails.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{...these cro magnon's as they're often called, are the closest in the evolutionary chain to modern day humans...}
<A>__{kid 1 touches the cro magnon father. still talking, adam steps in and moves kid 1's hand off.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{...what made cro magnon so advanced was their sense of community...they were the first to settle on a single plot of land, devote to one partner, raise a family, and take care of the sick.}
<C>__{kid 1}
<P>__{(to seth)}
<D>__{this is lame! i thought you said we were gonna see dinosaurs.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(to adam)}
<D>__{see, i told you.}
<A>__{damage control. seth points to a life sized neanderthal man holding a spear.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(in excitement)}
<D>__{who wants to hear about the caveman?}
<A>__{seth picks up the spear and pretends to charge adam.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{caveman. rrrrrr!}
<A>__{the kids cheer. annoyed, adam takes the spear out of seth's hand.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{this is homo neanderthalensis the neanderthal man. for over 150,000 years his ancestors dominated all of europe. but then about 30,000 years ago, neanderthals began to disappear, until one day, their entire civilization was gone.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{greg you know what happened.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{i do?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{come on! tell us what happened to the caveman.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well no one knows for sure. but it's suspected that because neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman, he roamed the land, only fending for himself never learning to cohabitate with others. so as cro magnon families settled into europe, they took over the land. one by one, neanderthal was pushed out...and never seen, or heard from again.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(game show voice)}
<D>__{that's quite a story. thank you adam.}
<A>__{seth and adam look at the kids, they look bored.}
<C>__{seth }
<P>__{(quietly to adam)}
<D>__{you really know how to win a crowd.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(to the kids)}
<D>__{but you never know, just cause they vanished doesn't mean they're gone. for all we know, there could be a neanderthal walking among us right now. and by the looks of this guy here }
<P>__{(points at neanderthal)}
<D>__{i'd say he probably plays defense for the raiders.}
<A>__{adam's joke gets a small laugh from the teacher, but zero response from the kids.}
<C>__{kid 1}
<D>__{this sucks ass.}
<A>__{adam and seth look at each other in shock...seth chimes in }
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i see dinosaurs.}
<A>__{seth runs down the hall towards the dinosaur exhibit. the kids follow in excitement. the teacher barely bats an eye as she takes her time slowly trailing after the group.}
