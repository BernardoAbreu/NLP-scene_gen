<L>__{interior abandoned prison living room set montreal day}
<A>__{ramirez walks casually through the living room with camera following. amos and jack walk behind him. ramirez bends down to tie his shoe near the sofa. he crosses into the kitchen and camera follows. he opens the refrigerator and takes out a carton of milk. he takes a drink from the carton and dribbles some onto his shirt and onto the floor. he gets an "i'm such a slob" look on his face. then he replaces the milk, crosses to the sink, takes the sponge off the sink and a paper towel. he mops up the spill with the sponge first and then with the paper towel, then tosses the paper towel into the trash. as he speaks, ramirez himself will be amazed at how much he is able to deduce using the techniques he's been taught.}

<P>__{(looking at watch)}
<D>__{time's up.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{nu? is she telling the truth or lying?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{she's got to be lying, otherwise this would be a very short test and i don't think that's what you had in mind. she had a man over.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{she hasn't been here in a week? then why was the sponge still damp. it means she washed dishes. take a look at the dish rack. there's water in the tray underneath it. probably from a couple of plates. there's a bit of water in the silverware tray. the milk is still fresh... not even a hint of being sour and the date on it is a week from today... means she just bought it yesterday or the day before. the margarine's fresh bought but it's already been opened. same with the bread.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{how do you know it was a man?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(ignoring him a beat)}
<D>__{she might have met him at a bar because there's a book of matches in the garbage. she was probably careful to throw the cigarette away but there's still a bit of ash and that cigarette smell at the bottom of the liner.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what else?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i think they made love on the sofa because one of the cushions has been turned over and there's the indentation of a tennis shoe print in the rug over there.}
<A>__{he looks down at jack's shoes.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{sorta like the ones you're wearing, jack. besides, i know it was a man because i smelled after shave on the couch.}
<A>__{he gets a quizzical look, crosses to the couch, sniffs.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{...cheap kind.}
<A>__{he crosses to jack and sniffs jack as well.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{jack... you've been fucking my wife.}
<A>__{he holds index finger and thumb up to jack's head like a gun, reprising his mentor's gesture to him and making the sound of a gunshot with his mouth.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{now who's dead?}
