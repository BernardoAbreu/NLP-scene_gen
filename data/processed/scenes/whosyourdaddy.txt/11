<L>__{interior ted's office newsroom day}
<A>__{julie sits in a chair in front of ted's desk. she and ted size up one another.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{merk's punishment was cruel. expulsion without appeal. or working for me on the school paper. the school paper would be torture for a gonzo reporter like julie and we both knew it. but what choice did she have?}
<A>__{julie leans back on the chair, rests her feet on ted's files, and blows a huge bubble.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{so, william randolph. your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of rice crispie treats and chocolate snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's just one example. my reporting has made a difference.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{the school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. my award winning expose changed all that. the city added an extra weekday trash pick up.}
<A>__{julie deadpans...}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{is it true? is ignorance bliss?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, i loved "exposed!" and i hate it that you got busted. i know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not that bad.}
<A>__{ted's eyes wander to christy, who prances around the newsroom. julie notices.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{don't even tell me you're hot for miss titty pom poms over there.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{christy's a very talented journalist. i see a pulitzer in her future.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i didn't know they gave them for best lip gloss retention during a blow job.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{me ow.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{go ahead. ask her to the prom. get it over with.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i have absolutely no intention }
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{ do it. i triple dog dare you.}
<B>__{back to corridor}
<A>__{ted nears christy. students stare as he passes. they elbow one another. whispering.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{so you see, this is really about a triple dog dare. i don't even know what it means. i just know, unless it's a felony, a triple dog dare pretty much has to be met with immediate action.}
<A>__{ted seems unaware that all eyes are upon him. the cacophony of the corridor settles. he gets down on one knee in front of christy. christy looks down on ted. smiles that smile. which freezes as her eyes dart. realizing that everyone is staring at them with great anticipation.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{uh, christy, i was wondering...}
<C>__{all students}
<D>__{would you go to the prom with me?!!!}
<A>__{the corridor explodes with laughter. ted flushes with embarrassment. christy looks mortified.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(through gritted teeth)}
<D>__{ted, have you lost your mind?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you like me. i like you. i guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{i don't like you. we're just friends.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{but that smile.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{oh, ted, duh. i smile at everyone since i got my braces off.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{so you'll think about it?}
<A>__{christy laughs derisively.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{you really don't get it, do you? i am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! it's, like, a caveman thing!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{so that's a maybe?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{the answer is never, ted, never. except maybe in your dreams.}
<A>__{christy flees. leaving ted kneeling there. alone. unless you count the hoards of students who are watching and laughing}
<B>__{hysterically.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{in my dreams. of course.}
<P>__{(repeating; chanting)}
<D>__{this is a dream. this is only a dream.}
<A>__{julie approaches. gives him a hand. helps him up.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{no, ted. this is an actual emergency.}
