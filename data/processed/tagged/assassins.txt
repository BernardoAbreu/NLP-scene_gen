<T>__{fade in:}
<B>__{perfect square of black}
<A>__{we know that we are looking at something because its polished surface shimmers with light. pulling back, other squares are revealed; the black and white tiles of a chess board. the board rises and spins, slipping beneath us we find ourselves moving across the board, moving through a chess game. the pieces are everywhere, checking and covering other pieces. it has reached that critical moment when pieces are traded and the board begins to clear as two strategies unravel towards a final outcome. standing above the pieces around him, we see the black king. we move closer towards his face, closer to his chiseled ebony features, closer until we are staring into his cold black eyes...}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior marsh sunglasses dusk}
<A>__{the red setting sun is reflected in the black lens. two men are tromping through the calf deep mud of an end less marsh. it is fall, the first frost not far away and the foliage is brown and bare. with the red orange ball of fire melting into the horizon, the two men at first appear as only silhouettes or shadows slogging through the mire. the man with the sunglasses walks behind the other man. he is very well dressed in a dark suit. a .22 caliber gun, fitted with a long silencer, dangles from his hand. his name is robert rath. the other man is willie ketcham. he is also wearing a very expensive suit though it is being destroyed by the brambles and mud. as he lifts his foot his gucci shoe is sucked off by the mud.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{aw shit!}
<A>__{he balances on one leg, holding his silk socked foot in the air. he looks at the shoe, already filling with mud. he looks at rath.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{how much farther?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{just a little ways. up to those trees.}
<A>__{about a half mile further into the thickening marsh there is a small cluster of trees.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{oh, fuck it.}
<A>__{he pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud. he smiles. it feels good. he hurls the sock. lifting his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that. he grabs for the other sock, struggling to get it off, laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud. rath waits, a faint smile. he manages to get the sock off and then stands digging both feet into the dark, wet earth.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{hey, this feels kinda good.}
<A>__{they move on, ketcham almost playing, sinking his feet deep pulling them out to make a splurching, sucking noise.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{hey, do you mind if i talk a little? i feel like, i don't know, talking i guess.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{funny, i've never been a talker. my wife was always getting on me about that. 'say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.' i never would though. not really.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{i don't know. part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'what's she going to be able to do?' i don't know. maybe i didn't trust her.}
<A>__{he picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a snowball.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{my margaret... i loved her but you know what? i cheated on her. all the time. i don't even know why. it wasn't the sex, margaret was great in bed. i think if i wasn't married i wouldn't have even looked at some of those women. i knew she couldn't trust me, so how could i trust her? if she was here right now i'd think that i would tell her that i was sorry... 'course, if she were here right now, maybe i wouldn't feel like talking.}
<A>__{he throws the mud ball at the grove of trees but they are too far.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{i think i've heard of you.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{it's possible.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{you're pretty famous aren't you?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i hope not.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{i know this may seem like a strange question, but can i ask you how much the contract was for not to insult you or anything, i know you're a professional, but just for me, i was just wondering.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{it's a common question.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{oh yeah? i guess we still need to see that price tag. like art, right? you hang some painting that looks like baby puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{a dime.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{one hundred thousand? that's it? jesus... is that a lot?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{average.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{shit... oh well.}
<A>__{ketcham laughs.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{i have been thinking about this for a long while. i knew this day was coming. i knew someday someone would make the call on me. i never thought about anyone that i had whacked. what do you call it anyway?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{taken.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{'taken.' that's nice. when i had someone taken i would call our general contractor, transfer the money and as soon as i hung up the phone i forgot about them.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{everyone who plays the game knows the rules.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{that's exactly what i told myself.}
<A>__{ketcham laughs again. he is getting kind of giggly, like he's high.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{i always wondered what i'd be thinking at this exact moment. i imagined that i would be thinking about the fucker who contracted this, trying to figure out who it was...}
<A>__{something occurs to him and he looks back at rath.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{don't know. that's how it works.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{that's what our general contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{i thought that i would be thinking about margaret, or work, or that i'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but i'm not. i'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but i can't. it seems very funny to me.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{what are you thinking about?}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{i'm thinking about moonpies. ain't that funny? i haven't had a moonpie since i was ten years old. right now, i'm thinking how much i'd love one.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{and an r.c.}
<A>__{he's 'laughing' and rath laughs with him. ketcham suddenly stops laughing. they are nearly to the cluster of trees.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{can i ask you something?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{what do other guys do?}
<A>__{he looks at the trees, his voice dying in the wind.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{everyone handles it differently. some are ready, some are not.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{some.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{when i thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying. it wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. it was something that i could never get away from... but now, i feel it's okay. i feel good.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{can i ask you a question?}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{anything.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{why didn't you fade?}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{you mean quit?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{i used to think about it. i had margaret. she wanted kids. i thought about moving somewhere far away like, europe. i could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but i couldn't see that next part. 'then what?' so i'd stop thinking about it and go back to work. you understand?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{ketcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch trees.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{i always pictured that i would end in some land fill, under someone else's garbage. i kept picturing those plastic diapers filled with some baby's green shit, covering me. but this is nice...}
<A>__{he looks at the sun, bloody red seeping into the black horizon.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{look at that. i haven't watched the sun set in a million years. do you mind?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{ketcham stares at the last of the light.}
<C>__{ketcham}
<D>__{nice... real nice.}
<A>__{with his face hidden from rath he begins to cry. rath watches ketcham staring at the setting sun. rath looks down at the gun limply held in his hand. when the sun is gone, a red glow at the bottom of a dark ening sky, we hear the gun, silenced, once, then the body falling into the mud. after a beat we hear two more}
<B>__{shots.}
<A>__{ketcham is lying face down, already sinking into the mud, a red cloud mushrooming around his head like the red haze left by the dying sun. rath breathes in deep and lets the air out slowly, stand ing alone in the middle of nowhere.}
<L>__{interior hotel suite night}
<A>__{the room is dark and still. a man is standing at a wall of windows that glow from the amber wash of urban light. snow is falling, heavy white flakes glittering in the city's electric night. the man finishes his bourbon, ice clinking in the empty glass. he is slightly drunk and he sways forward until his forehead rests against the window. in the dim light, we recognize the man as rath. outside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for christmas. he watches the snowflakes drift to the distant street below. he is wondering what it would feel like to let himself fall, when there is a knock at the door. crossing the room, he opens the door. backlit by the bright hallway light is a woman. she has already removed her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see that her dress is very short and very tight.}
<C>__{escort }
<D>__{hi. did you call }
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes. please come in.}
<A>__{her high heels tap against the tile foyer as she enters and he takes her coat.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{goodness, it's so dark...}
<A>__{she reaches for the wall switch but he stops her.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i prefer it like this.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{how can a beautiful man like you be shy?}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i prefer it, that's all.}
<A>__{she moves closer to him, the sexual confidence of her body radiating like heat.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{it's okay, honey. we can do it anyway you want.}
<A>__{rath is obviously uncomfortable.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{would you like a drink?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{i'd love one. whatever you're having.}
<A>__{they move into the room, from a distance, as featureless as two shadows. she stands at the windows watching the snow bubble of a city night.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{beautiful.}
<A>__{he hands her the drink. her smile is bright and perfect.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{good will towards men.}
<A>__{their glasses clink as he drains half his drink. if she drinks at all, we can not tell.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{why are you working today?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{holidays are our busiest days. no one likes to be alone on holidays. i know i don't.}
<A>__{she touches his face, the caress and her expression of tenderness seemingly genuine.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you're very good at this aren't you?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{i think you're supposed to answer that question.}
<A>__{her hand slides down his chest, but before it goes any farther rath turns away, returning to the bar.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i know what you expect, but i don't want...}
<A>__{he pours himself another drink.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{that's okay, hon, i always expect the unexpected.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i called because i just want... i need to talk.}
<A>__{she sits on the couch, her body language changing, as she becomes a listener.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i've been thinking about my life, about things i have done... what i do for a living is in some ways similiar to what you do.}
<A>__{he sits on the other end of the couch, his words thickened by the alcohol.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i know that everything has a price. i want you to understand that i'm willing to pay.}
<A>__{he takes out an envelope and puts it between them. she picks it up, glancing inside at a stack of hundred dollar bills.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{honesty.}
<A>__{she puts the envelope down.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i just want to ask you some questions.}
<A>__{uncomfortable, she waits as he searches his drink for the right words.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{do you ever regret things you've done?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{everyone regrets something.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{but when you finlsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{sometimes.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{do you think about their wives or their families?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{no. they call me, i don't call them. if they didn't call i wouldn't exist.}
<A>__{rath nods. his next question is barely audible.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{do you ever think about starting over?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{all the time.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{can you tell me about it?}
<A>__{for the first time we really see her take a drink. she closes her eyes.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{sometimes i dream that i meet a man, this good, honest man and we fall in love. i imagine us living on a boat, reading books, sailing to places where no one knows who we were or cares what we did.}
<A>__{she opens her eyes and looks at him.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{and what if you never meet that man?}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{then, i will sail alone.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{do you believe that?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{are you asking me if i believe in another life?}
<A>__{rath nods.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{i have to.}
<A>__{she finishes her drink.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{is that all you want?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{she picks up the money and stands.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{anytime.}
<L>__{interior hotel suite night}
<A>__{it is the same room but now it is very cluttered, room service trays and empty liquor bottles tossed about. he has been here for a while. he is sitting at the table, staring intensely at a chess game; we see the board and all of the pieces set in the same positions as in the opening sequence. he rubs at the whiskers that have darkened his face and then finishes off another bottle of bourbon. he flings the empty bottle across the room as he reaches over the board and moves one of white knights, taking a black rook. a sequence begins, obvious, and he works through it moving both the black and white pieces. suddenly he stops. he gets up and shifts to the other side of the board, studying the game from white's perspective. another sequence emerges and he trades the pieces through it as he moves around the table, returning to his place behind the black king. the games reaches its end as black is check mated. he slumps down onto the table and looks across at the white king.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{fuck you, nick.}
<L>__{interior hotel suite dawn}
<A>__{rath is at a desk where he has set up his computer office; a cellular phone is plugged into a modem with cables winding through a scrambler and then into a fax machine and the latest high powered lap top computer. on the table near the desk, we see the .22, dismantled and cleaned, spread out on a white towel. he types in a complicated access code sequence, then waits, staring at the blank screen.}
<D>__{contractor screen where have you been, robert? rath screen sick. the flu. contractor screen i don't believe you.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i don't give a fuck rath screen it's true. contractor screen i have been sitting on a contract from cleveland for six days because of you.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{fuck you, fuck cleveland, and fuck your contracts rath screen i need a rest. contractor screen that's impossible, robert. you're at the top of your field. these are the best contracts. to stop now would be self destructive.}
<A>__{he looks away from the screen and sees the chess game on the table.}
<D>__{rath screen send the file. i will have the estimate tonight. contractor screen i'm worried about you, robert.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you fucking should be rath screen don't be.}
<A>__{on the screen the word "transmitting" appears. rath slowly gets out of his chair. the fax machine clicks and huxs to life as a photograph of a smiling, old italian man curls onto the desk. rath begins destroying the hotel room, smashing anything he can get his hands on.}
<L>__{interior hotel suite day}
<A>__{rath is in the middle of the room which he has demolished. having showered and shaved, he is now standing naked, in the midst of the rubble, practicing the slow and graceful art of tai chi.}
<L>__{interior hotel suite night}
<A>__{rath is working at the desk. he is tallying numbers, materials, totaling his estimate. spread out over the table are several faxed photos of the old italian, leevio valli, usually surrounded by bodyguards. the file details valli's life and his daily routine. it includes: phone bills, credit card and bank account statements, driver license and vehicle registration, the real estate listing of his house and even a copy of his income tax return. satisfied with his figures, rath plugs the phone into the modem and makes a call. the network comes on line as the general contractor types:}
<D>__{contractor screen you're too late, robert.}
<A>__{rath types.}
<D>__{rath screen what? contractor screen the contract was stolen.}
<A>__{rath stares at the screen.}
<D>__{rath screen who? contractor screen a new player. he's using the name nicholai.}
<A>__{the name hits rath and he sits, unable to breathe.}
<D>__{contractor screen you know what must be done.}
<A>__{the screen goes black as the network shuts down. rath looks down at the pile of assembled facts. he lifts a credit card bill on which the name of a restaurant appears every friday. the name of the restaurant has been circled in red pen by rath: "trattoria roma."}
<L>__{exterior trattoria roma night}
<A>__{a red awning spans the entrance of a popular italian restaurant.}
<L>__{interior trattoria roma}
<A>__{it is a large establishment with many tables and booths. the dinner crowd is a mix of yuppies and older italian families who have been eating here for years. rath is sitting alone at a booth. with very subtle changes to his appearance, he looks like an older italian. in front of him is a glass and a carafe of dark red wine. he touches neither of them. his eyes shift as he studies the room. leevio valli pushes into the restaurant surrounded by five gorillas in italian suits. the owner hurries to greet them, hugging, kissing, speaking only italian. the entourage moves through the restaurant to the over sized booth in the back. rath does not look twice at them. immediately he is watching everyone else, looking for the other assassin. leevio slides into the booth as his goons stand and sit around the table, obscuring him from all parts of the room. a wine steward immediately brings a bottle of red wine and fills their glasses. a pretty waitress sets a steaming loaf of garlic bread out and a giant bowl of minestrone in front of leevio. he tells her something and she giggles. they joke in italian, watching her ass as she wiggles back to the kitchen. at leevio's table the wine steward returns to fill their glasses. it is the goon standing against the wall that is the first to realize that it is not the same wine steward. he is the second assassin, much younger than rath. his name is bain. he smiles. the goon reaches for his gun as bain shatters the bottle of wine into his face. he screams. leevio coughs a spray of minestrone, as a gun flashes free from the white linen towel hung over the steward's arm. it happens instantly. four shots and the goons are dead. leevio screams.}
<C>__{leevio}
<D>__{don't!}
<A>__{a fifth, sixth and seventh shot. leevio's body falls forward and softly thuds on the table. bain whips around drawing a small semi automatic weapon from his belt expecting an attack. facing the screaming crowd, he begins to shoot anyone who moves or stands, men or women. there is chaos in the restaurant. people scream, falling to the ground, scrambling under tables. bain is sweating, his eyes shifting wildly from one end of the room to the other. the restaurant falls quiet except for several people who are sobbing. he moves through the room, watching, searching.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{don't anybody move. you move, you're dead.}
<A>__{he passes the table rath was sitting at, but it is empty.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{come on, you chicken shit motherfucker. i know you're here. let's go.}
<L>__{exterior concrete parking garage}
<A>__{across the street from trattoria roma, rath jacks together a german assault rifle with night scope.}
<L>__{interior trattoria roma}
<A>__{bain looks out the window at the dark street. he turns and searches through the people huddled on the floor. he aims his gun.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{you! get up!}
<A>__{a quivering wine steward stands. he points to another.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{you, too! up!}
<L>__{exterior parking garage}
<A>__{through the night scope we see the front door to the restaurant open and a group of wine stewards clumped together slowly back out.}
<L>__{interior trattoria roma}
<A>__{bain is second from the end, both guns aimed at the stewards. one of them begins to cry.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{not yet. don't move or you're fucking dead.}
<L>__{interior parking garage}
<A>__{rath moves the scope back and forth, unable to pick out the assassin.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{shit. just do them all. all of them. shit.}
<A>__{he can't pull the trigger.}
<L>__{exterior trattoria storefront}
<A>__{the group moves toward the street.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{now run!}
<A>__{like dogs out of the gate, they bolt.}
<L>__{interior parking garage}
<A>__{rath watches as they scatter, finding bain in his scope.}
<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{a chunk of brick explodes from the wall just behind bain's head as he drops behind the row of parked cars along the curb. he laughs. we get the idea that bain is enjoying this.}
<L>__{interior parking garage}
<A>__{rath looks over his scope, talking to himself. he is sweating.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{shit. what are you doing, old man? you're too fucking slow.}
<A>__{he looks back into the scope and begins scanning the line of cars.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{okay. which one? which one is yours?}
<L>__{exterior city street}
<A>__{bain is crawling alongside the tightly parked cars, staying low and out of sight. he works his way up to a black mercedes that is parked illegally next to a fire hydrant and takes out his keys. he hits the remote unlocking the doors.}
<L>__{interior parking garage}
<A>__{rath finds the fire hydrant in his scope, almost obscured by the parked mercedes.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{amateur.}
<A>__{he takes aim.}
<L>__{exterior city street}
<A>__{just as bain starts to open the door, the front tire explodes. another second, the back tire explodes.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{fuck!}
<L>__{interior parking garage}
<A>__{rath waits, steely calm, his finger on the trigger.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{your move.}
<L>__{exterior city street}
<A>__{bain hears the growing wail of police sirens. thinking for a moment, he opens the car door and pulls a long handled switchblade and a roll of electrician's tape from the glove compartment.}
<L>__{interior parking garage}
<A>__{rath sees the car light go on, but can't make out what bain is doing. the sirens are getting louder. there's a lot of them.}
<L>__{exterior city street}
<A>__{bain finishes taping the knife to his forearm and rolls his shirt sleeve down. from his pocket he takes out a gameboy and begins playing "tetris."}
<L>__{interior parking garage}
<A>__{rath watches as the police cars come racing down the street.}
<L>__{exterior city street}
<A>__{the cars screech to a halt in front of the restaurant. the cops jump out, drawing their weapons. bain throws his guns down, raising his hands in the air.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{don't shoot! don't shoot! i give up!}
<A>__{more cars come screeching up as the two officers hold their beads on bain.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{hit the ground! face down! spread your legs!}
<A>__{bain follows the orders as the second cop edges up to him, frisking him. in this position the cop is unable to find the knife strapped to bain's forearm, but finds the gameboy.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{hey, don't touch that!}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{the cop twists bain's arms behind his back, handcuffing him tightly. they drag him to his feet, a swarm of police and paramedics in the street.}
<L>__{interior parking garage}
<A>__{rath holds them in his cross hairs as they move to the police car, but is unable to get a clean shot. bain is using the cops for cover, keeping his head low.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{son of a bitch.}
<A>__{the cops shove bain into the back seat. rath very quickly walks to his car, tossing his gun into the trunk. he gets in and starts the engine.}
<L>__{interior patrol car}
<A>__{the two officers are outside the car talking with the sergeant. bain, laying low beneath the windows, peeks up at the shadowy parking garage. he smiles. the two policemen get in the car, the second picking up the radio. the driver guns the engine and the black and white rumbles down the street.}
<D>__{cop #2 this is 181, returning with suspect involved in multiple shooting at trattoria roma. repeat, en route with suspect.}
<A>__{he hangs up the radio and looks back at bain through the metal caging.}
<D>__{cop #2 jesus christ, do you know who you shot in there?}
<A>__{bain almost laughs.}
<D>__{cop #2 what are you? some kind of a hitman?}
<A>__{bain looks out the window.}
<D>__{cop #2 you know what we call guys like you?}
<A>__{bain looks at him.}
<D>__{cop #2 sizzle lean. they're gonna fry your ass.}
<A>__{he laughs at his own joke, looking at his partner, who chuckles.}
<L>__{exterior city street}

<A>__{the cabby jumps out, rattling off a string of obscenities. rath gets out of the white car, starting to apologize, as the cabby moves toward him. when he's close enough, rath decks him, knocking him unconscious. he picks him up and puts him in the white car. rath then gets in the cab and when the light changes to green, he drives off.}

<A>__{rath circles the area, turning up the cab's cb. a couple of calls crackle through the speaker, before he hears what he's waiting for; an airport fare in this area. at the intersection of adams and nine. he picks up the mike.}

<D>__{didn't you here all them sirens? it's been all over the radio. some guy shot leevio valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the trattoria roma.}

<D>__{no shit.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yeah, it's terrible. i mean valli, and i don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook. he probably had it coming, but all the other people. real sad.}

<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{but they caught the guy. i heard it all. sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco. shooting anybody. drugs, probably.}

<D>__{holy fucking shit!}
<A>__{the cab rocks as both men move. instantly guns fill their hands. bain ripping out a .357 lifted from one of the dead cops. rath rolls to the side whipping the gun free from his jacket. bain throws open the door, about to run, but stops. he looks at rath. he wants him to run. anyone who moves away from the bullet proof glass is dead. both men are silent, each holding the other in their gun sights. bain blinks, sweat forming on his lip.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{i get out, you got me.}

<C>__{bain}
<D>__{jesus i'm being driven to the airport by robert rath.}
<A>__{he laughs.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{i can't believe this. you rolled some cabby for the radio, then waited for an airport fare.}

<C>__{bain}
<D>__{hey. what i don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant? i mean you had me, a free shot. that's what i would have done.}
<C>__{rath}

<A>__{rath studies him.}

<D>__{you're wearing a wig now.}
<A>__{bain chokes on his laugh.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{god damn are you good. everyone says you're so fucking good. i just can't believe i'm still alive. if i believed in god, i'd be down on my knees. right now hey, how come you just didn't plug us all when we came through the door?}
<A>__{rath does not answer. bain smiles. he knows something about rath now; he doesn't like killing innocent people.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{shit if i was you, back there }
<A>__{he holds his gun up to the bulletproof glass behind rath's head.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{game over.}
<A>__{he laughs.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{do you mind if i ask you a couple of business questions? you know i was wondering how much you bid this job at?}
<A>__{rath says nothing.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{you don't have to tell me that. it's just, i know my bid was low, but was it too low? i mean, did i seem like an amateur, like i didn't know what i was doing?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{we both know what you were doing.}
<A>__{bain moves close to the glass again, checking out rath's gun.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{smith and wesson .22 with an eight inch silencer. classic. when i first heard you used that, i thought, shit, that's a lady's gun. now, it's all i use. clean, real clean.}

<C>__{bain}
<D>__{would you really blow us?}
<A>__{rath does not have to answer.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{oh! i got a question. jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years shit, listen to me. i sound like some fucking fanboy. i'm sorry, but i just got to ask you. everybody talks about how you left the agency and got into the business and then how you went after the russian, nicholai talinkov }
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{tachlinkov.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{yeah, that's it. and he's like a fucking genius. they said he shaded you over and over. and in the end, he aced you again. shaded and faded. they say he's living on some greek island, but i say that's fucking bullshit. i say you're the best and that you planted his ass. am i right?}
<A>__{rath says nothing.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{i bet i'm right.}
<A>__{the car passes under a sign indicating the ramp for the cleveland airport.}

<C>__{rath}
<D>__{after those cops, you'll never be able to come back to cleveland.}

<A>__{a long beat of silence. the cab rumbles up onto the "departures" ramp which circles past all of the terminals.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{so what happens now?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{we go around once.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<A>__{he throws off his seatbelt.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{you tell me that we're gonna go around once, then, while i'm checking out the lay of the land, you bail out and send me flying over the bridge. right? am i right?}
<A>__{rath doesn't answer, studying the terminals, noting the police and airport security. rath studies the terrain. bain studies rath. soon they have passed the entire airport. rath nods. steering the car through traffic in onto a circle interchange that will bring them to the beginning. bain wipes the sweat from his face.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{what? what's okay?}
<A>__{rath begins to accelerate, rounding the interchange.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{there's a sand barricade up ahead; i'm going to ram this cab into it. the cab has an airbag, odds are good i will survive. but with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.}
<A>__{bain laughs.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{oh man, that's sweet. that's fucking sweet.}
<A>__{the speedometer continues to climb.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{you're bluffing.}
<A>__{rath says nothing. ahead, at the ramp to the terminals, is the sand barricade.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{you're fucking with me. you want me to jump. i jump, you hit the brakes and bang game over.}
<A>__{the cab is flying at its target.}

<D>__{no, no. wait. you don't want me to jump. you're going to jump. i'm stuck back here until it's too late. wham over!}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i know you're going to jump.}
<A>__{bain looks at him and then at the barricade.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you're still young. young enough to still think you're indestructible. invincible. you believe with utter certainty you can bail out at the last second and survive.}
<A>__{the barricade hurtles toward them, rising up, filling the windshield.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{if you do survive, we'll see each other again.}
<A>__{bain screams, throwing open the door and hurling himself out. rath jams on the brakes, tires screaming, steering into the steel side rail, banking the car into the drums of sand as bain hits the pavement, bouncing like a stone skipped across water. a driver hits his brakes, swerving, just missing him. sand explodes from the impact and the cab bounces up over the median into the bus only lanes as the driver's airbag balloons out of the steering wheel. bain rolls and rolls, finally stopping sprawled out like a piece of roadkill. the cab careens up onto a curb, slamming into a pole, the radiator spitting out a cloud of whistling steam. several cars lock up and collide to avoid bain; one car stopping inches from him. a woman jumps out, rushing to the front of the car, but bain is gone. police cars roar up into the midst of the accident. one of them pulling alongside the demolished cab. the door is open, the airbag popped. rath is gone.}

<A>__{the apartment is always dark; heavy drapes cover the windows. the dining and living rooms look like the control booth of a network television show, stacks of video monitors and consoles, cables, electric wiring, coils of fiber optic cord duct taped to the floors, walls and ceilings. they snake through holes punched in the plaster walls and hang everywhere like some technological jungle. at the center of this tangled web is electra, a beautiful athletic looking woman wearing only her underwear and a worn robe. she is curled up in an overstuffed chair, a bowl of popcorn in her lap. on the monitors, she is watching what at first might be mistaken for a soap opera; a young couple are having an argument. what is strange is that the angle never changes; a fish eye lens staring down into the room.}

<A>__{nikita, electra's black cat, is stretched lazily across the top of a chair, her tail twitching absently. every corner of the chair has been clawed open. electra reaches for the control board and throws a series of switches. the monitors flicker as the image changes. we are now looking down into a kitchen. a stove is beneath us, almost like a cooking show, where a round woman is taking out a tray of chocolate chip cookies. electra smells them again, smiling as she inhales.}

<A>__{she punches a button and shoves the antennae down. the hotel room looks like her apartment. there is a computer and a series of monitors stacked on top of the wood laminate desk. cables whip and wind across the carpeted floor to the central air duct. the panel has been removed and intertwined black and gray coaxial run up inside the duct. immediately, electra is busy finishing her preparations. she snaps in several power cords and the system comes on line. on the monitor screen, we see an empty hotel room that looks exactly like the one she is in.}
<L>__{interior cab}
<A>__{rath stares out the window, watching the surrounding traffic, the limo still in sight. something occurs to him and he looks down at the folded newspaper where he had hid the contract file. he flips past several documents before finding what he's looking for; the cat. he pulls the dark fax of nikita and stares at it.}
<L>__{interior hotel room}
<A>__{laying on the bed, in a patch of sunlight, nikita watches electra rush about. electra grabs the sheet from under the comforter and yanks it out.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{excuse me, your highness.}
<A>__{nikita casually walks off the bed. electra takes the sheet to the open duct and tears off a long piece of duct tape.}

<C>__{electra}
<D>__{room 1414.}
<L>__{interior hyatt lobby}
<A>__{with several other guests, the japanese men crowd into an elevator. the doors close. across the lobby, rath enters, walking past the elevators.}
<L>__{interior elevator}
<A>__{as the elevator rises, we begin to hear a sound, a familiar sound. cramped in the corner is bain. he is playing "tetris," wearing dark sunglasses and a walkman pumping speed metal into his ears.}
<L>__{interior hotel room}
<A>__{electra continues to pace, checking the monitors.}
<L>__{interior room service kitchen}
<A>__{at the switchboard, a young hotel employee wearing an operator's headset, takes a late breakfast order, typing the order in the hotel computer.}

<A>__{he turns around and rath is right behind him.}

<L>__{interior hall}
<A>__{bain follows them down the hall, still playing the game. there is again an ominous sense of predator moving in on its prey. as akira finds 1414 and opens the door, another door burst open, a large family, heading for the pool. the moment is gone; the japanese men close the door and bain continues down the hall again, playing the game.}
<L>__{interior hotel suite}
<A>__{when the japanese men enter the suite, we realize that this is the image on electra's monitors. surveillance camcorders and microphones are mounted in various locations to display every inch of the room. the group hesitates for a moment, under the electronic eyes. the four goons have their hands in their jackets. a small laptop computer sits on the coffee table humming softly. it is the only noise in the room until a speaker crackles.}
<P>__{electra speaker (v.o.)}
<D>__{good morning, gentlemen. i apologize for the arrangement, but we all know those aren't business cards you're reaching for. if anyone leaves this room, the deal's off.}
<L>__{interior room service kitchen}

<A>__{on the monitor, we see akira at the coffee table shove the first disk into the laptop disk drive.}
<L>__{interior hotel suite}
<A>__{akira turns from the small computer screen and nods at a goon, who drops a green brick of bound one hundred dollar bills, down the central air duct. the little clock on the laptop ticks away as it copies.}

<C>__{bain}
<D>__{yes!}

<C>__{bain}
<D>__{surprise!}
<A>__{he raises his arm, his gun spitting silent bullets.}
<L>__{interior hotel room}
<A>__{electra stares in horror at the monitors as bain grabs the nearest bodyguard, firing a shot into his belly.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{oh, god.}
<L>__{interior hotel suite}
<A>__{another shot and the second bodyguard falls. the other two draw their handguns and bain shields himself with the lifeless body of his first victim. they fire at bain but are unable to hit him. bain squeezes off two more shots and the two men fall dead. he lets his human shield fall to the ground and levels his gun on the shaking akira.}
<C>__{akira}
<D>__{don't kill me.}
<A>__{bain looks at him and smiles, then fires.}
<L>__{interior hotel room}
<A>__{electra leaps at the computer, ripping the cord from the modem. bain sees the fiber optic cable and looks right into it.}
<C>__{bain }
<D>__{tricky. boy, you just can't trust anyone these days.}
<A>__{he licks the lens, leaving a smear of saliva. she stuffs the disks into her bag. she puts nikita in her "travel kitty" and charges for the door, grabbing her coat. flinging it over her shoulder, she does not notice the letter from ken slip out of her pocket as she bolts from the room.}
<L>__{interior hall}

<A>__{electra's black car roars out of the garage, onto the open street.}
<L>__{interior hyatt hotel day}
<A>__{the door swings open. from the hall we can hear the familiar beeping of the computer game. the room, 1014, is the same as electra had left it when she ran out. jutting from a shadow on the floor is the corner of ken's letter.}

<A>__{electra drives, obviously nervous, as rath watches out the rear window.}

<D>__{hi. this is room 1414 }
<A>__{behind him, in the bathroom mirror, we see one of the japanese men hanging from the shower by his feet. he is naked.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{yes, could you send up a pot of coffee and my friends are going to need some more towels. thanks.}
<A>__{he hangs up the phone and walks over to one of the large blood stains on the carpet. he points the rug cleaner at the stain covering it with white foam.}

<C>__{electra}
<D>__{she won't stop unless you let her out.}

<C>__{electra}
<D>__{what? how did you know i had a cat?}

<C>__{rath}
<D>__{the bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.}
<A>__{electra seems ready to jump out of her skin. the speedometer is floating around 90.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{slow down.}
<A>__{he pulls out the disks.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.}

<L>__{interior hotel suite night}
<A>__{the room is immaculate; near the door, several over sized suitcases line the wall. bain is sitting at the desk. his walkman is on, music blasting, as he flips casually through the telephone directory. his finger eases down a column stopping at "morgan jennifer." there is a knock at the door. he smiles and tears out the page. there is another, louder knock which bain hears this time. he turn off the walkman and opens the door; a bellboy is waiting with a luggage cart.}
<C>__{bellboy}
<D>__{hello, sir. have you some luggage you need carried.}

<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you want me to pump?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no, stay in the car. i want you to understand something. if i intended to kill you, you would already be dead.}
<A>__{electra says nothing. he reaches over and takes the car keys. when he is out of the car, electra slowly releases the strangle hold she had on the steering wheel.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{okay, nikita, stay calm, think, breathe, think...}
<A>__{electra checks the rear view mirror, listening as rath pumps the gas. her eyes flash down to her bag. outside, rath watches electra through the windows. she appears motionless. the electric gas counter races like a stop watch. in the car, electra eases her hand into her bag. the tank full, rath re hangs the pump. he walks around the car and heads for the station. electra waits until his back is turned. she pulls her tool pouch from her bag, throws it open and finds her wire stripper. reaching under the dash, she yanks out a tangled handful of wire. she looks up; rath is inside paying.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{come on, come on, it's a cake walk.}
<A>__{her fingers fly with surgical precision, snipping, stripping, twisting. rath steps out of the station as her head pops up, looking for him. it takes only a second for him to realize what she is doing.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<A>__{he runs at the car as she strips the last set of wires and strikes them; the battery grinds.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{please, please.}
<A>__{he is almost there when the engine fires. she stomps on the gas, ramming the shift into drive. tires squealing, the car swerves forward as rath slams into it. he bounces backward, falling to the ground. the car fishtails away, accelerating as rath rolls to one knee, his gun automatically in his hand. he draws a bead, but, he does not shoot. with a concerted effort, he puts the gun away.}

<C>__{electra}
<D>__{letter?}

<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean to i'm sorry.}
<A>__{she shrugs and unlocks the interior door, leaving electra in the lobby. electra watches her, as her hand moves from pocket to pocket. a worried expression tightens her face; the letter is gone. she opens the interior door, following jennifer up the stairs.}
<L>__{interior staircase}
<A>__{electra climbs the stairs, her mind pouring through the possibilities, filled with fear. by the time electra reaches the top floor, jennifer is entering her apartment. electra hurries past jennifer's door to her own.}
<L>__{interior electra's apartment night}
<A>__{electra flies across the living room to the monitors. she clicks them on, putting on jennifer's channel. on the screen we see jennifer in her living room checking her phone messages. one from her mother. electra throws a few switches so that jennifer's entire apartment is in front of her. on one of the monitors we see a shadow slide across the oak floor as something moves along the edge of the room. jennifer has moved to the bathroom and is drawing a bath. electra clamps her hand over her mouth when he steps out. bain moves into the dining room where jennifer had just been. wearing rubber surgeon's gloves, he picks up the mail that she had dropped on the table and sorts through it. bain moves about the apartment with complete indifference to jennifer's presence; as if he were invisible, as though he knew she couldn't see him. he moves into a room, just as she moves out. electra watches, dizzy, sick with terror, but she is unable to turn away. bain searches through a desk drawer, while jennifer starts undressing for her bath. he walks down the hall and stands outside of the bathroom. if jennifer would turn around she would see him. electra is about to run, to call out when something catches bain's eye. he moves into the bedroom, and is turned so that he is looking straight up into the camera. he inches towards it, not sure what it is. the fiber optic cable is hidden in the light fixture hanging over the bed. staring at it, he is looking right at electra. bain steps up onto the bed, his face distorting as he moves close to the fish eye lens. poking it with his finger, he realizes what it is. a warped smile stretches across his face as he whispers }
<C>__{bain }
<D>__{oh, you sick little bitch }
<A>__{electra tears away from the screen, panic seizing hold of her. she rips entire drawers out of her dresser, dumping them into a suitcase, stuffing in anything that looks important. she grabs nikita in the "travel kitty."}

<L>__{interior electra's apartment}
<A>__{she scrambles from the kitchen, throwing her suitcase, still clutching the "travel kitty," as the back door explodes from its hinges, bain charging, firing his gun. bullets hissing past her, electra crashes through the front door into the hall.}
<L>__{interior hall}
<A>__{the stairs are at the far end. she is only halfway, when rath rises up the stairs, his gun cocked. electra drops to the floor as behind her, bain barrels from the apartment. rath fires. the wood door splinters, bullet holes surrounding bain. off balance, he lunges back into the apartment. rath continues firing, grabbing hold of electra. they run down the stairs.}

<L>__{exterior large chain hotel night}
<A>__{somewhere in the city.}
<L>__{interior hotel room}
<A>__{electra and rath enter the room together but they are both immediately alone. she walks across the room to a chair in the corner, curling into it even as nikita jumps up and curls into her lap. he sets his briefcase on the table at the opposite end of the room and sits. they watch each other. silence. between then is the liquor cabinet. rath knows a good idea when he sees one.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{want a drink?}
<A>__{her face is as expressionless as nikita's. he pours himself a very large bourbon and slugs it down. takes a deep breath, then pours himself another one.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{okay...}
<A>__{he returns to his table with his drink.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i'm not good at this sort of thing, but we don't have a lot of time, so i will just go ahead and get started. first: you. i ask myself, 'what is she thinking?'}
<A>__{her body tightens, coils.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{simple. she's scared. she's almost been killed twice and now she is alone in a room with a man that she believes is an... assassin.}
<A>__{another deep pull on the bourbon.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{furthermore she was brought here not entirely on her own accord which only increases her fear and suspicion. thus, as long as she is afraid, her first, maybe her only thought will be escape. does that leave me any other option?}
<A>__{he slugs down the rest of his drink and stands, whipping out his gun.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{crossing the room, he turns the gun around and offers it to her. she looks at it. back at him. he puts it on the bed beside her, turns his back and walks to the bar. she picks up the gun.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{the gun is silenced. she could shoot me right now.}
<A>__{she stands, nikita jumping from her lap.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{she could take the car and be far from here before the maid comes in the morning, but }
<A>__{she starts squeezing off rounds; the lamp explodes, the chairs around him erupt, tufts of white stuffing leaping into the air.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{he freezes, bottle in one hand, glass in the other.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{stop trying to tell me what i'm thinking!}
<A>__{she moves closer to him, the gun squeezed in her fist.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i will tell you what you're thinking you think i'm not going to shoot you but right now you're not so sure, are you?}
<A>__{a slight shake of the head, no.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you're thinking that maybe it was a mistake to give me this gun, that maybe i'm not going to think about things logically because i'm a woman and i'm freaked out and i'm going to do something impulsive and irrational right?}
<A>__{she fires the gun to both sides of his head. he's surprised to be alive.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you don't know shit about me! now sit down!}
<A>__{he returns to his chair and sits with the same expression she had worn sitting a moment ago. she opens the cabinet and grabs one of the sample bottles of liquor. she sucks it all down and throws the bottle across the room. grabbing another, she sits on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{okay. how did you find me?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you're the computer hacker, you tell me.}
<C>__{electra}

<D>__{if i still was what i used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.}
<A>__{electra eyes him, considers shooting him right now.}
<C>__{electra}

<C>__{rath}
<D>__{another contractor.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{someone hired both of you?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no. they hired bain. the contract would have been mine, but bain took it from me as he took the previous one.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{so this is something between you and him?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{he stole the contract knowing that i would come after him.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{because he is trying to retire me.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{he wants to kill you?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{the nature of the business. you remove your competition.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{and you want to use me to get him?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{forget it!}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{we don't have a choice.}

<D>__{don't tell me i don't have a choice!}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why i shouldn't shoot you.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{it's simple. you need me. i need you. and we will both need money.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i don't need you to get the money my money!}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{if it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.}
<A>__{she's up pacing, knowing there is some truth in that.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i don't need the money.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{this is something that is never going to end. you can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. to survive, you have to go into deep hiding. and that's going to take money, a lot of money.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{then you can have the disks and i will just walk out that door }
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{if you walk out that door, bain will still come after you.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{because he took a contract on you. he'll come for you and he'll find you.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you don't know that you're trying to scare me.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no. it's the truth. i know what you are. like me, like bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world. you don't have a social security number. you don't pay taxes. you've probably used ten different names over the last ten years. a long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy. you think you can do it again. but i'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing. no matter what you do, where you go, i swear to you that bain will find you.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment. he is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets. he will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books. if you keep a diary, he is reading it. he'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke. in the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled. if you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.}
<A>__{she is coming unglued. imagining him watching her tapes, going through her possessions. she is moving, pacing, ready to explode.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{oh jesus jesus...}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{he will know everything about you. everything. i know, because i've done it. once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. if you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and bain is good because i was the best and i couldn't take him.}
<A>__{she whirls and starts firing the gun, firing it everywhere, fear and anger rocketing out of her in whistling hot wads of lead. when she stops, he starts to say something but she levels the gun at him.}

<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i killed him.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rath}

<C>__{electra}
<D>__{where you wanted to be?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes. as soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top. that's all there is. until then, there is nothing. you are nothing.}
<C>__{electra}

<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you were like a boy genius?}

<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i was just different.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you went from high school to the agency?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no. i graduated from george washington university. then i entered the agency training program.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{they didn't give you a choice, did they?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no, they didn't.}
<C>__{electra}

<C>__{rath}
<D>__{of course. i was going to be james bond.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{ahhhh...}
<C>__{rath}

<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why not?}

<D>__{women... i don't... i don't want to talk about women.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{because you are a women.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why did you leave the agency?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{the same reason everyone does. you hear your name on c span and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{they tried to kill you?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes. it didn't matter much to them as long as i disappeared.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{then you went freelance?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{the only thing different about the private sector is that a general contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money. then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.}
<C>__{electra}

<D>__{because i want to know.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{it was... mechanical. very precise. it was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{are they usually like that?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no. just the first one.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{after that?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{they become complicated... messy.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{did it ever bother you?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{did it ever bother james bond?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{that's fiction.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{this is fiction! don't you see that? this is another reality. and the people that come into the world to play this game nobody forces them! they're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks! do you understand what i am saying? no one is innocent including you!}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{does that mean it didn't bother you?}
<A>__{rath leans back and stares at her. she waits.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you get a job swinging a hammer, the first day you get a blister, it tears open, it bleeds and it stays sore a long time. you keep swinging the hammer, you get a good hard callous that covers that spot and it never bothers you again.}

<C>__{rath}
<D>__{check.}
<A>__{he leans back.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{is that what you wanted to hear? something cold blooded... something remorseless...}

<D>__{this is fucking insane.}
<A>__{he grabs the empty plastic bottle, unzips his pants and begins refilling it. a man in a suit appears on the steps and bain fumbles the bottle, spilling it as he lifts the gun. it is not rath.}

<A>__{bain charges into the bank, tearing off his sunglasses, scanning the room. his face is a twisted grimace, streaked with black charcoal. his body and clothes are covered in sweat and large salt rings. his breathing labored. he sees rath sitting comfortably, calm, his suit not even wrinkled and realizes that rath has been waiting for him. his first instinct is to turn and run, but he stops himself. he is confused, unsure. then, as though understanding he has no choice, he puts his sunglasses back on and strides over to rath, boots clicking against the polished marble. bain sits down in the leather chair across from him.}

<C>__{rath}
<D>__{when you walked in here and you saw me, sitting here, waiting; the first thing that went through your head was that you were a dead man.}
<A>__{this catches bain's ear.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you're thinking that you've been sold out. that's the only way i could know you were out there. why would you think this? because you don't trust your contractor. you don't trust anyone. it's automatic. it's the first and last commandment. it's the only thing that keeps you alive. so, try as i might to tell you the truth, you can't believe me. do you see the irony of the situation? it's kind of funny, isn't it?}
<A>__{bain is not laughing.}
<L>__{interior burned hotel room}
<A>__{inside the burned out closet, electra finds bain's nylon duffel bag. digging through it, she finds his gameboy, his walkman, his .22, ammunition clips and several issues of soldier of fortune and a punisher comic book. the rifle is not here.}
<L>__{interior bank}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{listen to me, bain. two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where i was going to pick up the transferred money from microcell. you don't know how they got the information. it bothered you, but you didn't care. how do i know this? because ten years ago, i was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{i ain't scared of you.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yeah you are and you hate it. you hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't. that you're sweating your balls off and i'm not. you've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{if you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{all right, bain. pay attention, because this is where everything changes.}
<L>__{interior burned hotel}

<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you're a businessman, right? this is a business deal. behind that counter, i have over ten million dollars. i will give you half of it, more money than you'll make in the next ten years if, you walk away.}

<C>__{bain}

<D>__{what i just said, no assassin would say. what i've said, only a mark would say.}

<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you would be.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{you don't know a fucking thing about me. you don't have the slightest fucking clue.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{why don't you tell me.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{i will tell you this. after cleveland, i thought i was lucky to be alive. but now, here, i just realized that you were the lucky one.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{now i will tell you something. it wouldn't fucking matter if i offered you one hundred million dollars. you'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. and here i am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing i can think is that, in just a few minutes i'm going to take you.}
<A>__{bain jumps out of the seat.}

<C>__{electra}
<D>__{oh, god. i see it!}

<D>__{electra, listen! you have got to come to the bank for the money! the money!}
<A>__{she is not listening; she is rushing down the hall, back toward the stairs. just as she grabs the rail, she hears bain storming into the lobby below. she begins climbing the stairs, quickly but quietly. bain is a rampaging beast, lunging up the stairs.}

<A>__{the bank is almost empty. rath has begun to sweat.}

<L>__{interior burned hotel}
<A>__{electra turns into the hotel room just as bain reaches the fifth floor. there is no time. she slips into the closet, as bain whips around the corner into the room. he rushes to the window, slamming himself against it.}

<D>__{you're gonna take me? come on! come on, motherfucker!}
<A>__{he bends down and from the hole that he fell into, pulls out the assault rifle.}

<A>__{electra watches through the slits of the blackened wood lathe. he pounds his fist rapidly into his thigh and then through the wall.}

<A>__{it is happening as it happened ten years ago. rath knows that he is unable to stop it.}
<L>__{interior burned hotel}
<A>__{bain is rigid, cast in iron, the rifle rammed under his chin, sight tight to his eye, finger wrapped around the trigger. electra silently, ever so delicately opens her bag, lifting out her gun.}

<A>__{his eyes, his whole body comes to life.}
<L>__{interior burned hotel}
<A>__{bain is twisting in mid air, diving as she fires again, moving at him. a chunk of wood explodes as she misses. he falls, the burned floor shattering, charred joists shearing with the sound of breaking glass. she watches him fall through, hears him hit the floor below, ash and wood clattering around him. the gun trained on the hole, she peers over the edge, but he is gone.}

<C>__{bain}
<D>__{die, bitch!}
<A>__{he fires, finger pumping, bullets erupting through the floor around her feet. screaming, she leaps out of the room, into the hall. his shoulders oozing blood, bain clenches his teeth and rises, listening as she sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall. beneath, he moves to the railing and aims at the staircase, waiting, until electra freezes at the top of the stairs, realizing that they are exposed. she flashes her head, quickly dipping back as the wall is perforated with bullets.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{fuck! god damn bitch! what are you doing? i don't believe this is happening!}
<A>__{she can hear him coming, his voice echoing through the hollow building. she looks down the stairs, the hall, above; there is nowhere to go.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{you're dead! you're fucking dead! i'm going to kill you a hundred fucking times for this!}
<A>__{bain fires up at the ceiling, the bullet tearing through the floor, whizzing past electra's head. if she moves he'll know her position. he fires another. electra sinks down, her back against the wall and aims at the floor. another shot. she fires back. bain closes, as they both start firing, silenced weapons, flashing, pumping lead at unseen targets. her gun empties first. he laughs hearing the click.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{game over, bitch!}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{bain!}
<A>__{rath's scream echoes up through the building. before bain can target him, rath is gone; a shadow, a ghost. he scans the hotel's courtyard. the last light from the setting sun slips through the slits, cracks and broken window panes, casting patterns; a surreal dream like grid resembling a chess board. electra sees her chance. she leaps to her feet, throwing the gun over the balcony. the two men watch the gun clatter to the floor as she races back to the room.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{fuck no!}
<A>__{rath grabs the gun tracking bain hurling up the stairs to the fifth floor. rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun is empty.}

<D>__{electra!}
<A>__{bain explodes through the wall, charred wood and plaster flying. electra spins to shoot but the floor suddenly cracks open, swallowing her. limping, lurching up the stairs, rath hears the crash. jarred by the fall, electra drags herself away from the open ceiling.}

<D>__{the gun! he needs the gun! get rid of it! throw it!}
<A>__{she looks up for bain but he has again disappeared. she looks at the gun, thinking, turning it over in her hands. his leg soaked with blood, rath rumbles down the hall. black with soot, bain descends soundless, serpent like to the fourth level through another burned opening. electra moves towards the door aiming at every sound, at every dark corner. she is almost there when we see bain, a shadow coming to life, emerging behind her. lumbering, rath is halfway there, his eyes riveted on the door to room 502. hearing bain, electra turns. in one smooth motion, he snatches her arm and breaks her wrist. the gun falls. rath hears her scream. electra kicks at his groin but he drops, leg sweeping her to the ground. she gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face, jack knifing her body back, knocking her unconscious. bain grabs the gun. rath whips into the room blasting bullets chasing bain as he disappears into a blackened hole. rath goes to electra not knowing if she is alive or dead. gently he turns her, cradling her head, her face, smeared with blood. from within the labyrinth, rath hears bain begin to laugh.}
