<A>__{close full shot of the klingon ship being destroyed (as seen on viewer) (o) (in the last part of the scene which showed the klingon captain speaking in klingonese and an english print out interpretation appearing at the screen bottom. the klingon ship nearly totaled; one engine nacelle gone, smoke and flame spewing from the other, etc. and then that final whiplash energy bolt striking and spectacularly destroying the ship, etc.) but this time, o.s., we hear gasps of incredulity from many throats (an audience), and various ad libbed com ments: "my god...!" "i don't believe it...!" "what could it be...?" etc., etc. and then, immediately following this, on the viewer: the luminescent cloud (as seen on a viewer) (o) (as in earlier epsilon 9 viewer but with no music, only more ad libbed exclamations from an audience.) the viewer goes blank.}
