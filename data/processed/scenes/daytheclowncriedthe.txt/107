<A>__{it is the next morning. light is coming from the vents and the lantern which hangs from a peg in the middle of the right side of the car. helmut is asleep on the floor with the children huddled around him. he lies on his side with one arm thrown protectively over the little czech girl, inga, and willie. behind him, the czech birthday boy and the girl with the doll are cuddled close to him. other youngsters have their heads on his legs and feet, and all are as close to him as they can get. he is, in fact, a sort of human bed. from the train noises o.s. we can tell that the freight train is slowing down. then, with a jolt, it stops, and o.s. we hear a truck engine approaching. helmut stirs and sits up, trying to get his bearings. this arouses some of the children and they too sit up and look around.}
