<L>__{interior bouley restaurant, new york night}
<A>__{dim lighting, crowd buzz, a long line of the rich, the celebrated, the congenitally impatient. everyone in this queue holds a reservation at least an hour overdue. tourists can't even make the line. pan ahead to... ... the burnished dining room, the tables of power, the elegant service. covertly, many eyes are drawn to the one table receiving by far the most lavish service of all. captains hover, presenting delicacies, pouring wines, murmuring obsequiously to a guest whose person they screen from our view. we can see, however... ... the honored guest's companion. ignored, bemused, across the table. this is digger downes, 36, darkly attractive. kind eyes, an intellectual's mouth, saville row's most unobtrusive and conservative chalk stripe suit. he is gay, but you wouldn't guess it. loyal and wise and generous, and you might. he watches with a quiet twinkle, as the captains now step back, revealing to us... ... their most unlikely icon. julianne potter, almost 28, wears her favorite bulky sweater over a bunch of other stuff she pulled together in fifteen seconds. she is unkempt, quick, volatile, scattered, and beneath it all, perhaps because of it all, an original beauty. dark liquid eyes, a cynical mouth, slender expressive fingers, which point to...}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{a variation on our squid ink risotto. trace of moselle, to sweeten the stock.}
<A>__{she doesn't like that idea at all. shoots him a sharp look of doubt that makes him smile. murmur...}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{don't kill us on this one, it's a long shot.}
<A>__{places the moist lump of black rice before her. she takes a surprisingly small amount, rolls it over her tongue. makes dead flat eye contact with digger. and nods, it's actually quite nice. the captain breathes with relief. she turns her dark eyes to him. the tone says they're pals...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i'm writing it up as inventive and confident. which it is. off the record, i will need an extra boat of the ink. or a salt shaker.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{i will toss a coin.}
<A>__{as the captain splits, digger looks around at the other tables, which makes many pairs of eyes awkwardly glace away.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{if your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good writer of note.}
<A>__{she glances at her two remaining waiters, who shamelessly fawn nearby.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{i've adjusted, and thanks for asking.}
<A>__{she leans forward, as if sharing something conspiratorial.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{see the pull of a book like twenty chefs, is not who i put in. it's who i leave out.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{which is everyone you couldn't get in.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{plus some guys whose food i don't like.}
<A>__{pushes the risotte across to him. he lifts a fork.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{this fellow from newsday ever call?}
<A>__{she shrugs. pulls a cellular out of a large, jumbled bag.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i will buzz my machine. inventive and confident, yeh?}
<A>__{she dials. he tastes.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{needs salt.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{is newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{... i don't send you men, anymore. you don't know what to do with them.}
<A>__{she's punching in her code.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{sometimes i do. like for two months.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{... weeks.}
<A>__{over the phone, we hear her answering machine...}
<P>__{man's voice (v.o., soft)}
<D>__{hey. it's michael.}
<A>__{and her face changes. warms. just to hear the guileless voice.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{god, it must be, what, months, huh? i can't wait to talk to you. i'm in chicago at the ritz carlton...}
<A>__{she looks impressed and surprised. fancy place for this guy.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{call me four in the morning, whatever, we gotta talk.}
<A>__{as she hangs up. she still has that look in her eye. digger has never seen that, and he likes it very much.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{who called? the man of the moment?}
<A>__{she smiles. a sweet, natural smile that makes us like her, too. the bohemian sophisticate has vanished.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{no, no, the opposite. that's my best friend, michael o'neal. he sounds desperate to talk.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{the wandering sportswriter.}
<A>__{he pushes the risotto back her way.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{i didn't know you two had a past.}
<A>__{her gaze sharpens. hmmn?}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{the look in your eye.}
<A>__{she blushes. shakes her head, no way.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{sophomore year at yale we had this one hot month. and, you know me, i got restless...}
<A>__{he knows her. she got restless.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{so i get up the nerve to break his heart. i tell him there's this dreamy exchange student from pakistan who wants to, you know...}
<A>__{he knows.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{and he gets this... look. he says, "i knew i couldn't hold your interest", which, of course, makes me feel like the shallow bitch i've always been...}
<A>__{he nods, yeah.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{then he says, "but what makes me want to cry. is i'm losing the best friend i ever had."}
<A>__{hears the feeling. in her voice.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{and when he said it, i knew. i felt the same.}
<A>__{silence now. she covers with a smile.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{so i cried. for maybe the third time in my life. and i kissed him. and we've been best friends ever since.}
<A>__{ever since. fingers turning her wine glass...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{nine years, we've seen each other through everything. losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times. the best times of my life, maybe. just drinking and talking. even over a phone.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{kindred spirits.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{no, he's nothing like me. he's like you. only straight.}
<A>__{no offense taken.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{he's the salt of the earth. kind and loyal and generous. the one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{he's still in love with you.}
<A>__{that stops her. she has to say...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{maybe. but it never gets in the way.}
<A>__{something she probably hasn't confessed out loud before. digger understands.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{well, he has a true friend in you.}
<A>__{he wants her to know he sees that.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{whenever george tells someone how steadfast i am, he always makes me sound boring.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{solid and genuine is not boring. michael can be completely insane...}
<A>__{a young waiter arrives. sets a boat of black squid ink beside her plate.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{there was this one night in tucson, like six years ago... we got amazingly drunk, i mean, keith richards time...}
<A>__{the kid tops off her glass of meursault. looking at her.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{god, i haven't thought of this in so long...}
<A>__{the waiter hanging now. openly listening.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i can even believe we did this...}
<A>__{digger sees the guy listening, gestures to her with his eyes. so she looks up.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{could you give us a minute?}
<A>__{the kid stunned, speechless. people lose jobs for a lot less.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{you won't miss much, i promise there was no sex.}
<A>__{he reddens and disappears.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{i've lost interest.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{he takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...}
<A>__{she places the tips of her index fingers together.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{blood oath.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{he says, "swear. when we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"}
<A>__{and laughs again. can you believe that? but digger isn't smiling. she wonders why. begins to spoon black squid ink onto her risotto.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{see, he figured that would be a sign from god, or someone of comparable authority, that we'd misunderstood our destinies.}
<A>__{he still has this real serious look. she's still spooning ink.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{we never talked about it again. i don't know what made me think of...}
<C>__{digger }
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{and everything. stops. she lifts her spoon, mesmerized by the gravity of his tone.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{you'll be 28 in three weeks. how old is he?}
<A>__{holy. fucking. shit. it hits her like a ton of lead bricks. she shovels some swampy risotto into her mouth, without looking.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{you think...}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{desperate. to talk.}
<A>__{she shovels in more drippy black goop. it is really disgusting.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{he's not proposing marriage, there's no way i'm buying one word of th...}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{then why are you compulsively eating? if you're not hysterical?}
<A>__{more goes in. her lips and mouth completely black. like a circus clown.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{he can't do that to me!}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{we're about to find out.}
<A>__{ink is now dribbling out of the black hole of her mouth and down her face. she absently dabs a napkin, keeping some of it from reaching her sweater.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{when i turn him down...}
<A>__{she realizes the full weight of the truth.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{we'll never be the same.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{i have a suggestion...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i will have to kill myself before i call him.}
<A>__{staring in each other's eyes.}
<C>__{digger }
<D>__{that was it.}
