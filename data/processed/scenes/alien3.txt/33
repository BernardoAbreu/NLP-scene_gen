<L>__{interior corridor prison level night}
<A>__{a long, twisted plank floored corridor with a torch every twenty feet. there is movement at the far end. something is coming towards us flickering in and out of the light and shadow }
<D>__{ripley o s sheep?}
<A>__{ripley, john and anthony running together. anthony carries a long wooden staff like a spear. john has his bag. ripley a torch. we move with them.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{it must be able to take on some of the characteristics of the animal it grows in. maybe they are from some sort of aggressive soldier race warring parties drop the eggs on opposing planets }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{and the alien takes on the form of the creature that finds it, assuming that animal is the dominant life form on the planet. so when it gestates in a man }
<A>__{ripley shudders at the memory.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{it's a biped. in a sheep or cow, a quadroped.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{shit. i just didn't think it could do that to animals.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{wait a minute i thought you were the expert on this monster.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{is that the only reason you came to get me out? because i knew about this thing?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yes. i mean no. i mean, that was part of it. look. i never thought you were wrong. i was wrong not to say anything. i was afraid to speak up. it's hard to be a monk, you know?}
<A>__{ripley stops. looks at him. a long beat.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{thank you. if anything, you're honest.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we all are. took vows.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i don't know about the abbot.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm sure he thinks what he did was right.}
