<D>__{i dismissed your stories. told you to grow up.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{then i saw her for myself.}
<A>__{she looks to elise, who nods. hand trembling, lorraine retrieves a packet from within her coat. the paper is yellowing. faded. soaked from the rain. lorraine hands the packet to josh, who is dumbfounded. renai peers over josh's shoulder, at a polaroid of a boy, about nine years old, sitting on a couch. early 70s period. it is a young josh. behind him is the blurred outline of a}

<A>__{josh runs his finger over the shadow. his heart rate speeds up. an old memory is coming back to him.}
<C>__{lorraine }
<D>__{at first, i thought it was a camera problem. then i saw her again.}
<A>__{josh flips to the next photo it is another faded frame of josh as a youngster. this time he stands in an old kitchen. once again, there is a figure behind him clearer this time, but still hidden in silhouette. a step closer to josh. josh flips to the next picture. a black and white shot of himself as a young boy, lying in bed. with dread, josh sees the unmistakable features of an old woman, crouching beside his bed. staring at him.}
<C>__{lorraine }
<D>__{in each photo, she got closer and closer to you...}
<A>__{josh flips to the next picture in this one, young josh is standing by a car. behind him, the details of the old woman's dress are visible. her arm is extended...reaching out for josh's neck. renai's hand flies to her mouth.}
<C>__{lorraine }
<D>__{finally, i was so scared, i called elise.}
<A>__{sweat pours down josh's brow. he lets the photographs flutter from his fingers, backing away. fragments of memories rock his entire body.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{i don't...i don't remember any of this...}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{you've blocked it out.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but in the back of your mind, you're still afraid of having your picture taken, aren't you?}
<A>__{josh grabs the wall, weak at the knees.}
<C>__{lorraine}
<D>__{i've kept the photos hidden ever since then...until tonight.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i advised lorraine to hide them. to stop taking your picture. and to let you forget.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{who is she?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{a parasite. she befriended your astral body, then drew you out into the further, just as dalton has been drawn out.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{but she deceived you. all she wanted was an empty vessel. a physical body. yours.}
<C>__{lorraine}
<D>__{i'm sorry, josh.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i didn't want to make you remember this...i only do it for the sake of your son.}
<A>__{a quiet descends over them.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{your son is out there.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and you are the only one who can bring him back.}
<A>__{josh looks up at her.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{how long do we have before...that thing...takes him over completely?}
<A>__{all eyes are on elise.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{if you cannot reach him tonight, then he is gone forever.}
