<D>__{all right, stand by there. we're on out way. over.}
<A>__{the beam of ripley's light wavers hypnotically in the tunnel ahead. she blinks, seeing something...not sure. a glinting obscene form moving toward them, filling the tunnel at the absolute limit of the light's power.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{back. go back!}
<A>__{they try to crawl back, jamming together. behind them, the way they have come, a grating is battered in with a ferocious clang and the deadly silhouette of a warrior flows into the duct. they are trapped. vasquez uses her flamethrower, bathing the tunnel in fire. hicks snaps out his hand welder and cuts into the wall of the duct. molten metal spatters him, as sparks fill the tunnel with lurid light. vasquez' flamethrower sputters.}

<P>__{(icy)}
<D>__{losing fuel.}
<A>__{between eye searing bursts of flame ripley sees the glistening apparitions closing in. hicks' torch feathers out. empty. bracing his back he kicks hard at the cherry hot metal. it bends aside. beyond is a narrow service way, lined with pipes and conduit. hicks slides through the searing hole, lifting newt safely through as ripley hands her out. ripley follows and turns to help gorman. vasquez' flamethrower goes dry. she draws her service pistol. suddenly she looks up as a warrior screeches down from a vertical shaft, right above her. she fires with incredible rapidity...bam! bam! bam! rolls aside. it lands on her legs and she snaps her head to one side just as its tail stinger buries into the metal wall beside her cheek. she fires again, emptying the pistol, kicking the thrashing shape away. acid cuts through her chickenplate armor, searing into her thigh. she cries out, gritting her teeth against the white hot pain. gorman sees vasquez hit, unable to move. sees the creatures coming the other way...and turns away from the escape hole. he crawls back to her, grabs her battle harness and starts dragging her towards safety. too late. the approaching alien warriors have reached and passed the opening. vasquez sees him, barely conscious.}

<P>__{(hoarse whisper)}
<D>__{you always were an asshole, gorman.}
<A>__{she seizes his hand in a deadly drip, but we recognize it as the "power greeting" she shared with drake... something for the chosen few. gorman returns the grip. he hands her two grenades and arms two himself as the creatures are upon them.}
