<L>__{interior bruce's castle bedchamber night}
<A>__{robert the bruce is in bed with a young nordic beauty with vacant blue eyes. she drowses; but the lovemaking has not defused the restlessness of robert's spirit. he lies on his stomach, turned away from her on the bed. stirring, she kisses his neck; but he doesn't respond.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i wanted to please you.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{you did.}
<A>__{but he is numb as she nuzzles him again. she sags back, and he still stares away, lost in thought. realizing her hurt, he explains...}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{in lanark village, the king's soldiers killed a girl. her lover fought his way through the soldiers and killed the magistrate.}
<A>__{she looks at him blankly.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{he rebelled. he rebelled. he acted. he fought! was it rage? pride? love? whatever it was, he has more of it than i.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{you might have lied.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i'm too arrogant to lie.}
<A>__{close robert the bruce on his face as he moves grimly up a dark castle staircase. he follows a servant who carries a candle against the gloom. they reach a door, which the servant unlocks. young robert takes the candle, and enters }
<B>__{a darkened room}
<A>__{robert wills himself forward, and places the candle on a table in the center of the room. a shuffle in the dark; then moving into the light is a leper whose once noble features are decaying with the disease. isolated in his disfiguration, he looks at his visitor his son with the eyes of the condemned. young robert forces himself not to look away.}
<C>__{robert the bruce}
<D>__{father. a rebellion has begun.}
<C>__{the leper}
<D>__{under whom?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{a commoner named william wallace.}
<C>__{the leper}
<D>__{a commoner? so no one leads scotland?}
<A>__{the old man thinks, and points a half finger at his son.}
<C>__{the leper}
<D>__{you will embrace this rebellion. support it, from our lands in the north. i will gain english favor by condemning it and ordering it opposed from our lands in the south. whichever way the tide runs, we will rise.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{this wallace. he doesn't even have a knighthood. but he fights with passion, and he is clever. he inspires men.}
<C>__{the leper}
<D>__{you admire him. uncompromising men are easy to admire. he has courage. so does a dog. but you must understand this: edward longshanks is the most ruthless king ever to sit on the throne of england, and none of us, and nothing of scotland, will survive unless we are as ruthless, more ruthless, than he.}
<A>__{young bruce rises heavily, and moves to the door.}
<C>__{the leper}
<D>__{press your case to the nobles. they will choose who rules scotland.}
<A>__{with a last long look at his father, robert leaves.}
