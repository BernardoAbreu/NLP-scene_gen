<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{i was raised in a baptist church got dipped in the water when i was 5 born again before kindergarten... by the time i was 10 i knew it was bullshit and at 15 i ran away from home...}
<A>__{she smiles at the most painful memories.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{pregnant, had an abortion, got pregnant again, had an abortion again... gave up men. tried women. missed men. my mother died.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i bought a car for $200 and drove to ft. lauderdale to bury her.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and after we'd sung some hymns in some wretched florida funeral home, i went outside and something happened }
<A>__{her tone becomes wistful, nostalgic.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{the smell of cut grass in the warm march air overwhelmed me and i heard a noise }
<P>__{(makes the sound))}
<D>__{ tok, tok, tok and some men shouting... then tok, tok, tok.}
<A>__{crash smiles slightly. he knows.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i crossed the street it was the new york yankees spring training field tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat and i sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i saw him.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{thurman munson.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody it was beautiful...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so i stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{what's so great about baseball?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{if you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{don't you see? if you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{i don't know if i'd go that far.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it's true, it's true!}
<P>__{(beat, down)}
<D>__{least it used to be true. it ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, crash?}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{it's possible.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well... i used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to. lately i'm not so sure.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{whatta you mean "why not"? are you gonna play forever?!}
<A>__{before crash can answer suddenly a voice interrupts. they both turn to see: millie excitedly dragging jimmy into the nearly empty bar. she leads him by the hand.}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{annie, annie! there she is we've been looking all over for ya. hi crash.}
<A>__{millie leads jimmy right up to their table. and as they hold hands. jimmy stands there shyly.}
