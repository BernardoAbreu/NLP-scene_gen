<A>__{jack, at a mirror wearing the zegna suit. it is perfect for his frame. the color is spectacular, the line is dazzling. jack looks in the mirror, shutting everything else out... its like hes seeing his old self...}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{you look amazing in that suit...}
<A>__{jack snaps out of his trance. he sees kate standing behind him, annie and josh happily playing a few feet away.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i mean...wow...off the charts great.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{its an unbelievable thing. wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.}
<P>__{(taking one final look)}
<D>__{im gonna buy it...}
<A>__{kate raises an eyebrow, then looks at the price tag.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{$2,400?! are you out of your mind?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(pointing to annies new mary janes)}
<D>__{she got those shoes...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{those shoes were twenty five dollars. cmon, take it off. well go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.}
<A>__{jack looks at her...its a moment of decision.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{kate looks at jack, a little surprised.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{do you have any idea what my life is like?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...i drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, kate.}
<A>__{kate just stands here, aghast...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...i play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that i always have to drive everyone everywhere? i spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini van listening to raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...im sick of it.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{whats in it for me? where are my mary janes?}
<A>__{kate stares at him, shaking her head...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i cant believe its not a disappointment to you!}
<P>__{(letting it all out)}
<D>__{jesus, kate, i couldve been a thousand times the man i became. how could you do this to me? how could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!}
<A>__{kate stares at him in disbelief. then...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{kates words pierce jack...he has to avert his eyes.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(lowering his voice)}
<D>__{look, im sorry. im sorry i was such a saint before and im such a prick now. maybe im just not the same guy i was when we got married...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{maybe youre not. the jack campbell i married wouldnt need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thats what its gonna take, then buy it. just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund.}
<A>__{they stare at each other for a moment...a stand off...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{forget it...}
<P>__{(taking off the jacket)}
<D>__{well get a funnel cake. itll be the highlight of my week...}
