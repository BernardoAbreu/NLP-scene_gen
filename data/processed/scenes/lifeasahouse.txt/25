<A>__{sam rushes over to the window and stares down at the screen and ladder. ryan, adam and their friends are still in the pool, holding onto the coping, staring up at sam. sam slams the window shut and searches for the can of whipping cream. he gets down on his knees to search under the bed. standing and making one more pass of the room, he notices the can in the trash. he instantly focuses all his rage at the closed door.}
