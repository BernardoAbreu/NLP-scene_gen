<L>__{int basement, annina's day (later)}
<A>__{grandmaster flash's "white lines" fills the room. the walls are covered with half finished, unstretched canvases. two or three more lie on the floor. he works like a maniac, buzzing back and forth from one painting to another, adding figures, crossing out words, all the while smoking and eating cookies. the crumbs fall onto the paintings. he walks on them. every so often, he refers to a book of davinci drawings. torn pages litter the floor beneath the book. we hear someone thumping down the stairs. it's rene. a puppy follows him. he dumps a huge load of paint supplies, art books, and carryout ribs. the puppy sniffs around happily, licking at jean and walking over the paintings, wagging his tail. he stops the tape player and inserts some persian music. jean empties some foil wrapped bags of coke. he cuts a line of coke on a foil plate. rene starts reading from a poem he's evidently written:}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{3rd night i called him 'boy' he sed "don't call me 'boy'" "well then don't call me 'boss'" that was the end for us and i've been seeing him for 2 1 2 years. in kangaroo court i want to be able to say i never kept a slave. but he tricked me in to tying him up and busting his face. he'll jump up at my trial yelling 'he wupped me gud.'}
<A>__{jean warms the plate 'til the coke crackles, and then "chases the dragon," sucking the smoke through a straw. he offers it to rene, who refuses. he lights and hands rene the jointerior rene takes a hit. jean takes it back. jean starts to work again. the puppy runs around, chasing after him, getting in his way, running across the paintings. jean laughs, playing tag. the puppy gets a hold of jean's sleeve. it unravels about ten feet. while jean's playing, rene spots a painting with the words "famous negro athletes."}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{oh man! that's one looks famous already.}
<A>__{without hearing him, jean walks towards the painting and with a swipe, paints out what rene is pointing to.}
<C>__{rene }
<D>__{you are a willful boy. how'm i s'posed to write about you if you keep changing everything?}
<A>__{the phone rings... jean ignores it. rene gets it }
<C>__{rene }
<D>__{uh huhh... band practice?}
<P>__{(to jean)}
<D>__{it's benny. he wants to know why you're not at band practice...?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{fuck...}
<P>__{(to rene)}
<D>__{i forgot about that.}
<A>__{he sets his brush down. rene hold the phone against his leg.}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{fuck band practice... if you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts you don't wanna be like tony bennett..}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{tony bennett... what do you mean?}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{singing on stage and painting in your spare time.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{i didn't know tony bennett painted.}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{my point exactly.}
<A>__{jean picks up the phone... all he hears is a dial tone.}
<C>__{rene }
<D>__{so keep painting.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{yes, boss.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{you're news. i want the scoop. i write it down. when i speak, no one believes me. but when i write it down, people know it's true.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{so shut up and keep painting..}
<C>__{basquiat}
<P>__{(touched)}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{5:11.}
<A>__{jean regards a near finished painting. he writes "5:11" on it. he crosses it out and re writes it, "rene 5:11." rene looks pleased.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{that one's for you.}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{thanks... i will take it tonight.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{i can't. after the show.}
<A>__{jean continues painting. rene slumps down onto the floor, happy a parasite content to have a host, impressed with jean's limitless energy. rene closes his eyes.}
