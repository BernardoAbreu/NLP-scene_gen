<L>__{ext observatory sky day}
<A>__{uberman soars high above the clouds. he looks down at the observatory, which is a mere speck in the distance.}
<D>__{master mind (cont'd v.o) (cont'd) then you must have flown to a safe distance and waited for the explosion, then...}
<A>__{just as the observatory explodes uberman aims and throws the skeleton like a javelin. it soars through the air like a missile, tearing through the flames of the explosion, and crashing right into the windshield of master mind's hydrofoil.}
<B>__{end of flashback}
<A>__{wayne stares at master mind, clearly impressed.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{man, you are smart.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{but why fake your death? why go through all of it? you could have just quit.}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{but the responsibility would still be there.}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{a cop can retire and stop handing out speeding tickets but people expect more from superheroes. i tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt in zimbabwe without everyone expecting me to do something about it. i figured, out of sight, out of mind.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{and wayne scott? why did he have to disappear?}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{both of my lives have so much baggage. it's time for new baggage, you know?}
<A>__{master mind's is absolutely flabbergasted.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i just can't believe it. this whole time you've been in hiding while a force of great evil is tearing your city apart?}
<A>__{wayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for master mind to say no more.}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{i don't want to hear about it. that's why i don't have a television in here to remind me of all the things i should be doing. hell, i could get a wife to do that.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{there's a demented supervillain out there about to destroy our i mean, your city.}
<A>__{wayne shrugs indifferently.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{you're really going to do nothing?}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{good and evil have a way of balancing themselves out. if this guy is as bad as you say, somebody will rise up to fight him. it's just the order of things. you found me, didn't you?}
<A>__{wayne puts a condescending hand on master mind's shoulder.}
<C>__{wayne scott }
<D>__{i know it's hard, but you'll find someone else someday.}
<A>__{he then starts walking to the door.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{you're the only one who can stop him.}
<A>__{wayne turns around.}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{couldn't if i wanted to. gotta a plane to catch.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{a plane?}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{going to barbados for a little change in climate. now, if you'll excuse me, i got to go pack.}
<A>__{he reads the still defeated look on master mind's face.}
<C>__{wayne scott }
<D>__{you were a good foe. i'm sorry if i've let you down. if it makes a difference, you were the best foe a hero could ask for.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{not smart enough to come up with a full proof trap.}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{well, you did almost have me when you figured out my weakness was copper. now that made me sweat a little. took me way too long to drill out from under that cage.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i got lucky.}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{anyway, it's a good thing for my sake that i could always count on you for an out.}
<C>__{master mind}
<P>__{(suddenly confused)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{c'mon, we always threw each other a couple of bones. you would always leave me an out in one of your `full proof' traps, and i'd never had you incarcerated at a penitentiary that you couldn't eventually escape from. it kept our little game going.}
<A>__{master mind seems deflated.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{game? was that all this ever was to you? you know, i was trying my best every time i fought you. those `outs' as you call them were unintentional.}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i guess i was never really a match for you, was i?}
<A>__{wayne shrugs.}
<C>__{master mind }
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{then how can i expect to be one for titan?}
<A>__{a beaten man, master mind heads for the door, but stops and turns around.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{what about roxanne?}
<A>__{wayne unleashes an exhausted sigh.}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{i think we both got what we wanted out of our relationship. she got a career out of me, and i got plenty of other things out of her. but i'm ready to move on to greener pastures.}
<A>__{master mind's steel hand clinches into a fist at his side. wayne's oblivious to this.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i guess i wasn't the villain i thought i was, and you...you weren't the hero i thought you were.}
<A>__{he turns to make his exit when he suddenly sees roxanne}
<B>__{standing in the door frame.}
<A>__{wayne is almost at a loss for words.}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{roxanne! how long have you been...}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{long enough.}
<A>__{roxanne looks at master mind.}
<C>__{roxanne }
<D>__{don't you have something else you can go do?}
<A>__{master mind leaves roxanne and wayne facing each other in silence.}
