<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the entrance to the st. regis hotel, elegant and warmly lit in the night. pedestrians pass. baroque harpsichord music plays over the scene. the camera moves up the hotel's facade, past its welcoming flags, to its ornate windows several floors up. as the harpsichord continues to play, the film moves inside, to one of the hotel rooms. elliot, his back to the camera, is opening the door to lee. elliot closes the door behind her as she enters. they stand very close to each other, framed by the door and a stark, subtly striped wallpapered wall.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(looking intensely at lee, his hands in his pockets)}
<D>__{i thought you weren't coming.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i almost didn't.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(putting his hand on}
<D>__{her shoulder, wanting}
<P>__{to kiss her)}
<D>__{lee... uh...}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i didn't sleep all night.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(taking his hand}
<D>__{away, gesturing to}
<P>__{the room)}
<D>__{no, no no no, i'm sure.}
<A>__{they walk towards the camera, further into the room. elliot puts his arm around lee.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{what are we doing, meeting in a hotel room? it's terrible, isn't it?}
<A>__{the music stops. the camera follows lee as she walks towards the curtained windows, past a fireplace, a mirror, some innocuous pictures, a delicate table holding a lamp, the foot of the bed.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{i i couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i promised myself i wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone. i was so torn when you called.}
<A>__{she parts a corner of the curtains, looking out the window, turning when elliot speaks.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{i've wanted to call you everyday since i first told you how i felt.}
<A>__{he walks over to lee by the curtained windows.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{i resisted so many times.}
<P>__{(pausing)}
<D>__{don't think badly of me.}
<A>__{he takes lee into his arms.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{this is not an easy situation.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i know it isn't.}
<A>__{they kiss, their figures almost silhouetted in the warm glow of the room. elliot takes lee's coat off without breaking the kiss. they embrace. they kiss each other lightly, then stronger, more passionately, their embrace much tighter. and it's later that night. the harpsichord music begins to play again as the camera moves over the bed covers to reveal lee, lying contentedly under the sheets, her hair fanned out on the pillows, one arm near her head.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{that was just perfect. you've ruined me for anyone else.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{i don't want anyone else ever to have you.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{i was so worried i wouldn't compare with hannah.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(offscreen, laughing)}
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<A>__{he enters the screen, sitting down on the edge of the bed next to lee. he holds a cigarette.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{you really do have those thoughts, don't you?}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(chuckling, touching elliot's arm)}
<D>__{oh, all the time.}
<A>__{elliot chuckles; they hold hands.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i know she must be a really passionate person.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(looking at their clasped hands)}
<D>__{yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it it's me that wants to be giving to you. i i i want to do things for you. hannah doesn't need me as much.}
<P>__{(chuckling as lee laughs)}
<D>__{i'm being presumptuous. not that you need me.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{i want you to take care of me... and i love when you do things to me.}
<A>__{elliot leans down to lee; they begin to kiss passionately.}
