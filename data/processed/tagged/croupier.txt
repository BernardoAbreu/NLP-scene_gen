<A>__{jack nods.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{he knew the scam. come in with five grand cash. no questions asked. launder it by getting a casino cheque when you cash in. jack wondered why mr reynolds permitted it? after all there's was no profit in it for the casino. or was there?}
<L>__{interior casino roulette table night}
<A>__{later. a different set of punters. the wheel spins. a greek man sits at the table. he doesn't attempt to bet. he looks around to see a croupier in his late 20's waiting to replace jack at the wheel. this is matt. he gives jack a curious complicitous smile. jack collects the chips and pays out.}

<D>__{turn left at the lights.}
<A>__{they drive off.}
<L>__{exterior street dawn}
<A>__{a deserted intersection. the austin healey swings around a corner. a woman steps out from the kerb.}
<L>__{interior car dawn}
<A>__{jack reacts. he swings the wheel. lucy shouts. the car swerves, missing the woman.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{hey! i saw her!}
<A>__{jack looks back. the woman is shouting after the car.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{you don't trust women drivers, do you?}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{jack didn't trust anyone. except himself.}
<L>__{interior jack's flat dawn}
<A>__{jack sits at his computer. he is watching the printer unloading page after page. jack assembles the typescript.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{it was finally finished. he thought of sending it to giles. but that wouldn't be right. he would select a publisher at random, like a number.}
<A>__{close up: the dedication: 'to marion'. the sound of the ball bouncing against the wheel.}
<L>__{interior casino night}
<A>__{the ball falls into 10. jack puts the doll on 10. no one at the table has the winning number. jack sweeps away the losing bets.}
<L>__{interior casino night}
<A>__{a blackjack table. the bets are placed. jack turns over the bank's cards: a king and an ace. he takes all the chips from the five punters.}
<C>__{punter}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{you're wasting yourself. with your luck you ought to come over to our side.}
<L>__{exterior street. bookstore night}
<A>__{jack comes up to a bookstore window. a sticker reads: 'it's a winner'. there are quotes blown up from the reviews: "an incredible inside job...it's all here, the systems, the scams, the sleaze...a tale of triumphant disgust...of exhilarating contempt..." the display is just one book: 'i, croupier'. number 1 bestseller.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{even his publisher had no idea who the author was. he had done the deal through a lawyer. it gave him a good feeling, no one knowing...}
<L>__{interior reynolds's office night}
<A>__{reynolds is reading the book. he laughs out loud at something.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{...it never occurred to anyone at the casino that the golden lion had been his model. why should it? weren't all casinos the same....}
<L>__{interior underground night}
<A>__{jack is sitting in his croupier's suit on the crowded tube. he sees a woman reading 'i, croupier'. for the first time we see the back cover...'by anonymous'.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{...it gave him an exquisite pleasure, being an underground man. with all his money, he hadn't even bought a car. jack knew the truth about himself, he was a one book writer. a one time winner who had quit while he was ahead...}
<L>__{interior jack's flat dawn}
<A>__{five in the morning.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{he changed nothing in the flat, bought nothing, spent nothing. the only thing he did was to remove the bars outside the window...}
<A>__{jack comes in. the phone rings.}
<L>__{interior sun city. casino night}
<A>__{jani is holding a mobile phone. in the background is the casino room, the lights, colours, rattling sounds. she waits.}

<C>__{jani}
<D>__{yes. i'm all over that now. jack, hold on a minute. there's someone here who wants to talk to you...}
<A>__{jack waits.}

<L>__{interior casino night}
<A>__{jack sr. his arm round jani, talks into the phone.}
<C>__{jack sr}
<D>__{i never thanked you properly for your help. jani told me you behaved like a perfect gentleman throughout. i knew you would. i know my son.}
<L>__{interior jack's flat night}
<A>__{jack's face is a mask, tight, fixed.}
<C>__{jack sr's voice}
<D>__{the woman thinks i'm going to marry her. but you know me. it's a shame things didn't work out. but we saw you all right. you didn't gamble the ten grand, did you?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(huskily)}
<D>__{as a matter of fact i did. but i won.}
<C>__{jack sr's voice}
<D>__{that's my boy. how's that novel of yours coming along?}
<A>__{jack slowly puts the phone down. he takes a deep breath. then smiles.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{so that was it. the final card. blackjack. his father, eight thousand miles and twenty seven years away, was still dealing to his son jack from the bottom of the deck...}
<A>__{close up: a copy of the book: 'i croupier'.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{...but jake the croupier had a sense of humour.}
<L>__{interior jack's kitchen night}
<A>__{laughing, jack pours himself a vodka, raises his glass.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{to you. to both of you.}
<A>__{he drinks at a gulp. he turns. standing in the doorway is bella, wearing a nightdress. she is sleepy.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{what are you laughing at? who was that on the phone?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a couple i know are getting married.}
<A>__{bella puts her arms around him lovingly.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{fools.}
<A>__{a whistling sound...}
<L>__{interior casino night}
<A>__{we are back in the first scene. the ball bounces around the spinning wheel. the faces of the punters. frozen expressions. they are almost still. we do not see the croupier. then...}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{now he had reached the point where he no longer heard the sound of the ball...}
<A>__{nothing moves except the little white ball in the spinning wheel. the ball slows...}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{...the spin of the wheel had brought him home to the place where he was born.}
<A>__{jack's face. a hint of a smile.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{the croupier's mission was accomplished.}
<A>__{the ball falls into green zero. jack rakes all the chips off the table. there are no winners. the film ends on a close up of jack's face. a look of calm satisfaction.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{at last he was master of the game. he had aquired the power... to make you lose.}
<T>__{fade out:}
<B>__{the end}
