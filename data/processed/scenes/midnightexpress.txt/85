<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{billy in his bed. the usual uproar. the attendant comes by with the pills, offers a handful to billy.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{hop! hop! take!}
<A>__{he takes them, puts a few into his mouth, swallows. reflective, unsure. a radio playing off blares suddenly with the u.s. armed forces station janis joplin singing "take another piece of my heat now, baby" then it's switched back to a turkish station, loud. billy rises. billy enters the toilet with the photo album tightly clutched under his arm. a dark stone room, very shadowy. piles of waste on the floor. a vacant eyed barefoot lunatic shuffles past billy who goes to one of the four partitioned holes cut into the floor. another angle billy squats over it and with his filthy long nails he starts to slit open the back binder of the album susan gave him. flickering shadows. he looks up absently. three lunatic faces stare in at him through wooden slats, tongues hanging out and drooling playing with themselves }
<B>__{off.}
<A>__{billy makes a lunatic face and scream kicking at the partition.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!}
<A>__{the lunatics, petrified, scatter off but one lunatic skids in a puddle of urine and crashes onto the tile howling. billy slits open the binder to reveal ten hundred dollar bills with pictures of mr. franklin' neatly inserted.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{billy has no particular expression on his face. reflective, staring at the money; he looks up. a large silhouette is moving towards him. billy just watches, transfixed, not trying to hide the money. hamidou comes into a faint light, looking down at him; glances at the money. shakes his head gently.}
<C>__{hamidou}
<D>__{no do! no do!}
<A>__{reaches for and: another angle hamidou takes the money from billy like candy from a baby, then takes him by the ear and slowly lifts him up. billy is like a vegetable in his hands.}
<C>__{hamidou}
<P>__{(in his broken english)}
<D>__{i tell you i see 'gain...}
<P>__{(into turkish)}
<D>__{i take you down to bath and your feet be big like...breasts}
<P>__{(a gesture)}
<A>__{hamidou leads billy roughly out of the lunatic room, pulling him by the ear. hamidou still pulling billy by the ear, guides him through the guard quarters. hamidou leads him up a narrow winding flight of stairs.}
<C>__{hamido}
<D>__{first you make mistake with ziat, now you make mistake with money. you're not a new prisoner, vilyum hi yes.}
<A>__{the tone of his voice indicates a severe reckoning this time. hamidou pulls billy by the ear into a large echoing bath. billy looking, bent over by the ear a hint of awareness of new surroundings. another angle the bath is deserted, spooky with greenish yellow fish light flittering down from holes in ceiling around damp mossy arches. steam rises off a bath. benches, buckets of water. hamidou swings billy around until he is facing him. hamidou makes an elaborate gesture of putting aside his falaka stick and holstered gun; he will use his hands.}
<C>__{hamidou}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{you've been in prison too long, vilyum hi yes.}
<A>__{he takes that: stiff arm all the way back to its full arc and whacks billy up against the wall. billy bounces back off the wall. the print of hamidou's fingers is imbedded like a flaring white rainbow in the redness of his left cheek. slam a backhanded whack. billy bounces right back from the wall. steadies him.}
<C>__{hamidou}
<D>__{you go crazy here vilyum hi yes. many people go crazy here. best thing for crazy people is this...}
<A>__{the blow, in slow motion comes sailing into: billy, and we see the brief boxer's distortion of all his face as he flies upwards and back into: the bench smashing it. echo like jarring f.x. billy is held up by the pajamas, steadied. the turkish words seem far away, incomprehensible.}
<C>__{hamidou }
<D>__{vilyum hi yes. you die here, hi yes.}
<A>__{whack another blow, but: hamidou this time holds onto the pajamas using billy like a punching bag. whack a reverse blow. hamidou increasingly excited.}
<C>__{hamidou}
<D>__{babba sikijam! i fuck your mother, i fuck your sister...}
<A>__{whack another blow in slow motion}
<C>__{hamidou}
<D>__{...i fuck your father, i fuck your brother...}
<A>__{rip! a loud sound as hamidou moves with a blur of speed, and shreds billy's pajamas with his hands. billy naked, totally passive, semiconscious. hamidou suddenly shifts position and snaps billy into a strenuous wrestling hold across his knee on the steamy floor. he loosens him up by cracking his bones along his back. hamidou sweat pouring off his face, excited.}
<C>__{hamidou}
<D>__{...and i fuck your grandmother and i fuck your pretty girlfriend...}
<P>__{and i fuck you hi yes!)}
<A>__{a bizarre otherworldly scene. this man is dredging billy through a sadistic imagination sparked by the steam, the sweat, and an ethnic identification with a turkish steam bath as a bedroom. he loosens his hold abruptly, rises, moves off as: billy holds himself on his knees, head sunk on his chest, gasping for breath, about to vomit. pause; he looks up horrified at: hamidou pouring fresh buckets of water on the floor. ssssssssss! the awakened steam coils like a snake into every cranny of the little room. blurred visuals hamidou stripping his shirt off. a huge muscular flash of chest, a belt being snapped open. billy waiting. a figure moving through the steam, closer. billy backing away from it. steam a glint of a face coming through. hamidou his eyes so intense they seem to burn off the steam like sun cutting haze. then disappear again. billy pulls back. a pause. silence. cat and mouse. then very suddenly: a hand reaches out of the steam and grabs billy by the hair. a grunt, off. billy his eyes moving fast. a flash of a huge darkened penis, fully erect cutting forward into the steam like a from drill, detached from the rest of the body. a sound grotesque and so sudden after the silence it jars the senses. a blurred visual then: billy launching forward in slow motion, desperation distorting his features and: steam then billy's head slams through it in slow motion and: smashes the penis with its skull. a horrifying gasp. blurred visuals steam hamidou staggering close surprise, pain...}
<B>__{billy moving.}
<A>__{a foot coming up fast through the steam, connecting again with the genitals. another scream. a body hitting the tiles. billy groping for the falaka stick. raises it. a struggle two bodies thrashing, one of them screaming now in pain. a definitive sound then a thwack! another thwack! the steam seems to clear and billy is on top of the gigantic hamidou smashing him with the falaka stick with all his might. hamidou is in contortions, his nose busted and bleeding. his hand gripping billy by the neck, forcing him back and strangling him at the same time. billy is red in the face, such is the force of this creature but continues to beat him, harder, harder. his expression filled with a life energy, seeded in hatred, that he thought he had lost. again, again }
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{babba sikijam, hamidu! i fuck your mother, i fuck your daughter, i fuck your sons, i fuck your wife!}
<A>__{the band slips from his throat, then springs up desperately again and clenches billy's whole face with one gigantic palm, clawing to get in, then just as quickly slips away. billy beats on again, again. blood flows fast in agitated swirls into the little pool.}
