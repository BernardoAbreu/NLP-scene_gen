<L>__{interior maze car logan and francis}
<A>__{the door slides shut. they sink into seat forms which yield to them. they move off.}
<L>__{exterior maze car}
<A>__{moving through the city at terrific speed. giving us glimpses of the city as it goes. slowing finally as we see: the city featuring arcade brightly lit, garish. we get only a glimpse as the maze car disappears into a tunnel. maze car station arcade as the maze car stops, opens and logan and francis exit into a gathering crowd. full shot arcade glittering, crowded. throngs of people moving on many levels, some walking, some on moving platforms. it's the great white way, luna park you name it. gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every delight too much to take in at a glance.}
<B>__{with logan and francis}
<A>__{as they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good natured argument continuing...}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{but you don't know, you just say what everyone says. one for one. one for one."}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{well, why no!? that's exactly how everything works. how else could the city stay in balance you have a better idea?}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{no, but at least i wonder sometimes instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. you sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know, logan you wonder a lot. too much for a sandman}
<A>__{they are passing the facade of a relive shop the signs urging people to: relive your most precious memories. do it again and again! refresh and renew anytime!! as they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly, falling into step just ahead of logan and francis. then one of the men stops abruptly, almost colliding with them. he mumbles an apology and starts back to relive. as he disappears into the relive shop, his friend shrugs cheerfully to logan and francis and moves on. arcade another angle new you they are moving past a shop called new you #483 when a man comes cannonading out, thrilled and excited. he rushes over to a pretty young woman who has been eying logan and francis, plants himself in front of her with his hands framing his face.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{well? how do you like it?}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(critically)}
<D>__{i don't know. the cheeks maybe... look a little }
<C>__{man}
<D>__{cheeks? cheeks? right. too much, you think?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{too little.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{too little?}
<P>__{(gestures)}
<D>__{too little. okay, wait for me.}
<A>__{and he darts back into new you #483. the woman shrugs, glances around, smiles and goes off with a passer by. arcade another angle love shop signs promising love, fulfillment, rare delights. people streaming in and out. a woman comes out looking glazed, breathing "yes...yes..." as she passes camera logan and francis emerge from the crowd and camera moves with them.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{did you ever see francis 8?}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{i never even visited nursery before tonight.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when you wonder, it slows you up you know?}
<A>__{they are now passing the facade of hallucimill where the signs promise: lift off, crazy lift, super lift...here the people going in are simply excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned out of their minds...}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{i don't know what makes you so curious. you have any idea who his seed mother was?}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{of course not! i m curious, not sick.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<A>__{the crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway. logan and francis are swallowed up in the group. full shot arcade great hall an immense room into which the streams of people coming from the entertainment area are mingling. there is a general air of anticipation stirring the crowd as camera singles out logan and francis entering, waving to friends. camera closes in on them just as they reach a beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see francis. they embrace, and as they break:}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{and that's my friend, logan.}
<P>__{(as she acknowledges the introduction)}
<D>__{we're celebrating his next in line. carousel arcade who knows? want to come along?}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(smiles, shakes her head)}
<D>__{only if i make it to the top of carousel.}
<P>__{(she holds up her hand)}
<D>__{thirty and the big spin.}
<A>__{in her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. francis nods, gives her a half squeeze.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{you're thirty already? i always thought i was older than you }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, give it a good try.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{you know i always have.}
<A>__{another beautiful woman joins them.}
<D>__{2nd woman}
<P>__{(to the first)}
<D>__{sorry i won't be at carousel tonight. it1s my love shop turn.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{that's all right. happy turn. 2nd woman you'll renew. i've got a feeling.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{so do i...but if i don't at least i will have the ultimate thrill. i'd almost rather have that than renew. 2nd woman i feel the same way. sometimes i think i'm not even going to try and renew when my time comes. but that's three years away. so long.}
<A>__{the 2nd woman walks away.}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(after a beat; to first woman)}
<D>__{it's been nice.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{um huh.}
<A>__{they look briefly and then she turns away. francis takes logan's arm and they move off.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{i guess you never had her?}
<A>__{logan shakes his head.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{you missed something special.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{well...you can't have them all.}
<C>__{logan and francis}
<P>__{(together, it's an old joke)}
<D>__{but you can try.}
<A>__{they laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters, moving with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them, almost knocking francis over. he reels, logan catches him and they recover in time to see the trio rip wildly through the crowd, knocking people down, screaming with shrill joy as they disappear.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{the damned yellows are getting out of hand. those three ought to be in cathedral. no business scrambling in arcade...}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(laughs cuffs francis' arm)}
<D>__{what an old, old man you're getting to be, francis. weren't you ever a yellow? i bet you were even wilder than }
<P>__{(he breaks off as the lights in the great hall dim)}
<D>__{ come on, sandman.}
<A>__{the two of them start to move to the far end of the great hall. full shot great hall as everyone begins to move to the far end, where great curtains have parted to reveal arcade great hall carousel entrance ac the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystal design ornaments an entrance the crystal is red and pulsing rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling tone. as we move toward it with logan and francis, the tone deepens, the great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality...}
<B>__{with logan and francis}
<A>__{in the crowd they overtake a fellow sandman, daniel, and fall in step with him. when they speak now, their voices are hushed.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{you should have been with us in nursery, daniel. i'm positive i recognized him }
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(hustling logan)}
<D>__{come on. i don't want to miss the filing in. there'll be some i know tonight, i think...}
<C>__{daniel}
<P>__{(glances at his own red crystal, nods)}
<D>__{yes. me, too. you know we're both on monitor tonight.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{damn! that's right. just when i feel like an all out blast in arcade .}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{want me to take your shift? i'm feeling restless anyway}
<A>__{francis glances at him, exchanges a look with daniel. they vanish into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and we see full shot carousel framed in a huge corridor we see a steep sided arena dropping down to a shadowy center, which even now pulsates and flickers in changing dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel flower shape. there is one entrance into the center a kind of ramp from below the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation builds people sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting...}
