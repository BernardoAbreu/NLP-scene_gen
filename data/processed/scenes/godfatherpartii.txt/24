<B>__{med. close view}
<A>__{on one of these men, frankie pentangeli, approaching his sixties, with gray hair (the little of it left). he's a bit scruffy, this morning's shave of his white beard is not perfect, and he seems tired. he is accompanied by an associate bodyguard, willy cicci; thin and dark, and also dressed up for the occasion. frankie tries to get the attention of one of the waiters; a college groomed young man in white sports jacket and black bow tie.}
