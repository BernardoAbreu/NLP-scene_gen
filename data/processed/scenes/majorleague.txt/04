<L>__{interior men's club day}
<A>__{a 45 year old business executive is talking to a fellow club member over lunch.}
<C>__{business executive}
<D>__{they don't look particularly good, do they?}
<L>__{exterior cleveland docks day}
<A>__{two longshoremen are talking while they unload a freighter.}
<C>__{longshoremen}
<D>__{i will tell ya. they don't look very fuckin' good.}
<L>__{exterior cleveland municipal stadium day}
<A>__{down on the field, two korean groundskeepers speak korean as they resod the outfield.}
<C>__{groundskeeper}
<P>__{(in subtitles)}
<D>__{they're shitty.}
<A>__{we tilt up from the field to a glass enclosed area on the third deck.}
<L>__{interior glass enclosed area day}
<A>__{it's the cleveland indians' conference room. three men are seated around the table; charlie donovan. the manager, phil butler, public relations head, jerry simmons, operations director and lyle matthews director of player personnel donovan taps his pencil impatiently, obviously waiting for somebody.}
<C>__{donovan}
<P>__{(checking his watch)}
<D>__{thirty minutes late. think she'll show?}
<C>__{matthews}
<D>__{she's got to. she's the damn owner now.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{she didn't last week. she was having a guava facial.}
<A>__{as butler tries to figure out what a guava facial is, the conference room doors swing open and a muscular male secretary bodyguard enters, clearing the way for mrs. rachel phelps, a flashy, striking woman in her early forties. despite the designer clothes she favors, there is the hint of something less refined about her. she carries a pekinese dog, cha cha on her left hip.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{good morning, gentlemen. welcome to another season of indians' baseball.}
<A>__{the men applaud, but their hearts are barely in it. the secretary bodyguard pulls out a chair at the head of the table and rachel sits.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i know that it may not seem the same without donald here this year, but i promise you by the end of the season this team will have made history.}
<A>__{several eyes roll up around the room.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(picking up a newspaper)}
<D>__{unfortunately there are some in the press who feel that...}
<P>__{(reading from the page)}
<D>__{"the ex showgirl wife of donald phelps has no business being the owner of a major league baseball team."}
<A>__{rachel crumbles the paper and throws it away.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{obviously, donald didn't feel that way or he wouldn't have left the team to me. and i was more than showgirl. i was a dancer. now, i know some of you have doubts about my ability to run this franchise. god help you if i ever find out about it.}
<A>__{this causes a few nervous glances in the room.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{spring training begins in two weeks.}
<P>__{(throwing a sheet of paper on the table)}
<D>__{here's the list of people we'll be inviting to camp this year.}
<A>__{donovan, butler and simmons pour over the list.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i could sit here and tell you what a great year we're gonna have, but the facts are we lost the two best players we had to free agency. we haven't won a pennant in 30 years. we haven't even finished in the first division for 15. obviously it's time to make some changes. what do ya think?}
<C>__{simmons}
<D>__{i never heard of half these guys. and the ones i do know are way past their prime.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{most of these guys never had a prime.}
<C>__{butler}
<P>__{(pointing to the sheet)}
<D>__{this guy here is dead.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{cross him off then.}
<C>__{butler}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{let's not be hasty.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it's time to shake things up, charlie. clear the board and start over.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{well, it's not the best material i've ever had to work with, but i will do my best to see we move up a notch this year.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i know you will, charlie. that's why i'm movin' you up to general manager. congratulations.}
<A>__{rachel sticks out her hand. donovan shakes it somewhat feebly, bewildered by this whole development.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{well, that should do it for today. thank you, gentlemen. let's get to work.}
<A>__{with that, rachel gets up and breezes out of the room with her entourage, leaving donovan and the others dumbfounded.}
<C>__{matthews}
<P>__{(checking his watch)}
<D>__{one minute, 58 seconds.}
