<L>__{exterior pool morning}
<A>__{the slender white board extends majestically over the glistening blue water. pedro, an unshowered, pot bellied hispanic, about twenty three years of age and wearing cut off jean shorts, is standing at the end of the board, looking down at the water below as if expecting an invitation. corey, a late teenager covered with tattoos, with twigs for arms and legs, lies against the hard concrete while inserting the pool vacuum hose into one of the many pool skimmer drains. pedro begins to bounce on the board up, down, up, down. pedro launches forth as if the water called out to him and, but for his want of grace, the entry would be poetic. instead, pedro's dive is as clumsy as it is painful.}

<C>__{corey}
<D>__{at least i'm paid to be here.}
<A>__{pedro smiles as he paddles away from corey, starting to enjoy his morning swim. a payphone hanging on the pool house starts ringing. corey drops the vacuum and runs toward the payphone. in the background a number of enormous sand filters groan loudly.}
