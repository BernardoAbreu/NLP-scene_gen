<A>__{john and angela head toward isabel's room. a nurse appears from around the corner walking with a boy. it's barry, the boy in the courtyard. he locks on angela and when she makes eye contact he breaks away from the nurse, runs toward her with arms outstretched.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{barry!}
<A>__{he runs right into angela's arms, hugs her tight. angela is totally baffled. john is thoroughly intrigued.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{oh god...}
<A>__{she rushes in, gently tugs the boy away.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{no, barry, that's not isabel.}
<A>__{barry stares at angela. he reaches out, touches her face, confused. nurse pulls him back even further.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{i'm sorry. they were friends. he kind of had a crush on your sister.}
<A>__{angela nods, understanding. the nurse leads barry away. he doesn't take his eyes off angela the entire time. neither does john.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you were twins.}
<A>__{angela nods, steps inside. john pauses, thinking.}
