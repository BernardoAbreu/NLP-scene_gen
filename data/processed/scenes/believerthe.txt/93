<L>__{interior small lecture hall stage night}
<A>__{danny steps to the lectern. the crowd quiets. he stands silent for a long moment, then closes his eyes and chants with feeling:}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{shema yisroel adonai elohenu adonai echod.}
<A>__{general confusion. mrs. moebius and curtis exchange wary glances.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{who knows what that is?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{a jewish prayer.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{can anybody imagine why i would say a jewish prayer?}
<C>__{another voice}
<D>__{because you're a jew.}
<A>__{nervous laughter. danny laughs with them.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{that could be one reason. what's another?}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{let me put it this way...who here would like to destroy the jews?}
<P>__{(murmurs of approval)}
<D>__{who wants to grind their bones into the dust?}
<A>__{a scattering of applause, growing more sustained...}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{and who wants to see them rise again, wealthier, more successful, powerful, cultured and intelligent than ever?}
<A>__{silence. no one wants that.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{then you know what you have to do?... you have to love them.}
<A>__{puzzled mutterings: "what?... what's he talking about?..."}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{did he say love them? love the jews? it sounds strange, i know, but with these people nothing is simple. the jew says that all he wants is to be left alone to study his torah, do a little business and fornicate with his over sexed wife.... but it isn't true. he wants to be hated. he longs for our scorn. he clings to it as if it were the very core and mystery of his being. if hitler had not existed, the jews would have invented him. for without such hatred, the so called chosen people would vanish from the earth....}
<A>__{people react with confusion, uncertainty, suspicion.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{...and this reveals a terrible truth, the crux of our problem as nazis: the worse the jews are treated, the stronger they become. egyptian slavery made them a nation; the pogroms hardened them, auschwitz gave birth to the state of israel. suffering, it seems, is the very crucible of their genius. if the jews are, as one of their own has said, a people who will not take yes for an answer, then let us say yes to them. if they thrive on opposition, let us cease to oppose them. the way to annihilate them, utterly and completely, is to open our arms, take them into our homes and embrace them. only then will they vanish into assimilation, dilution...and love.}
<P>__{(a warning finger)}
<D>__{but we cannot pretend. the jew is nothing if not clever. he will see through condescension and hypocrisy. to destroy him, we will have to love him sincerely.}
<A>__{on the audience, befuddled. a hand goes up. danny nods to it. the man steps forward, and we see that it's guy danielsen of the times. danny is shaken....}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{but if the jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of by love or by any other means in fact make them more powerful than they are already?}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{yes. infinitely more. they would become as god.}
<A>__{murmurs of confusion, outrage... "god??!!!" danny notices the tallis crawling out from under his shirt, stuffs it back in.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{it is the jews' destiny to the annihilated so that they can be deified....}
<P>__{(the murmurs swell)}
<D>__{jesus understood this perfectly. and look what was accomplished there with the death of just one enlightened jew. imagine what would happen if we killed them all!!}
<P>__{(over the rising outrage)}
<D>__{so, let us say together... shema yisroel...}
<A>__{one or two voices respond, but must people shout him down. mrs. moebius is outraged. people are throwing things, shouting. the meeting degenerates into chaos.}
