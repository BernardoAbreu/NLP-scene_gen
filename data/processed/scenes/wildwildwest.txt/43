<L>__{exterior white house day}
<A>__{west and gordon, walking toward the hitching post. west is so beside himself he can barely untie his high voltage stud. he glowers at gordon who goes over to where... angle strange looking bicycle is parked on the other side of a bush. it has the customary big wheel in the front, little wheel in the back. (hidden from sight is a motor on the front tire. dual manifolds that sling under the rider's legs.) west shakes his head in disgust.}

<D>__{i call it the bi axle nitro combust...}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{save it. i've gotta train to catch.}
<A>__{west swings into the saddle. he looks at the snorting wild horse under him, then down at gordon attaching the box onto the seat of his nitro whatever.}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(snaps off a smug salute)}
<D>__{yee haaa!!}
<A>__{west spurs his horse and leaves gordon in the proverbial cloud of dust. although west's intentions are clear, for some reason, gordon's in no particular hurry. he sighs, climbs on the bike, takes out a hankie and cleans a pair of goggles. then, finally ready...}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{avant!!!}
<A>__{vrooom! an engine kicks in and gordon rockets forward. (yep, artemus has invented the first motorcycle!) fiery exhaust blasts out of the manifolds as the bike propels him down the street at about 60 mph right past...}
<B>__{angle on west and his stallion}
<A>__{who both look over in wide eyed shock. the horse rears as gordon screams by leaving them in a cloud of internal combustion.}
