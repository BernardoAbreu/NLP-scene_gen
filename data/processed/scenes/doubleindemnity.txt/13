<A>__{b 11 exterior super market (day) there is a fair amount of activity but the place is not crowded. neff comes along the sidewalk into the shot. he passes in front of the fruit and vegetable display and goes between the stalls into the market.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<P>__{(continued)}
<D>__{...but we couldn't be seen together any more and i had told her never to call me from her house and never to call me at my office. so we had picked out a big market on los feliz. she was to be there buying stuff every day about eleven o'clock, and i could run into her there. kind of accidentally on purpose.}
<A>__{b 12 interior market neff stops by the cashier's desk and buys a pack of cigarettes. as he is opening the pack he looks back casually beyond the turnstile into the rear part of the market. b 13 rows of high shelves in market the shelves are loaded with canned goods and other merchandise. customers move around selecting articles and putting them in their baskets. phyllis is seen among them, standing by the soap section. her basket is partly filled. she wears a simple house dress, no hat, and has a large envelope pocketbook under her arm. b 14 interior market neff has spotted phyllis. without haste he passes through the turnstile towards the back. b 15 the shelves phyllis is putting a can of cleaning powder into her basket. neff enters the shot and moves along the shelves towards her, very slowly, pretending to inspect the goods. a customer passes and goes on out of scene. phyllis and neff are now very close. during the ensuing low spoken dialogue, they continue to face the shelves, not looking at each other}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{not so loud.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i wanted to talk to you, walter. ever since yesterday.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{let me talk first. it's all set. the accident policy came through. i've got it in my pocket. i got his check too. i saw him down in the oil fields. he thought he was paying for the auto insurance. the check's just made out to the company. it could be for anything. but you have to send a check for the auto insurance, see. it's all right that way, because one of the cars is yours.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{but listen, walter }
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{quick, open your bag.}
<A>__{she hesitates, then opens it. neff looks around quickly, slips the policy out of his pocket and drops it into her bag. she snaps the bag shut.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{can you get into his safe deposit box?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{yes. we both have keys.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{fine. but don't put the policy in there yet. i will tell you when. and listen, you never touched it or even saw it, understand?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i'm not a fool.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{okay. when is he taking the train?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{walter, that's just it. he isn't going.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{that's what i've been trying to tell you. the trip is off.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what's happened?}
<A>__{he breaks off as a short, squatty woman, pushing a child in a walker, comes into sight and approaches. she stops beside neff, who is pretending to read a label on a can. phyllis puts a few cakes of soap into her basket.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(to neff)}
<D>__{mister, could you reach me that can of coffee?}
<P>__{(she points)}
<D>__{that one up there.}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(reaching up)}
<D>__{this one?}
<A>__{she nods. neff reaches a can down from the high shelf and hands it to her.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i don't see why they always have to put what i want on the top shelf.}
<A>__{she moves away with her coffee and her child. out of the corner of his eye neff watches her go. he moves closer to phyllis again.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{go ahead. i'm listening.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{he had a fall down at the well. he broke his leg. it's in a cast.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that knocks it on the head all right.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{what do we do, walter?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{nothing. just wait.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{wait for what?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{until he can take a train. i told you it's got to be a train.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{we can't wait. i can't go on like this.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{we're not going to grab a hammer and do it quick, just to get it over with.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{there are other ways.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{only we're not going to do it other ways.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{but we can't leave it like this. what do you think would happen if he found out about this accident policy?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{plenty. but not as bad as sitting in that death house.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{don't ever talk like that, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{just don't let's start losing our heads.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{it's not our heads. it's our nerve we're losing.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{we're going to do it right. that's all i said.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{walter maybe it's my nerves. it's the waiting that gets me.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it's getting me just as bad, baby. but we've got to wait.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{maybe we have, walter. only it's so tough without you. it's like a wall between us.}
<A>__{neff looks at his watch.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{good bye baby. i'm thinking of you every minute.}
<A>__{he goes off. she stares after him.}
