<A>__{it's quieter now, the party winding down, as grady sneaks james past the departing guests and toward the stairs.}

<C>__{crabtree}
<P>__{(spying james)}
<D>__{nell, hello there.}
<A>__{crabtree steps down the stairs, hand extended. james leer's pale fingers rise as if on a string.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{james. this is my editor, terry crabtree.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{james'll know about george sanders.}
<C>__{james leer}

<D>__{mr. crabtree was saying how george sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{pills. august 25, 1972. in a costa brava hotel room.}
<A>__{the few people within earshot glance oddly at james, but crabtree's eyes glitter with intrigue.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{how comprehensive of you.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{oh, james is amazing. he knows all the movie suicides. go ahead, james. tell them who else.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{there's so many...}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{just a few then. the big ones.}
<A>__{james glances at the loose group of people around him, watching, then...}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{pier angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. charles boyer, 1978, pills again. charles butterworth, 1946, i think. in a car. supposedly it was an accident, but, you know. . .}
<P>__{(a trace of irony)}
<D>__{he was distraught. dorothy dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. albert dekker, 1968, he hung himself. he wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. alan ladd, '64, more pills, carole landis, pills again, i forget when. george reeves, superman on tv, shot himself. jean seberg pills of course, 1979. everett sioane he was good pills. margaret sullavan, pills, lupe velez, a lot of pills. gig young. he shot himself and his wife in 1978. there are more but i don't know if you would have heard of them. ross alexander? clara blandick? maggie mcnamara? gia scaia?}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{i haven't heard of half of those.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{you did them alphabetically.}
<A>__{james turns, finds crabtree's laser eyes on him. james blinks, as if he had forgotten about crabtree, then shrugs shyly, looks away.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{that's just how my brain works, i guess.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{fascinating. listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. there's a place on the hill i always get trip to take me.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{actually. ..i just want to go home.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{oh, don't be silly. no one your age just wants to go home. besides, faculty will be present. just think of it as a field trip.}
<A>__{as he exits, crabtree raises an eyebrow to grady, as if to say: "bring him." miss sloviak follows, eyeing james glacially as we cut to:}
