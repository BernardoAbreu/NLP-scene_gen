<C>__{pete}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{we have everything we need right now to be completely happy. we're going to blink and be ninety.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{so, let's just choose to be happy.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{your eyes are kind of glazing over.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{no, i'm just processing it all.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{some of these i wrote for you. so, we have to exercise every day. spend more time alone together. we have to go to the therapist every week.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{that's a little pricey.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{no stressing over tiny things.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yeah, that's good. you should do that.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{we have to get more involved in school. have more patience with the kids. and we need to work on our anger.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yeah, i think it would be good if you could take care of your anger.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{no, i said both of us.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{that's what i said. our anger.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{okay. no more smoking.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yeah, you've got to cut that out.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i don't want to make this about a fight, i want to just be positive.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{okay, and then no more holding on to resentments. we have to just let that go.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{so, you're saying that if we're arguing and i apologize, you'll let it go and not throw it back in my face later?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{well, i don't do that, but i will continue not to do that. what did you write?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{all of that. that's plenty. that's a lot.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{and you're going to eat better?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{oh, yeah. i've been doing a decent job, but i don't think there's anything wrong with having some fries every now and again.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{and then i will smoke that day.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{that's not the same thing.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{it is the same thing.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i like fries.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{and the other thing is your dad stuff.}
<A>__{pete picks up a guitar and starts playing with it.}
<C>__{debbie }
<D>__{the not letting him guilt trip you all the time, because that puts a lot of pressure on you, and the whole family feels it. he's a grown man, and he's not our responsibility. and you're not giving him money anymore, right?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{no, i haven't been giving him money for years, i told you.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{can you please put that down?}
