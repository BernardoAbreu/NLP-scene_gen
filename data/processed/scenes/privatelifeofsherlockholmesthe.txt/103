<A>__{as holmes continues opening and closing the parasol, gabrielle gets out of bed, comes up beside him. holmes finishes the message, shuts the parasol, draws it back into the room. then he looks out the window. lakefront from holmes' angle dawn the monks turn away from the hotel, and with von tirpitz in the lead, move off along the shore.}

<A>__{holmes steps back from the window, faces gabrielle.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{well, it's up to the good monks now. you can consider your part of the mission accomplished, fraulein hoffmanstal.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{you're all wrong about me. my name isn't hoffmanstal.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it isn't?}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{it's von hoffmanstal.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i stand corrected.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<P>__{(glancing toward window)}
<D>__{i suppose once they're in the castle... it must amuse you, mr. holmes, trappists walking into a trap.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it's more amusing than that. once in the castle, they will encounter surprisingly little resistance it will take but a small bottle of chloroform to overcome the guards.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<P>__{(skeptically)}
<D>__{you mean you're going to let them have the air pump?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{better than that. we're going to let them have the submersible. they will find it with its engines running, all set to go. i assume they're all expert sailors? and since there is a german battleship cruising off the coast of scotland, i expect they'll try to sail it out of the lock and rendezvous at sea.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{did you say try to?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i would suggest you get your things together. mycroft will be here to take you into custody.}
<A>__{he opens her suitcase, which is on the baggage rack at the foot of the bed. gabrielle watches him for a beat, then crosses to the wardrobe, starts taking her clothes out.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{i never had you fooled for a moment, did i? you knew right from the beginning when the cabbie brought me to baker street.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{let me see not quite that soon.}
<A>__{he stretches out on the bed.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{it's so funny. i asked for this assignment, you know. i was scheduled to go to japan, but i couldn't resist the challenge of coming up against the best. i'm sorry i didn't give you a closer game.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{close enough.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{you're just being kind. i failed miserably.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{we all have occasional failures. fortunately, dr. watson never writes about mine.}
