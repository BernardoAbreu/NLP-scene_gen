<L>__{interior enterprise observation lounge day}
<A>__{data conducts a briefing for the senior officers. monitors currently show an image of romulus and remus in orbit around their sun.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{as you can see the habitable half of remus is always in darkness because, like mercury, one side always faces the sun. due to the extreme temperatures on that half of their world, the remans live on the dark side of the planet.}
<A>__{various grainy and unclear new images appear to illustrate data's words:}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{almost nothing is known about the reman homeworld, although intelligence scans have proven the existence of dilithium mining and heavy weapons construction.}
<A>__{very obscure images of remans appear, the crew can barely make out the monstrous figures:}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{the remans themselves are considered an undesirable caste in the hierarchy of the empire.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{but they also have the reputation of being formidable warriors. in the dominion war, reman forces were used as assault troops in the most violent encounters.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(grim)}
<D>__{cannon fodder.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{then how did a reman get to be praetor? i don't get it.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{we have to assume he had romulan collaborators.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{a coup d'etat?}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{the praetor's power has always been the romulan fleet. they must be behind him.}
<A>__{picard considers this.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(to data)}
<D>__{what have you learned about shinzon?}
<A>__{the images end. there are no images of shinzon.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. we can infer he is relatively young and a capable commander. he fought seventeen major engagements in the war. all successful. beyond that, we know nothing.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. keep at it. anything you can give me would be appreciated. dismissed.}
<A>__{the meeting breaks up.}
