<A>__{a beautiful garden on the edge of the library. the autumn wind is blowing. the leaves are at the height of foliage. jody and her mom are seated on a carved stone bench.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{years ago, something horrible happened in this town. when i was still in high school. a girl named elizabeth sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{attacked how?}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{she was raped. at least that's what she claimed.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{you didn't believe her?}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(confessing)}
<D>__{no, i believed her. she was in pretty bad shape. inside and out. but the boys were never formally charged.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{they were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. and she was a loner. an angry girl that no one really liked. she'd called them 'queers'.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{people thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{they were proving to her they weren't. they were very drunk. things were different back then. you think kids are sexually bottled up today....}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{and the police did nothing?}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{everyone just kind of looked the other way.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{how could you?}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{i don't know. we just did. i guess i was kind of scared going against the gain. against the whole town.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{the word is mob.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{i've regretted it ever since. never run with the herd just because they're the herd.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{who were they?}
<A>__{marge freezes. she didn't want to be asked that.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{the men. do any of them still live around here?}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{two men left town right after it happened.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{you're not telling me something.}
<A>__{marge takes a deep breath, unsure what to say.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{mr. sisler was one of them.}
<C>__{jody}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{the principal?}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{who was the fourth?}
<A>__{marge is stricken. she looks down.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{god. it's like everything that was ever repressed in this town is suddenly bubbling up through the ground.}
<A>__{jody gets it.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{her mother can't deny it any longer.}
<C>__{jody}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{that's why he called mr. sisler first. he was one of them.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. we both have...}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{jody gets up.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{he dedicated his life to law enforcement after...}
<A>__{jody runs off, very upset.}
