<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{nick's eyes roll back as he relieves himself against a tree. he shakes off the last of it and zips up.}
<L>__{exterior bluff over clear lake later}
<A>__{he emerges from the woods only to find sheeni reading his journal. she looks up at his and smiles. the brazen sneak isn't even embarrassed.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that's my journal!}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{don't get so upset nick. though your handwriting is egregious, you have a fairly decent vocabulary. although, trent is not an "affected twit."}
<A>__{nick snatches the journal out of her hands.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{those are my private thoughts and are none of your business!}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{nick?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{the lengths you say you are willing to go to to win my heart, the contemplation of suicide at the thought of not having me...}
<P>__{(taking a sensual breath)}
<D>__{it all evokes a strong emotional warmth in my breast.}
<A>__{nick can only stare at her sprawled out on her back as if posing for a centerfold.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{did you mean it, nickie?}
<A>__{a beat as he is lost in the ocean of her gaze before he manages to gain his senses.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how would you like it if i read your journal?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{you can read it if you'd like.}
<A>__{she hands it over. nick squints at the writing.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's in french.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{a necessity for a child in a household with prying christian parents.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what does it say?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{wouldn't you like to know. that last passage would be of particular interest to you.}
<A>__{nick leaps on top of her, grabbing her thin wrists. she squeals and giggles.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{spill it! i demand full disclosure!}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{never!}
<A>__{they wrestle, perspiring, squirming bodies brushing together. flashing super: thundering erection they pause. he's got her arms pinned. she's on her back. he hovers above her.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<P>__{(softly chanting)}
<D>__{nickie's got a hard on.}
<A>__{nick considers her expression.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{you're still a virgin, i can tell. maybe that's why i like you.}
<A>__{a beat. she looks at him expectantly. nick is at a loss.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{kiss me, you wienie.}
<A>__{nick tentatively approaches her luscious mouth. their noses dodge successfully and their lips meet. after a long moment, they break it off. staring into each other's eyes. sheeni jumps up.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{okay, lover. break's over. let's go!}
<A>__{nick lays in the grass a moment, watching after her.}
