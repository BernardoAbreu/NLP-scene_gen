<A>__{ronald leads tim into the room, a junior suite with two beds, a kitchenette and a couch in the separate living room area.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{check out these digs. huzzah!}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{yeah, you could do a lot worse.}
<P>__{(a serious beat)}
<D>__{look tim, i gotta put the cards on the table here. the reason we got the junior suite upgrade is because the hotel overbooked wedding or some such. point being, they were asking folks to take on a third roommate to consolidate space. now to me, being an independent owner, the savings of adding a third guy sounded like a real positive.}

<D>__{but if you've got any qualms, i hear you l & c, that's loud & clear.}
<A>__{ronald has undoubtedly been called a nerd more than once. to tim, however, he is the embodiment of cool and hilarity.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{no. i'm down. down with that. heck yeah. any idea who we're gonna be chilling with, roommate wise?}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{no. just hope he doesn't snore.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(laughs boisterously)}
<D>__{can you imagine? or someone who has terrible gas?! like, pull my finger. brrump! hello, no thanks!}
<A>__{tim is giddy like a kid away at camp for the first time.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{this isn't woodstock, tim. it's a regional insurance convention. whoever it is, i'm sure he'll be a straight shooter.}
