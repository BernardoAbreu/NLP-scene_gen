<L>__{interior dolores's house day}
<A>__{dolores and mitchell are in the modest livingroom of dolores's house. the conversation continues from the previous voice over. in the corner of the room sits abbott, dolores's husband. abbott has suffered a massive stroke, and seems to be completely paralyzed. his presence, however, is intense and powerful. mitchell frequently looks over to abbott during his conversations with dolores. abbott is always watching him like a hawk, making mitchell uneasy.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{dolores. no one calls me 'mrs. driscoll'.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{what do you mean by that, dolores?}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{about the ottos?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{yes. what do you mean by 'hippies'?}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{i mean, the way they look. their hair and clothing...}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{do they have any reputation for drugs?}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{no, nothing like that. the ottos are what i'd call model citizens. they're regular at town meetings. they give their opinions in a respectful way. they always help out at various fund raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{and they loved bear.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{oh yes. like i said, they always came out together to see him off to school. it's like he was their little treasure. he was such a beautiful boy. that's a picture of him on the wall there, behind abbott.}
<A>__{mitchell turns around to find the picture of bear. it is right behind abbott's head, so mitchell has to divide his attention between the cute photograph of bear clutching a prize rabbit at last year's county fair, and abbott's glaring eyes.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{the photographs of various children with their pets. some have ribbons.}
<C>__{dolores }
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{those are all from the fair last year. abbott and me were judges at the pet show.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{for rabbits?}
<C>__{dolores}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{abbott used to breed them 'til he had the stroke. bear won first prize. just look at the smile on his face.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{he was one of those children that bring out the best in people. he would have been a wonderful man.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{mitchell as he stares at the photo of bear.}
