<L>__{interior library day}
<A>__{paul is sleeping slumped over a table, his head cradled on crossed arms. the celestine prophecy is open face down next to him.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{sometimes you can search everywhere for answers. then one day destiny just taps you on the shoulder. i know, because it happened to me.}
<A>__{a finger reaches down and taps paul's shoulder. paul comes to and looks it's mr. mcallister.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{paul, could i talk to you for a minute?}
<A>__{millard hallway day his arm on paul's shoulder, jim walks paul down a deserted hall and into jim's classroom. jim picks up some scrap paper off the floor and puts it in the proper place.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{mr. mcallister changed my life. and no matter what they say he did or did not do, i believe he is a good man.}
<A>__{jim's classroom day paul sits in a chair, while jim stands}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{paul, i know you've been pretty down since your accident.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i wanted to play next year so bad i could taste it. and maybe go on to...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i know. i understand disappointment. i really do.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{but you've got a big choice right now. you can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity. i personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and i don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{let me give you a clue. you're a born leader. you're one of the most popular students at millard. you're honest and straightforward. you don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against westside. the other kids look up to you. what does that spell?}
<A>__{paul furrows his brow and looks around, searching for an answer. his lower lip is wet.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{student... council... president.}
<A>__{it takes a moment for this to sink in. finally}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{who, me? nooo. i never... i don't know anything about that stuff, mr. m. besides, that's tracy flick's thing. she's always working so hard and }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{yeah, no, she's a go getter, all right.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{and she's super nice}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{yeah. but one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? that's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{paul, what's your favorite fruit?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{huh? oh. uh... pears}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{okay, let's say}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, wait apples. apples.}
<A>__{jim draws illustrative circles on the board as he speaks.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{fine. let's say all you ever knew was apples. apples, apples and more apples. you might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. then one day there's an orange. and now you can make a decision. do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? that's democracy.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i also like bananas.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{exactly. so what do you say? maybe it's time to give a little something back.}
