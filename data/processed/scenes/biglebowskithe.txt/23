<T>__{on a deafening crash we cut to:}
<A>__{the dude's car we are looking into the car through the broken windshield as it rattles down the freeway. wind whistles through the caved in windows. the dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the road. walter, beside him, and donny in the back seat, munch 'on in and out burgers. creedence music plays above the bluster of wind. dude's bungalow as the dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two by four into the floor just inside, and parallel to, the front door.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i accept your apology. . . no i, i just want to handle it myself from now on. . . no. that has nothing to do with it. . . .yes, it made it home, i'm calling from home. no, walter, it didn't look like larry was about to crack.}
<A>__{he finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair that stands nearby.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{well that's your perception. . . well you're right, walter, and the unspoken message is fuck you and leave me the fuck alone. . . yeah, i will be at practice.}
<A>__{he hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into place with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced against the two by four, thus wedging the door closed, when the door is opened outwards. the chair clatters to the floor.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{woo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in, kicking the chair away.}
<C>__{woo}
<D>__{pin your diapers on, lebowski. jackie treehorn wants to see you.}
<C>__{blond man}
<D>__{and we know which lebowski you are, lebowski.}
<C>__{woo}
<D>__{yeah. jackie treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat lebowski.}
<C>__{blond man}
<D>__{you're not dealing with morons here.}
<B>__{blackness}
<A>__{out of the blackness something is falling toward us. it is a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy. she is topless. she falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a beat reappears, rising into the night sky.}
<B>__{malibu beach}
<A>__{a crowd of mostly tanned middle aged men with blow dried hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual attire, are blanket tossing the squealing young woman in nightmarish slow motion.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{it is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing kerosene heaters. 1960's mainstream jazz, of the mancini brubeck school, has been piped down to speakers on the beach'. in long shot now the woman rises, squealing, disappears into darkness, descends into light, rises again. a man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach light. he is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants and a turnbull & asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the neck. behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and disappears.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hello dude, thanks for coming. i'm jackie treehorn.}
<B>__{inside the beach house}
<A>__{the dude is looking around at the '60's modern decor.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{this is quite a pad you got here, man. completely unspoiled.}
<C>__{treehorn}
<D>__{what's your drink, dude?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{white russian, thanks. how's the smut business, jackie?}
<C>__{treehorn}
<D>__{i wouldn't know, dude. i deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and }
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{which one was logjammin'?}
<C>__{treehorn}
<D>__{regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. it's video, dude. now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.}
<A>__{he taps his forehead with one finger.}
<C>__{treehorn}
<D>__{people forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone }
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{on you, maybe.}
<A>__{he hands him the drink.}
<C>__{treehorn}
<D>__{of course, you do get the good with the bad. the new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software. wave of the future, dude. 100% electronic.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{uh huh. well, i still jerk off manually.}
<C>__{treehorn}
<D>__{of course you do. i can see you're anxious for me to get to the pointerior well dude, here it is. where's bunny?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i thought you might know, man.}
<C>__{treehorn}
<D>__{me? how would i know? the only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{but she hasn't run off, she's been }
<A>__{treehorn waves this off.}
<C>__{treehorn}
<D>__{i've heard the kidnapping story, so save it. i know you're mixed up in all this, dude, and i don't care what you're trying to take off her husband. that's your business. all i'm saying is, i want mine.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties. if i can find your money, man what's in it for the dude?}
<C>__{treehorn}
<D>__{of course, there's that to discuss. refill?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{does the pope shit in the woods?}
<C>__{treehorn}
<D>__{let's say a 10% finder's fee?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{okay, jackie, done. i like the way you do business. your money is being held by a kid named larry sellers. he lives in north hollywood, on radford, near the in and out burger. a real fuckin' brat, but i'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies. so if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.}
<A>__{he is getting to his feet, but sways woozily.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i will go out and mingle. jesus, you mix a hell of a caucasian, jackie.}
<A>__{the dude shakes his head, tries to focus.}
<C>__{treehorn}
<D>__{a fifteen year old? is this your idea of a joke?}
<A>__{jackie treehorn's image starts to swim. he is joined on either side by woo and the blond man, all three men looking grimly down at the dude.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{no funny stuff, jackie. . . the kid's got it. hiya, fellas. . . kid just wanted a car. all the dude ever wanted. . . was his rug back. . . not greedy. . . it really.}
<A>__{he squints at jackie treehorn, who swims in and out of focus. tied the room together. he tips forward, spilling his drink off the table.}
<B>__{from under the glass coffee table}
<A>__{looking up at the dude as his face hits the glass and squishes.}
