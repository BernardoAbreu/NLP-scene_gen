<L>__{interior stairwell margot's guest room day}
<A>__{pauline and margot carry bags up the stairs. margot now wears a knit red bracelet. they're tentative with one another.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{is malcolm what you thought he'd be?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{well, i didn't know what to }
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{the moustache is temporary. he left it for last when he was shaving. it's meant to be funny.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{he told me.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{they enter the guest room. the windows are wide open, the curtains blowing, but the room is very neatly made up.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i'm sorry with so little time to prepare, we had to put you in malcolm's storage room }
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{this was becky's room. poor becky.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{yeah, poor becky. now it's a storage room. i've just started to feel like it's our house not my parents. you know?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{our parents.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{of course. it might still smell like paint, but...}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i thought he was a musician.}
<A>__{pauline jimmies down the stiff windows. margot begins to unpack and hang up clothes in the closet.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{well, music's officially a hobby... he's painting now. and writing letters to newspapers and magazines. he's very meticulous, he'll spend up to a week writing a response to a music review. he's incredibly smart. maybe too smart. i don't know. we're doing very well.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{good. i mean, you must be.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i don't know where to begin. what can i tell you? it seems i'm pregnant, but it's really early so... i haven't told anyone. i mean, i haven't told malcolm or ingrid.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{wow...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{yeah, if it sticks. we'll see. i hope so. things are good. we did a couples seminar two months ago or so in maine. they give you exercises and things to do. i know you're not convinced, but...}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(vaguely)}
<D>__{mm hm.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{we got engaged right afterwards. the guy who runs it, strickland, wrote a really interesting book about loving which i will lend you if you want.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(non committal)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{but only if you'll read it. because i need it back. i made notes in the margins.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i may not get to it for a while.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{well, i'm not going to lend it to you if you're not going to read it.}
<A>__{they meet eyes. pauline quickly turns away.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{it's going to be very informal by the way. just mom and becky. malcolm's brother. few friends. and now you and claude. nothing like the first one.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(wary)}
<D>__{becky's coming? pauline margot she isn't how you... i'd really like...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you go.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i was going to say, "i'd really like some white wine."}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{oh. yeah. we have a... well...i'm glad you changed your mind and came. i never heard from you after i sent the invite...i even wondered if you got it.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{well, i'm so pleased we're here.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{did you get it?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{pauline waits for an explanation.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i'm sorry you were so angry...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i wasn't angry. i was...disappointed.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{uh huh. but you see when you say, "disappointed" it puts me in a crummy situation. like i let you down.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{but you did in a way.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i don't see it like that.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{fine. i felt betrayed. is that word okay?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{again, you're making me the aggressor.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you were the aggressor.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{let's not... i've become a really good cook.}
