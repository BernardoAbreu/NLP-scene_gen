<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{leopold unfolds his napkin and puts it on his lap. he begins to eat his dinner. slowly. elegantly. alone.}
<L>__{interior sports bar night}
<A>__{kate places the napkin on her lap. she stares at it a long while. finally she looks up at larry.}
<L>__{extreme close up of larry}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i'm telling you the guy was a dick! a total asshole!}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(jarred awake)}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{jeff murray. the guy i've been talking about. hello?}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(realizing her feelings}
<D>__{for leopold, smiling}
<P>__{radiantly at larry)}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{then as she leaves, a parting shot.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{don't get up.}
<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{sound of keys in the lock, then kate bursts through the door.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{leopold?}
<A>__{the living room is dark and empty. she goes through the living room, past the hallway, into the bedroom.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{leopold?}
<A>__{his bedroom is empty. he is not there.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{oh, leopold...}
<A>__{she runs into charlie's studio and stops short. next to charlie's stern paintings, leopold's portrait of kate shines in the moonlight. she wears an antique dress. she is lovely. kate sees herself as leopold sees her and is touched. she turns and collides head on with leopold.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{oh!}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{bread and butter.}
<A>__{he is wearing gloves and an apron. he rubs his bruised head, inadvertently leaving a trail of suds along his face.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you're back early. did you enjoy your date?}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(happily)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she moves in close, trying to remove the soap from his face.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{here, you've got some...}
<A>__{he wipes his face making it much worse.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{is it gone?}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she uses the apron to wipe away the soap. they gaze at each other and become serious.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{a funny thing happened to me on my bland date this evening, leopold. i really can't explain it. this puffed up, puritanical, blundering, greenhorn kept popping into my mind all night long at the most inopportune times. i couldn't get rid of him.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{how inconsiderate.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{yeah, it was. the harder i tried, the more persistent he became. he's conceited and inflated and unseasoned and it doesn't seem to matter... he's 134 years old but i can't get him out of my head.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{is he there right now?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{right here. larger than life.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i will protect you...}
<A>__{they kiss. a long romantic passionate kiss.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{dr. coles, would you grant me license to dine with you tomorrow evening at eight o'clock?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{permission granted.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{until tomorrow, then.}
<A>__{they separate. a beat. leopold gestures for kate to go first. they head down the hallway together into their separate rooms.}
