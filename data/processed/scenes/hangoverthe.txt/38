<A>__{sitting in an east vegas strip mall, sandwiched between a laundromat and a pawn shop, is the pink now & forever wedding chapel. the cadillac parks in the lot out front.}
<L>__{interior now & forever wedding chapel day}
<A>__{everything in the small, tacky wedding chapel is white plastic. white plastic plants, white plastic cross, white plastic chairs. the guys enter.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{what if they don't remember us ?}
<C>__{voice behind them}
<D>__{aaaayyyyy!}
<A>__{the guys turn to find the hirsute owner of the chapel, steve gianopolus, 40's, in a tight white suit, his arms spread wide. steve is all vegas, by way of long island.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{how are you, you dumb bastards?!}
<A>__{he warmly hugs the guys. they have zero memory of him, and it shows as they hug back weakly, unfamiliar...}
<C>__{steve }
<D>__{carla, get your fat ass out here! alan and the boys are here!}
<P>__{(to the guys)}
<D>__{you here to pick up your wedding photos?!}
<A>__{alan starts to decline, when }
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{does the pope wear a funny hat?! let's do this thing!}
<A>__{steve cackles and guides them over to a table; alan scowls.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{and where is chastity today?}
<A>__{they all sit on white plastic chairs.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{w who's...chastity?}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{your wife, man ! aww, you're just breaking my balls!}
<A>__{alan looks ill. laughing, steve retrieves a folder and starts laying out a series of wedding photos on the table. vick eagerly peruses them, enjoying this.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{uh, it was such a lovely ceremony, wasn't it?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{hand to god, i've never seen two people more in love!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{sadly, i believe you...}
<A>__{the guys look at the photos of alan's wedding from the night before. they're typical wedding shots, only the guys are all wearing medieval costumes, swords, bows, tights, even armor. they look incredibly happy and incredibly drunk. the next photo is of alan and his busty blonde bride. she's having a blast in a white medieval gown and tiara.}
<C>__{vick }
<D>__{hello, chastity...}
<A>__{alan just closes his eyes, oh god.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i am never...ever...drinking again.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{jesus, she is stacked.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{stu, please, show some class. that's alan's wife you're talking about.}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(to alan, guilty)}
<D>__{sorry. she looks really nice.}
<A>__{but alan is too busy gaping at the next photo, of him and chastity atop a unicorn in the chapel. (it is, of course, a rented pony with a lame horn strapped to its head.)}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{we got a unicorn?!}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{oh, yeah, you got the entire double camelot package.}
<A>__{alan just rubs his temples, oh no.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{a and how much did that cost?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{7 thousand dollars.}
<A>__{alan closes his eyes. stu and vick exchange a look, no way!}
<C>__{steve }
<D>__{yeah, you didn't want to get it, either, but vick insisted.}
<A>__{beat. then alan pounces across the table at vick!}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i'm gonna kill you!}
<C>__{vick}
<P>__{(fending him off)}
<D>__{you can't put a pricetag on love, alan! ow! you just can't!}
<A>__{stu hops up and starts pulling alan off of vick.}
<C>__{voice behind them}
<D>__{stop fighting immediately!}
<A>__{the guys straighten like schoolboys as steve's wife carla,}
