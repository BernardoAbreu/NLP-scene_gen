<A>__{schindler barges into stern's office. in a foul and aggressive mood, he dispenses with pleasantries in order to admonish the accountant }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{people die, it's a fact of life.}
<A>__{stern has hardly had time to look up from the work on his desk.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{he wants to kill everybody? great. what am i supposed to do, bring everybody over? is that what you think? yeah, send them over to schindler, send them all. his place is a "haven," didn't you know? it's not a factory, it's not an enterprise of any kind, it's a haven for people with no skills whatsoever.}
<A>__{stern's look is all innocence, but schindler knows better.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you think i don't know what you're doing? you're so quiet all the time? i know.}
<C>__{stern}
<P>__{(with concern)}
<D>__{are you losing money?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{no, i'm not losing money, that's not the pointerior}

<D>__{what other point is }
<C>__{schindler}
<P>__{(interrupts; yells)}
<D>__{it's dangerous. it's dangerous, to me, personally.}
<A>__{silence. schindler tries to settle down. then }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you have to understand, goeth's under enormous pressure. you have to think of it in his situation. he's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people he's got a lot of things to worry about. and he's got the war. which brings out the worst in people. never the good, always the bad. always the bad. but in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this. he'd be all right. there'd be just the good aspects of him. which is a wonderful crook. a guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...}

<D>__{and killing.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i will admit it's a weakness. i don't think he enjoys it.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{all right, he does enjoy it, so what? what do you expect me to do about it?}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{there's nothing you can do. i'm not asking you to do anything. you came into my office.}
<A>__{but it isn't stern who needs convincing; it's schindler himself. it's doubtful he even realizes this, but it's clear to stern. schindler sighs either at the predicament itself, or at the fact that he's allowed stern to place him right in the middle of it. he turns to leave, hesitates. he conducts a mental search for a name and eventually comes up with it:}

<D>__{perlman, husband and wife.}
<A>__{he unstraps his watch, hands it to stern.}
<C>__{schindler}
