<L>__{exterior gage, at the edge of the road}
<A>__{a truck is coming. a great big one.}
<L>__{exterior angle on the truck, cu}
<A>__{the grille looks like a tombstone that's learned how to snarl.}
<L>__{exterior gage}
<A>__{he takes a step into the road...and then big, gnarled hands grab him. gage looks rather surprised at this, but not worried this kid is used to being picked up and treated humanely. to gage strangers are as interesting as...well, as interesting as orinco trucks.}
<L>__{exterior gage and jud crandall}
<A>__{the fellow who has picked gage up is a man of about eighty in old blue jeans, a faded bruce springsteen t shirt. over this he wears a faded khaki vest with bright silver buttons. his face is deeply wrinkled and kindly.}
<C>__{jud crandall }
<D>__{no you don't, my friend not in that road.}
<A>__{but he softens this with a grin. gage grins back at him.}
<C>__{gage}
<D>__{drucks!}
<C>__{jud }
<D>__{no shit, sherlock.}
<A>__{jud carries him up the driveway to the station wagon. here he's joined by louis and rachel, out of breath and really scared. ellie brings up the rear. she's still sniffling.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{gage!}
<C>__{jud }
<D>__{he was headed for the road, looked like. i corralled him for you, missus.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{thank you. thank you so much.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yes thanks. i'm louis creed.}
<A>__{he sticks out his hand and jud shakes it. louis takes it easy no crushing jaycees grip, or anything like that the old guy looks as if he might have arthritis.}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{jud crandall. i live just across the road.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm rachel. thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{no harm, no foul. but you want to watch out for that road. those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.}
<A>__{he leans over toward ellie.}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{who might you be, little miss?}
<C>__{ellie}

<D>__{are clams really happy?}
<A>__{they all laugh even gage.}
<C>__{rachel}
