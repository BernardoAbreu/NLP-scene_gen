<A>__{the room is plain, like the room mrs. gold was kept in. the door opens and tracy and mills enter. they look sleepy, carrying suitcases. a uniformed cop closes the door for them. mills goes to lay a suitcase on a table while tracy looks around, depressed, distant. the lighting is bad. there are no decorations, no windows. a wide crack runs down one wall. tracy sits down on the bed. mills notices her discontent.}
