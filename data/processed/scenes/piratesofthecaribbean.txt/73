<L>__{exterior caribbean sea day}
<A>__{the interceptor, on open waters, glorious, her white sails set wing to wing.}
<L>__{exterior h.m.s. interceptor day}
<A>__{close on: jack's compass, cradled in both hands. jack leans over and studies it almost like he's praying. on the compass the face shows old fashioned rose petal style direction markers below a quivering indicator that settles on southeast.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{bear three points starboard.}
<A>__{anamaria turns the wheel, adjusting course. the ship leans into the new direction. jack looks down on the compass where the indicator spins, reverses, settles on northeast.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{six points port!}
<A>__{anamaria frowns, but follows the order, turns the wheel back, and the ship responds. will works on deck, coiling a rope but he watches jack and anamaria, clearly not happy. gibbs hobbles up.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{left handed ropes are coiled against the sun, or it's bad luck!}
<P>__{(twirls a finger)}
<D>__{anty clockwise.}
<A>__{gibbs takes over the task. the ship shifts course again. will has had enough.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{how do we expect to find an island no one can find with a compass that doesn't work?}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.}
<P>__{(voice low)}
<D>__{that compass gives bearings to the isla de muerta, wherever it may lie.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{really?}
<P>__{(moves closer)}
<D>__{so ... what's the story on the pistol?}
<A>__{gibbs settles in, happy to have a willing listener.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{i will tell lee. now, jack sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts. this was when he was captain of the black pearl }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what? he never told me that.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{ah he's learned, then. plays things more close to the vest. see, jack was a cartographer, back in old england. somehow i he came by the money to commission the pearl. hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.}
<P>__{(lowers his voice)}
<D>__{so, they're forty days out, and the first mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too. so jack gave up the bearings.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{that night, there was mutiny.}
<A>__{gibbs voice is a whisper, now, so will has to lean closer.}
<C>__{gibbs }
<D>__{jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crewmen. he was marooned on an island, left there to die.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{how did he get off the island?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{i didn't!}
<A>__{will and gibbs jump. jack is right there beside them.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{my body's still there, rotting away, and i am but a ghost!}
<A>__{will and gibbs aren't sure what to make of that. jack laughs.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{how did you get off the island?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.}
<A>__{he starts off.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{wait what about the pistol?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the pistol. when a pirate is marooned, will, he's given a pistol with a single shot. no good for hunting, or surviving, really. but after three weeks of starvation and thirst the option of that pistol begins to look good.}
<A>__{jack lets this sink in. he pulls out the pistol, raises it.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{but i survived. and i still have that single shot. it's meant for one man. my mutinous first mate }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{barbossa.}
<A>__{jack shoots a glance at will nods, and moves away.}
