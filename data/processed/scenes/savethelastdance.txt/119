<L>__{interior feetz bar night}
<A>__{patrick and malakai nurse drinks. the music fails to move them. they have too much on their minds. malakai fires up a cigarette.}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{so what you gonna do?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{how many times you gonna ask me that?}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{it's payback time. either you down or you ain't. either you m'boy or you not. simple as that.}
<A>__{patrick takes a long moment. the choice is simple. it's the decision that's complicated. he downs his drink. hedges.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{even if i did ride, you ain't got nobody but lip and lip will get a nigger's ass killed. quick.}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{eastside ain't got no firepower. i got some shit, man. ak 47. we go in, get out with one spray down.}
<A>__{just then snookie and sara walk toward them from the dance floor. something in their faces unsettles sara but snookie, oblivious, dances up to the bar, snapping his fingers and bobbing his head.}
<C>__{snookie}
<D>__{you see us, patrick?}
<C>__{malakai}
<P>__{(a storm warning)}
<D>__{you see us, man? we're rappin'.}
<A>__{snookie rebuffs him, keeps talking to patrick...}
<C>__{snookie}
<D>__{me and sara lit it up! y e o w!}
<A>__{... bumps his butt against sarah's hip, does a very ungainly half split. sara and patrick exchange smiles. malakai isn't amused. he flattens snookie's ass with the business end of his foot. snookie sprawls flat on his face to the floor. now malakai's amused. sara looks at patrick. patrick scowls at malakai.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{that shit ain't funny.}
<C>__{snookie}
<P>__{(springing up)}
<D>__{damn right it ain't funny.}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{i thought you liked it down there. that's your specialty, ain't it? crawling?}
<C>__{snookie}
<D>__{that was a reflex action, man. and you just plain rude and wrong to bring the shit up in mixed company.}
<A>__{sara's not quite sure what they're alluding to but she doesn't want the displeasure of malakai's company. she taps patrick.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i gotta get home. ready?}
<A>__{malakai's eyes slice into her. first snookie, now this bitch. steppin' all over his conversation with patrick.}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{no, he ain't ready. he's talkin'. to me. a b conversation. gotta go? c yourself the fuck home.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(a real reflex action)}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{malakai lunges for her. the move is so swift and sudden patrick overturns his stool to dive between them. he sweeps sara behind him, into the path of a startled snookie. stands there nose to nose with malakai, staring him down, furious with him.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{have you lost your motherfuckin' mind, man? huh? have you!}
<A>__{sara, frightened and frozen, doesn't know what to do. snookie's voice weakly creaks out. he's trying to rise to the occasion.}
<C>__{snookie}
<D>__{patrick, man, c'mon.}
<A>__{but malakai and patrick stay where they stand. too close for comfort. both in the danger zone. malakai regards patrick with a combination of cruel anger and deep, genuine hurt.}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{you take that bitch's back and won't even cover mine?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{'cause you wrong, malakai!}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{no! you wrong. you been wrong. you ain't worth shit no more.}
<P>__{(venomously)}
<D>__{get out my face, and take that ho with you.}
<A>__{patrick bucks up. sara walks over to him, gently clutches his sleeve. it's no easier to turn away from malakai than it is to walk away from a lifetime of friendship. but patrick does. with sara holding onto his arm, at his side, he turns and walks away.}
