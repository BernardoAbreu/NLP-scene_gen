<L>__{exterior cave day}
<A>__{lo walks out into a barren mountain landscape. a chicken roasts over a fire. lo whistles. jen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head. lo passes out as jen scurries away.}
<L>__{exterior mountainside and desert day}
<A>__{jen tries to find her way among the treacherous stony terrain, her lips chapped and fingers bloody and blistered. but soon she passes out.}
<L>__{interior cave night}
<A>__{jen again awakes inside the cave. lo tries to feed her some water, but she chokes, and tries to push him away, only to find that her legs and hands are tied up.}
<C>__{lo}
<D>__{you've got quite a temper. it's better this way.}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{you coward!}
<C>__{lo}
<D>__{still in a bad mood? at least you're speaking. what's your name?}
<A>__{jen spits at lo.}
<C>__{lo}
<D>__{i didn't think the hans had names like that.}
<A>__{later: she weaves in and out of consciousness. in the flickering lights, she sees lo sharpening his arrows. later, he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift bathroom a water filled cavity serves as a tub. he rises as jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and dishevelled body. he comes over and unties her.}
<C>__{lo}
<D>__{relax. if i had wanted to, i would already have done it. you must be dying for a bath. fresh water's hard to get here. but i managed to bring some up. you can wear my clothes when you're done. they're clean. don't worry. i will sing, so you'll know where i am. after the bath, you'll be calmer.}
<A>__{jen nods and the bandit releases her. he starts to sing as he walks out. jen waits until the sound recedes before closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit. while she bathes, she listens to his singing, a loud rendition of a tribal song. lo apparently doesn't remember all the lyrics, and la las his way through more than a few passages. jen smiles.}
