<L>__{interior mackelway's apartment bedroom resuming}
<A>__{mackelway stares out the window; seems like he just heard that scream. of course, that'd be impossible. he looks to that map. his phone rings. he eyes it, unsurprised...}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior woods outside sleeper, mo. later}
<A>__{law enforcement vehicles surround the site. cops, grieves, coroner's guys taking pictures. loretta is sitting on the back of an ambulance, being tended to. a composite artist sits beside her, trying.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{i don't think the eyes are right.}
<C>__{composite artist}
<D>__{narrower?}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{no, they were... i don't really know.}
<A>__{composite artist keeps trying, but his attempt doesn't look anything like the face of o'ryan. charlton, meanwhile, stands over the body, mind racing. a missouri highway patrol car pulls up. mackelway steps out of it. we follow him as he takes in the scene. a flashbulb illuminates starkey's chest; is got a zero with a slash through it. but mackelway hasn't seen the guy's face yet.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{sir?}
<P>__{(charlton turns)}
<D>__{we got an i.d. yet?}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{mmm hmm.}
<P>__{(mackelway waits)}
<D>__{might wanna find yourself a fender. you're gonna need to sit down.}
<P>__{(mackelway's still waiting)}
<D>__{it's virgil ray starkey.}
<A>__{mackelway pales. we stay on him for a moment as it registers. the man he caught, and then lost, has killed again. no. god, no.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<P>__{(struggling for composure:)}
<D>__{starkey did this?}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{no. starkey's the one on the ground.}
<A>__{mackelway pauses, thinks he must've heard wrong. but he turns toward the face, as another flashbulb illuminates it, searing the image into the darkness. starkey. dead. his eyelids ripped away. mackelway stares, stunned. can't fucking believe it.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{my god...}
<A>__{it's like looking at a ghost a spectre that's been haunting him, dead now... mackelway pulls out his minox, starts photographing, moving in on those lidless eyes...}
<C>__{grieves}
<D>__{gonna make a wallet size of that one?}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{give him a break, grieves.}
<A>__{mackelway doesn't comment. just keeps snapping shots...}
