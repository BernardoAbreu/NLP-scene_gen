<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior marshland dusk}
<A>__{we move across smoldering embers and reach a small grass fire. dirt is thrown over the flames before a boot finishes stamping them out. super: plainfield, wisconsin, 1944}
<C>__{henry gein }
<D>__{we're just lucky it didn't reach the trees...}
<A>__{we move up two dirty pairs of overalls to find henry and ed gein sweating away as they continue shovelling out the flames. both are in their forties and wearing flannel shirts. ed wears an elmer fudd hat.}
<C>__{henry gein }
<D>__{there's gonna be a lot more jobs at that factory by milwaukee come june. i could put in a word.}
<C>__{ed gein}
<D>__{you can't leave us, henry. she needs both of us }
<C>__{henry gein}
<D>__{can you stop being a momma's boy for one second?}
<A>__{henry looks at ed and he shrinks back.}
<C>__{henry gein }
<D>__{i'm not trying to hurt you but jesus you got to live your own life someday. that woman can take care of her own goddamn }
<A>__{clang. henry is hit by the shovel in the back of the head and goes down. ed steps slowly forward and puts down the shovel. the look on his face isn't anger. it's blank. he pulls at the flaps of his elmer fudd hat... then calmly walks away. the camera pans until we discover :}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<A>__{in his trademark black mariani suit. he's been watching the whole thing, standing in the smouldering field only a few feet away, holding a rose patterned cup and saucer of tea... he takes a sip and turns to address the camera }
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{good evening.}
<A>__{he places his cup daintily back on the saucer.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{brother has been slaying brother since cain and abel, yet even i did not see that coming. i was as blind sided as poor henry over there.}
<A>__{he glances back over at the murder scene.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{apparently the authorities shared my naivete and believed the young man's tale that henry fell and hit his head on a stone and died of smoke asphyxiation.}
<A>__{he shrugs: `who would've thought it?'}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{of course if they hadn't believed him, ed never would have had the opportunity to commit the heinous acts for which he became famous... and we wouldn't have our little movie. instead, we'd have more nice, safe, predictable ones like these...}
