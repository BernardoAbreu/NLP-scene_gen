<L>__{exterior freeway underpass later that night}
<A>__{about 2 a.m. the street's empty. cesar's darkened apartment is tucked away in the distance. now a lone figure emerges and beats a path through the projects... closer now... it's cesar. white t shirt, sagging gray dickies... following him now... as he crosses the edge of a dirt lot. focusing on his doc marten boots and their waffle soled printerior..}
<L>__{exterior freeway underpass night}
<A>__{merging with cesar as he slinks down the dark alley corridor. lighting a blunt off his zippo lighter...}
<B>__{further down}
<A>__{cesar spray paints a wall with a can of black enamel painterior he takes another hit. chokes down a shit eating grin. and admires his work... a goofy dog smoking a blunt. ... below the dog he scrawls the word, "cartoon." above it, "k.o.s. as he slips the spray can into his front pocket, he senses a presence..}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{... 'at you, stevie?}
<A>__{profound silence. grin dissolves. riveted, cesar takes another slow hit off his blunt. suddenly a coyote darts past him.}
<C>__{cesar}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{... hells, man. stupit dog.}
<A>__{his sick smirk returns. but only momentarily. now a premonitory flicker registers on his face. he blinks as a masai arrow splits the darkness and pierces his left pectoral muscle. exhaling a stunned breath, cesar looks down at the arrow. an incredulous, stupefied laugh escapes him as he pulls the arrow out of his chest and studies it... the normal length of the arrow's been shortened by half and the tip has been fitted with a modified hypodermic needle. (the needle extends from a rubber stopper which has retracted into the hypodermic casing, causing the solution in the hypo to jettison through the needle and into cesar).}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{... mutha fuck.}
<A>__{now back pedaling, stumbling, dropping the arrow, he turns and runs off.}
