<A>__{mackelway moves cautiously, being pelted by rain. but now he can see inside the living room of this home: it's a bit of a time warp: plastic on the furniture, an old radiator, pictures on the mantle in antique frames. and an old lady, leaning over a record player. tough to hear what's playing we're outside, and that storm is pounding but it sounds like glenn miller. there's also an old tv in here: "wizard of oz" is on it. the lady is 70, frail, thin. she also happens to be blind. cataracts on her eyes. her name's delia. mackelway watches her... as she exits the room, heading for the kitchen. he moves to another window.}
