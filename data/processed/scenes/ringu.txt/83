<T>__{cut :}
<A>__{to asakawa and ryuji walking up the gravel path towards the rental cabins. ryuji looks back over his shoulder as both he and asakawa stop before cabin b4. the cabin is on stilts, its underbelly fenced off by wooden laticework. ryuji drops most of his supplies to the ground, but keeps hold of the pick. he raises the pick over one shoulder and begins smashing away at the latticework. when he has cleared enough space for passage, he begins picking up supplies and tossing them hastily within. when finished, he holds a hand out for asakawa. the two enter the earthen basement. under cottage b4 day ryuji pulls a flashlight out, flicks it on. the beam arcs outwards, illuminating what looks more like an old mine shaft than a modern rental cottage. the beam halts when it suddenly encounters an old stone well. the well is badly chipped on one side, and sealed off with a solid looking stone lid. ryuji rushes quickly towards it.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{i knew it! the well.}
<A>__{he squats down beside the well, setting the flashlight on the lid. asakawa sinks slowly down beside him.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{the well...}
<A>__{ryuji reaches out and takes asakawas hand. he sets their enclasped hands onto the lid, and together they begin lightly tracing the surface of the lid with their free hands. asakawa closes her eyes in concentration... and suddenly, as with the incident on the beach, asakawa finds herself drawn into ryujis psychometric vision.}
<B>__{flash}
<A>__{the picture is black and white, grainy like old film. a young girl in a white gown walks slowly towards an open well. she places her hand on the lip of the well, peers curiously down.}
<B>__{flash}
<A>__{asakawa looks up, her eyes wide open.}
<B>__{flash}
<A>__{there is now a second person in the vision, an elderly man in an old fashioned tweed suit standing behind the young girl. he suddenly produces some bladed object, and strikes the girl savagely across the back of the head. the girl falls forward. the man drops to the ground, grabbing the girl behind the knees and hoisting her limp body over the lip and into the well. the body falls into its depths. panting heavily, the man leans forward and grasps the lip of the well with both hands, looking down. he flashes a guilty look in either direction, checking that his crime has gone unnoticed, and as he does so asakawa realizes that she knows this face. the image from the videotape, like a face in the moon: it had been sadako inside the well, looking up to see this man staring back down at her. this man whose name is professor ikuma heihachiro.}

<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{her own father!}
<A>__{the energy seems to drain out of asakawa in a rush, and her body crumbles. ryuji catches hold of her.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{it was ikuma who put this lid on. and sadakos still inside.}
<A>__{ryuji stands quickly, takes hold of the crowbar. he inserts it under the lid and begins trying to pry it off, face scrunched with effort. asakawa digs her fingers in and lends her own strength as well. slowly, the lid begins to move. ryuji tosses the crowbar aside and the two lean the combined weight of their bodies into it. the lid slides off, dropping to the earth with a dull thud. ryuji sits to one side, winded with effort, as asakawa takes hold of the flashlight. she shines it down into the well, but it only seems to intensify the gloom. what water she can see looks fetid and brackish. ryuji sees her expression and begins removing his jacket.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{ill go.}
<A>__{he walks off, leaving asakawa alone.}
