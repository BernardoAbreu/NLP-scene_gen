<D>__{e.s.u. in an eight man line looking for the run on third and short.}
<A>__{the ball is snapped. waymen fakes a handoff to his fullback, hides the ball on his hip, fades to pass. on the sideline, coach winters yells, "pass! pass!" alvin's not fooled by the run, he shakes his blocker and takes dead aim on waymen. just as waymen releases the ball, alvin blasts him, driving him into the turf.}
