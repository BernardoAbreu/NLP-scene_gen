<L>__{interior george's garage morning}
<A>__{george is swallowing two pills as robin knocks on the half open door, opening it all the way in the process.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{is your back still killing you?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i didn't think you'd come today.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i kept thinking about it, what you said... i hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no. mostly me.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{peter left me yesterday.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{left you?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{no goodbye. no fuck you. no 'are you in love with george?'}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{'i will be in the bedroom.'}
<A>__{robin walks to george and holds on to his shirt.}
<C>__{robin }
<D>__{i couldn't walk in there.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so he left.}
<A>__{she rests the side of her head against his chest. he kisses her hair. outside, a hammer beats a reminder that they're not alone. the ocean drowns the sound long enough for robin to kiss george's chin; and in that instant, the instant where everything but the touch washes away, george kisses robin with such punch that it knocks them onto the bed. they continue to forget everything as they roll with the punch.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{dad, dale needs to know..}
<A>__{sam stops at the jamb of the open door as his mother and father scramble to their feet from the bed.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i had a kink in my...}
<A>__{as george falters, robin feels compelled to complete the lie.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{back. neck. back.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{the door was open.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(a quick confession)}
<D>__{i don't know what i'm doing.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i wouldn't let adam or ryan see you doing it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it won't happen again.}
<A>__{george and robin are flustered, embarrassed by being caught, something sam clearly relishes.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for christmas lights with a switch inside?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{have him put it on a separate line. at christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make god wear sunglasses.}
<A>__{sam laughs, grabs the door and closes it on his parents. robin slumps, truly embarrassed.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i could die.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{so could i.}
<A>__{george touches robin's chin, draws her head up. he stares at her, afraid to say what he needs to say.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{are you going to kiss me?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's not my back that's killing me.}
<A>__{robin furrows her brow, not understanding. george surrounds her head with his hands and kisses her forehead.}
