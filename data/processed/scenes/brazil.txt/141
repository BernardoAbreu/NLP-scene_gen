<L>__{interior lingerie department shopping centre}
<A>__{to the lush sound of musak we glide through the glittering sensuous, supportive world of ladies undergarments. as we slip past girdles, bras, panti hose for a variety of exotic occasions we come upon sam and jill pushing a shopping trolley. in the trolley is the "suspicious" parcel which jill was given at the power plant.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{this is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{are you still following me?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{please, jill ... i love you.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{go away.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{there are plenty of other safe places. why don't we go back to my flat?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{leave me alone!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you've got to trust me. it sounds silly but i know we were meant to meet.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{you mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i vas just trying to help. i decided to trust you. maybe i was wrong. whose side are you on really? who are your friends? who was the man who gave you the parcel? what's in it? it's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... it must he something very special.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{........... it's a bomb isn't it?}
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{oh ... jesus!}
<A>__{sam grabs the parcel from the trolley and tries to start tearing it open.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm going to open it!}
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(grabbing parcel and trying to take it from him)}
<D>__{no you're not!}
<A>__{they start an ugly little struggle for the parcel. sam's suit gets slightly ripped. their tug of war is interrupted by a voice off camera.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{sam!!}
<A>__{sam turns to see mrs terrain and shirley a short distance away. mrs terrain is heavily bandaged and sitting in a wheelchair which shirley is pushing.}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{it's me and shirley!}
<A>__{from the terrains' pov sam looks as if he is wrestling with a dummy, or with himself if he is beside a full length mirror. the mirror or something obscures jill. mrs terrain and shirley exchange puzzled looks and proceed toward sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{ah ... hello, mrs terrain. sam lets go of the parcel and pushes jill away. she moves off.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(after jill for mrs terrain's benefit)}
<D>__{i think that'll hold it.}
<P>__{(to shirley)}
<D>__{hello shirley. just helping someone tie up a christmas present. how are you?}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{my complication had a complication, but dr chapman says i will soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. are you buying a christmas present for your mother?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(trying to keep an eye on}
<D>__{jill who is disappearing}
<P>__{from sight)}
<D>__{er, yes ...}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{shirley and i come here regularly. i love romantic lingerie.}
<A>__{she unwraps a set of red and black, fur trimmed things with strategic holes in them.}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<P>__{(coyly)}
<D>__{picture me in these.}
<A>__{at this moment there is an almighty explosion from the far corner of the store. it is the corner that we last saw jill moving towards. sam races towards the smoke, dust covering his suit. he finds bras, knickers, broken shop dummies, bleeding customers and shop assistants all over the place. on the edge of this devastated area he sees jill struggling out from under a pile of negligees and plaster dust. he rushes over to her.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(frantic)}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(anxiety giving way to anger)}
<D>__{you don't deserve to be! you should be dead, or maimed like them .... how could you ...?}
<P>__{(indicating the wounded)}
<D>__{what a bloody stupid thing ... i should. have made you open it in the lorry}
<A>__{she has dug the parcel out of the debris and has ripped it open. under the brown paper are a dozen brightly coloured. christmas packages yes you guessed it executive toys. she throws the parcel and its contents hard into sam's chest. he topples back wards tangling himself up with the severed limbs of a shop dummy.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{there's your bomb! our annual bribes for official ass holes like you!}
<A>__{sam sits in the debris ashamed and relieved. liquor oozes from the broken bottle all over sam's suit. he is at a loss for words. jill's attention is attracted by moans coming from the badly hurt bomb victims. she goes to help them.}
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{come on, make yourself useful, there are people hurt!}
<A>__{jill goes around trying to make the injured comfortable. sam follows her. he takes off his jacket with his information retrieval badge on the lapel and uses it to make a pillow for one of these victims. by now sirens are wailing, water sprinklers are functioning, and there is general pandemonium. security guards run into the area and begin arresting everyone, including the dead and injured. one of the guards tries to drag off the woman whom jill is attending.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{hey stop ... she's hurt!}
<A>__{the guard gives jill a thump in the side of the face with his gloved hand. sam sees red.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{don't touch her!!}
<A>__{the guard looks up and as he does so he is transformed into the giant warrior from sam's dream. he towers over the wounded, the dying and the debris of the blasted lingerie department. sam grabs for a weapon and comes up with one of the arms (now detached) of the shop dummy. it makes a passable club.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{sam .... don't!!}
<A>__{the two combatants square off ... looking for an opening ... a chink in the other's defences at which point sam is flattened from behind by a trooper's gun butt.}
