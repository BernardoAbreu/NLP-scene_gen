<L>__{interior dirigible, dining room}
<A>__{muntz leads carl and russell into the dining room and up to a large table.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{so how are things stateside? almost tempted to go back a few times, but i have unfinished work here... please.}
<A>__{dogs pull back chairs for them. they sit. dog waiters place napkins on their laps.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{i hope you're hungry because epsilon is the finest chef i've ever had.}
<A>__{dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove the silver plate covers at the same time. the meals look delicious.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{oh, epsilon, you've done it again!}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{yes!!}
<A>__{russell is served a hot dog. his waiter can't resist and eats a bite.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{another dog pours some juice then takes a big slurp from his glass.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{carl looks around, still enthralled.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{oh my ellie would have loved all this. you know, it's because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by paradise falls.}
<A>__{he gestures toward his house, tethered outside the porthole window.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{i'm honored. and now you've made it!}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you're sure we're not a bother? i'd hate to impose.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{no no! it's a pleasure to have guests a real treat.}
<A>__{the dogs erupt into excited barking.}
<C>__{dog walla}
<D>__{treat?! treat! i want a treat!}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{no no, quiet! calm down. calm down...}
<A>__{in the excitement a dog swipes the rest of russell's hot dog.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{muntz}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{shouldn't've used that word... having guests is a delight. more often i get thieves, come to steal what's rightfully mine.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{muntz picks up a lantern and walks to the back of the room.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{they called me a fraud, those... dah! but once i bring back this creature, my name will be cleared.}
<A>__{the lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples, feathers. hundreds of them... all of the bird. kevin. this is muntz's obsession. he looks over to a full size skeleton.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{beautiful, isn't it? i've spent a lifetime tracking it. sometimes years go by between sightings...}
<C>__{muntz }
<D>__{i've tried to smoke it out of that deathly labyrinth where it lives... can't go in after it. once in, there's no way out. lost so many dogs...}
<A>__{muntz is lost in reverie.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{and here they come, these bandits, and think the bird is theirs to take! but they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place.}
<A>__{distracted russell finally notices the skeleton.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{hey, that looks like kevin!}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{"kevin?"}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{yeah! that's my new giant bird pet. i trained it to follow us.}
<A>__{muntz and alpha exchange glances.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{follow you? impossible. how?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{she likes chocolate.}
<A>__{russell holds up a chocolate bar to show muntz.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{chocolate?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{yeah, i gave her some of my chocolate. she goes ga ga for it.}
<A>__{carl swipes the chocolate from russell and pockets it.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{but it ran off! it's gone now.}
<A>__{muntz stares. he walks to a table full of flight helmets.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{you know, carl. these people who pass through here, they all tell pretty good stories. a "surveyor" making a map.}
<A>__{using his cane, muntz topples a helmet from the table. it rolls across the floor.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{a "botanist" cataloguing plants.}
<A>__{muntz topples another helmet. he lifts a third to show carl.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{an old man taking his house to paradise falls.}
<A>__{he drops the helmet. it rolls to carl's feet.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{that's the best one yet. i can't wait to hear how it ends.}
<A>__{carl glances around nervously. out the window, sitting on the roof of his house, sits the bird!}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{well! it's been a wonderful evening, but we'd better be going.}
<A>__{carl gets up and pulls russell from the table.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{oh, you're not leaving?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{we don't want to take advantage of your hospitality. come on russell.}
<A>__{carl leads russell toward the door.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{but we haven't even had dessert yet.}
<A>__{muntz follows behind them slowly, menacingly.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{no, the boy's right. you haven't had dessert. epsilon here makes a delicious cherries jubilee.}
<A>__{carl pulls russell along, muntz following behind like something out of a bad dream.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{oh, you really must stay. i insist! we have so much more to talk about!}
<A>__{a distant haunted wail. everyone stops.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{kevin?}
<A>__{muntz walks to the window and looks out. atop the roof he sees the bird.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{it's here.}
<A>__{he turns back to carl... but they're gone.}
<C>__{muntz}
<P>__{(to dogs)}
<D>__{get them!}
