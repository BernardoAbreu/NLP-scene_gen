<L>__{interior forge night}
<A>__{conan awakens to the familiar sound of a hot blade sizzling as it hits the cooling vat. but this is no dream of his father's forge as he looks up to see fariq holding a sword, its tip still red hot, the flames of the fortress's forge behind him. conan's thrusts forward, only to find his armed chained around a heavy mortar and stone pillar. fariq strokes his newly acquired scar.}
<C>__{fariq}
<D>__{at last you awaken, cimmerian. it's been hours you've made me wait for my fun.}
<A>__{conan says nothing, but his eyes scan the room, taking in everything.}
<C>__{fariq }
<D>__{you made me lose face in front of my father. that wasn't wise. but what should i expect from a cimmerian?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{a swift end!}
<A>__{conan strains at the chain, ripping the skin beneath his shackles but a thin wisp of mortar comes loose from the pillar.}
<C>__{fariq}
<D>__{hardly. but that is a difference between you and me. a swift end would be a mercy i do not intend to grant. no, you must suffer for your transgressions.}
<C>__{fariq }
<D>__{you must beg for your suffering to end. just as your people did.}
<A>__{he waves the glowing sword tip in front of conan's face.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{you lie. i was there. my father never uttered a sound.}
<A>__{fariq laughs, amused.}
<C>__{fariq}
<D>__{you were there? what were you doing, warrior? watching your father die, without saying a sound? taking your eyes will be justice indeed, coward.}
<A>__{fariq pushes the hot tip of the sword against conan's skin. conan's face reddens with pain, but he doesn't utter a sound. but as conan pulls on his chains more mortar falls. as fariq turns back to place the sword in the forge, conan notices one of the bricks the chains are fastened to is}
<B>__{loose.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i saw my father die. slain by one who can only kill men already on their knees.}
<A>__{fariq turns, his eyes blazing. he glances over at the two guards by the door, who try not to listen.}
<C>__{fariq}
<D>__{i've killed many in battle, cur.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{really? then why did your father not let you face me before, when i had sword in hand. he thought you unequal to the task.}
<A>__{fariq responds by pushing the red hot blade against conan's chest. conan just yells back at him.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{coward! prove your strength!}
<A>__{again, fariq pushes the hot blade against conan's skin.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{take my eyes, coward if you can.}
<A>__{fariq yells and thrust the tip of the sword at conan's head. conan lifts his manacles, forcing the blade up into the brick holding his chain. then conan pulls on the chains with all his might, loosening the heavy brick, which falls to the ground. in one powerful movement, conan begins swinging the chain with the mortar block on the end, a homemade ball and chain. the two guards come forward, sword drawn, only to meet with a crunching blow by conan's weapon. both their heads get caved in. fariq rushes conan, getting in too close for conan's wide swings. conan simply meets fariq's sword with the heavy chains, then encircles fariq's neck with the steel bonds. fariq chokes, falling to the ground, gasping for air. but conan doesn't kill him yet.}
<B>__{the forge}
<A>__{a vat of molten steel bubbles in a cauldron within the forge. conan uses tongs to lift the cauldron out.}
<B>__{fariq}
<A>__{conan kicks him onto his back. fariq's last vision is that of conan, tipping the cauldron, the hot iron descending toward his eyes. fariq screams. conan reaches down and picks up fariq's sword. the sword conan's father made for him.}
