<A>__{benjamin sitting at a table, an old man to look at but no more than twelve, busy playing with magnets...}
<C>__{benjamin }
<D>__{until...}
<A>__{we see a refined, genteel old woman, wearing a hat and gloves, a suitcase at her feet, flanked by an old dog, just inside the front door...}
<C>__{benjamin }
<D>__{hello...}
<C>__{the woman}
<D>__{i'm moving in today.}
<A>__{and just then queenie appears, the baby on her hip...}
<C>__{queenie}
<D>__{welcome... we was expecting you...}
<P>__{(to benjamin)}
<D>__{could you show her upstairs?}
<C>__{queenie }
<D>__{she will be staying in mrs. rousseau's old room. i will be right with you with some fresh towels...}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{we don't usually let dogs in the house.}
<C>__{the woman}
<D>__{he's as old as the hills. blind too. can hardly get around, he won't be a bother much longer.}
<A>__{benjamin, like any young boy, immediately pets the old dog...}
<C>__{queenie}
<D>__{i guess as long as he stays out from underfoot.}
<A>__{benjamin helps her with her bags showing her up the stairs...the old dog dutifully following them...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{i'm benjamin...}
<A>__{the woman starts to tell him her name... but we don't hear it because...}
<C>__{benjamin button's }
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{as hard as i try, i can't remember her name. mrs. lawson, or mrs. hartford, or maybe it was maple? it's funny how sometimes the people we remember the least, make the greatest impression on us.}
