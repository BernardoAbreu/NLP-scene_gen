<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{pass is only good for one person, if that's your idea, which i think it is... besides, i can't risk traveling around up there in the company of a big gringo with a dumb ass cover story about coffee beans.}

<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{i've got money. i will buy the pass from you.}

<D>__{sicarios. death squads. avoid those dudes at all costs.}
<A>__{same scene few moments later the ferry pulls up to the dock. the dock street is a culture clash of shanty bars and amazon indian traders, of big wheel suvs and mule carts. there's a definite air of menace.}

<D>__{federales are looking for someone.}
<A>__{gordy follows armstrong's look to two plain clothes federales, one fat and one thin, standing near the dock watching the boat pull up. when gordy glances back, armstrong is gone.}
