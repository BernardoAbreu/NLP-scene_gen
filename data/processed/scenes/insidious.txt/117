<L>__{interior living room, new house night later}
<A>__{the lights have been dimmed. josh sits on a single person lounge chair. elise sits opposite him. tucker and specs set up around her, fixing their cameras in place. renai leans forward on the couch opposite, chewing her nails to the quick. lorraine is next to her.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{remember who you are and why you are traveling. keep one foot in this world.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you ready?}
<A>__{josh nods. renai hugs him and they hold onto it. she whispers to him, staring into his eyes.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{i want you to know something...you have never been less than good enough for me. you've always been perfect for me. you're my best friend...my soulmate. i love you so much.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{i love you too. i have since the first time you looked at me. i don't exist without you.}
<A>__{elise drifts over to the piano, lifting the metronome from it. she sets it down in front of josh, freeing the weighted swing arm so it moves back and forth.}
<B>__{tick...tick...tick.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{close your eyes, josh...and relax. breathe deeply. let all life around you fade out into the background...until the only thing you can hear is the ticking of the metronome.}
<A>__{we push in on josh, inhaling and exhaling. tick...tick...tick.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{focus on a spot in the center of your forehead. feel that spot getting further away as you drift off to sleep.}
<A>__{we are now in an ecu of josh. tick...tick...tick.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{i want you to relax your physical body and let the astral body gain strength...feel it rising out of your chest.}
<A>__{renai watches, literally and figuratively on the edge of her seat. tucker and specs take notes from the corner. josh breathes deeply. eyes shut tightly.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{detach yourself.}
<A>__{josh's eyes open suddenly and he stands up, frustrated, marching across the living room.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{this is useless...i have no idea what i'm doing and you just suddenly expect me to...}
<A>__{he turns around and stops dead. his words trail off.}
<B>__{he is looking at himself.}
<A>__{he sees his own body, sitting in the armchair, eyes closed. elise is sitting opposite, with her back to the josh who is now standing. the living room is exactly as it was only renai, lorraine, tucker and specs have disappeared. they are nowhere to be seen. stunned into mute shock, josh stares at his own body in the armchair. slowly, elise turns her head away from the josh in the chair, staring eerily into the standing josh's eyes. she can see him.}
<C>__{elise}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{now you are free.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{keep your guide, and a steady stride...and into the further you go.}
<A>__{she turns back to the josh in the chair. the room seems to have darkened even more somehow. josh turns and glares into the darkness of his hallway as it yawns outwards, eventually swallowed by complete blackness. he is not in another world. he is in his own house. note the following scenes are not going to be "movie quiet". they will be inhumanly quiet. there will no score. only sound scape. this is another world and should feel so. josh moves forward, gliding down the hall slowly. he looks down and sees that his feet are slighty raised off the ground. he is floating. he moves into the darkness of the hall...past the bedroom doors and closet doors. as he floats past, he scans every darkened corner for the slightest trace of movement. he reaches the front door. he moves towards it and as he does it opens.}
