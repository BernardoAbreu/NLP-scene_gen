<L>__{exterior city street}
<A>__{evey looks up and sees a man standing mostly in shadow.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{excuse me? uh... excuse me, mister?}
<A>__{the man turns around. it is not v.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{would you like... uh, would you like to sleep with me?}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i mean, for money.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{that is the clumsiest bit of propositioning i've ever heard.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{oh god, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{is this your first time, darling?}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{yes, no, i mean for money. but i know what you want and i will do it.}
<A>__{she presses her body to his, using her little girl eyes and her woman's mouth.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{anything you want, mister. please, i need the money. i know i'm young but i promise i know what i'm doing.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{no. you don't know what you're doing.}
<A>__{he pulls out his wallet and shows her a badge. the sight of it knocks the breath out of her.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{christ, you're a fingerman.}
<C>__{fingerman 1}
<D>__{give the little lady a prize.}
<C>__{fingerman 2}
<D>__{i've got something to give her.}
<A>__{evey turns and there are more fingermen behind her.}
<C>__{fingerman 1}
<D>__{prostitution is a class h offense. know what that means? it means that we get to exercise our own judicial discretion }
<C>__{fingerman 2}
<D>__{and you get to swallow it.}
<A>__{the fingermen laugh.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{oh god, please. it's my first time. please don't hurt me.}
<C>__{fingerman 1}
<D>__{gosh, fellas, look at those big innocent eyes. what do you think?}
<C>__{fingerman 3}
<D>__{spare the rod, spoil the child.}
<A>__{fingerman 2 laughs hard as he drops his pants.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{oh no!}
<A>__{he shoves her face first against a brick wall, lifting her dress to expose her bottom.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{please, don't!}
<C>__{fingerman 3}
<D>__{you heard the man, sweetie. this rod's for your own good.}
<A>__{suddenly, they are no longer alone.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{"the multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him."}
<C>__{fingerman 3}
<D>__{what the hell }
<C>__{v}
<D>__{"and fortune, on his damned quarrel, smiling, showed like a rebel's whore."}
<C>__{fingerman 1}
<D>__{we're police officers, pal.}
<C>__{fingerman 4}
<D>__{we're with the finger.}
<C>__{fingerman 3}
<D>__{so bugger off!}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{"disdaining fortune with his brandished steel, which smoked with bloody execution."}
<A>__{in the clenched fist of black leather, we see a flash of steel.}
<C>__{fingerman 1}
<D>__{he's got a knife!}
<A>__{v attacks and at once we know this is no normal human being. a single blow sends the largest of the fingermen flying backwards. but more than his strength, it is his speed. a gun is cocked but before the hammer falls, a knife is buried in the fingerman's chest and before the body falls, the knife is gone. it takes a handful of seconds and three bodies lay on the ground. v turns to the last fingerman who is struggling to pull his pants up.}
<C>__{fingerman 3}
<D>__{jesus christ! don't hurt me!}
<A>__{v steps forward and he screams, bolting while holding his pants up.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{good evening.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{who who are you?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{me? i imagine all manner of names shall be heaped upon my humble visage but, for now, let us simply say i am the villain.}
<A>__{he throws wide his cloak and bows deeply to her.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{and you would be?}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{evey.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{they hear sirens rushing towards them. in a blink, he scoops her up and dashes into the shadows of a narrow alleyway.}
