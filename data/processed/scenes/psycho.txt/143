<L>__{interior norman's parlor behind office (night)}
<A>__{norman sits in the dim, one lamp light, the phone next to him, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to move his hand after hanging up. he is staring at the shrike like bird which is perched on the lamp shade. decision and resolution are beginning to show in his face. suddenly he rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking the bird off the shade. he watches it fall, does not try to catch it. it hits the floor with a thud and sawdust spills out. he stares sadly at it, for a moment, then tends down, scoops up the sawdust, tries to press it into the split seam, picks up the bird, puts it in a drawer. then he puts out the lamp, goes out, crosses the darkened office and goes outside.}
