<L>__{interior slate's office day}
<A>__{slate is practicing hitting golf balls into an automatic putting cup. lava and some office workers are checking a blueprint against a model of "slate city" which is made out of fibrerock. a ball shoots back at slate, who tees up again.}
<B>__{inside the putting cup}
<A>__{a little mouse in a complete hockey outfit jumps to catch the ball. stopping it with his little hockey stick, the mouse gasps, raises its hockey mask.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{whew. and it's still pre season.}
<A>__{he whaps the ball to slate again.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{slate tees up the ball again. fred barges in, banging the door. startled, slate drives the ball instead of putting it. it sails across the room and shatters a picture of mrs. slate.}
<C>__{slate}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{flintstone!}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(undeterred)}
<D>__{mr. slate we gotta talk }
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{we do, eh? about what?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{about those guys outside, mr. slate. some of 'em, well, they been here for years. and you, well, you can't lay them off just like }
<P>__{(snapping fingers)}
<D>__{ that!}
<A>__{slate looks at lava, who shrugs. slate looks back at fred, stays surprisingly calm. he toys with the putter, balances it on his palm.}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{of course i can, fred. i can lay them off like }
<P>__{(snapping fingers)}
<D>__{ that, or like }
<P>__{(a different style snap)}
<D>__{ that, or like }
<A>__{he does a really nifty snap which combines with a buck and wing with the putter.}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{ that.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(bravura slipping)}
<D>__{oh, you can, huh?}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{of course he can, flintstone. it's his quarry.}
<C>__{slate}
<P>__{(still calm, warm)}
<D>__{that's right. why }
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{i could lock the front door and go fishing if i wanted!}
<A>__{lava laughs along with the office staff and slate. fred chuckles a little to fit in.}
<C>__{slate}
<P>__{(winking)}
<D>__{why, i could even fire lava here if i wanted.}
<A>__{lava quivers with mock surprise. everyone really laughs, now.}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{or...}
<P>__{(wiping away a tear)}
<D>__{i could fire you, fred.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(guffawing)}
<D>__{me! ah, ha, that's rich, mr. slate, that's }
<A>__{suddenly fred stops laughing.}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{flintstone, lava, here, recommended that you be in charge of public relations to get fibrerock off to a good start. i'm a member of that public, flintstone, and i have to say... this isn't a good start. i'm getting a bad feeling about fibrerock. a bad feeling about... you. you want that feeling to go away, don't you?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{uh... well, gee, i... uh, yeah.}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{good. then turn around and walk out of here and we'll forget all about this.}
<A>__{fred swallows, looks at lava, goes meekly out.}
