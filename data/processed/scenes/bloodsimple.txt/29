<L>__{interior meurice's apartment day}
<B>__{low wide shot living room}
<A>__{it is dark, lit only by the morning light leaking in around the drawn blinds. it is a small modern apartment such as one sees in large apartment complexes shag carpeting, built in bar. in the extreme foreground the small red "power" light of a telephone answering machine glows in the darkness. the front door opens in the background, spilling bright sunlight. meurice stoops down, picks up two newspapers, enters, and shuts the door. he walks toward the camera and his hand enters frame in extreme foreground to punch the rewind button on the machine. his hand leaves frame. a few pieces of mail are flipped down onto the machine table, piece by piece, as the machine rewinds. he reaches down again and hits playback. after a beep:}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{hi meurice, this is helene, helene trend, and i'm calling 'cause i wanna know just what the hell that remark you made about sylvia's supposed to mean...}

<C>__{woman's voice}

<A>__{the mail stops dropping; marty has meurice's attention.}
<C>__{marty's voice}
<D>__{...i'm not saying you took it but the place was your responsibility and i told you to keep an eye on your asshole friend. don't uh, don't come to the bar tonight, i've got a meeting. but tomorrow i want to have a word with you, and with ray if you can find him.}
