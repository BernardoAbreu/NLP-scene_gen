<L>__{interior tall men in hall day}
<A>__{the tall men walk steady and alert, ready to kill. they enter azul's block and scope out the cells. the bodyguard, seeing the tall men, retrieves his shotgun from under his mattress and grabs his machete from under the sink. he stands ready to fight. the tall men move slowly towards the big cell, somewhat cautious. they see the bodyguard a second too late, for he sticks the shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them before they can react. the shot one stumbles back into his buddy's arms. azul's bodyguard, amused by all this, opens his cell door effortlessly, and walks out as if to greet them. the tall men hear the sound of the other cells opening, so they turn around. the other prisoners on the block begin exiting their cells, carrying guns and molotov cocktails. the tall man drops his gun. finally, azul exits his cell carrying his phone. the bodyguard forces the tall men into an empty cell, closing and locking the door. azul presses the # button on his phone. moco's phone number is automatically redialed. moco answers.}
