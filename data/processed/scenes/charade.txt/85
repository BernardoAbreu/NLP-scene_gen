<A>__{as reggie and dyle enter from his room. she leads him to the bed.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{take off your shirt and lie down.}
<A>__{as reggie goes to the bathroom, dyle takes off his torn shirt, revealing a torn and bloody t shirt. he lies face downwards on the bed. reggie returns, carrying cotton, gauze, tape, scissors, and disinfectant. she sits next to him and lifts up his t shirt to examine the wound.}
<C>__{dyle}
<P>__{(wincing)}
<D>__{listen all i really want is an estimate.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{it's not so bad. you may not be able to lie on your back for a few days but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?}
<A>__{she wets the cotton with disinfectant and begins cleaning the wound. he winces.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{does it hurt?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{haven't you got a bullet i can bite?}
<A>__{she continues working on his back, cleaning it, then bandaging it while they talk.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{are you really carson dyle's brother?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{would you like to see my passport?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{your passport! what kind of a proof is that?}

<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{alexander.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{is there a mrs. dyle?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{yes, but we're divorced.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{i thought that was peter joshua.}
<C>__{dyle}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i'm no easier to live with than he was.}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(finishing the bandage)}
<D>__{there you're a new man.}
<A>__{as they continue talking, he rises from the bed and goes into his own room. reggie remains on the bed, watching him through the open door as he puts on a fresh t shirt and shirt.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{i'm sorry i couldn't tell you the truth, but i had to find out your part in all this.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{alex how can you tell if someone is lying or not?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{you can't.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{there must be some way.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{there's an old riddle about two tribes of indians the whitefeet always tell the truth and the blackfeet always lie. so one day you meet an indian, you ask him if he's a truthful whitefoot or a lying blackfoot? he tells you he's a truthful whitefoot, but which one is he?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{why couldn't you just look at his feet?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{because he's wearing moccasins.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{oh. well, then he's a truthful whitefoot, of course.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{why not a lying blackfoot?}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{which one are you?}
<C>__{dyle}
<P>__{(entering, smiling)}
<D>__{whitefoot, of course.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{come here.}
<A>__{he goes to the bed.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{sit down.}
<A>__{he sits.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{i hope it turns out you're a whitefoot, alex i could be very happy hanging around the tepee.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{reggie listen to me }
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{oh oh here it comes. the fatherly talk. you forget i'm already a widow.}

<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{there, you said it.}
<C>__{reggie}

<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{serious. when a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. i don't want to be serious and i especially don't want you to be.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{okay i will tell you what we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous how about that?}
<A>__{she starts kissing him on the neck, on the chin, on the cheek.}

<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{whoever it is won't give up and neither will i.}
<A>__{the phone continues to ring and she continues to kiss him. finally, reggie reaches out to the bedstand and takes the phone off the hook. she brings the receiver up to their mouths and mumbles into it.}
