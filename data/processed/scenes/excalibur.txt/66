<L>__{exterior wood by camelyarde castle day}
<A>__{the castle can be glimpsed through the trees. a clear spring bubbles from the ground, and the sun splashes leaf, bird, squirrel, and bee with golden light, and arthur and guenevere too. guenevere is serious and intent on her work.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{owww...}
<A>__{with water from the spring, she is bathing a large cut on his chest that has been stitched closed. wounds on his arms, and one on a calf also show evidence of her neat sewing. she's just finishing, and she dabs his chest with a dry cloth.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{it didn't hurt too much, did it?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{ye...}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{ i'm pretty good at stitchery. i've sewn my father's wounds more than once.}
<A>__{he starts to get up.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{careful! you'll have to stay still for a few days or you'll tear them open.}
<A>__{arthur shivers at the thought.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{but i have to leave tomorrow. the forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{ and damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i didn't know leondegrance had a daughter.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{well, then, i shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.}
<A>__{arthur smiles at her, enjoying her jealousy, and it irritates her a little.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{no, i think it's better if you just stay here to heal. at least a week.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i'm going.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{quiet, or i will sew up your mouth too.}
<A>__{she touches his lips with hers, her eyelids fluttering shut. he stares at her young beauty, and draws her into a long, slow kiss. a shrill almost human squeal pierces the air not far away. arthur pulls away startled, half rising. guenevere giggles.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{would you rescue me from a fiery dragon, sir?}
<A>__{she puts her arms around him, drawing him close again, speaking in a half whisper.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{it's just a furry little rabbit that took the bait and sprung the trap.}
<A>__{they smile at each other, about to kiss. as they come closer:}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{you'll find him served up to you tonight, cooked in a most excellent sauce...}
