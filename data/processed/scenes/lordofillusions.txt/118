<A>__{ahead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole, laying pipes. the camera doesn't focus on this action, but we're aware of it.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i told you. i don't }
<A>__{she stops. looks ahead of her. her face is suddenly ashen and clammy. harry follows her gaze to: the hole. somebody is in it, digging. earth emerges in shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{god no! oh god no!}
<A>__{she backs away from the hole. the nurse grabs hold of her.}
<C>__{nurse}

<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{he's not! he's not!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{who's not?}

<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{let go of her, mr. d'amour!}
<A>__{the nurse breaks harry's hold on jennifer, who slips away instantly, racing towards the street.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{jennifer!}
<A>__{she scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the top. there's a screech of brakes, then the smashing of metalwork and glass. harry gets to the wall before the nurse. hoists himself up onto it. looks down. harry's p.o.v. of street jennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the wheels of a car. the driver is out, and yelling incoherently.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{he slips back down the wall, and leans against it. he looks towards the hole. the workman has stopped digging. his mud encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from a grave. harry closes his eyes.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(very quietly)}
<D>__{jesus.}
