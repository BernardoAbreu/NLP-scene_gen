<L>__{interior hospital room days later}
<A>__{stauffenberg's bandages are gone a black patch covering what had been his left eye. the chain with the cross and ring from nina hangs around his neck. another patient lies motionless in the next bed. a man's belongings tell you more about him than he ever could. stauffenberg's side of the room is neatly arranged, books of poetry and philosophy are well worn. beside them are his own writings the print meticulous and flowing. up to a certain date. after that a new, child like hand has taken over. a family photograph shows the stauffenberg's of another generation wealthy aristocrats from a bygone era. he is a teenager in this photo and smiling broadly. a smile he left in africa. stauffenberg's three fingers push a cotton ball under his eyepatch to dab the empty socket. then he goes to button his shirt. holding his collar in his teeth, he tries to do the buttons with the use of only three fingers on his left hand. it is heartbreaking to watch. he is about to give up when he notices a figure looming in the doorway. general olbricht. he winces at the sight of stauffenberg's deformities.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i don't know what i ever did with ten.}
<A>__{olbricht manages a smile, he moves to speak, but stauffenberg beats him to it.}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{i'm wanted in berlin.}
<A>__{olbricht nods.}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{are you asking as a member of the high command?}
<A>__{olbricht contemplates his answer. he carefully closes the door behind him, nervously glancing at the patient in the next bed.}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{you can speak openly, general. he died just before you came in.}
<A>__{awkward moment. finally:}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{we could use your help.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i'm a field officer.}
<A>__{olbricht steps closer, speaking openly now.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{this war can't be won in the field.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{that's unfortunate for me.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{you can't honestly believe you'll make a difference on the front }
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i'm a soldier, general. i serve my country.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{it makes no sense. you opposed hitler, you opposed the war.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{the people chose otherwise and here we are. now we have to win. you know what will happen if we don't.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{if we win, it will still be hitler's germany.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{we all took an oath, general.}
<A>__{olbricht nods, resigning. he realizes it is no use. finally, he produces a blue velvet box, opening it to reveal a brilliant gold medal.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{on behalf of the fuhrer.}
<A>__{stauffenberg takes the medal and studies it.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i'm a twin, you know.}
<A>__{olbricht is as confused as we are.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{i... i didn't.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{my brother died the day after we were born.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{what the hell is he talking about?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i was lying in the desert, covered in blood, sure i was going to die. i tried to think about my wife, my children... but my mind kept drifting to my dead brother. how i would finally be with him. how i would finally be whole again...}
<A>__{he snaps out of his thoughts, holding up his arm.}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{this is my reward for what happened to my men. it's all i deserve.}
<A>__{stauffenberg nonchalantly tosses the medal into a nearby bedpan.}
