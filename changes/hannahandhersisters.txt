<CHAR>__{ELLIOT } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{God, she's beautiful.}
<ACTION>__{Lee glances over her shoulder, then turns from the doorway and walks away.  The camera follows her, moving across a book-and-photograph-filled bookshelf that obscures her from view as she walks into a crowded, comfortable vestibule. People, some holding drinks, some just entering the apartment, surround her.  Everyone is talking at once, carrying on easy, familiar conversation.}
<CHAR>__{ELLIOT } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}

<DIAL>__{Hi, how are you?}
<ACTION>__{Two more guests enter the apartment; the vestibule is full now.  Still walking, Lee lightly hugs one of the children as she continues on her way towards the living room.  Elliot's voice, as well as the jazzy music, is heard.}
<CHAR>__{ELLIOT } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{I just want to be alone with her and hold her and kiss her...}
<ACTION>__{Lee walks into the living room, turning her head back for a moment to talk to the child she has just hugged.}
<CHAR>__{ELLIOT } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{...and tell her how much I love her and take care of her.  Stop it, you idiot.  She's your wife's sister. But I can't help it.}
<ACTION>__{The camera is still moving with Lee as she smiles and stops to chat with her mother.  Elliot's voice, as well as the music, continues over the low din of warm conversation.}
<CHAR>__{ELLIOT } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{I'm consumed by her.  It's been months now.  I dream about her.  I- I, I think about her at the office. Oh, Lee.}

<DIAL>__{What am I gonna do?}
<ACTION>__{Lee starts to walk off again, finishing her conversation with her mother.  She passes several other guests, then turns to greet April, giving her a warm, brief hug.}

<DIAL>__{I hear myself mooning over you, and it's disgusting.  Before, when she...}
<ACTION>__{Elliot's voice-over continues as he is actually seen, standing in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing, rotund man.  Both are holding drinks as Lee, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, walks between them.  The space is very tight; the men hold up their drinks to make room for her.}
<CHAR>__{ELLIOT } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{...squeezed past me in the doorway, and I smelled that perfume on the back of her neck...}
<ACTION>__{Elliot watches Lee walk off; the other man, oblivious, continues to talk.  Elliot reluctantly returns to the conversation, but he can't help turning his head to gaze at the offscreen Lee as the other man chatters on.}
<CHAR>__{ELLIOT } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{...Jesus, I, I thought I was gonna swoon!  Easy...}
<ACTION>__{The camera resumes following a smiling Lee.  She has just put down the tray and drinks near April, and briskly and obliviously, she walks past a doorway where Elliot, still ruminating, watches her, entranced.}
<CHAR>__{ELLIOT } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{You're a dignified financial advisor.  It doesn't look good for you to swoon.}

<ACTION>__{Mickey starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to: A beautiful snow-covered church downtown, complete with courtyard and wrought-iron fence.  A pedestrian walks by with an umbrella.  A church choir sings a soaring hymn over the scene. The music continues as the film moves inside, where the choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold.  A fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film cuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands underneath some stained-glass windows, watching and listening to the inspiring music. The choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father Flynn in his office. He picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his window and he walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his desk, already holding several tomes.  Father Flynn puts the books on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door. Next is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression. His eyes, especially designed to blink as the lights hit them, open and close repeatedly.  The hymn plays on, loudly, as the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside a barber shop window, looking at the Christ playing and shuffling from side to side to gets its eyes' 3-D effect. Smaller inspirational pictures border the bigger, blinking Christ.  A barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby; passing traffic is reflected in the window. Mickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open- air-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving pedestrians. With the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly. Mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating him.  He's just entered his apartment.  He closes the door and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag. He switches on the light, and walking past his spiral staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he makes his way to his living room coffee table.  Mickey pulls a crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on the table near a pile of books and some objets d'art.  He then takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on top of the crucifix.  Then out comes a framed picture of a saint.  It too gets put on the growing pile.  But the bag is not yet empty.  Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and a large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise.  Mickey sets them on top of the saint.}

<ACTION>__{"You Made Me Love You" starts to play as the movie cuts to the street outside Mickey's apartment house, an old building complete with a red entrance door and a gray, weather-beaten facade.  Trees line the sidewalk.  Holly and Mickey emerge from the door and walk up the street, revealing a whole row of similar apartment buildings.  They pass a few other people as they walk. The film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and stainedwood cafe.  Through the window, Holly and Mickey can be seen having lunch.  Holly is talking animatedly; Mickey takes a sip of coffee.  Some people pass by. Next, the film cuts to an almost isolated path in Central Park, complete, with old-fashioned streetlamps and scattered leaves.  Holly and Mickey stroll into view, deep in conversation.}

The Marx Brothers, as well as the hundred-odd other cast members in Duck Soup, are kneeling and bowing as they sing "Hidee-hidee-ho." They kick their heels up in the air.

Mickey and Holly continue their stroll as "You Made Me Love You" begins to play in the background.
