<L>__{interior mall food court day}
<A>__{ronnie is hanging out with dennis and the bouncer from o'charley's. behind him, nell works the counter at cinnabon.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you guys should have been there today. we were just solving shit left and right. i mean, that's what this job is supposed to be like. busting loiterers and kids who steal pennies from the fountain has its rewards, but really getting in there and closing cases is where it's at. it's rewarding too because at the end of the day, you know you've done something good for the world.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{what are we doing here, ronnie? i thought you said they were giving away free chick fil a sandwiches.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well what is your name anyway?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{charles.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well, my young apprentice. i called you here today because as head of mall security, i have decided that it's time to take protection to the next level. in other words, i alone cannot combat this recent crime wave. in order to help me in my personal journey, i have decided to divide up the tasks between my soldiers. so, for now on, dennis, my right hand man, you will be in charge of solving the case of who is robbing the mall. little chucky, you will be on the case of the pervert. you are both to collect data and provide it to me. i will analyze the data, draw conclusions, and solve these crimes as well as coordinate and strategize with various law enforcement agencies.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{since we're going to be doing a lot of the work and you're going to be solving the crimes, do we at least get paid?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you can't measure honor in dollars and cents.}
<A>__{ronnie looks over at the cinnabon and nell waves to him. ronnie smiles back and waves at nell.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{is that your girlfriend or something, ronnie?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{who me? nah, man. why? what do you think of her?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{she's not my type, but that's just me.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, but, you don't think she's kind of hot?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{are you blind? give me a break. wait, are you sure she's not your girlfriend?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{fuck no. there's no way i'd date that... person who's obviously not hot.}
<A>__{nell waves again, but ronnie just kind of turns away, ignoring her.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{anyway, our new unit will operate under the name, 'special elite task force.' you will answer directly to me and no one else. now, let's all put our hands in the middle and do a unifying cheer.}
<A>__{ronnie puts his hand out. dennis puts his in as well. charles isn't sure.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{you're gonna hook me up with a job, right?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{seven even. i promise.}
<A>__{charles puts his hand in as well.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{one, two, three, task force!}
<A>__{ronnie is the only one who gets into it. it's a weak ass cheer.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{okay, so now i say we all take a celebratory trip to sears because, as we all know, today is half price day on all automotive parts for mall employees.}
