<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior a warehouse day}
<A>__{a paper target, in the shape of a human being, dances in place as it is riddles with gunshots, each shot hitting the target in the belly, each shot fired by larry, whose been shooting a sleek automatic pistol from which he's just discharged an entire clip. the gun is empty, larry turns to sam, who stands next in line.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(looking at the target)}
<D>__{you shoot alright.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{gets the job done.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{all in the stomach, though. your man might live.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{not for long.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{long enough to shoot back.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's been known to happen.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(a challenge)}
<D>__{why don't you go do better, then...}
<A>__{without a word, sam pops a new clip into the gun and shoots the lights out of several other human targets, hitting each target in a different place. one he clips between the eyes, the next in the heart, one in the groin, and then the last target he splits down the middle, firing shot after shot from the head to the groin until the target is sheared in half. larry is impressed in spite of himself.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{yeah, well... my way works too.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{my way is better.}
<A>__{in a corner of the warehouse gregor has set up a table loaded with computers and electronic whizmos. right now gregor is holding a particularly high tech type cell phone in his hands, looking at it almost lovingly.}
<C>__{deirdre }
<D>__{is it alright?}
<A>__{another angle deirdre sits nearby, looking at the cell phone.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{it's quite satifactory.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{good, because it cost enough. there's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.}
<C>__{gregor}
<P>__{(almost caressing the phone)}
<D>__{i intend to. this phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat a link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand. with my custom hardware and this phone i can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{you sure about this?}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{i'd stake my reputation.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{but would you stake your life, that's the question...}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{in this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.}
<A>__{from off screen we hear munching. it's larry inhaling a sandwich. a malicious look comes over swede's face, who's cleaning a pistol and sitting near larry.}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{you should watch what you eat.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{i'm just worried about your health, larry. you could stand to shed a few pounds.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(sensitive about his weight)}
<D>__{and you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?}
<C>__{swede}
<P>__{(sensitive about the dumb blonde thing)}
<D>__{who you calling dumb, dickless?}
<A>__{both men eyeball one another, and then suddenly larry reaches for his piece, and as soon as he does this swede does the same thing, but before they can do anything deirdre's gun swings into frame, smashing swede in the face and dropping him to the floor. larry's mouth drops open in surprise, but it's too late: deirdre kicks him in the stomach and then rabbit punches him in the back of the neck, driving him to the ground.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(standing above them)}
<D>__{next one of you fuckers plays this game i'm going to do for you myself. i won't say it again: we don't have time for this shit! there's a clock running on this job, gentlemen, and i mean to be on schedule.}
<A>__{a tense moment as deirdre stares down at these tough guys letting them know who's in charge. a sound from off screen interrupts this moment: a door opening, as we see vincent, who stands in the door, wearing his coat and hat. he's been out somewhere, and he looks first at the squabbling men, and then at deirdre. she gives vincent a little nod a silent command that makes vincent turn to sam.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{let's go for a ride.}
<A>__{vincent and sam start off, moving towards the door, while swede and larry slowly pick themselves up off the ground.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{where to?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{to see a man about a thing.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i can do that.}
