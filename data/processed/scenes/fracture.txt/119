<A>__{willy stares into crawford's eyes. then he looks around at the vibrating metal box carrying him hundreds of feet above the earth. the sunlight glare in the scratched windows. the blur of the rotors against the empty sky. the edges of the door frame. the rivets in the roof. crawford's eyes. amused. willy unbuckles his seat belt, lurches toward the pilot }

<C>__{willy}
<D>__{wait! wait look!}
<A>__{willy is pointing at jennifer shocked as the med tech lets him up and they kneel by her, the med tech taking her pulse willy, staring down at her, intent: she's breathing.}

<D>__{yes. yes.}
<A>__{willy whirls around to crawford. who's frowning.}
<C>__{willy}

<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you're gonna be okay?}
<A>__{she squeezes his hand. very weakly. crawford is looking daggers: die, bitch. jennifer's eyes fixed on willy roll back. she fights it.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{jennifer? hang on.}
<A>__{something sad in her wordless gaze. as it starts to fade.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{jennifer?! jennifer?!}
<A>__{she's slipping. her eyes gone empty. her hand becoming lifeless in his.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{no. come on, jennifer. fight back.}
<A>__{tears well up in willy's eyes, but he struggles against them feeling crawford's gaze, refusing him the satisfaction.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{don't let go.}
<A>__{but she's gone. he stares down. mourning her. letting his grief slowly burn into rage. he gently reaches up and closes her eyes. then he looks up at crawford, who smiles sympathetically.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you pushed it, willy. we didn't have to be here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but now you're my witness. you saw: i didn't touch anything, i didn't do anything. the machine went down. anybody asks you'll have to tell them. what you saw.}
