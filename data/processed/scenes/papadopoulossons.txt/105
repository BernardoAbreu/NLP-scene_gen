<L>__{interior the three brothers living room. day 11.}
<A>__{harry and hassan are sitting in the living room. spiros sits between them. almost like a referee. hassan drinks a cup of tea.}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{it's not just fish and chips.}
<C>__{spiros}
<D>__{there's room for all of us.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what do you want hassan?}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{remember when we were children? when we were friends. we weren't greeks, turks. respectfully, i would like you to take your kebabs off the menu. this is a fish and chip shop.}
<C>__{spiros}
<D>__{what do we get?}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{i won't do fish.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you don't do fish hassan.}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{you are going to put us on the street.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's business.}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{it's not about business. perhaps you would not be like this if we were greeks.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i will tell you what. we'll take kebabs off the menu, if you ask your son to stay away from my daughter.}
<A>__{hassan thinks about this. he sips his tea.}
<C>__{spiros}
<D>__{more tea?}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{no. thank you. this is very difficult.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{come on. it's easy.}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{my son is his own man.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{right. there's no deal.}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{is this because he's turkish? because he's a muslim?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh no. i don't have a problem with that.}
<C>__{spiros}
<D>__{harry's not like that.}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{because he works in a kebab shop? is that it?}
<C>__{spiros}
<D>__{yeah. harry's more like that.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i would ask you both of you to respect a man's aspiration for his daughter.}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{i have similar aspirations for my son. spiro, perhaps you should remind your brother where he is now. tell him to look around. perhaps he still sees a big mansion with gardens and servants. well, i don't. but more importantly, neither does my son.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{this is only. we'll be gone in a couple of months.}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{i hope so. it's going to be a very long couple of months.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{for both of us.}
<A>__{hassan finishes his tea. there is an uncomfortable silence. at this moment theo comes in with a camera and takes a photo of the three men sitting together.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{say cheese!}
<A>__{flash. the scene of the three men is captured as a still photograph. music 5000 lies by george zambetas.}
