<L>__{interior the casino night}
<A>__{by now the group has made its way into the casino. some of them are crowded around the crap table; senator geary is with the enormous and beautiful yolanda, who barely speaks english. there are other girls with some of the men; not with michael, who gambles dollars while talking to corngold.}
<C>__{corngold}
<D>__{our information is that castro is dead. there are maybe a few hundred die hards in the sierra muestra; but government troops are going to clean them out any day.}
<A>__{johnny ola approaches michael.}
<C>__{ola}
<D>__{mike, can i talk to you.}
<A>__{michael follows ola toward the baccarat table; a watchful bussetta moves, a distance away, with them.}
<C>__{ola}
<D>__{listen, this senator from florida already has a hundred grand worth of markers on the table.}
<A>__{we can see senator ream at the table, making thousand dollar bets on the bank.}
<C>__{ola}
<D>__{they asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{let him gamble.}
<C>__{ola}
<D>__{okay. you know he doesn't have that kind of money.}
<C>__{fredo}
<D>__{mike said let him gamble.}
<A>__{fredo puts his arm around his brother; he is high with the first attention mike has ever given him, as though finally he is being taken seriously; as though his brother needs him.}
<C>__{fredo}
<D>__{mike, i got something special up my sleeve for these boys. you ever hear of "superman?" and i don't mean the comic book.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{fredo}
<D>__{wait'll you see!}
