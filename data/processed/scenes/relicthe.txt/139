<L>__{interior pipe night}
<A>__{the mayor follows behind with the group as kawakita and d'agosta lead the way. the pipe is dry and rusted. they move forward with stealth. in twenty feet the pipe ends abruptly in darkness. d'agosta steps out first.}
<L>__{interior cavern night}
<A>__{the group huddles at the mouth of the pipe, confused, as d'agosta pans his flashlight around the huge space. the walls are carved out of dirt and rounded like a cave. from the ceiling hang huge cobwebs. there's a large pile of sticks in one corner fashioned rather like a bed. on a mound of dirt beside this bed rests a battered duffel bag. greg moves to it, shines his light on the side. a name is written in marker.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{what does it say?}
<C>__{kawakita}
<P>__{(looks up, shocked)}
<D>__{dr. john whittlesley.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{what's that doing here?}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{i don't know. i thought dr. whittlesley died in south america.}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{look. there's a ladder at the end. i think it goes up to the street!}
<A>__{they move forward into the darkness eagerly, towards the ladder which leads up to a manhole. but as they pass the bed of twigs, something loud crunches underfoot.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{d'agosta shines his light down and everyone freezes. then one woman screams! the wide dirt floor around them is carpeted in clean white bones! the humming noise is louder and we see its source. atop the bones is the body of cuthbert! it's covered with black dermestid beetles. they're stripping the skeleton clean, devouring the flesh! the group panics and breaks for the ladder. kawakita and d'agosta once more guard the rear.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{dear god. where are we, lieutenant?}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{i'd say we're in its home.}
