<D>__{santiago comes back, with nothing there's no meat on the bone. it's hemingway's ego defending itself again; he's trying to prove he can still perform.}
<C>__{gilfond}
<D>__{...what hemingway's saying, michael, is that we are alone that when we go out too far we're vulnerable. the irony, that santiago is beaten by the sharks, doesn't make him less of a hero.}

<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{i will be right back.}
