<L>__{interior incinerator room night}
<A>__{the steel door at the top of a concrete flight of stairs swings open and st. luc appears. he quickly negotiates the steps and opens the steel door at the bottom which leads to the incinerator room. once inside, st. luc grabs the poker hanging from an iron hook sunk into the wall of the incinerator, slides open the bolt on the door and opens it. he begins to probe around inside the incinerator oven but can't really see very much. he looks around and notices the superintendent's flashlight stuck up on top of a heating pipe. st. luc takes down the flashlight, switches it on, and continues his search for the dead parasite.}
