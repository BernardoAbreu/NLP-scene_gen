<L>__{exterior ant mound day}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{he did it! z! z! z! z! z!}
<A>__{the "z" cheer goes up, with everyone joining in. but the jubilation is short lived, for, appearing on the ridge, surrounding the workers, is formica's army, circling the mass of workers, backing them in towards the roiling water behind them. formica himself appears in the front lines, with carpenter and mandible at his side.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{z. i should have known. all that work, all that preparation, come to nothing. all because of one stinking ant.}
<A>__{he steps forward to address the surrounded, trapped workers.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{alright. which one of you is z?}
<A>__{the workers, trembling but silent, cower inside the unbroken circle of soldiers.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{what are you, deaf? i asked you, where's z?}
<A>__{formica laughs, shaking his head.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{folks, you may have survived that flood, but there's no way you're gonna escape from me. i will make you a deal. hand over the rebel leader z, and you survive.}
<A>__{this sends a ripple of murmurs through the workers.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{but if you don't hand him over, you're all going to die, each and every single..."individual" one of you.}
<A>__{the workers all look at each other.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{what shall it be, workers?}
<A>__{the workers remain frightened but silent. z trembles, terrified.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{have it your way.}
<A>__{as formica raises his swagger stick to order the attack, a lone figure steps out from the crowd.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{wait...}
<A>__{z stands there, shivering with fear.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{...i'm z.}
<A>__{for a moment, z stands alone, under the glare of formica's gaze. then another figure steps out from the throng of workers.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{no, i'm z.}
<A>__{z turns, astonished, to see weaver, still and unwavering, bravely risking his life for his friend. then, azteca also steps forward.}
<D>__{aztecai'm z!}
<A>__{next, bala comes forward.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{no, i'm z.}
<A>__{more and more ants step forward.}
<C>__{workers}
<D>__{i'm z! i'm z! i'm z and so is my brother! i've been z for weeks now!}
<C>__{queen}
<P>__{(regally)we are z.}
<A>__{now, the workers are all shouting the same declaration.}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{i am z! i am z! i am z!}
<A>__{z is plainly flabbergasted. formica is outraged. he gives the signal.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{attack!}
<A>__{the army swells forward on all sides, pushing the workers towards the swirling water. some workers surround the queen to protect her. all seems lost, when the fly from insectopia alights on the rim of the horizon.}
<C>__{fly}
<D>__{hey, guys!}
<A>__{the wasp appears on the other side of the horizon.}
<C>__{wasp}
<D>__{it's them!}
<A>__{suddenly, on all sides, a massive insect army appears on the ridge, looking not unlike ambushing indians in a john ford film. formica's soldiers stop in their tracks, awed by the unfolding spectacle. it looks like all of insectopia has turned out: spiders, caterpillars, rhinoceros beetles, all manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up, and now surround the army, dwarfing them.}
<C>__{wasp}
<D>__{are these hooligans giving you trouble, z?}
<C>__{fly}
<D>__{say the word, z, and we kick their butts.}
<A>__{the ant army remains frozen, unsure of what to do nexterior formica is furious. if ants had veins, formica's would be bulging out of his face.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{what are you doing?! attack!!}
<P>__{(berating his army)}
<D>__{come on, you yellow bellies!}
<P>__{(turning on carpenter)}
<D>__{don't just stand there, carpenter! make an example of yourself!}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{uh, actually, we are outnumbered sir...}
<A>__{formica turns towards the insects gathered against him. with his chin raised pridefully, formica steps forward, and charges z!}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{ahhhhhhh!!}
<A>__{formica runs so quickly and with such force that his helmet blows off his head. z's eyes get big, he stumbles backwards, slipping, and formica goes flying over him, toward the whirlpool behind. he scrabbles at the edge of the water, and then tumbles over. for a moment, it looks as if he's gone.}
<C>__{formica }
<D>__{help...help me...}
<A>__{z goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over. formica is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created, which are roiling not far below. he looks up into z's eyes, a new expression crossing his features: fear.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{please...i...i can't swim...help me...}
<A>__{formica goes under for a bit, then his head comes up again but he's not going to be able to stay afloat for long... suddenly he sees a line dropped down. above, z looks down on him.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{i thought you said that the life of one ant doesn't matter.}
<A>__{formica looks at the line...and in that moment seems to realize his error...}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{i guess it does...to the ant.}
<A>__{formica reaches up and takes the line, and is pulled up by z and a bunch of other ants (the line, we see, extends from a nearby spider, one of the cavalry from insectopia). formica is left, broken and alone, by the precipice, while hordes of ants surround z to congratulate him. bala fights her way to his side and the two of them embrace. then the ants pick up z and bala, and, cheering, bear them away. only carpenter stays behind. he walks up to formica, carrying his dented and dusty helmet. he cleans it the best he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen general.}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{sir, if it's any consolation, i still think you're completely worthless as an individual.}
