<L>__{interior lucy's bedroom, sheridan house day}
<A>__{tattered lace curtains sway in a draft beside a bed with a moth eaten coverlet. emily packs lucy's spare clothes into a dufflebag. zips it and walks out.}
<L>__{interior upstairs hallway day}
<A>__{exiting lucy's room, she notes the door to edward and margaret's bedroom, at the far end of the hall, is slightly ajar. succumbs to a natural curiosity.}
<L>__{interior edward and margaret's bedroom day}
<A>__{the door pushes open, emily peering in. a sad little master bedroom with old floral printed wallpaper and water stains on the ceiling. she explores the room, inspecting various personal items aftershave, glasses, hair brush looking for clues to their madness. an alarm clock with a cracked crystal face. she picks it up and it goes off in her hand. gives her a scare. she puts it down. sees something out the bedroom window. steps closer. parts the curtains. in the backyard, by the garden shed, a long rectangular hole has been dug. a shallow grave filling with leaves. edward's handiwork. emily's seen enough, heads for the door. but slows, noticing something odd as she comes back around the bed }
<B>__{a long deep scratch}
<A>__{in the wooden floor, hidden under a long runner rug. emily peels back the rug and finds }
<B>__{hundreds of long deep scratches}
<A>__{in the floorboards leading toward the door. something the old oak bureau perhaps? has been dragged repeatedly across the room. emily comes over and looks behind the door and sees, on the back of it, something even more bizarre }
<B>__{two massive deadbolts}
<A>__{screwed hastily, crookedly, into the wood. she closes the door. slides to the big heavy bolts }
<B>__{clunk. clunk.}
<A>__{pauses. looks again at the bureau. slides it in front of the door, a wheelless caster bracket leaving another long scratch in the hardwood. and it's clear at this point what the deadbolts and bureau add up to a barricade emily stares at it. looks over at edward and margaret's bed, imagining them here behind this door. slides the bureau aside. opens the deadbolts. and as the door swings open she is looking straight down the hall at lucy's bedroom emily stares, bewildered.}
