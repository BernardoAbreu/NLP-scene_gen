<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{leopold sits at the head of the table, kate and charlie banished to either side. leopold chews his dinner incessantly.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{it's called hamburger helper.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{it is beyond help. please serve the next course.}
<A>__{he pushes his plate away.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm afraid there is no next course. if you make a list of the foods you like, i will pick them up at the store for you.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{is all food here this... textured?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{mine's good.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{please understand, i am used to a different sort of preparation. where i come from a proper meal is the result of reflection and study. a recipe is merely a theme which an intelligent cook can plan each time with variation.}
<A>__{charlie gives kate a look.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{several courses are served. menus are often prepared days in advance, timed to perfection. it is said, without the culinary art, the crudeness of reality would make life unbearable.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{in canada?}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(after a beat. firmly)}
<D>__{in canada.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we have a saying here. "shake and shake the catsup bottle, none will come and then a lot'll."}
<A>__{he pours catsup on his dinner.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{how interesting.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{since you're such an expert on fine cuisine, why don't you make dinner tomorrow night?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{it should be obvious to you that i am not a domestic. you may take my plate.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i have my own, thank you.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{charlie...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{who died and made me cinderella?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{young man, there is a distinct impertinence to your voice.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's part of my charm.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{suppress it.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(changing the subject)}
<D>__{leopold... since you're our guest here, there are several cultural events you might enjoy seeing. charlie has season tickets to the ball game. perhaps you'd like to take that in?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what is it??}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{or the opera or the ballet?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what is it??}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{charlie, there's no rule that says everyone has to be interested in baseball.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, but i believe there is a rule that says everyone has to have heard of it.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{dr. coles, your brother charles attitude and demeanor are unacceptable. if i am to stay on here you must have a serious talk with him regarding respect and civility.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{charles, could you help me with the dessert in the kitchen?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{in the kitchen?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{in the kitchen. excuse us.}
<A>__{kate and charlie leave. the camera remains on leopold, sitting alone, calmly sipping his wine. voice over from the kitchen:}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't believe this guy!}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{try to be nice to him.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm always nice!}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{please charlie, as a favor to me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{he gives me the creeps.}
<A>__{leopold reacts. he listens self consciously.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{he's different that's all.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what was that crack about domestics?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{charlie, this is important to me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you're not going out with him, are you?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{eeuuu! i may be desperate but i'm not a lost cause.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{kate, this is me. i've seen the guys you bring home.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i've done countless favors for you! now i'm asking for just one little thing...}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{oh, all right! all right! all right!}
<A>__{they emerge from the kitchen, beaming.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{we forgot the dessert.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you know,... i don't know if i mentioned it... but that is one fine looking suit.}
