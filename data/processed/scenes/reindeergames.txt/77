<D>__{pug.}
<A>__{pug's engrossed in the cartoon. they're singing in whoville.}

<A>__{pug snaps to. shuts off the tv, spits some chaw on the floor and gone. rudy and ashley are left alone.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{nick, oh my god, what'd he do to you? what'd he do?}
<A>__{she touches his bloodied chest. rudy winces badly.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{he had some points to make...}
<A>__{ashley helps pull his shirt off, sees the wounds:}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{jesus christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here }
<C>__{rudy}
<P>__{(near delirium)}
<D>__{all i wanted... was to make it home... for a little of dad's turkey, and mom's stuffing... aunt lisbeth's acorn gravy... aunt mary's cranberry buns...}
<A>__{ashley has leapt to the bathroom. she brings wet washcloths back to clean and dress }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{we'll get there, baby... we'll get there...}

<D>__{...haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{shh, now. rest now. two years, nick. you haven't had cranberry buns in two years.}
<A>__{she kisses him softly. rudy meets her eyes. staring to get his bearings back...}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{you saved my life.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you could have run, but you didn't. you saved me.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you saved me.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i saved you because i love you, nick.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{why'd you save me?}
<A>__{rudy studies her hopeful face, attending to his wounds. still weak and distant:}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{guy i was in with... car thief... i used to read your letters to him. i know they were private... i know, but... you spend twenty four hours a day with somebody, you gotta talk, y'know? you gotta share. or the room gets even smaller.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and sometimes, i'd be reading them, and he'd close his eyes, get a smile on his face... and i'd know somewhere inside he was pretending you were writing to him he'd see your face, your pictures on the wall...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{some nights i think he fell in love with you, too.}
<A>__{rudy touches a hand to her hair.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you gave a couple guys hope, ashley. and with hope, there ain't nothing you can't survive.}
<A>__{ashley stares, touched, still kneading the cloth into his chest. rudy struggles up, his face level with hers. she kisses him tenderly. lingering. and this time rudy responds, mouth seeking, working down her neck. her eyes flutter closed.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i'm sorry, nick... i'm so sorry...}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{don't say my name...}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i love you, nick...}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{ash. don't say it. don't say my name.}
<A>__{ashley hesitates. carefully strokes his chest. he's still kissing her, softly, still somewhat delirious.}
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(a small frown)}
<D>__{i love you...}
<A>__{as he returns to her lips, mouths joining. ashley's eyes close again, as they fold into each other... ...and move slowly, tenderly, back to the floor.}
