<L>__{exterior command center day}
<A>__{roper trudges back in. things are more active now. logistical officers are making flow charts. photos of the hostages are being posted on a bulletin board. roper approaches solis, mccall and the swat captain who are anxiously waiting for his report.}
<C>__{roper}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{we're going to have to take this guy out.}
<A>__{that draws a long silence. that's something roper rarely says.}
<C>__{solis}
<D>__{can't we wear him down?}
<A>__{roper hands solis the handkerchief with the ear in it. solis eyes it with dismay.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i believe there's at least one fatality in there already. the fire alarm was probably set off by gunfire. i believe he's working alone, both from his conversation and the fact that he wouldn't come out beyond the doorway. he was holding a gun on the hostages while he was talking to me. his demeanor is calm and controlled, that's what really scares me. the other bad news is that he also indicated a familiarity with our techniques.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{so, do you want to go in or wait for him to come out?}
<A>__{mccall calmly offers his opinion.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{let him come out. too many unknowns in there.}
<A>__{solis nods. that'll be the plan.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{when we drive up the car, make sure it's at an angle about three feet from the curb.}
<P>__{(to swat captain)}
<D>__{put our best man "highground", twenty degree down angle.}
<A>__{the swat captain motions and turns to one of his underlings.}
<C>__{swat captain}
<D>__{have anderson prep it and notify us when he's on line.}
<A>__{the underling hurries off to take care of it. solis looks at roper dejectedly.}
<C>__{solis}
<D>__{i feel this thing going sideways on us.}
<A>__{roper tries to buck him up.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{there is some good news. he's wearing a ski mask, so he's protecting his identity and hasn't determined to kill all the hostages...}
<P>__{(big pause)}
<D>__{yet.}
