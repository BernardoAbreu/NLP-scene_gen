<L>__{interior deacon's house kitchen day}
<A>__{dress rehearsals. naomi is sitting at the kitchen table talking to ashley, who's wearing a sexy cheerleader outfit. deacon is at the microwave making popcorn.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{five hundred dollars a night?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{yeah, but if you can break into films, like these ones, you can get featured dancing gigs and make ten times that much.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{seriously. if these guys ever get their act together.}
<A>__{matt stumbles in carrying a pile of scripts. fred walks in behind him and sees naomi.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what is she doing here?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{naomi is my girlfriend.}
<A>__{fred exchanges a glance with matt.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{and i wanted her to help out. give the script a female point of view.}
<A>__{fred pulls deacon aside.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{jesus, deacon. didn't you see that beatles documentary on the history channel? you're pulling a yoko ono on us.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{fine. whatever. let's get started. i'm sure she'll be really helpful.}
<A>__{coop comes out of the bathroom dressed as the math team captain, complete with nerd glasses, pocket protector, etc.}
<C>__{coop}
<D>__{oh, hey, naomi.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{hey, coop. are you helping these guys, too?}
<C>__{coop}
<P>__{(sheepishly)}
<D>__{sort of.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{okay, people. places everybody. let's try to do this with a little heart, okay? and action.}
<A>__{everyone turns to their scripts and starts the rehearsal.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{this quadratic equation is so hard.}
<C>__{coop}
<D>__{well, maybe we should just stick to long division.}
<A>__{coop drops his corduroys and naomi gasps. she stares at coop's "slide rule" for a beat, then snaps out of it.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{wait a second. cut. this is all wrong. she wouldn't be fantasizing about some geek.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{he's not a geek. he's the math team captain.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{no, he should be really well dressed, and maybe he's a foreign exchange student from portugal.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{um, and the director is the only one who's allowed to say "cut."}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{who cares, naomi?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{deacon agrees with me, don't you?}
<A>__{matt and fred look at deacon.}
<C>__{coop}
<D>__{dudes, come on. my nuts are getting cold.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i'm out of here.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{shut up, coop. this is important.}
<C>__{coop}
<P>__{(swings his arms out)}
<D>__{and my nuts aren't?}
<A>__{coop's hand accidentally smacks ashley in the nose as she's getting up. she screams.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{coop}
<D>__{i'm sorry, ashley.}
<A>__{she's pissed, holding her nose.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{look. this is ridiculous. who does dress rehearsals for a porno shoot?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{oh, sure. why don't we throw out the script while we're at it and "improvise."}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{guys, i appreciate the money. it's nice to get paid for sitting around doing nothing, but this isn't helping my career. i've got no footage for my reel.}
<A>__{she packs up.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{she leaves.}
<C>__{coop}
<D>__{ashley, wait. i'm sorry. ashley!}
<A>__{then, he blurts out something unexpected:}
<C>__{coop }
<P>__{(calling after her)}
<D>__{i love you!}
<A>__{coop exchanges an awkward glance with the guys: he's said too much. he goes after ashley, with his pants still around his ankles and his bare ass in full display. he stumbles on his pants and falls on his face. he gets up quickly and continues after her, still with his pants down.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{now what are we going to do? your "girlfriend" ruined everything.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{coop's the one that smacked her.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{besides, if you losers knew anything about women, we wouldn't have this problem.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{who asked you?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{i don't have to take this.}
<A>__{she storms off, leaving deacon there to make a decision. he looks at matt and fred for a beat, then follows naomi. fred and matt are crushed.}
