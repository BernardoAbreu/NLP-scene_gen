<L>__{interior neo's cubicle}
<A>__{the entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of elevators. neo slumps down into his chair. a tall employee stands up in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition.}
<C>__{tall employee}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{if i was late again, i'm going to be fired.}
<A>__{he smirks.}
<C>__{tall employee}
<D>__{well, it was nice working with you.}
<A>__{neo glares at him, as he sinks down.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{thomas anderson?}
<A>__{neo turns and finds a federal express man at his cubicle door.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{yeah. that's me.}
<A>__{neo signs the electronic pad and the fedex guy hands him the softpak.}
<C>__{fedex}
<D>__{have a nice day.}
<A>__{he opens the bag. inside is a cellular phone. it seems the instant it is in his hand, it rings. unnerved, he flips it open.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{hello, neo. this is morpheus.}
<A>__{neo's knees give and he falls into his chair.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{i had hoped for this conversation to take place under less adverse conditions, but you can never count on hope, can you, neo?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{... no.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{i've been watching you, neo, and i want to meet you. i don't know if you're ready to see what i want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time. they're coming for you, neo. and i'm not sure what they're going to do.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{who's coming for me?}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{stand up and see for yourself.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{right now?}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{yes. now.}
<A>__{neo starts to stand.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{do it slowly. slowly. the elevator.}
<A>__{his head slowly peeks up over the partition. at the elevator, he sees agent brown and agent jones leading a group of cops. a female employee turns and points out neo's cubicle. neo ducks.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{holy fuckin' shit!}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{one cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the agents.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what the fuck do they want with me?!}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{i'm not sure. but, if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{how?!}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{i can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what i say.}
<A>__{the agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{the cubicle across from you is empty.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{but what if...?}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{go! now!}
<A>__{neo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle just as the agents turn into his row. neo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone tightly to him.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{stay here for a moment.}
<A>__{the agents enter neo's empty cubicle. a cop is sent to search the bathroom. morpheus' voice is a whisper in neo's ear.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{a little longer...}
<A>__{brown is talking to the tall employee.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{when i tell you, go to the end of the row to the first office on the left, stay.as low as you can.}
<A>__{sweat trickles down his forehead.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{now.}
<A>__{neo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around. staying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, shooting across the opening to the first office on the left. the room is empty.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{good. now there is a window. open it.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{how do you know all this?}
<A>__{morpheus laughs quietly.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{the answer is coming, neo.}
<A>__{he opens the window. the window howls into the room.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{outside, there's a scaffold. you can use it to get to the roof.}
<A>__{leaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is several offices away.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{no! it's too far away.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{there's a small ledge. it's a short climb. you can make it.}
<A>__{neo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a concrete chasm.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{no way, no way, this is crazy.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{don't be controlled by your fear, neo. there are only two ways out of this building. one is that scaffold. the other is in their custody. you take a chance either way. i leave it to you.}
<A>__{click. he hangs up. neo looks at the door, then back at the scaffold.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{this is insane! why is this happening to me? what did i do? i'm nobody. i didn't do anything. fuck! fuck! fuck!}
<A>__{he climbs up onto the window ledge. hanging onto the frame, he steps onto the small ledge. the scaffold seems even farther away.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i'm going to die.}
<A>__{the wind suddenly blasts up the face of the building, knocking neo off balance. recoiling, he clings harder to the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand. he watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{this is insane. i can't do this! forget it!}
<A>__{he climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the door.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i didn't do anything!}
