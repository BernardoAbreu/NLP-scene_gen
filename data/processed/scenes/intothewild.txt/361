<L>__{exterior chris' camp beside the stone wall day}
<B>__{an isolated cloud eclipses the sun against a blue desert sky.}
<A>__{ron is sitting on his tailgate, watching chris, backpack on, climb the stone wall.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{alaska?}
<A>__{chris summits.}
<C>__{ron }
<D>__{son, what the hell you running from?}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(yells down from above)}
<D>__{i could ask you the same question. except i already know the answer.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{you do, do you?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i do, mr. franz. you've got to get back out in the world. get out of that lonely house of yours, that little workshop, and go live on the road.}
<A>__{ron waves him off.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{really. you're going to live a long time, ron. you should make a radical change in your lifestyle. the core of man's spirit comes with new experiences. and there you are, stubborn old man, sitting on your butt.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{sittin' on my butt, huh?}
<A>__{ron gets up off the tailgate.}
<C>__{ron }
<D>__{i will show you sittin' on my butt.}
<A>__{and ron starts making the old man hustle. shifty shoulders and all, up the stone wall.}
<C>__{ron }
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{"stubborn old man."}
<A>__{chris is laughing and clapping.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{come on, old man! come on!}
<C>__{ron}
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{ya little pinhead.}
<A>__{chris is jumping up and down, thrilled for ron's efforts. now the old man's shuffle has turned into an old man's walk. but he ain't stopping. and bit by bit he shows he's got it in him after all. as ron is just about to mount the summit, chris extends a hand. ron swats it away.}
<C>__{ron }
<D>__{ya little pinhead.}
<A>__{ron drops down onto his back to catch his breath and let his thumping heart slow down.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you alright?}
<A>__{ron, after taking one more deep breath, sits up and chris sits next to him. he's actually pretty happy with himself. he looks out and sees the distant salton sea.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{i'm going to miss you when you go.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i will miss you too, ron. but you're wrong if you think the joy of life comes principally from human relationships. god's placed it all around us. it's in everything. in anything we can experience. people just have to change the way they think about those things. you ought to put a little camper on the back of your pick up and go take a look at some of the great work god's done out here in the american west.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{alex...you're probably right. and i'm going to take stock of that.}
<A>__{chris offers a skeptical glance.}
<C>__{ron }
<D>__{no, i am.}
<A>__{a second skeptical glance. which ron squashes with genuine sincerity.}
<C>__{ron }
<P>__{(almost to himself)}
<D>__{i am.}
<A>__{chris buys it this time and feels he's accomplished something with ron.}
<C>__{ron }
<D>__{but i will tell you something. the bits and pieces i've put together, you know, what you've told me about your family. your mother and dad. and i know you got your problems with the church too, but there's some kind of bigger thing that we can all appreciate. and it sounds like you don't mind calling it god. but when you forgive, you love. and when you love...god's light shines on you.}
<A>__{miraculously, it is just at that moment that the cloud clears from the sun and the light shines in ron's eyes. chris points at ron's face at the light shining on him }
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{holy shit!}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{i told you about that language.}
<A>__{the two men, their eyes welling up, fall back laughing.}
