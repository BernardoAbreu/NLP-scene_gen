<L>__{interior buckingham palace corridor evening}
<A>__{tony blair and the equerry walk along the corridor, and reach the door. tony shoots his cuffs. clears his throat. the equerry knocks.}
<L>__{interior audience room evening}
<A>__{tony and the equerry enter. both bow from the neck..}
<C>__{equerry}
<D>__{the prime minister, ma'am.}
<A>__{tony walks forward and meets the queen, who, like janvrin, barely smiles, doesn't make eye contact, shakes his hand, and indicates a seat..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{do sit down.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{tony sits, and stares at the queen. her face is inscrutable.}
<C>__{t}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{it's good to see you again. after quite a summer..}
<A>__{the queen's face. stiffens.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{i'm referring to your visit to india and pakistan, where your comments about ending historic disagreements went down very well.}
<A>__{ilence.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{and the commonwealth heads of government meeting. i spoke to the prime minister of malawi, who was saying how much he appreciated your tough stance on nigeria.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i meant to tell you at the time but you were being monopolised rather.}
<A>__{ilence.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i imagine those occasions are quite difficult. twenty four heads of government each clamouring for a private audience..}
<A>__{silence. tony takes a deep breath, then..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{also, we haven't had a chance to speak since that week. and i wanted to offer my apologies..}
<A>__{the queen looks up..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{whatever for?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{in case you'd felt `manhandled' or `managed' in any way.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{not at all. beat.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i don't think i shall ever understand what happened this summer.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{the circumstances were exceptional, ma'am. and in the end, you showed great personal strength, courage, and humility. e}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{ou're confusing humility with humiliation.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{that's not true.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you didn't hear what they were saying in the mall that friday.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i still believe history will show it was a good week for you.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{and an even better one for you, mr blair.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{but there are fifty two weeks in a year, ma'am. and two and a half thousand in a half century.}
<A>__{the queen looks up. thrown by his compliment..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{and when people come to assess your legacy, no one will remember those few days.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you don't feel that what respect or affection people might once have had for..}
<A>__{she wants to say `me', but instead says..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{..this institution has been diminished?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{not at all. pause..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i gather some of your closest advisors were less fulsome in their support..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{one or two. but as a leader one has...a different perspective.}
<P>__{a beat)}
<D>__{i could never have added my voice to the chorus.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you're very kind.}
<A>__{the queen looks at tony, raises an eyebrow..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{but let's also not forget the more pragmatic reason.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{which is?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{that without me there to distract everyone, it'd suddenly become embarrassingly clear how much unchecked power the british prime minister actually has.}
<A>__{tony looks up..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{if fifty years of doing my job has taught me anything, it is that the people doing yours generally prefer me with all my faults to some kind of meddling president..}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{just look at the french.}
<A>__{the queen opens her handbag, and takes out her reading glasses.. e}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{i suppose we'd better get on with the business in hand..}
<A>__{the queen looks out of the window. notices how the sun is setting..}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{i do love this time of day. shall we walk while there's still some sunshine left? i do hope you're a walker.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{good. the clocks go back next week, then it'll be dark by five.}
<A>__{tony and the queen get to their feet.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{i always think these meetings stand a better chance of succeeding if the prime minister is a walker.}
<A>__{footmen open the door as tony and the queen go out of the audience room, and into..}
