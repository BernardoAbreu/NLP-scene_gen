<A>__{random images of a woman (30's, black hair, plain). jump cuts of details: a smile, eating, tucking her hair behind her ear, pulling on a pair of trousers, watching tv, shouting in anger. sitting on the edge of the bed in her underwear, she turns as leonard pinches her thigh.}

<D>__{you can only feel details. bits and pieces which you didn't bother to put into words. and extreme moments you feel even if you don't want to. put it together and you get the feel of the person, enough to know how much you miss them, and how much you hate the person who took them away.}
