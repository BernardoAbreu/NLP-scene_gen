<L>__{exterior kettle high campus continuous}
<A>__{needy and chip walk to an alley behind the school. melting snow drips off the eaves. needy pulls out a large black binder and opens it. it's full of copies from the library and internet printouts. the spine reads "jennifer research"}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{look at this.}
<A>__{she thrusts a piece of paper into chip's hands.}
<C>__{chip}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{demon...demonic...}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{demonic transference. it's something that happens when you try to sacrifice a virgin to satan without using an actual virgin!}
<A>__{chip stares at her.}
<C>__{needy }
<D>__{i think that's what happened to jennifer. those guys from that band were trying to sacrifice her in the woods. but what they didn't realize is that she hasn't been a virgin since junior high! jennifer's a total cum dumpster! it all makes sense now! read this...}
<A>__{she grabs the piece of paper from him.}
<C>__{needy }
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"if the human sacrifice is impure, the result may still be attained, but a demon will forever reside the soul of the victim. she must forever feed on flesh to sustain the demon." see?}
<A>__{chip looks more dubious than ever.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{she's eating boys! they make her strong. really strong. and when she's hungry, she gets weak and cranky and her hair is all full of split ends. and look at this...}
<A>__{she holds up one of the printouts.}
<C>__{needy }
<D>__{it says that before the demon feeds, it vomits a gruesome substance on its prey. like i saw!}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{you you really think jennifer killed jonas and colin?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{and possibly ahmet from india.}
<A>__{needy is silent for a moment. she realizes chip will never believe her and that she'll lose him forever if she continues babbling.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{really? you think she ate those guys?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{no. no! of course not!}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{is that what you think?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{no...listen, i will make an appointment with mr. feely. i'm real sorry about this sudden onset of teenage paranoia.}
<P>__{(robotic)}
<D>__{my hormones and emotions are aswirl, and my moods are erratic...}
<A>__{chip isn't totally convinced, but his face softens.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{it's all right, needy.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{this has been a crummy school year, chip.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{no shit.}
<A>__{needy turns and pitches the black binder into a dumpster.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{listen, i'm done with all that devil stuff. do you know what you're wearing to turnabout?}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{i was thinking a suit with black shoes and a boutonniere, right here.}
<A>__{he taps his chest. needy laughs.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{i was so in love with him. i didn't want to mess it up with my infectious crazy. only i wasn't actually crazy. everyone else was crazy. but when you're the only sane one, you might as well be crazy. it's subjective, you know?}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{what color dress are you gonna wear? i need to order your wrist corsage.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i don't know yet.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{how about magenta? you're definitely a winter. my mom says winters should wear regal jewel tones like magenta. or possibly teal.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{oh yeah, your mom's an avon lady.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{well, they call them "sales reps" now.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{right. well, i will try to find something magenta.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{that'll look dope.}
