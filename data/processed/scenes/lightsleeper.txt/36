<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it was for a while. then came crack and fucked everything.}

<C>__{letour}
<D>__{i gotta stop home a second.}

<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(unconvincing)}
<D>__{chill. this is routine.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{i want to get my lucky jacket.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{oh. okay.}
<A>__{the sedan continues south. it turns, stops in front of john's chelsea apartment building. john hops out, goes in. inside john's apartment he a man possessed pulls his black tweed from the closet, throws it on the futon. he rolls up his shirt, reaches under the futon, removes the .38. he straps the gun to his back, wraps duct tape around his chest, end to end over the .38. he tucks in his shirt, puts on the jacket, checks the mirror to see if the gun shows: it doesn't. a pause to appreciate. letour closes his diary, throws it out the window: a trifle. he slaps cologne on his cheeks annointing; heads toward the door. outside, letour emerges, walks quickly to the car, plops beside ann. the sedan drives off. back seat:}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{that took long enough. what did you do, douche while you were at it?}
<C>__{letour}

<D>__{cologne?}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{for you.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{phew. it smells like that stuff they give you on airplanes. it's no good for your skin. all chemicals.}
<A>__{letour pulls out a slip of paper, writes a name and address: "linda wichel, 1012b 2 a street, sacramento, california."}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{letour}
