<L>__{interior tunnel #2}
<A>__{as rennie skids up to sean, still dazed. she grabs him, shaking hard.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{get up, sean!!!}
<A>__{his eyes blink, only half coherent. then an inconceivable terror registers in her ears...a low, deep rumbling sound, coming from up ahead. her head jerks in the direction of her planned retreat: rennie's point of view an ominously empty tunnel, soon to be filled with the unthinkable. the sound of rushing liquid is growing at leaps and bounds.}
<B>__{tight on rennie}
<A>__{as her trembling chin rises, looking at: angle tunnel #3 ceiling (efx) the dim overhead lights are beginning to vibrate from the approaching flood.}
<B>__{rennie}
<A>__{rotates her head and sees:}
<B>__{jason}
<A>__{vision or no vision, he is lurching towards her relentlessly. she is literally sandwiched between hell and high water.}
<B>__{rennie}
<A>__{drags sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed woman, pulling him over to a service ladder attached to the intersecting alcove wall.}
<C>__{rennie}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{climb!!!}
<A>__{she shoves him up it from below, sean summoning everything he's got to obey her. rennie shoots a stare back down the tunnel... rennie's point of view (efx) the overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake has just hit; the liquid will be arriving any second. her vision whip pans 180 degrees to find jason approaching from the opposite end, groping around with his scaly arms like the claws of a roto tiller. angle ladder as rennie starts up after sean, looking down and seeing:}
<B>__{jason}
<A>__{within ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder like he's working on some kind of radar.}
<B>__{rennie}
<A>__{slips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing. and rushing higher. she takes her final glance into the tunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as she sees:}
