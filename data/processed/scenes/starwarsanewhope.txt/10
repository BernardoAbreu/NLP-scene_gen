<A>__{artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. he snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light begins to flash. the stubby astro robot works his way into the cramped four man pod.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{hey, you're not permitted in there. it's restricted. you'll be deactivated for sure..}
<A>__{artoo beeps something to him.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! now come out before somebody sees you.}
<A>__{artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding the mission he is about to perform.}

<D>__{secret mission? what plans? what are you talking about? i'm not getting in there!}
<A>__{artoo isn't happy with threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps and twangs angrily. a new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris through the narrow subhallway. flames lick at threepio and, after a flurry of electronic swearing from artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod.}

<D>__{i'm going to regret this.}
