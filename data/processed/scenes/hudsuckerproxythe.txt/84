<A>__{in flickering black and white, he is lying on a couch that has been brought into his office, gazing listlessly at a bend straw, being interviewed by someone o.s. the footage is rough, taking a moment to find focus; the sound is tinny.}

<A>__{a shadow is thrown across the screen as a figure steps into the beam. he throws the sharp silhouette of a strict freudian analyst: van dyke beard, pince nez with chain trailing down to his vest, one thumb hooked into the vest, the other hand holding a cigar wreathing smoke, which he waves for emphasis.}

<A>__{as he scores each point it is illustrated on the screen behind him: a patient is forced into a straitjacket by two brawny, unshaven attendants; electricity arcs between two leads on a wire cap being wielded by a technician; and lastly, a steel barred door is slammed shut behind a stooped and broken patient who is led, shuffling, away. here the film runs out, chattering, and the screen goes white. the projector is shut off and the lights go on. the board politely applauds.}
