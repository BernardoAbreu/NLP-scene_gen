<A>__{a thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest. a small group of hardened criminal nine year olds sporting hideous grins, bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks. one kid busies himself shooting a large can of black flag garden spray into a crack in the nest. another stomps half dead wasps up and down the sidewalk. all the kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.}
