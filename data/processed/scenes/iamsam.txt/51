<L>__{exterior walmart day}
<A>__{a police car pulls into the parking lot. sam and margaret in the back. sam and margaret see lucy's little feet dangling from beneath the curtain of the photo booth.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i will go get her.}
<C>__{margaret brown}
<D>__{it would be better if you stay here. i'm sorry to say this, mr. dawson, it's clear how much you love your daughter, but we're going to have to remove lucy from your home.}
<A>__{sam's baffled. one cop places his hand on sam's shoulder, restraining him. the other heads toward the photo booth.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no, no no no. it's her birthday! it's her birthday!}
<C>__{margaret brown}
<D>__{i know how hard this must be...}
<P>__{(cell phone rings)}
<D>__{...hello, betsy. i'm scheduled to come to your apartment at four. no, not five every two hours. it's two every five hours. she only weighs thirty pounds for chrissakes...}
<P>__{(back to sam)}
<D>__{the city has given me the difficult task of deciding when to intervene on behalf of the child. unfortunately, i've learned the hard way that it's better too soon than too late. for now the court will decide what's in lucy's best interest.}
<A>__{sam watches the cop's legs meet lucy's under the curtain. suddenly, sam screams from the deepest core of his being.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{run, lucy, run!}
<A>__{we see lucy's feet kick the cop's legs and wrestle out of his grasp. she flies out the booth, holding that balloon. she runs down the street, the balloon soaring into the sky a cop follows. sam struggles.}
<B>__{on sam}
<A>__{reeling, devastated, we hear a judge speaking:}
<C>__{judge }
<D>__{given the fact that the father was arrested for solicitation, did not cooperate with the police...}
