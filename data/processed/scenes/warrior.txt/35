<L>__{exterior brendan and tess's home night}
<A>__{brendan pulls into the driveway of his modest home, gets out of his camry, and looks to the street, where paddy stands outside his olds, leaning on the passenger door. brendan carries a gym bag and wears work out clothes. he's clearly not happy to see paddy, who stands there, uncomfortable and heavy hearted in the light of the street lamp.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{hey, brendan. it's me, pop.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{what're you doing here?}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{i have some news for you.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{something wrong with your hands?}
<A>__{paddy shakes his head, unsure what he means.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{if there's nothing wrong with your hands then there's no reason for you not to phone. that's the deal.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{yeah, i forgot }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{phone or mail, pop. non negotiable.}
<A>__{paddy holds his hands out, palms down.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{hey brendan, have you ever seen my hands so steady? have you?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i'm going inside.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{i've got a thousand days. a thousand days sober today.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{well, that's great, pop. but it doesn't change anything.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{what do you mean it doesn't change anything? have a heart, brendan.}
<A>__{paddy's words set brendan off. a side of him we haven't seen before emerges. he approaches his father fiercely.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you listen to me. you take your have a heart bullshit and you run it down the road. run it out on someone who doesn't know you like i do.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{c'mon, brendan. i thought maybe we could break bread. open some lines of communication.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you got two lines of communication, the telephone and the post office. just because you decide it's a special day, it doesn't make it one for me. i got a wife and kids inside and they're waiting for me, so i don't have time for whatever this is.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{i know you got a wife and kids in there. i got a grand daughter i haven't seen in three years and another i haven't even ever met.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{why is that, pop? why is that? do you remember having anything to do with that?}
<A>__{paddy nods. casts his eyes down in shame.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{that shit you pulled. never again. and all the shit i saw growing up? that doesn't happen here.}
<A>__{brendan looks at the reformed paddy, a measure of sympathy on his face. then he heads for the house.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{take care of yourself.}
<A>__{as he's halfway through the yard, paddy calls out.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{tommy's back.}
<A>__{brendan stops in his tracks. he turns and looks at his dad.}
<C>__{paddy }
<D>__{he's in the `burgh.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{tommy's in pittsburgh?}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{he came to see me.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{he came to see you?}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{he's over at the house. we're doing a little training at fitzy's. remember fitzy's? it ain't fitzy's anymore.}
<A>__{brendan walks closer. incredulous.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you and tommy are training together?}
<A>__{paddy nods.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{tommy conlon.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{riordan. he's using your mother's maiden name now.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i know what her name is.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{i thought you'd want to know he's back. that's why i drove all the way over here.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i thought you came to break bread over a thousand days?}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{that too.}
<A>__{brendan looks at him. considers.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{did he say if he wants to see me?}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{he doesn't say much. he's just not that happy kid he was.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{wow, look at you. mister inside man.}
<A>__{paddy frowns.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{you and tommy training together like nothing ever happened. this is unbelievable. now i know what you're really doing here.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you came to gloat.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{i did not come to gloat. i came to get my son back.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{well, there you go. you got your son back.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{i'm talking about you, bren }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you got your son back.}
<A>__{brendan starts to walk away, then turns around again.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{you know, part of the reason i stuck around was `cause i thought i'd finally get you all to myself. but you didn't have any interest in training me. tommy was the one.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{ah, brendan. i was a drunk. i mean, you know. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{forget it. you were always a front runner. you never had any interest in underdogs. but i was your son.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{you are my son.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{am i?}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{yeah, you are. i'm just asking you to find just a little space in your heart to forgive me.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah. alright. i forgive you. but i do not trust you. tell tommy this is where i am if he wants to see me.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{alright. but they're not different things. you've gotta trust to forgive }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{goodnight, pop.}
<A>__{paddy looks toward the house, where emily, rosie, and tess stand at the door. paddy waves.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{my god, is that emily? boy, she's grown, brendan. is that rosie?}
<A>__{brendan keeps walking. opens his door to step inside.}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{daddy, who is that?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{just some nice old man.}
<A>__{brendan closes the door, leaving the heartbroken paddy alone in the yard.}
