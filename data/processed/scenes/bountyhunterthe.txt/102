<L>__{ext highway early evening}
<A>__{the cadillac is parked on the shoulder, milo changing the tire, cass standing by the passenger door, still handcuffed,}
<T>__{excited:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{i told you they were trying to kill me!}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{yeah, well, no one's killing you until i get you to jail.}
<A>__{cass whips her head around to look at him:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{you're still taking me to jail? but it's the cops who are after me.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{first of all: that guy was not a cop. second of all, we just left him unconscious in a ditch. you'll be fine.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{but...this is important! this is my job!}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{and this...(pointing between them)}
<D>__{is my job.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{milo, you don't understand what's going on!}
<A>__{milo rolls his eyes and straightens up.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i will lay it out for you: some loser with a minor sheet calls you up and says, hey, i've got a big story for you, you interested? it'll only cost you a couple hundred bucks, and i will tip you onto some criminal activity, it's your chance to expose some bad guys and write the story of your life. then the moron gets himself caught, he's probably in cold storage somewhere, and now you think the bad guys are after you. (beat) see? i get it. i just don't care.}
<A>__{milo finishes with the tire, throws the jack in the back, and heads back around to the driver's seat. cass watches him closely, getting an idea. she reaches into her pocket and pulls out the paper from jimmy.}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{if only i knew exactly when and where this deal was going down. course, if i can't figure out that part, then you definitely can't figure out that part, because we both know i'm much smarter than you.}
<A>__{milo flinches, then forces a laugh.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{please. my brain can dance circles around your brain.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{i don't even know what that means.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{case closed.}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{fine. guess we'll never know.}
<A>__{milo hesitates. then decides: fuck it. he strides around the car and snatches the paper from her hand. he reads:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{"atlantic city. xmas eve. sparrow." what's "sparrow"?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{i knew you couldn't figure it out.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{it's a business.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{casino.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{stripper?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{i don't think so. what kind of strip bars have you been going to, anyway?}
<A>__{milo stares at the paper, wracking his brain. cass sighs loudly and snatches the paper back.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{oh, well, forget it, i knew you couldn't do it.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{please. i could crack that story and still get you to jail on time.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<A>__{cass stares him in the eye and says the magic words:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{wanna bet?}
<A>__{milo stares at her. she stares back. long beat. milo's face is red. he clenches his fists. he unclenches them. fuck. he thrusts out his hand:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you're on.}
<A>__{they shake.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i have to make a call.}
<A>__{he starts to walk away.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{hey. aren't you going to uncuff me?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{why? you going somewhere?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{um...no.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{then you don't need to be uncuffed.}
