<A>__{sure, sure, the wheel turns, the music plays, and our spin ain't over yet. norville's office a small chamber orchestra, the musicians in tails, sit playing "eine kleine nachtmusik". norville, eyes closed, reclines in his desk chair, one uniformed woman stooping in front of him, manicuring his nails, another, behind, massaging his temples. a tailor is pinning up his pant cuffs. a french sculptor wearing a white smock, a beret, and a goatee squints at norville and chisels at a block of marble with a stone chisel and hammer. a goon sits off to one side, hat insolently atop his head, reading the funny papers. at length norville stirs, opens his eyes, sits bolt upright, batting away the hands of the manicurist and temple massager.}
