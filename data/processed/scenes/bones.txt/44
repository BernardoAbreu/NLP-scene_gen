<L>__{interior the building that night}
<A>__{upstairs, inside what was once bones' bedroom. beneath the cracked ceiling mirror, bill lies on the airmattress. he's listening with headphones to a minidisk player. eyes closed, head nodding to the beat. around him, we see something strange. the room shifts. it's the same room. but changed. it looks like it did when the frat boys were trapped in here. or in the instant after jimmy's death: all surfaces seem to be a swirling, shifting pattern in which we can dimly make out faces, as if people were trapped on the surface of things. then the faces and bodies begin to step out of their surfaces and into the room. so as bill, eyes still closed, rocks to the hypnotic beats in his headphones, we see the room around him begin to fill with figures. all twisted dead human forms emerging out of the surfaces of floor and walls. we hear a low murmur of ghost voices, different languages. and as the track ends, the sound cuts through bill's headphones and his eyes snap open. but the room is empty. and completely normal. bill pulls off his head phones. ears strain to listen.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{tia? patrick? that you?}
<A>__{the sounds return, fainter, and form above. bill looks up, and for a fraction of a second in the mirror, bill sees the crowded eerie hell of the other version of the room. bill jolts out of bed and to the door, whips it open, and someone dark looms right there. but it's just patrick.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{spooked?}
<A>__{bill looks back into the room, normal now. glances up at the mirror, just a cracked reflection of the empty room.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no. well, yeah. maybe just a little.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{yeah, there is a strange vibe here.}
<A>__{he stops. both brothers look at each other, waiting for the other to admit he's seen or felt something's here.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{where's the others?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{maurice left. tia's taking a bath.}
