<A>__{a long view from the bottom of the steep embankments above harlem river drive in washington heights. sprayed along the face of the cliff is a disaster an overturned city bus and a car with which it apparently collided. the scene is lighted with flares. police rescue workers and firemen are scrambling up and down the face of the cliff. they are carrying bodies out of the bus and the car, cops pulling them out through the windows, leading them on stretchers. there are shouted orders and some moans and cries from the wreckage. in the foreground is lt. walter simonson, involved in the operation, but also involved in a hassle with doyle, mulderig and russo who are standing with him. an officer approaches simonson with a set of heroin works.}
