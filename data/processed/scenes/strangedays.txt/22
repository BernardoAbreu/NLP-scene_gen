<A>__{lenny doesn't stop to play back iris' message, or any of the twenty others on his machine. he just deadbolts the door and locks a steel bar across the door frame, then carries his haliburton... ... toward the bedroom. and we see the truth of his reality. lenny's crib is a shit box. it is a small one bedroom, barely furnished. a couple of chairs. swap meet couch. cardboard boxes full of tech gear stacked in the corners, unidentified electronics components piled on a table, cables strung everywhere. god knows what this stuff is. there is aluminum foil taped to all the windows. fast food cartons, empty coke cans, pizza boxes everywhere. the bachelor apartment from hell. high tech low life. he goes into the bedroom. mattress on the floor. same infernal interior decoration, but this room is dominated by racks of tapes... squid tapes. lenny pours himself a vodka from a bedside bottle, takes off his clothes and hangs them over a chair. he sits on the bed in his underwear, looking lonely and depressed. this is the private lenny: no plans. no dreams. nothing to look forward to but another day of the hustle. he puts a set of playback trodes carefully on his head, fishes around in a shoe box among a bunch of tapes, squinting at the hand written labels: they all say "faith." only the dates are different. he selects one and inserts it in the deck, makes some minute adjustments. sips his vodka. leans back. closes his eyes. and hits play. play back sequence pov: we are moving along the venice boardwalk, following a young woman on rollerblades. by our motion, it is obvious that we are on rollerblades too, and not doing so well. the woman is laughing, turning circles around us, cracking up at our discomfort. we hear lenny's voice complaining a mile a minute, and we realize the pov is his. the girl takes our hands, skating backward, towing us along the boardwalk. it is a sunny afternoon, and it is the usual boardwalk freak show all around us. the woman is faith justin, a singer. lenny is desperately in love with her. it's not hard to see why. she is beautiful, in an alive, dynamic way. her hair is a wild dark mane, and her eyes are spectacular... intense. she moves with a lithe, sinuous grace. we are staring at her eyes instead of concentrating on skating. whammo! the pov spins and we are sitting, looking up at faith as she circles, laughing. she skates over to help us up.}
