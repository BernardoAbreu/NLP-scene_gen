<L>__{interior beach club card room evening}
<A>__{through the window, the wedding party barbecue has extended into night. lanterns, music, lots more food, lots more drinks. in the distance, on the sand, michael is slowdancing with kimmy. some where nearby, the soft clicking of keys. we pull back to see... ... a small clubby room. books, leather, polished woods. only two people here. walter, looking on stony faced, as a determined julianne grimly "struggles" to "find" what she's looking for in michael's laptop. and then... ... she stops typing. looks at the text on the screen. her eyes sharpen as she "reads" what walter can't see. it's an oscar performance for our desperate girl. she turns the screen around...}

<D>__{mike. i hate this downsizing...}
<A>__{he reads. reads. reads. all the air comes out of him.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{and kimmy doesn't know.}
<A>__{she shakes her head. nope. no way.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(signs)}
<D>__{i will tell her i've reconsidered.}
<A>__{she nods, gravely. right. he looks in her eyes.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you're a smart girl, jules.}
<A>__{she forces up a fleeting smile of gratitude. but walter isn't smiling at all.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{wish my daughter. bad your guts.}
