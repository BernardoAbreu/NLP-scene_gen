<L>__{interior hotel bedroom moments later}
<A>__{ted looks around the still room. no one's there.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{sigfried?}
<A>__{he heads toward the door and, from out of the corner of his eye, he spots sigfried's hairy leg. sigfried has passed out on the floor. angela's chair has been knocked on its side. ted races over to help lift her back up. he pulls the gag from her mouth. angela jumps all over him.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{where's the fucking nitro?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i couldn't find it!}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you took long enough. untie me, for christ's sake, you fucking upset him and he's dying.}
<A>__{ted struggles to untie angela.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i thought you wanted to kill him.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you'd make a great cop, theodore.}
<A>__{the knots are all over the place and a real bitch to untie.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i can't handle this alone, i'd better get help.}
<A>__{ted turns on a dime and runs smack into sigfried, who's been taking in the whole conversation.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{i tie a pretty good knot, don't i, ted?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{thank god you're okay...}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{never felt better.}
<A>__{angela hears sigfried's voice from behind her back.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you bastard!}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(to angela)}
<D>__{come on, honey, don't get mad. it was just a little test, and i'm glad i did it because now i will know forever that you really do love me. truly and deeply.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{if the simple fact that i didn't want your bloated, dead body lying out on the floor is love, then no wonder we find ourselves as we are at this very fucking moment.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{oh, no. i heard you and there was genuine care in that voice. can't be denied. can it, ted?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i think you're right and, if you just keep this kind of open dialogue going, you'll go a long way to resolving this misunderstanding.}
<A>__{ted edges his way toward the door.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you'd be surprised what happens when people just listen to each other without succumbing to all that pain and anger.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you heard shit, monkey boy. easy for you to say after you fuck another man's wife. you should at least have the guts to stand by your convictions.}
<A>__{sigfried turns an icy eye on ted, who has given up all hope of ever getting out of the room.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's a lie, sigfried. i swear to god.}
<A>__{angela continues her tirade.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{when i think of all the times you were inside me promising me a better life, it makes me want to puke.}
<A>__{sigfried slowly raises his gun, pointing it directly at ted's chest.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{why are you doing this? what have i ever done to you people?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{what didn't you do, stick man? unfortunately, you don't have the balls to back up the actions of your huge cock.}
<A>__{the words hit sigfried like bullets to the chest... his legs weaken.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(whimpering)}
<D>__{he's got a huge cock?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{she's lying again, mister. it's not that big.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{show it to me.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{come on, man, she's lying. can't you see she's fucking with you?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{put it this way, god made up for what he did to gumby with ted here.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{show it to me.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{show him your cock, theodore.}
<A>__{sigfried runs over to angela and kneels in front of her.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{stop talking about his cock, will you?!}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{it's hard to stop talking about something so huge. i could go on and on about his cock, bone, nob, bishop, wang, thang, hotrod. hump mobile, oscar, dong, dagger, banana, cucumber, salami. sausage, kielbasa, schlong, dink, tool, big ben, mister happy, prick, disk, pecker, peter, pee pee, wee wee, weiner, pisser, pistol, joint, hose, horn, middle leg, third leg, meat, stick, joystick, dipstick.}
<A>__{angela is on a roll. she fires the words at sigfried, hitting him pointblank. he staggers. he pleads with her to stop, covering his ears. ted watches the man crumble.}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{junior, the little head, little guy, rumple foreskin, tootsie roll. snake, one eyed monster, one eyed wonder, shaft, sword, meat whistle, skin flute, love muscle, roto rooter, instrument, banger, rammer, ramrod, cherrypicker, log, pole.}
<A>__{sigfried tries jamming the sock back in her mouth to stop the flow; she manages to give him a "fuck of a bite" in the process. meanwhile, ted figures this to be his moment to make a move and bolts for the door, only to be tackled by sigfried at the one yard line. after a struggle, the two men rest on the floor, catching their breath in a relaxed embrace.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{please, don't leave me. i will call you ted from now on.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's not me, mister, i swear.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{personally, i don't give a fuck, ted, it's just i don't want to be alone right now. i'm feeling a little vulnerable.}
<A>__{sigfried heaves the gun over his shoulder, grabs a half empty bottle of jack daniel's, and passes it to ted, who takes a hit.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{no guns, okay? just you and me, ted. you know my father used to say that forgiveness is the only thing that evil can't sink its teeth into.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's beautiful.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{kind of nice down here on the floor, isn't it, ted?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yes, actually.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{things take on a whole new perspective... you'd like my trust, wouldn't you, ted?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yes i would.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{i just got one thing to ask you and i will let you go.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay. okay.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{tell me straight now.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{what was it like?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what was what like?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{you know, you and her.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh, for fuck sake, sigfried, what do you want me to say?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{either way you're fucked, right? you ever gonna see her again, theodore?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{if i ever saw her again, i'd run the other way.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{promise?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i promise.}
<A>__{sigfried releases ted and stands up.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{you're lying, but i can respect that, ted. if you told me, it would no longer be a secret, and secrets have a power, kid. you open that box and they disappear forever. a bad secret will rip you apart, but the good one are all you got. in the end, when all the people you knew are dead and gone, all you'll have left are you secrets. and when you die, the box is open and it all blows away dust to dust all the anger, jealousy, desire and love just blow away.}
<A>__{sigfried throws his hand out to help ted up.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{so you know what i say, let's call it a truce, kiddo.}
<A>__{sigfried takes ted by the hand and leads him to an open window. ted is overcome by the sweetness in sigfried's voice and follows him to the window willingly. the two men look out into the dark los angeles night.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm a man of love, theodore. love is all i live for.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i can see that.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{maybe to a fault.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{don't beat yourself up over it.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{that's nice of you to say, ted, but i probably should make a clean break of it, cut her loose and get my own place. i just can't imagine living without her. do you think i should seek professional help?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's not for everyone, but maybe in your case it could help.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{you ever been out on the ocean at night?}
<A>__{ted shakes his head.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i have... scary as a motherfucker, all that darkness around you. it's like a big black carpet rolled out as far as the eye can see. sometimes, if you're lucky, you'll see a light. it could be as small as a little spark, but it will cut a path straight through all that blackness, straight to you. it could be another boat, or some distant fire on an island, but that light will shed a shining path of diamonds cutting through mile after mile of darkness to lie at your feet. that's love, ted, it's like a path of light in an ocean of darkness.}
<A>__{ted and sigfried stare out of the window in peace, transfixed by the glimmering lights of the city. a loud shot rings out, shattering the still moment. the two men spin around. angela stands there with a smoking gun hanging at her side. sigfried drops to his knees. ted checks him out, no blood. angela has fired the gun into the floor below. ted looks up at angela. angela opens the chamber of the pistol and hands the bullets to ted.}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{you'd better go check to see if i killed anybody downstairs.}
<A>__{sigfried is bent over, silently weeping on the floor.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you people gonna be okay?}
<A>__{angela sits next to sigfried and gently strokes his back.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{we're fine, ted.}
<A>__{ted points to a tray with half eaten food on it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{would you like me to...?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{another time, ted.}
<A>__{ted slowly walks toward the door and takes one last look at the strange couple at rest in the corner of the room before closing the door behind him.}
