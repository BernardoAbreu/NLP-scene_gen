<D>__{written by massy tadjedin based on a screenplay by marc rocco april 15, 2003}
<A>__{a pure white screen. idyllic stillness. all of it looking and feeling like the heavens are supposed to. after some seconds of calm, water seems to mist the screen and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest this is a man's p.o.v. then, suddenly, the white screen is tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead man.}
