<L>__{exterior neighborhood day}
<A>__{sharon exits the car and locks it, staring at catch.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{if you're in trouble...}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i'm not.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{if you're in trouble with him, maybe i can help.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{forget about him. somebody i used to know. i don't want to know him anymore. that's all. forget about it. walk with me.}
<A>__{she hesitates, then falls in beside him as he walks on. they walk along in silence, the neighborhood growing more seedy, tougher as they go. catch is relaxing now, trying to push it all away. sharon looks around her.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{this is not a great place to walk.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i like it here. it's fine.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i work here. it's not fine.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{besides the shootings, break ins, rapes, cart thefts? we've got a loose dog raiding garbage cans, knocking 'em over. can't catch him. got somebody blowing a trumpet between midnight and three. can't find him.}
<A>__{as someone approaches them, catch makes eye contact and smiles a small, friendly smile in passing. he gets a brief smile in return. he and sharon amble on. he does it again.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you know everybody here?}
<A>__{he nods to another young man he's never met...}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{how's it goin'?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{goin' uphill, man.}
<A>__{catch and sharon smile.}
<C>__{catch}
<P>__{(to sharon)}
<D>__{you try it.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{try what?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{go ahead. we need this. everybody.}
<A>__{she has misgivings. a young woman is bustling along. sharon makes eye contact and presents a nervous smile and a nod but the woman looks at her sternly and bustles on.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i feel like a jerk. i feel like a smiley face.}
<A>__{catch smiles, sharon frowns, but when an old man passes, she gives a small smile. the man lights up.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{mornin'.}
<A>__{catch looks at her. she tries to shrug it off, but can't quite hide her pleasure. now catch is pausing as a woman is walking her six year old daughter to their parked car. catch makes eye contact with the girl and does a goofy wave that makes her smile. sharon smiles, too. as the girl's mother is unlocking the car, the girl shyly looks back at catch for more fun. he does that quick finger trick trying to catch his own thumb, and the girl giggles but the mother is impatient.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{go on.}
<A>__{the girl gets in. the mother is about to close the door. she frowns, mean eyed.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{move your arm!}
<A>__{the girl slides in further, and the mother slams the door. the girl follows her mother with hurt eyes as she walks around to the driver's side. catch has paused to watch this, his eyes gentle on the girl. the mother is about to enter the car when she sees catch staring.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{what are you staring at?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{she feels bad 'cause you yelled at her.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{what?! who the hell do you think you are?}
<A>__{sharon is uncomfortable. catch persists, never flinching at the woman's anger.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{she just needs you to smile at her.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{it's none of your business!}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{why not smile at her? what's it cost?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{who the hell are you to talk to me?!}
<A>__{catch's anger is like flint in his eyes. it surprises sharon. she's upset by this.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{you're so damn impatient.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{get away from me!}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{you're so busy being pissed off, and time is going by.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{it's not her fault.}
<A>__{the woman gets into the car and slams the door.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i'm calling the police!}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{no. i'm calling the police.}
<P>__{(turns to sharon)}
<D>__{hey police.}
<A>__{the woman speeds her car away. sharon gets in catch's face.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{jesus christ, catch.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{maybe she'll think about it now.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you had no right to do that. god! you think you know everything?! who the hell are you, some expert on raising kids?! the neighborhood angel?! jesus!}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{no. no, i just... some people are walking around blind...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{that's not your problem!}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{don't tell me what my problem is!}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{okay, fine you tell me what it is!}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{maybe it's not my problem. maybe it's your problem. maybe you're going around blind.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{blind to what?!}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{blind to what's going on around you. blind to what people need. we're supposed to take care of each other. we're supposed to keep each other safe. that's the way it should be if you're not going around blind, like that woman...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{or like me, right? what about you? how come you can see?}
<A>__{that stops him, the darkness rising. he looks about, trying to contain it.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i think i will... walk the rest of the way on my own.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{yeah. fine.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i will call you later about the hiking.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i will be out.}
<A>__{she turns and walks away. he is still angry, but sorry to see her go.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{shar... wait. hey!}
<A>__{but she keeps walking, and he watches her walk away. then he walks on, upset, mad at himself, trying to pound through it, walking quickly. he is passing an alley, when he hears a crash. he looks in...}
