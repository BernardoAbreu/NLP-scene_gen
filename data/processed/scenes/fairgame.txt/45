<L>__{interior conference room, directorate of intelligence. day.}
<A>__{several analysts sit around a table, including the lead analyst, paul. two of them are the guys who were bad mouthing valerie. another is joe turner, a dough faced offical from winpac (weapons intelligence non proliferaton and control).}
<C>__{turner}
<P>__{(reads)}
<D>__{"in summer 2001 iraq sought to purchase 60,000 high alloy 7075 t4 aluminum tubes manufactured in china. the high spec of these tubes led us to conclude they were intended for the enrichment of uranium. in august 2001 j. turner.." that's me.. "flew to vienna, to meet with iaea scientists. mr. turner produced this report, aspects of which represents the cia's present position." i'm happy to take questions.}
<C>__{analyst}
<D>__{the inr concluded late last year that these tubes were probably for artillery use, and the doe agreed they exactly matched those used by iraq for artillery rockets.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{where are the tubes?}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{winpac has them. we've examined them. this is my pointerior none of you guys has even seen the tubes.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{i've seen them.}
<A>__{everyone looks at her.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{and when was that?}
<A>__{valerie looks up. slightly surprised by his tone.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{when i seized them last year in jordan. when i headed the covert team that intercepted them, bought back samples and delivered them to you guys at winpac.}
<A>__{a couple of the analysts try not to smile.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{so i take it you're not a nuclear expert. these tubes are an exact match for those developed by german scientist gernot zippe in the 50s.}
<A>__{valerie turns to her notes from her reading.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{you're right. i'm no nuclear expert. but dr. houston wood, at virginia u atomic facility is. he also knows dr zippe, who's 89 and lives in austria, and he told him that the wall thickness of the iraqi tubes was three or four times the thickness of his design.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{and the tubes are twice as long as zippe's design. in fact the only similarity between his tubes and the alumumium tubes is that they're made of aluminium.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{a metal that hasn't been used in}
<A>__{the chauvanist analysts share a look of respect for valerie. still turner doesn't give up.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{i went to vienna. canada. i've worked on this for months. they're centrifuges. fact.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so basically, they're your tubes and if we don't let you win you're going home.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{that's pathetic.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{joe. no one is saying you're wrong here. but if you're right, it's huge. so we ask the question. right? we have to ask the question.}
