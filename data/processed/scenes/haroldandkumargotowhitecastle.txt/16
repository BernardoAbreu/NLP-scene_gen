<L>__{interior apartment building (lobby) day}
<A>__{harold enters the building and walks over to maria. they give each other a friendly smile. we hear a "bing" sound, indicating the elevator has arrived. the doors open and harold and maria walk inside.}
<L>__{interior elevator}
<A>__{harold and maria are standing silently as the elevator goes up. eventually, harold gets the courage to speak...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{so maria, what's been going on?}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{oh, nothing. it's just been a long week. how about you?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{my week was great. work wasn't too bad. i caught up on some sleep. plus, the guy who works next to me decided to bathe for a change.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{oh wait, i meant the exact opposite of that. work sucked. i barely slept. and the guy next to me still smells like crap. but a man can dream, right?}
<A>__{maria laughs. harold's pleased that his joke worked.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{so what are you up to tonight?}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{actually, i'm probably gonna work out a little bit, clean up the apartment, and then go over to my boyfriend's place. he's cooking me a really nice dinner.}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{maria}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{oh wait, i meant the exact opposite of that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will actually probably just sit on my ass, eat a pint of hagaan daz, and watch blind date.}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(playful)}
<D>__{that sounds awful.}
<A>__{harold laughs, as does maria. they smile at each other...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{well, if you want some company, maybe you could sit on your ass at my place.}
<C>__{maria}
<P>__{(flirty)}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{we hear the "bing" of the elevator...}
