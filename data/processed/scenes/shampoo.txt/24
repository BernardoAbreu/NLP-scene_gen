<L>__{interior jackie's bedroom and bath day}
<A>__{which includes a sauna. jackie's got on a terry cloth robe. george has been wetting her hair in the basin. her terry cloth robe is bulky and obviously in the way.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{jill's coming with us.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{she's incredible...}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{she loves you, george.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yeah... i mean great.}
<A>__{george begins to cut. jackie winces a little. george notices it.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{getting my hair cut is always a little nerve wracking.}
<A>__{the cutting goes on. the bathroom is very close. george has begun to perspire a little as has jackie.}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{... i don't get it done often.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{whew.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's hot in here.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{it's the sauna, i keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yeah... wow.}
<A>__{george stops and takes off his shirt. he's wearing a purple t shirt underneath. he goes back to cutting. jackie's getting more and more edgy, partly because of george's proximity and partly because of her concern over what he's doing. george on the other hand is now less tentative, more focused on the job at hand.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{not too much, don't cut too much.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{jackie, would you argue with your doctor.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{the shrink? many times.}
<A>__{george stops and looks at her. both are perspiring freely now.}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{bernstein... seemed to think i hated men.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{do you? you still see him?}
<A>__{jackie tries to look at her hair in the mirror. george gently pulls her back.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(with some feeling)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{jackie doesn't answer.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{... he tried to... uh... make it with me.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{and what?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{did you?}
<A>__{jackie looks up slowly. george is still cutting, not looking directly at her.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it was after you, baby. after you.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(breathes deeply)}
<D>__{boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{no... lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.}
