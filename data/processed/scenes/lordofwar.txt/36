<L>__{exterior freighter ship. day.}
<A>__{we tilt up from the water to find yuri on the deck of a freighter, ploughing the ballpoint blue seas off the coast of colombia.}
<D>__{north of barranquilla, colombia 1989}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{operations like mine provided the only way for certain regimes to conduct a respectable war.}
<A>__{vitaly holds onto a railing trying to stave off seasickness, not helped by standing downwind from yuri's cigarette smoke.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{the freighter i was standing on carried 113 tons of weapons and ammunition for delivery to one of the poorest nations in latin america in direct contravention of half a dozen international arms embargoes.}
<A>__{yuri makes a call on his cell phone.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{to keep authorities in the dark, i often spoke in code. rocket launchers were "mothers", the rockets "children". assault rifles were "apples". the ak 47 was "the angel king".}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{the angel king will arrive tomorrow...hallelujah to you too.}
<A>__{yuri hangs up. his phone rings with an incoming call.}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yes?...slow the fuck down what do you mean, tipped off? they know where we are?! where are they?!}
<A>__{yuri grabs a pair of binoculars. on the horizon, a fast approaching speed boat interpol agents visible on the racer's deck.}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(hanging up)}
<D>__{forget it.}
<A>__{vitaly and the captain, also spying the customs boat, join yuri at the railing.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{do we run?}
<C>__{vitaly}
<D>__{we have to get out of here.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{no, no one's going anywhere.}
<P>__{(to the captain)}
<D>__{slow dead slow. buy me time.}
<A>__{yuri swings into action, frantically dials another number on his satellite cell phone.}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(barking an order to a crewman, referring to the panamanian flag)}
<D>__{get that fucking rag down!}
<A>__{the crewman hastily complies. yuri's call is answered.}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(trying not to sound too desperate)}
<D>__{it's yuri. i need another handle for this tub...something in our weight class.}
<P>__{(to an elderly latin painter, pointing to the stern)}
<D>__{you, over the side!}
<P>__{(the painter hesitates)}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{the terrified painter makes for the stern where he's hurriedly winched over. yuri returns to the phone call.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{yes, it's got to check out...you got a shorter name!...what? kono? how do you spell that?...k o n o. that's good!}
<A>__{he hangs up.}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(to the painter, already blacking out the name, kristol)}
<D>__{kono! k o n o.}
<A>__{the painter, nods nervously from his precarious perch, starts to painterior yuri sneaks another look through his binoculars. the customs boat is closing fast.}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(back into phone)}
<D>__{what are we flying?...dutch? later.}
<P>__{(hanging up, to vitaly)}
<D>__{vit, get me a dutch flag!}
<A>__{yuri checks the customs boat again.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{damn, they're hauling!}
<A>__{he checks the painter's progress.}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(agitated, grasping the line of the scaffold)}
<D>__{faster! or i send you in!}
<P>__{(checking the binoculars again)}
<D>__{faster...and better!}
<A>__{the painter's hand is shaking.}
<C>__{vitaly }
<P>__{(panicked)}
<D>__{yuri!}
<A>__{vitaly is frantically rummaging through a trunk containing dozens of national flags.}
<C>__{vitaly }
<D>__{i don't have dutch.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{vitaly}
<D>__{i've got belgium.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{what the fuck use is that?!}
<P>__{(panicked, gesturing to the stern)}
<D>__{he's painting a name registered in the fucking netherlands!}
<A>__{vitaly winces.}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(mind racing)}
<D>__{you got france?!}
<C>__{vitaly}
<P>__{(confused, finding the tricolor)}
<D>__{yes, why?}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{turn it on its side.}
<A>__{vitaly turns the flag sideways now a makeshift dutch flag. vitaly nods, impressed. yuri looks forward. the customs boat has almost reached the bow of the freighter. the flag is hoisted. the painter, barely completing the last "o" of "kono", is hauled back on deck.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{that's it! everybody look innocent now!}
<A>__{the crew resume their normal duties as the customs boat slows to a crawl itself, at close quarters with the freighter. the heavily armed interpol agents eyeball the rusted vessel. yuri focuses on the senior agent jack valentine. while the other agents wear sunglasses, long hair, tattoo or personalized uniform, valentine is completely by the book. his interpol windbreaker clean and zipped to the neck.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{they say every man has his price but not every man gets it. interpol agent, jack valentine, couldn't be bought, at least not with money. for jack, glory was the prize.}
<A>__{the customs boat ominously circles the freighter like a hungry shark.}
