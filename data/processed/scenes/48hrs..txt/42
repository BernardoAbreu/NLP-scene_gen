<L>__{exterior street chinatown night}
<A>__{neon signs with sino lettering.}
<B>__{cates and hammond}
<A>__{walk down the street, spot a shop with a window display of tools. look up at the darkened apartment windows. they walk to the end of the block.}
<B>__{alley}
<A>__{stairwells lead to each apartment above the shops. cates and hammond move along the buildings... arrive at the back of the hardware store. quietly, they start to ascend the stairs.}
<B>__{stairwell}
<A>__{the metal steps extend onto a platform by the back door. cates leans over the railings to look through the adjacent window. between the drawn curtains, a flickering glimmer from a tv set. on the tube, various poses from stridently exercising women.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{what the shit is that?}
<A>__{looks again. a female form passes by, goes out of the room.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{there.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{must be billy's girl.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{come on.}
<B>__{doorway}
<A>__{cates gestures to the door lock. hammond fiddles with it for several moments. the door swings open. they step into a darkened room.}
<B>__{apartment}
<A>__{cates takes the .38 from his pocket. he stops near the open bedroom doorway. he looks at hammond and then both men step quickly into the room.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{police! nobody move!}
<A>__{hammond reaches for the light switch. takes a heavy blow. slumps against the door. a woman's voice screams out.}
<C>__{cates}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{stay where you are!}
<A>__{the light goes on. cates' gun points at a young woman (casey) in a flimsy dressing gown. saturday night special held between her palms, police style... a second woman (sally) stands beside hammond at the light switch. larger and slightly older than the first, she wears a man's shirt. holds a baseball bat in her right hand.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{you better drop it or he's gonna get another one.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{hey, talk to here jack. i don't feel like gettin' number two along side of the head.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i said police. now drop the goddamn gun.}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{don't give me that police shit. you drop it.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{okay, look, don't shoot. i'm just reachin' for my badge.}
<A>__{cates takes out his badge shows it to casey.}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{i don't like this bullshit. i've seen fake badges before.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i will tell you something lady, this guy is a real nervous cop he's just liable to pull the trigger.}
<A>__{cates takes two steps toward casey...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{naw, i'm the calm type. i know you don't want me to shoot you, and i know that you don't want to shoot me.}
<A>__{he takes two more steps toward her.}
<C>__{cates}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{shooting a cop puts you away for a long time.}
<A>__{holds out his hand.}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{you assholes better be real.}
<A>__{she hands cates the gun. sally prods hammond with the baseball bat.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{just wait a goddamn second here, let's see your badge...}
<A>__{he snatches the bat out of her hands.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{don't have one.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i knew it. call the cops.}
<A>__{casey walks over to the phone.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{tell them it's cates, detective 31st district. then put your clothes on. if you don't answer some questions i'm taking both your asses in.}
<A>__{after a moment, casey puts down the phone.}
<C>__{cates}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now, let's cut out the crap, which one of you sees billy bear?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{none of your business, cop. the son of a bitch isn't here, and he isn't coming back.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{you can do better than that.}
<A>__{turns to casey.}
<C>__{cates}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{how about it?}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{i used to go with him...i don't know where the hell he is. i haven't seen him for two weeks. and i don't think i will. he owes me money...}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{he's a goddamn lowlife, the way he treated her.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{sounds like a real stormy romance.}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{i don't much care what it sounds like to you, cop. all i know is that i went a few laps around the track with him and i ended up with nothin' but the short end of the stick.}
<A>__{cates looks over at hammond.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{let's go.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{wait a minute. maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us. how about it? i been nearly three years in prison and...}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{fuck off.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{come on...}
<A>__{hannond starts for the door with cates.}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{if you find that bastard, billy, tell him to stay out of my life. i don't need any more of his macho bullshit.}
