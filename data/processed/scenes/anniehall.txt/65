<B>__{woman on the street}
<D>__{never something you do. that's how people are. love fades.}

<D>__{you you look like a really happy couple. uh, uh ... are you?}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{alvy}

<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{uh, i'm very shallow and empty and i have no ideas and nothing interesting to say.}
<C>__{young man}

<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{oh, well, thanks very much for talking to me.}
<A>__{he continues to walk past some other passersby and moves into the street. a mounted policeman comes by and stops near him. alvy looks at the horse, as if to speak.}
<D>__{alvy's voice over you know, even as a kid i always went for the wrong women. i think that's my problem. when my mother took me to see snow white, everyone fell in love with snow white. i immediately fell for the wicked queen.}
<A>__{the scene dissolves into a sequence from the animated snow white and the seven dwarfs. the wicked queen, resembling annie, sits in the palace before her mirror. alvy, as a cartoon figure, sits beside her, arms crossed in front of him.}
<C>__{wicked queen}
<D>__{we never have any fun anymore.}
<C>__{cartoon figure alvy}
<D>__{how can you say that?}
<C>__{wicked queen}
<D>__{why not? you're always leaning on me to improve myself.}
<C>__{cartoon figure alvy}
<D>__{you're just upset. you must be getting your period.}
<C>__{wicked queen}
<D>__{i don't get a period! i'm a cartoon character. can't i be upset once in a while?}
<A>__{rob, as a cartoon figure, enters and sits down on the other side of the wicked queen.}
<C>__{cartoon figure rob}
<D>__{max, will you forget about annie? i know lots of women you can date.}
<C>__{cartoon figure alvy}
<D>__{i don't wanna go out with any other women.}
<C>__{cartoon figure rob}
<D>__{max, have i got a girl for you. you are going to love her. she's a reporter }
<A>__{the cartoon figures of alvy and rob walk past the wicked queen; the screen dissolves into the interior of a concert ball. rob's voice carries over from the cartoon scene as the screen shows alvy with the female reporter. it's very crowded, noisy; policeman and reporters are everywhere. alvy stands with his hands in his pockets, watching the commotion.}
<D>__{cartoon figure rob's voice over for rolling stone.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<D>__{i think there are more people here to see the maharishi than there were to see the dylan concert. i covered the dylan concert ... which gave me chills. especially when he sang "she takes just like a woman and she makes love just like a woman yes, she does and she aches just like a woman but she breaks just like a little girl."}
<P>__{(they move toward the aisles as}
<D>__{a guard holds up his hands to stop}
<P>__{them)}
<D>__{up to that i guess the most charismatic event i covered was mick's birthday when the stones played madison square garden.}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{man, that's great. that's just great.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{you catch dylan?}

<D>__{me? no, no. i i couldn't make it that ni my my raccoon had hepatitis.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{you have a raccoon?}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{tsch, a few.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{the only word for this is trans plendid. it's trans plendid.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{i can think of another word.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{he's god! i mean, this man is god! he's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{really? it must be a tremendous hem.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{i'm a rosicrucian myself.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{are you?}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{i can't get with any religion that advertises in popular mechanics. look }
<P>__{(the maharisbi, a small, chunky}
<D>__{man, walks out of the men's room, huge bodyguards flanking him while}
<P>__{policemen bold back the crowds)}
<D>__{there's god coming outta the men's room.}
