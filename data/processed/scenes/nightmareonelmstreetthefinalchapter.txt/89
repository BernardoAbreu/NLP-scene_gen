<A>__{the intensity of karen's quest increases as she yanks open cabinets and tosses plates to the floor. still nothing.}
<L>__{interior elm street house stairs}
<A>__{karen runs up them, a girl with a mission.}
<L>__{interior elm street house master bedroom}
<A>__{karen flings the door open. nothing but a bed and a set of drawers. no hint as to the occupant's lives. she doesn't bother ransacking this one and goes on to:}
<L>__{interior elm street house freddy's bedroom}
<A>__{jackpot. karen stares through the open door at a child's room, a very twisted child's room. she slowly walks in. a bed, a desk, a dresser. there's a jack in a box with its head torn off. a disemboweled teddy bear. white puffy guts hanging out of it. a clown doll with its face caved in. a hanging mobile made of strange bent shapes. and a pile of more than dirty clothes. karen goes over to the pile and picks through it with her toe. a small pair of pants, about the right size for an eight year old. a black pair of shoes. and a little sweater, a red and green striped sweater. karen goes over to the desk. there is stack of drawings on it a child's drawings. on one of them it looks like someone was practicing writing their name. freddy unnerwood, freddy underwud, freddy underwood over and over again. until the final attempt has the last name angrily crossed out, replaced underneath by a hastily scrawled krueger!!! another piece of paper: a set of human stick figures. a small one is labeled freddy. the large one is labeled daddy. the daddy figure is depicted hitting the freddy figure. there are more drawings, all of them violent, the large figure beating away at the small one. suddenly a creaking. karen jumps. hides behind a bookshelf. she's nervously trying to figure out what to do when a framed picture catches her attention on the shelf. it's a picture of a tall, dark man and a little boy. karen reaches out to grab the picture, but accidentally knocks over a glass mug with a crash. footsteps can now be heard tromping up the stairs. someone's coming and karen's on the edge of panic. she looks around and finds an old baseball bat. she grabs it and runs to the side of the doorway as the footsteps approach down the hallway. karen raises the bat. and jacob appears. karen pulls back with the bat as jacob jumps away from her.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{jacob! you scared the shit out of me!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{the feeling is mutual.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{where are the dream police?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i told them to look for you. what are you doing here? don't you know what this place is?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i do now. look what i found.}
<A>__{she starts to drag him over to the desk of drawings.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you've got to get out of here.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{wait. you have to see this.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you don't understand. the police can't kill freddy. they literally chopped each other to pieces and he's still alive! now i'm supposed to figure out how to get rid of him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{but i think i found the answer. shut up for a second and look at these.}
<A>__{she starts showing him the scrawlings.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{okay, so he's a bad artist.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no! you told me krueger's mother committed suicide and no one knows who his father was, right?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{freddy's been pushing all our buttons with our pasts. these are his past. don't you get it? he was a foster child, too!}
<A>__{she walks over to the bookshelf and grabs the picture of little freddy and freddy's foster father.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{someone had to have taken care of him. this guy...he was freddy's father. those drawings...they were freddy's childhood. this house...it's where it all happened.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{but in reality freddy hasn't lived here for decades.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{like you tried to tell me once before, this is a dream. who knows why this is all here.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{all evils from all times in history...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{and isn't this where it all started in springwood? on elm street?}
<A>__{jacob thinks for a second. it's all starting to make sense.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{but what does this do for us?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{there's got to be a way to use it against him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{okay, but we're not going to stand around here to figure out how. it's too dangerous.}
<A>__{he grabs her hand and pulls her towards her door.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{let's get out of this house.}
<A>__{they head out to}
<B>__{upstairs hallway}
<A>__{and blade cop is standing in the middle of the corridor. the two teenagers stop.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{thank god. freddy's going to show up any minute.}
<A>__{kachink! a knife shoots out of blade's right hand, ready for action. (but wait a minute, her uniform isn't ripped anymore...) karen and jacob make their way to the stairs. he turns to blade.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{where are the others?}
<A>__{blade walks up to him and stands there. then jams her knife into jacob's gut. karen screams. jacob chokes. blade cop shoves the knife in further until it juts out of jacob's back. she turns. then becomes freddy.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{time to join your mommy.}
<A>__{krueger yanks his finger blades out and jacob's limp body falls at karen's feet. karen shrieks and cries, dropping to her knees to hold him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no no no no no no no...jacob...}
<A>__{he looks up at her, slowly dying. she strokes his forehead while freddy laughs at the sentiment.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{young love...ha!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{karen...dream...powers....}
<A>__{and jacob is gone. karen sobs, so torn apart that she is ignoring the incredible danger above her. but not for long. krueger grabs karen by the neck.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{it's past your bedtime, young lady.}
<A>__{and he starts to drag her, kicking and screaming, her body scraping across the floor towards the}
<B>__{master bedroom}
<A>__{freddy drags karen in and tosses her across the room. she lands with a thud on the bed. he saunters over to her and climbs up on the bed next to her. gets on top. karen yells and hits him uselessly with her fists and it's horrible because there he is, pressing down on her, right in her face, mounting her as if he's going to rape her.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{aw, sweetheart. this won't hurt a bit.}
<A>__{she screams as he presses even harder.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{come on. be daddy's little girl.}
<A>__{and the last three words of that sentence seem to echo through the room, swirling around karen. daddy's little girl. "daddy's little girl." karen twists her head away. and freddy's become karen's father. he looks down on her with a lecherous grin.}
<C>__{karen's father}
<D>__{that's my baby. that's daddy's little girl.}
<A>__{karen stops struggling. the realization grows on her face with the resurfacing memory.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{oh no...}
<C>__{karen's father}
<P>__{(freddy's voice)}
<D>__{now do you remember?}
<A>__{she does. and she has an answer for him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're not my father.}
<C>__{karen's father}
<D>__{but we're going to have the same fun!}
<A>__{karen stares at him defiantly. and a hand grabs karen's father, and yanks him away. we pull back. karen's mother is next to the bed. furious.}
<C>__{karen's mother}
<D>__{that's enough!}
<A>__{and she slaps karen's father. he stands up, slugs her across the jaw. she tumbles back. karen sits up.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{mommy, no!}
<A>__{karen's mother gets up, a defiant look just like karen's on her face.}
<C>__{karen's mother}
<D>__{you're never going to touch her again!}
<C>__{karen's father}
<D>__{i will touch what i want!}
<A>__{bap! he strikes her again, sending her right out the door. he follows her. karen stands up and runs after them.}
<B>__{in the hallway}
<A>__{crack! the man hits the woman down to the floor. karen's mother stands up, just taking it. she's at the top of the stairs. karen's father swings his arm back, and karen jumps on him. he shrugs her away violently.}
<B>__{with karen}
<A>__{as she hits the ground and the wall next to jacob's body. she looks up.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{and karen's father is now freddy again. he swings his fist. smack! karen's mother reels from the hit, falls backwards. karen jumps up to try and help her, reaching past freddy. but it's too late. karen's mother tumbles down the stairs, head hitting, bones cracking, disappearing into darkness. freddy grabs karen by the neck and lifts her. dangles her over the top of the steps.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{be honored, bitch. you're the last soul i need.}
<A>__{and jacob rises up behind krueger. grabs him. freddy drops karen. she hits hard and rolls down the steps as freddy turns, his knives swinging out and slamming jacob's gut one more time, impaling him against the wall. jacob gasps out his final breath.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i will be back...}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{i will be waiting.}
<A>__{freddy pulls his blades out of jacob and the wall. the boy's body hits the floor for the last time. freddy turns back to the stairs and looks down them.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{where's my little pumpkin?}
<A>__{he strolls down the steps.}
<B>__{downstairs hallway}
<A>__{freddy walks down and no one's there. karen's mom was just an illusion, but karen herself, dead or alive, is nowhere to be seen.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{play time is over, bitch.}
<A>__{he walks down the hallway. eyes darting. until a booming voice is heard from the kitchen.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{frederick!}
<A>__{freddy cocks his head and frowns.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{frederick! what have you done?}
<A>__{and, amazingly, a look of fear crosses krueger's face. something about that voice has struck terror in the heart of the creature that fears nobody. krueger turns to the kitchen door. a man steps out of the shadows, a big muscular man with a horrifying look in his eyes. a man we've seen somewhere before in a picture. it's freddy's foster father mr. underwood. and he looks pissed beyond belief. freddy shrinks back, eyes widening.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{daddy?}
<C>__{mr. underwood}
<D>__{don't you "daddy" me!}
<A>__{mr. underwood raises his arm and smacks freddy across the skull. krueger tumbles back into the hallway. freddy scrambles to his feet. shakes with dread. looks like a scared little boy. mr. underwood advances on him.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{no, daddy. please...}
<A>__{freddy turns and bolts for the front door. he flings it open. power cop stands in his way and shoves freddy back back in front of his foster father. punch a vicious blow from underwood sends krueger into}
<B>__{the living room}
<A>__{where freddy falls over a couch. underwood stomps into the room. krueger scrambles up and heads for the archway leading into the dining room. blade cop blocks the escape. the ripped flap of her uniform proving she's the real one. she kicks freddy back and into underwood's hands. the man picks up krueger and hits him again. and again. and again.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{stop. you're hurting me. stop.}
<A>__{freddy wriggles away and opens a window. sound cop fills the window, cutting him off. pushes him back inside. mr. underwood grabs krueger and slaps him over and over. slugs him. gives the beating he's got coming to him. and freddy moans and yells like a blubbering child. shrinks into a corner but is yanked out for more pummeling. power cop stands at the exit to the hallway. blade cop continues to obstruct the dining room arch. sound cop steps through the window and stands in front of it. the dream police just stare in silence. it's not a street fight, not a punching match. just a ruthless thrashing that would be hard to watch if it weren't for the fact that we are all cheering because no one in history has ever deserved it more. underwood stops the whipping and stands over krueger who is lying on the ground whimpering, pleading for mercy.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{why, daddy? what did i do?}
<C>__{mr. underwood}
<D>__{you took some things that don't belong to you!}
<A>__{and with that, underwood brings his fist down and jams it into freddy's stomach. right through it. shoving it into his very body. freddy screams. underwood violently pulls his fist out and there's something in it. a shimmering flowing thing. crackling with unworldly light. it's a soul. it's wesley's soul. underwood flings his arm out and lets go. wesley's soul flies into thin air and dissipates. krueger's father brings his hand down again and rips out gina's soul. again. jacob's soul. freddy opens his mouth and shrieks. as underwood raises his arms and begins to sparkle. flashes of light bounce around his body. he's changing. and something's happening to freddy's too. steam is rising from the creature. his feet are starting to flatten as he lays on the ground and black goo oozes from his pores. he's melting. and still screaming as he watches his foster father's image turn into: karen. an aura of light vanishes around her body as she lowers her arms with a victorious yet sad look on her face. freddy dies. a look of horrified realization burns in krueger's eyes as he sees karen and continues to scream inhumanly. his body dissolves, all of it liquefying into black slime. gone. just a bubbling black puddle of gunk is left. his shriek echoes through the room and everywhere else. then the gunk grows and changes into a dark cloud that begins to expand. power cop runs up, grabs karen and yells.}
<C>__{power cop}
<D>__{we gotta get outta here!}
<A>__{karen, almost mesmerized by the black cloud spreading in front of her, stumbles away with power cop.}
