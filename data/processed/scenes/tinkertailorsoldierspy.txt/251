<A>__{he stops still inside his doorway. the little figure on the console table is in the wrong position. smiley puts his hand on it, but doesn't right it, listening to something from somewhere inside the house. a faint movement. through the half open kitchen door we catch a glimpse of a woman beyond. ann is back. smiley stands with his back to us, still in his coat, staring through the door at his wife beyond. something of a vermeer in the image. he's absorbing the different atmosphere home. deciding whether to go in. or not. suddenly we hear music julio iglesias, singing a disco version of la mer very seventies.}
