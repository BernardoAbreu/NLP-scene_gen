<L>__{exterior tribal police shooting range dawn}
<A>__{crow horse guns in, sliding in dirt up to the run down, low budget shooting range six plastic milk jugs on sticks, jammed in the mud. a moment later, the van hammers in. parks. ray gets out. he's removed his hat so as not to invite any crap from crow horse.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{don't be mad. that was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i see. forgive my cultural ignorance.}
<A>__{ray executes a hard, slapping, "up your ass" gesture.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{have a nice day.}
<A>__{crow horse bursts into laughter in his raspy, staccato laugh. he walks off a few steps, picks up a spent shell and pitches it. his laughter simmers and he gets serious.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{jimmy didn't do it, ray. i checked it out. you can stop taggin' my sister.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{she's your sister?}
<C>__{ray and crow horse}
<D>__{spiritual sister.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{gotchya. we just nailed a genetic match between the eagle feather left at the murder site and one in jimmy's medicine bundle. it came from a white eagle. same bird.}
<A>__{crow horse fingers an eagle feather that hangs from his hat band.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{so did this one. wambli is a rare and sacred creature. when someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. we share everything. a lot of power in the eagle feathers. but you think that's bullshit too, don't }
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(ala crow horse)}
<D>__{ leo fast elk was sitting in the outhouse at maisy blue legs when a car pulled into the yard. he came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was jimmy. he tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. he started running for the open grass. with the car moving, jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim missed once, hitting the shitter fired again, and severed leo's spine. leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. and some chicken feed. stale chicken feed with four days mold.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{electromagnetic printing.}
<A>__{crow horse stares, a little surprised.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{was te. 'cept for one thing. jimmy looks twice was nowhere near there. ya see, when jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near elk mountain.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i don't see the connection.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{the connection is, it did a head number on him. he's petrified of cars. won't drive. i've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. he rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. the man that shot leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.}
<A>__{ray absorbs this with great interest.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that's not solid.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{you want solid? that one, single, print he left in the badlands the one the fbi missed and then stepped all over it belongs to a man who walks heels first. like a white man. jimmy has a serious ind'n walk ball of the foot first. the man who murdered leo walked like a wasi'cu.}
<A>__{ray lets a pent up sigh escape.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you're saying a white guy did it...}
<A>__{crow horse chews this over, unable to hide a nagging frustration. he shakes his head.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{when leo was dumped out there in the badlands, he was dropped on his back. our man made an effort to turn him over, onto his face. it's an old ind'n belief that if a dead man is turned face down, his spirit won't leave. and in the killer's case, it won't come back and jump all over his shit. that's an ind'n thing a white man wouldn't know.}
<A>__{the two of them stand there, thinking this over. ray takes out his notebook and starts writing. crow horse walks away, turns to face the propped up targets.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{and that's the way it is. write it down.}
<A>__{to punctuate, crow horse slaps leather, draws his .38, and begins blasting at the milk bottles. he hits the bank. a tree. one of the posts. but not a single target. when he is done, he looks over his gun, disappointed. starts reloading. ray starts laughing, looking at the missed targets}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{you laugh all you want, breed. sunset tonight, i get my man.}
<A>__{ray looks at crow horse, sees that he's serious, and follows him toward his motorcycle.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{alright, crow horse. i'm listening. i'm listening to the trees, to the stones. who is it?}
<A>__{crow horse turns toward ray, and creates a long dramatic pause.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{damned if i know.}
<A>__{and he hauls his bulk onto his motorbike.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{but the old one. he did a yuwipi ceremony last night.}
<A>__{crow horse winks at ray as he slams the kickstart. to no avail.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{the old man? he's gonna tell you who killed leo?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{go catch jimmy, ray. really. he's gettin' away. go ahead, go get him. i'm late.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hey. hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{grandpa traded with me.}
<P>__{(flips the bird)}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{and crow horse nails his kick start. the bike roars alive and the indian works the throttle hard, leaving gravel and black exhaust. ray stands there, drifting between logic and instinct. he looks at his watch, then starts at a slow, thoughtful shuffle toward his car.}
