<A>__{close shot scobie. the dead man's eyes are open, his jaw hanging, his head lying crazily on the pillow. camera pulls back to show him lying in bed, dressed in his pajamas. camera whirls for a tight close shot of a maid, her eyes widening as the realization that the man is dead strikes her. then she screams.}

<D>__{none of you will be permitted to leave paris until this matter is cleared up. only i warn you i will be watching. we use the guillotine in this country i have always suspected that the blade coming down causes no more than a slight tickling sensation on the back of the neck. it is only a guess, of course i hope none of you ever finds out for certain.}
