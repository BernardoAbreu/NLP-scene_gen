<A>__{bill builds, lets the record spin, then pops the kill button. the tune fades in a distorted way as he start stops start stops it, forcing the sound backwards and forwards... ...as maurice twiddles dials and distorts it all further it's spooky, but way funky. new angle the black dog is now in the house too. walking through the throbbing crowd, making a path right through them, most of the dancers paying it no mind, it's just another part of the trippy scene. or do they even see it? we can't tell. closer angle on the dog and it's single minded concentration. staring straight ahead as it moves through the crowd towards maurice, who for a second, notices the dog coming but making nothing of it. reverse the dog's pov what it's staring at. bones' old ring on maurice's finger. new angle maurice's pov when he looks back, he sees not a dog, but a beautiful black woman, a dark lady, who only has eyes for him. dancing seductively, drawing a crowd as she moves, she stares straight ahead at maurice. maurice's joint droops from the corner of his mouth as he realizes "yes!", this world class beauty is most definitely flirting with him. the dark lady's still throwing him deep looks as she dances off the floor and then disappears up the stairs, making maurice lean into bill.}
