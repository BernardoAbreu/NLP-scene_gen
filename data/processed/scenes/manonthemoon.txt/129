<L>__{interior mid south coliseum later that night}
<A>__{ding! the bell rings. foxy comes out, ready to brawl. but andy remains in his corner, running down the clock. he nonchalantly peels off his robe. foxy dances around impatiently. andy casually removes a towel from his neck. people boo. still stalling, andy then takes off his watch. people scream so furiously they're red faced. andy is tormenting them. a tattooed guy jumps up.}
<C>__{tattooed guy}
<D>__{are you scared???}
<A>__{andy sneers. he cracks his knuckles, finally walks over... and commences a windmill. absurdly, he spins his arms around and around, daring foxy to get near him. she rolls her eyes and waits. the ref jumps out of the way. a minute has counted down. finally, andy stops and the real wrestling begins. foxy lunges at him and immediately goes for a choke hold. the crowd cheers, relieved. lawler motions signals. foxy yanks but andy jerks away. andy is intrigued. she's coming to play! andy gestures to the ref and points up. the ref looks away and andy slaps foxy. the crowd furiously jeers. the ref spins around, and andy shrugs innocence. he then runs at foxy and theatrically pushes her into the ropes. she bounces off, stumbles back and andy drops to his knees. she trips over him and hits the mat. andy aggressively jumps onto foxy's shoulders and pins her. the ref counts: one! two! three! ding!! it's over. but andy stays on her, shaking his ass, leering rudely. jerry lawler yells from the corner.}
<C>__{lawler}
<D>__{alright, you won. get off her!}
<A>__{andy remains, flapping his arms like a chicken. the booing grows. louder. more emotional.}
<C>__{angry voices}
<D>__{jerry, help her! get in there! do something!}
<A>__{lawler hesitates then suddenly climbs in the ring and lifts andy off! lawler angrily pushes andy down. andy is flabbergasted.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{w what are you doing? i don't fight men!}
<A>__{lawler snickers and walks away. completely overreacting, andy grabs the mike.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{i'm gonna sue you!}
<P>__{(he starts ranting berserkly)}
<D>__{let me tell you something, lawler! i am not a hick i'm a national tv star! and i don't like a dumb cracker pushing me around in the ring! i never agreed to wrestle you! so you know what i'm gonna do???}
<P>__{(seething)}
<D>__{i'm gonna hire a lawyer to sue you for every cent you've got! this was assault and battery! in a court of law, i'm gonna kick your southern fried rump!!!}
<A>__{lawler snatches the mike and bellows.}
<C>__{lawler}
<D>__{yeah?! well i got news for you, andy kaufman! wrestling is a serious sport to me! i don't like anyone makin' fun of it, and i hate anyone insultin' the south! so we can settle this two ways: we can go to court... or you can get in the ring with a man, and wrestle for real!}
<A>__{andy watches, fuming. he is infuriated.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{he can't get away with this.}
<P>__{(to lawler)}
<D>__{you! you think i'm chicken?!}
<A>__{andy grabs back the mike. he sticks his face in shocked lawler's.}

<D>__{you wanna "wraaastle" me?! you wanna "wraaastle" me??? okay, lawler let's rumble! yeah, i've only wrestled women, but they were bigger than you! in fact, they're probably smarter than you, 'cause you're from "maaamphis, taaanassee!"}
<P>__{(back to his regular}
<D>__{voice, he points at}
<P>__{his head)}
<D>__{i'm from hollywood. i have the brains. that's how i win. and mr. lawler, i'm gonna make you cry "mama!"}
