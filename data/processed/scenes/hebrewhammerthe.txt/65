<L>__{exterior alley day}
<A>__{we see a non descript door in the middle of a brick wall. two turnstiles stand directly in front of the door. we can hear the muffled sounds of the gospel version of "let my people go." scribbled on the wall is the graffiti phrase, "hanukkah now!" the door opens, and the obnoxiously loud music spills out into the street. the hammer and esther exit, close the door, and push their way past the turnstiles into the alley.}

<D>__{tickets please.}
<A>__{the two hand the carnival worker their tickets.}
<C>__{carnival worker }
<D>__{thanks for riding the underground jewish railroad. if you plan on returning today, please make sure to get you hands stamped before you leave the alley.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{nah, we're kosher. thanks though.}
<A>__{the two walk past him. esther turns to the hammer.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{so, now what?}
<C>__{hammer}
