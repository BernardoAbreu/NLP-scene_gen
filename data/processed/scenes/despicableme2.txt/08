<A>__{lucy tries to drag gru to her car, but he's too heavy.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{man. ugh. large...person.}
<A>__{she gets an idea. lucy gets into her car. in the background, we see gru begin to come to, but he is struck by lucy's car as she pulls back and is knocked out again.}
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{oh...sorry!}
<A>__{closer now, lucy gets out and stuffs his body into the trunk. just then tom and stuart come out of gru's garage and see their boss being loaded in. lucy struggles to close the trunk.}
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{get...in...there...you...big...man!}
<A>__{slam! lucy finally slams the trunk then quickly gets into the vehicle. tom and stuart exchange horrified looks.}
<C>__{tom and stuart}
<D>__{boss!}
<A>__{they take off running after the car as it pulls away, running as fast as their tiny legs will carry them. they get right behind it and tom leaps up onto the trunk. he reaches his hand out to stuart, who is falling behind.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{koom ey lah!}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{koom ey lah! koom ey lah!}
<A>__{stuart leaps for the bumper and tom catches him by his overall straps. tom holds on tight as stuart dangles from the back of the car, his overall straps stretching way out.}
<C>__{stuart }
<D>__{aaaaaaiiieeeaaaiiieeeaaaah!}
<A>__{as lucy turns a corner, he slams into some garbage cans and ends up skiing behind the car in a cardboard box. now in the box, stuart continues to ride behind the car, and even starts to get the hang of that, too. he waves at tom, and tom waves back.}
<C>__{stuart }
<D>__{woooo!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{ooooh!}
<A>__{all is good until they go past a clothesline and a sheet gets stuck on stuart. the sheet forms a parasail which lifts stuart up into the air. he strikes a superman flying pose. then a flock of geese fly toward him and one actually slams into his face.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{quack quack!}
<A>__{it squawks at him as it flies off. lucy spots the commotion in her side view mirror and slams on the brakes. screech! both minions fly forward }
