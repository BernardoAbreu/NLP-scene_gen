<A>__{drew walks zowie from the house with a dish of dog food. as they pass the rabbit dens, zowie alters his path. drew gets a handful of his collar and pulls him back. across the yard is an enclosed dog run. twenty feet long by ten feet wide. drew puts zowie inside with the dog food. drew strokes zowie's mane affectionately, then backs away, closing the wood framed door to the dog run.}
