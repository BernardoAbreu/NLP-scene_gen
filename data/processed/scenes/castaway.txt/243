<D>__{i'm so tired, my mind is on the blink...}
<A>__{he pulls in the loose sea anchor rope, which is covered with barnacles. he scrapes the barnacle off the rope into the water jug, then sips it. the sun is setting, huge rays shoot out across the sky. out of the empty ocean the dorados suddenly appear, leaping flashes of silver right by the raft. one dorado swims right by the raft, broadside. chuck looks at it, uncomprehending. then slowly reaches for his spear.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{what? are you sacrificing yourself for me?}
<A>__{carefully he comes to his feet, then shoots the spear into the fish. flapping and struggling, it lands on the deck. chuck pounces on it.}
