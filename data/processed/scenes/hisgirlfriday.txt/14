<L>__{interior walter burns' office med. shot}
<A>__{the doctor has gone. burns is adjusting his shirt. bruce is sitting at the desk.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i don't know. this makes me feel funny.}
<B>__{two shot}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{why shouldn't i make hildy my beneficiary? i've got nobody else to leave it to.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i feel i ought to take care of her.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{well, you'll take care of her. after all, if that doctor's right, i'm going to live for a long time yet. look, bruce, this is a debt of honor. i was a very bad husband: hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. she had it coming to her, but she was too independent.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{well, i'm independent, too.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{figure it this way: i ought to be good for twenty five years. by that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. but suppose you haven't made good don't you think hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{well, of course, if you put it that way.}
<C>__{burns}
<P>__{(everything he has on the ball)}
<D>__{and remember this, bruce! i love her, too.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i'm beginning to realize that.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{and the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till i've passed on. maybe she'll think kindly of me after i'm gone.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(a lump in his throat)}
<D>__{gee, you almost make me feel like a heel coming between you.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{no, bruce, you didn't come between us. it was all over for her before you came on the scene. for me it'll never be over.}
<A>__{he turns away, wipes his eyes, and sneaks a glance to see how that goes over. it goes over big bruce hurriedly wipes a tear away.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{as duffy comes into the room. he advances toward the desk.}
<C>__{duffy}
<P>__{(placing check on desk)}
<D>__{here's that certified check, walter.}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{i drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 i'm a ruined man!}
<C>__{burns}
<P>__{(also sotto voce)}
<D>__{don't worry, duffy, you'll have it back by five.}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{thanks, duffy. stick around.}
<P>__{(picking up check he rises)}
<A>__{he walks over to bruce.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{well, bruce, here you are certified and everything.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(also rising)}
<D>__{certified! i'm afraid hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.}
<B>__{closeup duffy}
<A>__{he reacts to this sweetly solemn thought.}
<B>__{burns and bruce}
<A>__{camera follows them as burns walks bruce toward door, his arm around him.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{well, she'll know some day.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{that's all i ask. oh, wait a minute.}
<A>__{he releases bruce, runs back and gets umbrella and brings it to him.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{don't want to forget this, you know. might start to rain again.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{thanks. i will phone hildy right away to get that story.}
<A>__{they are at the door. burns opens the door for bruce.}
<B>__{shot featuring louis}
<A>__{louis is sitting at a desk, apparently engrossed in a newspaper. he is all alert, however. bruce and burns come into the scene talking.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{well, anyway, i know hildy's getting a good man.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{thanks a lot.}
<A>__{they pass louis. he looks up.}
