<A>__{he hugs krod and vaults them across. krod clings and struggles, then yelps x takks hear and scan the pinnacle and moat edges. on top of the pinnacle, rush and krod hunker. flynn signals from the far side "stay down!" x takks patrol below, pausing to gaze up. atop the pinnacle, krod's circuits energy zap with fear. rush holds him down. at last, x takks move on. rush extends his light pole to the moat floor vaults to the far side with krod. krod stabilizes, looks around.}
