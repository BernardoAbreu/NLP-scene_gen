<A>__{the same little league field that frank circled on his harley yesterday, october 10, 1969. and the same field at which john sat in the stands drinking last night, october 10, 1998. we are in the 9th inning of a friendly softball game between the local cops and firemen. a lot of nypd and fdny t shirts, sweats and caps. plenty of mets stuff, too. having made the catch, frank coolly pulls the ball from his mitt as he starts running toward the infield diamond. tagging up at 3rd, sorely tempted to try for home is satch deleon, 30, nypd detective. satch feints for the plate, frank feints the throw. for a maddening, gleeful moment, frank has satch caught between 3rd and home. in the stands, johnny sullivan, marge hersch and the families of the other ballplayers scream for whomever they want to win this game of chicken. on the sidelines, johnny, gordo and the other kids serving as batboys and waterboys, jump around in anticipation. at home, butch foster stations himself to take the throw. suddenly, satch fakes to 3rd, then bolts for home. frank pegs it to butch, who tags the sliding satch. game over.}
