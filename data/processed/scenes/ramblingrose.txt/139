<A>__{a shot of a coolly angry mother in the kitchen. it is late morning. as she talks the camera pulls back to show a sheepish buddy standing "on the carpet before her. the other children, doll and waski, are seated at the kitchen table having hamburgers for lunch. they are happily smiling with schadenfreude amusement at their brother's discomfiture.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{brother, when i have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.}

<D>__{and you weren't reading huckleberry finn. i looked and its not in your room. now what were you doing?}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(sheepish)}
<D>__{mother, i have to tell the truth. i wasn't reading huckleberry finn, i was reading one of those little dirty comic books.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{oh, brother, i am so disappointed in you. you mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image.}
<C>__{brother}
<P>__{(hangs head)}
<D>__{they're filthy, mother.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.}
<C>__{brother}
<D>__{i know, mother.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{but we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.}
<C>__{brother}
<D>__{i am in awe of it, mother.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. get the castor oil.}
<C>__{brother}
<P>__{(winces, as doll and waski happily smile)}
<D>__{oh, mother, not the castor oil.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{this isn't punishment, i don't believe in punishment. it's for your health. obviously you're sick if you can act like that.}
<A>__{as she talks, buddy reluctantly gets a bottle of castor oil and a tablespoon from a shelf and brings it to her. a smiling doll comes forward and hands buddy half of an orange. he makes a face at her. mother takes the bottle and pours out a tablespoon of castor oil.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(wanly)}
<D>__{mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{this is for your own good. when you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. here, take this.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(he is resigned, there's}
<D>__{no way out; he makes a face, swallows the castor}
<P>__{oil)}
<D>__{geccch, yehh, guhhhh!}

<D>__{what did you say, brother?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{i said ahhh dam stuff.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{no, you didn't say that, brother.}
<C>__{buddy}
