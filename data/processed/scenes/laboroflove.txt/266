<A>__{she catches her breath.}

<D>__{how does a grown man who can barely walk, just stroll out?... this is not james bond here, this is my uncle who owns a bookstore, and gets outwitted by grade school kids pulling pranks!}
<A>__{adelle notices the new people in the room.}

<D>__{mrs. matlin, this is sergeant emory. he'll help us find your uncle.}

<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{let me tell you a story sergeant. there was a patient of mine who had a golden retriever, mac... she loved mac, not like a pet, but like a family member. one day, she had to leave mac with 'friends', and wouldn't you know it, mac gets away and ends up falling into a sewer. my patient comes back goes nuts when she hears that mac has been in the sewer for over 48 hours. apparently the cop who found the dog didn't want to get his pants dirty. and neither did anyone else. so of course, my patient decides to go in after it... she falls... breaks her hip and lands next to her dead dog, who died of toxic fumes down there...}
<A>__{adelle looks around at all the engrossed faces.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{the moral of the story is... she sued for a lot of money! she sued the friends, the city, and the officer for negligence on duty. she has no mac, no happiness, but she's very rich now... that was a dog. we're talking about a human being...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i hope everyone clearly understands the chain of events that will occur if something should happen to my uncle, whom i love more than you can possibly imagine... now sergeant i would like to know right now, if you're willing to get your pants dirty for my uncle?}
<A>__{adelle and emory have a staring contest. adelle wins. adelle stands alone in a room with four men, and she is clearly the one in charge. the door flies open. a police officer walks in pushing kris reddy through the door.}
