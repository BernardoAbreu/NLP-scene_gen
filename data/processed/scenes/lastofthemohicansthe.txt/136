<L>__{exterior forest above canyon & falls grey wolf twilight}
<A>__{watches the hurons below make their way towards the edge of the falls. over his shoulder: three more wolves join him, moving frenetically, uneasily ... the leader of the pack looks up & howls as his eyes go white reflecting the new moon.}
<L>__{interior glen falls cave hawkeye night}
<A>__{hears the distant howl. he's now lit silver blue by the moonlight through the falling water. hawkeye knows it means hurons are out there. he exchanges worried glances with uncas & chingachgook.}
<B>__{uncas}
<A>__{immediately starts up the right acclivity to one fissure, and chingachgook moves carefully to the first fissure. hawkeye follows.}
<B>__{hawkeye}
<A>__{his countenance gives way momentarily. all his experience seems of no avail. he touches the side of cora's face. grabs killdeer and follows chingachgook.}
<B>__{alice}
<A>__{sensing new danger, slips away on her own.}
<B>__{cora}
<A>__{crosses to the ranger who's semi conscious, feverish and getting delirious. she can't do a thing except hold his hand and think of her father.}
