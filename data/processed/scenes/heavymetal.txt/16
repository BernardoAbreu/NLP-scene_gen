<B>__{the barbarian leader}
<A>__{he is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild eyed, he screams to signal the attack. the bloodthirsty horde charges down the hill behind him. the camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the gates of the city, destroying everything in their path. smoke and flames are everywhere. ahead of us, terrified kraanians run from the onslaught. as we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the barbarian leader riding his war horse in the streets below. shouting a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive doomed building in the middle of the city.}
