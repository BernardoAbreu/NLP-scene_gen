<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{julie sits, shane stands "at ease" (which doesn't look "at ease" at all).}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{you have a pleasant family, ma'am.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{charles wasn't around too much. his work took him all over the world. he'd be gone six or seven months at a time. so i think for the younger ones it's a little confusing. zoe and todd... well, they're dealing like your normal teenagers. maybe in todd's case semi normal.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{mrs. plummer, i have to tell you that i did everything i could...}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{charles was in a dangerous business. i knew it when i married him. no one's to blame here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{everyone thinks that charles told me or the kids where he hid it. and until g.h.o.s.t. is found, we're all in danger.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{nothing will happen to your family as long as i'm here. i've dealt with much...}
<A>__{suddenly from behind shane's head a duck appears and nibbles his ear. shane spins in full fight stance. he sees the duck... and relaxes. sort of.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{that's gary. he was charles'.}
<A>__{the duck quacks angrily. confused, shane returns to "at ease," keeping one eye on the duck.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{mrs. plummer }
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{call me julie.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{... mrs. plummer, i will go secure the perimeter.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i'm glad you're here }
<A>__{but shane is already gone.}
