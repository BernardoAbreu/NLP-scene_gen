<T>__{fade out:}
<L>__{interior northlands insurance day}
<A>__{the drab office is brightened with week old funeral flowers and flaccid mylar sympathy balloons. tim sits across from a young couple, kurt & pam gambsky, 20s, in a small, glassed in conference room. the couple is tense.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{you just don't get it, kurt...}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{aw christ, pammy...}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{hang on guys, how's this sound you can both be right.}
<P>__{(pause for effect)}
<D>__{i know you're probably thinking, "oh, an umbrella policy's only for rich people." you know what i say to that? bull roar.}
<A>__{the gambskys smile, comforted. tim is good at his job.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{pam, kurt i've known you guys since you were little kids. so let's don't think of me as an "insurance salesman." think of me as your friend who just wants to help you protect your dreams...}
<A>__{tim glances up and sees bill krogstad staring longingly at northlands' three two diamond award plaques. a beat, then krogstad slams his fist through the wood paneled wall! the couple reels around upon hearing the sound.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{i'm... excuse me a sec...}
<A>__{tim exits the conference room and approaches krogstad, whose hand is now bleeding.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{d'you can i get you a napkin or something, bill? for that?}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<D>__{know how roger used to get down there to cedar rapids? to the asmi convention? any idea?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{um. i'm with kurt and pam gambsky...}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<D>__{flew himself. in a cessna. pilot.}
<P>__{(a mournful beat)}
<D>__{it was all worked out. i was going to ease into retirement in july while roger transitioned into his ownership role.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{wait, roger was going to buy northlands?}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<D>__{all worked out. shit, dione already put the down payment on a time share. branson, black hills. florida. units all over the place.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{holy cow.}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<D>__{yeah, whole deal. now? now i got my back up against christ knows what. no lemke, no buyer, the wife's spending like we won the goddamn powerball. and what's worse, because of the way, y'know, the way roger passed...}
<A>__{krogstad chokes up. his grief is very real. so is tim's.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{the... belt and the lederhosen...?}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<P>__{(a nod, a sigh)}
<D>__{quote unquote perverted, they're saying. like northlands has some kind of stain. oh, i'm so goddamned tired...}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{is there...? can i do anything to help, or...?}
<A>__{krogstad hands tim a manila folder (bloodying it in the process). tim gestures for his customers to hold tight. tim opens the folder, reading aloud from a cover page.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{"innovations in hog farm risk mitigation." roger's two diamond presentation for the asmi convention. i helped prepare it.}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<D>__{we need those two diamonds more than ever, tim. if i'm going to sell this company, we need people to feel ok about the northlands brand.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(not getting it)}
<D>__{mm.}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<D>__{i'd go myself but my daughter kayla, the heavy one? she unearthed some polack to marry her. i'm locked into that wedding over in gladstone. no flex. locked in.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{whoa whoa wait. what are you saying?}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<D>__{i'm not asking you to fill roger lemke's shoes. not gonna happen. i'm asking you to deliver his presentation to bring me home those two diamonds.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i can't go to asmi. to iowa. to cedar rapids, iowa... why can't lila do it?}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<D>__{c'mon tim. lila's about as charismatic as a bag of hair.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{bill, i've never... i mean, i've dabbled in hog farm risk mitigation, but i'm no pro...}
<A>__{tim is really starting to panic.}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<D>__{you were what, 16, when i gave you that filing job? right after your mom passed? raising yourself pretty much, living all alone. and i'm thinking, now here's a kid. here's a kid who's gonna go places.}
<P>__{(a hand on tim's shoulder)}
<D>__{and then, somehow, you kind of just didn't. now, i guess it makes some sense a child loses both parents at an early age, becomes what you might call stunted. but cripes almighty, do you want to just sit there in your folks old house, just rot away in brown valley dating that...}
<P>__{(subtly disparaging)}
<D>__{... woman the rest of your life?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{millie and i are getting married.}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<D>__{tss, maybe three'll be a charm.}
<P>__{(then, emotional)}
<C>__{bill krogstad }
<D>__{point is, i'm not exactly dancing in the streets here tim, but it's a perception thing. you go down there to cedar rapids, wholesome and pie eyed and all that. you show them that northlands is a good outfit an upstanding christian outfit...}
<A>__{tim considers the gravity of this moment.}
<C>__{bill krogstad }
<D>__{aw cripes, say you'll do it.}
<A>__{krogstad starts crying again. he hugs tim, his bloody hand staining tim's canary yellow v neck sweater. tim looks up to see the gambskys in the conference room staring at him.}
<D>__{montage }
<A>__{a melancholic yet uplifting song (leonard cohen's hallelujah, perhaps) plays as: tim puts birdseed in his backyard feeder. he looks at the barren trees as he considers his fate. tim googles "cedar rapids." he looks at photos, crime statistics, a chamber of commerce youtube video. he closes his eyes, exhales. tim practices the presentation in front of a mirror. he works late. he types. he power points. krogstad critiques. tim laminates maps of cedar rapids and area attractions. tim pulls a dusty american tourister suitcase from the attic. it looks about 40 years old. he packs.}
