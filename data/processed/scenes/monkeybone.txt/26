<L>__{interior bathroom later night}
<A>__{a limp julie soaking in a steamy tub, one arm dangling over the side. on the vanity is a framed photo strip, four poses for a dollar. in the first three, stu and julie are making outrageously goony faces. in the fourth, they imitate the stern faced farm couple from american gothic. she gazes at it for a long, long time. eventually she smiles.}
<L>__{interior second bedroom studio night}
<A>__{open on two photos, mounted in a single frame. on the left, buster keaton, droopy eyed, in his familiar porkpie hat and vest. on the right, a photoshopped image of buster the bassett hound, in the same pose, also wearing keaton's hat and vest. these photos are on the wall of the cramped room which serves as stu's studio and julie's office. monkeybone strips are scattered across the drafting table. alice is making up the sofa as a guest bed. as she's hanging her coat in the closet she comes across an acrylic canvas in the back, stashed behind a battered portfolio and a box full of spiral bound sketchbooks. she pulls it out. she's obviously disturbed by it, but she can't tear her eyes away... she's still gaping at the painting when julie enters in a terrycloth robe.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{who did this?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{stu. that was right about the time we met.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{when he first came in to the sleep lab?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{yeah...before your time.}
<A>__{the canvas depicts a group of surgeons with the faces of wolves. they're standing over a human patient, replacing his internal organs with machine parts. the style is at once cartoony and unsettling.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{jesus, honey...he always joked about you curing him, but i never realized what you cured him from.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{he hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. the nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting...}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{that boy looked like pluperfect hell.}
<A>__{alice's gaze goes from the nightmare paintings to the monkeybone strips tacked up over the drafting table.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{how do you get from here to there?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{switch hands.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i'm serious. it was bicameral disjunction right brain and left brain out of balance. he was a rightie, so i made him switch the pencil to his left hand. just to see what'd come out.}
<A>__{a smile comes to julie's face. she settles in on the floor beside alice and digs through the various portfolios until she comes up with a quickie cartoon on the back of a napkin the prototype for...}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{monkeybone?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{left handed, he was funny. he'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that.}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{and then the nightmares just...stopped.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{wow two guys in the same brain. which one did you fall in love with?}
<A>__{julie smiles at the cartoon. she isn't telling.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i've put a ton of work into that boy, alice. i am not going to let him get away from me.}
