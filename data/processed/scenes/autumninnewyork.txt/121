<A>__{the darkening sky is swept with a brisk wintry breeze. shadows descend from the trees and towering rocks. an old man sits on a bench, reading a newspaper. a nanny pushes a baby carriage past. wills and charlotte walk together, bundled up again the cold. charlotte walks backward, her breath shooting out into the cold air like smoke }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you never talk about my mother.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{talk about her.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{what do you want to know?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{everything. all i remember is that she smelled like vanilla, loved to read to me, and was really good at cutting up fruit. i couldn't believe she didn't cut her fingers off.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{well, i remember a little more than that. let's see... she was blonde... about your height }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i've seen pictures, dummy.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{oh, okay. she... always ate her ice cream with a fork how's that?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{much better.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{and she wrote great letters, but couldn't spell at all.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{neither can i.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{she was a mcgovern democrat but also an incredible snob. she loved blueberries. she had the world's worst backhand. her favorite singer was stephen stills.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{never mind. she was afraid of sharks. and, considering the times, she was pretty square. she only tried drugs once a lifeguard gave her a hash brownie and she threw it up all over him.}
<A>__{charlotte laughs.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{and she laughed just like that. and she bit her fingernails. and she couldn't tell a joke.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{in short, she was a unique.}
<A>__{charlotte smiles happily.}
