<A>__{vernon stands half hunched, stunned.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{are you crazy!}
<A>__{the gunshot seems to have cleared grady's head. he stares at the gun, watches vernon wrest it from his hand.}
<C>__{vernon }
<D>__{get out! what's the matter with you? can't you see the condition my girl's in?}
<A>__{as grady gets out of the car, vernon places his hand on oola's tummy.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{you all right, cupcake?}
<C>__{oola}
<D>__{who's vernon?}
<A>__{a rude squeal breaks the silence rubber scratching asphalt and grady, oola, and vernon turn to see hannah green's rattling renault lurching awkwardly toward them.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{what the...?}
<A>__{gears grinding, tires smoking, crabtree fish tails wildly, then kicks open the passenger door.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{tripp! run!}
<A>__{grady doesn't move an inch, watching in mute amazement as crabtree whistles by, proceeds halfway down the block, then turns back for another pass.}

<A>__{the car bucks crazily, picks up speed, and crabtree swiping aside a flutter of manuscript pages that have taken flight inside the car begins to veer right toward grady, vernon, and oola.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{woah.}
<A>__{vernon steps into the street, levels the german nine.}
<C>__{vernon }
<D>__{pull off, you crazy motherfucker!}
<A>__{frantic, grady steps between vernon, the german nine, and the oncoming crabtree.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{no! don't shoot! he's just a lousy driver.}
<A>__{crabtree fans the wheel wildly, goes into a slide and the passenger door snaps wide, releasing what looks to be a flock of white doves into the wind whipped sky. only, these ain't birds. }
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{oh... my... god!}
<A>__{these are pages. seven years of pages. crabtree goes into another slide, one hops the curb, and smashes flat into the weathered glove of bill mazeroski painted on the front wail of kravnik's sporting goods. as hannah green's radiator explodes, crabtree steps free of the car and looks skyward. it's a ticker tape parade ail the way down the street, ending in the frigid waters of the ohio river.}
