<L>__{interior locker room night}
<A>__{passing griss (reading anti white agitprop) and waiting room regulars, frank leads mary to a small rectangular paramedic locker area: sofa, desk, two banks of gray lockers, walls decorated with hospital rules and regulations.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he wants to pull that tube out. it's pretty painful that's why they keep him sedated but it's a good sign.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you sure? i know my father would hate to be tied down. he wouldn't even go to the dentist.}
<A>__{he sits across from her, wishing he could be in three seats at once, each to watch her from a different angle.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's how it's done. you have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{he's better, though, right?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(reluctant)}
<D>__{he's better.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{look, i'm sorry, but it's important to me. i mean, a week ago i was wishing he was dead. and now i want hear his voice again, just once more you know what i mean?}
<A>__{marcus enters with a small pizza and two cokes.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{went over to sal's got this. there must be some place in hell for a guy who sells a dollar fifty a slice. i call you if anything comes up.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{marcus exits.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm not really hungry.}
<A>__{she says as she picks up a slice of cheese pizza.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{my father was a great man, you know. there was nobody he wouldn't help. you know that crazy guy noel who i gave water to last night? he lived in our house for almost a year. a total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's best not to ...}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{it's good pizza, huh?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{not as good as nino's.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you remember that pizza place, joe's on tenth street maybe fifteen years ago? when you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yeah, or saint anthony. you from the neighborhood?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i grew up on elizabeth. i went to blessed sacrament.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{on yeah? i went to holy name. where'd you go to high school?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we moved out after that. upstate.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{like everybody else except us. always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. your parents ... ?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{they're fine. my old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse i was sort of born to it, i guess.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you married?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{ah, no. i was.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's hard to explain. she had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.}
<A>__{pause. this thought hangs in the air. from outside: a bellicose drunk is escorted into the er.}
<C>__{drunk }
<D>__{white cocksuckers! get your ow!}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{is it always this bad in here? i mean, how does anyone survive?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's been bad lately, but it's always bad.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{how long you been doing this?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{five years.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{wow, you musta seen some things, huh? what's the worst thing you ever seen?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. but then something good will happen and everything will just glow.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you must get a lot of overdoses. i bet you picked me up a couple of times.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i think i'd remember that.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{maybe not. i was a different person then. does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{mostly. it must be my face. my mother always said i looked like a priest.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(wipes her mouth)}
<D>__{i better go check on my father. thanks for the pizza. i owe you one. maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{frank puts his hand out but she's already on her feet. he grabs the last slice of pizza, hands it to griss as she heads back to critical care.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{look after her, griss, okay?}
<A>__{griss nods.}
