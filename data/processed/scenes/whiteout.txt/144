<L>__{interior medical clinic asb later}
<A>__{carrie is standing next to pryce on the examination table. he's been bandaged up. eyes closed. looks thrashed. an iv drip hangs from a stand on wheels. she's looking at him with soft, caring eyes been through a lot. he slowly opens his. tries to smile, not easy.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{hey }
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{hey back.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{you get him?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{um hm.}
<C>__{pryce}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{the cannisters?}
<A>__{she shakes her head }
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{nope.}
<A>__{they both think on it for a moment.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{what did we miss? think keller cut and run without the stuff?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{after all this, no way. keller didn't have it on the plane because he's got it hidden somewhere.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{where would he hide something for six months. somewhere he could be sure no one would ever look.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{if he had made it out, he wouldn't have been crazy enough to come back for it.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{true what the hell was his plan...}
<A>__{pryce thinks hard he's got nothing.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{we've got six months to figure it out.}
<A>__{a squeaky noise in the back of the room draws their attention. it's doc coming through with the cart a bodybag on top.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{eyes open that's always a good sign.}
<A>__{he continues pushing the gurney toward them }
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{hey, doc thanks.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{thank her if she hadn't slowed your bleeding.}
<A>__{doc rolls the gurney behind her }
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{i'm going to hunt me down a bottle of scotch }
<A>__{carrie turns, looks at doc as he wheels the gurney by.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{need any help?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i'm good.}
<A>__{she sees it's weiss' name on the tag, but something disturbing catches carrie's eye it's weiss' left leg pressing against the bag. although the plastic is clouded, she'd swear his left calf has a long line of stitches running down the side.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{his voice pulls her focus. she masks her startle...}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(covering)}
<D>__{just thinking where it all began.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{yeah, it's a damn shame, isn't it.}
<A>__{doc continues on out the door. pryce sees that she's bothered }
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{nothing i will be right back.}
<A>__{she heads out the door.}
