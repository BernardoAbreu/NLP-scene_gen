<D>__{well, folks, there she is the old hackett place.}
<A>__{the blandings look off, react with interest and approval. what they see burrowed into the upward slope what they see burrowed into the upward slope of the land is the old hackett farmhouse. if the roof seems to sway a little and the massive stone chimney to tilt a bit and the overall condition of board and beam to be a trifle unsteady, charge it up to age, which will be a hundred and seventy years come next april. however, the overall effect is definitely one of picturesque rustic beauty. in the back are a series of barns and behind them the rolling hills known as bald mountain.}
<C>__{smith's voice}
<D>__{fifty mighty pretty little acres...}
<A>__{jim, muriel and smith. jim, muriel and smith}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(involuntarily)}
<D>__{it's simply charming!}
<A>__{jim's look cautions against her over enthusiasm.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{that is, for an old house.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{of course, you understand, mr. smith, we're just window shopping, so to speak. nothing really definite in mind.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{perfectly all right.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(studies house; with assumed indifference)}
<D>__{mm. not a bad looking place, but it's certainly a lot older than anything we had in mind.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{she's no spring chicken }
<P>__{(sagely)}
<D>__{ but that's just what makes her such a buy.}
<A>__{they look at him curiously. smith's attitude is matter of fact, almost without enthusiasm.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{this isn't just old timber, or a virgin stand oak grove other side of the trout stream, or a couple of fruit orchards... you're buying a piece of american history.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(interested in spite of himself)}
<D>__{you don't say! how's that?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{first year she was built, general gates stopped right here to water his horses.}

<D>__{revolutionary war.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{oh. oh, that general gates. hear that, honey, general gates!}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(with concern)}
<D>__{wouldn't that make the house over a hundred years old?}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{hundred and seventy come next april.}
<A>__{the blandings exchange a doubtful look which smith catches.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{now i'm not trying to sell you anything all i'm saying is that one of these days someone with a little vision and imagination's goin' to come along, and just steal this place }
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{and i mean steal it.}
<A>__{the blandings, as one, turn to the house with renewed interest. this is not lost on smith.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{mr. blandings, i know you can look at that house and just about picture what a couple of coats of paint and a little pointing up here and there can do to it.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{mm.}
<A>__{the camera moves to a head closeup of jim as he begins to visualize}
<B>__{what he sees}
<A>__{what he sees the old hackett place suddenly dissolves into the new blandings' place jim's version. it is a lovely country house. massive. masculine. jim, in jodhpurs, tweed coat, pipe and accompanied by two large irish setters, is proudly surveying his property. he nonchalantly holds a sleek, beautiful shotgun in the most precisely correct position. close shot jim's face. close shot jim's face. his lips don't move but we hear his voice.}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{hm. wonder what he meant by "steal?"}
