<C>__{ace}
<D>__{look for my ulcer, i take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. and that's when i have extreme pain. i had a three month supply. what'd you do with 'em?}
<C>__{ginger}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{you didn't have to beat him up!}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(walking back to the bathroom)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{ace puts the bottle into the medicine cabinet.}

<D>__{i don't need one.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{yes, you do. it's very discreet. there's no names in the papers. you don't have to worry about any of that stuff.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{that's all you care about.}
<P>__{(collapsing on the edge of the bed.)}

<C>__{ace}
<D>__{how could you say that? you're a beautiful woman. you're destroying yourself. you don't need that stuff. you don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. i know you better than you know yourself. you're a tiger, you're stronger than i am. and when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.}

<D>__{you can do it.}
<C>__{ginger}
