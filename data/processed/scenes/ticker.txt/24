<L>__{interior police station interrogation viewing booth day}
<A>__{wearing headphones connected to a tape recorder, a bored cop flips wearily through a comic book in front of a one way mirror. through it can be seen a bare interrogation room where the girl sits stubbornly at a table across from harry. stubbing a butt into an overflowing ashtray, harry rubs the back of his neck, gets up and goes through a door, into the viewing booth. the bored cop looks up, shuts off the tape recorder.}
<C>__{bored cop}
<D>__{three hours. she's tough.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{tough? tough is "fuck you, where's my lawyer?". this chick doesn't say boo.}
<A>__{the outer door opens, reilly walks in.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{any luck?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{bupkiss. sorry about rice.}
<A>__{reilly nods, accepts the condolence.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{captain said i could give it a crack.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{she ain't no hooker. this is a murder investigation.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{she was my collar. maybe i will get lucky. but, if you got a problem with that, talk to the captain.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i will be in the can.}
<A>__{harry exits. the bored cop eyes reilly suspiciously as reilly crosses to the other door, yanks it open.}
