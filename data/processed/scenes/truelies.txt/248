<A>__{looking down from a catwalk on the activity below the four horsemen statues and several utility trucks almost fill the floorspace. a rental truck is being loaded with conventional weapons, including machine guns and several hand launched stinger missiles. one of the nukes has been lowered into a pit cut in the concrete floor. malik and most of the terrorists are gathered around it. a guard, f.g. on the catwalk, watches intently from the railing. so intently that he doesn't head harry sneak up on him. snap. harry catches the guard's mac 10 machine pistol before it can hit the floor. he and helen crouch behind a steel pillar, watching the proceedings below. helen keeps glancing at the dead guard, killed so effortlessly a moment before by her husband. it is all surreal. below, malik is shouting in his native language. he pulls a chain from around his neck and holds up a metal arming key. then jumps down into the pit and inserts it into the warhead's arming computer. harry is listening intently, translating for helen.}

<P>__{(malik theatrically turns the arming key)}
<D>__{it is done...}
<A>__{malik jumps out of the pit. he signals and terrorists pour concrete into the pit, covering the bomb. he begins ranting again.}
