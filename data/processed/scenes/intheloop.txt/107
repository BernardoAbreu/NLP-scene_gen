<A>__{sir jonathan walks in. a lot of faces are turned towards him, expectantly.}
<C>__{sir jonathan}
<D>__{hello everyone. i was wondering if i might suggest a cheeky early vote? bit of an adventure. maybe, we could knock off early, go for a drink? ha. i'm kidding. or am i? no, i am.}
<L>__{interior karen clark's un office day}
<A>__{karen and miller are looking at a computer screen, presumably reading about simon's floated resignation.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(looking at computer)}
<D>__{there it is. simon's going. everyone's saying he's going.}
<A>__{simon passes their open door.}
<C>__{general miller}
<P>__{(spotting simon)}
<D>__{simon! there he is! simon.}
<P>__{(re internet)}
<D>__{this is great shit. i wasn't sure you had the nerve. you're resigning?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{ah okay. they're not running with that? i have not said that.}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{you're not resigning?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're still playing the hawk?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{it's much subtler than that. it's nuanced. i'm playing a much cleverer game than that. i'm a}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{fake hawk.}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{fake hawk.}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{you're a fake hawk? you're a fucking idiot. you're not a fake idiot are you.}
<A>__{karen and miller go into a confab. karen and miller immediately go into a huddle and start planning simon's future.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(to general miller, as if simon's not there)}
<D>__{we could just tell the press he's going anyway. say he's confirmed to us that he's resigning.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{sorry?}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{i second that.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{what? you can't.}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{do we announce it before or after the vote?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{during. then he can't do anything about it.}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{great. that's decided then.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no. no it's bloody not. i'm me. you're not me. i decide about all the main things about me, okay? not you. me.}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{no. no simon. i'm afraid not. not on this one. this is too big for you.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{be realistic. you're being used. we all are. the one thing we can do now to influence things is to resign. sacrifice ourselves. that's our only weapon.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{like a suicide bomber?}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{no, not like a suicide bomber. a suicide bomber gets to make a decision.}
