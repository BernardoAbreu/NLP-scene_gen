<B>__{on the street.}
<A>__{barry stares at the harmonium a little bit, looks around, both ways, then casually picks it up and walks back towards his business..... he brings it into his office and places it on his desk. he tries a few keys....pressing down...there's no sound. he presses his hand on the foot pedal and presses a key and a small note is made.....beat....he does it again....and holds the note.....}
