<C>__{nix}
<P>__{(whispered to dorothea)}
<D>__{something terrible's going to happen. but if you hold on to me, very tight, you may live a little longer.}
<A>__{the cultists enter the room, knees and hands bloody.}
<C>__{nix}
<P>__{(to cultists)}
<D>__{are you ready for my wisdom?}

<L>__{interior nix's house sanctum night}
<A>__{harry pushes open the window, and climbs in. swann follows. he is frozen by the memory of what happened here. on swann, as the track fills with eerie echoes of that terrible event. nix's screams. the gun shots. the sound of the screws grinding into nix's flesh.}
<C>__{swann}
<P>__{(in terrified awe)}
<D>__{this is where we killed him.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(looking at table)}
<D>__{you didn't try hard enough.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{i can't... i can't go any further...}
<A>__{harry nods, and gently detaches his arm from swann's panicked grip. he crosses to the door. suddenly. butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and catches hold of harry's leg. throwing him to the ground. he has one of the instruments in his hand. he stabs at harry, striking the ground between harry's legs.}
