<D>__{ day}
<A>__{four long shots: all the windows are open. the sun is shining. it is fairly bright. hallway. silence. then the sound of a lock being opened. eva comes into the apartment. remains a long time beside the door. looks around her, ill at ease. finally she hesitantly goes into the bedroom. anne's twin bed isn't there any more. on georges' bed lies only the bare mattress. eva remains there a moment, then goes through the partition door into the dining room. there, everything is as usual. eva continues into the living room. there too, everything is as usual. eva stops by the piano stool. looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. then she heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. on the table lie the remains of a snack. eva looks at the table, turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear street noise. then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the armchairs. her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room. end credits (white on a black background)}
