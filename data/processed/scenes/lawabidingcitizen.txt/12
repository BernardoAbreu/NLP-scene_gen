<L>__{interior city hall grand interior staircase day}
<A>__{cathedral like, pigeons fluttering. the door from the hallway opens and betsy, a months old german shepherd puppy, bounds toward us on a leash pulling cantrell toward the top of the vast marble staircase. nick trails them, nervous as hell:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{whoa, jonas, take my elbow.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{i'm not blind. yet. i will do it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you're shitty on stairs. at least let me take the leash so the dog doesn't pull you down.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{no. she needs to imprint on me. not you, not somebody else.}
<A>__{cantrell starts down. nick's at his side, hovering and ready to grab him, jumping at every little lurch cantrell makes.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{that's the whole point of this phase. she needs to get the idea that she and i are partners. then the real training can begin. unless you wanna lead me around the rest of my life.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i will pass.}
