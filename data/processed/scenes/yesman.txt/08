<C>__{carl}
<D>__{until i'm relieved as a greeter, my hands are tied.}
<A>__{the bank customer sits down in the sectioned off waiting area as carl stands in the middle of the floor. it is very awkward. no one comes in. carl slowly moves so a column blocks the customer's view of him. now that carl's behind the column, he has a clear view of the entrance of the bank. through the floor to ceiling windows, he sees the handsome new president of southwest bank, chris parker, tear up in a mercedes. he steps out of the mercedes with a hot girl on his arm. he and the girl walk into the bank. carl stares at them, jealously.}
