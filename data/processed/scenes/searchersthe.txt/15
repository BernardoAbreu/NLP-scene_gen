<A>__{she stands alone, looking after ethan his coat in her arms. she holds it against her breast for just a moment and her eyes are tender.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior edwards house full shot night}
<A>__{the family is finishing dinner and the scene is not quite, but almost, a still life. loud in the room is the pendulum tick of a seth thomas clock on the mantel above the fireplace in which logs are burning briskly. ben crouches near the fireplace, fascinatedly examining the scabbard and sabre ethan has brought home from the wars. he tries to ease the blade just a bit out of its scabbard. aaron sits at one end of the hand hewn table, martha at the other. at her right is ethan, his fork scraping the last crumb off his plate. lucy sits at her father's right and martin at his left. next to martin is debbie. in the center of the table is the sorry remnant of what was once a meal. lucy and martin have finished eating. aaron is sipping his coffee, and martha her own plate largely untasted is watching ethan. ethan has shaved, changed his shirt. he straightens contentedly and every eye is on him, expectantly.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{the clock rattles alarmingly the usual preliminary to its striking; and then it bangs out the strokes like a fire alarm gong. eight fast clangs.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{ben! deborah! bed!}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{but i've got to help with the dishes.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{not tonight... ben, put that sword back.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's not a sword, ma... it's a saber!}
<P>__{(moving to ethan)}
<D>__{did you kill many damyankees with this sabre, uncle ethan?}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(matter of factly)}
<D>__{some...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how many damyankees, uncle ethan?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{ben!... martin, he'll sleep in the bunkhouse with you tonight.}
<A>__{martin nods and crosses to kiss martha good night.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{good night, aunt martha... uncle aaron...}
<P>__{(he hesitates)}
<D>__{good night, uncle ethan.}
<A>__{ethan doesn't like being called uncle as we must know from the quick look he shoots at martin. but he acknowledges it.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{night.}
<A>__{ben reluctantly puts the scabbard away, turns to ethan.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{will you tell me tomorrow about the war?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{the war ended three years ago, boy!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it did?... then whyn't you come home before now?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{ben!... go 'long with martin. march!}
<A>__{as ben reluctantly heads out with martin, deborah crosses to ethan's side and studies him gravely.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{lucy's wearing the gold locket you gave her when she was a little girl...}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{she don't wear it much account of it makes her neck green.}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(aghast)}
<D>__{deborah!}
<C>__{debbie}
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{well, it does... but i wouldn't care if you gave me a gold locket if it made my neck green or not.}
<A>__{ethan looks at her gravely.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{'fraid i...}
<P>__{(then he remembers something, rises)}
<D>__{wait.}
<A>__{he crosses to where his pack is a side table or something and burrows into it. debbie is at his side.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{how about this?}
<A>__{it is a gold medal or medallion something appropriate to maximilian of mexico suspended by a long multi colored satin ribbon.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{oh! look! my gold locket!}
<A>__{she holds it high for mother and all to see. martha takes it and reacts at its weight.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{it's solid gold... ethan, i don't think she's old enough...}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{let her keep it... just something i picked up in mexico.}
<A>__{martha reluctantly surrenders it to debbie's eager hand. aaron hasn't missed the word "mexico" and looks sharply at ethan.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{oh, thank you, uncle ethan...}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(to debbie)}
<D>__{come along...}
<A>__{the two girls leave the main room. martha and aaron both look at ethan half expecting some further explanation. he turns from them and looks into the fire. martha begins to clear the table. aaron gets up, takes a pipe and a spill lights it at the fire.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{passed the todd place comin' in... what happened to 'em?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{they gave up... went back to the cotton rows... so'd the jamisons... without martha, i don't know... she wouldn't let a man quit.}
<A>__{ethan turns and looks at her still busy with her dishes.}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(change of tone)}
<D>__{ethan, i could see it in you before the war...}
<P>__{(ethan looks at him)}
<D>__{you wanted to clear out!}
<A>__{martha freezes in what she's doing listening.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{and you stayed out beyond all need to... why?}
<A>__{ethan can't answer, but he takes it as a challenge and almost welcomes it.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(hard)}
<D>__{you askin' me to clear out now?}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(straightening with grave dignity)}
<D>__{you're my brother... you're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to... ain't that so, martha?}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(almost a whisper)}
<D>__{of course he is.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i expect to pay my own way...}
<A>__{martha resumes her activity. ethan crosses to his pack, reaches into it for a leather pouch, brings it back and tosses it onto the table. it lands with a resonant clink. both martha and aaron draw close to the table. (note to winton hoch: this scene should be dramatically back lighted.)}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{there's sixty double eagles in there... twelve hundred dollars.}
<A>__{he opens a waistline shirt button and hauls out a leather money belt and drops that on the table.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{an' twice that in here.}
<A>__{he reaches into the belt and takes out a few mint fresh gold pieces which he slides across the table.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{...only these got the late emperor maximilian's picture on 'em.}
<A>__{martha picks up one of the gold pieces, staring at the face on the coin: the same as that on the medal staring sharply then at ethan. aaron is examining another coin with a different interest.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{mint fresh... not a mark on 'em.}
<A>__{he glances questioningly at ethan.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{aaron shrugs and crosses to a barrel chair. he raises the seat and lifts out a pair of old boots, some rags of clothing and then raises a false bottom lid and drops pouch and money belt into it. carefully he replaces everything. during this ethan's attention has gone to martha's hand, to one cut finger, its wound barely healed. he takes the hand gently.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{cut yourself?}
<A>__{she nods and withdraws the hand.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you were always hurting about your hands.}
<A>__{she looks quickly at him and self consciously tries to hide her hands, conscious of their work worn appearance. then for a moment their eyes meet and hold and a world of sadness and hopelessness is in the look. aaron closes the seat of the barrel chair.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{time for bed...}
<A>__{he picks up one of the lamps and starts away toward their bedroom door. martha looks at ethan again. his expression is bitter.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{night, ethan... come 'long, martha.}
<A>__{she turns obediently and follows aaron. ethan looks after them and waits as aaron opens the bedroom door. martha goes into it and aaron follows and closes the door. ethan crosses to the lamp on the mantel, blows it out. only the firelight strikes his face as he stares broodingly at the closed bedroom door.}
