<L>__{interior ice grotto}
<A>__{lex looks back. there is no sign of aliens behind them. they are safe for now. she finds herself face to face with quinn. she almost screams in surprise. quinn's body is frozen solid at the foot of the ice tunnel. shaking off the surprise, lex sees that one of the large equipment cases is still fastened to the automated winch and pulley system. lex rips the top of the case off and flings it away. the empty case has been converted to a sled. lex grabs the control box for the automated winch, but it is covered in alien slime. she glances up the tunnel. far above, something is moving. headed for the surface. lex turns back to scar.}
