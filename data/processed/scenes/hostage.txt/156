<A>__{talley explodes through the door with the fat man in front of him like a shield }
<C>__{talley}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{police!}
<A>__{glen howell jerks out his pistol as he drops behind the bed. duane manelli rolls out of a chair, aiming from the floor in a two handed grip }
<C>__{howell}
<D>__{don't shoot! don't shoot him!}
<A>__{talley shifts his aim back and forth between the two men. he has his back to the wall and the fat man in front of him }
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{where's my family?! where's my family, you fuck?!}
<A>__{all three men are sucking air like freight engines. no one is shooting, but if one person fires, everyone will fire. everybody has something the other guy wants. that's the only thing holding them back }
<C>__{howell}
<D>__{take it easy. just take it easy. we're here to do business.}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{you said they would be here, goddamnit! where are they?}
<A>__{howell releases his grip on the gun, and lets it swing free on his finger. he's trying to cool talley }
<C>__{howell}
<D>__{they're close. let me make a call. you can see they're okay.}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{you said they would be here!}
<A>__{howell takes out his phone and presses a number. talley shifts his aim from howell to the fat man to manelli }
<C>__{howell}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{put on the woman.}
<A>__{howell offers the phone, but talley is wary he can't let go of the fat man and he won't put down his pistol. howell carefully holds the phone to talley's ear }

<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{jane?}
<C>__{jane's voice}
<D>__{jeff, we're }
<A>__{howell backs away with the phone }
<C>__{howell}
<D>__{you have the disks?}
<A>__{talley takes out a single disk. it's the one labeled 'marlon.' he tosses it onto the bed }
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{you get the other one when i have my girls. not talk to them; have them.}
<C>__{howell}
<D>__{where is it?}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{close.}
<A>__{howell considers the disk. if talley has the second disk in his pocket, howell could just shoot him. but howell can't be sure }
<C>__{howell}
<D>__{i have to see if it's real.}
<A>__{howell brings the disk to a lap top computer set up in the corner. he inserts the disk, and waits for it to read. he's satisfied with what he sees }
<C>__{howell }
<D>__{all right. now the second one.}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{first my girls. i get my girls, you get the other disk.}
<A>__{howell stares at talley again, then picks up his phone }
<C>__{howell}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{bring them. stop the car outside the room, but don't get out.}
<A>__{the car pulls up directly outside the door. it was only seconds away. marion clewes is driving; jane and amanda are wedged into the front seat beside him, jane next to marion, amanda on the far side. they are bound tight with their mouths taped, immobile and helpless, their eyes wide with fear }
<C>__{howell }
<P>__{(into his phone)}
<D>__{aim your gun at the woman's head. if he doesn't give me the disk, kill her.}
<A>__{marion presses a gun to jane's temple talley jerks his gun toward howell }
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{i will kill you! you won't get the other disk!}
<C>__{howell}
<D>__{if you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter. do you want to lose both of them?}
<A>__{talley aims at the man in the car; he aims at howell. he tried so hard to save his family, and now howell has him boxed }
<C>__{howell }
<D>__{the negotiation is over, talley. i won. now give me the disk or he'll put her brain on the glass.}
<A>__{talley looks at jane and amanda, and his eyes fill. he mouths the words }
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{he's saying good bye. talley drops his gun and releases the fat man, who stumbles away. talley tosses a second disk onto the bed. manelli scoops it up and tosses it to howell as mation appears in the door }
<C>__{talley }
<D>__{i gave the other one to the sheriffs and they're giving it to the real fbi. this one's a fake.}
<C>__{howell}
<D>__{you'd better be kidding.}
<A>__{howell anxiously pushes the disk into his lap top }
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{i'm a cop, you asshole! what did you expect me to do? pretend all this never happened?}
<A>__{howell stares at the lap top with the withering face of a man reading his own death sentence. there is nothing on this disk.}
<C>__{talley }
<D>__{benza's over. you're over. i just want to take my family home.}
<A>__{howell stands like a mechanical man; incredulous }
<C>__{howell}
<D>__{are you out of your mind?}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you fucked up, glen.}
<A>__{howell looks over as if seeing marion for the first time, and gives him the order }
<C>__{howell}
<D>__{kill them.}
<A>__{marion aims his gun directly between talley's eyes, then points it at howell }
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{no fuckups allowed.}
<A>__{marion shoots howell in the head, then the fat man, then manelli bambambam one shot, one kill. he lowers his gun, considers talley. talley doesn't move.}
<C>__{marion }
<D>__{it's like a storm, isn't it? this raging force that you can't control does whatever it wants, and the best you can do is survive. a winner survives.}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{why...?}
<A>__{the question being: why aren't i dead? why aren't you killing me?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{what good would it do to kill you? the police already have the disk.}
<A>__{marion considers talley another moment }
<C>__{marion }
<D>__{your wife is a very nice lady.}
<A>__{marion goes to his car. he helps out jane and amanda, then gets into his car and drives away.}
