<L>__{exterior l.a. county jail day}
<A>__{a throng of reporters, paparazzi and onlookers parts like a sea for viktor, released from custody. one placard reads, "ask jesus to save you now". he is escorted to a waiting limousine where he is met by elaine and lainey. he hugs them both.}
<L>__{interior limousine day}
<A>__{viktor sits beside elaine. lainey sits opposite, studying her laptop computer. outside the car, reporters are pressed against the glass.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(relaxing back into his seat)}
<D>__{thank you!}
<P>__{(to lainey)}
<D>__{i don't know how you did it but thank you.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(putting her arm around him)}
<D>__{don't thank us too fast, viktor. you know what we have to do?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(resigned smile)}
<D>__{why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{exactly. now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.}
<A>__{viktor shrugs resignedly, savoring his freedom.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(holding viktor close)}
<D>__{i was thinking what about you and... "simone" moving back in with me and lainey?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(meeting her gaze)}
<D>__{that sounds wonderful.}
<P>__{(to lainey)}
<D>__{how do you feel about all this, lainey?}
<C>__{lainey}
<P>__{(beaming)}
<D>__{about you and mom?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(reluctant admission)}
<D>__{me and simone. what i did.}
<C>__{lainey}
<P>__{(sweet smile)}
<D>__{your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy. we're fine with fake as long as you don't lie about it.}
<A>__{once again his daughter's words have a ghastly ring of truth. viktor stares out of the limo window as the car gradually forces its way through the reporters. he recognizes max and milton amongst the mob. max has hastily scribbled a note that he presses against the window "will pay $ for exclusive". viktor looks away.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(kissing him on the cheek)}
<D>__{don't look so glum, viktor. it's not a death sentence.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(still staring out of the window, a rueful smile)}
<D>__{no... it's life.}
