<A>__{a second darkness sweeps over the survivors. now they all stop, beholding...}
<L>__{exterior spired hills deep dusk}
<A>__{something pouring from the spire tops. backlit by coronal light, it first seems to be smoke or ash but soon we realize these are living things, hatchlings squealing in delight over their first nightfall.}

<D>__{jesus, how many can there....}
<A>__{they keep coming, filling the sky with thick waves. mercifully, the hatchlings seem to be moving away. but now one wave cleaves from another and does a quick about face.}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.}

<D>__{cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.}
<A>__{they run. reach the cargo hold. turn back to see... riddick and shazza still coming. hearing the squealing wave descending on them... riddick and shazza hit to the dirt. hatchlings torrent just inches overhead. close on shazza. horrified. hard to breathe. like being underwater. close on riddick. he watches in awe, no more frightened that a kid lying on his back looking up at the stars. experimenting, he eases a bone shiv into the hatchlings. instantly it's whittled down to nothing. it's like a river of razor blades . the hatchling keep coming. shazza whips a panicky look at the cargo hold. can she make it? should she even try?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{tell her to stay there. stay down. shazza, just stay down!}
<A>__{shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold. suddenly the hatchings vanish. a beat. is it safe? shazza gets to her feet...}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{no, no, no, no, no....}
<A>__{... and the wave is back, enveloping shazza .}
