<A>__{jake nervously grips the surcingle of the mare. neytiri holds its nose ring while jake clumsily mounts. jake bends one of its antennae down to the tip of his queue. he hesitantly touches them together and tight shot the tendrils interweave. jake's pupils dilate and his mouth drops open. the horse's eyes also go wide and it honks nervously. neytiri touches her fingertips to the neural interface.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{this is shahaylu the bond. feel her heartbeat, her breath. feel her strong legs.}
<A>__{jake closes his eyes, nodding. one with the horse. tsu'tey and another young hunter come out of the forest leading two direhorses. the magnificent animals drink from the edge of the pool. tsu'tey watches jake's riding lesson with disdain.}

<D>__{you may tell her what to do }
<P>__{(she touches her head)}
<D>__{ inside. for now, say where to go.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{forward.}
<A>__{the horse launches into a gallop. jake flops around, with no idea how to sit the animal, and is promptly thrown off. he lands painfully in the mud. he gets up, brushing mud off knees and ass, as neytiri leads the horse back to him.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{again.}
<A>__{series of jump cuts jake falls off the horse in various ways, seemingly landing harder each time. on jake, face down in the mud of the riverbank. he painfully rises to hands and knees. which is when he sees tsu'tey and another hunter thundering across the shallow river on their direhorses. spray blasts up from their hooves. jake stands, covered in mud, as tsu'tey stops his horse next to him, looking down with disdain.}
<C>__{tsu'tey}
<D>__{you should go away.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(to neytiri)}
<D>__{i knew this guy could speak english.}
<A>__{tsu'tey turns to neytiri, who is leading the old mare back.}
<C>__{tsu'tey}
<P>__{(subtitled)}
<D>__{this alien will learn nothing. a rock sees more.}
<A>__{she sighs in agreement. tsu'tey and the other hunter wheel their horses around and thunder off into the woods. neytiri gestures to jake's horse.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{again.}
