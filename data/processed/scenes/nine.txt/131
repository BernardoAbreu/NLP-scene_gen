<L>__{exterior cinecitta night}
<A>__{guido drives claudia towards the gates, which swing open. the paparazzi are in waiting and swarm the car, flashbulbs popping, men clambering onto the car for a picture of the star driving away with her director. lots of shouting and pleas, lots of remonstration from guido. they drive away, and are immediately followed by a posse of photographers on their mopeds and vespas and little cars.}
<L>__{interior car, rome outskirts night}
<A>__{guido's roadster roars away, the papparazzi posse following. guido glances at claudia, loves having her in the car, she's such a class act. he's always inspired. he's driving fast but distracted by her.}

<D>__{you look ravishing.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you're not seeing me, you're seeing lilli's wigs and makeup, i'm somewhere hidden underneath.}
<A>__{guido's a good driver and weaves in and out of the traffic. so do the posse, but as the road opens up, they can't keep up with him and he manages to overtake a car, they speed after him.}
