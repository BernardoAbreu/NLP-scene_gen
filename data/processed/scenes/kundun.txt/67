<A>__{tenzin gyatso runs up a slant board and leaps off the edge a big jump, a flying leap. he falls to the ground, then gets up, laughing, and runs up the board again. the same old monks who watched him debate, watch him play. the lord chamberlain and taktra rinpoche are among them. the lord chamberlain obviously loves watching his young charge play. the regent is not so sure.}
