<L>__{interior lila and nathan's night}
<A>__{lila, all prettied up and civilized and manicured, is setting the table for dinner. she is humming. nathan walks in the door. lila doesn't hear him. he stands in the doorway for a moment, watching lila from behind. his face is blank. lila catches sight of him. she's startled.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{oh!}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i didn't see you there, sneaky boy!}
<P>__{(runs over and kisses him)}
<D>__{you're like a boy sneaking in...}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(so bored)}
<D>__{...the back door of a movie theater. yes, indeed.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{you remember that from my book? i'm touched!}
<P>__{(kisses him again)}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{nothing. hard day. gonna have a drink.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i will make it.}
<P>__{(beats him to the portable bar)}
<D>__{i'm so happy, nathan! everything's going to be so great! scotch on the rocks, right?}
<P>__{(giggles)}
<D>__{just kidding. i know what you drink, mister. i know what you drink.}
<P>__{(pours and blends and shakes, etc.)}
<D>__{voila!}
<A>__{lila hands nathan a frothy pink concoction with a pineapple wedge sticking out of it.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{nathan stares contemplatively out the window and sips his drink. lila watches him, comes up behind him, puts her arms around him. nathan cringes, but tries to cover it. lila feels the cringe, but pretends not to have. she keeps her arms around him for a moment longer, then casually removes them.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(fishing)}
<D>__{how's work?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{cruddy, okay? are you satisfied?}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(pouty)}
<D>__{no. i don't want your work to be cruddy.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{my assistant quit today. okay? he was highly valuable to the project.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{oh, baby. i'm sorry. can't you hire somebody else?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i guess.}
<A>__{lila screws up her face in concentration, trying to come with a viable solution to nathan's problem.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{hey! i could come work for you! i know i haven't been all that supportive of this project, but i've come around.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{have you?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{oh yes, baby! i think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! what a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{yes! and i want to help. you won't have to pay me, and i was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{who needs it? i have you and i have being a woman and i have thinking about womanly things! i love being a woman because...}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{such as what womanly things?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{such as my man and how to please him!}
<P>__{(kisses him)}
<D>__{such as making wonderful dinners for my man!}
<P>__{(kisses him again,}
<D>__{leads him to the}
<P>__{table, sits him down)}
<D>__{such as looking pretty for my man!}
