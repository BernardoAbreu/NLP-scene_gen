<T>__{dissolve through to:}
<B>__{back to hi}
<A>__{still creeping in.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{better i should go, send you money, and let you curse my name. your loving... herbert.}
<T>__{fade out:}
<B>__{fire}
<A>__{roaring at the cut. through it we can see the biker sitting on the ground, legs stretched out in front of him, back resting against his parked motorcycle, arms folded across his chest. perfectly motionless, he stares at the campfire. we are floating in toward him. as we come closer, eventually drawing in to a close shot of his face, we gradually realize something peculiar about his eyes: he seems to have none. although his eyes are unblinkingly open we do not see eyeballs, but only fire either a reflection of the campfire or something roaring burning inside.}
<B>__{close shot door mat}
<A>__{it reads: "come on in! to unpainted arizona." the smoking butt of a cheroot is dropped onto the mat. a jackbooted foot grinds it out.}
<B>__{close shot bar on glass door}
<A>__{leading into the showroom. the biker's mail and chained fist pushes the door open.}
<B>__{low wide tracking shot}
<A>__{behind the jackboots as they stroll through a showroom of unpainted furniture and bathroom fixtures.}
<B>__{tracking on the mailed hand}
<A>__{swinging as he walks, the biker's hand produces a fresh cheroot from no apparent source either sleight of hand or magic.}
<B>__{the other hand}
<A>__{similarly producing a long wooden match.}
<B>__{discolored teeth}
<A>__{biting down on the cigar.}
<B>__{hand}
<A>__{dragging the kitchen match along the unfinished wood surface of an expensive bureau, leaving an ugly black scar. the match erupts into roaring flame.}
<B>__{cigar}
<A>__{crackling as it is lit.}
<B>__{door}
<A>__{reading "executive offices." the mailed fist pushes it open.}
<B>__{pebbled glass door}
<A>__{from the inside of the office. the name on the pebbled glass is a backwards nathan arizona. there is the shadow of a man approaching the door, and muffled voices.}
<C>__{secretary's voice}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. arizona, he just barged in...}
<A>__{the door swings open and nathan stands looking in, his middle aged secretary hanging at his elbow.}
<C>__{secretary's voice}
<D>__{...should i call dewayne?}
<A>__{nathan is staring toward his desk.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{hell no, why wake the security guard. i will take care a this.}
<A>__{the secretary leaves. nathan's pov the biker sits with his back to us, jackboots propped lazily on the desk. his head bobs and ducks, as if he is following some movement in the air in front of him.}
<B>__{back to nathan}
<A>__{eyes on the biker he slams the door shut behind him, looking for some reaction.}
<B>__{biker}
<A>__{no reaction. his head continues to bob and duck.}
<B>__{back to nathan}
<A>__{circling the biker as he crosses to sit behind his desk.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{arcing around to reveal the biker's face. he still does not react to nathan, not even bothering to give him a glance. his eyes continue to follow some phantom movement. when the biker speaks it is still without looking at nathan, and with a surprisingly soft voice and mild, unhurried manner:}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{you got flies.}
<A>__{he finally looks at nathan, and smiles faintly.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i doubt it. this place's climate controlled, all the windows are sealed. who the hell are you?}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{name of leonard smalls. my friends call me lenny...}
<A>__{he takes a drag on his cigar.}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{...only i ain't got no friends.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{stop, you'll make me bust out crying. listen leonard, you want some furniture or a shitbox, they're out on the sales floor.}
<A>__{smalls is pleasantly shaking his head.}
<C>__{smalls}
<D>__{nooo, i ain't a customer, i'm a manhunter. ordinarily. though i do hunt babies, on occasion. hear you got one you can't put your hand to.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{what do you know about it?}
<C>__{smalls}
<D>__{wal, that's my business. i'm a tracker part hopi indian, some say part hound dog. when some dink skips bail, crashes outta the joint, i'm the man they call.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{mister, i got the cops, the state troopers and the federal b i already lookin' for my boy. now if you got information i strongly advise }
<C>__{smalls}
<D>__{cop won't find your boy. cop couldn't find his own butt if it had a bell on it. wanna find an outlaw, call an outlaw. wanna find a dunkin donuts, call a cop.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{smalls, first off, take your damn feet off m'furniture. second off, it's widely known i posted a twenty grand reward for my boy. if you can find him, claim it. short of that what do we got to talk about?}
<C>__{smalls}
<D>__{price. fair price. and that ain't whatever you say it is; fair price is what the market'll bear. now there are people, mind you, there are people in this land, who'll pay a lot more'n twenty grand for a healthy baby.}
<A>__{nathan is looking at him stonily.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{what're you after?}
<C>__{smalls}
<D>__{give you an idea, when i was a lad i m'self fetched twenty five thousand on the black market. and them's 1954 dollars. i'm sayin, fair price. for fifty grand i will track him, find him }
<A>__{quick as a flash the heretofore languid smalls bolts forward, his fist stopped an inch short of nathan's nose.}
