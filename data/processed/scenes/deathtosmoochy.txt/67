<L>__{exterior kidnet building night}
<A>__{nora exits the revolving door of the kidnet building and heads down broadway. sheldon pops out from a store front. he's wearing a knit cap and sunglasses to disguise himself.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i have to talk to you.}
<A>__{nora keeps walking.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{we have nothing to talk about.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{don't tell me you believe what they're saying!}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i don't have to believe anyone. the picture in the paper said it all. no one forced you to perform at that rally.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{perform? i barely sang one song.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{well maybe next time you'll do a longer set.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{nora, i had no idea that was a nazi function. none whatsoever!}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{funny, you'd think the fifty foot swastika you were standing in front of might've given you a hinterior}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{the papers are blowing that out of proportion. it was nowhere near that big.}
<A>__{nora stops and looks sheldon in the eye.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{look, the fact of the matter is, i don't know you, okay? not really. so don't expect me to go out on an emotional limb here.}
<A>__{sheldon looks crushed.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{but what about the balcony? what about the klunky wunky dance?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i was drunk. don't read too much into it.}
<A>__{she looks at him for a moment and then walks off.}
