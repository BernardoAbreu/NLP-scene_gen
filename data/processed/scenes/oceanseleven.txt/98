<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yes. but that doesn't mean i'm wrong.}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you've been in prison until recently, isn't that right? how does it feel to be out?}
<C>__{danny}

<P>__{(like lightning)}
<D>__{don't be.}
<B>__{outside restaurant}
<A>__{moving with danny as he exits, his fingers snapping, he saw the mist in tess's eyes just now, he knows he's got a fighting chance with her, but what he does not know is... ... linus is tailing him, ten steps back. he stops, glances back at the restaurant quizzically, then continues following danny.}
