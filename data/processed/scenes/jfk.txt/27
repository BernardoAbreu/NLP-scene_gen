<L>__{1967.}
<B>__{justice department conference room}
<A>__{the acting attorney general speaks to the press.}
<C>__{attorney general}
<D>__{yes, mr. shaw was included in our investigation and there was no connection found at all between shaw and the president's assassin.}
<A>__{garrison's office conference room(1967) jim confronts a packed room. bill is with him.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{if mr. shaw had no connection to the assassination, why did the fbi investigate him? and why, if they did, is his name not mentioned once in the entire 26 volumes of the warren report, even it if is to clear his name? i doubt this attorney general would qualify for my staff.}
<A>__{we see a shot of the supreme court building in washington, d.c. and then a corridor inside the building. a chief justice, looking gray and wise like earl warren, moves along the corridor in his black robe delivering his verdict to the press.}
<C>__{chief justice}
<D>__{no, i don't think so. mr. garrison has presented absolutely nothing publicly to contradict our findings. as yet i have not heard one fact to refute the commission determination that lee oswald was the lone killer.}
<A>__{in his own office, jim responds to justice warren.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i congratulate mr. shaw. most witnesses have to wait for trial before they're allowed to produce sacred cows like the chief justice of the land as a character witness, who is of course not under oath and free from the laws of perjury.}
<C>__{newsman 13}
<D>__{mr. garrison, if what you say is even partly true in this case, you realize you are damaging the credibility of our government, possibly destroying it?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{let me ask you... is a government worth preserving when it lies to the people? it has become a dangerous country, sir, when you can't trust anyone anymore, when you can't tell the truth. i say let justice be done, though the heavens fall.}
<A>__{it doesn't play with the press. they shuffle off, quiet, whispering. garrison's house(1967) liz and jim watch, silently devastated, as the nbc "white paper" unfolds, attacking jim. they can do nothing. liz leaves the room, upset. hotel suite new orleans(1967) julia ann mercer, 28, looks at jim with sincere eyes. her husband, a prosperous republican businessman, watches from the corner. jim along with al has her testimony in front of him.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{in the sheriff's report, mrs. mercer, it says you were at dealey plaza two hours before the assassination but that...}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{yes, it was about 11 in the morning. i was driving west on elm street toward the triple underpass, in a rented car a blue valiant. i will never forget that day.}
<A>__{flashback to dealey plaza in 1963. it's a normal scene cars, traffic, people starting to arrive for kennedy's appearance. we catch a glimpse of julia ann mercer, 23, driving, then stopping traffic.}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{...there was quite a bit of traffic and i was stopped alongside a green pickup truck. it was very noticeable because it was blocking traffic and it was parked with two wheels on the curb. when i saw the gun, i thought the secret service is not very secret.}
<A>__{she glances over at the man in the driver's seat. it's jack ruby, wearing a green jacket. then she sees a young white man in his mid 20's, in a gray jacket, brown pants, plaid shirt and wool stocking hat, getting out of the passenger side, going to the rear of the van, opening a tool compartment and removing a package that looks like a rifle wrapped in paper. he walks up the embankment in the direction of the picket fence. ruby looks over and stares at julia ann, who turns away and notices three police officers standing near a motorcycle on the overpass bridge. her eyes lock with ruby's a second time and as the traffic moves, she drives on.}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{the next morning, saturday, i went to the fbi office and the agents showed me photographs...}
<A>__{in the dallas fbi office, mercer sits at a table looking at photos. two fbi agents stand near her showing her photos. she shakes her head "no" several times, until they put a shot of jack ruby in front of her. she holds it up.}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{i picked out three pictures that looked generally like the driver of the truck and then...}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{that's the man.}
<C>__{fbi agent}
<P>__{(to second agent)}
<D>__{jack ruby.}
<C>__{second agent}
<D>__{what about these others? you said they might be him.}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{they look a little like him. but no,}
<P>__{(holding up the ruby photo)}
<D>__{i'm sure this is the man.}
<A>__{back in the present, jim continues to question mercer.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you mean you identified him on saturday, the day before ruby shot oswald?}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{that's right. when i saw him on tv, i was shocked. i said to my family, "that was the man i saw in the truck."}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{but you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the warren commission.}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{that's what bothers me, mr. garrison. you see, they've been altered. my statements...}
<A>__{jim is silent. mercer picks up the report and finds the pertinent paragraphs:}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{this says "mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green ford pickup truck." that's not true. i recognized him and i told them so... they also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not. and here...}
<P>__{(she goes to another report)}
<D>__{...on the dallas sheriff's report. this is really strange. see that notarized signature on the bottom of each page? that's not my signature. and there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.}
<P>__{(she hands the papers back to jim)}
<D>__{i guess that's all...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{mrs. mercer, as a former fbi man, it's difficult to accept this.}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{i know, but mr. garrison, the fbi is just not doing their job.}
<C>__{husband}
<D>__{i'm a republican, mr. garrison, and i don't go in for this kind of government bashing, but i must tell you something's not right when they don't even bother to call julia in front of the warren commission.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{they didn't call a lot of people, mr. mercer. i think it's safe to say the warren report is a work of fiction.}
<A>__{dallas club night(1967) beverly, a woman of ample proportions and a big, cute texas face, ex club singer, meets with jim and lou ivon in a nightclub not unlike ruby's carousel.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{beverly, tell mr. garrison about the carousel club.}
<C>__{beverly }
<D>__{oh yes, i used to go over there a lot to see jack and especially my friend jada who danced there. it was the real swinging spot in town. everybody came. businessmen, politicians from austin, lyndon johnson's friends... dallas was a slow town back then. you chewed toothpicks, played dominos, spit and dated policemen. but jack's was exciting. there were always cops there. jack liked 'em around, but he used to throw the drunks out himself, 'cause he was kinda a violent tempered man... it seemed everybody in those days knew jack was with the mob. the cops were "bad" back then they'd shake you down for the money in your pocket. they put a lotta people in the cemetery, especially colored people.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{beverly, what about lee?}
<A>__{jada and beverly sit down at the table with ferrie, oswald, and jack, with jack doing the buying. it's too loud to hear anything.}
<C>__{beverly }
<D>__{oh, yeah. one time i came in, jack introduces me to these two guys. he said, "beverly, this is my friend lee..." and i didn't catch the other guy's name. he was a weird looking guy with those funny little eyebrows. the other guy, lee, didn't make much of an impression either. he wasn't good looking or nuthin', he didn't look like he had any money, and he was in a bad mood, so i didn't pay him much mind. well, i might not remember a name, but i always remember a face. when i saw him tow weeks later on the television, i screamed, "oh, my god that's him! that's jack's friend!" i knew right then it had something to do with the mafia... well, about a week later, after she told the newspapers she'd met this guy lee with jack, jada disappears off the face of the earth...}
<B>__{the camera moves in on jada}
<C>__{beverly }
<D>__{never knew what happened to her till herman offered to sell me her wardrobe. i said, "but jada's coming back," and i remember the way he smiled... and i knew she was never coming back.}
<A>__{back to the 1967 scene.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{will you testify, beverly?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{i don't think so, sir.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{i thought when we came here, we had an agreement.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{i just don't want to become another statistic like her. if they can kill the president, do you think they're gonna think twice about a two bit showgirl like me?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{we could call you in, beverly.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i know the pressure you're under, beverly. don't think i don't.}
<P>__{(as he exits)}
<D>__{i understand.}
