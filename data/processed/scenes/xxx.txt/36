<L>__{interior torture room night}
<A>__{we see a rusty meat hook. a chain is wrapped around it. attached to the chain, his arms over his head, is xander. he's in the middle of a bleak looking room. there are bloodstains on the wooden walls, the floor strewn with filthy}
<B>__{hay.}
<A>__{behind him against the wall xander sees t.j. and virg both hog tied.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{so much for "every man for himself". nice to see you again, fellas.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{they really went all out on this one. this is a pretty gnarly setup.}
<C>__{virg}
<D>__{check the table in the corner.}
<A>__{there's a blood stained towel covering a table near the door.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{this oughta be good.}
<A>__{then they hear talking outside and the door is unlocked. a very nasty looking marco comes in. by his look he's the}
<B>__{leader.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{this must be el jefe. how's it goin' jefe? some weather we're havin'.}
<A>__{narco guards bring in one of their parachutes and toss it on the floor. they exit, closing the door behind them. jefe goes to the table throws back the towel. beneath it are hideous, blood encrusted torture devices: a hack saw, a bolt cutters, knives, chisels, a blow torch.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what's on the menu tonight? the old blowtorch to the family jewels routine, i will bet. hey, you want roasted nuts, let's break out the planters.}
<A>__{t.j. and virg both crack up. jefe gives them a withering look.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{do you know what we do with people come round here? you know what we do with people come in our business?}
<A>__{jefe passes his hand over the various tools. he finally settles on a crude machete. he walks amongst them brandishing it.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{we cut the achilles tendon. your feet flop around like a marionette. you ain't walkin' nowhere no more. sound good, tough guy? or maybe instead you wanna tell me something.}
<A>__{he stops in front of xander.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{whatchu doing here?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{oh, i don't know. it was an accident.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{that's some accident, hombre. you accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.}
<A>__{he backhands xander across the face.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{we seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. u.s. army. you got some friends here, jump out with you guys?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{we're anti social. we don't have any friends.}
<A>__{jefe slaps him again.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{no friends, huh? that's funny, i don't know no u.s. army that comes without no friends. that's cuz u.s. army is pussies. they always come with the five hundred guys and the helicopters and the see in the dark glasses. so don't you tell me you all alone out here, my friend. you bullshitting the wrong guy.}
<A>__{xander looks over at t.j. and virg.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{who's writing this dude's dialogue?}
<C>__{virg}
<D>__{he's a pretty good actor, though.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{makes the diner look like a sixth grade play. he's even got them crazy eyes.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{you ain't begun to see crazy yet, amigo.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{we're on to the game, ese. you got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... it's all very cute. but come on, let's quit while you're ahead. i'm only trying to save you a beatin'.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{you saving me? you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.}
<C>__{xander}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{alright. you wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. now i'm gonna take the whole foot off. whatchu think of that?}
<A>__{a low thumping is heard outside. it's the sound of approaching helicopters, lots of them. then the night erupts in gunfire. it sounds like a full scale assault outside.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{what's that, eh? i thought you didn't have no friends!}
<A>__{jefe goes into a fury. he swings his machete at xander's legs. xander jumps up, grabbing on to the chain above, and kicks jefe in the chest. jefe falls back and xander climbs up to the roof beam. he grabs onto the beam with his legs and unhooks his chain from the meat hook. he drops down, six feet of chain still hanging from his cuffed wrists, and jefe comes charging at him. xander dodges a few wild swings. he grabs jefe's pant cuff and dumps him on his ass. jefe scrambles to his feet, drawing his pistol. xander swings his chain and whips the gun out of jefe's hand. with another swing he wraps the chain around jefe's neck and pulls it taught.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{keys. you got 'em?}
<A>__{jefe nods, choking, and reaches into his pocket.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{hand 'em to me.}
<A>__{instead jefe hurls them out the window.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i hope you're getting paid extra for this.}
<A>__{xander jerks the chain, slamming jefe head first into the wall. jefe drops, knocked out. outside it sounds like a full scale firefight. xander gets the machete and cuts the ropes holding t.j. and virg. then a hail of bullets sprays through the room. all three guys hit the deck but t.j. gets shot. he clutches his side, blood all over his hands.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{i'm hit! i'm hit!}
<C>__{virg}
<D>__{they're shooting for real! this is all real.}
<A>__{xander knows this is true.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{aw shit.}
<A>__{he checks out t.j.'s wound.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{help me with this guy.}
<C>__{virg}
<D>__{it's like you said, every man for himself.}
<A>__{virg bolts for the door.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{that only works if you're a man!}
