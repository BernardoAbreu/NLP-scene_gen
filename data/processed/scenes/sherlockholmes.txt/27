<L>__{interior the royale dining room}
<A>__{holmes sits in the center of a booth waiting for watson to arrive. he is quite uncomfortable in this setting. we see his observations he picks up little pieces of information from the other guests. he notices the details on a pair of gentleman's cufflinks, the name on a bottle of wine, a surreptitious argument between waiters. it all becomes quite overbearing. and then watson and mary arrive, talking, intent on each other surprised when they realize holmes is already there.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{holmes! you're early.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{fashionably.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{may i present miss mary morstan.}
<A>__{holmes looks at mary morstan looks again. she's beautiful, 30s, and clearly a woman worth marrying. holmes stands. she extends her hand.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{my pleasure. for the life of me i don't know why it's taken him so long to get us properly introduced.}
<A>__{holmes gestures politely, they sit, mary and watson on either side of him. there is a decanted bottle of wine on the table.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{the pleasure's mine. it really is a thrill to meet you, mr. holmes.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{i've a whole stack of detective novels at home. poe, wilkie collins...}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{it's true.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{they can seem a bit far fetched sometimes, though. making these grand assumptions out of tiny details.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(livening up)}
<D>__{oh, no no. the little details are by far the most important. take watson...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i intend to.}
<A>__{watson likes that, holmes less so a forced chuckle.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{... see that walking stick? a rare african snakewood hiding a blade of high tensile steel. a few were awarded to veterans of the afghan war, so i can assume he's a decorated soldier. strong, brave, born to be a man of action. and neat, like all military men. then i check his pockets... ah. a stub from a boxing match. now i can infer he's a bit of a gambler.}
<P>__{(a wink)}
<D>__{i'd keep an eye on that, by the way.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{those days are behind me.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{yes, right behind you.}
<P>__{(leaning in to mary)}
<D>__{he's cost us the rent more than once.}
<A>__{mary laughs.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{with all due respect, mr. holmes, you know him. but what about a perfect stranger? what can you tell about me?}
<A>__{holmes and watson exchange a glance not a good idea.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i don't think that's necessary }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{yes, i doubt }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no, it'd be wonderful. i insist.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you insist?}
<P>__{(at watson)}
<D>__{she insisted.}
<P>__{(instantly)}
<D>__{you're a governess.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{well done.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{yes, well done. so shall we }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{your student's a boy of 8.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{charlie's 7, actually.}
<A>__{watson's getting nervous, reaches for the wine. holmes stops him.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it's breathing.}
<P>__{(back to mary)}
<D>__{then he's tall for his age.}
<A>__{mary nods.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{he flicked ink at you today.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{is there ink on my face?}
<A>__{the waiter appears.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{there's nothing wrong with your face.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{the gentleman has already ordered for himself.}
<P>__{(to watson)}
<D>__{what would madam care for this evening?}
<A>__{watson gives holmes a hard look: that's a bit much.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{give us a few minutes, please.}
<A>__{he shakes his head, pours wine for all.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{there are two drops on your ear... india blue's nearly impossible to wash off, anyway. a very impetuous act by the boy, but you're too experienced to react rashly which is why the lady you work for lent you that necklace. it's from asprey's, flawless, not the gems of a governess.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{however, the jewels you're not wearing tell us rather more.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{holmes.}
<A>__{both watson and mary scorch holmes with their eyes. holmes pauses... pauses, then:}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you were engaged.}
<A>__{holmes' mind has gotten away from him. he begins talking faster, intensely focused, manic.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{the ring is gone. but the lighter skin where it sat suggests you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly.}
<A>__{as holmes talks, watson gets up, moves to help mary to her feet. they're leaving.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{or at least until someone informed you of its true and rather modest worth, at which point you broke off the engagement and returned to england for better prospects. a doctor perhaps.}
<A>__{mary throws watson's wine in holmes' face. the restaurant goes silent. she turns to leave, turns back.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{right on all counts but one. i didn't leave my fiance... he died.}
<A>__{now she leaves }
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{well done, old man.}
<A>__{ and watson goes with her. holmes lets the wine drip down over him.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{she's lovely.}
<A>__{holmes is left at an empty table with wine running down his face. their orders arrive an array of plates piled high. the waiter puts them down, holmes very carefully unfolds his napkin and places it into the top of his shirt, spaghetti style, takes his knife and fork and begins to cut the meat then pauses, looks around. holmes' pov happy couples eating, laughing, talking. suddenly, holmes hears no words. he just sees their mouths moving. the sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine china rises to an orchestral roar which becomes the roar of a blood thirsty mob as a fist smashes into a face with a meaty thud.}
<B>__{night}
<A>__{holmes staggers back from the blow. he tastes his own blood from a split lip. it interests him. he is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle. his opponent, mcmurdo huge but flabby bangs his fists together and moves in. bets rage back and forth through the pressing crowd. holmes' pov the room and the fight are calm the sounds muffled and indistinct a complete sensory reversal of his experience in the restaurant. this is soothing to him, the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing. he's able to feel, not just think. he is utterly in the moment. holmes' hawk sharp gaze darts down from mcmurdo's face to his muscles as they flex, giving him just enough warning to move his head so that a punch grazes him.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{mcmurdo throws a storm of punches, most of which holmes ducks or blocks. he throws nothing in return, sometimes even drops his hands, just using his reflexes to protect himself. once or twice, he reaches out and gently touches mcmurdo's face or throat, when the big man leaves an obvious opening. but that's all. holmes is completely in control until he notices a face at ringside.}
<B>__{closeup on a beautiful woman}
<A>__{early thirties, a look of pure intrigue in her eyes and a slight smile on her lips as she watches the detective. holmes' pov returns to normal when he sees her, the sound floods back into the room. mcmurdo senses his opponent's lapse in concentration and steps on holmes' foot, tramping him and he knocks holmes down with a thunderous right. holmes rolls over, stands, shakes his head to clear the cobwebs. he looks for the woman. she's gone. he turns back to mcmurdo, smiles.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{well done. thank you.}
<A>__{holmes begins walking away.}
<D>__{mcmurdo oi! we ain't done here.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(walking away)}
<D>__{not done. finished. and as i said, thank you, it was most pleasurable.}
<A>__{face twisted in disgust, mcmurdo strides forward and spits contemptuously at holmes, catching him on the back of the head. the crowd falls silent. holmes stops. feels the back of his head, smells his hand.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{hm. plymouth gin.}
<A>__{he turns. steps back into the ring. the crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from holmes' pov, all is calm. his eyes tick slowly, scanning mcmurdo, locking onto the big man's knee: a little scar tissue, nearly invisible. as mcmurdo braces for combat instantly holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves, incorporating exotic martial arts. the blinding combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong. mcmurdo falls, over and out. holmes is already turning away before the giant hits the canvas. he sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they like it, there really isn't any sport. he doesn't care. passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, holmes strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed inside. he grabs a bottle in his hand. taking a huge swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms.}
