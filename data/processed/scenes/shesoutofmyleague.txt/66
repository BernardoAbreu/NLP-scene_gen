<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{this wasn't my idea. i ain't dropping twenty bucks to go in there. god damned planes are in the sky. i can see 'em just fine from the parking lot for free.}
<A>__{kirk begrudgingly buys stainer a ticket.}
<L>__{exterior air show}
<A>__{kirk and stainer move through the crowd. stainer now carries a corn dog, a giant soda and an armload of air show memorabilia, including an inflatable f a 18 hornet.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{she's working one of the kids' charities. i'm guessing they might be down by the rides.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{whoa dude, check it out. the blue angels!}
<A>__{five men in flight suits and aviator sunglasses strut through the crowd in slow motion. they exude masculine confidence.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{those are the coolest guys in the entire world. think about it george clooney or derek jeter would trade places with those guys in a second. can you imagine the sheer magnitude of puss those fuckers tag? i'm gonna get 'em to sign my hornet!}
<A>__{stainer runs toward them. he joins some kids and beautiful women who are already getting autographs. kirk spots molly working a charity booth. he crosses to her. she turns to him with a this better be good stance.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{molly.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{kirk.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i just wanted to apologize for last night... for my family.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{your family i can deal with.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{and for me... for what i said.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{do you really think i'm that shallow? you think i need to slum?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no. i don't know what to think. you just have to understand that this is a new area for me. believe it or not, i don't have gobs of experience with beautiful women.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{is that all i am to you?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no, but i don't have much experience with brilliant, successful, wonderful women either.}
<A>__{this melts molly a bit.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{kirk, this can't work if you put me up on some kind of pedestal.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it's not that i... okay, look... when i was a kid, we played a lot of baseball in my neighborhood. the worst part was picking teams because i was always picked last. every time. like they couldn't start a friggin' game without first establishing how much i sucked. so, now you come along and make me feel like the first pick. but... what if i can't hit?}
<A>__{molly softens and smiles.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you already got to first base. just keep your eye on the ball.}
<A>__{kirk nods and smiles back. molly steals a quick kiss.}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{let me tie up a couple things and i will show you around the grounds.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{sounds good.}
<A>__{molly goes into a tent to speak to patty. kirk watches her with a calm, relieved smile.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{boy, she sure is something, huh?}
<A>__{kirk turns toward the imposing blue angel pilot standing behind him. the pilot removes his shades it's talon.}
<C>__{talon}
<P>__{it's kirk right? (firm handshake)}
<D>__{excellent to see you again, sir.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, talon. you're a blue angel?}
<C>__{talon}
<D>__{yes sir, a naval aviator.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{perfect. okay, i get it talon is what your call sign?}
<C>__{talon}
<D>__{no, it's my name.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{then what's your call sign?}
<C>__{talon}
<D>__{oh, i'd rather not say. it's embarrassing. just something the guys gave me...}
<A>__{talon puts his arm around kirk and walks him away from the booth.}
<C>__{talon }
<D>__{anyway listen kirk, is it fair to say that you and mol are close?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yeah, i guess.}
<C>__{talon}
<D>__{well, i understand that fellas like yourself tend to have uniquely candid relationships with the women they befriend. am i right?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{fellas like myself?}
<C>__{talon}
<D>__{don't get me wrong. i have no problem with your lifestyle. what grown men do in the privacy of their homes is none of my concern.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{talon, i'm not...}
<C>__{talon}
<D>__{hey, i'm in the navy. i don't ask and i don't expect you to tell.}
<A>__{talon looks over his shoulder to confirm they are alone.}
<C>__{talon }
<D>__{now, i don't know what molly's told you about me, but anything bad i deserve. i hurt that girl. i hurt one of god's own angels and i've regretted it every minute since.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no. she speaks very highly...}
<C>__{talon}
<D>__{god as my witness, i will make it right. i will get her back. can i count on you to put in the good word for me, poncho?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{um... sure.}
<C>__{talon}
<D>__{you're the man. come here.}
<A>__{talon embraces kirk in a tight hug.}
<C>__{talon }
<D>__{there you go. feel the tolerance.}
<A>__{another blue angel calls over while signing stainer's plane.}
<D>__{blue angel #2 yo! foot long! we scramble in ten.}
<C>__{talon}
<D>__{roger!}
<A>__{talon finishes the long hug. he and the other blue angels walk off in formation. stainer rejoins kirk.}
