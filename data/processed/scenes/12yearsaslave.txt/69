<A>__{ford and a group of slaves wait along the river banks just beyond the work area. all are expectant in their manner. a long moment passes with no sign of solomon. then, from up river, we see solomon's raft of lumber winding its way. slaves cheer, and ford literally applauds the effort. tibeats looks pissed. he has just been shown up after all.}

<A>__{as we come into the scene, ford is presenting solomon with a fiddle. not as grand as the one he previously owned in new york, but a fine instrument none the less. it is a gift of thanks for his hard work. solomon's gratitude is easily expressed.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{my great thanks, master ford.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{my thanks to you, and it is the least of it. my hope is that it brings us both much joy over the years.}
<A>__{following the statement, solomon's not sure how to react. he remains grateful, but the thought of "over the years" is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now finds himself.}
