<L>__{exterior space cloud city day}
<A>__{the falcon, still followed by the three tie fighters, races away from the cloud covered city.}
<L>__{interior millennium falcon sleeping quarters}
<A>__{luke rests on a cot, his injured arm wrapped in a protective cuff. leia gently wipes his face. the ship lurches again.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{i will be back.}
<A>__{she kisses him, then leaves the quarters.}
<L>__{interior millennium falcon cockpit}
<A>__{all over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound. lando anxiously watches the flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some switches. seated next to him, chewie points out a new blip appearing on the panel. leia, watching over their shoulders, recognizes the shape.}

<D>__{star destroyer.}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{all right, chewie. ready for light speed.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{if your people fixed the hyperdrive.}
<A>__{another explosion rocks the ship. leia notices as a green light on the panel next to her flashes on.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{all the coordinates are set. it's now or never.}
<A>__{chewie barks in agreement.}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{punch it!}
<A>__{the wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light speed throttle. the sound of the ion engine changes...it is winding up. faces are tense, expectant. but nothing happens, and the engine goes off. chewie lets out a frustrated howl. the flak still violently rocks the ship.}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{they told me they fixed it. i trusted them to fix it. it's not my fault!}
<A>__{chewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit. he gives lando and angry shove as he storms past him.}
