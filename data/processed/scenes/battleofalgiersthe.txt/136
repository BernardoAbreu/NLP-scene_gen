<L>__{135 ali's room. inside. dawn. october 7, 1957.}
<A>__{the room is badly lit by a small lamp which is on the other side of the curtain. there is a mattress on the table and petit omar is lying on top, asleep. ali is lying on a mattress on the ground, fully dressed, with his machine gun by his side. his eyes are open, and he is listening to the far away sound of a motor. he looks at his watch, gets up, and goes to open the door. outside there is the first gray light of dawn. the sound is heard more clearly and seems to be moving nearer. ali returns to petit omar, stays a minute looking at him, then shakes him roughly. the child gets up immediately. he is trembling, as if he had slept with taut nerves, and jumps down quickly from the table. his eyes are open, but he is still sleepy. ali smiles for a moment, and runs his fingers through omar's hair.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{omar, omar. c'mon, wake up. hurry, little one. today you're going to see fireworks.}
<A>__{the child also smiles and his face relaxes, then brightens up. at the same time, he extends his hand and pats ali's side. mahmoud enters the room from the balcony. he is carrying a tray with four cups of coffee.}
<C>__{mahmoud}
<D>__{it's almost time, isn't it?}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{then ali turns to the curtain and calls:}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{hassiba ...}
<C>__{hassiba}
<D>__{i'm ready.}
<A>__{ali sits down and puts on a pair of sneakers. petit omar has finished dressing. the curtain is drawn, hassiba appears, already dressed.}
<C>__{mahmoud}
<D>__{i heard the sound of a truck before ...}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{me too. but i don't think it was sadek. otherwise he'd be here by now.}
<A>__{hassiba is dressed in european clothes, a skirt and blouse. she nears the table and takes a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{hassiba}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{how is your wife now?}
<A>__{mahmoud's face is expressionless. he shakes his head.}
<C>__{mahmoud}
<D>__{so so ...}
<A>__{ali has finished putting on his shoes. he takes a cup of coffee. in the same moment, outside the door is heard: machine gun fire. the four are startled.}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{inside! inside!}
<A>__{simultaneously, all of them move toward the hiding place. mahmoud's wife appears at the door. her face is despairing, but she moves carefully, quickly, precisely. she closes the door. she puts the coffee cups back on the tray, and hides everything in the sink. she goes to the other side of the curtain. ali is entering the hiding place. the other three are already inside. ali pushes the movable piece of wall toward him, and the woman helps him. then, she takes a can from the night table; it is full of plaster mixed with coal dust. the woman spreads the paste in the joints between the bricks of the wall and the closure of the hiding place. at the same time, shouting, shots, and the footsteps of paras are heard. as soon as she has finished, the woman slips into bed under the sheets. the paratroopers break into the room shouting, and make the woman get up. they drag her outside on the balcony.}
