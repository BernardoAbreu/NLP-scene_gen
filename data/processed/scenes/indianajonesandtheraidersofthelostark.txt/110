<L>__{exterior open sea the mediterranean night}
<A>__{the bantu wind is bathed in moonlight as it cuts across even seas.}
<L>__{interior indy's cabin night}
<A>__{indy comes in, takes off his hat, jacket, whip and holster. the door which connects this cabin to the next opens and marion appears. she is carrying a half full glass of liquor, but what you notice is the long, snow white, high necked nightgown she is wearing. it is very prim. very innocent. and very sexy. marion does a slightly embarrassed model's turn for indy.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i have a feeling i'm not the first woman to travel with these pirates. there's a whole wardrobe in there.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{it's lovely.}
<A>__{indy sits on the cot, takes off his boots. he leans back against the wall and rubs his eyes. marion sits on the bed, leans back against the wall with him and looks down at her white nightgown. she chuckles.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i feel like a virgin bride in this.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{that's what you look like.}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(takes a drink)}
<D>__{there are some things you can recapture in this life, but that isn't one of them.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{what would you like to recapture?}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(after a long pause)}
<D>__{nothing. that is the way it is.}
<A>__{he watches her closely as she drains her glass and puts it down.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{did i ever say i was sorry i burned down your tavern?}
<A>__{she turns so their lips are very close.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{no. then again, i burned up that plane.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{you saved my life.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{and you saved mine.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{seems things have worked out kind of even.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{that's the way i like them.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{maybe we should consider all past accounts closed.}
<A>__{marion thinks about this a long time.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{no. not yet.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{what else?}
<A>__{she looks into his eyes. a smile jumps from her lips to his. he kisses her and they sink slowly to the cot.}
