<L>__{interior arena night}
<A>__{the arena is packed with a raucous european crowd, chanting and waving signs the love their women's basketball. monica walks onto the floor, tucking her jersey into her shorts. the uniforms are old style polyester and tight. her club's name is stitched on the front, "godella". as she hits center court, a smile suddenly breaks through her game face. standing opposite her, playing for the opposing italian club is sidra, her rival from usc.}
<C>__{sidra}
<D>__{well, what do you know.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{what's up, sidra.}
<C>__{sidra}
<D>__{i'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{how do you say "you're dreaming" in italian?}
<A>__{they move into position. the ball is tossed up. italy winds the tip and the ball is passed to sidra. monica hounds her as she brings up the ball. sidra shoves her off and to the floor, and scores. no whistle. women's pro ball is at a whole other level. bigger, better, tougher. the ball is passed in to monica. she drives down court, goes up for a lay up. an italian player shoves monica in mid air, taking out her legs. monica crashes on the hardwood. a whistle. monica lays still for a moment, then pushes herself up and walks to the free throw line without a word. without emotion.}
