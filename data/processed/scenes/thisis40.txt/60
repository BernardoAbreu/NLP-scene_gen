<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what is that, grilled cheeses?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{no, baked tofu. it's actually really tasty. and the lettuce is so fresh and tasty that you forget how good lettuce tastes on its own without dressing.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yeah, dressing always gets in the way of the natural taste of the lettuce.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{and another thing we've decided is to cut back on all of the electronics we use. what we're going to do is get rid of the wi fi and only use the computer from eight to eight thirty at night.}
<C>__{sadie}
<D>__{how are we going to go on the computer?}
<C>__{debbie}
