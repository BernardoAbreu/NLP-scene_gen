<D>__{jerry in suit, alone with his luggage. dry throat. clammy, holds onto the handrail to steady himself.}
<L>__{interior lobby day}
<A>__{the lobby is filled with smi agents. the blue mission statement is in evidence everywhere. jerry inconspicuously turns the corner, yearns to blend in. it's impossible, the recognition ripples through the lobby. underling agent bob sugar, 25, is the first to grab maguire by the shoulders. ("finally, someone said it!") suddenly another agent begins to clap, then reluctantly, another. soon, the ovation rocks the lobby. (in a three shot near the front desk, we see a 26 year old female employee of smi applauding with mission statement in hand, her sleepy son at her side.) jerry motions for them all to stop, but clearly he could listen forever. it is a watershed moment in his life.}
