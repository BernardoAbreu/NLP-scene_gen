<D>__{what did you think?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you are a smug, insufferable son of a bitch. when i read the insane asylum scene to my wife and four children, my wife cried, my oldest son shook my hand for the first time in his whole life. so, why is it, eli, that this vulgar little scene turns out to be so much...stronger, more moving?}

<C>__{cameron}
