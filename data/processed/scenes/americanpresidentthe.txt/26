<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{your concerns are not falling on deaf ears. the environmental lobby has known no greater alley in the white house than president shepherd.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{hardly an impressive distinction, a.j.}
<A>__{susan is trying to avert the inevitable }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{sydney, we should leave mr. macinerney alone now. he's already given us more time than }
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{susan, mr. macinerney doesn't want us to leave, because mr. macinerney's not yet done what he needs to do today.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{sir, ms. wade's been thrown into the deep end of the pool on her first day. she hasn't even had a chance to read the report of the quebec conference.}
<A>__{sydney whose brain is telling her to slam on the brakes, check her swing, smile and leave the building decides, instead, to hit the gas and swing away. the others are watching this as if they were watching the evolution of a train wreck.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you're right. i haven't read it. if someone had asked me yesterday, i'd have told them the quebec conference was made up of six professional hockey teams. but what i do know is that it's time for the president to run for president again. leon kodak is as good as it gets when it comes to electoral strategy, and i'm certain he's told the president exactly what i'd tell him: nail down michigan and california, where they make cars and airplanes and burn plenty of fossil fuel. but if i had read these eight hundred pages, i would have discovered that it's the burning of fossil fuels that's been mostly responsible for global warming and that the 20 percent reduction recommended by the gdc is a necessary first step toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse effect that has gone unchecked by this administration...}

<P>__{(to sydney)}
<D>__{it's really time to }
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{susan, i promise you, the white house chief of staff will not let us leave here until he's broken the bad news.}
<A>__{no one in the room really understands what's going on... except a.j., who would like to take the time to admire sydney but, of course, can't.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm afraid sydney's right. although not about michigan and california. the president has asked me to convey to you that he's sending his energy bill to the floor with a call for a reduction of 10 percent.}
<A>__{there's an uncomfortable silence in the room...}
<C>__{a.j.}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the president is willing to go it alone on this, but he's asking for, and frankly he's expecting, the full support of the gdc.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{the president's expecting our full support?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{yes, he is.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{the president's dreamin', a.j.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{sydney!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{ the president has critically misjudged reality. if he honestly thinks that the environmental community is going to whistle a happy tune while rallying support around this pitifully lame mockery of environmental leadership just because he's a nice guy and he's done better than his predecessors, then your boss is the chief executive of fantasyland.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{let's take him out back and beat the shit out of him.}
<A>__{sydney's blown out her speakers because she's turned in the direction of the private office entrance to see, live and in person, the president of the united states. she is frozen. mortified. if she were capable of thought process, she would be preying for something heavy to fall on her head right now.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{good morning, mr. president. how are you today?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{couldn't be better.}
<P>__{(to the group)}
<D>__{i apologize for the interruption, but a.j. asked me to stop and say hello. you wouldn't be sydney ellen wade, by any chance, would you?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{mr. president, i'm...don't know what to say. i'm speechless.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{all evidence to the contrary.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{mr. president, we haven't met. my name is susan sloan. i used to work with congressman myers. i hope this episode in no way }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{sydney?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{yes, sir?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{you got a second?}
<C>__{sydney}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{sydney gets up to leave. shepherd escorts her out of a.j.'s office and into the hallway.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i thought maybe we might have a word in private. someplace a little less intimidating.}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{janie?}
<C>__{janie}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<P>__{(to sydney)}
<D>__{this is my personal assistant, janie basdin. janie, would you show ms. wade into the rec room. i will be there in a second.}
<A>__{shepherd enters a doorway off of the hall. sydney continues down the hallway.}
<C>__{janie}
<P>__{(to sydney)}
<D>__{this way...}
<A>__{janie leads sydney into...}
