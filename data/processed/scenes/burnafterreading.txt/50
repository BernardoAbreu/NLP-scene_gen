<A>__{harry is struggling through the front door with the length of pipe. we hear his wife call down from upstairs:}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{harry? is that you?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, it's me.}
<A>__{he takes the pipe, opens the staircase door to the cellar, sets the pipe inside on the upper stair, and closes the door behind him.}
<L>__{interior cellar night}
<A>__{harry is at a workbench welding a length of trimmed pipe to a short piece of hardware clamped in a table vise. his home shop is in a caged off section of the basement. there is also haphazard storage. one shelf holds stacked boxes labeled with magic marker: "oliver in the oval office," "yea and nay for oliver," "point of order, oliver!" harry loosens the vise and takes out the piece of hardware. he drops it, a small bearing mounted clip, onto a length of pipe held horizontal in another vise. he experimentally slides the clip along the length of pipe: it slides smoothly back and forth, nicely balanced.}
