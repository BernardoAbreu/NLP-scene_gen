<L>__{exterior suburban street afternoon}
<A>__{a taxi door opens. shane looks like a bad ass, ready for anything. he steps from the taxi onto an adorable troll doll on the sidewalk. it squeaks. shane's p.o.v.: julie's unkempt suburban house, with toys all over the lawn, and a "bless this mess" welcome mat. shane double checks the address. the sprinklers go off. shane darts to the door and rings the bell (it's one of those long cheerful doorbells). we hear tiny feet approach then the door swings open, shane looks down and sees lulu, 8, peering up at him. shane eyes lulu. lulu eyes shane, then:}

<A>__{slam. lulu shuts the door in shane's face. shane frowns. we hear heavier footsteps approaching.}
<C>__{emale voice }
<P>__{(before she sees shane:)}
<D>__{look, if you're with the hare krishnas, we're not interested...}
<A>__{the door opens revealing julie plummer. julie holds naked baby peter, 2. she sees shane, and stops, a little startled by his size...}
