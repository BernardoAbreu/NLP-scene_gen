<L>__{713 magazines. he loads a pistol with the glowing bullets.}
<A>__{carnby throws aline the pistol. she catches it in mid air. she checks it like a pro. aline and carnby stand together, guns drawn, ready. there's a moment of quiet. they listen. the lights in the loft flicker. the scanner beeps. something smashes into the loft's front door. carnby grabs the para meter. it beeps more insistently. the front door bursts open, knocked right off its hinges by the invisible creature crashing through it. p.o.v. creature: the invisible xenomorph creature's skewed, inhuman p.o.v. as it looks across the loft, searching. it locates carnby and aline and heads directly for them.}

<A>__{ll that is visible of the creature's trajectory is furniture being knocked aside as the creature rushes towards them. the creature smashes right through a glass topped work table, shattering it. papers whirl around in its wake. aline and carnby stand their ground, facing the on coming creature as it lunges towards them. carnby and aline leap out of the way at the last moment. rolling away in opposite directions, they simultaneously open fire. their glowing bullets hit the creature dead on. the creature squeals, flashing visible from the multiple impacts. their glowing bullets pierce the creature and it tumbles to the ground, dead. the creature's invisible corpse lies motionless. broken furniture and shattered glass is everywhere. carnby's para meter is quiet, the readings subsiding with the creature's death. the lights stop flickering.}

<D>__{we'd better get out of here.}
<A>__{suddenly, all the lights in the loft go out in unison. all the computer monitors also go dark. the scanner starts beeping frenetically. electromagnetic readings shoot up, registering multiple sources nearby. carnby and aline back up together, ready for an attack. but the first thing they hear isn't a creature. it's the sound of automatic gunfire. streaks of glowing bullets fly through the air. it is a 713 unit, laying down suppressing fire as the agents enter the loft through the broken front door. agents barr, cheung, and marko enter, followed by five other agents. they all wear full 713 combat gear, their rifle mounted lamps illuminated, their weapons in use.}
