<L>__{interior grocery store night}
<A>__{ah, the graveyard shift. musak steely dan. kelly unpacks cat food. thousands and thousands of little cans of it. it's hard to keep the rows straight on the shelves. sarah, the night cashier, stands at her register. she's plain looking now but she'll be beautiful later when she figures out who she is. not another soul in the store. sarah wanders over to kelly's aisle as if pulled by a magnet.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{so how'd your battle go today? i still don't understand how you could reenact the battle of the bulge in seventy two degree weather.}
<P>__{(plays with hair)}
<D>__{didn't all those guys freeze to death?}
<A>__{kelly doesn't stop working. he's got a system.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{well, a port a john fell over on a couple of guys.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{that's gross.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{war is hell.}
<A>__{kelly grabs another handful of cans.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{then why do you do it?}
<A>__{kelly pauses. he puts two cans on the shelf very deliberately.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you're never more alive then when facing simulated death.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{really? maybe i should try it.}
<A>__{kelly looks at her, thinks about this, and stands up.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you are william j. stone of the 1st airborne, pinned down in noville. the germans have the high ground and they're shelling your position heavily.}
<P>__{(starts throwing cans)}
<D>__{you're holed up in a stone barn. sustaining heavy casualties. running low on ammo. the cries of wounded men fill the air like the cries of hungry babies.}
<A>__{sarah covers her head, huddled behind the boxes of cat food, dodging cans.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{your commanding officer gets hit in the face, dies. at 1 p.m. you lose radio contact with headquarters. if you withdraw, the germans will flank the entire allied forces arrayed along bastogne and break the front. what do you do? what do you do?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{stop it!}
<A>__{kelly goes back to stocking, satisfied.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{battle of bulge, the southern shoulder, december '44.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{sorry i asked.}
<A>__{sarah stands up and starts to wander away but kelly makes a peace offering.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{hey. want a snack? we got a whole shipment in of busted oreo's.}
<A>__{sarah looks at her feet, considering whether or not to accept it.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i will accidentally drop a couple pints of milk and meet you over there.}
