<L>__{interior bridge}
<A>__{the whole crew has assembled. faust is unfolding several yards of shimmering metallic netting. hunter hands out five thin rods, like metal broom handles.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{these have portable generators in them. they're insulated down to here just be careful not to touch the end.}
<A>__{he demonstrates by touching the tip of one of the rods to a metal object. a blue spark leaps.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{might even incinerate the damn thing.}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{i hope not.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{how do we locate the creature?}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{with these.}
<A>__{he picks up a small portable unit.}
<C>__{faust }
<D>__{tracking device. you set it to search for a moving object... it hasn't got much range, but when you get within a certain distance, it starts beeping.}
<A>__{standard takes the device and studies it.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{these will be very useful. at least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands. all right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship. whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock. clear?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{even simple.}
<A>__{standard shoots him a vicious look, then continues:}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{for starters, let's make sure the bridge is safe.}
<A>__{faust takes the device and turns it on. he scans it around the room.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{it's clear.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{all right roby and melkonis will go with faust. hunter and i will make up the second team.}
<A>__{they start doling out the equipment.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{we'll all carry communicators. we want to keep in constant touch.}
