<A>__{the rusty chevy glides to a stop in a parking space near the service entrance. in its payload is a boxed bathroom vanity and sink. corky climbs out of the cab and into the back, unhooking the bungee cords that hold down the boxes. she looks up as a black lincoln town car screeches into a spot not far from her truck. three serious looking men get out, leading a fourth, shelly. he is the only one who seems to notice corky. they enter the building, the door closing behind them.}
