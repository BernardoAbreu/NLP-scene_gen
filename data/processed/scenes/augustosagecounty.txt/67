<L>__{interior doctor's office waiting room day}
<D>__{barbara sits opposite dr. burke, a genial, charming and remotely creepy small town doctor. ivy stands. violet is visible out in the waiting room, karen sitting with her.}
<C>__{dr. burke}
<D>__{the chemotherapy and the radiation, coupled with the overuse of pain medications }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{ right }
<C>__{dr. burke}
<D>__{ and without the benefit of more thorough testing, an mri or ct scan, i believe your mother is showing signs of mild cognitive impairment.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{mild cognitive impairment?}
<C>__{dr. burke}
<D>__{brain damage. it may be time to consider placing her in a long term care facility. i'd certainly feel more comfortable knowing she was receiving that level of supervision.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{that would make you comfortable? you would be comfortable with that?}
<C>__{dr. burke}
<D>__{of course, it's a family decision.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you want us to send her to where, a psychiatric hospital?}
<C>__{dr. burke}
<D>__{well, beverly's gone.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{right. not "gone" so much as "dead," but i see your pointerior ivy suppresses a laugh. burke looks at ivy, confused.}
<C>__{dr. burke}
<D>__{legal guardianship for you and your sisters, with my recommendation, should be a simple }
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{leave me out of this, thanks.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{so you're thinking that if the three of us cooperated with you on a commitment end around, we'd be less likely to sue your ass?}
<C>__{dr. burke}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{"mild cognitive impairment?" are you fucking kidding me? you really want to go before a judge and make a case for a couple radiation treatments and some chemo causing brain damage? think you can make that stand up in court? when i'm sitting at the other table, doing this? barbara pulls out the ziplock bag, throws a pill bottle at dr. burke, bouncing it lightly off his head.}
<C>__{dr. burke}
<D>__{all right, i think throws another pill bottle at him.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{know whose name is on these bottles? she hits him with another pill bottle.}
<C>__{dr. burke}
<D>__{your mother is a very she hits him with another pill bottle.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{barb... she hits him with another pill bottle. he relents, waits for her to get it out of her system. only one problem with that idea, though she hits him with another pill bottle. another pill bottle. and another pill bottle. she pauses. it seems she's done. but then, another pill bottle. and another.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{we'll hang on to the bucket of these we have at home. for evidence. for your trial. she gets up to go, gets to the door, turns and fires one last pill bottle at him. leaves. ivy lingers, grins at burke.}
