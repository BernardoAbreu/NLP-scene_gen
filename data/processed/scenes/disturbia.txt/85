<L>__{interior kale's bedroom day later}
<A>__{on kale holding up a universal garage door remote still in the package. ashley and ronnie are on the bed. note: kale is wearing the same clothes he was yesterday, the stubble coming back. hair more disheveled, eyes a little puffier...}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{phase one, steal his code from his opener.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{there's more than one phase?}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{there's only two. now look, his remote's in the glove compartment of his toyota. all you have to do is pop it open and read me the switch settings. "on" or "off."}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{for the later purpose of doing what? breaking in to his house?}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{no, not breaking in. we're just talking about having access to his garage so we can go in on our own time when he's not there to just... to get a closer look at the car, the bag }
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(to ashley)}
<D>__{all this sounds reasonable to you?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i don't know about that, but }
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(re: universal remote)}
<D>__{this is good up to thirteen digits }
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{how long have you been planning this?}
<A>__{ronnie eyes kale with concern. kale doesn't answer. giles suddenly fires up his lawnmower o.s. kale's pov giles pushes the mower around the side of the house to the front yard.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{look, if we're gonna do this, it's gotta be now. he takes twenty one minutes average to mow his front yard... you'll be hearing him the whole time...}
<A>__{ashley grabs the remote.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i will do it.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(beat; then grabbing the remote)}
<D>__{it isn't safe.}
<P>__{(getting up; macho)}
<D>__{let's do it.}
