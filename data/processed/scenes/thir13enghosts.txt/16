<A>__{a bright, sunny day... through a glass window we see and hear two children out playing in the yard. a norman rockwell, picture perfect setting... a young boy and a teenage girl romp in the grass, then up to the window steps a beautiful woman, fresh from the garden. it's obvious she's the mother of these two. over the giggling of the kids she smiles at arthur kriticos, 50, sitting inside his bedroom, in a very comfortable chair, taking in his family with pride. we pan to arthur as he smiles, content... a sharp knock on the bedroom door breaks the mood, and arthur turns. our uncut camera continues to pan to the door. as it does, it sweeps across a desk decorated with family photos, one of which is the woman at the window. camera continues to the door, where we notice the wall and door around kathy, arthur's 21 year old daughter, has somehow aged from the pristine room we thought we were in. kathy sticks her head in. pretty if she ever had time to fix her hair, clad in a university of calumny sweatshirt. she stirs a pan of burnt scrambled eggs.}

<D>__{dad... it's almost eight thirty... shake a leg. you'll miss your first class. and could you tell maggie to get the hell out of the bathroom. she had her five minutes twenty minutes ago.}
<A>__{the door slams shut again. our uncut camera continues to pan around the room. as it does, the walls begin to age drastically, pictures disappearing, books vanishing from their shelves. the room, and all its promise, simply slips away. by the time we get to the bed, we notice only one side is occupied. the other lies fallow. our uncut camera returns to arthur, who sits, unshaven, in a decrepit chair, staring out at the brick wall lying just outside the window, not ten feet from him. gone is the world he knew, the beauty of a home, the sounds of a family laughing in the summertime heat. they are replaced by the angry cacophony of the inner city streets, its claustrophobic conditions, its hopeless yoke. our camera continues past arthur, returning to the desk. all are gone save one; the picture of his wife, which sits charred and frameless, propped up against a stack of bills.}
