<A>__{an old fashioned calendar, the kind that used to hang in offices in the forties. each day is a tear off page. the dates are printed in bold black lettering. the pages of days of the year zip off at a rate faster than the eye can really register. the impression should be of time whizzing by... over this, santa claus narrates....}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{'twas a long time ago, quite a bit to be fair in a place that i'm sure you are quite unaware. for our story that you are about to be told began in the holiday worlds of old. without holidays, goodness, how dull life would be without their distraction and pleasure and glee.}
<A>__{the calendar makes a sudden stop at}
<B>__{christmas.}
<A>__{the calendar page peels back to reveal the first hint of color in the black and white of the year. smoke curls up from the chimney of a snow covered cottage in a clearing of a snow covered pine forest. the stop is only for a beat. then the calendar speeds on.}
<D>__{santa (v.o.) (cont'd) but our holidays are the result of much fuss and hard work for the worlds that must make them for us}
<A>__{the calendar stops again. this time at valentine's day. this stop is short, but longer than the last as each subsequent stop will be. in valentine ville, fat cupids shoot arrows at distant chocolate dripping hearts: target practice.}
<D>__{santa (v.o.) (cont'd) see, each holiday town works all year to create twenty four special hours, fantastically great.}
<A>__{soon the calendar whirls on. next stop is}
<B>__{easter}
<A>__{where it is spring. cackling hens sit side by side on their long row of nests. in unison, choreographed like some ballet, they lay their pre decorated eggs. the eggs then drop down a chute and land on a conveyor belt which carries them out ot the henhouse and into waiting easter baskets.}
<D>__{santa (v.o.) (cont'd) fleeting twenty four hours take long to prepare, a full year of planning and plenty of care. but now getting back to the story at hand i should mention this point about holiday lands }
<A>__{the calendar flips to the}
<B>__{fourth of july. fireworks.}
<A>__{ abe lincoln fires a cannon. the cannonball explodes mid air, showering down the word, "happy." betsy ross uses a sparkler to write the word, "fourth." paul revere sets off the first of six rockets. rocket #1 erupts into an "o." #2 traces an "f" together they read "of." rocket #3 won't light. neither will #4, #5, or #6. paul revere panicks. but paul revere's horse saves the day. he kicks off his horseshoes shooting them at the side of a wooden fence. as they hit the boards each becomes a letter: "j," "u," "l," "y."}
<D>__{santa (v.o.) (cont'd) for each one, way back when, was alas unaware of the others' existence, now i've said it so there!}
<A>__{the calendar pages tear on, slowing at october 29, slowing more at, and stopping at the 31st.}
<D>__{santa (v.o.) (cont'd) but once there occurred a calamity so great! when two of the worlds did collide by mistake...}
<A>__{the october 31st page peels back to... nothing. to black. we fall in, or perhaps it should feel more like we're swallowed up.}
<B>__{title sequence.}
<A>__{carved jack o'lanterns come at us in the long tunnel of darkness. collision seems inevitable, but in the instant before we would slam into them, the jack o'lanterns veer off, turning to display the various credits on their uncarved backsides. when the last jack o'lantern zooms toward us, it doesn't veer off. it keeps coming and fast. rather than collide with it though we fall straight into one of the pumpkinhead's carved out, triangular eyes into the further black there and out...}

<A>__{utterly dejected, sally crouches behind a tombstone. she hugs herself with her remaining arm. the sudden sound of someone approaching (o.s.) makes her freeze. she dares to peek over the top of the tombstone to see who it is it's jack. the sight of him immediately comforts her.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{oh... it's jack... look at him he's so alive... so happy... he's so filled with confidence he could teach the wolves to howl!}

<D>__{he'll never notice me. why would he? why should he?}
<A>__{sally hugs herself again as best she can with her one arm.}
<B>__{jack}
<A>__{makes his way past the markers and mausoleums. he looks around and, since sally is hidden behind the tombstone, he doesn't see anyone. he starts the long climb up cemetery ridge as he sings: >>>>> jack's lament}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there are few who'd deny, at what i do i am the best for my talents are renowned far and wide when it comes to surprises in the moon lit night, i excel without ever even trying. with the slightest little effort of my ghost like charms i have seen grown men give out a shriek with the wave of my hand, and a well placed moan, i have swept the very bravest off their feet.}
<A>__{jack pauses a moment, as if letting these facts settle in, then heaves a huge sigh and sags miserably. jack's ghost dog, zero, rises out of his grave, floats over to jack and circles around him. trying to comfort his beloved master, he drapes himself over jack's shoulder and lays a sympathetic head on him. hunched over with sorrow, jack drags his bones on up the desolate hill.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yet year after year, it's the same routine and i grow so weary of the sound of screams and i, jack, the pumpkin king! have grown so tired of the same old thing....}
<A>__{zero drifts sadly to the ground, and flattens faithfully beside his master only his shiny little jack o'lantern nose on the end of his pointy snout sticks up. jack tragically reaches the crest of the long hill. zero follows, dragging along the ground after him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh somewhere deep inside of these bones an emptiness began to grow there's something out there far from my home a longing that i've never known ... i've never known.}
<A>__{jack gazes hopelessly out over halloweenland. behind her tombstone, sally can't believe what she's hearing. she peeks, but hides again. she listens breathlessly as jack continues his soul searching.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm a master of fright, and a demon of light and i will scare you right out of your pants, boy to a guy in kentucky, i'm mister unlucky and i'm known throughout england and france, boy and since i am dead, i can take off my head to recite shakespearian quotations no animal or man can scream like i can with the fury of my recitations. but who here would ever understand that the pumpkin king with the skeleton grin would tire of his crown if they only understood he would give it all up if he only could ... if he only could}
<A>__{sally's heart goes out to jack. she had no idea he felt this way, no idea of his tragic side. she wants to show him that he's not as alone as he thinks, that she understands him. but she's timid should she come out from behind the tombstone? dare she dare? should she? shouldn't she?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, there's an empty place in my bones that calls out for something unknown the fame and praise, come year after year, does nothing for these empty tears ... these empty tears....}
<B>__{jack}
<A>__{heads off with zero, staggering away blind in his misery, while... sally, still crouched behind the tombstone, continues to debate with herself... jack has left the cemetery and disappeared from sight when she finally screws up her courage and pops up full of determination and shouts:}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{jack! i know you hardly know me, but }
<A>__{he isn't there to hear her... shocked and disappointed, sally's rag doll body goes floppy again. her voice gets high and tiny... then trails off, almost tearfully...}
<C>__{sally }
<D>__{ i feel the same way you do...}
<A>__{sally stares sadly into the empty spot jack so recently occupied, then turns and hobbles limply away. she stops at a weed choked and desiccated little herb garden set beside a cluster of tombstones at the edge of the graveyard. the herbs growing there are labelled: "henbane," "witch hazel," "deadly night shade." as best she can with her single arm, sally gathers fresh sprigs of deadly night shade.}
