<L>__{interior hatching laboratory}
<A>__{grant and billy push through a set of doors to see}
<B>__{a cavernous hatching facility}
<A>__{filled with much of the same equipment we recognized from the first island, although the sheer size of this place dwarfs any of the facilities seen previously. as the group walks down the ramp and onto the floor, they begin to absorb the incredible array of technology: enormous cryonic freezer, their plug pulled years ago; empty incubators; tanks of formaldehyde with dinosaur fetuses and body parts. machines with intricate tubing and wing arms stand beside conveyer belts cris crossing the room at different levels.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{this is how you make dinosaurs?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{this is how you play god.}
<A>__{billy looks around the lab. he can't help but be impressed.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{okay if i take pictures?}
<A>__{grant nods. billy sets his lucky camera back down on the worktable. two years from now, astute observers of the dvd will not that billy doesn't actually take his camera from the bag; he was carrying it because there wasn't any room inside. billy pulls a new roll of film from the bag and zips it shut.}
<B>__{across the lab}
<A>__{amanda is passing a large cylindrical tanks with half formed embryos floating in formaldehyde genetic experiments gone awry. finally she reaches}
<B>__{a gigantic manified raptor head}
<A>__{floating in the one tank. something about this specimen catches amandas attention. she bends forward, getting very close to the glass. she peers right into the eyes of the nightmarish creature. then }
<B>__{an actual raptor}
<A>__{lunges at her form behind the tank. she screams. fortunately the raptor can't get between the closely spaced tanks. amanda runs.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{amanda!}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{back out! move!}
<A>__{and as the group races through the lab the raptors find a larger gap between the tanks.}
