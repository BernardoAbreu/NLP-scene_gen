<D>__{in the distance, we can still see abdullah, yussef and ahmed run across the hills. abdullah is clearly carrying the rifle.}
<L>__{exterior desert day}
<D>__{alarid quickly gets out.}
<C>__{alarid}
<D>__{there they are. all the cops get out with their high powered rifles.}
<L>__{exterior desert hills day}
<D>__{abdullah and his sons run full speed. yussef sees the trucks in the distance.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{the police, the police... they run up a hill to try to lose them, but shots start to ring out.}
<C>__{yussef }
<D>__{they're shooting at us. abdullah stands before his sons and lifts up the rifle as a sign of surrender. the shots cease for a few seconds, but they suddenly start again.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{get down. run. the three shepherds run, huddling as low as they can. more shots. they desperately climb between the rocks. bullets whiz past everywhere. abdullah makes one last attempt at surrender. he lifts up the rifle again, sets it on the ground and backs away. but the gesture is in vain, as the bullets still rush past. they begin to run again when ahmed is hit in one of his calves. he collapses and rolls downhill. abdullah hurries to rescue him and drags him behind a rock. ahmed won't stop screaming from the pain.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{they shot me, they shot me... yussef dives on his belly and snakes his way through the rocks. he gets the rifle, loads it and aims at the trucks. he shoots without hitting anything. abdullah turns to him.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{don't shoot, don't shoot! yussef doesn't pay attention. he loads again and aims.}
