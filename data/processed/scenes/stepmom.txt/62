<L>__{interior emergency room day}
<A>__{a full house of walk ins with assorted needs, none of which appear to require george clooney on an urgent basis. across the room, an irritated jackie finishes the last of the paperwork at the nurses station. exchanges a less than pleasantry with the less than helpful duty nurse, and... ...heads off through the crowd, down a hallway, turns a corner, to see... luke stands by a doorway. smiling, as he gazes into a hospital room. jackie comes to his side, looks in... ben doesn't see them. his back is turned, as he talks to rachel, who sits on the side of his bed, feeding him the pudding she got from a vending machine.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{...for christmas, okay? every magician needs a white dove, a real one, they do !}

<D>__{well, that's a long way off, sweetie. we'll talk to mom and dad...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{dad! you can talk him into anything!}
<A>__{unseen by the two, luke grins. then, ben snuggles into rachel's arms and kisses her. jackie stares.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(singing softly)}
<D>__{'in the still...still of the ni ight...i held you... held you so ti ight'...take it, man...}

<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(softly)}

<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it is. it's about time.}
<A>__{he give her a goofy give me a break face. she twists the corner of a smile.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{she's a charmer, you'll see. in fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{stop. you're making me insecure.}
<A>__{now they're smiling at each other. in the old way. a nice moment for them.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you changed your hair.}
<A>__{and we notice. it does look different.}

<D>__{it's temporary.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(grins)}

<A>__{her look holds. an odd extra beat.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{not the term i'd use.}
<A>__{he glances back through the doorway...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you want us to take him tonight? give you some private time with annab....}

<D>__{i will drop him at tucker's party saturday, if one of you guys can pick him up. i have to go into the city.}
<A>__{and breezes by him into the room. ben wheels to see her...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you know what happens to spaghetti when it waits around for you too long?}
<A>__{he really thinks. actually...}
