<L>__{exterior the mountains night}
<A>__{the cattle stands in silhouette. we hear singing. everyone is sitting around a campfire. frank's playing the guitar, singing along with tom. they laugh when a lyric or a note goes wrong. everyone is enjoying it. annie, her arms around her knees, sits off by herself. the song ends and people applaud. frank hands the guitar to hank;}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{play that sweet one you know. the one makes my wife here so friendly.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(slaps his shoulder)}
<D>__{you!}
<A>__{hank begins to play and sing a painfully pretty song. his sweet voice is stark contrast to his gruff, strongman appearance. frank offers his hand to diane, she slaps it away and laughs, he helps her up and they start to dance. as everyone watches... joe stands and offers his hand to grace;}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{i wouldn't let happen.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(affectionately)}
<D>__{you know, you're a good kid.}
<A>__{joe smiles and helps her up. they come together and start dancing. annie is watching, holding her breath with gratitude. tom notices annie off by herself and crosses to her. he extends his hand. she hesitates, looks again to grace with joe, then accepts... his hand slide to her back. her hand to his shoulder. they dance. their bodies closer than they've ever been. slowly, she leans her head against his body. and surrenders, for the moment... diane sees them. she holds her husband fast, and buries her head on his neck.}
