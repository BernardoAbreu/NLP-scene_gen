<T>__{cut:}
<B>__{vaults and crypts}
<A>__{kafka makes his way through the shadows down here in the underground depths of the castle. a fiery glow and noise comes from an archway ahead of him. when he gets to it and looks through he sees a sweating stoker shoveling coal into a giant furnace.}
<T>__{cut:}
<B>__{near the end of a thin passageway}
<A>__{a sudden door slam. kafka dodges back around a corner. he hears: the quick cry of a man's agony, a scuffle of shoes on hard stone floor, a dull thud, a wave of peculiar shouts, running footsteps, more mumbled mingled voices which soon die out, leaving silence.}
<B>__{around the corner}
<A>__{kafka walks slowly, straining his neck a bit in expectation of whatever lies ahead. the passage brings him to a row of dungeon cells. a line of doors with a barred window in each. one of them isn't closed and lying across the threshold is the laborer who chased kafka from the quarries the other night. the knife is gone from his sheath and his scull is caved in, a wooden stool lying on the floor beside him. at the other end of the row of cells another door swings open at the top of a few steps. suddenly fingers spear through the bars of another cell to touch kafka! a gaunt man inside.}
<C>__{gaunt man}
<D>__{you've killed him! like a dog!}
<A>__{kafka dropped his lantern in surprise, and shrinks back, crunching glass.}
<C>__{gaunt man}
<D>__{ they won't like that. not a bit!}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i didn't }
<A>__{the inhabitants of the other cells start rattling their bars and beseeching kafka. he looks around, bewildered and horrified. hideous faces looking back at him.}
<C>__{gaunt man}
<D>__{you'll incriminate the rest of us! let me out too!}
<A>__{shuddering, kafka is moving away, making it through the shocking gauntlet, toward the door at the other end.}
<C>__{horrible voices}
<D>__{help us! release us!}
<C>__{gaunt man}
<P>__{(yelling above the din)}
<D>__{you're in the bowels now, my friend! you've thrown yourself in it now!}
<A>__{a haggard man who may have had his tongue cut out gestures desperately at a lever on the wall to unlock the cells. kafka starts to tentatively reach for it when there's a sudden shriek beside him. he whirls to see, behind more bars, the raving, convoluted face of the creature that stalked him at his office (whose loose eye has now gone completely) banging violently against his door.}
<C>__{gaunt man}
<D>__{let me out i'm all right they haven't treated me yet! we can go together!}
<A>__{but now the evil mr. pick appears at the end of the passage from which kafka came a gun in his hand.}
<C>__{mr. pick}
<D>__{you !}
<A>__{kafka yanks the lever and runs away. mr. pick fires after him, starting to chase but the prisoners are coming out of their cells coming for him.}
