<L>__{interior the underwater tunnel night}
<A>__{the sub enters an underwater tunnel that penetrates into the cliffs. indy is held to the periscope by his crossed legs and the whip. his impromptu air bubble is working, but it's a struggle to maintain it. the sub begins to cut through think marine vegetation. each dangling growth pulls at indy's body and slaps at his leather bubble. now a clump of entwined seaweed rips the leather out of his hands and his bubble of air rises away. indy hangs on, holding his breath, but the vegetation gets denser. finally, it pulls him off the periscope. the sub moves on, disappearing ahead. indy rises desperately through the dark water, his hand outstretched. then, almost simultaneously, hand and head hit solid rock. but no air. indy feels along the ceiling of rock. nothing. it's all submerged. indy dives, stroking deep into the tunnel. when he has descended 15 feet, he grabs a vine and steadies himself. his eyes search the dim roof of the tunnel. he sees his last hope in the distance a small blue circle, an air pocket. he swims for it. in the air pocket, indy's head breaks the surface and smashes into rock again. the pocket is only six inches deep. no matter. indy loves it. he'd like to move in. he gulps air.}
