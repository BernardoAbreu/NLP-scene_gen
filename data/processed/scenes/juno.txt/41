<A>__{mark and vanessa loring have an impressive, though generic mcmansion. the entire yard is unlandscaped soil. mac presses the doorbell while juno chews her nails uncomfortably. both look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them. vanessa opens the door. she's a pretty, meticulous woman in her early thirties. very banana republic.}

<C>__{juno}
<D>__{vanessa, right?}
<C>__{mac}
