<L>__{interior shelly's office night}
<A>__{lou shoves bernie inside. bernie kisses floor. shelly strides past, leans against his desk. bernie slowly drags himself to his feet.}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(a hoarse whisper)}
<D>__{why? why, shelly?}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{because you never give up a good thing, bernie. you are a good thing. the best fuckin' cooler there ever was. and i need him back.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{he ain't never comin' back.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{that's a dead man talking.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{i'm through with this joint, shelly. natalie and me, we just got married. we're outta here. i will get a job out there in the world. send you half my paycheck every month. make good on my obligations.}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{(gets in bernie's face)}
<D>__{you try to walk on me, bernie, and i will fuckin' bury you. the both of you.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{shelly's expression: oh yeah?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{you whack me, then bernie lootz ain't the world's biggest loser no more. that honor's gonna fall upon you, shelly. and maybe you had it all along.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{what the fuck? me? i'm the loser?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{what you got? what do you got in your life besides this joint?}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{what the fuck more do i need?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{you got nothin', shelly. this place your legacy it's a mirage. you turn your back and it don't even exist. there's no day, there's no night, it's all just one big fuckin' blur and it don't count for nothin'!}
<A>__{shelly looks to tony and lou:}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{you believe this fuckin' guy?}
<A>__{bernie gets eye to eye with shelly. a first.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{i feel real sorry for you. yeah, you got this fear of germs thing. but it goes deeper than that. you can't get close to no one. on an emotional level. you're the worst kind of gambler there ever was: too scared to put his chips on the table. too scared to open his heart... to extend any real kinda friendship. always afraid it's gonna end out in the desert. well, sweet fuckin' dreams, pal, 'cause i'm out and if that's where it ends, that's where it ends.}
<A>__{bernie turns his back on shelly, strides over to the door.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{that's a real heartfelt speech, lootz. all that jimmy stewart in ya face intensity. you almost sold me.}
<P>__{(massages his throat)}
<D>__{man, i've got a fucking lump in my throat.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{but it still don't change things. you bail on me without making good on my 150 g's and i'm gonna be forced to close the books on you. you and the broad. you leave me no choice.}
<A>__{bernie turns, looks at shelly. shelly's dead serious. they hard stare each other for a beat. bernie doesn't say anything. at least, not out loud. his eyes do all the talking: "i guess you leave me no choice either." hold on bernie's steely resolve.}
