<C>__{clough}
<D>__{you still awake? you should be asleep.}
<C>__{nigel}
<D>__{tell us a joke, dad?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{a joke? all right. there's this bloke walking about in london, when all of a sudden, the city gets hit by a russian `a' bomb. booooooooom.}
<A>__{clough sits down, strokes his son's head..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{and all the buildings have fallen down. and all the people are dead. and now this bloke is the only man left in the whole of london.}
<A>__{clough continues stroking his son's hair..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{and he suddenly feels very, very lonely because there's no one else to talk to. nobody else but him.}
<A>__{clough's son falls asleep. clough doesn't notice..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{so he decides that he's had enough, that he can't bear being this lonely, and so he climbs up to the top of the one building still standing. the post office tower. and then he jumps off. and he's falling down, down and down and down, the sixteenth floor, the fifteenth floor, the fourteenth, and that's when he hears the phone ringing...}
<A>__{clough looks down. and gets two unexpected shocks. the first is that his son is already asleep. the second is, there is a tear running down his own cheek.}
