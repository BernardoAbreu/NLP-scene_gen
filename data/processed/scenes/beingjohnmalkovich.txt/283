<L>__{interior las vegas theater night}
<A>__{the house is filling with formally dressed audience members. the cultists and lester, also in tuxes and gowns, are among them. the lights go down.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, it is the great privilege of the luxor hotel and casino to present craig schwartz and his magical puppet john malkovich.}
<A>__{the orchestra starts up. the curtains part.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{blasphemous bastard.}
<A>__{malkovich tap dances out onto the stage. he is amazingly nimble and the audience "oohs" and "aahs."}
<C>__{lester }
<P>__{(grudgingly)}
<D>__{pretty good though.}
<A>__{malkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one knee and, with spread arms, begins singing: "kiss today goodbye." in a beautiful tenor. the orchestra catches up with him. the audience goes wild. a pretty boy young man with a big tousle of black hair and a shiny, tight suit appears at the back of the house. an usher glances over at him.}
<C>__{usher}
<D>__{oh, mr. mantini! we weren't expecting you tonight, sir. um, i'm afraid there's not an empty seat in the entire house.}
<C>__{mantini}
<P>__{(not taking his eyes from the stage)}
<D>__{make one empty.}
<C>__{usher}
<D>__{y y y es sir.}
<A>__{the usher looks nervously around for someone to boot. martini waits in the back. on stage, malkovich is now performing the "back of the car scene" from "on the waterfront." he alternates between the marlon brando part and the rod steiger part, moving back and forth from one stool to the another. he performs it magnificently. we see lester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{not too shabby.}
<A>__{mantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a beautiful woman. her boyfriend is being hauled toward the exit by the usher. the beautiful woman watches, with some concern, as the boyfriend is taken away. then she turns and smiles flirtatiously at mantini. mantini smiles back. on stage malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and juggling chainsaws.}
<C>__{mantini}
<D>__{nothing more than a goddamn clown.}
<A>__{at this point the entire audience stands and gives malkovich a spontaneous standing ovation. all except mantini. even the cultists get up.}
