<L>__{interior insurance office branch's office moments later}
<A>__{tight on: a mounted salmon we pull back to see the walls lined with souvenirs of a life spent on the edge of the wilderness; citations from the rotarians, pictures of sponsored hockey teams... we are frank branch (50s), a mid level management type sits across from paul barnell (40s), a mild mannered everyman wrapped in a cheap suit. paul takes in the display. the two men sit in silence, smiling politely at one another.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's... quite the fish.}
<A>__{branch is about to answer when ted enters with a slim file.}
<C>__{branch}
<D>__{paul barnell, ted watters.}
<A>__{handshakes. paul makes steady eye contact. ted notices.}
<C>__{branch }
<D>__{mr. barnell wants to talk to us about his brother's life insurance policy.}
<A>__{ted sits and flips open the file.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{raymond, isn't it?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes, raymond. you see, as i've already explained to mr. branch, he's been gone for five years now, and i thought it might be time to... move on.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{by move on you mean...?}
<C>__{branch}
<D>__{...cash in raymond's policy.}
<A>__{ted smiles to himself.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i just thought, well, it's pretty unlikely he's still alive. my dad always wanted us to be able to look after each other if anything should ever happen. and to be frank, money's a little }
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i understand mr. barnell, but here's the thing. with no actual body, under alaskan statutes a person must be missing for seven years before he or she can be legally declared dead and that's not withstanding an investigation period where concerned parties can take up to another year to file interventions concerning the motion. so, even though your brother's status is undetermined at this point, there's really very little we can do for you.}
<A>__{ted flips the file shut. case closed. branch, not entirely happy with ted's demeanor, forces a smile.}
<C>__{branch}
<D>__{of course we are extremely sorry for your loss.}
<A>__{branch looks at ted. ted turns to paul.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh, absolutely.}
