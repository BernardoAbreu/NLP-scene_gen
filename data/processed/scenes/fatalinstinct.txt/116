<C>__{ned}
<D>__{yeah... well i call it a "high tech lynching of an uppity white housewife."}
<L>__{interior cavernous room day}
<A>__{it's huge, dark and shadowy. more than a dozen heavily armed police officers stand guard all around the perimeter. in the center is a cell constructed of iron bars, like an animal cage. ned and laura enter. arch steps over.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(seeing the cage)}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{only cell available. they had that serial killer locked up here... you know, the one who talks his victims to death then eats them... hannibal the lecturer. but they let him out for a three week tour to publicize his new book.}
<A>__{arch hands him a hardbound book.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(reading the cover)}
<D>__{"to serve man."}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{it's a cookbook.}
<A>__{ned flips it over. angle the book ned's pov on the back is a picture of hannibal the lecturer... wearing a baseball catcher's mask with barbed wire over the mouth.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{and look, look... he autographed it.}
<A>__{arch pulls the front cover of the book open, pointing.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(reads it)}
<D>__{to arch... love to have you for dinner sometime... hannibal.}
<P>__{(hands it back)}
<D>__{very nice.}
<A>__{arch points toward the cage.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{they're waiting for ya. they didn't want to start without her attorney being present.}
<A>__{close on lana canted angle there's a big moth on her mouth. the camera pulls back slowly. a beat... she spits the moth off, irritated.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{pffftt! damn moths! this place could use a good exterminator.}
<A>__{three police investigators sit opposite lana at a long table. moths flutter everywhere.}
<D>__{investigator # 2}
<P>__{(to police guard)}
<D>__{let's get the swat team in here.}
<A>__{ned, laura and arch enter the cage as the guard exits.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{can't you get me out of this cage, ned? i'm goin' buggy in here.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{judge said no bail. don't worry. just tell the truth, you'll be fine.}
<A>__{he turns to the investigators.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{who's gonna handle the interrogation?}
<C>__{investigator 1}
<D>__{it's your collar... your bust... your call... your show... your play... your move... your wife...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{okay, okay!... i will handle it.}
<A>__{laura sits at the far end of the table and opens her notebook. lana pulls out her mirrored compact, starts to apply lipstick.}
<C>__{investigator 2}
<D>__{sorry mrs. ravine... there's no makeup allowed in this building.}
<A>__{he nods toward a warning sign: a circle around a lipstick with a diagonal line thru it. she responds, cool, confident.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{what're you gonna do... arrest me for primping?}
<A>__{in the b.g., members of the swat team desperately swat at the fluttering moths. ned spins his chair around, plants one foot on it, leans on his knee, looking hard at lana.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{don't give us a tough time. just spill it! what were you doing on that train?}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{well...}
<A>__{ned raises his hand, sits down, leans close, changing his tone.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(confidential)}
<D>__{as your attorney, i must advise you... you don't have to answer that question.}
<A>__{ned stands, paces, agitated... plants his foot on the chair again. he leans toward her... getting tough again.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{alright, quit playing games with us!}
<P>__{(fires questions)}
<D>__{who put ya up to it? where'd you get the gun? what's your link with the cia?}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{i...}
<A>__{ned jumps in, motioning with his hands for this to stop.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{whoa whoa whoa whoa! that's it! i will not tolerate this unwarranted badgering of my client. she'll have her day in court, gentlemen.}
<A>__{he slams his briefcase shut and turns to lana, sincere.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i want to thank you, mrs. ravine, for being so cooperative with these gentlemen.}
<P>__{(turns to laura)}
<D>__{did you get all that down, laura. every word she said?}
