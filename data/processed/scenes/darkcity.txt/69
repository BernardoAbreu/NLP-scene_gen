<L>__{interior subway station night}
<A>__{underground. constant noise o.s. of trains arriving and departing but none are seen. camera moves past broken tiles on a wall to reveal: white sitting amidst rubbish on the ground, looking around, confused, groggy from sleep. he looks down at his hands, unsuccessfully tries to free them from the cuffs.}
<B>__{move in tight on white}
<A>__{he starts to cry. he puts his head in his hands, his body spasms with each sob. several angles of the empty corridors of the subway. white's crying is heard echoic. back on white a small feminine hand touches his head. startled, he throws himself back, like he's about to be attacked. the beautiful japanese woman from the church looks down at him.}
