<A>__{low angle through the trees as the soviet assault helicopter passes overhead, its searchlight sweeping. the canopy of foliage lashes violently as the rotor wash blasts through it. monkeys shriek and leap about. on rambo foreground as the godlike shaft of light moves through the brush behind him. searching. passing within a meter of him. he moves quickly off. the disk of hideously bright light passes over two guards, blinding them. one trips and goes down. the other, the outermost man of the sweep, waits for him to rise. and waits.}
