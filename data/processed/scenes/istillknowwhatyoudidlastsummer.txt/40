<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...dave?}
<A>__{there's no answer from dead dave. ray tries to see around the headlights. he moves slowly toward the truck. the brights and fogs come on, blinding ray. the truck's engine revs. the truck rolls a few inches, adjusting a bead on ray. then, tires spinning, the truck launches straight at ray. ray runs at the truck. at the last minute, he ducks behind the parked car. his truck goes screaming past. ray backs around the car an eighteen wheeler goes barreling by in the other direction. ray dives out of the way.}
<B>__{in the road}
<A>__{ray is exposed. he sees his truck closing fast. he's got nowhere to go. then, at the very last second,}
<B>__{ray}
<A>__{jumps off the edge of the road. his truck slams into the barrier right where ray was standing. sparks fly! metal buckles! ray falls through the air. lands hard on his leg. tumbles down the hill, finally stopping with a crash. he lies motionless at the bottom of a ravine.}
