She SCREAMS through the closed window as a car passes by. Sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another campus street. Big, stone school buildings line each side of a thin, road. She eyes the Ghost through the rearview window. The white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her. The Ghost hits the gas, picking up speed. Sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her. She rips it open, rustling through it frantically. She pulls books, pencils, paper... Sid grabs a long, yellow No.2 pencil. She grips it hard, looking to the metal grate just behind the driver's seat. The Ghost's neck is right up against it. Sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the Ghost's head, ready to attack. Without pause, Sid RAMS the pencil through the grate, into the Ghost's neck.

After what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over with her foot and nudges the Ghost. No movement. Nothing. She slides across the seat towards the Ghost, moving to his side. She reaches with her hand and pushes on the Ghost's shoulder. His body moves, slumping back against the back of the seat. It clears space for her to pass through. She sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost. With her leg, she reaches over him, straddling him. She leans against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching for the door knob. HONK! Her back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask. He doesn't move. He's completely out cold.
