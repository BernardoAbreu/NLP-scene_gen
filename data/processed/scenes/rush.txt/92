<A>__{later: the victorious niki, wearing the garland, is all smiles, giving `winner' interviews, surrounded by marlene and a delighted luca di montezemolo. james is also giving interviews, but in a total fury. vibrating with anger. still complaining about the disqualification. complaining about a conspiracy. complaining. niki finishes talking to journalists, and walks off, through crowds, and bumps into james..}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{so...six races in. how's it going so far?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{fine! just got a little problem with a bad loser rat and his team of italian saboteurs who've destroyed my car.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i won that race in spain. and you know it.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{in an illegal car.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{the aerofoil was five eighths of an inch too long!! something that doesn't have the slightest effect on car speed. you complained. now we've had to totally rebuild the car and it's become a monster.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{at least it's a legal monster.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{a car that was beating you week in week out, so you have to resort to this. cheating.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{he drives in an illegal car and he calls me the cheat? let me tell you: two weeks before that race in spain, we put 20 inch rims on the rear wheels. we get an extra half second speed on each lap!! but the old man tells me we can't use those rims, they make the car too wide. against the rules. so we go back to 19 inch rims making the car slower again. rules are rules. for all of us. you're just a bad loser who can't accept that.}
<P>__{(tapping head, to marlene)}
<D>__{komm, he's crazy. sick in the head.}
<A>__{niki turns to marlene, speaks in german...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{den trottel lassen wir alleine..}
<P>__{(let's go. leave this jerk alone.)}
<D>__{no wonder she left him...}
<A>__{niki and marlene go. james is left staring. not understanding.}
