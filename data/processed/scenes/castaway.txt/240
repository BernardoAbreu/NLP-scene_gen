<A>__{the raft rocks gently. chuck looks up. the strips of fish are glowing. so is the deck where he killed the fish. he reaches out to touch the fish strips. his hand is glowing too.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i'm an angel.}
<A>__{suddenly he sees other lights. a ship. a ship is out there. and he hears it, a humming in deep register. he waves his hands. he yells.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{here! here!}
<A>__{his voice cracks, we can barely hear it over the ocean. the lights move on.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no...no...no...}
<A>__{his raft is rocked by the wake, rocked hard. chuck is thrown into the water! he comes to the surface, sputtering. where is the raft? he looks one way, then another. darkness. this is the worst. he turns again in the water. there, dimly, he can see the glow from the fish he killed. the glow saves his life. he swims toward it. he pulls himself back on the raft. he lies there exhausted, the glow from the phosphorescence casting a greenish light on his face.}
