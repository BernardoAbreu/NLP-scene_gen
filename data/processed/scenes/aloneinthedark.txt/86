<L>__{interior fischer's lab night 103}
<A>__{the lab is full of sleek, high tech lab equipment and state of the art computers. the room is lit with a humming fluorescent light. surgical equipment and various pieces of high tech machinery buzz by an autopsy slab. surgical tools are laid out on a table. pinkerton's body is laid out on the slab, face down. fischer stands over pinkerton's body. he holds a high tech hand held scanning device. the scanner is connected to a large monitor on a dolly next to the slab. fischer holds the scanner a few inches above pinkerton's body, passing it along the length of him. the image on the monitor matches the movements of the scanner. it shows a real time internal scan of pinkerton's body, displaying the skeleton, internal organs, and so on. visible on the monitor is a spinal worm curled up tight around pinkerton's spine. fischer doesn't look up, but his tone suddenly changes.}

<A>__{carnby stands in the doorway. he waves burke's i d card.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{i'm not here. commander burke is. now what the hell is that thing inside him?}
<C>__{fischer}
<D>__{your curiosity have anything to do with the fingerprint of yours i found on his corpse?}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{the list of people i trust is short, fischer. is it about to get shorter?}
<A>__{fischer turns back to pinkerton's body. carnby comes up and stands next to him. fischer takes a scalpel off the table and makes a careful incision along pinkerton's back.}
<C>__{carnby }
<D>__{have you i d'd him?}
<C>__{fischer}
<D>__{yeah, we got dentals. agent james pinkerton. he's ex 713.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{he was an agent? when?}
<A>__{using tongs, fischer peels back the skin of pinkerton's back. the spinal worm is attached to pinkerton's spine.}
<C>__{fischer}
<D>__{went mia twenty years ago. presumed dead. i'm trying to get more intell, but his records are so classified, they're practically invisible.}
<B>__{c}
<A>__{arnby takes the tongs from fischer, holding open the skin. fischer makes a series of incisions with the scalpel, disconnecting the spinal worm from pinkerton's spine.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{it's fused with his nervous system.}
<C>__{fischer}
<D>__{i've never seen this kind of symbiosis before.}
<A>__{fischer pulls the spinal worm out of pinkerton's open back with a pair of tongs. it hangs limply, motionless. the spinal worm is long and thick, covered with hard, dark scales. it has dozens of tiny clawed feet that were connected to pinkerton's spine. ischer drops the spinal worm in a tub. ischer notices the hand held scanning device is beeping faintly, still registering something. he looks at the read out, curious, then concerned.}
<C>__{fischer }
<D>__{scanner's still reading something...}
<A>__{fischer runs the scanner over pinkerton's corpse. nothing. now fischer looks even more concerned. he turns the scanner on himself, running it up and down his torso. nothing. fischer looks at carnby. carnby gets it. it might be him. fischer runs the scanner over carnby's torso. the scanner immediately starts beeping louder. they exchange a look between them. something's inside carnby.}
