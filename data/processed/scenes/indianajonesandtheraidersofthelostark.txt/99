<L>__{exterior the tanis digs near airstrip day}
<A>__{indy and marion peek out into the light from the shadows of an abandoned excavation. before them is the improvised airstrip serving the digs: a crude runway, a tent supply depot, two fuel tank trucks. down by the fuel trucks a german mechanic is looking skyward. now indy and marion look there too, drawn by the roaring sound of a flying wing, which is circling over the digs in preparation to landing. now a new figure approaches the german mechanic. it is gobler; he yells to the mechanic, indicating the plane.}

<A>__{in the distance, the flying wing lands and rolls toward the men. gobler spins and heads back toward the main camp, which is hidden from view by a rise. indy and marion watch him go.}

<D>__{when the ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on that plane.}
<A>__{the flying wing rolls up into the space near the fuel trucks. the german mechanic puts blue blocks in front of the tires as the engines continue to roar. indy and marion run in a crouch to a hiding spot closer to the plane, near the supply tent. suddenly, a second german mechanic appears behind them. he is as surprised as they are, but recovers quickly and swings a big monkey wrench at indy. indy grabs the swinging arm and the two men tumble out into the open, wrestling. marion remains hidden, moving fast among the crates. the first german mechanic, who is just pulling the fuel hose from the tank truck to the plane, sees the combatants and runs to help his countryman. he is almost upon them when indy puts the second german away with a devastating left right left combination. he turns to find the first german mechanic flying at him. the roll toward the rear of the flying wing and its lethally spinning reversed propellers. in the cockpit of the flying wing, the pilot has been fiddling with his gauges just prior to shutting off his engines. now he notices the fight going on outside. the fistfight between indy and the german mechanic has taken on a new stomach tightening dimension. the men are fighting and flailing in and out between the spinning props at the back of the plane's wings. each man comes within inches of becoming instant mincemeat. the pilot slides away the top of his cockpit and stands up. he pulls a luger from his side and points it, waiting for a clear shot at indy. the german mechanic kicks indy away from him and the pilot aims his pistol. suddenly, marion appears behind the pilot, standing on the opposite wing, and bashes him over the head with one of the blue blocks that was holding the tires. the pilot drops down into the cockpit, his body falling on the throttle. the engines roar louder, revving up. the plane begins to roll, rotating around its one still blocked set of tires. marion grabs onto the cockpit to keep from slipping into the props. she bends into the cockpit, trying to pull the pilot's body off the throttle. no luck. she grimaces and climbs inside. her shoulder bumps the top of the cockpit; it slides tightly shut above her. under the moving wing, indy delivers a knockout rightcross to the german mechanic which sends him staggering back toward a roaring propeller. indy's grimace registers the man's demise and a fine mist of blood wafts toward him. indy spins toward the sound of crumpling metal and sees the other prop of the flying wing slice into a tank truck. the airplane fuel inside floods out onto the pavement, surrounding the plane. indy backpedals away from the plane, his eyes searching the scene for marion. suddenly, he is shocked to see her in the cockpit. he runs toward her, skidding through the gasoline.}
