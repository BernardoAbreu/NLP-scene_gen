<D>__{oh marge.}
<A>__{he puts his hand out to control her. she pushes it away. starts to lash out at him, the frustration too much, so that ripley has to cover his face. maccarron comes off the boat to restrain her. ripley looks at him as if to say: what can you do, she's hysterical. maccarron nods, pulls her on to the boat. greenleaf catches ripley's eye, guiltily. turns away. they stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off towards open waters, passing the little fleets of gondolas.}
