<L>__{interior secret vault moments later}
<A>__{shane scopes out the vault. the walls and ceilings are covered with high tech weaponry. mrs. chun holds julie. bill waits impatiently. shane is figuring his options...}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{anybody got any perfume? hair spray... breath freshener...}
<A>__{a bewildered beat then julie pulls out a tube of binaca. shane squirts it, revealing in the mist a myriad of crisscrossing laser beams. shane steps forward. he speaks aloud, confidently:}
<C>__{j}
<B>__{b}
<C>__{b}
<C>__{shane }
<D>__{zoe, todd, lulu, peter, tyler!}
<A>__{bill reacts, puzzled.}
<C>__{shane }
<D>__{the key is the kid's names. watch.}
<A>__{shane steps forward zap! the floor tile shocks him, sending him flying backwards. bill laughs. shane gets up, in pain.}
<C>__{ill}
<D>__{you think this is a game?!}
<C>__{s}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{but... that was the code! i swear! i saw plummer use it on his briefcase.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{code or no code, go get it now.}
<A>__{ill cocks his gun. sweat drips down shane's face. he mists the air to see the beams: he steps forward, over one beam and ducking under another he miscalculates: a burst of flame blazes from the ceiling like a giant blow torch, shane leaps back, landing on his hands and knees.}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(to bill) you can't make him do this }
<D>__{he doesn't have a chance.}
<A>__{close up shane shane's thinks. he notices a groove carved in the floor, not quite centered to the room. he feels the groove. something she said...}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{haven't got a chance.}
<A>__{shane feels the groove in the floor. he thinks. he looks up at the ceiling (bottom of the first floor).}
<C>__{shane }
<P>__{(sings softly to himself)}
<D>__{... when you're down and low, lower than the floor. and you haven't got a chance. don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the peter panda dance.}
<B>__{e}
<A>__{shane laughs sharply. that's the code! he shares a look with julie. bill and julie share a look they have no idea what he's laughing about. calmness comes to shane's face. he takes a deep breath,}
<C>__{s}
<A>__{facing forwards:}
<C>__{shane }
<D>__{just hop three times like a kangaroo }
<A>__{he hops forwards three times, fearlessly. nothing happens. no booby traps are set off.}
<C>__{shane }
<D>__{sidestep twice, just like the crabs do.}
<A>__{he steps sideway, across two tiles. again nothing happens. it dawns on julie what he's doing. julie smiles, relieved. shane he steps forwards, then back:}
<C>__{shane }
<D>__{three steps forward and one step back.}
<A>__{when he steps back a spring loaded spike launches down from the ceiling, imbedding itself where he was standing. shane is rattled, his focus gone. until julie shouts:}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{quick like a turtle lie on your back!}
<A>__{shane snaps out of it and flops down on his back just in time: flames shoot from both walls right at him. if he'd been standing, he'd be toast.}
