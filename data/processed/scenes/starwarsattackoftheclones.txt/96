<L>__{exterior tatooine, landscape (full moon) night}
<A>__{three different shots. anakin rids the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes. in one shot, he stops and looks down at some tracks. then he starts up his speeder and rides off.}
<L>__{exterior tatooine, desert, homestead (full moon) night}
<A>__{the lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky. somewhere close by, a night animal howls.}
<L>__{exterior tatooine, homestead, courtyard (full moon) night}
<A>__{padme is pacing the courtyard restlessly. she stops, listening to the animal howling nearby. she shivers slightly, then turns and goes into the garage at the side of the courtyard.}
<L>__{interior tatooine, homestead garage (full moon) night}
<A>__{padme stands looking at a speeder parked in the garage. short silence. then:}
<D>__{c 3po please don't leave us, miss padme. these people need your help.}
<A>__{threepio is parked in a corner.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i'm not leaving, threepio. i just can't sleep. c 3po that's something i cannot relate to. as a protocol droid, i'm either active or inactive. there's no in between.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i guess you're lucky. c 3po do you really think so..? i suppose i shouldn't expect...}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{you're not happy here? c 3po oh, i'm not unhappy... and my masters here ar so kind i wouldn't wish to trouuble them, it's just... being like this... well, it's embarrassing.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{being like what? c 3po naked. if you pardon the expression. you see, when master annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering. it's so humiliating. how would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i guess i wouldn't like it at all. c 3po of course you wouldn't. nobody would. it's simply not protocol.}
<A>__{padme looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal and tools.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{maybe we can do something about it. c 3po i don't think so. only master annie...}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{why not? they seem to have a box of old coverings here. c 3po oh? how observant of you, miss padme. of course, i'm just not mechanically minded... if you see what i mean.}
<A>__{padme picks up a piece of metal and holds it against him.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{let's see, if we put this... here... c 3po ooooh! that's tickles.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{you'll have to be quiet, threepio. hold still, please.}
