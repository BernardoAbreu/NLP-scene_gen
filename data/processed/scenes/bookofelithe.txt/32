<L>__{interior palladium guest bedroom dusk}
<A>__{redridge opens the door and ushers eli inside. it's another of the dressing rooms converted into a bedroom, less well appointed than carnegie's own. a threadbare rug. bed with relatively clean sheets. a sink for washing.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{enjoy your stay. there'll be someone outside your room all night. if you need anything.}
<A>__{redridge smirks and closes the door, leaving eli alone. eli paces across the room. finally sits down on the creaky old bed. trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here. he unshoulders his pack, sets it down. lies down on the bed. it's been a while since he felt a real bed on his back. a knock at the door. eli gets quickly to his feet.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{the door opens and claudia enters. carrying a metal tub of water in both hands and, atop that, a dinner tray.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i have this for you. water for washing and some food.}
<A>__{eli just stands there. totally unfamiliar with this kind of situation, it's been too long. she smiles, embarrassed.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{well... are you going to take it?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{oh. thank you.}
<A>__{he takes the stuff from her, sets it on the table.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you're very welcome.}
<A>__{we get the impression that claudia is as unfamiliar with this kind of polite interaction as eli. but she likes it.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{it'll be dark soon.}
<A>__{she strikes a match and lights the oil lamp on the table. the room is lit by its flickering glow.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{can i get you anything else?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{well. have a good night.}
<A>__{as she turns for the door:}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you're carnegie's woman?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{why do you ask?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{just making conversation is all. haven't had one of those in a while. not a real one, leastways.}
<A>__{claudia smiles. neither has she.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{he found me in the outland. i was sixteen, my family had been... well, they were gone. there was just me and my baby.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you had a baby?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'd met some men on the road. bad men. they...}
<A>__{beat. she trails off, struggling with this unhappy memory. eli gets it, raises a hand reassuringly.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's all right.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i was on the road for a year after that. i couldn't feed myself, let alone my little girl. and then bill found us and he promised he'd take care of us. he told me he was going to make a place where we could be safe. and he did. he did all that. he built this whole town. he kept us safe. and he raised that child like she was his own. he's been so good to both of us. he saved us, really.}
<A>__{there's a bittersweet quality to claudia's words. as though there is more to the story than she is telling. eli pulls out a chair at the table, offers it to her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you want to eat some?}
<A>__{she smiles and sits. eli sits across from her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{when did you go blind? in the war? you get caught in a flash?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{no, i was born this way. i think i'm lucky like that.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{lucky?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{it's not like i ever knew what i'm missing. i was already used to being like this by the time... by the time it all happened. so i got around pretty good even when i was on my own. and now it's easy. i know every creaky old floorboard in here, and it's not like i ever go any place else. bill would never allow it. he worries about me so much.}
<A>__{again, bittersweet. the sense that claudia feels trapped. thinking about it begins to upset her. she gets up.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i should go. he'll be wondering where i am.}
<A>__{eli stands, escorts her to the door and opens it.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{thank you. i enjoyed our conversation.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{so did i.}
<A>__{eli closes the door, then sits back at the table.}
