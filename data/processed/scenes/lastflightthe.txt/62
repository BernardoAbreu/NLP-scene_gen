<A>__{cocktail shaker in the hands of an expert who shakes it rhythmically as appropriate latin music begins. this dissolves to a kaleidoscopic view of our protagonists enjoying the night life: nikki's image dominates at the center, surrounded by images of the men in dinner clothes. everyone drinks, except frink who smokes a cigarette and stares, desirous and snakelike, presumably at nikki.}

<A>__{ikki and her war birds (minus frink) seated at a bar in an otherwise empty club late at night, wearing goofy party hats. they swallow a last drink and start to leave laughing, talking, merrily blowing little party horns, taking a bottle or two with them, and waving to an unseen bartender as they go. someone says, "good night." we track in for a closer look at the bar, covered with many empty glasses. and the music and the montage end.}
