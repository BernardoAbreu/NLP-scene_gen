<A>__{the kitchen counter. while her left hand holds the table, her right hand goes to the sog on her belt, her fingers wrap around the blade's grip, lifting it up out of the sheath and plunging it through the table top up to the handle, with all the sog's steel entering vernita's abdomen. the table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker pinned to it. the two former colleagues meet eyes.}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{sorry, bout the bushwhack. please don't...}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{do to your daughter, what you did to mine...}
<P>__{(she takes her hand)}
<D>__{...i won't.}
<A>__{vernita dies. the bride removes her sog, looks up and sees little nikki standing in the doorway of her room. the little girl sees her mother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood. and she sees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife still in her hand. but oddly enough, nikki doesn't cry. the little girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her stare. as she talks to the little girl, she removes an already stained with blood white handkerchief with the name "bill" sewn on it. and the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood off her blade.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{it was not my intention to do this in front of you. for that i'm sorry. but you can take my word for it, your mother had it coming. when you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, i will be waiting.}
<A>__{and with that apology, statement, and invitation, the bride walks out the kitchen side door, leaving the little girl to her mourning.}
