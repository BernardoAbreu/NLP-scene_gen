<L>__{interior dining room afternoon}
<A>__{mrs. collins is seated at the dining room surrounded by friends and family. she fixes one of the many bouquets of flowers on the table. it takes her a beat before she feels the stare. she looks up. standing in the doorway to the dining room is mr. collins. a group of ashen faced guests stand in the distance behind him. husband and wife's eyes meet. mrs. collins smiles softly. mr. collins' eyes tremble with tears.}
<C>__{mr. collins}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{you were keeping her sick...}
<A>__{the whole world stops. the mother's face registers confusion at first. then slow realization. her eyes glace at the many faces around her. she looks back at her husband. his glare is painful. rage filling every cell of his body. tears falling faster down his cheeks. mrs. collins turns her attention back to the flowers. she concentrates with all her strength. beat. her hands begin to shake.}
<C>__{mrs. collins}
<P>__{(to no one)}
<D>__{i took care of her...}
<A>__{her words are met with ice cold stares. the first tears stream down her face. the pretty flowers of consolation in her hand tumble to the floor.}
