<L>__{exterior the sky day the past}
<A>__{as the track continues and we race over the land, flying faster and faster, free as a bird, swooping up towards a huge sun, until the screens whites out and we...}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the sun rising the present ...as the pick up with bob and lyn in the back pulls up next to another truck. two men dressed in black with their kaffiyeh covering their faces stand by it staring at them. in the back seat of the truck sits a blindfolded iraqi man. the driver of the pick up crosses to the two insurgents with a half gallon bottle of water and passes it to them. they drink and confer briefly in arabic. he turns and gestures to the other two young iraqis who push lyn and bob down from the back of the pick up. lyn stands still.}

<D>__{etaharrak!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{lyn?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{it's okay, bob. we're not getting into that truck.}
<A>__{the first young iraqi gestures more angrily at the truck.}
<C>__{young iraqi}
<D>__{edkhol!}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{don't move bob.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(scared, whispering)}
<D>__{are you going to use the blob?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{let's hope it doesn't come to that.}
<A>__{one of the insurgents stirs and says something softly in arabic. the other laughs. angrily the first young iraqi takes out a handgun and levels it at lyn.}
<C>__{young iraqi}
<D>__{edkhol!}
<A>__{lyn raises one hand towards him.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{you can put your weapon away. you're not interested in us.}
<A>__{the young iraqi points the gun at bob who starts to walk towards the truck.}
<C>__{lyn cassady }
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{stay where you are bob.}
<A>__{bob stops.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{shit...shit...}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<P>__{(to the iraqi, calmly)}
<D>__{we can go about our business.}
<A>__{apparently having had enough one the insurgents pulls his own gun out and aims at lyn. the tension builds. suddenly bob remembers the phrase he was taught.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(blurting)}
<D>__{la termi, ana sahafi!}
<A>__{immediately everyone stares at bob. the insurgent opens fire at him. terrified bob, dives across the sand. the young iraqi behind him also scrambles for cover. still firing, the insurgent is suddenly aware of lyn sprinting towards him. before he can turn to aim at him, lyn leaps into the air, spinning around, face contorted as he emits a bizarre shriek. we freeze frame on him, hung in mid air.}
<D>__{bob (cont'd) (v.o.) (cont'd) now at the time i thought lyn was having some kind of fit here. later i discovered what he was actually doing was performing the echmeyer technique.}
