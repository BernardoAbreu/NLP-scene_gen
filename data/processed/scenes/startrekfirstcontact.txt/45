<L>__{exterior montana plains missile silo day}
<A>__{the silo is buried deep underground, but on the surface there is a large, poured concrete missile door. built to withstand a nuclear blast, the door has nevertheless been badly charred and damaged by the borg attack from orbit. there are large, smoking craters all around. part of the ground seems to have collapsed to a depth of ten feet, like a sinkhole nearby. picard and his team approach.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{this must be it.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{how serious is the damage?}
<C>__{geordi}
<P>__{(off tricorder)}
<D>__{i'm having trouble scanning underground. there's a lot of radiation leaking from something.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{probably from the nuclear warhead. cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.}
<A>__{as they speak, beverly pulls out a hypospray and gives everyone injections.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{this will protect us from the radiation.}
<A>__{geordi moves to the thick, concrete missile door, scans it.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{i'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{there should be an access hatch nearby...}
<A>__{everyone spreads out... looking for the hatch. one of the guards lange finds it.}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{over here.}
<A>__{everyone rushes over to him. there's a small hatch on the ground that has been partially hidden by weeds and brush. geordi kneels down, starts working a complex looking lock on the hatch.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{alphanumeric lock. we need a password to get in...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i have the password right here.}
<A>__{picard pulls out his phaser and everyone steps back. he aims and fires at the hatch, which is blown open, revealing a ladder that leads down into the darkness. as they start to crawl inside...}
