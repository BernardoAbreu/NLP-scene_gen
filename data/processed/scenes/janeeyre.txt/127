<A>__{first light. jane is running; flushed, breathless, her dress soaked with dew. she has her bag of belongings over her shoulder. she trips; falls to her knees. she looks back. for a moment she seems paralysed. she returns her gaze to the route ahead. her need to escape is so great that she crawls forwards until she is able to raise herself to her feet. she reaches the stile; lifts herself on to it; puts her arms around the post. she holds it, as if it were beloved. her eyes close. we hear the sound of a winter blizzard.}
