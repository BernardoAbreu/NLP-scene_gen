<L>__{exterior railroad track. day}
<A>__{the chain gang trudges down the track, horses on either side of them, steep banks forming a v for the railroad. a train is coming. brown rides up to the prisoners, herds them off the track. the train approaches quite slowly the boxcars full of wounded soldiers. some of the home guard dismount, take out pipes. the prisoners wait, one of them sits down. sheffield says something to veasey, who casually yanks up the sitting prisoner. inman suddenly understands what's going to happen. the train is almost on them.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{but it's too late. sheffield jerks forward in front of the train, pulling all the others with him, their reluctance tempered by the possibility of being crushed by the oncoming train. somehow the chain gang gets across the track, stumbling and chaotic, the chains yanking tight, then loose, the tight causing a collapse, the loose a recovery. they run alongside the train, blocking themselves from the fire of the guard, sheffield screaming tactics and then, as the train starts to pull past them, they run up the bank, now all as a unit scrambling to the steep summit.}
<B>__{on the other side of the train the home guard have remounted}
<A>__{their horses and are riding hard alongside it. then they have sight of the escaping prisoners silhouetted at the top of the bank like a line of paper dolls stretched out along the ridge. sheffield's yelling with adrenaline, veasey joins in, elated. one of the guards raises a rifle, steadies himself on his horse, fires. he catches veasey, who crumples, spinning round and falling down the bank, until inman uses all his strength and practically lifts him in the air. the chain recovers and works back up the bank. but then a second bullet catches another prisoner and this time the effect is catastrophic the whole gang just flips over and plummets down the bank. the home guard approach, firing randomly at the bodies as they tumble into the ditch by the side of the track. until all movement ceases. inman has a wound to his head which bleeds profusely, almost completely covering his face. brown arrives, considers the carnage.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{get these sacks of shit under the ground.}
