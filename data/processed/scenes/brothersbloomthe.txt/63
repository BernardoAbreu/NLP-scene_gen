<A>__{silent and blue. time slows to a crawl as bloom sails through the air, arcing over the italian luxury car's hood and past a horrified penelope, face frozen mid scream behind the wheel.}
<C>__{bloom }
<D>__{there's actually a knack to this. you want to avoid dying or breaking anything that won't grow back, but you don't want to roll out of it and come up roses. if you're trying to fast track into a mark's sympathies, there's nothing quite as efficient as having your first conversation be from a hospital bed they put you in. i usually like to try for a dislocated shoulder.}
<A>__{several things happen at once. bloom hits the pavement shoulder first, hard. the bent bike follows suit. up on the hill, stephen and the chink raise score cards. 8.9 and 5.6. the lamborghini screeches to a stop. everything is still. then the car jolts forward. then stops. then again, jolts and stops. rolls forward a few feet, lazily drifting, then jolts and stops. bloom painfully stands, as confused by the car's behavior as us. stephen and the chink lower their cards, equally confused. one last long beat of silence, then the car jolts forward, veers drunkenly to the left, tips into a ditch and chunks to a stop. the horn blares. bloom looks up to the hilltop for guidance. stephen stares blankly. the chink raises a new score card }
