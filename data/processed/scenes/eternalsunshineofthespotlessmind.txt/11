<A>__{joel sits on the bench waiting for a train. clementine enters the platform, sees joel, the only other person there. she waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if they're old friends. he waves back, embarrassed. she takes a seat on a bench far down the platform. joel stares at his hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to conceal his awkwardness.}
