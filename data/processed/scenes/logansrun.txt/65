<A>__{another angle 1 the spear points are withdrawn. logan and jessica relieved but shaken, wary.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{may we move?}
<A>__{a long beat. then }
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i saw we pass them through. somebody help holly.}
<A>__{other voices mumble agreement. holly moves off into the dark room, hands reaching out to help her.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{you two. just go straight ahead. follow the corridors with the pipes overhead to the end. then use the key.}
<A>__{as the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground chamber some part of the vast undercellars of the city. the light is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the room, reds and greens both but all are silhouetted, no face seen. there's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's obviously the way they are to go. logan and jessica move off. logan pauses.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{i don't know who you are. i'd like to thank someone.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{it doesn't matter who we are. follow the tunnel to the end.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{i will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?}
<A>__{a murmur of discussion then:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{someone will follow. when you come to the lock, he will tell you how co go on the other side. jessica may go with you as far as the lock.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(a deep breath)}
<D>__{no. jessica goes back now. take her back.}
<P>__{(suddenly his tone is urgent as he speaks to her)}
<D>__{now! go on back. back outside, jessica.}
<A>__{she is bewildered by the change.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{why? no...no...i'm going with you.}
<C>__{voice1}
<D>__{only to the lock. after that there's no way back.}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(small voice)}
<D>__{i don't care. i'm going to sanctuary. with you.}
<A>__{a babble of voices. "impossible"...she ignores, watches logan.}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{will you take me with you?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{why, jessica? you're still a green.}
<A>__{jessica shakes her head. she doesn't know why. logan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand, moved. but suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment. he wheels, pulling her with him.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{come on then they'll be here any minute!}
<A>__{uncomprehending, she starts to run with him. too late. an explosion shakes the chamber the wall bellies inward and a group of sandmen, led by francis, burst into the room, firing as they come. panic. turmoil. people running, screaming the alarm bell ringing, ringing as sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage of the room.}
<B>__{out logan and jessica}
<A>__{as the brief, one sided battle rages, echoing shots and screams in the dust filled room, logan pulls her down out of the way. they watch, helplessly. suddenly the figure of a sandman looms before them. he stares at logan, unsure. logan reacts, draws, fires. the sandman is smashed away, burning.}
<B>__{logan}
<A>__{suddenly aware that he has killed a sandman. jessica pulls him down again into the shadow. neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his crystal can be seen from the room.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{francis, quartering the room like a hound, searching, searching, stopping as he sees}
<B>__{francis p.o.v.}
<A>__{the crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness.}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(believing the blinking crystal is jessica's)}
<D>__{logan. i know you're in here. what've you done...gone crazy over a runner?}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{nobody knows except me. you know i won't say anything. i should have turned you in but i couldn't. leave her. come on out with me. it'll look like you're part of the group that hit this nest.}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{logan...you're a sandman!}
<P>__{(slightest beat)}
<D>__{logan...now...now...logan...}
<A>__{after the slightest beat, logan fires and francis falls, a great chunk of the cave roof falling between him and logan all vision obscured while explosions and screams continue.}
<B>__{logan and jessica}
<A>__{as he pulls her shakily to her feet. she nods, she's okay. he leads her off down the tunnel. with logan and jessica tunnel following the tracks. the way leads down, curves, recurves, but always down. another angle including lock as logan and jessica rush toward it. the corridor has widened into a kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense submarine hatch. the tracks run straight to it and beneath it. the base of the door tands in a couple of inches of water. with great urgency, logan and jessica examine the huge door. logan gives the wheel a tug...nothing. sound: a whirring like clockwork...a metallic bell sound and then a}
<B>__{recorded voice.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{runner, this is the last gate. use your key now. when the bell sounds again...use your key. good luck, runner. may you find sanctuary.}
<A>__{silence. then the bell chime sound and a light illumines the center of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. the whirring continues for about ten seconds. then it stops and the light goes out.}
<B>__{logan and jessica}
<A>__{hearing a sound they turn and see: another angle p.o.v. far behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light and shadow the sound of running}
