<A>__{the queen reaches the river dee, then slows down. she stops and stares. ahead of her is a difficult, quite perilous crossing. he queen composes herself, visibly intimidated. a deep breath, then.. she drives into the fast moving river.}

<A>__{the land rover's engine roars. the jeep rocks alarmingly side to side as it slowly crosses the river. one big rock after another. the queen skilfully negotiates the challenge, and is beginning to enjoy the experience.. but ahead is one rock she hasn't seen.. `crreeak', the land rover's undercarriage hits the rock. the ugly sound of tearing metal. he queen instinctively brakes, then sensing that was the wrong thing to do, slams her foot down on the accelerator. the engine roars in protest, and.. `snap'. an ominous mechanical sound.}

<D>__{oh, you are stupid.}
<A>__{she tries to start the car again, but to no avail. no matter what she does, the land rover is stuck.. the queen looks into the glove box. inside is a mobile telephone. he queen punches in a number..}
