<L>__{exterior side of house}
<A>__{casey it at the back corner of the house.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i can hear you. i know you're here.}
<A>__{casey eases along a narrow path between a tall fence and the side of the house...going for the front yard. she must pass the three curtainless windows. she gets to the first one and peeks in... the figure has pulled open the foyer closet, searching for her. casey creeps along, to the next window, she looks in...the figure is completely on the other side of the room moving toward the hall that leads to other parts of the house. she moves further along the house...squeezing by hedges...to the third window...she peeks in to the figure...}
<B>__{staring back at her...}
<A>__{his face covered with a ghostly white mask, inches from her...his eyes piercing through...soulless...casey screams bloody murder as a hand... crashes through the glass window grabbing hold of her neck...she beats at him trying to free herself...her nails dig into his arm...she wrenches from side to side...finally breaking free as the hands disappear inside the house...}
