<A>__{clutching his throat, he comes across the others standard and hunter and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping like fishes out of water. they are sweating heavily and their noses bleed. they try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can only hear distant croaks. standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall. the others follow him.}
<L>__{interior main air tank room}
<A>__{the door bursts open and standard reels in, his footsteps pinging thinly on the metal flooring. we see several rows of large oxygen tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks. standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening them. there is a piercing hiss of escaping air, and the sound level gradually returns to normal as standard and the others sink to the floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully. finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up.}

<A>__{standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges.}

<D>__{does anybody know what happened?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{i saw it. faust got himself jammed in the air lock door. his body held it open.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{can we get to him?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{no, i had to seal off a whole section. we'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.}
