<A>__{a shot rings out, and pedro's chest explodes in front of us. sudden panic, rage, confusion the sandinistas whirl and scan the building. p.o.v. oates racing across the cathedral rooftop into the night. price grabs pedro's gun and whirls to face the church; his action is instinctive, angry, and electric with energy. claire grabs pedro's arm and drags the body to safety, though there is no safety and the body is lifeless. her actions are protective and automatic. the sandinistas take control of the situation and move quickly. two of them fan out to cover the escape. price screams in the direction of oates,}
