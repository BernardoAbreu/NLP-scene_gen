<C>__{malcolm's voice}
<D>__{today, with thousands of others, i proclaimed god's greatness in the holy city of mecca. wearing the ihram garb i made my seven circuits around the kaaba; i drank from the well of zem zem; i prayed to allah from mt. ararat where the ark landed. it was the only time in my life that i stood before the creator of all and felt like a complete human being.}
