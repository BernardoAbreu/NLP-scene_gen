<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{oh, hell...}
<A>__{she spots wyatt and starts toward him but he looks away, as if ignoring her. she stops. behan steps up to her, tipping his hat, very gallant. they move toward the bar. wyatt turns to doc.}

<D>__{hamlet, dear friend, the supreme role of any actor worth his salt.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(leans in, points to wyatt)}
<D>__{here's a man you should meet, mr. fabian. excellent character study for you, the real life actual melancholy dane.}
<C>__{fabian}
<D>__{indeed, sir? how so?}
<C>__{doc}

<D>__{come on now. we don't want any trouble in here. not in any language.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{evidently mr. ringo's an educated man. now i really hate him.}
<A>__{ringo looks at doc, holding his gaze while suddenly whipping out his .45. everyone but doc flinches. ringo does a dazzling series of twirls and tricks, his nickel plated pistol flashing like a blaze of silver fire, finally slapping it back into his holster with a flourish. cheers and hoots. doc rolls his eyes, hooks a finger through the handle of his silver cup, then launches into an exact duplication of ringo's routine using a cup instead of a gun. the room bursts into laughter. doc shrugs. ringo lets a strange little hint of a smile cross his face then exits with the others. white exhales, turns to wyatt:}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{see what i mean about it getting spooky?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{curly bill, huh? who was that other idiot?}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{ike clanton, old man's eldest son. know he ain't got the stuff, makes him miserable.}
