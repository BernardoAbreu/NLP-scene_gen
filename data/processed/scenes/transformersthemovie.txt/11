(design note: autobot city looks like a federal energy project gone mad. here, the autobots are trying to exploit every known means of getting energy. the mountain is covered with solar panels, windmills spin in the valley, oil derricks pump, and not far away a hydroelectric dam catches millions of volts. near all of these various things are energon compressors, which turn the raw energy into energon cubes. in the background of these scenes, we should see various panel truck type autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this energon, convert to humanoid mode, load up their vans, then convert to auto mode again and drive the energon into autobot city. in short, it should be clear that the purpose of autobot city is to harvest energy. all the while, hot rod and daniel are riding recklessly out from the autobot city and up into neighboring hills for an overview of the }
