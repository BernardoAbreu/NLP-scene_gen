<L>__{int day: carlo's living room (1955)}
<A>__{the door opens, and the grim party enters.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you fingered sonny for the barzini people. that little farce you played out with my sister. did barzini kid you that would fool a corleone?}
<C>__{carlo}
<P>__{(dignity)}
<D>__{i swear i'm innocent. i swear on the head of my children, i'm innocent. mike, don't do this to me, please mike, don't do this to me!}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{barzini is dead. so is philip tattaglia, so are strachi, cuneo and moe greene...i want to square all the family accounts tonight. so don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.}
<A>__{carlo is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(almost kindly)}
<D>__{don't be frightened. do you think i'd make my sister a widow? do you think i'd make your children fatherless? after all, i'm godfather to your son. no, your punishment is that you're out of the family business. i'm putting you on a plane to vegas and i want you to stay there. i will send connie an allowance, that's all. but don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry. who approached you, tattaglia or barzini?}
<C>__{carlo}
<P>__{(sees his way out)}
<D>__{barzini.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{good, good. leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport.}
<A>__{carlo moves to the door; opens it. there is a car waiting; with a group of men around it. he looks back at michael, who reassures him.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i will call your wife and tell her what flight you're on.}
