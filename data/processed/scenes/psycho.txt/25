<A>__{mary in car (night) the oncoming headlights hurt mary's eyes. she is getting sleepy and her vision is blurring. her eyes close, involuntarily, snap open again. she stretches than wide, as if forcing them to stay open. the oncoming lights seem to glare to a point beyond endurance. she murmurs "sam sam."}

<A>__{we see mary's car, dim in the early dawn, tilted on the soft shoulder of the road, looking somehow sad and pathetic, like a child's thrown away toy. and from this angle it would appear that the car is empty. after a moment, during which there are no other vehicles passing, we see, coming from the far distance, a highway patrolman in a patrol car. he passes mary's car, notes its apparent emptiness, u turns, comes back up behind the car. he gets out and approaches the driver's side window.}
