<L>__{exterior willow pond day}
<A>__{julianne and michael walk the gravel path beside a breathtaking pond, ringed with willows that dig heavy branches to the water's surface. he is relieved, reflective. head down, he never notices that she is... ... dangerously freaked. too petrified even to hyperventilate, we're lucky she's breathing at all. we watch her life unraveling before her glassy eyes.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(never looks up)}
<D>__{thank god you were here.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(mumbles to herself)}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{well, it happens.}
<A>__{they pass an expanse of lawn which has become the event parking area. family vehicles, delivery trucks, service vans. everything that couldn't fit on the circular front driveway.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i might have thrown away...}
<A>__{searching for the right words.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{... your one chance for true happiness?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{... yeah, that.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{you never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover. as they say in the sport biz.}
<A>__{there's a vague stepford wife quality to her voice. he hears that now, and looks at her. maybe he can't tell she's frightened. but he can tell she's something.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<A>__{she stops walking. she can't look at him, so she looks around. across the lawn crews are moving equipment into the brightly colored tents, unfolding and setting up stacks of tables and chairs, raising the poles between which all those balloons will be strung. at the center of it all... .... a huge topiary white sox batter, just completing a murderous swing. he's maybe fifteen feet tall. she points to it...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{the big hurt, huh?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{nellie fox. walter likes the past. and he likes the little guys.}
<A>__{so julianne nods. because she does too. squints up at michael.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{got a minute?}
<A>__{he nods, you bet. worried for her. what is this? she looks in another direction, and we now see that we have nearly reached... ... a stage that's been set up for the band. chairs, music stands, sound equipment. a gleaming dance floor, already in place over the lawn. next to it, a shimmering white gazebo. like the centerpiece of a wedding cake.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{why is the dance floor by the gazebo?}
<A>__{she takes his hand. they walk toward it.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{kimmy's idea. she thought it would be such a romantic place. for our wedding dance.}
<A>__{looking down at her.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{shhh.}
<A>__{up the white steps now. together. the gazebo floor has been covered with hardwood. the perfect place. for a wedding dance. and julianne... ... turns, suddenly. he almost runs into her. she is staring up at him, so strangely, their bodies only inches apart. he is caught, transfixed by the intensity in her eyes.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i have to say this quick, okay, or i will have this massive coronary and you'll never have to hear it. which you need to. does that make any sense at all?}
<A>__{the coronary part does. we can feel her heart beating from here.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{jules, what's wrong...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{this is the dumbest thing i will ever do. so dumb, in fact, that i can't. i don't think.}
<A>__{and then, she does. she puts her hands flat on his chest. looks in his eyes.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{michael, i love you.}
<A>__{a heartbeat passes.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i've loved you for nine years, but i was too arrogant and scared to realize it. now i'm just scared.}
<A>__{he stares at her, dumbstruck. she moves even closer.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i know this comes at an inopportune time, but i have to ask this one really gigantic favor, okay?}
<A>__{holds her breath. and...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{choose me. marry me. let me make you happy.}
<A>__{and in a half beat of excruciating silence...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i know. it sounds like three favors.}
<A>__{his eyes are loving. they care for her. she swallows, lost in them.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{but when you think about it...}
<A>__{slides her arms around his neck, and raises her mouth... ... to his. the most beautiful kiss she will ever offer. all of her heart is in this, and as his hands touch her body... ... a scream rips the world to pieces. they whirl to see... ... kimmy, halfway up the path. her hands across her mouth, as if to stem the horror that pours forth as she shrieks from her soul, and... ... runs. back down the path. michael bolting after her, shouting her name. a frozen moment, and... ... julianne takes off after him. all three running, screaming their various emotions at the top of their lungs, as workmen stop to watch from neighboring countries. kimmy, staring from halfway there, has an insurmountable lead. leaps into her convertible and peels out, just tearing up the gravel as she rockets out of sight. no way to catch her. still... ... michael is racing for the cars. julianne, sprinting her guts out, losing ground with every stride. michael jumps into a cherokee...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{michael, don't, you'll never catch her!!}
<A>__{he grinds the gears. she keeps running. his engine fires.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{she has too big a lead and she drives like a rabid animal!!!}
<A>__{he blasts off. she keeps going. gasping for air, clutching her side, she's dying here. slams into a florist's truck, looks inside, shit! next, a butcher's van, looks inside, jesus!}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(to the world at large)}
<D>__{doesn't anybody leave keys anymore? whatever happened to trust??}
<A>__{up ahead, michael has stalled the cherokee. she still has a chance, dashes to the next van. bornstein extermination, a handsome rendering of a rat above the toxic materials warning flings the door open. stumbles in. keys!}
<C>__{julianne }
<D>__{thank god, a samaritan!!}
<A>__{michael speeds away. she kicks the ratmobile in gear. lurches off.}
