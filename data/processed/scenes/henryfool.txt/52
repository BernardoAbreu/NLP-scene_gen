<L>__{interior world of donuts day}
<A>__{fay comes walking up through the parking lot with simon's notebooks and a pile of typed papers. she's a wreck; tear stained face and a ball of tissues gripped in her hand like a weapon. she throws open the door to the world of donuts and looks around. the place is crowded with teenagers hanging around like it was a cafe or student union. fay sniffles tragically and falls on the counter.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{gnoc, gimme a value pack of kleenex, will ya?}
<A>__{gnoc gets the kleenex while fay overhears two kids near simon's poem...}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{the violence of the imagery reminds me of early clash, while the lyricism of the verse recalls, for me, walt whitman.}
<C>__{bibi}
<D>__{i would have said dickinson, maybe even eliot, and so on. but i agree with the punk roots...}
<A>__{fay pays for her tissues and makes her way to the back of the store where she finds simon with henry, who is holding forth to his friend and the small coterie of high school students surrounding them...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{the greats all say the same thing: little. and what little there is to be said is immense. or, in other words, follow your own genius to where it leads without regard for the apparent needs of the world at large, which, in fact, has no needs as such, but, rather, moments of exhaustion in which it is incapable of prejudice.}
<P>__{(drinks)}
<D>__{we can only hope to collide with these moments of unselfconsciousness. this divine fatigue... this...}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(sitting)}
<D>__{push over.}
<A>__{henry takes the typed manuscript from her and continues...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{as i tried to make plain in paris: 'nous savons que nous avons chute parce que nous savons qui nous sommes.' 'we know we have fallen because we know who we are.'}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(skeptically)}
<D>__{when were you in paris?}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(interrupted)}
<D>__{that's beside the pointerior but did they listen to me? of course not!}
<A>__{fay blows her nose and simon is concerned.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{you alright, fay?}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(lighting a cigarette)}
<D>__{no, i'm not alright! your poem brought my period on a week and half early! so just shut up. everybody just shut up!}
<A>__{she drops her head to the table and cries. henry and simon look on in silence. then henry continues...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{for is this not the best of all possible worlds? are not the evils of this world necessary components of a cosmos that could not exist without them?}
<A>__{amy's girlfriend, chris, leans forward studiously and asks...}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{so, do you believe in god?}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(smokes, shrugs)}
<D>__{unfortunately.}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(lifting her head)}
<D>__{yeah, but when were you in paris?}

<D>__{at. one. time.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{simon, can i have your autograph?}
<A>__{simon looks from her to henry. henry winks at him.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{go ahead. but never let yourself be flattered.}
<A>__{simon signs the girl's book.}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(to henry)}
<D>__{so what about this friend of yours, hot shot? the publisher.}

<P>__{(reminding him)}
<D>__{angus james.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{yeah. angus james. how about sending this poem to him?}
<A>__{henry seems a bit put upon.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{because it's not done yet.}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(to simon)}
<D>__{when's it gunna be done, simon?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{well, you oughta be home writing instead of hanging out over here with all your groupies.}

<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(continues)}
<D>__{the thing to do is to send parts of it to different magazines and literary journals first. that kinda thing. you know. substantiate it.}
<C>__{amy}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{what's 'scatalogical' mean?}
<A>__{henry sips his beer and looks at her.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{filth, child. a preoccupation with excrement. why?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{that's what the board of education called simon's poem, yesterday; scatological.}
<A>__{henry reaches across the table and shakes simon's hand.}
