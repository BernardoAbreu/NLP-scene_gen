<L>__{interior outpost launch tube night}
<A>__{barnes remains on guard duty with the rpg, propped up on some cushions, a lantern by his side it's pretty late, the generator's shut down. he's reading an old, yellowed comic book, he has a small stack at his side. marcus' voice echoes up from below, startling him.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{hello? anyone there?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm thirsty.}
<C>__{barnes}
<P>__{(snickering)}
<D>__{want some motor oil?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i need water.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{bullshit. machines don't drink.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{please, i'm }
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{shut up, robot!}
<A>__{barnes returns to his reading. he reacts to footsteps from the long corridor into the living area behind him. blair approaches with a flashlight, her manner conciliatory.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{how's it going, barnes? thought you might like a late night snack.}
<A>__{she pulls a crumpled plastic package out of a pocket of her flight suit ancient hostess snack cakes. barnes' eyes light up as he puts the rpg aside and grabs it.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{where in hell'd you get these?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{we got a stash back at the base.}
<A>__{barnes tears open the package hungrily, takes a bite. he grins, but as he chews, his expression darkens.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{kinda stale.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{you need something to wash it down.}
<A>__{from another pocket, she produces a plastic water bottle filled with a murky gray liquid.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{i'm on duty, you know.}
<A>__{so saying, he takes the bottle, unscrews the cap and takes a long pull. it's powerful hootch, he gasps for air, passes her the bottle as she sits beside him. she doesn't drink.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{twinkies and moonshine. you trying to seduce me again?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{you know i always liked you, barnes. i just didn't want to join the harem.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{what can i say? it's our duty to repopulate the planet.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{noble of you to make the sacrifice.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{c'mere.}
<A>__{he pulls her close to him for a kiss. after a moment, she pulls away and moves to the corridor entrance. there's a large sliding steel door here.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{i prefer a little privacy.}
<A>__{with some effort, she pulls the door closed. barnes rises with a grin, undoing his shirt, coming close to her. he's already unsteady on his feet.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{you're so twentieth century...}
<A>__{he puts his arms around her for a full body embrace }
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{admit it, i'm the best you ever had...}
<A>__{his words are slurring. he slides to the floor, slowly losing his grip. he rolls onto his back with a drugged out expression of bliss on his unconscious face.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{men. you're all talk.}
<B>__{in the bottom of the pit}
<A>__{marcus leans against the wall in the dark, rolls out of the way as the ladder drops. blair descends quickly, the flashlight in her belt, a battery blade saw in one hand. she sets the flashlight on the ground and moves to his side }
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{i used up the last of my valium for you... hold out your arms.}
<A>__{he does, she fires up the saw, moves it carefully to the bolt joining his forearms. sparks fly from the buzzing blade as it digs into the metal it's going to take some time.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{i don't believe you're a terminator.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{so what am i...?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{whatever you are i owe you one. once you're free, i will lie down next to barnes they'll assume you escaped while we were passed out }
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you think they'll buy that?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{worth a shot.}
<P>__{(looking at him)}
<D>__{marcus, command wants to take you apart, cut open your head. one thing i know, you're alive and you've got a right to live.}
<A>__{the buzzing saw blade sound bridges to:}
