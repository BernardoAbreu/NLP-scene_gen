<L>__{exterior colorado wilderness plane crash site day}
<A>__{a frenzy of activity, as several dozen treasury agents sift through the snow for the wreckage of the ct 39, some taking photos, some taking videotapes, some putting the pieces into bags for analysis. many bags. many small bags.}
<B>__{wider on crash site}
<A>__{the treasury plane has been completely pulverized by the crash and its subsequent explosion there are few pieces here that aren't charred, and fewer still that are any larger than a paperback book.}
<B>__{wright}
<A>__{unhappily walks through the carnage and past agents gathering up the plane, to a harried crash specialist from the faa ross stuart (40s) who is organizing the debris.}
<C>__{wright}
<D>__{what can you confirm?}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{well, sir it crashed. that, i can confirm.}
<P>__{(condescending)}
<D>__{we've been here just about one hour. these events take months to analyze. so if you'll excuse me }
<A>__{he walks away but wright, pissed, spins him around.}
<C>__{wright}
<D>__{no, i don't think i will. the reason the faa pays you is to exercise your vast, amazing knowledge of these "events". so i expect you to come up with some stunning insights, something a slow witted fuck like me hasn't already observed.}
<P>__{(gesturing to wreckage)}
<D>__{one: it didn't blow up in mid air, because the debris isn't widely dispersed. but was there a bomb on board that could have disabled it? i wonder.}
<P>__{(pointing back)}
<D>__{two: there wasn't an attempted landing. otherwise, there'd be debris to the east of the wreckage, where the plane was coming from. did it come straight down? that's got me scratching my head too.}
<P>__{(gesturing back to wreckage)}
<D>__{and three: the flight recorder's tracer led us here in the first place. so where is the goddamn thing? that one's got me all aflush with curiosity.}
<C>__{stuart}
<P>__{(a little cowed)}
<D>__{you'll be the first to know.}
<C>__{wright}
<D>__{oh, i believe you.}
<A>__{wright storms off as agents delicately handle debris.}
