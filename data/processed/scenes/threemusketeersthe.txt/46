<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior dungeon night}
<A>__{a chamber in hell. spiders the size of rats, rats the size of small dogs. a foul stench in the air. d'artagnan is sprawled in a corner, unconscious, on a filthy matted floor. the sharp tip of a sword pokes him in the chest. d'artagnan wakes with a start, springs back into action. as if he was still battling jussac at the carmes deschaux. he slaps the sword away, leaps to his feet, and reaches for his own. but it is gone.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{my sword }
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{it's magnificent. where did you get it?}
<A>__{rochefort steps into view, the familiar eyepatch, admiring d'artagnan's sword in his hands.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{it belonged to my father.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{your father...}
<A>__{rochefort studies d'artagnan for a long moment, then...}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{well now it belongs to me. i collect swords. i take them from the men i kill.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i'm not dead yet.}
<A>__{d'artagnan starts forward. but rochefort raises the sword, points it at his throat. d'artagnan freezes, feels the sharp tip of the blade.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{soon enough.}
<A>__{rochefort shoves d'artagnan back to the floor with a heavy boot. a beat. d'artagnan peers at his dismal surroundings.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{where am i?}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{i will give you a hinterior it's not the louvre.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{the bastille! i'm in the bastille!}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{well, you're the first person who was ever happy to be here. unfortunately, your visit will be a short one.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{you killed one of the cardinal's guards. an offense punishable by death.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{he interrupted a duel i was fighting.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{also punishable by death.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{it was a long day.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{you know them?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{the musketeers.}
<A>__{d'artagnan says nothing. he will not betray them. rochefort leans close.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{tell me where they are, and i will be lenient.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{rochefort}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{i will give you your father's sword.}
<A>__{a long beat. d'artagnan eyes the gleaming saber, forged in the crusades. he nods, gestures for rochefort to come closer. as if to impart a secret. rochefort tilts downward, d'artagnan rises up... and whispers.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{give me my father's sword, and i will cut out your heart.}
<A>__{bold words, bad timing. rochefort snarls, slams the hilt of the sword into d'artagnan's head. the youth slumps from the wooden stool to the floor, unconscious.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{fool. like your father.}
<A>__{rochefort storms from the cell. he nods at a grizzled jailer on his way out, indicates the chains and manacles on the cell wall. the jailer scurries over to d'artagnan, inert in a shallow puddle of foul water. he lifts, drags him toward the chains but d'artagnan's eyes pop open, the jailer reacts with surprise, and...}
