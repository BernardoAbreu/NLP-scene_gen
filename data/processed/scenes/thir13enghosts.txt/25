<L>__{exterior house}
<A>__{an enormous and majestic house made of glass nestled amongst pine trees. stark against the evening sky, the house is awe inspiring. even for an english teacher, arthur has a hard time finding the words. there's also a power & light truck parked in front.}

<A>__{a young man appears, waiting in the solitary light of the porch, a clipboard in his hand and a tool belt slung over his shoulder. he's dressed in a power & light uniform, and on closer inspection we see that it's rafkin, in disguise. he approaches the family.}
