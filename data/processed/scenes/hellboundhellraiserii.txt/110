<L>__{interior corridors labyrinth}
<A>__{kirsty, tiffany and larry are running, tiffany making the decisions as to direction. down one corridor, blades and knives jut out from the opposite walls at random intervals and they have to weave at high speed between them. they negotiate the corridor successfully but, just as kirsty, bringing up the rear, emerges from it, she stumbles and half falls. the re structured box falls from her pocket and rolls back a few feet up the corridor. tiffany, who is nearest to her, helps her to her feet and, as she does so, catches sight of the box (or white diamond, as it is now). she makes as it to go and get it. kirsty holds her arm.}

<D>__{no. come on. we have to get out of here.}
<A>__{tiffany moves away with kirsty, but not without a backward glance and a puzzled expression. they all make another turning. suddenly, when they are about halfway down this next corridor, a new gap opens up behind them in the wall and a terrible sucking noise is heard. corridor debris disappears into the vacuum. luckily, larry has reached the end of the corridor and grasps the corner with one hand, seizing kirsty's hand with the other. kirsty grabs tiffany and the three of them flatten themselves against the wall, fighting against the suction. the force is tremendous and larry's finger are slowly losing hold.}
