<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{a shadow of a man can be seen hiding. peter does not notice him.}
<L>__{interior peter parker's apartment night}
<A>__{there's a knock at the door.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(crossing to it, wondering)}
<D>__{peter...?}
<A>__{she is about to open the door when four waldos smash through it, obliterating it. ock stands in the shattered doorway, waldos writhing.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{doctor octavius...! you're... you're...}
<P>__{(finds the words)}
<D>__{you're so weird!... with those... what do you call those...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{waldos... did you hear about spider man?}
<P>__{(moving waldos like spider's legs)}
<D>__{that's me... the real spider man... now tell me, where is that jerky friend of yours... parker?}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(protecting)}
<D>__{peter?... oh... he's not here. he's gone. i don't think he'll be back for awhile.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(running his waldo in her hair)}
<D>__{you wouldn't lie to your professor now, would you?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{of course not. why would i lie about a thing like that? really. he's... out.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{we'll wait. ock grabs liz's hair with his waldos.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{what are you doing... let me go! please... take those things out of my hair!}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{my waldos, you mean.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{whatever you call them... please...}
<A>__{ock shoots out two waldos. simultaneously each grabs a chair from different parts of the room and brings them to the table.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{sit.}
<A>__{she does. he does, too, and folds his waldos across his chest.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(chatty)}
<D>__{he's a nice boy. a little nerdy maybe, but nice, wouldn't you say?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{oh, i don't know. maybe. he's very inexperienced.}
<A>__{one of ock's waldos rests on the table curled around the computer. liz lets her hand rest on it. ock warms immediately.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{you know, you're a fascinating young lady...}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{thank you...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{you're so refreshing. you're so...}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{shocking...?}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(gone to far)}
<D>__{oh, i wouldn't say shocking...}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i would!}
<A>__{she sticks his waldo in the electric wall socket behind the computer! the current sizzles through him and he leaps up, waldos akimbo, like the "cartoon cat." liz runs out the door. ock extricates himself from the current and gives chase.}
