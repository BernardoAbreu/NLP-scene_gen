<L>__{exterior mckee's rocks night}
<A>__{close on: a small, electronic unit, the size and appearance of a "game boy". an led screen shows a blinking red dot moving along a map.}
<C>__{riley }
<D>__{turn left up here.}
<A>__{slack, driving the t bird now, makes the turn. the car blows through a deserted town, moving fast. riley notices that slack is effected by the desolation she sees.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{how long since you been out here?}
<C>__{slack}
<D>__{never been out. lived in the city since...it was a regular city.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{pull over.}
<C>__{slack}
<P>__{(surprised) huh?}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{you said you were going to make yourself useful. right now what i could use is for you to pull over.}
<A>__{he does. the t bird stops along a road bordered by a marsh thick with tall cat tails. unexpectedly, riley stands and points his automatic at pillsbury and manolete.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{i made a deal with your boss. find cholo. i'm gonna do it. keep him from blowing up the green. i'm gonna do it, i don't want people to get hurt. bring back dead reckoning... sorry. that's where i stop. i didn't ask him for much, just guns, ammo, and a car. i've got the guns. i've got the ammo. and if i find dead reckoning i'm gonna have the best fucking car that's ever been built, and i'm taking it to canada. if any of you don't like that idea...}
<A>__{riley reaches down and opens the passenger door. manolete looks out and sees the cat tails moving. three walkers are slogging through the marsh.}
<C>__{manolete}
<D>__{some choice.}
<C>__{pillsbury}
<D>__{good choice. i like see canada.}
<A>__{pillsbury reaches out and slams the car door closed again.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{charlie, keep these two covered.}
<A>__{charlie pulls his .45. riley turns around his seat, glancing down again at the "game boy" in his palm. the red dot has moved on to another map.}
<C>__{riley }
<D>__{take a right onto route six.}
<A>__{slack pulls out.}
<C>__{slack}
<D>__{this is what you were thinking about all along. you got me out here figuring i'm a boy scout, and now you're telling me we're just stealing a fucking car?}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{you have a problem with that?}
<C>__{slack}
<D>__{no. i like the way you think.}
<C>__{harlie}
<D>__{i like the way he thinks, too. just look at me you can tell i like the way he thinks.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{take another right.}
<C>__{slack}
<D>__{how do you know which way you're going?}
<A>__{riley holds up the "game boy". it beeps softly as the red dot shifts onto another map.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{i built a homing device into dead reckoning. if cholo's anywhere within fifty miles, we can track him.}
