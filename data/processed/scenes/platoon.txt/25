<L>__{exterior chris' position night}
<A>__{chris jerks awake very suddenly, very frightened. the rain has stopped. the jungle sounds are loud. cicadas, night animals, water dripping hypnotically from leaf to leaf. and the whirr of a million mosquitoes out after the rains, chewing at chris' face. he looks around, startled. tex is asleep. junior is asleep. what happened? he looks at his watch. the mosquitoes are eating him alive. he buries his head in his green towel which he wears around his neck, but he can't see. a beat. he moves again, miserable from the bites. another beat. then suddenly the sounds of the jungle shift some of the animals dropping out. a different tone. a piece of wood is stepped on, a rustle of bush ... chris sees something, lifts an edge of the towel to peek out. a shoadow of a figure is frozen there in front of him about 15 yards. it looks like a man. but it doesn't move. at all. it listens. chris, his heart in his mouth, tries to peer through it. it's a bush. it has to be. no human being could stand that still. his heartbeats are up. the moments take forever. but deep down somewhere in his psyche he knows who it is. the figure now shifts, ever so slightly and moves. it is a human being. oh my god! chris looks around. tex seems like a mile away. why doesn't anyone fire! he casts a desperate look at his rifle, at his grenades encrusted with mud, but in spite of all his training, he is frozen with indecision and fear at the sight of his enemy. the figure seems to whisper something back, then turns and comes down the trail. now a second and third figure appear behind him all in helmets and packs. all coming right past chris' position. ten yards. nine. chris is rigid with terror. stark eyes. pleading with tex to wake up, but out of reach. he is about to have an anxiety attack, his heartbeats so far up he is sure they will hear him. the first figure is now directly in front of chris on the trail, looking left and right. a rattle of his equipment, a creak of leather. a smell. the man's face now catches the moonlight and his eyes come around on chris. oriental eyes. looking right at him. startled. chris staring back, hypnotized. it all happens very fast. the figure murmurs something in vietnamese. a warning. he swivels. a flash of muzzle fire. a raking cough of automatic fire. a grenade explosion. chris is hurled to the ground, helmet bouncing off, scattered, confused, jarred. all hell breaks loose around him with noise and shouts. tex, kissing the ground, is yelling at him.}

<D>__{the claymore! get those fuckers!}
<A>__{chris, not knowing what he's doing, is fumbling with the claymore handles, presses them. insert: they won't give. he tries again and again to the squeeze the life out of them. tex is screaming at him.}
<C>__{tex }
<D>__{the safety! take the safety off you ...}
<A>__{lunges over and grabs the handle from chris. clicks the safeties off and blows them. three explosions rip out into the night and one of the enemy is caught in a brief instant looking like an x ray, his body lifted and swirling in the air, then enveloped in swirls of smoke. chris, trying to keep up, grabs his m 16, lays out a stream of fire. the sound all around him is deafening.}
