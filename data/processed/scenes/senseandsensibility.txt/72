<L>__{interior barton cottage parlour day}
<A>__{elinor and mrs dashwood are at the accounts. willoughby and marianne are on the other side of the room in the window seat, whispering together. clearly, he is already part of the family.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{surely you are not going to deny us beef as well as sugar?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{there is nothing under tenpence a pound. we have to economise.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{do you want us to starve?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{no. just not to eat beef.}
<A>__{mrs dashwood is silenced but sighs crossly. elinor looks over to the lovers and sees willoughby in the act of cutting off a lock of marianne's hair, which he kisses and places in his pocket book. elinor is transfixed by this strangely erotic moment. willoughby senses her gaze and looks over. she snaps her head back to her sums and is astonished to find that she has written 'edward' at the top of the sheet. hastily she rubs it out and writes 'expenses'.}
