<L>__{interior forney house late afternoon}
<A>__{tj enters the house, which is quiet except for the sounds of a tv. there are no lights on so it feels dark. he walks past the tv room, the tv is on. dad is on his back, fast asleep, mouth wide open. he barely seems alive, until he makes a small whimper. his mouth closes, he swallows, then his mouth drops open again. tj picks up the remote control from a mess of empty pill bottles on the coffee table and switches off the tv. tj walks past the kitchen and drops his backpack.}
