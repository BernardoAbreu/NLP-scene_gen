<L>__{interior car day}
<A>__{mathilde's sunglasses reflect the alpine landscape.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{you picked a beautiful spot.}
<A>__{she takes off her shades. her once hazel eyes are now grey blue. she glances round the hire car's drab plastic interior.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{you would be hard pressed to make a fast get away in this.}
<A>__{perhaps she's nervous. her attempt at humour isn't working and she stumbles slightly on her grammar:}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{i would have thought you to have had at least an alfa romeo.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this attracts less attention.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{is it far?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fifty minutes.}
<A>__{she looks up through the sun roof at the high mountains over head.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{up there?}
<A>__{jack nods. she eases herself back, resigned to a long climb.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{the train was tiring. one has to keep alert so much in cities.}
<A>__{her eyelids are drooping.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will wake you before the turn off.}
<A>__{she smiles gratefully. but does not shut her tired eyes. the clock on the dash reads 12:17}
