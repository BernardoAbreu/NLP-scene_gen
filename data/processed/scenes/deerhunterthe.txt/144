<L>__{interior nick's trailer night}
<A>__{nick sits on the bed in the back part of the trailer. his hunting gear is piled on the floor, the lights are out and he is staring at the telephone which is illuminated through the window by a street light on the corner. there is a sound outside, then the lights come on as linda enters with groceries.}

<C>__{linda}
<D>__{that's wonderful. i think you should... fresh air.}
<A>__{nick gets to his feet, suddenly. his face is twisted with pain and his voice is cracked with emotion.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you know how sometimes you're going along... you're going along... and that's all...! one thing is right after another, like steps... and you step along.}
<A>__{nick can hardly breathe. it is as if he were choking.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{i don't know where that is... it's gone! that's gone!}
<A>__{a car pulls up outside. the horn begins blowing, then vince and albert begin pounding on the wall of the trailer.}

<D>__{let's go!!!}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{hey! fuckin' a! time to roll!!!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i gotta go.}
<A>__{nick swings his pack on his back, picks up his rifle and heads for the door. linda follows, still clutching her groceries, her emotions so pulverized she can't even speak.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{i will be... i don't know... couple of days.}
<A>__{nick is gone. linda stands motionless, clutching her groceries, staring at the trailer door. it is dark outside. snow is blowing in. the door closes slowly, with a faint hiss, and then clicks shut.}
