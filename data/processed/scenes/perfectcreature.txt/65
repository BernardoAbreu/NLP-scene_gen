<L>__{int: brotherhood building, bio containment ward }
<A>__{day establisher pov continues. there are 3 beds in here. in them, strapped down, 3 young woman. they are all insane, monstrous; the whites of their eyes are blood red. we see silus observe them, but there is no horror in his eyes, just compassion. he moves to one of the woman and slowly grasps her hand. she lurches towards him.}
<C>__{professor liepsky}
<D>__{if she wasn't restrained she would try to kill you. don't worry, it's only transmissible through their blood. we designed it that way.}
<A>__{silus quietly turns to the professor.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{designed?}
<C>__{professor liepsky}
<D>__{genetically designed. edgar was experimenting with the virus that created you. it was sanctioned by the government.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{since when do they sanction such things?}
<C>__{professor liepsky}
<D>__{since not one brother has been born in 70 years. and never a female of your kind from which we could breed. and we need to breed more brothers. you give the world hope. to the people you're like gods walking the earth.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{this is what edgar was doing silus. trying to genetically control the birth of brothers.}
<A>__{silus is now turns back to the poor creature on the bed.}
<C>__{professor liepsky}
<D>__{and edgar was successful. each of these women carried a brother, for a time. but, the virus... changed. most of them have died and these will die soon.}
<A>__{silus places his hand on the poor creature's head, blessing her.}
<C>__{professor liepsky}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and edgar may be the first brother to ever die.}
<C>__{professor liepsky}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{before that, his brain will wither like these women. containment will be the issue.}
