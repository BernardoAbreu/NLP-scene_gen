<C>__{erin}
<D>__{hey, ross. tell me something. does pg&e pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?}
<C>__{ross}
<P>__{(a bad liar)}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{the fuck you don't. no one calls me pattee. that heavy breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{people are dying, ross. you got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it. i wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.}
<A>__{ross is speechless. he just stands there. erin drags the box to the floor and goes to work.}
