<L>__{exterior street and bonaventure hotel night 11:07 p.m.}
<A>__{it is the mother of all parties. in an aerial shot we see there must be 100,000 people jamming the closed streets of downtown l.a. arc lights sweep the sky. there are two outdoor bandstands, with live music pounding. there are lasers, strobe lights. people are literally dancing in the streets... if they can move at all. huge projection video screens are set up all over the place. la is connected to other cities all over the world by satellite, sharing in the celebration in different time zones. the excitement has been building all evening as midnight sweeps across the country toward the west coast. it looks like a u2 concert 10 blocks long: a multimedia blow out. madness in the streets. and lenny and mace are stuck in it. the civic can't move in the middle of this millennial mardi gras. people swarm around, pounding on the civic as they go by, or press their faces against the glass. it may be the party of the century, but it looks like the middle of a third world revolution.}

<D>__{that's it. let's bail.}
<A>__{and she's out of the car, leaving the keys, ignoring the protesting horns behind her. and we see that she's wearing a short black cocktail dress. lenny comes around the car, through the wild crowd. he's in his other suit. snappy. mace unselfconsciously hikes up her dress and slips her .380 auto into a holster velcroed to her leg. she pulls the dress down and you can't see the gun, hidden between her upper thighs. in fact, it looks like she couldn't be concealing a quarter anywhere on her body. the dress is cut low at the top and high at the bottom, showing plenty of muscular legs. high heels doing great things for her calves. her braids now loose and full, like a mane. lenny glances at mace and does a double take. he is caught by a sudden realization:}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{mace... you're a girl.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{good, lenny. i can see why the detective gig didn't work out. come on.}
<A>__{they push their way through the swirling mass of humanity. mace moving like a wedge, security training coming to the fore. the whole street is vacuum packed with people. filled with cars deserted in the general euphoria, an unparted red sea of man and machine. they will move through the various strata of society as they work their way in to the party's inner sanctum. it is like all of la, from poorest to richest, compressed into a few square blocks. there are cops everywhere. cops on motorcycles, cops in cars, cops in riot gear. lenny scopes out the security at the front entrance... metal detectors, cops... plus you have to have a 500 dollar a plate ticket.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{got your ticket?}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{no. they must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.}
<A>__{lenny motions toward the back of the hotel and mace follows. they pass a uniformed cop who is standing thirty feet away, his back to them. reverse angle: it is spreg. his black eyes scan the crowd.}
