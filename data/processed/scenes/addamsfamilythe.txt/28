<A>__{tully alford, the family attorney, and his wife, margaret, approach "gate," a wrought iron monstrosity that opens of its own accord. though tully comes here often and margaret has been here before, they never cease to be startled by "gate." tully has a puffy, once handsome face, and an embittered grey aura that is the mark of a middle age misspent. high strung and superficial, margaret is more disap pointed in tully than he is in himself. margaret passes through gate first. then, as tully passes through, gate slams on him, clipping him and catching the end of his coat. tully fights gate for his coat.}
