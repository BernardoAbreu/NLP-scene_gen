<L>__{exterior bridle path gittes & cross}
<A>__{walking toward the main house. a classic monterey. a horse led on a halter by another ranch hand slows down and defecates in the center of the path they are taking. gittes doesn't notice.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{horseshit.}
<A>__{gittes pauses, not certain he has heard correctly.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{i said horseshit.}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{horseshit.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{yes, sir, that's what it looks like. i will give you that.}
<A>__{cross pauses when they reach the dung pile. he removes his hat and waves it, inhales deeply.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{love the smell of it. a lot of people do but of course they won't admit it. look at the shape.}
<A>__{gittes glances down out of politeness.}
<C>__{cross}
<P>__{(continuing; smiling, almost enthusiastic)}
<D>__{always the same.}
<A>__{cross walks on. gittes follows.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(not one to let it go)}
<D>__{always?}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{what? oh, damn near yes. unless the animal's sick or something.}
<P>__{(stops and glances. back)}
<D>__{and the steam rising off it like that in the morning. that's life, mr. gittes. life.}
<A>__{they move on.}
<C>__{cross}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{perhaps this preoccupation with horseshit may seem a little perverse, but i ask you to remember this. one way or another, it's what i've dealt in all my life. let's have breakfast.}
