<L>__{interior soundstage day}
<A>__{the interior of stage c is completely filled by the laboratory set. electricians adjust the lights on the wooden tower beside the bride's table. colin clive (dr. frankenstein) and ernest thesiger (dr. pretorius) sit off to the side, in full makeup and costume. clive mumbles earnestly over his script. thesiger pinches his face over the needle he dips in and out of an embroidery ring. whale comes on the set with elsa on his arm. she walks regally beside him, the train of her long white robe thrown over one arm. there's a wolf whistle from overhead, and applause, causing elsa to curtsy to her admirers. thesiger takes her hand, leans back to study her.}
<C>__{ernest thesiger}
<D>__{my god. is the audience to presume that colin and i have done her hair? i thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.}
<C>__{ernest thesiger}
<D>__{oh no, my dear. you look absolutely amazing. there's no way i can compete with you. the scene is yours.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{in the sequel, james, two lady scientists should make a monster. and our monster would be gary cooper.}
<C>__{ernest thesiger}
<D>__{i would've thought mr. leslie howard would be more your line.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{more your line.}
<C>__{ernest thesiger}
<D>__{my line nowadays runs to rin tin tin. dogs are so much more dependable than men.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{colin? please. it's time.}
<P>__{(softly, to thesiger)}
<D>__{how is he today?}
<C>__{ernest thesiger}
<D>__{stiff as a board.}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{yes, colin. come see what they've done to our elsa.}
<A>__{clive walks over, glumly.}
<C>__{colin clive}
<D>__{i'm not at my best today, jimmy. a touch of flu, you know.}
<A>__{whale sees through the excuse, rests an arm on clive's shoulder.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{relax, my boy. you could do this scene in your sleep.}
<A>__{clive grits his teeth and nods. whale positions them in front of the upended table, clive and thesiger holding elsa's robe out by the hems. the shadow of the sound boom passes back and forth while they rehearse.}
<C>__{ernest thesiger}
<D>__{i gather we not only did her hair but dressed her. what a couple of queens we are, colin.}
<A>__{elsa giggles. clive looks distraught which brings some life to his stiffness. whale sees this, decides to tune it higher.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes, a couple of flaming queens. and pretorius is a little in love with dr. frankenstein, you know.}
<A>__{clive's distress reads clearly now. he is twitchy and alive.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes. i think it's coming together. shall we have a go?}
<A>__{he sits in the canvas director's chair, nods to the assistant director.}
<C>__{assistant director}
<D>__{quiet on the set!}
<A>__{the warning bell rings.}
<C>__{assistant director}
<D>__{lights!}
<A>__{the lights sizzle and blaze.}

<C>__{assistant director}
<D>__{camera!}
<A>__{a young man with a clapboard steps in front of the camera.}
<C>__{camera assistant}
<D>__{scene two fifteen. take one.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{action.}
<A>__{the bride snaps her head in various directions. thesiger slopes back, fingers splayed, intoxicated by his creation:}
<C>__{ernest thesiger}
<D>__{the bride of frankenstein!}
<A>__{whale sits with his legs crossed, jogging his raised foot as if conducting the scene with his show. fully engaged, intensely alive. we cut to:}
