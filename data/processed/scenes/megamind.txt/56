<A>__{pat cocks back the chamber of a .357 magnum. he holds it up and carefully takes aim...at hal's chest.}
<D>__{"pat morita" trust me.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{what are you doing!? "pat morita" an invulnerability test. something wrong?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{uh...yeah. i would prefer not to get shot. do not fire that thing!}
<A>__{frustrated, pat lowers the gun.}
<D>__{"pat morita" you're bulletproof.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{okay, do you know that for sure?}
<A>__{pat quickly aims and fires. hal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets off his chest.}
<D>__{"pat morita" i do now.}
<A>__{hal looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{you suck.}
