<A>__{under a crisp and starry night, a man and a woman sit around a campfire. as we move closer we see that the woman is marcella reading, "women who run with wolves." she tends to s'mores on the campfire, assembles one, and hands it to monty, her young outdoorsman boyfriend. monty is perched on a small boulder, engaged in a tai chi like ritual, wearing patagonia's finest. there is a path of crystals leading from the fire to the boulder. in the background is a tent and a nissan pathfinder. monty's watch goes off.}
