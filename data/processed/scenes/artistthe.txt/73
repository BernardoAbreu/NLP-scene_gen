<D>__{in a pawnshop, george, still a little drunk, is selling his tuxedo. the pawnbroker and he are visibly disagreeing on the price, but of course it's george who folds first and hands over the tuxedo. the pawnbroker counts out the bills and hands them to george who, in a fit of pride, leaves a tip as he leaves his dignity intact even in the face of adversity.}
