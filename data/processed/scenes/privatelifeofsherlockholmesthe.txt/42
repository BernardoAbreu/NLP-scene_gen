<L>__{interior holmes' bedroom day}
<A>__{gabrielle is asleep in holmes' bed, covered by just a sheet, and obviously naked underneath. holmes is not in the room. mrs. hudson comes up behind watson, in the open doorway, peers over his shoulder.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<P>__{(scandalized)}
<D>__{well, i never!}
<A>__{there is the sound of the hall door opening, and they both turn.}
<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{holmes breezes in, carrying a large suitcase, with leather straps around it. tucked under the straps is a white parasol. and attached to the handle of the suitcase is a cardboard tag with the number 301 on it, in green.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(inhaling deeply)}
<D>__{mmmmm. i smell porridge. lumpy as usual, i suppose.}
<A>__{he sets the suitcase down on the couch, as watson and mrs. hudson approach.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{oh, there you are, holmes. we were just wondering how }
<P>__{(points from his bedroom to holmes')}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<P>__{(sternly)}
<D>__{we certainly were.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{mrs. hudson, why don't you go down to the kitchen get a towel and wipe that look of disapproval off your face.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<D>__{liberties in my house!}
<A>__{she exits huffily.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you can't really blame her i mean, the way it looks if i didn't know you better, i might suspect you'd taken advantage of the young lady.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, i did take advantage of her... would you hand me the butter knife, please?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{he picks up the butter knife from the table, suddenly turns back with a delayed reaction.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you did what?}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(taking butter knife from him)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he starts to pry open the locks of the suitcase with the butter knife.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(spluttering)}
<D>__{holmes, this is reprehensible! where are your professional ethics? have you no sense of decency, no shame }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{none whatsoever. if you must know, i found her body quite rewarding.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you cad!}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{especially the palm of her right hand.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i'd rather not hear about it!}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{very well. then i won't bother to tell you how i traced her suitcase.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{that's her suitcase?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{remember that piece of soggy cardboard with our address on it? it was a luggage ticket the number rubbed off on her hand. and since she must have arrived from brussels by the boat train, i concluded that she had checked her belongings at victoria station.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{by jove! if you're right, we should find a clue to her identity.}
<A>__{holmes has now forced open the locks.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{or at least a pink negligee with maribou feathers.}
<A>__{he opens the suitcase, lifts out the top piece of clothing, holds it up a pink negligee with maribou feathers.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{voila!}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{let's see what else is in here?}
<A>__{they start sorting through the clothes in the suitcase. holmes removes a tied bundle of letters.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{now we're getting somewhere.}
<A>__{as he examines the envelope, watson takes out a framed photo of a rather attractive man of fifty.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{who do you suppose this is?}
<A>__{gabrielle appears from holmes' bedroom wearing holmes' dressing gown. she is unsteady on her feet and somewhat dazed. holmes looks up.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{come in, madame valladon.}
<P>__{(gabrielle stops)}
<D>__{you are gabrielle valladon.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(holding up photo)}
<D>__{and this is your husband, emile valladon?}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{her eyes fall on the open suitcase.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{sorry to have ransacked your valise. but since you came to us for help }
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{where am i?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{221b baker street.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{oh, yes...}
<P>__{(a beat, as she orients herself)}
<D>__{which of you is mr. holmes and which is dr. watson?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{dr. watson is the handsome one.}
<A>__{watson, pleased, twirls the end of his mustache. gabrielle sways slightly.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{that's the way he affects most women.}
<A>__{he helps her into a chair.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(to gabrielle)}
<D>__{coffee. you want strong coffee.}
<A>__{he hurries over to the breakfast table.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{it's all so confusing.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{let's try to sort it out. you came to london looking for your husband...}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{yes. he's a mining engineer. we were married five years ago, in the congo.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{where your husband was working in a copper mine.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{how did you know?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{your wedding ring it's made of copper.}
<A>__{he picks it up from the chemistry table, hands it to her. gabrielle starts to put it on.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{last year he invented a new kind of air pump, and was hired by an english company, jonah limited.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(handing her cup of of coffee)}
<D>__{here you are.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{jonah limited. go on.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{we've been writing to each other regularly. then suddenly, three weeks ago, his letters stopped. i kept writing ... but no answer. finally i decided to go to that address }
<A>__{she indicates the bundle of letters. holmes glances at the return address on the back of the envelope.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{32 ashdown street.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{yes. it's just an empty store nobody there. then i tried to find jonah limited. no such company exists.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{how decidedly odd.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{madame valladon, can you think of any reason why your husband should have lied to you about theses things?}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{emile? never. he loves me and i love him.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{so i gathered.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{i went to the police they said they would send out a missing persons report but they didn't sound too encouraging. then i went to the belgian embassy and explained the situation to them and they suggested that i consult you...}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you could have done worse.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{i was on my way here and suddenly there were footsteps behind me and a hand over my mouth and the smell of choloroform and the next thing i knew i was in the water and then a man was wrapping me in a blanket }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{madame valladon, somebody tried to kill you last night. do you have any idea who could have done it?}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{i don't understand any of it.}
<P>__{(rises, goes to holmes)}
<D>__{what does it all mean, mr. holmes? where is my husband? you must help me find him.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{we'll do our best, i assure you.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{madame valladon, i want you to send one more letter to your husband.}
<A>__{he crosses to the desk, picks up a sheet of paper and an envelope, then leads gabrielle over to the chair with the writing arm, seats her in it.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{to emile valladon ashdown street what was that number?}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<P>__{(addressing envelope)}
<D>__{32. what do you want me to say in the letter?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{he folds the blank sheet of paper, and as gabrielle finishes addressing the envelope, he inserts the paper in it, starts to seal it.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you're sending an empty sheet of paper to an empty shop?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{that empty shop is obviously being used as an accomodation address, or letter drop. but what gets dropped must be picked up. the question is how? and by whom? and why?}
