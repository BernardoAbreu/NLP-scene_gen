<L>__{interior cheap motel room day}
<A>__{danny and jimmy standing there looking at something off screen. danny and jimmy looking at one another, then back at what they were looking at. a guy sitting on the bed in his underwear, looking down at his left arm and holding a can of bug spray at the ready in his right hand. he is completely motionless, studying his arm with hypnotic intensity.}

<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{with bobby you thought you could fuck?}
<A>__{danny and jimmy wait silently. bobby finally stops spraying, satisfied he has killed the imaginary spiders. he looks up at jimmy and danny, his eyes swimming with stupid, drug addled confusion.}

<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{come on. ease off the girl.}
<A>__{bobby springs from the bed, grabbing something as he rises. danny and jimmy suddenly staring at a speargun which is loaded with two stainless steel spears. bobby stands there alternately pointing the speargun at jimmy, then danny.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{did you bring the plastic men?}
<A>__{bobby nods towards something behind danny. danny and jimmy don't move or speak.}
<C>__{bobby }
