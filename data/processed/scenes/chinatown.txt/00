<A>__{written by robert towne full screen photograph grainy but unmistakably a man and woman making love. photograph shakes. sound of a man moaning in anguish. the photograph is dropped, revealing another, more compromising one. then another, and another. more moans.}
<C>__{curly's voice}
<P>__{(crying out)}
<D>__{oh, no.}
<L>__{interior gittes' office}
<A>__{curly drops the photos on gittes' desk. curly towers over gittes and sweats heavily through his workman's clothes, his breathing progressively more labored. a drop plunks on gittes' shiny desk top. gittes notes it. a fan whiffs overhead. gittes glances up at it. he looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite the heat. never taking his eyes off curly, he lights a cigarette using a lighter with a "nail" on his desk. curly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his fist into the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does. he starts to sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos of several movie stars askew. curly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees. he is weeping heavily now, and is in such pain that he actually bites into the blinds. gittes doesn't move from his chair.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{all right, enough is enough. you can't eat the venetian blinds, curly. i just had 'em installed on wednesday.}
<A>__{curly responds slowly, rising to his feet, crying. gittes reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of more expensive whiskeys. gittes pours a large shot. he shoves the glass across his desk toward curly.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{down the hatch.}
<A>__{curly stares dumbly at it. then picks it up, and drains it. he sinks back into the chair opposite gittes, begins to cry quietly.}
<C>__{curly}
<P>__{(drinking, relaxing a little)}
<D>__{she's just no good.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{what can i tell you, kid? you're right. when you're right, you're right, and you're right.}
<C>__{curly}
<D>__{ain't worth thinking about.}
<A>__{gittes leaves the bottle with curly.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{you're absolutely right, i wouldn't give her another thought.}
<C>__{curly}
<P>__{(pouring himself)}
<D>__{you know, you're okay, mr. gittes. i know it's your job, but you're okay.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(settling back,}
<D>__{breathing a little}
<P>__{easier)}
<D>__{thanks, curly. call me jake.}
<C>__{curly}
<D>__{thanks. you know something, jake?}
<C>__{gittes}

<D>__{i think i will kill her.}
