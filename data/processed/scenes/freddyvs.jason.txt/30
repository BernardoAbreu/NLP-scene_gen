<A>__{jesse is waiting for meagan as she emerges from the nurse's office, muttering under her breath:}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{old witch... what does she know? she isn't even qualified to give a shot and she's telling me that my dreams aren't anything to worry about.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{so she said you were okay?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{oh, sure... madame curie in there says it's just a case of heat pro stration and an overdose of tv news. ruined my makeup, too.}

<D>__{so you're going back to class?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{no. she gave me last period off.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{well, what are you bitching about? i could have a compound fracture of the skull and she wouldn't excuse me from p.e.}
<C>__{meagan}

<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{okay... well, didn't the nurse say it was heat probation?}
<A>__{meagan rolls her eyes in frustration.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{you don't understand... i want to know more about dreams. what they mean... why we have them.}
<C>__{jesse}
