<C>__{john}
<D>__{yes! exactly! well put! teach me that word sometime. i can really use it.}
<A>__{she nods..there is almost a moment of relaxation..then the anger fires an immediate need..she leans across the seat to deliver an urgent message to him. the words come out exponentially too forcefully.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{i quit this job!}
<A>__{his spontaneous and forceful reaction surprises her..}
<C>__{john}
