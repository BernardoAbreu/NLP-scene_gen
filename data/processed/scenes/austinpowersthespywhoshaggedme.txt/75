<D>__{yes, and we're starting to pick up the signal now.}
<A>__{basil hands felicity a tracking device that beeps.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{how did you get close enough to plant a homing device?}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{i shagged him, i shagged him rotten.}
<A>__{austin and basil are confused and grossed out at the same time.}
<C>__{austin}
