<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{arms broker, man without a face. veteran of baader meinhoff and the red brigades. he's rumored to be based in the u.s. doesn't travel much, they say. too afraid of metal detectors, the poor sod's got a foot long piece of steel in his leg.}

<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{come again?}
<C>__{nathan}

<D>__{where the hell...? i know i just heard that somewhere, something about a...}
<A>__{his eyes widen:}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{oh, fuck.}
<A>__{points to the lake:}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{nathan, that son of a bitch has one in his leg.}
<A>__{nathan freezes, thoughts racing... swears violently:}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{you blithering idiot, the son of a bitch wasn't her lover, he was her target, he's daedalus!}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{oh, jesus...! that's how she knew all that shit, not from dating him she studied the fucker to take him out!}
<A>__{he takes off for the lake at a dead run. behind him, the bloodied nathan drags himself to his feet and lurches off the porch, stumbling. weaving. refusing to go down. at the lakeside luke walks behind samantha. talking softly in her ear, smiling... she hears something. a ratcheting noise, drawing closer, hmmm...? looks up. wishes she hadn't a bell ranger helicopter is descending over the lake. inside, timothy shoulders a bolt action rifle, coolly professional. fires, kicks up dirt at henessey's feet. stops the fucker cold. on the shore, luke smiles at samantha, says:}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{sure don't look like an ambulance, does it?}
<A>__{slugs her in the face. drops her to the ice like a broken doll.}
