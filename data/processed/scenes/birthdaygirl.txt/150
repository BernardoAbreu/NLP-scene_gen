<L>__{interior car day}
<A>__{john is turning the pages in his road atlas. he is trying to drive and map read at the same time. nadia is looking out of the window. soon a big tear rolls down her cheek. she starts to cry. john glances up from his map but ignores it. but she keeps crying. he tosses the map in the back, pulls the car to the side of the road and switches off the engine. as nadia cries, john gazes impassively out of the window. this goes on for almost a minute, until nadia pulls herself together, when without looking across john restarts the engine and pulls away.}
