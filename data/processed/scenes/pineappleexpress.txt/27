<L>__{exterior forest continuous}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{i always liked smoking weed in the forest.}
<A>__{saul lights a joint and starts smoking. he passes it to dale. dale puffs. they look around at their expansive, dark surroundings and immediately become overwhelmed with paranoia. saul notices a shooting star zip across the sky as dale takes out his cell phone.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i'm going to go call angie. make up some bull shit.}
<A>__{as dale dials, saul, paranoid from the pot, looks at his cell phone. he takes another hit, and then looks up to the sky again. he looks back at dale's phone. dale starts to walk off.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{dale...wait!}
<A>__{saul snubs out the joint and runs over to dale.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{yeah, the phone...i mean, i don't know how this shit works, but...can cops... you said they might be cops...could they triangulate our phones or trace `em or some shit like that? i don't know. i feel like i've seen that.}
<A>__{dale stares at saul, then flips open his phone beep}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{i mean, shit dale, maybe they can trace them when we're not even on them!}
<A>__{dale takes a hit as he looks up to the sky. just then, a loud rumbling noise is heard.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{what the fuck is that?!}
<A>__{the rumbling gets louder.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{are we on fucking "lost"?! what the hell is that?!}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{it's them!!!}
<A>__{the noise builds to a deafening crescendo as the guys dive behind a tree stump. a moment later, a jumbo jet buzzes overhead, heading towards the nearby airport. dale and saul pop up.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{holy fuck. that was close.}
<C>__{dale}
<P>__{(clutching cell phone)}
<D>__{you know what? you're right. we should just get rid of them. we should just smash `em.}
<A>__{dale looks at his phone, which is a new, expensive razor.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{fuck. i just bought this thing. maybe i can just take the batteries out?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{no! smash it!}
<A>__{dale sighs, then smashes his phone on a rock. saul looks at dale, then hurls his phone into the woods as hard as he can, sending it sailing into the forest.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{shit!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{what the fuck was that?!}
<A>__{dale tosses the joint aside.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{fuck! i was trying to throw it at that tree!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{what tree?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{that one.}
<A>__{saul points out a group of trees about 30 feet away.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{it was a cheap piece of shit. came free with the plan. it must've smashed when it landed.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{who the fuck knows?!? i don't know!! why couldn't you have just smashed it on a rock like a normal person?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{i was trying to smash it! how often does a guy smash things? i'm rusty. fuck.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{did you at least see where it landed?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{over there, somewhere. wait! we could call it!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{with what? i just smashed my phone!}
<A>__{they look into the scary dark depths of the woods. both of them are clearly terrified.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{man, it's not like they got mcguyver workin' on the case. i bet they can't even triangulate it.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{well, then you shouldn't have said anything, cause now you've convinced me that they can!}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{fine! fine. let's just find the stupid thing and get back to doing what we were doin'.}
<A>__{horrified, they cautiously inch into the forest.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{do you see it?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{dude, this is the scariest place i've ever been in my life.}
<A>__{they nervously walk on.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{you ever see that movie where all the people are in the woods and they slowly get killed?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{the "blair witch project."}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{no...shit. that one's way scarier than the one i was thinking of. mine had arnold shwartzenegger in it. now i'm thinking of the fucking blair witch.}
<A>__{they inch forward, nervous.}
<C>__{dale}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{they both freeze.}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{what }
<C>__{dale}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{sshh!}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{what is }
<C>__{dale}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{sshh! can you hear that?}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dale}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{just listen.}
<A>__{saul listens.}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i literally hear nothing.}
<P>__{(gasp)}
<D>__{wait...}
<A>__{suddenly, saul sprints off into the darkness!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{saul!!!}
<A>__{dale looks in horror as saul vanishes amongst the trees.}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(screaming in pain)}
<D>__{arghhh!!!}
<A>__{dale hears a loud thud. scared for his life, he sprints in the opposite direction! he weaves in between the trees, avoids some rocks and tree roots, stumbles on some loose dirt, then slams half his body against a tree and falls hard. angle on: saul saul gets up, covered in dirt. panting, he looks around the forest and sees no one. he thinks he hears something and sprints off! wham! he trips on a tree root and slams into the ground. angle on: dale dale stumbles to his feet while futilely trying to wipe the dirt off his suit.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{saul hears dale and whips around, breaking a twig crack dale looks towards the noise, then sprints off. saul hears someone and bolts in the opposite direction. like chickens with their heads cut off, they both scramble through the woods trying to evade their imaginary enemies. dale spots his car! he jumps in and slams the door shut. he's about to turn the ignition, but stops. panting and wheezing, he sinks into his seat. bam! something slams into the car.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{aaaaahhhhhhh!!!}
<A>__{dale sees saul banging against the passenger side door.}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(muffled through the window)}
<D>__{let me in! let me in!}
<A>__{dale unlocks the car and saul jumps in.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{let's go! go!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{is there anyone even out there?!?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{i don't know!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{if you don't know then why the hell did you run like that?!?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{i don't know! i'm freaking out, man! let's just go!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no! we're not going anywhere!}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{but there could be something out there!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{there's nothing out there, that's why we're here. god, man, you scared the fucking shit out of me.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{well, i'm not getting out of the car. i'm staying in the car.}
<A>__{a moment of silence. they both look around. there is clearly nothing out there. dale turns on the car. talk radio comes on.}
<C>__{radio dj}
<D>__{ white accent walls would go nice with a dark colored room, say a burnt sienna, but don't forget...}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{talk radio? you fuckin' joshin' me? why don't we just shoot ourselves in the nuts?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{shut up, okay? it's my car.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{fine. well, i'm going to smoke a joint before i go to sleep, and don't worry about it, even though you're being a dick, it's on the house.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{don't do me any fucking favors. i got my own.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{thanks to me!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{dale and saul start rolling separate joints.}
