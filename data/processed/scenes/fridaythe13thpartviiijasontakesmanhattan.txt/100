<L>__{interior bridge night}
<A>__{as mcculloch tears open a cabinet door labeled emergency flare gun. the siren continues to blast.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{can you shut that damn thing off??}
<A>__{sean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around for the appropriate switch. miss van deusen sees mcculloch remove the flare gun from the cabinet.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{we already thought of that nobody could possibly see it in this storm...}
<C>__{mcculiach}
<D>__{there's only one person who needs to see it. and i'm going to find him.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{what about the fire??}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{i doubt very much that one even exists.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{use some common sense! setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting jason voorhees is on board.}
<P>__{(resolved)}
<D>__{enough is enough.}
<A>__{he marches out the door. sean finds the alarm kill switch, flipping it. the excruciating siren vanishes. he grabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to miss van deusen.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{we have to get everybody together just in case the fire's for real.}
<A>__{sean heads for the door, shoving it forward.}
