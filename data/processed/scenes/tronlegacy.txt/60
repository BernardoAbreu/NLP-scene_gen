<L>__{interior obsolete computer game arena}
<A>__{circular, riddled with memory leaks. rush hurries to the center. no sign of tron.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{tell me, tron! who programmed you? here's your encryption code! 3 6 2 6 6 8 }
<A>__{rush sends data coursing into floor circuits. it radiates up walls, across bridges... and finds tron in hiding. data races into tron's body. six code numbers engage; he glitches. he leaps to breaks the contact, flinging his disk tron's disk slams rush. rush tumbles off a ledge, dangling over a memory leak. tron pounces in. snags his disk. tron steps on rush's hand. pain energy jolts rush's circuits.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{arrgghhh! 3 6 2 6 6 8 7 }
<A>__{rush slips, grabs a slim protrusion. feet zapping an inch from the memory leakage. tron throws his disk for a final time. it arcs wide, coming around directly at rush. tron leans down, gazing into rush's eyes.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{362668766!}
<A>__{burst of searing data surges off rush's hands, radiating up circuitry, loading into tron's body. all nine code numbers lock in. tron's body seizes. he fights the data intrusion, but his circuits sequentially shut down. tron's airborne disk wobbles and darkens. tron tumbles off the edge, plummets past rush. disk misses rush, skates into darkness. mega, krod and i beem hurry in and see: rush, climbing to safety. and below: tron's body slips into the memory leakage, zapping away to bits.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{you got him!}
<A>__{but mega looks dreadfully worried. she slips away... krod and i beem climb down and help rush to his feet.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{game over, dude. i beem you crashed him!}
<A>__{rush gazes off the precipice. remains of tron is consumed by the swamp of memory leakage.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{it's more than i wanted. now i will never know who his user is.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{we're heroes! i beem i will be upgraded!}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{they'll give us a slot in the main server! i beem i will be upgraded! i will be }
<A>__{krod slams him, makes him stop.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{rush, now you can finish pinging mega's eprom!}
<A>__{rush looks around.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{where is mega? i beem she was just here.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{right behind me.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{mega??}
<A>__{rush searches. he finds tron's disk, picks it up. it's dark and lifeless, circuits gray.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{mega...}
<A>__{sounds echo around them. coming fast. electro metallic footsteps. rush, krod and i beem bunch together and pivot. black clad finity fighters appear, blocking all exits. disks ready for attack. rush double takes on faces among them: quantz, tall silent, hardcore (looks like real world phlegman) and boole, rotund, seen it all (like real world kelter).}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{i recognize... trouble. i beem they're scanning us.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{i beem, go for help. zap your butt out of here.}
<A>__{but i beem freezes, terrified. fighters tighten perimeter. a hush. footsteps. clunk zap... clunk zap.}
<C>__{dark figure }
<D>__{it had to happen. but why now of all times?}
<A>__{rush and krod turn. fighters defer to: a dark figure, limping forward, one leg badly deformed by data corruption.}
<C>__{dark figure}
<D>__{a user shows up.}
<A>__{rush is surprised, then pleased. somebody finally gets it.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{yeah, i'm a user. a superior being. the first to enter this realm. and you are ?}
<A>__{figure's circuitry lights. finally, we see the face... it is flynn.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{the first.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{flynn. how can you be here?}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{you know this dude?}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{yeah, he's a lunatic!}
<A>__{i beem panics, zaps away in an energy beam. he reforms further along for a "breath", then zaps further away. three finity fighters chase him. rush is amazed to find him self in the presence of encom's former leader. flynn comes closer, recognizing rush.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{rush nortebi. i remember hiring you.}
<A>__{they are equally dumbfounded.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{somebody tipped these guys off about us.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{not soon enough.}
<A>__{fighters step aside, mega enters, furious at rush.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{you weren't supposed to beat tron. i thought for sure he'd finish you.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{you destroyed our last hope!}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{i detect a pattern in her behavior.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{she's a spy.}
<A>__{mega and rush ooze mutual contempt. rush turns on flynn.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{no wonder i couldn't figure it out. i assumed tron user was on the outside! if i'd known this, i would blown past him and come straight for you.}
<A>__{flynn yanks tron's disk from rush, peers over the precipice. below, the last of tron is consumed by memory leakage. flynn ponders tron's lifeless disk. he falters on his bad leg. mega throws an arm around to help him stand. melancholy energy courses between them.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{i failed our cause.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{you did everything you could.}
<A>__{they know each other well. rush registers jealousy, but larger concerns prevail:}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{flynn never died...}
<P>__{(dawning)}
<D>__{because your quantum digitizer worked. that's how you got here... i know that's how i got here too.}
<A>__{flynn studies rush, anger rising.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{the day after i hired you, you start sucking up to sinclair. you thought i didn't know. bet he offered your a partnership for this, right? you have no idea the damage you've done.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{i'm only getting started. man, you were the company joke. now i see why. you melted down your lab to take this little joyride. you got stuck here so all you can do is wreck other people's hard work.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{open your eyes, geek. my lab was rigged. my "death" was no accident. i pushed the button just in time to escape... almost in time.}
<A>__{he indicates his deformed leg. mega, krod and the others listen with awed bewilderment. these two guys speak of a world unknown to them.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{you're paranoid. who would want you dead?}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{the same guy i programmed tron to shut down. same one you've been sucking up to. sinclair. and his cyber henchman, plexor.}
<A>__{malicious grumbles from fighters.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{too many of your brain cells have gotten zapped in here, old man.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{rush, you lamer! you've been working for the bad guy.}
<A>__{three fighters return from the i beem pursuit. empty handed.}
<C>__{fighter one}
<D>__{he got away.}
<A>__{flynn scowls at rush. sin number two. flynn slips tron's dead disk in a special case.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{let's move. x net goons will soon be all over this place.}
