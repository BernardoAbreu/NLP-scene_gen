<A>__{it's stopped raining, paul lies asleep. now, surprisingly, we hear a voice we've never heard in the movie before loud for an instant we don't recognize the voice, then we do: it's liberace talking to his audience on a record going, "thank you, thank you, what a wonderful thing it is for me to be back with you in paris..." paul stirs and awakens to discover that he is strapped to his bed. he can move his arms, but that's it.}
