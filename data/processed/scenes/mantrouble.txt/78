<L>__{interior andy's house living room some time later}
<A>__{joan, her garments soiled and disheveled from the pre vious scene, comes from the vicinity of the front door, closely followed by duke and harry:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{why didn't you have the damn dog with you, that's what he's for!}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i told you, he was in the house.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what the hell good is that! you have to have him with you at all times!}
<A>__{as they move into the living room, helen, wearing joan's chenille robe, her hair wildly askew, can be seen in the kitchen area, holding a bottle of liquor in one hand and searching through a cupboard for a glass.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i can't have him with me all the time, he's killing my mucous membranes...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{didn't i tell you, right from the start, it's very dangerous to fool around with people like red layls!}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no you didn't, i said he was dangerous, and you said he wasn't...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, but that's before he tried to part your hair with an axe!}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i don't know if it was him. maybe it was this tree surgeon...}
<A>__{she starts to move toward the bedroom and he stops her:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{wait a minute. how tall was he? about six one? kind of ugly?}
<A>__{helen, now with a drink in her hand, steps into view behind harry:}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he was about your height.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no, he wasn't, he was much taller.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{well let's not quibble, for god sakes. the man is a complete maniac...}
<P>__{(to harry)}
<D>__{and excuse me for saying, but this isn't a job for an amateur...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{but wait, he couldn't be the same man who burglarized my apartment, because that's before i came up here...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{forget about him. i know what i'm talking about...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{joan, if you don't call the police, i'm not staying here.}
<A>__{she takes the drink out of helen's hand and drains it while harry continues:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{guy like red layls have hit men working for them, that drive them around and do their dirty work for them.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{gee whiz, first it isn't red, now it is red. i can't keep up with these sudden reversals.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{alright... i'm calling a cab.}
<A>__{on helen, as she clumps away in the direction of the guest bedroom:}
