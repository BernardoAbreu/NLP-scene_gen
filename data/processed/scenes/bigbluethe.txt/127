<D>__{don't be afraid. it's my uncle... louis.}
<A>__{he goes to the tub and pinches the end of a tube. uncle louis, underwater, has been breathing through it. louis' head pops out of the water, furious.}
<C>__{uncle louis}
<D>__{assassin!}

<P>__{(pointing to jacques)}
<D>__{this idiot never listens to anything i say. sometimes i wonder if he isn't deaf.}
<A>__{louis climbs out of the bathtub, and pulls on a bathrobe. behind him he's pulling two insulated wires out of the bathtub. we see that they're connected to small underwater speakers. as they surface, incredibly loud music blasts: the finale of the "1812 overture", (trumpets, timpani, cannons, etc...) the sound fills the room, the apartment, and probably all of antibes.}
