<L>__{interior farmer house dining room night}
<A>__{ernest farmer sits alone, motionless, at the table. between two candles, facing him, is frances' check for a hundred dollars. we hear bustle from behind the kitchen door, then lillian and frances enter juggling several hot dishes. ernest rises. they set down the dishes, frances intentionally placing the bread between the check and her father.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{it always amazes me, lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{i can thank you for that. it was a hard earned talent.}
<A>__{she moves the bread so ernest again faces the check. as lillian slices the bread, father and daughter eat grimly.}
<C>__{lillian}
<P>__{(offering to ernest)}
<D>__{bread?}
<C>__{ernest}
<P>__{(taking a piece)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{when's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, ernest farmer?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{mama...}
<C>__{lillian}
<P>__{(pushing back her plate)}
<D>__{i'm not hungry. you two just enjoy yourselves. after all, this is a celebration.}
<A>__{she leaves. a long silence. they both glance slightly awkwardly at the check. frances takes it, folds it, and puts it in her pocket, out of sight.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{i'm... i'm really proud of you, frances.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{thanks, dad.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{an essay contest... a national contest. that's pretty impressive.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i didn't have much to do with it.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{you wrote it, didn't you?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{yeah, i suppose... dad, who's harry york?}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{well, harry york is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. why do you ask?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{he talked to me today. told me to keep my mouth shut or i'd get everybody in trouble.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{yeah... well... it's possible. harry york and i both work for mr. kaminski right now, and... well... there are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. that's the way of things, but mr. kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{is kaminski a communist?}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{no, no, no. all he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{he's a socialist, then?}
