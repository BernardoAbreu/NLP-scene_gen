<A>__{lighthouse sits on a point across the lake. the sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from a figure still shrouded by covers. claire sits beside the sleeping form. she scans the room briefly, taking in a greenpeace flag and a picture of a tomboyish ten year old girl at camp. she gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same face, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year old, with chopped hair and tiny nose ring. claire leans over and inhales the sleeping scent of her only daughter, caitlin. she places her hand on a cheek. the girl's eyelids flutter softly.}
