<L>__{interior bank lobby day}
<A>__{zoey looks at all the people sitting around her. they're all scared. jean, ricardo, and francois are talking amongst themselves.}
<C>__{jean}
<P>__{(in french to ricardo)}
<D>__{[do you know one?]}
<C>__{ricardo}
<D>__{[let's see. okay. an unfortunate fellow was locked up in prison doing five to ten for armed robbery. all he could think of the whole time was eating pussy.]}
<A>__{zoey looks up at them telling the joke.}
<C>__{ricardo}
<D>__{[the day finally came for his release. he walked out of the prison with a new suit and fifty francs the officials had given him, and made a bee line for the whorehouse in the nearest town. slamming his fifty francs on the front desk, he said, "i wanna eat some pussy."]}
<A>__{jean is already laughing.}
<C>__{ricardo}
<D>__{[i'm not done. listen. "where've you been," said the greasy fellow behind the desk, "fifty francs won't get you a close look these days."]}
<A>__{zoey glances at all of the people. then her eyes lock with the concierge security guard.}
<C>__{ricardo}
<D>__{["listen buddy," said the ex convict, pulling him out of his chair by the shirt collar, "i wanna eat some pussy, and i want it now!"]}
<A>__{the concierge security guard lifts his pant leg slowly.}
<C>__{ricardo}
<D>__{["okay, okay," gasped the proprietor, "i will see what i can do." so the ex con followed him through to the very back of the warehouse through some stained, tattered red curtains, and into a grimy little room where a bedraggled looking whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed. "she's yours for fifty francs," said the proprietor, and the fellow went at it.]}
<A>__{zoey notices that on the concierge security guard's leg is an ankle holster with a small .38 pistol on it. his fingers begin to unsnap the safety harness on it. her eyes widen.}
<C>__{ricardo}
<D>__{[after a little while, he came across a piece of egg. "that's funny," he thought to himself, "i don't think i had egg for breakfast." but he spat it out and kept eating away. next he found a piece of chipped beef wedged between his front teeth. "i'm sure i haven't eaten chipped beef this week," he thought, but kept on. then he came across the corn. "what is this?" he said, "i think i'm going to be sick."]}
<A>__{the concierge security guard unsnaps the safety. zoey knows he's going to make his move.}
<C>__{ricardo}
<D>__{["ya know," says the whore, "that's what the last guy said."]}
<A>__{before they can even laugh the concierge security guard whips out the .38 and fires three shots. two of them hit ricardo in the chest. he falls to the ground. the other hits francois in the arm. in an instant jean is firing his machine gun into the group of people huddled on the floor. everyone is screaming and trying to get away. machine gun fire cuts through the concierge security guard killing him dead. unfortunately, the wild spray of bullets also rips into three of the tellers, four of the customers, and the loan officer, killing them all. people are trying to flee but claude fires his gun into the ceiling.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{[no one fucking moves!]}
<A>__{jean has jumped up on the table and is aiming at the people.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{[shit! what happened!?]}
