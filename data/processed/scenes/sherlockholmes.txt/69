<A>__{holmes stands in the middle of the street contentedly observing humanity. watson enters frame and hands holmes a bundle wrapped in newspaper.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i fail to see how these fish and chips are different from the three other places we passed along the way.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{trust me.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{just eat.}
<A>__{holmes complies hungrily and they start to stroll along. watson appears preoccupied.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you know, i've seen things in war that i couldn't explain. i once heard a man predict his death, down to the number and placement of the bullet holes that killed him. you have to admit that a supernatural explanation is at least theoretically possible.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(mouth full, near indecipherable)}
<D>__{never theorize before you have data. invariably, you end up twisting facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. adler's midget is the key to this.}
<A>__{holmes pulls out a jeweler's loup, screws it into his eye, and flips reordon's watch open. he examines the lid.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{hmm... scratches around the keyhole, what does that tell you?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{the owner was most likely a drunk. each time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{very good, watson! you've developed considerable powers of your own.}
<A>__{watson looks quite chuffed.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored into the lid.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{pawnbroker's marks.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{excellent.}
<A>__{watson looks extremely pleased with himself until they turn a corner into a street where every second shop is a pawn shop. his face falls.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{the most recent is m.h...}
<A>__{watson shakes his head.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{maddison and haig.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{oh my lord, here we are. they should give us an address.}
<A>__{we see maddison & haig, pawnbrokers, respectable, discreet, ahead of them there on bow street.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{there's one thing you've missed. on the watch.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i think not.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{the time. which leads me to deduce that i'm already late for my appointment with mary. you remember, the one i was leaving for before you talked me into coming to dig up dead bodies with you.}
<A>__{a gypsy palm reader approaches watson as he turns to leave.}
<C>__{palm reader}
<D>__{reckon your future, sir?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{perhaps we do need a little help from the beyond.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<A>__{she grabs his hand anyway.}
<C>__{palm reader}
<D>__{you need to hear what i have to tell you.}
<A>__{watson is so taken aback by the urgency and gravity of her tone that he doesn't pull away.}
<C>__{palm reader}
<D>__{i see two men, brothers. not in blood but in bond. i see the letters s and an l, no... wait, a j.}
<A>__{holmes and watson look at each other. she has their attention.}
<C>__{palm reader}
<P>__{(wincing)}
<D>__{i see madness. a man driven out of his mind by a malign force.}
<A>__{watson looks at holmes.}
<C>__{palm reader}
<D>__{i see a letter... the letter m... another m... mary? you will be married... i see... i see...}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{patterned table clothes, china figurines, lace doilies...}
<A>__{watson snatches his hand away.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you think you are clever don't you?}
<A>__{holmes feigns innocence.}
<C>__{palm reader}
<D>__{she turns to fat...}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{enough.}
<A>__{the palm reader looks at holmes.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(to watson)}
<D>__{do you have any changes?}
<A>__{watson shakes his head as he pays the woman.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{this is a new low even for you.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it's the most honest prediction old flora has made in years. and you know it yourself, watson. that is precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring. you're terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre, as well you should be.}
<A>__{holmes swallows the last of his cod and casts the wrapping aside, pleased with himself.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{do you still have my cut from the fight?}
<A>__{holmes digs into a pocket, produces a wad of coins.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{why, do you }
<A>__{watson snatches the money, storms into madison and haig. holmes is confused until he spots a sign in the window: "large selection of engagement rings for every wallet." holmes starts to look a bit nervous. as he follows watson, he is intercepted by the palm reader who grabs his arm.}
<C>__{palm reader}
<D>__{i seen something in his hand. darkness and great pain. mortal peril. warn your friend, he's not safe.}
<A>__{even holmes is taken aback by this.}
