<T>__{time dissolve to:}
<L>__{int lambeau's office day}
<A>__{the office is more crowded than usual. tom and three of lambeau's colleagues including the esteemed alexander pekec are in the room. will sits at a work station which projects a proof of his [will's] onto the chalkboard. lambeau stands beside the projected image at the board arguing with pekec, a foreign mathematician. the image is of a ramses graph binary tree.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{alexander, i know your theory. the boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...}
<C>__{pekec}
<D>__{with a ramses graph on the binary tree }
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{ but what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. he can always failsafe to either side }
<C>__{pekec}
<D>__{maker can. this is not new, gerry!}
<A>__{pekec starts writing lines beside will's proof on the board.}
<C>__{pekec}
<D>__{but i can always garbage out}
<P>__{(writes frantically)}
<D>__{all the way to "n" to the minus one.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{no, there's a limit.}
<C>__{pekec}
<D>__{the limit is not found!}
<P>__{(turns to will)}
<D>__{the limit is not found.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{but i can always go to the other side.}
<C>__{pekec}
<D>__{there is no proof }
<A>__{lambeau can no longer contain himself.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{maker builds "k" to the "n." n is three to the k times }
<C>__{pekec}
<D>__{ but }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{look, i wrote it down.}
<A>__{they turn to will who places his proof on the projector. the image is cast over their faces. it reads: as pekec reads and the realization dawns on him:}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's just simpler this way.}
<A>__{lambeau turns with satisfaction to an understanding pekec.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{alexander, your theory is changed.}
