<L>__{interior james' room basement}
<A>__{electric candelabras light a large converted cellar whose walls are crowded with movie posters and lobby cards. there are stacks of what look suspiciously like library books and an enormous baroque bed, complete with canopy.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{i like what you've done with it. when's captain nemo moving in?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{the candelabras were my gran's.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{oh, christ, don't start on ol' gran or we'll leave you here.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{hey, i heard all about it the parents, the grandparents, the china town thing and i believe you, okay? that's why we're here. now go get dressed.}
<A>__{james scoops up the shirt grady lent him. this morning.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{can i i mean do you mind if i wear this again. professor tripp?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{ah, wear whatever you want.}
<A>__{james flinches, stung, then disappears into a bathroom.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{so modest.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{so sensitive.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<P>__{(nosing around the room)}
<D>__{oh, come on, tripp. cut the kid some slack.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{it's just ail that crap he spins out. just once i'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{the truth. i know that's always been real important to you. key, check this out...}
<A>__{crabtree leans over an old royal typewriter, reads from the freshly typed page curling from the carriage.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{finally, the door opened. it was a shock to: see him, shuffling into the room like an aging prizefighter. limping. beaten.'}
<P>__{(with an amused smile)}
<D>__{sound like anyone we know?}
<P>__{(resuming)}
<D>__{but it was later, when the great man squinted into the bitter glow or twilight...}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{bitter glow of twilight? this kid definitely needs an editor.}
<P>__{(resuming)}
<A>__{...and muttered simply, "it means nothing. all of it. nothing," that the true shock came. it was then that the boy understood that his hero's true injuries lay hidden in a darker place. his heart...' crabtree stops abruptly.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{yes? 'his heart...'}
<A>__{crabtree hesitates, then... reads on:}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{'his heart, once capable of inspiring others so completely, could no longer inspire so much as itself. it beat now only out of habit. it beat now only because it could. '}
<A>__{grady nods, his face unreadable, then james returns.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i'm ready...}
<A>__{james stops, sees the two men looking at him.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{you all right, professor tripp?}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{he's great. come on, let's blow before ol' gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{oh, well, that's just it. she's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. if i'm not here, she might ...call the police or.. .something.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{hhhuh. so we decoy her. stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.}
<C>__{james leer}
<P>__{(brightening)}
<D>__{yeah. like in against all flags. only they use a couple big hams.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{crabtree and james turn.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i've got something better than a teddy bear.}
