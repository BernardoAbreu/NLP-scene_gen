<A>__{as enid and seymour walk. a 20 ish secretary type passes.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what about her? would you go out with her?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i don't know, what kind of question is that? i mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{but putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i really didn't get a good look at her.}
