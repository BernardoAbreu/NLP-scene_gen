<A>__{the dashboard is littered with fast food detritus and two coffees in styrofoam cups making fog circles on the windshield. a hand picks up one of the coffees and we follow it to a face, a forty year old cop face that's seen some wear and tear behind the wheel is matt sykes. beside him is his partner of nine years, bill tuggle. tuggle expertly munches on a slice of pizza as he talks.}

<D>__{how can i go?}
<C>__{tuggle}
<D>__{put on your wash and wear suit and your clip on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church. simple.}

<D>__{me and carol are going.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tuggle}
<D>__{hey, look we've known kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in big bear. remember? you and edie banged the wall so hard, me and carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...}

<D>__{goddammit, tug i want to see kristin get married, okay? but }
<C>__{tuggle}
<D>__{but you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{shit, if kristin had to get married where i could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at buddy's burgers.}
<A>__{sykes stares out the window, wallowing in his pissed off mood. then he spots something that twinges his street cop radar.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{uh oh... check it out.}
<A>__{through the window tuggle sees what sykes sees: two aliens in long coats moving down the sidewalk, entering a mom and pop mini mart on the corner. one of them wears dark glasses and a red bandana (kipling): the other has on a black vinyl raincoat.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{does that look at all suspicious to you?}
<C>__{tuggle}
<D>__{whatever gave you that idea?}
