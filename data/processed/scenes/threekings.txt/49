<D>__{that's right, that's what they do.}
<A>__{troy, doc, vig watch with trepidation as archie walks toward the soldier slashing the man in glasses, who carries the girl. archie reaches over and grabs the slasher's wrist, pulling the blade away from the man's body. he holds the soldier's wrist up. the soldier grabs for archie's throat with his free hand, but archie grabs this hand and twists it away, putting the iraqi into a choke hold. the soldier drops the knife in the dirt. the bloodied man in glasses collapses to the ground, clutching the little girl in arm casts. troy, doc, vig point their guns. the iraqi major is pissed. archie sweeps the soldier's feet out, pins the soldier face down on the ground, and throws the soldier's gun away. archie helps the shiite man in glasses to his feet, takes the girl, and walks them over to the humvee. two shiite prisoners try to stand up, the iraqi guards kick them back down.}
