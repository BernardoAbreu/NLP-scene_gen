<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{an animation sequence, real quick. an explosion of many different colors, complete with a choir and a church organ}
<B>__{all building to a huge crescendo.}
<T>__{back to:}
<L>__{int bar}
<A>__{on tom:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i think it's...kind of a huge thing.}
<C>__{summer}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ok. looks like we're gonna have to agree to disagree on that one.}
<A>__{mckenzie senses some discontent.}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<D>__{so, uh, who's singing next?}
<C>__{summer}
<P>__{(re: singing)}
<D>__{i'd say it's your turn loverboy.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{nooo. i don't sing in public.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{sure you do. i see you lip synching to your headphones every morning on your way in.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i don't...}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<D>__{you really do.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{it's ok. i like it. takes a lot of self confidence to look ridiculous.}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<P>__{(can't help himself)}
<D>__{self confidence! ha!}
<A>__{tom elbows him in the ribs again.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{anyway, i'm not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these people.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{ok then. let's drink.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it would take at least ten shots to get me to sing.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{bartender!}
<A>__{ten minutes later. tom is up there singing the clash's "magnificent seven." you wouldn't think so but tom is a rock star up there! he's dancing like jagger, he's got everyone in the bar singing along to the audience participation parts. it's a sight to behold. summer is all smiles watching. later. tom and summer back at the table. summer is humming something.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{that's not it.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{what is that then?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<A>__{they're both having a good time.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i used to watch it every week.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{me too. why can't we think of the stupid a team theme song.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{pathetic.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this is gonna bother me for weeks.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{totally.}
<A>__{they share another laugh and then it gets quiet. in that good way. angle on mckenzie, wasted, singing the shit out of "proud to be an american." he really means it. at any minute he might start to cry.}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<D>__{"and i'd proudly stand up!"}
<P>__{(aggressive drunk)}
<D>__{i said stand!}
<A>__{back on tom and summer.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{oh here we go.}
