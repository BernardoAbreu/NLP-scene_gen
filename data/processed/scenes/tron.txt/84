<L>__{interior cave}
<A>__{ram, tron and flynn are climbing up to an opening in the wall of the cave. beyond them we can see a cluster of structures, like a cityscape, and one enormous tower with a golden beam of light rising from it, farther up than the eye can see. no tanks are visible.}

<P>__{(looking out)}
<D>__{it's all circuits...}
<P>__{(points at tower)}
<D>__{must be an input output component...}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{the tower, yes flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself like what sector you're from?}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(sitting down against a rock)}
<D>__{well...my home "sector" was called paramus ...}
<C>__{ram}
<P>__{(sits also)}
<D>__{paramus... wonder what those initials stand for ... (starts counting them off on his fingers) ...probably program assist routine well, it sounds like a lovely place.}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{it grows on you.}
<A>__{he notices that tron is not listening to them any longer, but is gazing upwards.}
<C>__{tron}
<P>__{(murmuring)}
<D>__{i can feel it ...}
<A>__{flynn and ram turn.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{feel what? you okay?}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{alan one...}
<C>__{tron}
<D>__{yes... he's got something to tell me...}
<A>__{ram and tron look out at the distant tall tower.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{you think we can make it there?}
<C>__{tron}
<D>__{we have to.}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(pointing to a corner of the cave)}
<D>__{hey, what's that?}
<A>__{they all look back, into the darkness behind them. a glowing stream can just be seen. ram gets up.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{it's just what we need.}
