<D>__{i want you to let 'em be judged! i want you to stand up and make an argument!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{an argument that didn't work for calley at my lai, an argument that didn't work for the nazis at nuremberg.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{for christ sake, sam, do you really think that's the same as two teenage marines executing a routine order that they never believed would result in harm? these guys aren't the nazis.}

<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{you and dawson both live in the same dreamland. it doesn't matter what i believe, it only matters what i can prove. so please don't tell me what i know and don't know. i know the law.}
<A>__{jo looks at him, shakes her head, and turns to walk away. she turns back.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{you know nothing about the law. you're a used car salesman, daniel. you're an ambulance chaser with a rank. you're nothing.}
