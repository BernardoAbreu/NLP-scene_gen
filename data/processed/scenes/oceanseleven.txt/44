<L>__{exterior union station evening}
<A>__{linus exits, casually reaching into his jacket to count his winnings. and his face falls. all he finds where the stolen wallet once resided is a calling card. on one side, in engraved printing: "daniel ocean." on the flip side, in handwriting: "nice pull. murphy's bar, rush & division."}
<L>__{interior murphy's bar five minutes later}
<A>__{on a tabletop: the gucci wallet beside a half drunk guinness. linus enters the front door, cases the joint, spots the wallet on the table, and danny behind it.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{hi, linus. sit down.}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{a friend of bobby caldwell's. sit down.}
<A>__{linus balks, prideful, but sense finds a way, and he sits.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{bobby told me about you. said you were the best set of hands he ever saw. didn't expect to find you working wallets on the subway.}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{that wasn't work, that was practice.}
<A>__{danny reaches into his jacket and sets a plane ticket on the table. he keeps his hand over it.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you're either in or out, right now.}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{a plane ticket. a job offer.}

<D>__{you're pretty trusting pretty fast.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{bobby has every faith in you.}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{fathers are like that.}
<P>__{(off danny's reaction)}
<D>__{he didn't tell you?}
<P>__{(as danny shakes his head)}
<D>__{he doesn't like me trading on his name.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you do this job, he'll be trading on yours.}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{what if i say no?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{we'll get someone else who won't be quite as good. you can go back to feeling up stockbrokers.}
<A>__{linus considers. he looks down at the ticket, then at the wallet. it's one or the other. a waitress passes, and danny signals her for his bill. when his attention returns to linus, the wallet remains... but the ticket beneath his hand is gone. linus is reading it.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{that's the best lift i've seen you make yet.}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{las vegas, huh?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{america's playground.}
