<L>__{interior bruwer house living room late evening}
<A>__{a very tense ben is sitting on professor bruwer's chair. melanie is curled up on the old settee.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{they don't know what you've got and you're a danger to them. i know there's a point of no return, but with our system, one has to plot the route with care.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that's the main reason for coming here tonight. melanie, i need your help. without emily, we can't pursue our civil suit. the only thing left open to us is to expose them through the press, and the media here and abroad.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{and your safety also, ben, lies in the press.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that way the world will know the brutality and power of our security services; here questions can be asked in parliament. and the white public can appreciate the implications of the fascist laws of this country.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you know, melanie, i'm discovering that the enemy is not in soweto. the enemy is ourselves. our bigotry, our laws, our system. we have our own fight and it's just beginning.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{we better win before the blacks have won.}
<A>__{ben and melanie laugh.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{now, before going to the press, i have to have all the documents. i must have two vital affidavits; dr. hassiem's, he's detained and jonathan's friend, wellington has fled to zambia.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{zambia? i'm going to rhodesia... i can go to zambia.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{could you?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{and i can use my british passport. i know my way around lusaka.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that would be very useful.}
<A>__{melanie jumps off the settee.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{this calls for a drink. gin and tonic?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{as melanie walks away, ben looks at her with admiration and tenderness... her dress swinging around her legs... her bare feet soundless on the floor... the quiet grace of her movement. on the way to the kitchen to get the drinks, melanie goes to the record player. there's a record already on the turntable. suddenly as if rising from a dream, ben murmurs:}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{melanie. be careful.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(as she plays the}
<D>__{record and}
<P>__{flippantly)}
<D>__{of course, ben.}
<A>__{she goes into the kitchen. as melanie hums to herself to the blues music, in the kitchen, ben walks over to the window and furtively glances out, to assure himself that nobody is watching. he takes then a book on a pile next to the settee and pages slowly through it. melanie returns with two glasses, still in her happy mood. she places ben's glass on the side table next to the settee, takes the book from him and makes him sit down.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{cheers!}
<A>__{ben raises his glass and touches it with hers.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{do be careful. i wouldn't want you hurt.}
<A>__{she reaches for his hand.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(with gentleness)}
<D>__{don't worry.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{and hurry back.}
<A>__{a new track starts on the record.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{that's my favorite, ben.}
<A>__{jumping up and taking ben's glass and placing it on the side table, she pulls him to his feet.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i can't dance.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{rugger player?}
<A>__{they laugh as they start to dance to the slow blues music. the laughing subsides as they hold each other closer. the dancing starts to lose the beat of the music. they look into each other's eyes and ben envel ops her tenderly in his arms hugging her as close as possible against him. they stop dancing. ben kisses her. a long, warm and tender kiss.}
