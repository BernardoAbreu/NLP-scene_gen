<A>__{an agitated mary swanson (the young woman who lost her briefcase) is pacing back and forth in an impressive, antique filled living room. seated on a couch are her father karl and his much younger second wife, helen.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it just doesn't make any sense. i left the money exactly where they instructed me to.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{actually, it makes a great deal of sense, mary. we should have called in the authorities the moment we knew melvin had been kidnapped.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{now, helen, we've been through this already for christ's sake, karl, these bastards will extort us into bankruptcy if we let them.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{but i'd never forgive myself if something happened to melvin.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{stop upsetting my daughter, helen. she's been through quite enough already.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it's not her fault, daddy. we're all a little on edge.}
<A>__{just then the living room door opens and the pony tailed nicholas andre enters. he looks appropriately solemn.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{has there been any word, mr. swanson?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{nothing yet, nicholas.}
<A>__{andre looks upset.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{perhaps i should call off the preservation benefit this weekend.}
<A>__{it would be easy enough to re schedule.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no, nicholas, it's imperative that we carry on as usual.}
<A>__{the atmosphere in the room couldn't be more somber. karl swanson holds his hand out to his aughter.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{don't worry, sweetheart. i will do everything they ask. nothing's going to happen to melvin, i promise you.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{thank you, daddy.}
<A>__{karl swanson looks out the window, concerned.}
