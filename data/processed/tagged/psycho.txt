<L>__{exterior phoenix, arizona (day) helicopter shot}
<A>__{above midtown section of the city. it is early afternoon, a hot mid summer day. the city is sun sunblanched white and its drifted up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes. we fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over traffic clogged streets, parking lots, white business buildings, neatly patterned residential districts. as we approach downtown section, the character of the city begins to change. it is darker and shabby with age and industry. we see railroad tracks, smokestacks, wholesale fruit and vegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty lots. vegetable the very geography seems to give us a climate of nefariousness, of back doorness, dark and shadowy. and secret. we fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific location. a skinny, high old hotel comes into view. on its exposed brick side great painted letters advertise "transients low weekly rates radio in every room." we pause long enough to establish the shoddy character of this hotel. its open, curtainless windows, its silent resigned look so characteristic of such hole and corner hotels. we move forward with purposefulness and toward a certain window. the sash is raised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled down to three or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants of the room within wanted privacy but needed air. we are close now, so that only the lower half of the window frame is in shot. no sounds come from within the room. suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between shade and sill, peep into the room. a young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. she wears a full slip, stockings, no shoes. she lies in and attitude of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of the room, betrays a certain inner tension, worrisome conflicts. she is mary crane, an tension, attractive girl nearing the end of her twenties and her rope. a man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure visible. we hold on this tableau for a long moment, then start forward. as we pass under the window shade,}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior the hotel room (day)}
<A>__{a small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow bed. a card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the bureau. an unopened suitcase and a woman's large, straw open top handbag are on the bureau. on the table beside the bed there are a container of coco cola and an unwrapped, untouched egg salad sandwich. there is no radio. the man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, t shirt and sox, is sam loomis, a good looking, sensual shirt man with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile. he is blotting his neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at mary, a small sweet smile playing about his mouth. mary keeps her face turned away from him. after a moment, sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans over and takes mary into his arms, kisses her long and warmly, holds her with a firm possessiveness. the kiss is disturbed and finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an inconsiderate fly. sam smiles, pulls away enough to allow mary to relax again against the pillow. he studies her, frowns at her unresponsiveness, then speaks in a low, intimate, playful voice.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{never did eat your lunch, did you.}
<A>__{mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, kisses him. then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings her legs over the side of the bed, toe searches around, finds her shoes, slips her feet into searches them. and finally pulls away and sits up.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i better get back to the office. these extended lunch hours give my boss excess acid.}
<A>__{she rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. sam watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery, humorous good mood. throughout remainder of this scene, they occupy themselves with dressing, hair combing, etc.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. it's friday anyway... and hot.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(soft sarcasm)}
<D>__{what do i do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(meaningfully)}
<D>__{we could laze around here a while longer.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{checking out time is three p.m. hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...}
<P>__{(a small anguish)}
<D>__{sam, i hate having to be with you in a place like this.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. they say it...}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{when you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you sure talk like a girl who's been married.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{sam!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mary.}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{my old dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i've lost my girlish laughter.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(observing)}
<D>__{the only girlish thing you have lost.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(a meaningful quiet, then, with difficulty:)}
<D>__{sam. this is the last time.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{this! meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! you come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... i wish you wouldn't even come.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{okay. what do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(about to argue, then turning away)}
<D>__{i haven't time to argue. i'm a working girl.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and i'm a working man! we're a regular working class tragedy!}
<P>__{(he laughs)}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it is tragic! or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(interrupting, seriously)}
<D>__{you can't laugh at it, huh?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{can you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sure. it's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...}
<A>__{he breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window, tries to raise the shade. it sticks. he pulls at it. it comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room, revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if corroborating mary's words and attitude. sam kicks at the fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor again.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and besides, when you say i make tax deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(having to smile)}
<D>__{you couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i wish i were. not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.}
<P>__{(goes close to mary, touches her)}
<D>__{next best thing to no conscience at all.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(pulling away)}
<D>__{i have to go, sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i can come down next week.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and after the steak... do we send sister to the movies and turn mama's picture to the wall?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{sam! no!}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(after a pause, simply)}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{she stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them even after the sexual bait has been pulled in. sam smiles reassuringly, places his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and simple sincerity.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{mary, whenever it's possible, tax deductible or not, i want to see deductible you. and under any conditions.}
<P>__{(a smile)}
<D>__{even respectability.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you make respectability sound... disrespectful.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{i'm all for it! it requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{but if i can see you, touch you even as simply as this... i won't mind.}
<A>__{he moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems crushes away his good humor. there is a quiet moment.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. i sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... i sweat to pay my ex wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(a smile)}
<D>__{i pay, too. they also pay who meet in hotel rooms.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{a couple of years and the debts will be paid off. and if she ever re marries, the alimony stops... and then...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i haven't even been married once yet!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(smiling, then with a terrible urgency)}
<D>__{sam, let's go get married.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in fairvale. we'll have a lot of laughs. when i send my ex wife her money, you can lick the stamps.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(a deep desperation)}
<D>__{i will lick the stamps.}
<A>__{he looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, looks out the window and stares at the wide sky.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you know what i'd like? a clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on. and the wherewithal to buy what i'd like.}
<P>__{(he moves away, suddenly serious)}
<D>__{mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm thinking of it.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(a cheerful shout)}
<D>__{how can you even think a thing like that!}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(picking up handbag, starting for door)}
<D>__{don't miss your plane.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hey, we can leave together can't we?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(at door)}
<D>__{i'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.}
<A>__{mary goes out quickly, closing door behind her. as sam stares down at his shoeless feet,}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior downtown street (day) high angle}
<A>__{shooting down at hotel entrance. mary comes out, walks quickly to a parked cab, gets in. the cab zooms up the awful street.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}

<A>__{a small, moderately successful office off the main street. a cab pulls up at the curb. we see mary get out of cab, pay driver, cross pavement to the office door.}

<A>__{mary enters office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her temples, finally looks over at caroline, a girl in the last of her teens.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{isn't mr. lowery back from lunch?}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(a high, bright, eager }
<D>__{to talk voice laced to with a vague texan}
<P>__{accent)}
<D>__{he's lunching with the man who's buying the harris street property, you know, that oil lease man... so that's why he's late.}
<P>__{(a pause, then, as}
<D>__{mary does not respond}
<P>__{to the pointed thrust)}
<D>__{you getting a headache?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it'll pass. headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you got aspirins? i have something... not aspirins, but}
<P>__{(cheerfully takes}
<D>__{bottle of pills out}
<P>__{of desk drawer)}
<D>__{my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{teddy was furious when he found out i'd taken tranquilizers!}
<A>__{she rises, starts for mary's desk, pills in hand.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{were there any calls?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{teddy called. me... and my mother called to see if teddy called. oh, and your sister called to say she's going to tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...}
<A>__{she breaks off, distracted by the sound of the door opening. mr. lowery and his oil lease client, tom cassidy enter the office. lowery is a pleasant, worried faced man, big and a trifle pompous. cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch hour load on. he is a gross man, exuding a kind of pitiful vulgarity.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{wow! hot as fresh milk! you girls should get your boss to air condition you up. he can afford it today.}
<A>__{lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at mary, tries to lead cassidy toward the private office.}
<C>__{lowery}
<D>__{mary, will you get those copies of the deed ready for mr. cassidy.}
<A>__{cassidy pauses beside mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the desktop, smiles a wet smile at mary.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{tomorrow's the day! my sweet little girl...}
<P>__{(laughs as mary looks up at him)}
<D>__{not you, my daughter! a baby, and tomorrow she stands up there and gets her sweet self married away from me!}
<P>__{(pulling out wallet)}
<D>__{i want you to look at my baby. eighteen years old... and she's never had an unhappy day in any one of those years!}
<P>__{(flashes photo)}
<A>__{mary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make some remark, continues sorting out the deed copies, tries to ignore the man's hot breath closeness.}

<C>__{cassidy}
<P>__{(ignoring lowery)}
<D>__{you know what i do with unhappiness? i buy it off! you unhappy?}

<D>__{not inordinately.}
<P>__{(puts deed copy into}

<P>__{hand)}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{i'm buying this house for my baby's wedding present. forty thousand dollars, cash! now that ain't buying happiness, that's buying off unhappiness! that penniless punk she's marryin'...}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{probably a good kid... it's just that i hate him.}
<P>__{(looks at deed)}
<D>__{yup! forty thousand, says here...}
<P>__{(to lowery)}
<D>__{casharoonie!}
<A>__{he takes out of his inside pocket, two separate bundles of new $100 bills and throws them onto the desk, under mary's nose. caroline's eyes go wide at the sight of the glorious green bundles of bills, and she comes close to the desk. cassidy leans terribly close to mary, flicks through the bills, laughs wickedly.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{i never carry more than i can afford to lose!}
<P>__{(closer to mary)}

<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{speakin' of feeling good, where's that bottle you said you had in your desk...}
<P>__{(laughs, as if having}

<D>__{oops!}
<P>__{(to mary, patting her arm)}
<D>__{usually i can keep my mouth shut!}

<D>__{i don't even want it in the office over the weekend. put it in the safe deposit box, at the bank, mary. and we'll get him to give us a check on monday instead.}
<A>__{he starts quickly away when it looks like cassidy is going to come and pull him bodily into the office. when the men are gone and the door is closed, caroline picks up a bundle, smiles at it.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{he was flirting with you. i guess he noticed my wedding ring.}
<A>__{mary has put one bundle into a large envelope and takes the other from caroline. when the bills are away, she puts the filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office door, knocks, starts to open door as:}

<A>__{a double bed in the foreground. we just see the far side as the camera shoots across. mary enters the scene, clad only in her slip. perhaps she is about to get into bed. behind her is an open closet, but too dark inside for us to see any contents. as mary turns to the closet the camera lowers to show a close view of the $40,000 in the envelope on our side of the bed. mary takes a dress from the closet and starts to put it on as the camera retreats to reveal a packed but not yet closed suitcase also on the bed. mary zips up her dress and then brings some final garments from the closet. she comes around to the suitcase and puts them on the top. mary works with haste and in tension, as if acting on an impulse which might vanish as quickly as it came. the suitcase filled now, she checks around the room, then takes her handbag to the bed, puts in the money filled envelope, and then slams the suitcase shut. then filled she looks at her small bedroom desk, goes to it, removes a small file envelope from one of the drawers. it is one of those brown envelopes in which one keeps important papers and policies and certificates. she checks its contents briefly, puts it on the bed, opens another desk drawer, takes out her bank book, tosses it on the bed. then she packs both the file envelope and the bank book, into her handbag, takes one quick last look around the room, picks up the handbag and the suitcase and goes out of the room.}

<A>__{a two car garage. one car is gone. mary's car is parked in the driveway. the camera is low enough so that we can easily read the arizona number plate in the foreground. mary comes out of house, starts for the trunk, intending to put the suitcase in, changes her mind, places the suitcase and her handbag on the front seat, gets in, starts the car, begins to back out of driveway.}

<A>__{we are close on mary's car, shooting in at her troubled, guilty face. she seems to be driving with that excess care of one who does not wish to be stopped for a minor traffic irregularity. she stops for a red light at a main intersection. from mary's viewpoint (day) we see lowery and cassidy crossing the street, passing right in front of mary's car. mary's car (day) mary freezes.}

<A>__{now we look closely at lowery. as he reaches the curb, a small confusion brightens his face. he remembers that mary intended to "spend the weekend in bed." he considers, curiously, turns, looks back at her, a slight frown on his face. mary's car (day) mary sees the pause and the look.}

<A>__{sam is seated at his desk, writing a letter. sequence begins with camera in close, over sam's shoulder, and we can read as mush as he has written of the letter. the letterhead reads "sam loomis hardware," and the letter reads: "dearest right as always mary: i'm sitting in this tiny back room which isn't big enough for both of us, and suddenly it looks big enough for both of us. so what if we're poor and cramped and miserable, at least we'll be happy! if you haven't come to your senses, and still want to... camera begins pulling away as sam turns the sheet of paper over, continues backing away out of the small back room and heads, backwards, down the corridor, we see a young clerk, bob summerfield, sam's assistant, standing behind the counter, a look of handsome patience on his face. he is waiting on a meticulous, elderly woman customer, who is holding and examining a large can of insecticide. as camera passes:}
<C>__{woman customer}
<D>__{...they tell you what its ingredients are and how it's guaranteed to exterminate any insect in the world, but they do not tell you whether or not it's painless. and i say insect or man, death should always be painless.}
<A>__{camera, by this has reached the front door of the hardware store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door. she is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner, a look of purposefulness. she carries a handbag and a small overnight case. she is mary's sister, lila crane. bob summerfield has noticed lila, smiles brightly at her, gives her an i will be with you in a moment nod. lila starts to walk toward the counter, never taking her eyes off bob. as she approaches, she asks quietly:}

<D>__{sam loomis.}

<D>__{sam! lady wants to see you!}
<A>__{lila looks to the back room. the woman customer goes on worriedly examining the fine print of the insecticide can. sam comes to the door of his room, pauses, looks at lila a moment, starts toward her, his expression indicating that he does not know her. lila studies him with a quiet, worried expression.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{may i talk to you?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(a bit mystified)}
<D>__{sure...}
<A>__{lila glances at the customer and the clerk, turns, starts toward the front of the store. sam holds a moment, then follows. as he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him intently as she says:}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i'm mary's sister.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{lila.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{is mary here?}
<A>__{sam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile expression on lila's face. he studies her for a quiet moment. behind them is a display of various size carving knives.}

<D>__{i want to know if my sister is here.}

<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{don't you know?}
<A>__{as sam is about to speak, the woman customer comes sailing past, speaking as she goes and wearing a satisfied smile.}
<C>__{woman customer}
<D>__{all i can do is hope if it isn't painless, it's quick!}
<A>__{she speaks "quick" with a kind of delicious bite, nods happily, goes on out of the store. sam is now staring apprehensively at lila.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what should i know?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{to begin with, where mary is. do you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no. i take it you don't either?}
<P>__{(as lila shakes her head)}
<D>__{how long?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{last friday. she left work, and home... i was in tucson over the weekend... i haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and you thought she'd come up here, to me? if she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{a good reason, i suppose.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(slightly exasperated)}
<D>__{well what do you think, we eloped or something? or we're living in sin and...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{mr. loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. mary is missing.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i was getting to that!}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{what do you know about it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{nothing! you're putting me on the defensive.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{look, if you two are in this thing together, i don't care, it's none of my business... but i want to see mary. i want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. then i will go back to phoenix and...}
<A>__{she stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes beginning to fill with worried tears. sam studies her for a moment, then turns and calls:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{bob? run out and get yourself some lunch.}
<C>__{summerfield}
<D>__{it's okay, sam, i brought it with me.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{run out and eat it.}

<D>__{you men and your egos.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{never mind my ego. let's talk about mary.}
<A>__{their attention is distracted by a man who has strolled quietly into the room. he ignores them, walks past them, goes behind the counter, takes down a sign reading "closed for lunch," walks back to the door, closes door, hangs the sign across the door window, locks the door, turns to sam and lila, folds his arms, smiles a particularly unfriendly smile.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{let's all talk about mary.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{who are you, friend?}

<D>__{wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's your interest?}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{money.}
<A>__{there is a moment's silence and then, unable to tolerate the sudden frightening happenings, sam explodes.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! i can take so much and then...}
<C>__{arbogast}
<P>__{(interrupting calmly)}
<D>__{your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.}
<A>__{sam looks at arbogast in utter shock and in that state asks one of those seemingly ridiculous questions.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{arbogast}
<P>__{(an almost amused smile)}
<D>__{must've needed it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<P>__{(to lila)}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{she was supposed to bank it, on friday, for her boss. she didn't.}

<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{she is your girl friend, isn't she?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. it was all in cash...}

<C>__{lila}
<D>__{sam, if she's here...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{she isn't!}
<A>__{a real look of anguish comes into lila's face. and arbogast studies it, then speaks.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{you came up here on a hunch, miss crane? nothing more? no phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{not even a hunch. just hope.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{with a little checking, i could get to believe you.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(anxiously)}
<D>__{i don't care if you do or... i want to see mary... before she gets in any deeper...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{did you check in phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold up...}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{she was seen leaving town in her car. seen by her very victims, i might add.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{i don't believe it.}
<P>__{(to lila, slowly)}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(a thoughtful pause)}
<D>__{yes... i just... did. the moment they told me...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you might have doubted for say five minutes or so, sister.}
<A>__{lila turns from sam, a flush of guilt and regret in her face. arbogast looks at her, quiet sympathetically.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{we're always quickest to doubt people who have a record for being honest. i think she's here, miss crane. where there's a boyfriend...}
<P>__{(trails off, smiles encouragingly)}
<D>__{she won't be back there among the nuts and bolts... but she'll be in this town... somewhere. i will find her.}
<A>__{he nods, takes down the closed for lunch sign, sails it to the counter, opens door, goes out into the street. after a quiet moment:}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'she stole the money.' 'we don't want to get her in trouble.' 'no don't bring the police in'...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{no. the man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and i... i should've called the police.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... all that cash...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i ought to call the police right now!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{why not? sam, is she hiding here? are you two planning to go away with the money?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{how could i go away? i'm in debt up to my...}
<P>__{(smiles at the}
<D>__{incongruity of his reply, then goes}
<P>__{serious)}
<D>__{if she did steal that money... it's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{she haven't even called you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i didn't see her... and i didn't hear from her! believe that!}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i need to... i need to believe something. this is the first time i've ever come up against anything i couldn't... understand.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you've led a charmed life.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{no. i just think... anything can be explained. but mary, doing a thing like this... i don't know how to handle...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{maybe we can handle it together.}
<P>__{(he smiles encouragingly)}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(a rueful shrug)}
<D>__{i came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all i know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. i'd better go home.}
<C>__{sam}
