<L>__{interior infirmary}
<A>__{norris' body is plopped on the examination table. copper stumbles and is steadied by some of the men. macready continues to keep his distance. copper places an oxygen mask over norris' face. he then rips open his shirt.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{so you sweethearts had yourselves a little trial. i just may have to kill you on general principle, nauls.}
<A>__{copper begins swathing norris' chest with a gelatin substance.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{...ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{we ain't buying that.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{damn it, quit the bickering and give me a hand. wheel that fibrillator over here.}
<A>__{sanchez pushes over the portable fibrillator. copper climbs up on the table and straddles norris' chest. unnoticed, clark paws the contents of the instrument tray behind his back.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{palmer, turn on that oxygen and hold the mask over his face... childs, grab his shoulders.}
<A>__{they do so. copper holds electrical prongs over norris' chest.}
<C>__{childs}
<P>__{(to macready, threatening)}
<D>__{you're going to have to sleep sometime.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{quiet down...}
<P>__{(to sanchez)}
<D>__{...turn that thing on.}
<A>__{sanchez depresses the "on" button.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{now hold him.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{i'm a real light sleeper, childs...}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{enough, macready!}
<A>__{dr. copper presses the prongs onto norris' chest and shoots a bolt of current. norris' body heaves upward. a slight crackling sound and an odd chirp through the oxygen mask.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{again... more current this time, sanchez...}
<A>__{buzzz. several more jolts from the prongs. clark's hand has found a scalpel. he gently lifts it out, bringing it to his side.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{and if anyone tries to wake me...}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{damn you, macready!}
<A>__{norris' body begins bounding up. more crackling and popping. his chest begins to break up and spread. the mask pops off a hideous mewing escaping from norris' distorted mouth. the men jump back, incredulous. dr. copper scrambles off his chest and flops to the floor.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{god... what...?}
<A>__{they watch on in stunned horror as the thing that was norris begins to change, to spread awkwardly on the slab. its clothes tearing. a shoe splits in half and falls to the floor, exposing the beginnings of a talon. macready charges toward it, shooing the men off.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{get out of the way!!}
<A>__{he unloads with a stream of flame. the body writhes in pain, belching and hissing. the slab catches fire. it struggles, lunges for the floor, straightens up, and moves a few feet. a black and yellow substance rips through its trousers and squirts to the floor. norris' body collapses on the fibrillating machine in flames. extinguishers are ripped from the walls and put to work. macready watches the smoking particles of ooze in fascination, as they twitch and mew on the floor. within seconds the fire is out. the men stand around in awe as they look upon the thing that was once norris. macready continues to observe the small particles. their tiny squeals abating into silence.}
