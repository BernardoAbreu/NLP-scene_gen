<A>__{wesker, jill and the others spit lead at the advancing creatures. bullets thunk into their bodies. blood flows, but the creatures seem to feel no pain. even when they're hit squarely in their skulls.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{head shots. ain't doin' nothin'!}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{that was the idea.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{what idea?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{to win. the idea was... to win.}
<A>__{jill aims at one of the hunters, pressing the trigger of her m 16, and not letting go until her clip runs out. the creature's head is turned ragged by the barrage... revealing an iron superstructure beneath the skin.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{now that... is a metal head.}
<A>__{jill looks up. chris jumps out of the open grate in the ceiling. rebecca jumps down after him.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{what d'ya think? should i wait for orders, or just wing it?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{wing it!}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you know...that just might be the ticket. wing the fuckers.}
<A>__{chris takes a careful shot with his winchester. he hits one of the hunters squarely on its wrist...which snaps. the creature drops to the floor.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{forget the head shots. they're useless. shoot for the joints. the joints!}
<A>__{rebecca opens fire with aiken's m 16, giving the others time to reload. barry is the first to resume firing...at the closest of the hunters... at its wrists, which are snapped by the bullets. the creature drops to the floor. the troopers fire at knees, ankles, elbows, which seem to be the weakest spots. more of the hunters drop from the ceiling...but they continue to advance, crawling, pushing themselves forward with whatever limbs remain intact.}
<C>__{speyer}
<D>__{run! we slowed 'em down. run!}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{where? as far as we'll get, either way, is a cement wall.}
<A>__{there are two hunters left on the ceiling. one of them makes a mighty, impossible lunge... and hits speyer like a battering ram, slashing his chest open with its claws. two of the hunters on the floor rush forward, not attacking, but wanting to feed on speyer's remains. brad, trembling, completely crazed, drops his weapon and backs away. he sees...one of those jigsaw tiles, a red one, glow from within. he thinks he's hallucinating until... ...the floor jerks, in a tight spasm. its steel facets begin to separate, sliding away from each other. the troopers narrowly escape as.. . ...the floor behind them grinds, in and out, left and right, as if it were chewing. speyer's body, and those of the hunters on the floor, are eaten by the powerful steel blades. but one hunter remains above it all. tchung tchung tchung, it continues to advance along the ceiling. an invisible, jigsawed door glides open twenty yards down the hall. the troopers run for it, and are met by a beautiful asian scientist... the woman we saw on the video playback... ada wong.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{you lost a man. if i had only been faster. i was unfamiliar with the mechanism.}
<A>__{tchung tchung... the hunter approaches .}
