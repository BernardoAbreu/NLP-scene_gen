<A>__{jack dodges the falling rope, moving back, past nagel and his men who are cutting out damaged sections of the gunwale with saws and adzes, prizing up decking and wrestling with the wrecked steering mechanism.}
<L>__{91. the stern day}
<A>__{jack looks down to where pullings and others have lifted the broken rudder from its hinges.}
<L>__{92. wide shot day}
<A>__{the ship swarming with men, cutting, splicing, hammering and hauling. every able bodied soul hard at work.}
<L>__{93. quarterdeck day}
<A>__{an optimistic breeze has picked up, fluttering the tattered ensign. the deck is now sloping at a forty five degree angle. killick hands a sandwich to pullings who passes it down to jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{damn this wind, mr. pullings! the acheron will be making a hundred and fifty miles a day in this.}
<C>__{pullings}
<D>__{aye, but hugging the coast, and stopping to board the odd merchantman}
<A>__{jack smiles at this and bites into his sandwich. to the uphill side, carpenters are erecting a scaffolding over the side of the ship.}
