<D>__{you still care for me, i know it.}
<A>__{liz resists. cris grips randy's arm.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{easy, man.}
<A>__{randy hauls off to slug cris. cris easily ducks the blow and answers with a solid punch to the belly. randy recovers and realizes he's up against a skilled opponent. he takes a stance, ready to get serious. he sticks a few jabs at cris, who easily slips from each one, like he saw them coming a mile away. randy goes for a hook. cris feints and lands an uppercut to randy's chin. most men would go down, but randy is so big, he stays up to take more punishment. cris delivers an elegant beating that humiliates the big guy and makes him look like an oaf. cris puts an end to it by breaking randy's nose. the big guy falls to his knees, bleeding. liz rushes to randy's side, holding her ex and glowering up at cris like he's a sadistic brute.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{get out of here! get out!}
<A>__{cris realizes he's blown it.}
