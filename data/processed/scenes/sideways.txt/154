<L>__{interior hospital er waiting room day}
<A>__{close on a cosmopolitan open to an article titled "24 ways to please your man." wider miles reads, while nearby a young boy dry heaves into a garbage can held by his father. an old woman parked in a wheelchair faces the wall. later miles is at a payphone. as he speaks he tries to peel off the metal long distance sticker.}
<C>__{maya }
<D>__{hi. it's maya. please leave a message.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{it's miles. listen, i don't know if you even care, but i had to call and tell you again how much i enjoyed our time together and how sorry i am things turned out the way they did. i think you're great, maya always have. from the first time you waited on me.}
<P>__{(bracing himself)}
<D>__{and while i'm at it, i guess you should know that my book is not getting published. i thought this one had a chance, but i was wrong. again. don't bother reading it you've got better things to do. so you see i'm not much of a writer. i'm not anything really. the only real talent i seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. we're leaving in the morning, and i want you to know that i take with me wonderful memories of you. i'm sorry. i'm really sorry.}
<A>__{what else to say? he hangs up. he returns to his seat. a moment later he extends his legs to look at his new shoes now stained with wine. later jack emerges unsteadily from the bowels of the emergency room, his face purple and swollen beneath the huge white bandage that holds the noseguard in place. miles walks with him toward the exit.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm going to need an operation. maybe a couple of them. they have to wait for it it to heal first. then they break it again.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{good thing you have a voice over career.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{gonna fuck that up too. i should sue her ass. only reason i won't is to protect christine.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{that's thoughtful.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{they walk by us and out the door.}
