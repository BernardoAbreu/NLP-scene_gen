<L>__{exterior new orleans port day}
<A>__{ mid may, 1841 a white male, fairly smart, with broad shoulders, stands and bellows }
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{clemens...! clemens ray!}
<A>__{we are in the port of new orleans, one of the busiest in the young nation. on the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods are loaded and unloaded from a various ships. it's a bit of controlled chaos as a variety of languages are spoken and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the orleans to a holding pen. solomon, and all the slaves are overwhelmed by all that is happening around them. two men among many are awaiting the arrival of the orleans. they are jonus ray clemens ray's master and davis who is the solicitor of mr. ray. they both look like they mean business. the moment the gangplank is laid, ray yells for clemens. clemens, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight. he is, uncharacteristically beside himself. ironically, his master now represents "freedom."}
<C>__{clemens}
<D>__{...my master... master ray, sir! master ray!}
<A>__{clemens pulls on his chain. as he does so, several other slaves collapse in his effort to reach his master, like dominos.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{who is in charge of this vessel?}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{i am the captain.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i am mr. jonus ray. my solicitor has documentation verifying that the negro named clemens ray is my property.}
<A>__{as he reads papers handed to him by davis:}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{i know nothing of }
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you are ordered by court to return that property immediately, or face charges of thievery.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{my duty is to transport goods. i am not responsible for their origin.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{remove these contraptions!}
<A>__{to his mate:}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{free him!}
<A>__{biddee does as ordered. once free, clemens hugs and sobs over his master as would a lost and then found child.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's all well, now, clemens. you will return home with me.}
<P>__{(to the captain)}
<D>__{consider this notice and warning.}
<A>__{ray, davis and clemens head away. solomon seems both desperate and hopeful of some aid from clemens and ray. but there is none forthcoming. ray and clemens continue on clemens not so much as even looking back in solomon's direction. solomon stands and watches as they fade into the environs and are gone from sight.}
