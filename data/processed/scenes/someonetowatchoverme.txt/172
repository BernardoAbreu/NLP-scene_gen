<A>__{a heavy silence. mike sitting, on duty again. he keeps to himself. he doesn't move from his chair. claire finally enters. she holds tensely, waiting, aware of his mood.}

<A>__{his stare is unyielding.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{claire}

<A>__{he looks up.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(anguished)}
<D>__{i don't know you...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{this is me, mike. there's nothing else...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you don't wash your clothes at the boulevard laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this? a fuckin' joke?}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(beat; sustaining)}
<D>__{okay, then let's make it easy. it was a mistake. don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.}
<A>__{she walks away; mike sits.}
