<L>__{interior diner. day}
<A>__{they're sitting at a table, waiting for their order.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{i don't think they can make it stick, bob. i mean, what do they actually have on future man?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{well, the marijuana crop is a good start.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{that could be anybody's.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{they also found my two beam scale in the garage.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? everybody has a scale.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{the cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{so tell them the truth. what do you use it for?}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i was just going to use it to see how much i had.}
<A>__{dignan mulls this over for a minute.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{how long has he been in there?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{then how come they haven't set the bail yet? that's unconstitutional.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{we'll have to see when we get back.}
<A>__{dignan looks at bob for a minute.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{what do you mean get back?}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well, obviously, we got to go back.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{bob, that makes no sense.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{dignan, he's my brother. i can't just leave him there.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{this could be a trap.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{come on, dignan.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{don't "come on, dignan" me.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i'm going back.}
<C>__{dignan}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{not in that car you're not.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{watch me.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{good luck, since i got the keys.}
<A>__{bob glares at dignan. dignan shrugs. the waitress brings over some glasses of water, ice clinking. nobody says anything while she sets them down. she walks away.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{give me the keys, dignan.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{i can't do that, bob.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{dignan. you're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{don't threaten me, bob.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{goddammit, dignan! it's my car! if you don't give me my keys, i swear to god }
