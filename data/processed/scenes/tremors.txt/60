<L>__{interior pham van's store day}
<A>__{nestor, viola, nancy, and miguel nervously crowd around val, earl, and rhonda. viola holds her yappy dog which perio dically snarls and snaps at people. pham van is on his cb radio trying to contact burt and heather.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{you serious, val? you think we're not even safe here in town?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{ask me that after you meet one. i think we should all get the hell out while the getting's good.}
<C>__{nestor}
<D>__{why not just take a number ten pick axe and give it one good whack...?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{nestor, damn it, these things are bigger than an airstream trailer!}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{god, i've got to find mindy.}
<A>__{nancy rushes out.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{hey, pham, where's burt and heather?}
<C>__{pham van}
<P>__{(hangs up cb)}
<D>__{can't raise them. i guess they're still out there somewhere.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{if you've got a radio, why aren't you calling somebody in bixby? the police or...}
<C>__{pham van}
<D>__{can't reach outside the valley. you know, because of the mountains.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{hey, rhonda, what's the name you call those things, huh?}
<C>__{pham van}
<D>__{where'd they come from?}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{huh? i don't know.}
<C>__{pham van}
<D>__{you're a scientist, right?}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{you should have a theory at least.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{look, these things are absolutely unprecedented!}
<C>__{nestor}
<D>__{yeah, but where'd they come from?}
<C>__{rhonda}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{where'd they come from? okay, worms, probably in the jurassic period. cosmic radiation was much higher then...so they mutated...and they got so big they just sank right into the ground and fell asleep... but now continental drift has brought them to the surface, ready to be harvested by the ancient alien meat growers who planted them here.}
<A>__{everybody stares at her, then they smile, realizing she's pulling their legs.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you're right, don't matter where they come from.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{right. we need to be talking about what we're gonna do.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{my goodness, valentine, once they see the road is out and the phone lines are down, someone will be along to look in on us. don't you think?}
