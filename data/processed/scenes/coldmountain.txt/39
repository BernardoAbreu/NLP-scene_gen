<L>__{exterior chapel, cold mountain town. day}
<A>__{ as a man hammers a tintype of his son's face into the wooden porch of the chapel, where it joins many other portraits of those lost to the war. monroe presides. one of the slaves from black cove holds the ladder for the bereaved father. other families wait, with their own daguerreotype to mount. it's a memorial service without bodies. riders approach. home guard. teague brings his horse up alongside monroe at the chapel door, tips his hat in condolence to the bereaved families. with him is a young, intensely beautiful and flamboyant rider, bosie, his hair long, a single fingernail bizarrely overgrown. somehow sinister.}
<C>__{teague}
<D>__{my condolences to you all.}
<P>__{(he considers the slave)}
<D>__{keep an eye on the negro. they want what the white man got all of you watch out your brave boys give their lives to war and meantime your slaves carry murder, rape and arson to your firesides.}
<C>__{monroe}
<D>__{the only slaves within twenty miles labor on my farm. they're good christians and i will vouchsafe for them.}
