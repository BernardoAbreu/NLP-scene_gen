<A>__{close on an e.c.g. monitor, green lines on black screen. david and alison sit by jennifer's bed. jennifer is unconscious. she has her arm in a cast and a small band aid on her head. otherwise she seems undamaged. kevin is sitting on the end of the bed playing the super nintendo game (the gothic vampire thing, with bats and he men, we saw on jennifer's tv earlier). it is plugged into a t.v. which sits on a trolley. it's quite a noisy game. kevin is immersed in it.}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes. great. kevin, i'11 send bean in to keep you company.}
<A>__{alison exits. david follows. bean enters. he sees jennifer for the first time. sympathy shows in his eyes.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{help me with this. it's a scientific experiment. we're gonna wake up sleeping beauty here with the tortured screams of vampire bats.}
<A>__{bean is determined to help. he sits down with kevin. the game continues. the he man jumps up and down, lashing out at bats with his sword. lots of noise, but jennifer sleeps on.}
