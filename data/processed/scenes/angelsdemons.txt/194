<L>__{ext st. peter's square night}
<A>__{the only sound that remains in the square is a soft night wind. the wounded pick themselves up off the ground. the crowd, realizing the blast is over, turns its attention to the body of the camerlengo, on the far side of the square. langdon and vittoria try to make their way toward him, but the crowd surges past them, and we soar over the heads of the crowd, wanting to get there first, wanting to be the first ones to see his eyes open. he's alive.}
<B>__{wide on the square as}
