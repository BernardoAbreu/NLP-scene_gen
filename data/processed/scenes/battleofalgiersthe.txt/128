<L>__{127 bus shelter. outside. evening.}
<A>__{the people are crowded in a bus shelter. the one who is driving doesn't understand or doesn't want to. the other shouts to him again and again, the same phrase, then flings himself on the steering wheel, and turns it in that direction. the bus shelter is nearer and nearer. the people are paralyzed. they have no time to move. they are run down, rammed into. the ambulance crashes into a pillar. on the ground, all about, the bodies of dead and wounded. the boys' bodies remain motionless, their foreheads resting on the smashed windshield. but the sound of the siren does not stop, and is heard, mournful and full of anguish.}
