<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{the dead body}
<A>__{lying half in, half out of the tub, the head tumbled over, touching the floor, the hair wet, one eye wide open as if popped, one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor. coming down the side of the tub, running thick and dark along the porcelain, we see many small threads of blood. camera follows away from the body, travels slowly across the bathroom, past the toilet, out into the bedroom. as camera approaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as mary placed it on the bedside table. close up the newspaper beside the bed. the camera now moves away over to the window and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we hear, coming from within the house, the sound of norman's fearful, shocked voice.}
<C>__{norman's voice}
<D>__{mother! oh god, what... blood, blood... mother...!}
<A>__{we cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations. after a moment or two of silence, norman emerges from the front door, dashes down the path toward the motel.}
