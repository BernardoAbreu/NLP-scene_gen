<L>__{interior orlando's bed & breakfast day}
<A>__{department store shopping bags and boxes are strewn across the bed. sydney checks herself out in the full length mirror. a man's gray tuxedo jacket over lingerie.}
<L>__{interior lumber mill day}
<A>__{the giant work floor of the abandoned mill. sunlight beams through holes in the roof. max, on roller blades, practices guiding the hockey puck along the floor. he stops when he notices the figure watching him from outside the giant metal doors: luca in the blue dress, on roller blades, hockey stick in hand.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you're about the last person i expected to see.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i can show you a few moves if you want?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{yeah? what the hell.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{luca demonstrates hockey technique, expertly guiding a hockey puck through an obstacle course of broken equipment, timber, and sawdust piles. all the while, she dodges max's attempts to steal the puck. max finally gets it, which riles luca. she hip checks max. they swerve to avoid a pipe, crash landing on top of each other on a sawdust pile. they bust out laughing.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{not bad.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you're better than luke.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i taught him everything he knows.}
<A>__{luca pulls away from max, suddenly self conscious that max's leg is on top of hers. awkward from the broken connection, they gaze up at the blue sky through a hole in the roof.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i thought you left town?}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{had to come back.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{where'd you learn to speak italian?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{just tourist stuff. "i will have the spaghetti bolognese." "how much for a room?"}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{have you been?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{little italy. in new york. someday, though. want to go with me?}
<A>__{max leans over and kisses luca. she responds, tentatively at first, then as she grows more confident,... her face reddens, she gasps. luca pulls back, self conscious, confused. she brushes sawdust off her dress, stands.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{look, this was a mistake.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{yeah. of course. i know.}
<A>__{looking up, luca sees keenan, staring at them from across the floor, incredulous. keenan exits out through the giant doors.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{oh, jesus...}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{are you and he...?}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's really none of my business.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{no! i'm sorry. i shouldn't've come here.}
<A>__{max stands, brushes off the sawdust.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{please don't say you're "just visiting." that you "need to leave." i'm the one who needs to leave.}
<A>__{max skates off across the giant shop floor.}
