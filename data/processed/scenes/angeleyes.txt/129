<L>__{exterior pogue house day}
<A>__{sharon exits and starts to walk away. she sees larry jr. look up from his play. he smiles at her. she returns the smile it means a lot to her, and she walks on. as she reaches the gate, she notices something across the street that halts her. she stops still, surprised and so pleased.}
<B>__{her pov}
<A>__{catch is there, waiting near her car, watching her now. back to scene full shot as sharon walks to him, so glad he's there, needing him but still not sure of what he's feeling about her, until she gets close and sees his eyes and the way he opens his arms and they embrace, and she holds on tight, eyes closed. they break the embrace, still holding on, searching each other's eyes.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{sorry, shar. for what i said.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{me, too.}
<A>__{in a moment, he gestures toward the pogue house.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{was it bad?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{they don't like me in there.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{then they don't deserve you in there.}
<A>__{she stares a moment more, still together.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{that's a nice thing to say.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{it's not a thing to say. it's the truth.}
<A>__{she can only look away, not wanting to cry.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{why do you try so hard not to cry?}
<A>__{she stares at him again. her throat fills with tears, mouth is trembling a bit. she starts quietly, finally, with nothing held back but this is not anger as much as mourning.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{it's not fair.}
<A>__{the tears come, and she doesn't fight them, emptying the old, old wound, speaking through her weeping now. the first time we've seen her cry.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{it's not fair. things got better for them because of what i did. things got better, and i'd still do it. i'd do it all over again. and it's not fair they shut me out. it's not.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{it's not fair. i was 19, and i didn't know what else to do. i didn't know how else to stop it. it's not fair i don't have a family anymore.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{no. it's not, shar. it's not.}
<A>__{he raises his hands to her face, places a palm gently on each cheek, and she covers his hands with her own and closes her eyes. they remain that way awhile. in a moment he lightly kisses her forehead. there is a depth to his words...}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{we're the family, pogo.}
<A>__{she opens her eyes, staring deep into his. he has said it all as it is and as it will be. she smiles a bit through her tears and nods. he puts an arm around her shoulder and holds her tight against him as they walk to her car. she puts an arm around his waist. they reach the car, and she unlocks it, gets in behind the wheel as catch gets into the passenger seat.}
