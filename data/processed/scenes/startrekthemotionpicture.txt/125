<L>__{interior rec deck full on decker and "ilia"}
<A>__{decker waving back toward the general area of the enterprise pictures.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{the crews of the previous enterprises were also carbon units. in what way is the life form in your vessel different? "ilia" carbon units are not true life forms... do those images repre sent how enterprise has evolved into its present form?}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(hoping he's struck a responsive chord)}
<D>__{yes. "ilia" carbon units have clearly retarded enterprise's proper evolvement.}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(controlling surprise)}
<D>__{what is enterprise's proper evolvement? "ilia" enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.}
<A>__{and with this she moves off, observing other rec deck objects. decker moves with her; then:}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units. "ilia" more data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.}
<A>__{across "ilia" to decker as he reacts to this ominous note; he stops abruptly.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{what does that mean? "ilia"}
<P>__{(stopping; almost pleasantly)}
<D>__{when my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.}
<A>__{this has been delivered with chilling blandness, and she stands facing decker, almost as though waiting for him to thank her. he thinks fast now.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. if i can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better. "ilia" that is logical. you may procede.}
<B>__{on decker}
<A>__{realizing the difficult task ahead; the pain he will suffer.}
