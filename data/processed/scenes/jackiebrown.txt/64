<L>__{interior cockatoo inn day}
<A>__{jackie explaining the plan to ordell.}
<C>__{jacki}
<D>__{... i make two deliveries. the first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. they watch it. see how it works. then we do a second delivery, when i bring in the half mill.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{naw, naw, that's too much exposure. i ain't goin anywhere near that money.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you don't have to. i told 'em you're real careful. you never pick up money yourself. you always send someone, and i never know who it is.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{that's a good idea.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{if you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. the first time i do it they're lurking about. they see me hand the ten thousand to someone.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i don't know. one of your friends.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{a woman.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{if you want.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{yeah, i think a woman.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{the next trip, when i come with all the money, it'll look like i hand it to the same one i did before...}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{but you don't?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{no, i give it to someone else first.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{and they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's the idea.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{so we need two people, two women.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{can you cover that?}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{i got the woman covered. where you thinkin' about doin' this?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i was thinkin' the del amo mall. in the food court.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{i suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{well, it's my plan. we're in this together.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{yeah, but it's my money, and i don't need me a partner.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i ain't your partner, i'm your manager. i'm managing to get your money out of mexico, into america, in your hands, and i'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. that makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{managers get ten percent.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's an agent. manager's get fifteen percent.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{i will give ya ten.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{plus the same deal as before.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{i can do that.}
<A>__{they clink their glasses together.}
<B>__{closeup digital clock}
<A>__{it flips to 11:00 p.m. it's now getting late at night. jackie comes home. she's dressed differently than she was at the cockatoo. in fact, she looks like she's coming home from a date. she walks into her bedroom... kicks off her shoes... takes her earring off, putting them on the night stand by the bed... she sees that her answering machine is flashing. she hits play. we begin a slow zoom into the answering machine. never seeing jackie again. the machine voice says;}
