<L>__{interior break room}
<A>__{derek enters, opens the refrigerator and takes out a lunch bag. he hears a slight sniffling noise, turns and is surprised to find lisa seated a corner table, a little tearful. lisa looks up, quickly wipes her eyes with her hand and puts on a smile.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{sorry. i thought everybody was at lunch.}
<A>__{an awkward moment. lisa starts to rise.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{i should go...}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{no. stay. i was just gonna take this back to my office.}
<A>__{lisa sits back down. derek starts to leave; hesitates.}
<C>__{derek }
<D>__{anything i can do to help? i mean... if you want to talk about it.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{it's nothing.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{most people i know don't cry over nothing.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{( with humor)}
<D>__{you think i was crying? this is just my allergies.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{uh huh. what are you allergic to?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{men, apparently. actually it's more like they're allergic to me.}
<P>__{(}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{boyfriend trouble?}
<A>__{lisa hesitates, wondering if she can confide.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{it's stupid really.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{this guy i've been seeing just calls and dumps me. middle of the day. no warning. no explanation. just "i don't think we should see each other anymore."}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{ouch!!! that's pretty cold. how long were you together?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{two months.}
<P>__{small laugh)}
<D>__{actually, it was one of my longer lasting relationships. i don't know what it is but sooner or later i just seem to scare men off.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm starting to think there's something wrong with me.}
<A>__{derek sits down beside her. he puts a comforting hand on her shoulder.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(like a big brother)}
<D>__{nothing wrong with you. your boyfriend's a fool, that's all.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i wish i could believe that.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{maybe you just haven't met the right guy yet.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i'm beginning to think all the good ones are taken. d}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{look, i'm no expert but if it didn't work out, maybe it wasn't meant to be. when the right guy comes along... you'll know it.}
<A>__{she looks up at him; smiles.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{is that how it was with you and beth?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{actually, yeah. we both knew pretty quick.}

<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{she's got it all. perfect husband, perfect child, perfect marriage.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{nobody's perfect. there are problems in every relationship. the important thing is to keep moving forward.}
<P>__{trying to buck her up)}
<D>__{don't get down on yourself. you're a bright, attractive girl. any man would be lucky to have you.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{oh, yeah. right.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{no, really. if i was single...}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{but you're not.}

<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(encouraging)}
<D>__{hang in there. it'll happen.}
<A>__{lisa nods. she smiles and exits. ncident forgotten, derek opens his lunch bag and takes out a sandwich. ben appears in the doorway, grins at derek.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what was that all about?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{poor kid got dumped by her boyfriend.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{really? i wouldn't mind taking up the slack. that is one hot piece of ass there.}
<P>__{(off derek's look)}
<D>__{like you haven't noticed.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{hey, i'm a happily married man. and so are you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{doesn't mean we can't look.}
<A>__{ben goes to the refrigerator, opens it and starts rooting around.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{not like the old days, back when you could get away with a little office nookie on the side and not get nailed for it.}
<P>__{(turns and gives him a grin)}
<D>__{don't give me that "i'm appalled" look. that's how you got together with beth, isn't it?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{ben, if you're looking to start something with that girl...}
<P>__{(}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you saw her first?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{fuck off.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{besides, i don't think i'm her type. now you on the other hand...}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{ben, do me a favor...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{all i'm just sayin' is a lot of these single gals see the work place as a hunting ground.}
<P>__{cocking his finger like a gun)}
<D>__{and this one's got you in the cross hairs.}
<A>__{with a grin, ben "pulls the trigger bang!" and exits. derek looks a little annoyed. c}
