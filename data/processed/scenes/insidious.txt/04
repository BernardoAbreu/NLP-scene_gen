<A>__{eyes flick open. a woman blinks awake, gazing around the room. another bedroom. sparse. just a bed and a cabinet. it is 5.43 am. her eyes settle on the man lying next to her in the dark. his heaving snores have woken her up. she is renai (pronounced renee) lambert (36). with a quiet determination she is holding on to her youthful good looks, but the lines of age are creeping in. she has settled into the `comfort' years of a marriage: hair pinned up messily, wearing dowdy pajamas. she beholds her husband, taking him in. considering him. he snorts and smacks his lips. very unflattering. she climbs out of bed.}
