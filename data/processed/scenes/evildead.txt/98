<A>__{the sound of ticking catches ashly's attention. he looks up to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back wards. he watches and waits tensely. turning carefully, ashly tries to monitor all the windows. the ticking grows louder. a shadow passes in the window before him and he fires, shattering the glass into a million pieces. wind whips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the floor. ashly waits, leaning against the front door for something to happen. he is tense and more determined than ever to survive. he whispers to himself.}

<D>__{c'mon, c'mon, get it over with, why are you torturing me like this?}
<A>__{placing his hand to his side, ashly discovers something in his pocket. he lifts it to his eyes. it is linda's necklace.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{...linda. (he whispers)}
<A>__{the ticking stops. he tilts his head for the slightest sound. all is silent. from behind, two arms rip through the door and grab him. ashly tears away and falls to the floor. the necklace is tossed away in the confusion. cheryl's hands pull away and she looks through a hole in the door. from the floor, ashly raises his rifle and fires at her head.}
