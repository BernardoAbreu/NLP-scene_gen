<C>__{parker}
<D>__{we've got five hours. relax.}
<A>__{he fires up the lincoln and off they go. drew now has a pretty clear inclination as to what's going on. she leans into her sister and whispers.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{this was supposed to be someone else's car, wasn't it?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{just then, bennie tosses the sign, which he'd stashed on the dash, onto the seat next to him, face up so drew can read:}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{'scarpelli'? we're supposed to be italian?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{northern italian.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{this is so... wrong.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what? you need to get to that interview. we now have a ride. we will pay for the ride. end of big deal.}
<A>__{this is when bennie's cell phone rings and he answers it.}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{yeah?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no. the city.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what'a you talkin' about?}
<A>__{bennie glances into the rearview mirror, smiling at the girls...}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{i already got 'em.}
<A>__{... but his smile turns down at the corners as he listens. the girls exchange doubtful looks. it gets worse.}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{they're right here in the car.}
<P>__{(to girls)}
<D>__{'scuse me.}
<A>__{bennie raises the privacy glass but doesn't realize he's left the intercom button on so they can still hear his half of the conversation. the girls are petrified.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(low to drew)}
<D>__{not good.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(swallowing)}
<D>__{what's happening?}
<C>__{bennie}
<P>__{(to phone)}
<D>__{don't you think that's a little severe? i mean, they didn't see nothin' yet. they can't hear nothin'.}
<A>__{yes they can and they're now scared as hell.}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{you're the boss.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{take it easy. i will fix it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no, i don't have a shovel. not today. it'll be a big mess. besides, i just had this suit cleaned.}
<A>__{the girls want out of this car!}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{i will take 'em to the wharf, what difference does it make?}
<A>__{drew yanks out her inhaler and sucks on it.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(whispered terror)}
<D>__{parker, i think maybe we should get out.}
<A>__{parker sees the light ahead turn red.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i agree. how about... now!}
<A>__{just as bennie brakes for the light, parker throws her door open and pulls drew into the street! an oncoming buick locks up its brakes as they dash for the sidewalk.}
<C>__{bennie }
<D>__{hey?! where you goin'?!}
