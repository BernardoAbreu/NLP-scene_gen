<L>__{exterior pov of an airplane}
<A>__{flying over american heartland. we see the earth through the pilot's perspective as sky and ground swap positions, the plane swooping down and storming over the ground.}
<B>__{the plane}
<A>__{is a biplane, racing over a field lush with young plants. it releases a trail of crop spray, and climbs again... up into a crystalline blue sky where sunshine pours like honey over family farms stretching to the horizon. maybe it's not heaven, maybe it's just tennessee. but as long as there's been an america, men have fought and died for this place as volunteers. far off, but visible from the plane is a barn day the barn is unpainted except for hand lettering that says "mccawley crop dusting." another plane noise, this one made by kids, brings us to two boys, sitting in the shell of an old plane propped on crates, scavenged of it's engine, seats, and wheels. the boys sit in it's cockpit, butts crowded onto the nail keg they've replaced the seat with. they've even attached a 2x4 as propeller, as if their imaginations needed any help. they wear overalls and have bowl haircuts: rafe and danny, 10 years old.}

<D>__{it's germans!}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{kill the bastards!}
<A>__{rafe looks at danny in shock then they both laugh and go right back into their game, manufacturing their own machine gun and engine sounds.}

<D>__{there's another one!}
<A>__{their vocal motors roar again... but a man's hand grabs danny by the straps of his overalls and jerks him from the cockpit. it's danny's father and he's a fearsome sight; drunk, his hair uncombed, his face unshaven, his teeth those still left are rotting. he's also missing an arm; but the one that's left is potent, and he's shaking danny with it.}
<C>__{danny's father}
<D>__{you no count boy! johnson come lookin', said he'd pay a dime for you to shovel his pig shed, and i can't find you no place.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{daddy, i told you i was comin' here.}
<A>__{his father slaps him off his feet. rafe is so horrified he can't get a sound out. danny isn't even surprised. but when his father snatches him up again, twisting the overall straps so tight they choke him, he struggles. it does no good; his father starts marching across the field, dragging and strangling danny.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{da!... dad...}
<A>__{the father's drunken anger makes him oblivious until crack! the 2x4 propeller slams him across the back, knocking him to the ground and making him drop danny. the father rolls over to see 10 year old rafe, holding the}

<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{i will bust you open, you...german!}
<A>__{the words ring something deep in the man's booze broken brain. he begins to cough, convulsively; it brings a blossom of blood to his mouth. he wipes it with his hand, but blood clings to his teeth. he chokes out }
<C>__{danny's father}
<D>__{i fought the germans.}
<A>__{he looks at danny in shame, with the realization of what he's just done. he turns and staggers away. danny looks at rafe a communication between boys joined by something deeper than blood. then danny runs off after his father.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{daddy! daddy! wait.}
<A>__{danny catches him, takes his father's hand, and walks away with him. the crop duster we saw in the air has just landed, behind rafe. the pilot, rafe's father, shuts off the engine.}

<D>__{what's goin' on, son?}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{nothing. danny's dad just come to get him.}

<C>__{rafe's father}
<D>__{hey, boy you wanna go up?}
<A>__{rafe can't believe it; he runs to the plane and hops into his father's lap. as his father cranks the engine and tucks him into the harness, rafe says }

<D>__{hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the ground...cause i got no limits in the air!}

<A>__{from rafe and danny's pov, the rush is awesome. the pilots on the ground watch in awe as the p 40's get so close they can't possibly get out of each other's way. billy, the most boyish faced of the pilots, yells to drown out the sound of the collision... at the last instant, both planes snap a quarter turn so that their wings are vertical, and they shoot past each other belly to belly.}
