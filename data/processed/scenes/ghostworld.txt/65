<L>__{interior seymour's room evening}
<A>__{enid presents seymour with a hostess cupcake with a single lit candle in the center. the lights are off.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{you can open your eyes now.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{oh... uh, thanks a lot enid... i really appreciate it...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{no, doofus... blow it out!}
<A>__{he leans forward and blows out the candle, then abruptly straightens up and holds the small of his back in pain. enid turns the lights back on.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{arrrghhh! ah jeez... christ...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{it's just my stupid back. i will be all right in a minute...}
<A>__{she notices him adjust something under his shirt.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{oh... uh... it's just this elastic thing i have to wear for lumbar support...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what, like a girdle?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{maybe now you understand why i can't get a date.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{yeah, well, you're not the only one. everybody i know has totally fucked up problems... it seems like only stupid people have good relationships...}
<C>__{seymour}
<P>__{(sarcastically cheering her on)}
<D>__{that's the spirit!}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i mean, i'm eighteen years old and i've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{never...}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i'm starting to think that even if i did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i know. it's not like it makes all your problems go away.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{then again, that's easy for me to say, since i will never even get a date. i'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{actually, i've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked up situation...}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{oh wait, you met him... remember that guy josh? i'm like practically obsessed with him, but i can't do anything about it because becky would freak out.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{never mind, it's way too complicated...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{did you have problems like this when you were my age where you're totally confused all the time?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i won't even dignify that with a response.}
<A>__{he gets up and looks through his shelves for a record.}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(looking at his records)}
<D>__{i wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?}
<C>__{seymour}
<P>__{(a sore subject)}
<D>__{who knows?}
<A>__{the phone rings. seymour ignores it.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{aren't you going to get that?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{let the machine get it. i have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...}
<A>__{after several more rings the machine picks up and we hear seymour's message. after the beep there's a long fumbling pause...}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i knew it... it's my mother.}
<C>__{voice on machine}
<D>__{uh... hi! uh... i'm calling for... um... you placed an ad in the weekly over a month ago and... well, i'm the redhead in the yellow dress... at least i think i am... i saw the ad when you first placed it but i was in this relationship at the time so i cut it out, and now i'm not in the relationship anymore...}
<P>__{(giggles)}
<D>__{god, this is really confusing... anyway, if you still want to talk to me i can be reached at kl5 2603, that's my work number and my name is dana... um... bye!}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{wow!}
<P>__{(feigning ignorance)}
<D>__{what was that all about?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{it's just somebody's idea of a joke...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{that didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?}
<C>__{seymour}
<P>__{(still confused)}
<D>__{uh yeah. a long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{seymour! i promise you that wasn't a joke you have to call her back!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{how can you be so sure?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{well, uh... i'm an expert about stuff like this she was totally for real!}
