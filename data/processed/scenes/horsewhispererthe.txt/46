<A>__{annie pulls up in a range rover and stops. grace moves for the door. annie asks respectfully;}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{do you want any help?}
<A>__{grace doesn't even bother to answer. she manages to get onto the pavements, then turns for her bag... annie notices other kids looking at grace from behind, as they enter the school.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{dad'll pick you up today, all right?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{grace looks up to her mother. what is unspoken between them is the understanding that today will be difficult and there's nothing either one can do about it.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you'll be fine.}
<A>__{grace nods and turns to the school. annie watches her go.}
