<L>__{interior carol's apartment building door hallway day}
<A>__{carol opens the door just as he arrives on her landing. she holds a container of ice, washclothes and a thermometer.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i'm hungry.}
<P>__{(on carol's astonished look)}
<D>__{you've upset my whole day. i haven't eaten.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<A>__{melvin ignores the question, instead answering a charge he had imagined she might make...}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{this is not a sexist thing. if you were a waiter i would still be here saying...}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{are you totally gone? this is my private home...}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i am trying to keep emotions out of this. even though this is an important issue to me and i have strong feelings about the subject.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{what subject? that i wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{yes, i do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it i have not gotten personal and you have. why aren't you at work? you're not sick you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{my son is sick, okay?}
<A>__{even saying the sentence, "my son is sick" pushes some emotions toward the surface which are wasted on the crazy man at her threshold.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{what about your mother?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{how do you know about my mother?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i hear you talk when i'm waiting!!!}
<A>__{she crosses to the sink to dump the ice. melvin takes a step inside. spencer, seven and looking ill, walks into the room.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{sorry, honey... i will be right there.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(uncomfortably)}
<D>__{how ya doing?}
<A>__{spencer just stares at him.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(miffed)}
<D>__{you should answer when someone talks to you...}
<A>__{carol eyes melvin with disgust and disbelief then emphatically gestures him to "clear out." melvin backs out the door.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{sorry. there is a limit, melvin, and i can't handle you teaching my son manners.}
<A>__{she closes the door in his face, then walks to her son and leads him back to his room.}
