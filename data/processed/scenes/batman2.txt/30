<L>__{exterior prison main entrance day}
<A>__{it's fifteen degrees outside as mr. boniface aka the penguin waddles forth from the prison gates, regally attired in cutaway and pin stripes. he pauses to inhale a deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of exhilaration, he removes his coat and stretches spreading his wings, reveling in the cold. a stretch limo pulls up. two identically gaunt and vulture like dandies, formally dressed, with bowler hats and umbrellas, step out to meet him. these two gentlemen frick and frack serve as the penguin's general factoti and "business managers."}
