<A>__{the interior is a cramped and never ending maze of hallways, passageways and doors which connect the many rooms and compartments within the compound. sturdy, but prefabricated materials have been used in its construction. there is a laboratory. an infirmary. a kitchen and mess hall. a communications room and sleeping quarters. other cubicles are for storage and supplies. the most spacious area of the building, and the main center of activity, is the rec room. of the many entrance ways to this room can be seen the small work chambers with their sophisticated computers and other scientific equipment. the below quarter houses the generator and still other compartments for storage. a long underground tunnel connects the main compound to the dog kennel.}

<A>__{a large, almost snow covered building. not far from that a tall, meteorological balloon tower. a scattering of several small shacks at varying distances from the main compound. the smaller hovels are connected by wooden planked walkways and steadying ropes. multicolored pennants stick put of the snow marking pathways and directions to outdoor experiments. a tractor and two helicopters sit idle, covered with mounds of continuously mounting snow. two men, norris and bennings standing some thirty yards from the main building are in the process of letting up a large red balloon. childs, a hefty black man, is twenty yards away tinkering with a snowmobile. their beards are caked with ice. it is winter and it is harsh. the faint sound of the copter turns their attention.}

<D>__{what the fu...}
<A>__{blam! blam! the crazed visitor screams and fires as he stalks after them. his countenance ablaze, mad. ice and snow kick up about the terrified americans. a bullet smacks into the dog's hip, sending it skidding and howling in pain. childs, the black man by the snowmobile, takes cover, diving behind his machine. bennings is hit. norris pulls, drags him back toward the compound. the dog crawls along beside them. the intruder is relentless in his assail. he runs, screaming, firing, screaming, reloading and firing.}
<L>__{interior compound}
<A>__{total confusion. some watch helplessly through the small, fogged up and translucent windows. others try to mobilize grabbing for their heavy jackets. close on a .357 magnum as it efficiently breaks through a windowpane and into the cold. a steady hand grips it firmly.}

<D>__{rook to knight six. check.}
<A>__{more impatient pounding. macready glares at his opponent for a beat. he bends forward, opens up a flap containing the chess game's circuitry and pours in his drink. there ensues a snapping, popping sound as smoke and sparks rise from the machine; followed by a flush of chess gibberish. macready gets up from his seat, mumbling on his way to the door.}
<C>__{macready}

<L>__{exterior norwegian camp}
<A>__{smoke climbs upward in the f.g. macready sets his craft down. pull back to reveal the camp itself: resembling the aftermath of a western fort, sacked and ravaged by indians. small fires and debris are strewn everywhere. the prefab administration building exposes gaping holes. smoke rises from the almost entirely snow buried quonset huts. embers swirl in every direction.}
<L>__{interior chopper}
<A>__{the two men look at each other in silence. they get out. close on a large, makeshift funeral pyre smoldering to a close. a hastily conceived crematorium. wood, books, furniture, tires, anything that will burn has been mixed together with the charred remains of several dogs and the body of a man. curious mounds of a melted and blackened goo are heaped within the mess. a small can of gasoline lies nearby. a large oil drum not far off.}
<B>__{macready and copper}

<D>__{anybody there?!}
<A>__{no answer. just wind. they exchange a look and enter.}
<L>__{interior narrow corridor}
<A>__{the two men move slowly. it is dank and cold. their breath, bleating like exhaust. a soft, steady wind howls overhead. the flashlight is not much help. further down, they hear a faint hissing sound. as they get closer it more resembles static. the flashlight finds a door at the end of the corridor. the sputtering static comes from within. the face of the door has been shredded. an ax sticks out from its middle. macready wrenches out the ax. there is blood on it. the men acknowledge this for a beat. macready tries the knob. it opens slightly. something is blocking it from the other side.}
<C>__{macready}

<C>__{macready}
<D>__{give me a hand.}
<A>__{they push, shove, grunt. the door gives a bit. finally more. it widens enough for macready to see that a large computer like machine is blocking their path. macready wedges in and shines the flashlight. it is the communications room. holes in its roof have allowed in the freezing cold. the flashlight exposes the back of the radio chair. one more nudge allows them into the room. a beat as they catch their breath. macready spots a coleman lantern. he lights it with a match. holds it up. the brighter light exposes the top of a man's head sitting in the radio chair.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{hey, sweden...! you okay?}
<A>__{the chair rocks slightly with the gentle breeze. they inch closer. a yard from the chair, macready stops the doctor. he pokes his gun at the chair's back.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{sweden?!}
<A>__{dr. copper spots something. from the man's wrist on the armrest, he follows a long, yarn thick, red line, ending in a pool of frozen blood on the floor. the two men step around the chair. the norwegian stares up in blanched death. a gaping black hole for a mouth. his throat and wrists slit. an old fashioned straight razor in his lap. macready turns off the hissing radio, and marches to the other door. it is locked and barricaded.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<P>__{(more to himself)}
<D>__{my god, what in hell happened here?}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{come on, copper.}
<A>__{the two men free a machine like obstacle from the other exit. macready opens a lock and pushes the door open. more blackness. stronger wind. copper holds the lantern high as they make their way down a row of wooden steps and into a cavernous, underground causeway.}

<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{they're not swedish, goddamn it, they're norwegian, macre }
<A>__{whap!! something slaps into the doctor's face from the darkness. the lantern crashes to the ground. the doctor stumbles, falls. macready grabs the flashlight and whirls in different directions. a panting beat. silence. dr. copper holds up what hit him. a thick centerfold, buffeted by the wind. macready takes it.}

<L>__{interior the narrowest of corridors}
<A>__{the supporting beams have long since buckled and cracked from the constantly moving ice underneath. the evidence of fire has further weakened the foundations. the wood creaks overhead. bits of ice and silt trickle down. the two men walk hunched, cautious. macready gingerly tries to make his way around a broken and smoldering beam. he brushes it gently sending a shower of debris from the yawning roof. the two men wait until it subsides and then moves on. further down. macready's knee bumps into something along the wall, causing him to stumble slightly. he shines his light on it. an arm is sticking out of a steel door about three feet off the ground. the door has been slammed shut. the arm pinned, its fist still gripping a small welding torch. the flame long since gone out.}

<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{watch it.}
<A>__{his grip is too strong. it gives suddenly, unexpectedly. the large metal door flies open. large chunks splash from the ceiling. they come thumping to the floor, behind and in front of the open cabinet door. macready coughs and waves away the dust. he peers inside. nothing much. some empty shelves. some small scientific gear. his flashlight then locates a large photograph taped to the inside of the cabinet door. it is a picture of five norwegians, arm in arm, all smiles, toasting each other. they are on either side of the frozen block of ice, pridefully displaying it for the camera. the block looks much thicker. its interior opaque. macready looks to the block of ice and then back to the photograph. he untapes it, pockets it and shuts the door. an armless corpse swings into his face from behind the closing door. dislodged from the ceiling, the body and macready go crashing to the floor.}
