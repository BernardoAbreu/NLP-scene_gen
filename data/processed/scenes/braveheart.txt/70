<L>__{interior scottish council day}
<A>__{the nobles of scotland are gathered in the huge chamber; a massive table runs across the far end of the room, and aligned on either side are the two rival factions of nobles, glaring at each other. old craig is in the center, with young robert the bruce on his right. there is a general murmur along the nobles, and robert whispers to craig...}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{does anyone know his politics?}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{no. but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. the balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.}
<A>__{a court stewards steps in and formally announces...}
<C>__{steward}
<D>__{lords of scotland: sir william wallace!}
<A>__{the nobles on each side of the table try to outdo each other in their acclamation as wallace strides in, flanked by hamish, campbell, and stephen, splendid in their tartans. old craig rises.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{sir william. in the name of god, we declare and appoint thee high protector of scotland! and thy captains as aides decamp!}
<A>__{the nobles rise; court attendants hurry to wallace and drape a golden chain of office around his neck. wallace takes the three smaller chains they bring and drapes them around the necks of his friends, as once again the nobles applaud. almost before the applause dies, a member of the balliol clan, who has kept an open seat beside him, speaks up...}
<C>__{balliol}
<D>__{sir william!! inasmuch as you and your captains hail from a region long known to support the balliol clan, may we invite you to join us?}
<A>__{but wallace's gaze has locked onto robert the bruce, who stares back, the two young lions instantly recognizing the leadership power of each other.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{you are robert the bruce.}
<C>__{robert the bruce}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{my father fought in support of yours.}
<A>__{the balliols shrivel. the nobles on the bruce side can barely keep from grinning. suddenly the men on the other end of the table change their attack.}
<C>__{balliol}
<D>__{with this new success, the result of all of scotland's efforts, now is the time to declare a king!}
<C>__{mornay}
<D>__{then you are prepared to recognize our legitimate succession!}
<C>__{balliol}
<D>__{you're the ones who won't support the true claim! i demand consideration of these documents!}
<A>__{wallace glances again at the bruce, who suddenly feels ashamed of the bickering.}
<C>__{mornay}
<D>__{those were lies when they were written! our documents prove absolutely that }
<A>__{suddenly wallace turns his back and walks toward the door.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{sir william! where are you going?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{we have beaten the english! but they'll come back, because you won't stand together. there is one clan in this country scotsmen. one class free. one price courage.}
<A>__{he turns again and strides toward the door.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{but... what will you do?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i will invade england. and defeat the english on their own ground.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{invade?! that's impossible, it }
<A>__{wallace slings out his broadsword and moves down the length of the table, bashing the succession documents into the laps of the nobles.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{listen to me! longshanks understands this! this!}
<A>__{he brandishes the broadsword.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{there is a difference between us. you think the people of this country exist to provide you with position. i think your position exists to provide the people with freedom. and i go to make sure they have it.}
<A>__{wallace bangs through the door. suppressing smiles, his friends file out behind him.}
