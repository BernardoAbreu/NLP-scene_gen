<A>__{we see him entering the departure lounge and boarding the plane.}
<L>__{interior delta airplane day}
<A>__{a shot of him as he smiles rather nicely at a very attractive young stewardess as he walks down the aisle of the plane. he is not a crass or lewd flirt, but life comes into his face when he sees a pretty girl he seems to have a real affection for girls: toward men he is polite but rather dry and ironic, almost aloof, but girls he likes. we see him sit in a seat, open his travel bag and take out long galley sheets. he stares for a moment rather wearily at the galleys, then sighs, puts on reading glasses and begins to make corrections as boarding passengers walk by in the aisle. something or someone disturbs him, he looks up with a slight frown and cut to : a pov shot of dave wilkie, all wonder and enthusiasm. this over the titles and we do not hear the dialogue they speak, what we heard is louis armstrong, but i will put the dialogue in here so the actors can act it. we do not want to hear it, the sense of what they are saying will be obvious from the acting.}
