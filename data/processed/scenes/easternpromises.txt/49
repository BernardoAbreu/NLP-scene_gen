<D>__{nikolai is fucking the girl, who is now silent. she is on all fours, registering no emotion. kirill is leaning against the wall, drinking wine from the bottle, watching nikolai with burning eyes, his lust and drunken jealousy mixing together. nikolai grits his teeth and comes inside the girl. kirill whoops and whistles and begins to applaud. the girl is still silent, expressionless.}

<D>__{you did ok! you did ok.}

<D>__{yeah? nikolai glares at kirill.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{well if my examination is over, get the fuck out of here while i get dressed. kirill grins and offers the girl an elaborate bow before leaving. finally alone, nikolai gently helps the girl to lie down. she is numb. he covers her up with a blanket then begins to pull on his clothes. the girl is staring up at the ceiling. after a few moments she begins to sing a russian folk song softly under her breath. nikolai speaks to her softly in russian.}
