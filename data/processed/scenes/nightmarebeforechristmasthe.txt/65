<A>__{sally lands on the street outside sprawled, torn apart, stuffing flowing out, stitches burst. in a moment, she flops upright. she pulls out the needle, the thread, threads the needle and, glancing every so often over her shoulder at the evil scientist's house, hurriedly proceeds to sew herself back together again. the job done. she stashes the needle and thread and wobbly (her stitches are looser than the doctor's) gets to her feet to go only she's sewed one of her legs on backwards so that when she takes a step, her legs walk in opposite directions and she falls right over. she lets out a little moan of frustration. swivelling, she looks back at the house, afraid of getting caught... she works even faster now, ripping out the stitches on the leg she replaced backwards and basting it back on facing forwards. these stitches are really huge and ungainly. still, they're substantial enough to allow her to get to her feet and totter away, though limping rather badly.}
