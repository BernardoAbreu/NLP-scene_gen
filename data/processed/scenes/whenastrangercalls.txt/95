<L>__{interior a room night}
<A>__{this is the children's bedroom in dr. mandrakis' house of six years ago. it is dark. two small beds occupy one corner of the room. we can see two small lumps on the beds, but no more. duncan sits in the foreground with a telephone on his lap. he is dialing a number. the phone rings three times before it is answered or rather, picked up, because there is no voice on the other end. after several seconds the phone is hung up. duncan hangs up and thinks for a moment. he picks up the phone and dials again. this time he gets a busy signal. he hangs up, stands and goes to the door. he opens it slowly, peers out. jill's voice can be heard faintly talking to the operator, asking for the police. duncan closes the door and comes back into the room, mumbling. he goes to the window, looks out. then he goes to the children's beds. closeup duncan as he raises the covers and stares down into the camera.}
