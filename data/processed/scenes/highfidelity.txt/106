<L>__{interior record store day}
<A>__{rob enters the already open store, in a bad mood, to find barry putting up a poster. it reads: "barrytown appearing saturday night bucktown pub"}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what the fuck is that?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{my band.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what band?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{the band that found me and asked me to join.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you are not in a band, barry. you are not a musician. and no posters.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{thanks for your support, rob. really appreciate it.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{barrytown. barrytown? is there no end to your arrogance?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{i didn't make up the name. it's the steely dan song. and it was in the commitments.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you can't be called barry and sing in a group called barrytown.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{they were fucking called that before i was in it, okay? it wasn't my idea.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{that's why you got the gig, isn't it?}
<A>__{barry says nothing.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{isn't it?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{that was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. but }
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{great! that's fucking great! they only asked you to sing because of your name! you can stick it above the browser racks over there.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{how many tickets can i put you down for?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{none. christ!}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{you're not even coming?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{of course i'm not coming. do i look like i'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave? where is it?}
<P>__{(looks at the poster)}
<D>__{the fucking bucktown pub? ha!}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{so much for friends, then. you're a bitter bastard, rob, you know that?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{bitter? because i'm not in barrytown? you should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.}
<P>__{(re: the poster)}
<D>__{just keep that out of my window.}
