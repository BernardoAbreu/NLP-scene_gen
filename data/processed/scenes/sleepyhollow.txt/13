<D>__{this is such a silly game.}
<C>__{brom}
<D>__{be a sport and stop complaining.}
<A>__{the woman moves to brom's voice. he backs away, flanked by peers glenn and theodore. children laugh. ichabod enters, clearing his throat. no one notices. the blindfolded woman keeps grasping. one little girl sees ichabod and goes to him, finger to her lips.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{play along. you must.}
<A>__{she tugs him. before ichabod can protest, he is placed in the blindfolded woman's grip.}

<D>__{there, i have someone. am i finished?}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{you have to tell who it is.}

<D>__{i... i am looking for baltus van tassel.}
<C>__{brom}
<D>__{we haven't heard your name yet, friend.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{well, unless your name is baltus, you should not worry over mine.}

<D>__{they're only children, father.}
<A>__{baltus snorts, then exits with ichabod. the others huddle to gossip, except katrina, who moves beside lady van tassel to watch ichabod and baltus walk down the hall.}
