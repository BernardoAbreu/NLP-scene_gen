<A>__{in the kitchen, drink in hand, a look of grief on his face. he struggles to control himself, puts a hand over his eyes, then pulls himself together, turns from the kitchen.}

<A>__{on willcox hillyer and daddy as the former walks up with his refreshed drink and sits down. he is in control now, his face is expressionless and he is seemingly calm.}

<D>__{well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. a hell of a loop.}
<C>__{daddy}

<D>__{i know. you loved her. so did i. it was an awful shock to me, too. an awful shock. rose was so alive it's hard to believe.}

<D>__{i can't believe it, daddy. i know it must be true, but i can't believe it.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{it's true, son. the girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,}
<A>__{daddy pauses, in trouble emotionally, but gets a grip on himself and in an almost dispassionate manner; but powerful feeling is behind his words.}
<C>__{daddy }
<D>__{she got cancer of the breast, was operated on and had a seven year recovery, then after a brief illness passed on in her sleep, as the man with whom she'd lived in beautiful love and harmony for twenty five years held her hand. that is what happened, son, and god rest her lovely soul!}
