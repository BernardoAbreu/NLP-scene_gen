<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior sue's apartment hollywood boulevard evening}
<A>__{first of all, sue is a guy , and a tough guy at that. he is wearing an l.a. kings home jersey. his sweater bears the sacred number "99". sue is lounging in front of the tv in army surplus khaki cutoffs and untied doc martin boots. sue brushes back a shock of straight, greasy, dirty blonde hair as not to obscure his view of the screen. his face glows with the reflection of the sega hockey game on the set. sue and trent are locked in a heavily contested battle of motor reflexes. nothing moves but their eyes, thumbs, and mouths...}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{bitch... you little bitch!}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{chelios to roenick...!}
<A>__{mike looks on. he is more captivated with the simulated sporting event than the clippers game on the tv across the room. electric guitars blaze over the stereo. the room, like the guys, could use a spring cleaning. pizza boxes, beer bottles, and full, full ashtrays. you can taste the smoke.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{you little bitch!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{hey sue. gretsky's on his ass again.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{because he's a bitch.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{that's so bullshit. this is so bullshit.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you should play another team. the kings are bitches in this game.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{hey, man. i took the kings to the cup .}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{... against the computer .}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{they're a finesse team...}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{they're a bitch team... score ! roenick !}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{fuck !!! that is so bullshit !}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{give it up, sue.}
<A>__{the phone rings. sue picks it up and balances it on his shoulder as he plays.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{hello?}
<P>__{(re: game)}
<D>__{shit !}
<P>__{(back to phone)}
<D>__{yeah. the elevator doesn't work.}
<P>__{(he lets the phone drop. then to mike)}
<D>__{it's pink dot. buzz him in hit nine.}
<A>__{mike picks up the phone off the matted shag carpet. he pushes "9", listens, then hangs up.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{i wish the game still had fights so i could bitch slap wayne.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{this version doesn't have fighting?}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{no. doesn't that suck?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what? that was the best part of the old game.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{i don't know. i guess kids were hitting each other or something.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{you could make their heads bleed, though.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{yeah... if you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{it's kinda money, actually.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{make someone bleed.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{no, man, we're in the play offs.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{i will make gretsky bleed, the little bitch.}
<A>__{the delivery man knocks on the door.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{pause it.}
<P>__{(trent pauses the game)}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{give me the money. i will get it.}
<A>__{while sue gives mike the money, trent unpauses the game and checks gretsky into the boards, leaving him writhing in a pool of red pixels.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{you bitch !}
<A>__{sue dives onto trent. they wrestle a little too rambunctiously for indoors. trent pulls the hockey sweater over sue's head and starts wailing on his back. mike crosses. the camera follows him down a shallow hallway to the door. he unlocks it. a delivery man of eastern hemispheric decent is out of breath from four flights of stairs. he hands mike a twelve pack of bud cans and three packs of marlboro reds. he can hear, but not see, the chaos ensuing in the living room.}
