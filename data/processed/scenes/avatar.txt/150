<A>__{dawn breaks in the sacred glade. shafts of orange morning light. jake and neytiri asleep in each others' arms. maxfield parrish painting. but then the roar of engines. neytiri awakens with a start. the splintering, crackling of forest being crushed under enormous treads gets louder. she watches in growing horror as the blade of a bulldozer becomes a dark wall behind the sheltering ring of willows. she shakes jake, shouting at him in na'vi to wake up.}
