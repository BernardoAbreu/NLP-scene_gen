<A>__{rocked about by the furious powerfields with frightening displays of ray energy.}
<L>__{interior bridge}
<A>__{as all react to the powerful blasts, holding on to railings, etc, at the same time attempting to secure their stations for the evacuation. the damage repair technician leaves his station, crossing to exit.}
<C>__{damage tech.}
<P>__{(leaving bridge; to captain)}
<D>__{severe stress on engine pylons, sir. "ilia"}
<P>__{(to kirk; flat)}
<D>__{v'ger requires the information.}
<A>__{kirk merely looks at her, then to the evacuating crew:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{bridge secure all stations! move out! mccoy jim, what the hell kind of strategy is this ...?}
<A>__{meanwhile, decker has crossed to chekov's now abandoned console, checks it.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{all ship's functions going to automatic, captain.}
<B>__{angle on kirk}
<A>__{turning to confront "ilia":}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{if v'ger destroys the enterprise, the information v'ger requires will also be destroyed.}
<B>__{including viewer}
<A>__{as light show outside perceptically recedes, and simul taneously the rocking ceases. at the same time, "ilia" is saying:}
<D>__{"ilia" it is illogical to withhold required information.}
<A>__{kirk does not reply to this, turns away to observe the withdrawing crew. most are out; only spock, decker and mccoy remain behind with mccoy on his way. the bridge lighting dims , and now kirk looks at spock, who nods approvingly; clearly spock is the only person who seems to comprehend what kirk is doing, and why. as kirk now moves toward the exit, and the lights are dimmed even further:}
<D>__{"ilia"}
<P>__{(almost polite)}
<D>__{kirk unit, why do you not disclose information?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{because v'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet. "ilia" they have repressed the creator.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{the information will not be disclosed.}
<A>__{and, gesturing the others ahead of him, kirk starts toward the bridge elevator. "ilia" calls after him:}
<D>__{"ilia"}
<P>__{(almost a plea)}
<D>__{v'ger needs the information.}
<B>__{at the elevators}
<A>__{decker and mccoy about to enter, spock and kirk just behind all stopping abruptly now at "ilia's" state ment. the very tone of her voice is enough for them to realize they have made a very telling pointerior kirk follows fast:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{then v'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices. "ilia" v'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.}
<A>__{angle on mccoy wryly reacting to this:}
<D>__{mccoy it learns fast, doesn't it...?}
