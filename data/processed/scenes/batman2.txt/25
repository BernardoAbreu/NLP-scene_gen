<L>__{interior prison cell day}
<A>__{tight on a stack of coops and cages, piled high against a bare concrete wall. each cage and there are at least two dozen of them contains a twittering bird: starlings, pigeons, cardinals, titwillows... camera pulls back from the bars of the cages to reveal a very odd figure in prison greys. a canary, perched on his shoulder, sings happily as he stands in front of a grimy, cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, buffing his nails with quick, birdlike strokes. mr. boniface is beak nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is "obscene." despite his eccentric appearance, he comports himself with overblown, theatrical dignity. fastidious and preening, he does not suffer insults lightly. camera pulls back further through another set of bars and we realize that mr. boniface is himself caged. a prison guard arrives to slide back his cell door...}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{up and at 'em, pengy. pengy?}
<A>__{mr. boniface pointedly ignores the guard, refusing to acknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname.}
<C>__{guard }
<D>__{boniface...}
<A>__{mr. boniface finally turns. with an expression of extreme distaste, he affixes a monocle over one eye, returns the canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out.}
