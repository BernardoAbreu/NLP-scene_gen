<A>__{not much to look at. then suddenly... no, just a snapping turtle swimming away. walt descends a little deeper. he loves it beneath the water, there's a tranquility he can find nowhere else. next best thing to meditation. suddenly, he stops kicking.}

<A>__{walt flippers himself closer, wants a closer look. the snake seems unimpressed. then suddenly, the snake lunges at him, misses. shit. walt's look says "what the fuck?" a beat. then the snake swims off. walt relaxes. a beat. but then... he looks around, uneasy. he gets this feeling he's not alone down there. looks about, nothing but murky water. but he's not alone, we can feel he's not alone. he looks left, right... then... four snakes, swimming, hovering, looking back at him. what's with these snakes? walt decides he'll go back to the boat. then... boom. something hits him... and it's no snake.}
