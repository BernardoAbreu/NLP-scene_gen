<D>__{he's in the helicopter.}
<A>__{big is scanning above for the chopper. then upslope he sees the burning fuselage skiing expertly among the trees. the chopper hits a jump and launches into the air it crashes through trees, still soaring and gib looks up, screaming as the chopper drops right toward him he hits the brakes and blammo! it drops onto the road ten feet in front of the skidding van... then slides over the edge and tumbles into a rocky canyon where is blows up! the fireball lights up the night. gib and faisil jump out of the van. they look downslope at the burning wreckage.}

<D>__{harry? harry?!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{gib and faisil spin to look behind them. harry is lodged in tree branches hanging over the road. gib hands his mp 5k machine gun to faisil and reaches up to harry, who grabs his hand and pulls. harry tumbles down into the snowbank. he stands, brushing snow off his tux, and clomps toward the van in his ski boots. he is completely unruffled.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{let's go. we can still make our flight.}
<A>__{as faisil is getting into the van behind harry, two guard teams on snowmobiles roar around the bend behind them, fish tailing on the ice. faisil opens fire. one snowmobile swerves over the embankment. the other pulls up broadside, and the guards duck behind it. gib floors it and the van roars down the mountain. faisil is still ramboing on full auto.}
