<A>__{as mcconnell appears in the cockpit, he sees woody by the forward instrumentation panel, looking at a monitor. the cockpit is also zero g.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{hey, skip.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{take a look.}
<A>__{mcconnell pulls himself forward.}
<B>__{angle on monitor}

<D>__{headed for chryse planitia.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{yup. could get a little hairy just about landing time...}
<A>__{mcconnell pulls back from the screen, looks at woody.}

<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{when does sima do her fly by?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{tomorrow morning, about 0600. that's when we find out whether we came all this way for nothing.}
<A>__{they exchange a glance. woody's right, but the thought is too terrible to dwell on. mcconnell looks back at mars.}
