<A>__{pov: we are running, ragged, full sprint, down a tunnel towards dirty white daylight... no music just heavy breath, kable's heartbeat and the sound of his boots bouncing off the concrete... others are running with us soldiers with weapons... at the tunnel's end: vaguely defined shapes of buildings, smoke, sky... our pov whites out as we...}

<B>__{boom.}
<A>__{all hell breaks loose. suddenly we are in iraq times ten... kable's eyes glance down at his weapon the turrets quickly shift and rotate he whips it up in a flash and returns fire into the mist: thoom! thoom! the shells puncture air and connect distantly... the air ripples all around him, his world closing in... he breaks free and runs toward an open street the turrets readjust he efficiently wastes two blues with automatic fire. slayers battleground #1 open street a couple of pedestrians walk across the street, totally ignoring the violence. kable makes a perfect 90 degree cut and wraps around a street lamp and into the alley. a bum holds out a can with a couple of coins and shakes it. from an aerial pov we see the area swarming with brown & blue combatants and a dozen civilians. in the top right corner of our frame we see the dull reflection of a face, somewhat transparent, watching the battle, tungsten red (similar to your own reflection on a tv). we snap back to the ground the whole area is a battlezone. kable lines up another blue climbing the fire escape to the third floor window and then, coming from the rear surround speakers, behind us: a voice almost a whisper, too clean and distinct to be outdoors in this environment... and too young to possibly belong to kable.}

<P>__{(clean, disconnected)}
<D>__{eat shit please.}
<A>__{thwippp!! the blue drops like a sack. kable perfectly cuts back another 90 degrees and runs for an old store front. inside a clerk "air" bags groceries for an empty store. a brown soldier sets up a tripod machine gun and aims for a bunker a hundred yards north. the distant blue targets seem almost robotically unaware. the brown soldier plants his left hand on the ground for stability, right hand twisting the grip lock and squeezing the trigger: tat tat tat tat tat tat!!!! tatatatatatatatata tat!! the blues fall, some clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to the ground, dead. another team of blues rock their heads around to focus on him. uh oh... booooosh!!!! the brown tripod gunner is vaporized from the knees up... the forearm that supported him is standing straight up, cleanly severed at the elbow. it slowly wobbles over and connects with the two legs severed at the knees. the three limbs fall into each other, forming a flesh and bone tripod. vroooooosh!!! chukunk, chukunk!! a snowplow barrels through the destruction, pushing the bodies and debris out of the way and clearing a path, one streaked with crimson red and burnt flesh. it moves fast and vanishes into the smoke clouds. slayers battleground #1 street down the road, kable saves an east indian woman from getting obliterated by shoving her out of the way of the blazing truck. as kable turns to waste another blue, the east indian woman gets right back up... walking into and getting obliterated by another truck. it's creepy robotic, but violent and too real like a programmed suicide.}
