<A>__{imhotep looks at her and grins, then backhands her wap! evelyn goes down for the count. imhotep stares at her, cold, malevolent, then he turns and walks off into the mausoleums. beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away. treasure chamber day o'connell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and drops to the floor of a dark chamber. he picks up his gunnysack and scans the darkness. something glitters. jonathan and ardeth ray crawl in behind him. o'connell notices a shaft of light, high above him, shooting through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a wall next to one of those mirror disks. o'connell aims his gun. fires. the bullet strikes the disk's pedestal, spinning the mirror into the shaft of light, and wham! the shaft}
<B>__{of light hits the disk and quickly bounces around the room from one disk to another until the whole chamber is lit up.}

<D>__{they are evil, cursed, they matter not.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{well, okay then.}
<A>__{o'connell fires the elephant gun. smoke and flame shoot out. blasts one of the mummies. blows it's upper torso clean off. o'connell pumps the gun, the huge spent cartridge flips through the air. he fires again. blasts the other mummy, blows this one's torso clean off as well. the smoke clears. the two sets of legs keep walking forward, unaffected by the loss of their upper torsos. o'connell can't believe it.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{oh come on, gimme a break here.}
<A>__{and then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move, turning over and crawling towards our heroes, who start to back away.}
