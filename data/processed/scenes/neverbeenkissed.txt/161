<A>__{josie stands by the buffet in her tiara, turns and comes face to face with sam. they're both taken aback by the other's beauty.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{josie you make a really beautiful prom queen.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{thanks. so do you.}
<A>__{they both laugh, embarrassed, at josie's flub.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i always feel like such a goofball in these penguin suits. like i'm at my own wedding or something.}
<A>__{an awkward beat.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you wanna }
<A>__{he gestures towards the dance floor. josie smiles.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{yeah, okay }
<A>__{and they walk off onto the dance floor. angle on: the side of the dance floor. guy approaches aldys.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{hey, listen it's prom. how about we let all the old shit go. would you like to dance?}
<A>__{aldys can't help it. she smiles, a little flattered.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{if it's okay with the rest of the double helix.}
<A>__{aldys smiles and unhooks herself from the group. and starts to dance with guy. angle on: josie and sam as they continue to dance.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{proms always make me sad. they're so final. graduation. everyone's scattering, moving on.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{well, are you here with anybody?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no, i'm alone.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{it's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". and you can't really promenade alone, can you?}
<A>__{sam smiles at this.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you're amazing, josie geller.}
<A>__{angle on: guy and aldys as they dance, we see the cool girls and jason standing to the side of the dance floor laughing gibby reaches into her purse and pulls out a can of alpo. she hands it to jason who pulls a can opener out of his pocket, opens the lid. he hands it to kirsten who take the lid off. she hands the can to kristen, who hands the can to tommy.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{so have you thought anymore about dartmouth?}
<C>__{josie}

<A>__{close up on josie's hand as she subtlety removes her hidden camera pin and drops it to the ground.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{there's something i have to tell you }
<A>__{her foot comes down on top of it.}
