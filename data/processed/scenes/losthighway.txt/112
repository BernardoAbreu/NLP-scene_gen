<A>__{fred, in the custody of guards, wearing handcuffs and leg irons, is being escorted to his cell. he appears zombie like as the guards open the cell door, unlock and remove his shackles, and lock him in.}

<D>__{make yourself to home, fella.}
<A>__{the guards leave. fred stands near the cell door, begins to look around at the four walls, the single cot, the wash basin, and the toilet bowl without a seat. he hears the muffled, distorted noises voices from the surrounding cells. lost voices the voices of death row. fred realizes where he is now. he walks over to the cot and slowly sinks down and sits on the edge. fred perched on the cot in his cell resembles a man adrift on a tiny raft in the middle of an ocean.}
