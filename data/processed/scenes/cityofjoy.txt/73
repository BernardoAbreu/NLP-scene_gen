<L>__{exterior ram's hunt night upstairs}
<A>__{children leaning down as smoke wafts up. we follow the smoke down to max's cigar. aloka and amrita laying the food out. shambu rubbing his father's aching legs as hasari and manooj plant the seeds in hasari's little tea caddy full of earth from home. max is watching this "family" huddled around the father.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{another few months, i will be able to pay off the moneylender in my village and go home and open a grocery shop. all around me sacks overflowing with all kinds of dal and rice, aromatic spices, piles of vegetables... and at night, i will lie on my back beneath the trees sniffing fresh aubergines.}
<A>__{this beautiful picture burrows into hasari's mind. for a moment, he goes there home, to the village...}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{if my wife will let me come within a hundred miles of the place where she herself resides.}
<A>__{ram laughs, hasari smiles...}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{amrita, i saw a beautiful wedding sari today.}
<A>__{amrita is terribly embarrassed.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{it was six hundred rupees only.}
<A>__{he laughs at the impossibility of the price.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{that's only 40 dollars, isn't it?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{if you have it.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i will send it to you from america when i get home tomorrow.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{that's very generous but no, thank you.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{repayment for punching you in the nose.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{you have repaid me by sharing our supper.}
<A>__{joan indicates that max should let it go. hasari ever so carefully waters the tea box.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{doctor big brother, i myself would be willing to accept a gift. could you give me five rupees in a note ten, perhaps. my ankle is badly swelled; the higher the number the more the swelling sinks.}
<A>__{max has to laugh.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i don't have a cent on me. i will owe you.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{how much?}
<A>__{now everyone's attentions is taken by a cry from shambu, who expels his breath, his terrified eyes directing our attention to...}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{it's an amazing sight. two lepers: anouar, bearded with a sharp intelligent, unmarked face, makes his way along on a small wheeled board, at an amazingly fast pace, ahead of said, a huge, mute leper. they stop some feet away. lepers aren't often welcome. out from behind said steps poomina.}
<C>__{poomina}
<D>__{joan di, my sister!}
<A>__{she sees max, gasps, throws herself behind said. joan looks at max he starts to speak, she points a finger that silences him...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{it was poomina who brought you to us. she has herself and her sister to support. it's all right, poomina. anouar, what is it?}
<A>__{she moves to them. they're all three badly out of breath.}
<B>__{with joan and lepers}
<C>__{anouar}
<D>__{it's meeta! it's her time. but something is wrong. the midwives don't know what to do! dr. sunil, could he help, perhaps?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{dr. sunil isn't here.}
<C>__{poomina}
<D>__{meeta will die.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{joan turns to max, who hasn't heard the exchange.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{max, i wouldn't ask, but it's an emergency. a pregnancy gone awry. it's a leper. could you have a look?}
<A>__{max is clearly thrown by the sight of the lepers.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i don't have any experience with leprosy.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{good christ, son, because she's a leper doesn't mean she's not built like a woman!}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i can run and get dr. sunil.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{it's too far.}
<A>__{suddenly, impulsively...}
<C>__{aloka}
<D>__{i could help. i've had three babies.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{you can't do that. they're outcasts, they're unclean.}
<A>__{there are murmurs of assent from the others.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{oh nonsense! it's not contagious!}
<A>__{a beat everyone fixed on max.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{you're a doctor, how can you not help?}
