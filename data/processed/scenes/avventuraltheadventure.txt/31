<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{sandro and claudia arrive in the town of noto and pull up on the opposite side of the street from the trinacria hotel. as they climb out of the car, claudia turns to sandro:}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{are you joking?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{don't think that i want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting anna... it's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. please, sandro, do try to understand me... it would look like i was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...}
<A>__{sandro agrees by a nod of his head and indicates that he understands very well. nevertheless, he doesn't move. several agonizing moments go by in which they both remain silent and still, looking at the hotel across the way. then, tossing away his cigarette, sandro finally walks off and goes into the hotel. left alone, claudia strolls along for a few steps. she sees a letter box up against a building and deposits a postcard she had been carrying with her. she remains there for a moment, watching a parade of ants crawling along the wall, ending up who knows where. they come and go, scurrying up and down in vast numbers, incredibly busy. then claudia turns away and starts pacing back and forth, stopping from time to time behind townspeople who mill about in the streets; she pays them no heed. several young men pass by and turn around to look at her. they are obviously the town's dandies. circling around her, they exchange suggestive comments to one another. even among the women claudia arouses a certain curiosity. but she remains totally unaware of it; such is the intensity with which she concentrates her gaze upon the hotel entrance. suddenly the sound of a shutter being lowered directly behind her causes her to start and turn around. it is a shop being closed. other shops, further down the street, are also closing for the day. the people in the streets begin thinning out and it is not long before claudia is left entirely by herself. in that total solitude, the doorway of the hotel emerges like the mouth of some dark and fearful cavern, so much so that claudia is unable to keep her eyes fixed upon that spot. she turns her head away, but her attention is immediately drawn back again. from the darkness of the hotel's hallway, she spies sandro coming out. claudia doesn't wait to see if he is alone or not, for she has only one thought in mind: not to let herself be seen. but she doesn't know what to do since there is practically no one else in the streets and all the shops are closed. then she notices a tobacco shop still open and she quickly dashes into it. she goes up to the counter as she opens her purse and starts looking for some change.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{some cigarettes, please... do you have any?... nazionali with filters ...}
<A>__{her hands tremble as she searches for the money. finally, she pays the storekeeper and immediately lights up a cigarette. suddenly, she wheels about, having heard sandro enter. he is alone. throwing away his cigarette, he comes up to her, all nervous and excited, and they both step out into the street. as soon as she is outside, claudia leans up against the wall as if she has no strength left. she lets her cigarette fall to the ground and shuts her eyes.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{what is it, claudia?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{oh, sandro... i'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...i tried to hide myself...i feel so small... i hate myself ...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{does it please you to say such things?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{oh no... it doesn't please me at all...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{then why do you say them?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{because what i'm doing is so ugly ... because if you told me right now: "claudia, i love you," i would believe you...}
<A>__{sandro is about to say the phrase, somewhat jokingly in the hope that it might calm her, but also with a certain amount of seriousness. but as soon as he opens his mouth to say "claudia," she places her hand over his lips.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{no... because then i'd force you to swear it, i'd force you to tell me an infinite amount of things... and that wouldn't be right, it couldn't be right... it would be absurd.}
<A>__{sandro tries to calm her with an embrace.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{good. it's better if it were absurd. that would mean nothing much can be done about it.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{but just think the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while i was waiting outside your place...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{so, even if i did say them, i was sincere with her, as i am now with you.}
<A>__{moved by sandro's remark, claudia lifts her head and looks deeply into his eyes. the statement reveals him as being someone quite different from the person she had imagined him to be, and at the same time, it opens up for her a new way of looking at things. shaking his head, and with much tenderness, he says:}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i have never seen a woman like you, who needs to see everything so clearly.}
<A>__{at the sound of a man's voice coming from behind him, sandro turns and sees a gentleman with two large packages under his arms, pointing to a bell cord dangling on the side of a door nearby.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{excuse me, but would you mind pulling that cord for me?}
<A>__{sandro pulls the bell cord and the sound of a bell is heard inside.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{the door opens and the gentleman quickly steps inside. sandro looks up at the building.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{at one time, all these houses were convents.}
<A>__{he takes claudia by the arm and pulls her away towards the square, then looks attentively around the area. bathed in the soft twilight, the buildings and the churches bordering the square reveal themselves in all their beauty. sandro and claudia climb up the steps of a church building and from there gaze at the scene. gradually he allows himself to be overcome with enthusiasm.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{look! what a fantastic scene! what movement, what disorder! they were very much concerned with scenographic effects... an extraordinary sense of liberty...}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence during which he continues to look at the scene before him. then, giving voice to a sincere thought, he exclaims:}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{really, i've got to stop this business with ettore... i would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. you know, i had many ideas...}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{and why did you drop them?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. it took me only a day and a half to finish it, and i got paid six million lire. ever since then i've been doing estimates for other people's designs.}
<A>__{claudia looks at him as if she were about to render judgment, and sandro becomes aware of it.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{why are you looking at me like that?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i don't know about that. and then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?}
<A>__{the last words are spoken with a deep sense of sadness, sandro avoiding claudia's glance. he laughs to himself and for a while remains silent. he takes another look up at the dark outlines of the buildings, then turns to claudia.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{claudia, let's get married?}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(astonished)}
<D>__{what! get married?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{yes. we'll get married. you and i. what do you say?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{what do i say? what can i say? no. at least, not yet. i don't know... i can't even think of it... at a time like this... oh, but why did you have to ask me?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{you look at me as though i had said something foolish...}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{and are you sure you want to marry me? are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{that's why i asked you...}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{so... oh, how i wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. what size shoe do you wear? size 9. that's a very lovely size. but i'm sorry, i wear size 8.}
<A>__{sandro smiles and playfully ruffles claudia's hair. she also smiles, then slowly they both head towards the hotel.}
