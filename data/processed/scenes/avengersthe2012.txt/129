<A>__{thor flies in some stacked containers. he slides across the floor on one knee and one leg out. he wipes a little blood from his nose. the hulk roars and thor looks up, grinning, and raises his hand. mjolnir comes flying through the docking area and thor catches it just as the hulk charges through and hits him on the jaw sending him into a plane. hulk get up and rips the wing off the plane, flinging it at thor, who ducks, causing the wing to hit a jeep. thor throws mjolnir. the hulk catches the hammer but is pulled backwards. he tries to lift the hammer but cannot. thor picks it up and wraps his arms around the hulkâ€™s neck. hulks tries swinging thor off.}
