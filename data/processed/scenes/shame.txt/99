<A>__{a virtually empty car brandon sits a columbian woman across the car, head lent against the window, half asleep, clearly at the end of a long shift. above a poster of a sunny shiny family advertising life insurance brandon's eyes graze over the poster he stands his reflection mirrored back at him, preparing for his stop the train screeches to a sudden halt wheels screeching along the track the columbian woman wakes a young student plugged headphone on, looks up from reading her book. brandon inwardly curses. the train sits in the station. doors not opening. the silence at last punctured by the shrill hum of the intercom }

<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, at this time, due to a police investigation, we have to discharge this train. please follow the conductor to the rear of the train.}
<A>__{the long low ping of the intercom fading out they wait. and wait in silence. brandon leans his head against the glass, closes his eyes, a hangover kicking in. the other few commuters in the carriage sit awkwardly, wondering why the doors aren't opening in the station. details of the carriage appear. half drunken cup of coffee. an old new york post. graffiti on all the car windows. they wait. suddenly passengers from other carriages are making their way through the carriage that brandon's in, with the conductor ushering the passengers to make their way down to the end.}
<C>__{conductor }
<D>__{watch your step between cars.}
<A>__{passengers asking, "what's going on?" brandon finally makes his way down with the other passengers to the last carriage. as he steps out, he looks down to his far left and sees a police caution line being unraveled, and engineers and firemen making their way to the far front of the train.}
