<L>__{interior budd's camper's kitchen day}
<A>__{budd and elle in the tiny kitchen of budd's tiny camper. elle sits a the kitchen table, a black suitcase by her feet. budd stands at a blender making them both breakfast margaritas, as he finishes telling the tale of last night.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{...so that's called a texas funeral?}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{i got to give it to ya budd, that's a pretty fucked up way to die. what's the name on the grave she's buried under?}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{paula schultz.}
<A>__{budd turns on the noisy blender, as elle writes down the name paula schultz on a small notepad, placing it back inside her pocket. as the blender mashes ice, elle looks around and sees the bride's hanzo sword in its sheath, leaning up against the t.v. in the front room. budd shuts the blender off.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{can i look at the sword?}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{that's my money in that black case, isn't it?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{sure is.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{well then, it's your sword now.}
<A>__{the tall blonde girl steps into the living room, takes the hanzo sword, and sits back down on the kitchen chair. she slowly removes the japanese steel from its wood sheath.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{so this, is a hattori hanzo sword.}
<A>__{budd answers as he fills up two former peanut butter jars with breakfast margaritas.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{that's a hanzo sword alright.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{bill tells me you once had one of your own.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{once.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{how does this one compare to that one?}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{if you're gonna compare a hanzo sword, you compare it to every sword ever made wasn't made by hattori hanzo. here, wrap your lips around this.}
<A>__{he hands her her margarita, she takes a sip. he takes a gulp.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{so, which "r" you filled with?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{they say the number one killer of old people is retirement. people got'em a job to do, they tend to live a little longer so they can do it. i've always figured warriors and their enemies share the same relationship. so now you ain't gonna hafta face your enemy on the battlefield no more, which "r" are you filled with, relief or regret?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{a little bit of both.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{bullshit. i'm sure you do feel a little bit of both. but i know damn well you feel one more than you feel the other. the question was which one?}
<A>__{elle looks right at him with her eye, and says;}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{regret.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{yeah you gotta hand it to the ol' girl. i never saw nobody buffalo bill the way she buffaloed bill. bill useta think she was so damn smart. i tried to tell him... bill, she's just smart for a blonde.}
<A>__{he looks over at elle and grins. elle looks at him.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{want your money?}
<A>__{she gestures to the black suitcase by her feet. he smiles and lifts it up on the table, unzipping it open. lying inside is a cool million, the thousand dollar bills are inside stacks of a hundred thousand each. at the sight of all this lettuce, budd lets out a whistle.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{great day in the morning.}
<A>__{he lifts a stack out of the bag, then another, then another...and when he lifts the third stack out, he looks down and sees a black mamba snake coiled underneath. the black mamba opens its wide jaws...and leaps right at}
<B>__{budd...}
<A>__{...striking budd in the face repeatedly in blurred succession (three times in the face, and once in the forearm). budd topples out of the kitchen chair onto the floor, bundles of money fall with him. elle takes a sip of her margarita. the black mamba leaves budd and goes under the refridgerator. elle looks down, budd lies on his back on the kitchen floor at her feet. his face is already grotesquely swollen and white as a sheet. the serpent's extraordinarily potent venom makes a full frontal assault on the cowboys's nervous system.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry budd, that was rude of me wasn't it? budd i'd like to introduce my friend, the black mamba.}
<P>__{(gesturing towards the refridgerator)}
<D>__{black mamba this is budd. you know before i picked up that little fella, i looked him up on the internet.}
<P>__{(she removes her notepad from her pocket)}
<D>__{fascinating creature the black mamba. listen to this,}
<P>__{(reading from the notepad)}
<D>__{"...in africa, the saying goes, in the bush, an elephant can kill you. a leopard can kill you. and a black mamba can kill you. but only with the mamba, and this has been true in africa since the dawn of time, is death sure. hence its handle; death incarnate."}
<P>__{(looking up from the paper)}
<D>__{pretty cool, huh?}
<P>__{(back to paper)}
<D>__{"...its neurotoxic venom is one of nature's most effective poisons, acting on the nervous system causing paralysis. the venom of a black mamba can kill a human in four hours, if say bitten on the ankle or the thumb. however, a bite to the face or torso can bring death from paralysis within twenty minutes.}
<P>__{(up from paper to budd)}
<D>__{now you should listen to this cause this concerns you.}
<P>__{(reading from the paper)}
<D>__{the amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bit can be gargantuan.}
<P>__{(looks up from paper)}
<D>__{ you know i've always liked that word gargantuan, and i so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence.}
<P>__{(back to paper)}
<D>__{"if not treated quickly with anti venom, 10 to 15 milligrams can be fatal to human beings. however, the black mamba can deliver as much as 100 to 400 milligrams of venom from a single bite."}
<A>__{elle finishes reading and puts the paper away. she looks down at budd at her feet, going through all the symptoms she just described.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{now in these last agonizing minutes of life you have left, let me answer the question you asked earlier, more thoroughly. when it comes to that bitch, i gotta lotta "r's" in me. revenge is one. retribution is another. rivalry is definitely one. but i got another "r" for that bitch you might be surprised to find out. respect. but right at this moment, the biggest "r" i feel, is regret. regret that maybe the greatest warrior i have ever met, met her end at the hands of a bushwhackin, scrub, alacky piece of shit like you. the woman deserved better.}
<A>__{budd, dying, watches from the floor as elle takes out her cell phone and presses one button. the other party comes on the line, but we never hear their side.}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{bill...elle. i have some tragic news.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{your brother's dead.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm sorry baby.}
<A>__{budd tries to make a sound from the floor, elle calmly places her foot over his mouth.}
<C>__{elle }
<D>__{she put a black mamba in his camper.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i got her, sweety.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{she's dead.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{let me put it this way. if you ever start feeling sentimental, go to austin, texas. when you get here, walk into a florist and buy a bunch of flowers. then you take those flowers to huntington cemetery on fuller and guadalupe, look for the headstone marked "paula schultz", then lay them on the grave. because you will be standing at the final resting place of beatrix kiddo.}
<B>__{we flash on}
<A>__{the bride's driver's license (the real one), with both her picture and the name, beatrix kiddo. yes, that's her real name.}
<B>__{flash on}
<A>__{classroom of 1st graders on the first day of class. a 1st grade teacher reads roll call;}
<D>__{1st grade teacher melanie harrhouse.}
<A>__{we whip pan across a bunch of kids to an ex cu of 1st grader}
<B>__{melanie harrhouse.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{here. 1st grade teacher beatrix kiddo.}
<A>__{whip pan to an ex cu of the grown up bride,}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{here.}
<B>__{back to elle on phone}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{i'm so sorry baby. look, i can get there in about four hours, should i come over?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no no no no no, you need me baby. i'm there.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{okay, i'm leaving now, go smoke some pot or something. i will be there soon.}
<A>__{she hangs up the cell phone, and looks down at the dead man under her shoe. picking up the hanzo sword, she climbs down on the floor on her hands and knees to pick up the fallen money. cu the black mamba out from under the refrigerator, behind elle... elle senses it. and slowly turns her head to look back.. both black mamba and elle driver lock eyes... zoom into both cu's tighter and tighter, till elle says;}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{bring it on, bitch.}
<A>__{the viper known as death incarnate, leaps at elle. elle flicks her wrist slightly. she doesn't even swing the blade. she just holds it. the snake's head touches it, and is immediately separated from its body. elle's eyes look down at the japanese steel in her hand.}
<B>__{hanzo blade}
<A>__{a smidgen of crimson blood is on the silver steel.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{now that's what i call sharp.}
