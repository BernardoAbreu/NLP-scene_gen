<A>__{the troopers trickle into the kitchen to find... rebecca, kneeling over ridley's corpse, examining the ragged bite on its neck.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{maybe... they're in the house. more of them dogs.}

<C>__{aiken}
<D>__{not a vegetarian, that's for sure.}
<C>__{sullivan}
<D>__{aiken, you'd be better off...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{there was a guy. not part of the team. and there was... some kind of... plant... that seemed... alive.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{gimme a fuckin' break.}
<C>__{aiken}
<D>__{no shit. it disappeared... right into the wall.}
<A>__{rodriguez cringes when she finds a ragged hole in the wall paper near where she's standing.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{i guess it's... time to spill it.}
<A>__{wesker pulls off his dark glasses for the first time.}
<C>__{wesker }
<D>__{i don't know... much more than i already told you. i will tell you the rest now. the labs hare are... were...working on special apps for bio eng1neered materials.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{speak english, hombre.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{marcus has been experimenting with an artificial... man made... virus. coded...the 't' virus. financing came from a private corporation, you may have heard the name... umbrella.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{they're... multi national. huge.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{so huge that they have... connections... in high places. that's why we're here.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{this virus... it jumped, right?}
<C>__{speyer}
<D>__{shit! we're all dead! we got the bug, and we're all dead!}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{it's not airborne. it was spread... in the water supply. lab animals and... the researchers themselves... passed it on... by...}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{by... biting.}
<A>__{wesker hangs his head. it's an affirmation.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{you catch this virus and... what?}
<C>__{wesker}

<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{you stand back up... and chew on the first guy you see.}
<C>__{speyer}
<D>__{christ, this is like... night of the living dead!}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{why, in the name of jesus, would anybody wanna mess with shit... that does that shit?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{victory, friend. civilization has come a long way, but we still have... war. imagine... a soldier who can't die. that... was the concept.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{but the virus... jumped.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{hopefully... if we got all the dogs... we've contained it.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{hopefully? jesus... why didn't you tell us?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{by telling you now, i've put your lives in jeopardy. nobody has this information. except a few high and mightys. me. and now, you.}
<A>__{the troopers fall silent as all this sinks in.}
<C>__{wesker }
<D>__{we have to get marcus out of here. he developed this thing. he's the only one who... understands it.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i don't know, this all sounds pretty shaky to me...}
<A>__{with a lightning move, wesker draws his pistol and...blam! fires... at rebecca. she flinches. the bullet flies past her and shatters the skull of ridley, the dead trooper who, having stood up, was about to attack rebecca from behind. ridley drops... dead again.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{guess that proves it. a head shot knocks 'em down.}
<A>__{rebecca turns and looks at the blood splattered body.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{th that man.. .was dead. (freaking)}
<D>__{i... i'm a doctor! i should know! that man was dead!}
<A>__{vickers reaches in rebecca's bag, pulls out an ammonia capsule, cracks it, and holds it under her nose.}
