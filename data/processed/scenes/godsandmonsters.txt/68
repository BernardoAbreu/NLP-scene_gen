<L>__{exterior whale's house night}
<A>__{whale sits in a director's chair, a martini in one hand, a cigar in the other, a harmless old uncle watching young men swagger and splash in the pool.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i think we're ready to go.}
<A>__{he glances over, sees clay in plaid bathing trunks, sitting apart from the others. he is puffing on a camel.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you're up, mr. boone.}
<A>__{clay ignores him. whale puts down his martini and cigar, picks up a polaroid camera. he moves over to clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{the extras are in their places. now we need the star. wouldn't you like to get in the pool?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you first.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh no. i never swim.}
<A>__{whale removes clay's cigarette, crushes it with his shoe. behind him, the pool is now a pit full of naked shadows.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you'll have to remove that shirt.}
<A>__{whale touches clay's bare chest. clay grabs hold of his wrist, causing the old man to yelp in pain. in the pool, the extras shriek in alarm. clay's hands close tightly around whale's throat.}
