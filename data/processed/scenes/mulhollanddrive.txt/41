<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i...i mean......i...it's none of my business.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{she has pretty red hair... she is very kind i think.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{she sure is. she's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in canada, but i guess you know that. i couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. unless of course i'm discovered and become a movie star. of course, i'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, i guess you'd say, sort of why i came here. i'm sorry, i'm just so excited to be here..i mean i just came here from iowa and now i'm in this dream place. you can imagine how i feel.}

<C>__{rita}
<D>__{it will be okay if i sleep. i need to lie down and sleep.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{all right, but...i'm going to check on you.}
<A>__{rita lies down and is instantly asleep. betty leans over her and listens to her breathing. she gets a blanket and drapes it over the beautiful sleeping rita, then leaves the room.}
