<A>__{drake sits before zoe, who has been shackled to the wall, his right arm encased in one of the armored gauntlets from his burial armor. the rest of the armor has been propped up on a stand nearby.}

<D>__{there is no heaven. no god. no angels. no happy ending for good little girls. the only thing you have to look forward to is nothingness.}

<A>__{he reaches out, running a sharp fingernail over her cheek.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{what if you could keep this little doll like face of yours until the sun itself cooled to a cold, hard rock?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{wouldn't you like that? wouldn't you accept that gift?}
<A>__{zoe reaches out, calmly touches drake's cheek.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{my friends are coming to kill you.}
