<L>__{interior feetz dance floor}
<A>__{sara and patrick, still going at it. snookie, diggy and others prance around them like backup dancers. another angle nikki standing with her crew dourly observing patrick and sara.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{watch me squash their shit. hard.}
<B>__{on nikki}
<A>__{shoving, pushing, and barging her way up to patrick. without preamble or regard for sara, she starts dancing with him. patrick looks at sara but he's somehow dancing with nikki. sara retreats with daggers in her eyes. pissed. patrick (and nikki) unresponsive as she grinds her body into his, raw and wild.}
<B>__{sara}
<A>__{standing where she can see but can't be seen from the dance floor. from a curtain of kids, malakai suddenly appears at her side. sara can't move. she's boxed in. malakai indicates nikki and patrick with slick satisfaction, whispers derisively:}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{you ain't never gonna look as good as she does with him. that's oil. you're milk. ain't no point in tryin' to mix.}
<A>__{he evaporates into the crowd. sara stands there.}
<B>__{patrick and nikki}
<A>__{as a slow dance begins. nikki starts to press herself against patrick. patrick holds her off with both arms. walks away. wider angle dance floor favor patrick moving toward sara. a stark, apologetic expression on his face. he takes her hand. sara fiercely jerks away. patrick grabs her hand again, more emphatically this time. but sara won't budge from the spot where she's standing. so patrick slides his arms around her, holds her without moving. they remain like this for a moment or two until they slowly begin to dance. we push in on them in this little space. patrick's lips brush sara's ear.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{sara...?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<B>__{angle past them on malakai}
<A>__{slow dancing with his flavor of the night. eyes on sara and patrick. both underwhelmed and resentful of what he sees.}
