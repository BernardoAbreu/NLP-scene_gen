<L>__{interior chop shop night}
<A>__{bzzzzz! christine and the beefy jerks watch the brown, '78 volvo, ohio plates: ob gyn, ascend on a hydraulic lift. behind them sits the bmw skeleton. these boys work fast.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{you guys better kill me before you do what you're thinking of doing. cause when i'm mad enough, i can bite down very hard.}
<A>__{the beefy jerks laughs.}
<D>__{beefy jerk #1 sweet polly purebred's got some spunk, huh? beefy jerk #2 i will give her some spunk alright.}
<A>__{they put their blow torches down and turn to her.}
<D>__{beefy jerk #1 we stripped that beemer in fifteen minutes. bet we can strip her in fifteen seconds.}
<A>__{they giggle maniacally and lumber toward christine. their shadows growing larger and larger across her.}
<C>__{christine}
<P>__{(mile a minute)}
<D>__{now wait a minute, guys! two against one ain't fair. lemme go back and get my friend barbara. you'd love her. tits the size of your head. you'll feel like a little baby sucking on 'em. i swear, i will bring her right back. it'll be a four way... you guys like disco? i teach disco dancing at my church. you guys look like you got rhythm in your blood. come on, free lessons if you let me go. beefy jerk #1 i know a dance we can do. the horizontal hustle.}
<A>__{they both laugh. just as they're about to grab her... suddenly, the garage door behind them slides up revealing darkness. christine and the beefy jerks look out anxiously.}
<D>__{beefy jerk #1 who's there?}
<A>__{silence except for crickets. then... from out of the darkness emerges a figure... lex. christine's eyes brighten like a bulb.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i'm here for the girl and the car. you can try to stop me, but i must warn you, it may be hazardous to your health.}
<A>__{the beefy jerks laugh at this little punk. they start toward him, one with a tire iron, the other a big monkey wrench.}
<D>__{beefy jerk #1 too bad. he was such a young idiot. beefy jerk #2 ehhh. he was a stupid boy. he deserved to die.}
<A>__{lex lets out a quick high pitched whistle. the pack of barking dogs led by the shepherd, the pit bull, the doberman, and the basset hound, step from the darkness and flank lex, growling and snarling at the beefy jerks.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{listen to them. children of the night. what music they make... hounds of hell? say hello to dinner!}
<A>__{the beefy jerks drop their tools on their feet and yelp in pain. the pack takes this as a threat and charge the beefy jerks, who bolt for a glass partitioned office. the dogs scratch and bark at the window ferociously. lex smiles at christine. she smiles back. he presses the "down" button on the lift and the volvo descends. lex yells to the beefy jerks through the glass.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{one foot out of that office and your asses are alpo!}
<A>__{lex unlocks christine. she leaps into his arms.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{wow! thank you! you're cooler than the fonz.}
<A>__{she gives him a lingering kiss. lex leans back, gives the double thumbs up, and says...}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{aaaayyyyy!}
<A>__{lex takes her hand and they walk over to the volvo. lex lets her in then rounds the car to the driver's side.}
<D>__{beefy jerk #1 hey, what about the dogs?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{you got a phone in there?}
<A>__{they nod. lex drips a dry smile onto them.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{call the cops.}
<A>__{the beefy jerks watch in disbelief as the volvo screeches out of the chop shop.}
<D>__{2 goddbyes, a punch in the gut and a drumstick}
