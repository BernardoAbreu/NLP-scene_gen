<L>__{interior mine tunnel night}
<A>__{chris leads the group down a tunnel. they come across bits of vintage mining gear. a string of old light bulbs runs along the roof into both tunnels.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{one end of these lights should be connected to a generator. that'll be near the entrance.}
<A>__{they continue down the tunnel. entering...}
<L>__{interior mines tarantula den night}
<A>__{a large cavern. animal carcasses litter the ground. some human remains. dead pets. dead ostriches.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{my birds! you see, sam? i wasn't lying! that's what i can put on the insurance form... giant spiders!}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{ewww... what's that smell?}
<A>__{the others are reacting strongly.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{methane. this cavern is full of gas.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{one spark and we're all dead.}
<A>__{norman swallows his glowing jointerior chris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{that's what i was talking about, chris. presents from the male tarantula to the female.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{so the female's around here?}
<A>__{bret looks around nervously. the group moves closer. they sine their lights on a horrifying sight. joshua's corpse is a deflated flesh balloon. yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull. he's completely desiccated. every ounce of liquid drained away. mike hides his eyes. ashley comforts him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that one just moved!}
<A>__{chris runs over and slices it open with his machete. the web comes away to reveal a human hand.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{there's somebody in here!}
<A>__{chris cuts away more web as the other survivors help. they finally reveal gladys.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{gladys!}
<A>__{the woman's body begins to spasm.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{gladys, please...}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{can anybody help her?!}
<A>__{suddenly ashley pushes her way forward.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{her breathing is shallow. she's going into arrest.}
<A>__{ashley proceeds with cpr. just like she saw on tv. suddenly gladys snaps out of it. gasping for air.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{it's okay. it's okay.}
<A>__{gladys starts to get a grip. trying to focus on chris. from this angle chris look like he has a golden halo.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{am i... dead?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you're okay.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{i'm not in heaven?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{then what's with all the gold?}
<A>__{gladys points behind chris's head to the wall of the cavern. the group turns their lights on it. the reflection is dazzling. veins of gold criss cross the cavern walls.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{gold! gold! look! it's everywhere!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{is it real?}
<A>__{chris checks it out.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{jesus... it's the mother lode... he was right. my dad was right...}
<A>__{chris helps gladys to her feet. they share an emotional look of recognition.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{so were you.}
<A>__{wade chips away at the gold.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{get as much as you can!}
<A>__{bret looks at ashley.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{nice work, doc.}
<A>__{ashley acknowledges him. bret chips gold with wade. sam puts her hand on ashley's shoulder.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you saved my life.}
<A>__{ashley smiles. gladys leans over to norman.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{have you got a smoke, kid?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{the man says this cavern is full of highly flammable methane gas. i smoke to get high, not to die.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{spiders!}
<A>__{the group sees a cluster of normal sized tarantulas scuttling out of the shadows.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what's the big deal?}
<A>__{norman steps on the closest one, grinding it under his boot. he stomps around, crushing as many as he can. mike watches this curiously. taking a look at one of the squashed bodies.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i think you should stop.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{they don't have hair. they aren't fully grown tarantulas.}
<A>__{chris and sam look over.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{they're giant babies!}
<A>__{norman freezes. he hears something moving around in the dark. and then a spine chilling... growl. chris reacts to the noise. he can guess what's coming... the female tarantula steps out of the shadows. consuela has grown to be as big as a volkswagen microbus. by far the largest spider we've seen yet. covered in hair. massive eyes. her two fangs are the size of machetes. mike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{consuela.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{consuela?}
<A>__{the fur on consuela's back seems to undulate. there is something weird there. a lot of weird things. in fact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby tarantulas. as consuela advances, she flicks several dart sized quills off her belly right into norman. a dark stain spreads across the drug dealer's shirt.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{bummer...}
<A>__{consuela pierces norman with her fangs, holding him tight. babies flood of her back and onto the doper, chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{the group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern. a male tarantula drops down to block their escape. sam blows it away. wade and bret are still chipping away bits of gold.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{leave it!}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{so you can keep it all!? hell no!}
<A>__{wade gets a nugget off the wall. he only has a nanosecond to admire it before consuela suddenly looms behind him.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{dad!}
<A>__{bret reaches out toward his father. wade reaches for him. consuela's fangs suddenly protrude from wade's chest and he's hauled backward. the tarantula flings wade into the cave.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{bret, come on!}
<A>__{bret runs after the others. but he sees consuela firing more quills at the group. directly at ashley. bret leaps into harm's way. he's turned into a pin cushion.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{bret!}
<A>__{ashley goes to his side.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{i'm sorry i...}
<A>__{bret dies. sam drags ashley away from him.}
