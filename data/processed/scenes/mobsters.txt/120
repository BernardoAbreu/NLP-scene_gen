<T>__{cut to black:}
<A>__{muffled voices over the sound of wood scrapping on concrete, the screeching of metal on metal, and a hard splash of water.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{charlie's battered face dripping wet. his eyes fluter open. charlie hangs by his wrists from a beam, his toes barely touching the ground. half a dozen men, their faces covered with bandanas, surround him. maranzano stands to one side as charlie stirs from his stupor. looking toward maranzano, charlie shakes his head "no".}
<B>__{maranzano nods}
<A>__{and the men converge on charlie. working him over with belts, clubs, and fists. not a sound escapes from between charlie's clenched teeth.}
<C>__{maranzano}
<D>__{enough!}
<A>__{one of the men lights up a cigarette, slipping it under his bandana to smoke.}
<C>__{maranzano}
<D>__{one word, and all this will end.}
<A>__{charlie stares at maranzano, then croaks his response.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{maranzano shakes his head and nods to the man smoking}
<C>__{maranzano}
<D>__{always the wrong word, charlie.}
<B>__{close on charlie}
<A>__{as the cigarette burns into his chest, his body shaking in pain as two of the men hold him. another man lights up, his face glowing red in the light of the match. then the men back away as maranzano moves in closer to the barely conscious luciano.}
<C>__{maranzano}
<D>__{they will still die, even if you die first. and all for nothing.}
<A>__{charlie tries to form his mouth into words. his breath coming in desperate gasps. maranzano caresses charlie's bloated face.}
<C>__{maranzano}
<D>__{why must you hurt me like this?}
<A>__{charlie jerks his knee up into maranzano's groin maranzano doubles over and falls to the ground, howling. as the men move in on charlie, maranzano staggers back to his feet. he grabs a knife from one of the men and slashes charlie's face. one of the men pulls out a gun, leveling it at charlie's head. maranzano knocks the man away.}
<C>__{maranzano}
<D>__{no! let him live to see what the jews have cost him.}
