<A>__{the house no longer serves any domestic function. it has become the temple and dormitory of nix's small apocalyptic cult. as we go through the house with butterfield we glimpse a little of what life here is like. the rooms are murky, and chaotic. the walls, painted with scenes of cities and landscapes burning, and creatures from some unspeakable nightmare attacking, raping, and devouring helpless humanity. the atmosphere is joyless, and oppressive. the passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his way to the heart of the house. only oil lamps, set on the floor, light these claustrophobic corridors.}
