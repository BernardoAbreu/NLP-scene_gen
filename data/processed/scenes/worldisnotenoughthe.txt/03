<D>__{it's all there.}
<A>__{bond folds the receipt, slips it into his wallet...then, he removes the glasses, slowly, deliberately, eyeing lachaise.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i didn't come for the money. the report you sold him was stolen from an mi 6 agent, who was killed for it.}
<A>__{he takes a photo from his jacket and lays it on the desk.}
<C>__{lachaise}
<D>__{i did not get the report from an mi 6 agent.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{who did you get it from?}
<C>__{lachaise}
<D>__{i am just a middle man. i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss.}
<C>__{lachaise}
<P>__{(controlled fury)}
<D>__{your last chance. take the money.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{your last chance. give me the name.}
<C>__{lachaise}
<D>__{stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?}
<A>__{he nods. an armani thug steps up and takes out a gun...}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{perhaps you failed to take into account my...hidden assets.}
<A>__{bond's mouth edges into a smile. a flicker of doubt on lachaise's face as bond's finger finds a protrusion on the tiny arm of his glasses and... kaboom! the pistol on the table flashes...blinding those around, they cover their eyes, stagger back...it is a brief effect, just enough to disorient the thugs and give bond his opening... he karate chops henchman #1 unconscious, taking his gun. kicks henchmen #2 in the face and throws #3 out the window just as they're getting their bearings. now he nestles the barrel of his borrowed hand gun into the hollow of lachaise's cheek.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{the name?}
<C>__{lachaise}
<D>__{i can't tell you...}
<P>__{(bond cocks the gun)}
<D>__{alright, alright! but you must protect me!}
<A>__{and he freezes. the handle of a throwing knife is sticking out of his neck. bond looks up, catches sight of the cigar girl as she vaults out the broken window and onto the roof. bond rushes to the window...}
