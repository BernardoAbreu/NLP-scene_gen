<A>__{officer sharon pogue is driving the car. it is two years since we saw her at the accident site. her partner, robby lewis, sips coffee and keeps one eye on the cad monitor which lists all area police calls. she slows behind a car that is crawling along, an old 60s car, driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the bench seat. the car's engine is missing and smoking.}
