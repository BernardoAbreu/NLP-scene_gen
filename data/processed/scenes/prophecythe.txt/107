<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the sun cresting the lukachukais and warming with honey colored reflection the interior of the hogan. katherine's head is still on thomas's shoulder, the two of them asleep sitting against the wall. katherine opens her eyes and rises stiffly. she looks out the simple window to the glow of morning without expression, turns, and walks out.}
<B>__{in the other hogan}
<A>__{mary's grandmother and some of the other elderly villagers are attending mary as katherine enters. mary is sitting up in her bed. she smiles at katherine.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{hi, miss henley.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{hi, pumpkin. good morning.}
<A>__{grey horse is kneeling near the bed preparing a bowl drink. into it he crushes charcoal, dodge weed, juniper and ghost plant. this he stirs, heats over flame, and feeds to mary. she grimaces and leans back in the bed as grey horse says a brief prayer.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{katherine runs into thomas outside the hogan.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{how's the head?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{shitty. coffee?}
<A>__{she accepts a mug, blowing a cloud of steam off the top.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{what are we going to do if he comes?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{you mean when, right?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{when he comes.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{there's no phone here? radio?}
<P>__{(she just looks at him)}
<D>__{stupid question.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if we were smart we'd leave. get to a town. a sheriff station.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{mary's ceremony isn't over yet. the enemy ghost way. the alien spirit hasn't been driven out.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{do you really believe in the ceremony?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{would you have believed in any of this three days ago?}
<C>__{daggett}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{so we stay and dump the general's soul.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{you have the gun?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{with one shot left. the spares }
<P>__{(sniffs his shirt)}
<D>__{ and a change of clothing, are all still at the hotel.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{we're going to have to come up with something.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{we could always ask him.}
<A>__{thomas looks up. she's referring to lucifer, who's appeared perched on the edge of the low, eye level hogan roof. the sycophant is also nearby, chattering its teeth and staring at katherine with jealous, rabid eyes. lucifer shivers, a claw turning up the collar of his cloak.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{i always forget how cold it gets in the desert.}
<A>__{the swimming, bottomless eyes fall on thomas.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{mr. daggett, i presume. how's the faith?}
<A>__{thomas can't bring himself to say anything. to form the words.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{come come, must you be so wishy washy about everything? with the absent minded eagle scout, i can see that. but you're looking at the devil man, say something.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{much better. can i have some coffee?}
<A>__{thomas gingerly hands him the cup. the angel lucifer lifts it, and with something unimaginably awful darting out of his mouth, drinks. he offers the mug back to thomas for a sip.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{keep it.}
<A>__{he finishes it. cranes his neck.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{i have come to remind you that the winged party boys are just that: spoiled boys. you are armed, however pathetically, with the one thing they never really understood: theology. it's not much, but that's life.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{is this supposed to be our "win one for the ripper" speech?}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{don't press your luck, mr. daggett.}
<A>__{and you know instantly, in the bottom of your stomach, that those eyes mean it.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{go and get ready, thomas.}
<A>__{thomas hesitates, holds the gaze, then turns and leaves. in an instant lucifer sweeps down from the hogan roof to katherine's side. face and eyes and maggot breath uncomfortably close, he smiles.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{have you ever considered katherine, that the great absentee landlord, the soft eyed eagle scout your childhood prayers are for, is just using you? that you're only the exterminator to get rid of his pests?}
<A>__{lucifer places a cloaked arm around her shoulder and leads her to the walled edge to look out across the endless plateau. his mouth presses against her ear and whispers,}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{god's junkies are coming, katherine. and when they do, all hell is going to break loose...}
