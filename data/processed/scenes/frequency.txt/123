<D>__{this case just got hot. we pull on this string...}
<A>__{but for some strange reason john has stopped listening to satch. something else has got his full attention. it is the nightingale file that lays open on his desk. it is changing...karen reynolds' forensic photo disappears. in fact everything about her, all evidence of her murder police reports, photos, witness reports is gone. john's eyes shoot to the corkboard. the head shot of karen reynolds and the date of her murder are also gone. john looks between the file and the board.}
