<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{what the hell are you talking about?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{it's okay. i know he left me to be with you and i accept that.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{i don't know who you've been talking to, but it's safe to say that you're fucking trippin'.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{it's fine really. it's going to take a while for me to get over it, but i will be okay.}
<A>__{nell starts to get all teary eyed. she picks up a kleenex from a box on the counter and wipes her eyes.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{oh fuckin' lord. this is disgusting.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{pull it together. this is how you run around all the time? have some self respect. no wonder your man left you. who the hell would want to be around this shit all day?}
<A>__{nell pulls herself together.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{jesus teaches us to forgive. and i forgive you for what you did to me when you stole my boyfriend. plus, i feel pretty confident that you'll end up burning in hell because of the various evil ways you live your life and that brings me some satisfaction. but i just want to tell you that ronnie is a good person. he does a lot of stupid stuff, but really, he wants to do good for the world. i want you to know that if you hurt him and ruin his heart, i will personally come down here and kick the ever living shit out of you.}
<A>__{nell walks away.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{you better fuckin' run, bitch!}
<A>__{nell turns around and starts storming toward brandi. brandi throws her hands up, frightened.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{i'm just kidding.}
<A>__{nell stops charging and walks away. nell walks past bruce who is helping a customer at the end of the counter.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{it's not too late to change your ways.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{okay. thanks.}
<A>__{nell walks out of the department store.}
