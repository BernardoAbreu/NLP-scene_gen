<A>__{nearly pitch black. 2 sets of running footfalls. brendan is chasing, running full speed into the blackness, heart pounding we almost don't notice that brendan's are now the only footfalls. brendan notices. he stops. silence in the darkness, except for brendan's breath... and someone near... slam! brendan takes a fist in the cheek and goes down. an inky black figure steps from the shadows and kicks him in the stomach. brendan curls on the ground, the figure over him.}
