<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior treasury jet (dc 9) day}
<A>__{the dc 9 cruises over increasingly mountainous, remote terrain.}
<L>__{interior jet close on travers}
<A>__{who looks tense we move around the cabin and find two more relaxed treasury agents are dozing on the opposite side of the plane, their arms chained to the currency cases. matheson is edgy. another agent offers some condescending reassurance.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{just enjoy the view, huh?}
<P>__{(matheson says nothing)}
<D>__{relax. i mean, what could happen in the air?}
<A>__{matheson turns back to his window and looks down window pov the ground below is covered with snow the jet's shadow moves sleekly and plainly over it. but after a moment we see another jet's shadow on the ground, coming up fast! inside the dc 9 matheson reacts this and shifts his look upward to window pov another plane (gulfstream) is flying a parallel course to the treasury jet, and is just one hundred yards away. close enough to see eric qualen's face in one of the windows.}
<B>__{inside the plane}
<A>__{matheson stands travers has noticed the plane by now too, and gets out of his seat as the other agents react.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(to other agents)}
<D>__{stay put! don't panic, goddammit!}
<A>__{travers moves into}
<B>__{the cockpit}
<A>__{where the pilot seems nervous, but oddly, not frightened.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{he's coming in too slow.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(cool)}
<D>__{no we're going too fast, and we're too high up. push flaps forward twenty degrees and drop to five thousand feet.}
<B>__{the cabin}
<A>__{matheson is out of his seat, pistol drawn. seems a little puny under the circumstances.}
<C>__{matheson}
<P>__{(to agent)}
<D>__{you got any rifles?}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{forward compartment left side }
<A>__{matheson rushes through a curtain to the area between the cabin and the cockpit and pulls open a closet door. to his horror, he finds inside not rifles, but}
<B>__{two dead bodies}
<A>__{who we'll recognize as the missing fbi agents from the photos matheson showed travers.}
<B>__{matheson}
<A>__{backs up in horror and he sees travers calmly coming out of the cockpit. rattled, matheson pulls his gun on travers. travers looks dumbfounded then angry.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing }
<C>__{matheson}
<D>__{checked the plane from top to bottom, huh? you fucker }
<P>__{(clicks hammer back)}
<D>__{put your hands behind your head! it's over!}
<A>__{travers puts his hands out and walks forward slowly, backing matheson into the cabin. not in surrender, but as if he's calming a nutcase. the other agents see this and don't know which way to jump.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{calm down give the gun to me }
<C>__{matheson}
<P>__{(to other agents)}
<D>__{there's a couple of dead bodies in the front compartment they're fbi agents }
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{he's losing it }
<A>__{they now think matheson is crazy too he looks nuts the other agents move behind him. matheson gets even more frantic and point his gun at them.}
<C>__{matheson}
<D>__{goddamn it! don't you see what he's doing! he's hijacking the fucking shipment!}
<P>__{(back to travers)}
<D>__{don't make me shoot you!}
<A>__{the other two agents get behind matheson and rapidly disarm him. travers pulls out his gun with a slow, leisurely move.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{don't make me laugh.}
<A>__{travers fires his gun three times, one for each agent's chest the agents are cut down, realizing too late what's happened. a fourth shot knocks matheson over a seat as if he'd been kicked. travers puts his gun away and puts on a radio headset as he goes to a window.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(to mouthpiece)}
<D>__{move into position.}
