<L>__{interior remodeled house kitchen day}
<A>__{emma makes herself a hangover helper. egg, tabasco, lemon juice, and a shot of vodka. all of it goes into the blender. she fires it up. competing with the noise of hank's saw. then emma notices a bowl of uneaten cat food.}
<L>__{interior remodeled house living room day}
<A>__{emma comes back in and unplugs the noisy saw.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{if you're gonna keep pulling the plug...}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{have you seen zeke this morning?}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{he was chasing something earlier.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{if he got into the wall again, it's your balls in the blender.}
<A>__{they hear faint meowing. hank traces the source. it's coming from behind a partially dismantled wall.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{hey, zeke. breakfast is ready.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i will get the tuna.}
<A>__{emma heads back into the kitchen. hank listens at the wall. after a beat he hears the cat rustling around inside.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{zeke?}
<A>__{emma re enters with a can of tuna. she hears zeke hiss.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{what's wrong with him?}
<A>__{hank shakes his head. the cat noises become more aggressive. the panicked couple tries to follow the cat's progress. they tracks the sounds of battle along the wall. the noises become frantic. scrabbling claws. howls of kitty pain.}
<D>__{hank & emma zeke!? zeke! zeke!}
<A>__{they follow the cat's frenzied movement up the wall, across the ceiling, and down the other wall. hank hurries over. he can feel his cat thrashing maniacally on the other side. a feline scream. and then deafening silence. hank tears open the drywall, reaching for his cat.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{i've got him by the tail.}
<A>__{he withdraws all that remains of the zeker... a bloody tail.}
