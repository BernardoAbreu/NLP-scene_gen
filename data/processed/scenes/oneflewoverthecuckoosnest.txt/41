<L>__{interior tub room night}
<A>__{bromden is pressed against the wall, watching mcmurphy, martini, scanlon and cheswick play a game of monopoly. the others are playing cards or just hanging around, a little chagrined. billy is most disturbed by this separation.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{you need four houses on every lot of the same color, martini. now let's go, for christsakes.}
<C>__{martini}
<D>__{hold it a minute.}
<A>__{there's a flurry of money from martini, red, green and yellow bills blowing in every direction.}
<C>__{cheswick}
<D>__{let's go, for christsakes...}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{it's your dirty roll, cheswick.}
<A>__{cheswick rolls the dice.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{snake eyes! hoooeee, that puts you on my marvin gardens, which means you owe me three hundred and fifty dollars.}
<A>__{cheswick starts counting out the money.}
<C>__{martini}
<D>__{what's thum other things? hold it a minute. what's thum other things all over the board?}
<C>__{cheswick}
<P>__{(to martini)}
<D>__{how can a man concentrate with you sitting there hallucinating a mile a minute...}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{you just come on with that three fifty and martini will take care of himself... your dice, scanlon.}

<D>__{lebenty leben, count me over eleven, martini...}
<A>__{martini picks up a house...}
<C>__{scanlon }
<D>__{not that one, you crazy bastard, that's my house...}
<A>__{scanlon grabs martini's hand and tries to get his piece back. martini won't let go.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{break it up, god dammit! ain't i got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.}

<P>__{(from the next table)}
<D>__{some of us ha ha have b b been here a long t t time, randle, and will b b be here long after this wo wo world series of yours is oh oh oh, what's the use anyway...}
<A>__{mcmurphy slams his fist down on the table, sending the monopoly pieces flying. martini is crestfallen.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{what's the use! hooee! it'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{a baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{it is to me! an' if i hafta bust way outta this place to see it, i will!}
<C>__{cheswick}
<D>__{right!}
<C>__{fredrickson}
<D>__{oh, yeah?}

<D>__{that me an' my buddy, cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery!}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{and how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{that's between me an' myself. so why don't you boys just shove off. i got some planning to do.}
<A>__{mcmurphy sits and resumes his game of solitaire. martini and scanlon are putting the monopoly game back together again. bromden spots (or he thinks he spots) one of the attendants listening at the door. he wants to warn the others, but doesn't know how.}
<C>__{sefelt}
<D>__{maybe he'll just show miss ratched his big thing an' she'll open the door for him.}
<A>__{sefelt and frederickson smile at each other. bromden slides along the wall toward the door.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{maybe i will just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, sefelt.}
<C>__{sefelt }
<D>__{why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, mcmurphy.}
<A>__{fredrickson and sefelt snicker in their hands.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{you think it's funny, huh?}
<C>__{taber}
<D>__{yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!}
<A>__{bromden reaches the door and looks out. no one is there.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{put your money where your mouth is, taber.}
<C>__{taber }
<D>__{yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, mcmurphy!}
<A>__{bromden turns back to the room to see mcmurphy slam his fist down on the table; the monopoly game goes flying.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<P>__{(rising and turning on the others, who back off)}
<D>__{you want me to show ya! you want me to show ya how!}
<C>__{taber }
<D>__{yeah, yeah, show me. show me how!}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{all right!}
<A>__{he looks wildly around the room, spots the machine, crosses to it and smacks it with his hand.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{with this thing! i'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{you mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{you're fuckin' a right, i am!}
<C>__{harding }
<D>__{with your own two hands?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{you heard me the first time!}
<C>__{taber}
<D>__{i will bet a buck you don't do it!}

<D>__{me, too...}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{right!}
<C>__{martini}
<D>__{a nickel.}
<C>__{scanlon}
<D>__{a dime.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{okay. who else?}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{twenty five dollars.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<P>__{(knows he's taking a bad bet)}
<D>__{okay, harding, you're on.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{okay, sucker.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{yeah... okay, stand aside, you guys! you're usin' up my oxygen!}
<A>__{the acutes stand aside and mcmurphy steps up to the machine. he shifts his feet to get a good stance, wipes his hands on his thighs, leans down and gets hold of the levers on each side, and strains. bromden watches, in awe of mcmurphy. mcmurphy turns loose, straightens up and shifts his feet for a better position.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{giving up?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{just warmin' up.}
<A>__{he grabs the levers again. his whole body shakes with the strain. for just a second we hear the cement grind. then his breath explodes and he falls back limp against the wall. there's blood on his hands. no sound but his rasping breath. he opens his eyes and looks around. then pulls out a pocketful of iou's and tries to sort them out, but his hands are frozen into red claws. he throws the whole bundle on the floor and walks out. at the door, he turns back.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{but i tried. goddammit, i sure as hell did that much. didn't i?}
<A>__{mcmurphy exits.}
<B>__{reaction shot of acutes shot of bromden}
<A>__{looking at the machine. a long beat.}
