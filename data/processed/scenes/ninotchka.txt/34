<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{paris street in front of pere mathieu's pere mathieu's is a workman's restaurant set a few steps below the level of the sidewalk. a few typical french workmen are going in for lunch. ninotchka enters the scene, looks around for a second, then goes in too.}
<L>__{interior pere mathieu's}
<A>__{it is a pleasantly simple place crowded with workmen sitting at lunch. an electric piano is playing. pere mathieu, greeting all his guests like a typical restaurateur, sees ninotchka enter.}
<C>__{pere mathieu}
<D>__{this way, madame. are you alone? by the window perhaps?}
<P>__{(he leads the way)}
<D>__{or a nice little corner table?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{this will do.}
<P>__{(she sits down)}
<C>__{pere mathieu}
<D>__{i think this is the first time you have been to my little place. your face is new to me. now, what shall it be?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{raw carrots and beets.}
<C>__{pere mathieu}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{oh, madame! this is a restaurant, not a meadow.}
<A>__{he hands her a slate on which the menu is written.}
<C>__{pere mathieu}
<D>__{here is what we are offering today. please make your choice. i am sure you will find something to tempt your appetite.}
<A>__{suddenly ninotchka stares in the direction of the door. medium shot at the door leon has just entered. the camera follows him as he makes his way casually in ninotchka's direction affecting not to see her. he seats himself at the table directly opposite ninotchka and pretends to be overwhelmed with surprise as he sees her.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{why, hello! it certainly is a small world!}
<B>__{shot including both tables}
<C>__{pere mathieu}
<P>__{(to ninotchka)}
<D>__{well, madame? shall we start with soup? fish soup today. i got up at five to fish them from the seine.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(calling over to pere mathieu)}
<D>__{crayfish soup for me!}
<C>__{pere mathieu}
<P>__{(to leon)}
<D>__{very well, monsieur.}
<P>__{(back to ninotchka)}
<D>__{then, may i suggest an omelet with mushrooms?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{bring me something simple. i never think about food.}
<C>__{pere mathieu}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{but, madame! if you don't think about food what do you think about?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{the future of the common people.}
<C>__{pere mathieu}
<P>__{(sagely)}
<D>__{that also is a question of food, madame. i will bring you a nice little lunch a la pere mathieu.}
<P>__{(he exits)}
<A>__{leon leans toward ninotchka with mock humility.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. you hurt his feelings. it was just like telling a musician you don't like music. that good old man believes in food as you believe in karl marx. you can't go around hurting people, comrade yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. do you know how?}
<P>__{(he changes to the}
<D>__{chair at his table which is closest to}
<P>__{her table)}
<D>__{by eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i don't like your following me.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i didn't follow you.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{then how did you get here?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i always eat here.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{this is a place for workmen.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(laying it on thick)}
<D>__{but my dear child, i am most at home among working men. i hate the places where you circulate the hotel clarence... this is my natural element. after all, what are any of us? workingmen! at least, those of us who are worth our salt. hyah?}
<A>__{he waves off scene to a truckman.}
<B>__{truckman}
<A>__{he is in the middle of an enormous gulp of food. he registers surprise, winks at his companion, and then, deciding to humor a drunk, waves back energetically at leon in greeting.}
