<L>__{exterior house morning}
<A>__{malcolm, his moustache gone, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, hammers in a stake at the base of a collapsed, white tent. a workman holds a pole steadily. pauline sets up chairs around a series of tables. ingrid idles a few feet away. they're in the midst of talking:}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{why was it a secret?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{because i didn't want to get you excited before it was real. it's not really a baby yet. in two more weeks we can celebrate together, okay?}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{why did you tell margot?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{because she's my sister and i trust her. how do you feel about it?}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{i don't want a sister.}
<A>__{pauline touches ingrid's hair gently.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{i'm going to go get wizard.}
<A>__{she runs toward the house. pauline marches toward malcolm.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{margot told claude something i expressly told her in confidence. and he told ingrid.}
<C>__{pauline }
<D>__{i'm stunned that she put me in this position. it's so fucking infuriating.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{well it's that thing where }
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{don't say anything. you know what...just be there for me. silently.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{why do i have to be so careful around her, but everyone is allowed to make fun of me?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i don't know if }
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{malcolm, what did i just say?}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{you know, i just want you to take my side, i don't need you to make it better.}
<A>__{malcolm puts his hand awkwardly on her shoulder.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{ingrid's really upset about it. fuck. i can't believe she did this to me!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i didn't tell you because... i didn't want you to feel like you had to marry me. i found out right before our seminar... i'm pregnant.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{well...does that sound good to you?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i'm still digesting margot telling claude. what a fucking nut job.}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{sorry. i think i'm really happy.}
<A>__{ingrid is watching from across the field.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{come here, honey!}
<A>__{ingrid hurries through the sparkly, dewy grass. pauline hugs her and they spin.}
