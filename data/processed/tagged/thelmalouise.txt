<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior restaurant morning (present day)}
<A>__{louise is a waitress in a coffee shop. she is in her early thirties, but too old to be doing this. she is very pretty and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift. she is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray underneath the counter. it is making a lot of racket, which she is oblivious to. there is country muzak in the b.g., which she hums along with.}
<L>__{interior thelma's kitchen morning}
<A>__{thelma is a housewife. it's morning and she is slamming coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen sink, which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some stuff left from last night's dinner which had to "soak". she is still in her nightgown. the tv is on in the b.g. from the kitchen, we can see an incomplete wallpapering project going on in the dining room, an obvious "do it yourself" attempt by thelma.}
<L>__{interior restaurant morning}
<A>__{louise goes to the pay phone and dials a number.}
<L>__{interior thelma's kitchen morning}
<A>__{phone rings. thelma goes over to answer it.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(hollering)}
<D>__{i got it! hello.}
<L>__{interior restaurant morning}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(at pay phone)}
<D>__{i hope you're packed, little housewife, 'cause we are outta her tonight.}
<L>__{interior thelma's kitchen morning}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{well, wait now. i still have to ask darryl if i can go.}
<C>__{louise }
<D>__{you mean you haven't asked him yet? for christ sake, thelma, is he your husband or your father? it's just two days. for god's sake, thelma. don't be a child. just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud. tell him i'm havin' a nervous breakdown.}
<A>__{thelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them. we see various recipes torn out from women's magazines along the lines of "101 ways to cook pork."}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{he already thinks you're out of your mind, louise, that don't carry much weight with darryl. are you at work?}
<C>__{louise }
<D>__{no, i'm callin' from the playboy mansion.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i will call you right back.}
<A>__{thelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{darryl! honey, you'd better hurry up.}
<A>__{darryl comes trotting down the stairs. polyester was made for this man, and he's dripping in "men's" jewelry. he manages a carpeteria.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{damnit, thelma, don't holler like that! haven't i told you i can't stand it when you holler in the morning.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i'm sorry, doll, i just didn't want you to be late.}
<A>__{darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and it's obvious he likes what he sees. he exudes over confidence for reasons that never become apparent. he likes to think of himself as a real lady killer. he is making imperceptible adjustments to his over moussed hair. thelma watches approvingly.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{hon.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{what.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(she decides not to tell him)}
<D>__{have a good day at work today.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{hon?}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{you want anything special for dinner?}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{no, thelma, i don't give a shit what we have for dinner. i may not even make it home for dinner. you know how fridays are.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a friday night. you'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and i am.}
<A>__{he's finally ready. he walks to the door and gives thelma the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{'bye, honey. i won't wait up.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{see ya.}
<A>__{darryl leaves. we see his corvette parked out front. as he closes the front door, thelma leans against it.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{he's gonna shit.}
<A>__{thelma laughs to herself. she goes back into the kitchen and picks up the phone and dials it.}
<L>__{interior restaurant morning}
<A>__{the pay phone on the wall rings. albert, a busboy in his}
<L>__{50's, answers.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{good morning. why, yes, she is. is this thelma? oh, thelma, when you gonna run away with me?}
<A>__{louise comes over and takes the phone out of his hand.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(to albert)}
<D>__{not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hi. what'd he say?}
<C>__{thelma }
<D>__{what time are you gonna pick me up?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{you're kiddin'! alright! i will be there around two or three.}
<C>__{thelma }
<D>__{what kind of stuff do i bring?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i don't know. warm stuff, i guess. it's the mountains. i guess it gets cold at night. i'm just gonna bring everything.}
<C>__{thelma }
<D>__{okay. i will, too.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{and steal darryl's fishin' stuff.}
<C>__{thelma }
<D>__{i don't know how to fish, louise.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{neither do i, thelma, but darryl does it, how hard can it be? i will see you later. be ready.}
<A>__{they both hang up.}
<L>__{exterior restaurant day}
<A>__{louise pulls out in a green '66 t bird in mint condition.}
<L>__{interior thelma's bedroom closeup suitcase on bed day}
<A>__{going into the suitcase is bathing suits, wool socks, flannel pajamas, jeans, sweaters, t shirts, a couple of dresses, way too much stuff for a two day trip. reveal thelma, standing in front of a closet, trying to decide what else to bring, as if she's forgotten something. the room looks like it was decorated entirely from a sears catalog. it's really frilly.}
<L>__{interior louise's bedroom closeup suitcase on bed day}
<A>__{a perfectly ordered suitcase, everything neatly folded and orderly. three pairs of underwear, one pair of long underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, one nightgown. she could be packing for camp. reveal louise. her room is as orderly as the suitcase. everything matches. it's not quite as frilly as thelma's, but it is of the same ilk. she is debating whether to take an extra pair of socks. she decides not to and closes the suitcase. she goes to the phone, picks it up and dials. we hear:}
<C>__{answering machine }
<D>__{hi. this is jimmy. i'm not here right now, but i will probably be back 'cause... all my stuff's here. leave a message.}
<A>__{louise slams down the phone. a framed picture of louise and jimmy sits on the table next to the phone. she matter of factly slams that face down, too.}
<L>__{interior thelma's bedroom day}
<A>__{thelma is still throwing stuff in, randomly now. she talks to herself quietly the whole time. she is taking stuff off of her nightstand, a small clock, fingernail scissors, etc. she opens the drawer of her nightstand. her attitude is purposeful; she looks as if she knows exactly what she's doing; although, frankly, she has no idea, and each decision is completely arbitrary. as she rifles through it, plucking various items from among the jumbled contents, we see there is a gun in there, one darryl bought her for protection. it is unloaded, but there is a box of bullets. she picks up the gun like it's a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(muttering to herself)}
<D>__{psycho killers...}
<A>__{she grabs the box of bullets and throws them in, too. she tries to close her suitcase, but there is stuff hanging out all over the place. she stuffs things back in the sides and heaves all her weight against the top.}
<L>__{exterior thelma's house day}
<A>__{louise's green '66 t bird convertible pulls into the driveway of thelma's house. the garage door goes up and thelma is standing in the garage with all her gear. a suitcase that looks like it might explode, fishing gear, a cooler, a lantern. thelma's car, a beat up gray honda, is parked in there, too. louise gets out of the driver's seat.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{we don't need the lantern. the place has electricity.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i wanna take it anyway. just in case.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{in case of what?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{in case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(going along with her)}
<D>__{oh yeah, sure, thelma, that lantern will come in real handy. maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{we'd have to. that thing barely makes it down the driveway.}
<A>__{they load everything into the car. the trunk barely closes. thelma heaves all her weight against it. they get into the car and pull out of the driveway. as they drive down the street, we hear thelma let out a long howl. she is laughing and she sticks her arms straight up in the air.}
<L>__{exterior car day}
<A>__{they are driving down the interstate. thelma reaches for her purse and finds the gun.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{louise, will you take care of the gun?}
<A>__{louise shrieks at the sight of it.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{why in hell did you bring that?}
<A>__{thelma wonders if louise is really that naive.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{oh, come on, louise... psycho killers, bears... snakes! i just don't know how to use it. so will you take care of it?}
<A>__{louise reaches over and takes the gun out of thelma's purse and holds it in her hand. she tests the weight of it, and then puts it under the seat. thelma puts the bullets under the seat. they are speeding off down the highway with the radio blaring. louise puts in a tape of wild r&b music.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{whose place is this again?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{it's bob's, the day manager's. he's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i've never had the chance to go out of town without darryl.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{how come he let you go?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{'cause i didn't ask him.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{aw, shit, thelma, he's gonna kill you.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{well, he has never let me go. he never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun. all he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing god only knows what.}
<A>__{they are both silent for a minute.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(looking straight ahead)}
<D>__{i left him a note. i left him stuff to microwave.}
<A>__{after a pause.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i guess you haven't heard anything from jimmy... yet?}
<A>__{louise's jaw tightens. the car speeds up.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{...never mind.}
<A>__{a huge semi tanker carrying gas passes them on the highway and honks. the mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women. there is a bumper sticker on the back that says: "lick you all over ten cents."}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{one of your friends?}
<A>__{thelma is watching herself in the side mirror, pretending to smoke a cigarette. thelma's pov of a sign alongside the road that reads "see you in church on sunday!" thelma pushes in the lighter and waits for it to pop out. louise gives her a sidelong glance, but does not say anything.}
<L>__{interior car country road day}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{how much longer is it gonna be? i'm hungry.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{another hour of so. we've got enough food for a month.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i will never make it... can't we stop just for a few minutes...}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{we've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, thelma.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{then what difference does it make if we stop? come on. i never get to do stuff like this.}
<A>__{louise realizes that thelma is going to revert to a teenager and continue whining unless she gives in.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{alright, but it's gonna be a quick stop.}
<L>__{exterior silver bullet night}
<A>__{they pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with neon. it's called the silver bullet. the sign flashes cocktails beer dancing food. there is a huge gravel parking lot with lots of pickup trucks and older cars. even though it's early, you can tell this place is a real night spot. it's already pretty crowded.}
<L>__{interior silver bullet night}
<A>__{this place is jumpin'. there are ten pool tables with crowds all around. the long bar is filled with customers. there are tables and booths. the room is dense with smoke. there is a dance floor, but no one is dancing yet because the band is still setting up. there are a lot of single men. many heads turn and follow thelma and louise to an empty table.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i haven't seen a place like this since i left texas.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{isn't this fun?}
<A>__{a waitress comes over and drops two menus on the table.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{y'all wanna drink?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i will have wild turkey straight up and a coke back, please.}
<A>__{as the waitress leaves:}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{thelma!}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{tell me somethin'. is this my vacation or isn't it? i mean, god, you're as bad as darryl.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i just haven't seen you like this in a while. i'm used to seeing you more sedate.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{well, i've had it up to my ass with sedate! you said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!}
<A>__{as the waitress returns:}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{alright...}
<P>__{(to waitress)}
<D>__{i changed my mind. i will have a margarita with and a shot of cuervo on the side, please.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{yeah!}
<A>__{as the waitress leaves, a man comes over with a chair which he pulls up to the table and straddles backwards. he is in his late 40's, heavyset, his face is shiny in the neon light.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{now what are a couple of kewpie dolls like you doin' in a place like this?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{mindin' our own business, why don't you try it.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{well, we left town for the weekend 'cause we wanted to try and have a good time. and because louise here is mad because her boyfriend won't call her while he's out on the road...}
<A>__{louise kicks thelma under the table.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(quieter)}
<D>__{we just wanted to get somethin' to eat.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{well, you come to the right place. you like chili? they got good chili.}
<A>__{the waitress returns with louise's drink.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{harlan, are you botherin' these poor girls?}
<C>__{harlan }
<D>__{hell, no. i was just bein' friendly.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(making eye contact with louise)}
<D>__{it's a good thing they're not all as friendly as you.}
<A>__{louise understands.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{your name's harlan? i got an uncle named harlan!}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{you do? is he a funny uncle? 'cause if he is, then he and i got somethin' in common.}
<A>__{harlan laughs. thelma laughs, too, but doesn't really get the joke. louise does not laugh.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(to harlan)}
<D>__{i don't mean to be rude, but i've got something i need to talk to my friend about. in private.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{aw, i understand. i didn't mean to bother ya. it's just hard not to notice two such pretty ladies as yourselves.}
<P>__{(standing, to thelma)}
<D>__{you better dance with me before you leave, or i will never forgive you.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{oh, sure. that'd be fun.}
<A>__{harlan leaves, then:}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{jeez, louise, that wasn't very nice.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{so what if he was? it's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{well, just relax, will ya. you're makin' me nervous.}
<A>__{thelma knocks back her shot of wild turkey and holds up her glass to the waitress to bring her another one. the waitress sees her and nods. she turns back to face her friend.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{so, jimmy still hasn't called yet?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{givin' him a taste of his own medicine. asshole.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i'm sorry, louise. i know you're all upset. it's just i'm so excited to be out of the house, i guess.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i wonder if darryl's home yet.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i wonder if jimmy's gotten back.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?}
<A>__{they both drift off momentarily, contemplating their domestic problems, until the waitress comes over:}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(rolling her eyes)}
<D>__{this one's on harlan.}
<A>__{thelma looks over at the bar where harlan is grinning at her, making dancing motions. she smiles and waves at him. her face becomes serious again as she turns back to louise.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{jimmy'll come in off the road, you won't be there, he'll freak out and call you a hundred thousand times, and sunday night you'll call him back and, by monday. he'll be kissin' the ground you walk on.}
<A>__{thelma's mind goes too fast for her mouth, and the speed at which she speaks can be staggering. louise is used to it. louise smiles wistfully at thelma's assessment of the situation.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{in the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun. so let's have some!}
<A>__{she again drinks her whole shot of wild turkey and holds up her glass, as the band strikes up a lively tune. practically the whole place "whoops" and heads for the dance floor. louise drinks her shot of tequila and holds up her glass, too.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{thelma is dancing with harlan and has been for quite a while. louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named dan. thelma is breathless, drunk and giggly. she holds a beer bottle in one hand. she is laughing a lot about nothing, and harlan is studying her closely. louise notices this.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(over the noise)}
<D>__{thelma, i'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(eyes closed, swaying with the music)}
<D>__{ready when you are.}
<A>__{louise heads off to the bathroom.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(eyes still closed)}
<D>__{louise, i'm gonna come with you.}
<P>__{(she gets a funny look on her face)}
<D>__{i don't feel so good.}
<A>__{she stumbles a step and drops her beer bottle. louise is heading towards the bathroom, where there is a line of at least fifteen women in front of her.}
<C>__{harlan}
<P>__{(catching thelma, copping feels)}
<D>__{oopsy doopsy. we need to get you some fresh air, little lady.}
<A>__{he steers her towards the door. louise leans against the wall, waiting in line.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior silver bullet parking lot night}
<A>__{harlan is hauling thelma out the door into the parking lot. she is pretty limp.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{stop.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i'm spinning.}
<L>__{interior silver bullet night}
<A>__{the waitress is going over to their table. she picks up thelma's purse off the floor and puts it on her chair. she sets the check on the table, looks around to see if she can see them and walks away.}
<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{louise goes into the bathroom. she stands in front of the sink and looks at herself in the mirror.}
<L>__{exterior parking lot night}
<A>__{thelma has been sick. she has harlan's handkerchief and is wiping her mouth. harlan has backed off for this part, but he's right back in there.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{how you feelin' now, darlin'?}
<A>__{harlan is leaning close to thelma's head, and she pulls her head away.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i guess i'm startin' to feel a little better.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.}
<A>__{he pulls her to him and tries to put his arms around her. thelma pulls away.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{i think i need to keep walking.}
<L>__{interior silver bullet night}
<A>__{louise comes out of the bathroom as the next woman goes in. she scans the room looking for thelma. she doesn't see her. she goes over to the table and sees thelma's stuff there. she picks up the check and looks at it.}
<L>__{exterior silver bullet parking lot night}
<A>__{harlan has led thelma off to the far end of the parking lot. he is trying to kiss her now. he is pushing her arms down and turning her head away.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{don't. i'm married. i don't feel good. i've been sick.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{it's okay. i'm married, too.}
<A>__{harlan is pushing himself on her now, and she is beginning to push him away harder.}
<L>__{interior silver bullet night}
<A>__{louise is paying the waitress. the waitress is shaking her head, indicating she hasn't seen thelma either. louise picks up thelma's stuff and heads towards the door.}
<L>__{exterior silver bullet parking lot night}
<A>__{harlan has now pinned thelma against the back of a car and is kissing her neck. he has her ass in his hands. he is beginning to hump her. she is pushing him away as hard as she can, but he is relentless.}
<C>__{harlan}
<P>__{(breathing heavily)}
<D>__{you're beautiful. it's okay. i won't hurt you. it's okay.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{stop it! goddamnit, i mean it! louise is gonna wonder where i am. let go!}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{louise is alright.}
<B>__{louise}
<A>__{is now standing outside the door of the silver bullet. she is looking around.}
<B>__{harlan}
<A>__{is pulling at thelma's clothes. thelma gets one of her arms free and hits him hard in the face. he hits her back and grabs her face, squeezing it hard.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{don't you hit me! don't you fucking hit me!}
<A>__{there is no trace of friendliness in his face now. he looks mean and dangerous. he lets go of her face and pins her arms behind her. he holds both of her arms with one hand.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{you just shut up.}
<A>__{with his free hand, he reaches down and starts to pull her dress up. thelma is still struggling and there are tears running down her face.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{don't hurt me. harlan. please.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{he turns her around, pushing her face down onto the back of the car. he holds both her arms in one hand and continues pulling her dress up over her hips. he starts to undo his pants as we hear the crunch of gravel.}
<C>__{louise }
<D>__{let her go.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{get lost.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{louise!}
<A>__{tight shot of the barrel of thelma's gun being pressed into the nape of harlan's neck. louise's thumb pulls back the hammer.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{you let her go, you fat fucking asshole, or i'm gonna splatter your ugly face all over this nice car.}
<A>__{harlan slowly raises his hands in the air, and thelma darts out, pulling her dress down.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{now, calm down. we were just havin' a little fun.}
<A>__{louise glances at thelma. thelma shakes her head no.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{looks like you've got a real fucked up idea of fun. now turn around.}
<A>__{louise starts to back away, but the gun is still close to his face. his pants are undone in the front. she is still backing away with the gun raised. thelma is inching away as well.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{just for the future, when a woman's crying like that, she's not having any fun!}
<A>__{louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second. then she turns and walks away. thelma does, too.}
<C>__{harlan}
