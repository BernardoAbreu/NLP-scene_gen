<A>__{ellie is on the phone as fisher enters with beer. ike sits at the piano.}
<C>__{fisher}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<A>__{overpriced nice apartment and chinese takeout. that's new york living.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<A>__{... just call me when you have it.}
<P>__{(hangs up, then to fisher)}
<A>__{ike, how is the story coming? is she a man eater?}
<C>__{fisher}
<A>__{or a vegetarian?}
<C>__{ellie}
<A>__{or does she pick "ngb's" "nice guys, but..." nice guys, but i'm cheap. nice guys, but he lives with his mom... nice guys, but he just out of prison.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{no... they're interesting guys. each one of these guys has something going for him. i mean, one's been up everest. another's become a priest. one's a pretty good guitar player. and this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...}
<C>__{fisher}
<A>__{whoa, ike. getting a complex, buddy?}
<C>__{ellie}
<A>__{fisher, let him talk.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(sits)}
<A>__{but one of those guys not one of them knew her at all. each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her. and she never showed up so they couldn't see her. it's a very symbolic thing happening. she becomes what she thinks they wanted to be. fisher doesn't like the sound of this. he glances at ellie, who is looking very interested.}
<C>__{fisher}
<P>__{(in shock)}
<A>__{ike is turning sensitive and i can't bear to watch. i'm going to make a fresh pot of tea. the phone rings as fisher exits. ike goes to the piano as ellie picks up the phone.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<A>__{yeah... oh, jay... okay... bye.}
<P>__{(hangs up, then yells to fisher)}
<A>__{fisher, don't forget the fortune cookies. she joins ike at the piano. ike gets serious.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{is that what i did to you? is that what happened? did i just not see you?}
<C>__{ellie}
<A>__{no. no, you didn't. he hugs her.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(heartfelt)}
<A>__{well i'm sorry, i'm really sorry, ellie.}
<C>__{ellie}
<A>__{i'm sorry, too.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<A>__{wow. that only took us between years to say. ellie blinks back sentimental tears.}
