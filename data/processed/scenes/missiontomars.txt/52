<L>__{interior cockpit. day. minutes later}
<A>__{the crew is gathered around a display screen. the lights are dim, reflecting up off their faces. by their expressions, we can tell the news is not good.}
<B>__{close on the screen}
<A>__{it's a color, high resolution satellite image of the mars one base camp. ghostly, dust covered. no signs of life.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{looks deserted.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{it's still standing, though. so is the erv. and look, there's the greenhouse.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{we know luke survived for at least a few hours. question is, are there any signs of recent activity?}
<A>__{they all scan the screen. phil spots something.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{he grabs a stylus and touches the screen. they all look.}
<B>__{close on the screen}
<A>__{using where the stylus touches the screen as the focal point, the image enlarges. three longish dirt piles appear, some fifty meters from the hab.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{what the hell are those?}
<A>__{mcconnell gets it first.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{graves.}
<A>__{they all realize he's right. they sit back, stunned. but then phil has another thought.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{hold on. there's only three. that means }
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{phil }
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{it means luke must still be }
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{no. it just means there was nobody left to bury him.}
<A>__{this quiets everyone for a long moment.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{check the radiation levels.}
<A>__{phil keys in some commands and data pops up onscreen.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{normal.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{go to the disaster site.}
<A>__{phil uses the stylus to bring more images into view. the frame moves over the terrain in the direction of the face, first in swift blurs, then slowing. scattered rock debris come into view. the image arrives where the mountain was, and they see... debris in every direction, neat spirals of it now, dropped uncannily into place, like some massive earth sculpture. as if but this makes no sense it had been swirled towards a large crater. the crater itself is a perfect circle. they focus on the center of the crater, but the image gets distorted by static.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{i don't know. magnetic interference?}
<A>__{phil tweaks the stylus, but the image won't clear up.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{go to infrared.}
<A>__{phil works the keyboard.}
<B>__{the screen}
<A>__{goes to infrared, reading heat, the middle of the image, where the face is, is still distorted, refusing focus.}
<B>__{the astronauts}
<A>__{sit back, exasperated.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{must be a problem with sima. i don't see how an earthquake, six months ago, could give us this kind of distortion.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{that was no quake.}
<A>__{he leans closer, staring intently.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{then what the hell was it?}
<A>__{mcconnell shakes his head. but his every sense is engaged; he's like a predator just sighting his prey for the first time. we see in his eyes an utter determination to unlock this secret.}
