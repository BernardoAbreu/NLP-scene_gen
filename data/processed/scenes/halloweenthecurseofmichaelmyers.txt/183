<L>__{interior wynn's office night (continuous)}
<A>__{wynn and his staff file inside. removing his hat and duster, he walks over to where loomis is seated shackled to a chair, a bloody slash across his forehead. seeing this, wynn snaps angrily at two burly guards.}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{what is this all about? remove those!}
<A>__{the guards comply. loomis rubs his aching wrists, glowering.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{where's the child?}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{sam, you know you never fail to amaze me. yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. somehow i knew you still had it in you.}
<A>__{loomis sees his .357 resting atop wynn's desk only inches away. wynn's hand covers it, slips it inside the top drawer.}
<C>__{wynn}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{come now, sam. this is a gathering of old friends. i know how difficult this must be for you a man of your upbringing and integrity but now that i'm in charge i felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.}
<P>__{(gestures to his staff)}
<D>__{after all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were. this isn't the way i wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{this is madness, wynn.}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{your madness is another man's greatness. this is the way things have always been. you've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you always did come through our loyal watch dog. finding him. bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work. although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, i had to go after him myself. and what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{it was you.}
<C>__{wynn}
<P>__{(lights a cigarette)}
<D>__{sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{why did you take jamie?}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{she has the gift the blood of thorn running through her veins. michael's mother had it, too. so for six years i incubated her, prepared her for this night. michael has served his purpose. and soon we will have a new progeny.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{jamie's baby ...}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{there you go trying to make sense again.}
<P>__{(grimly entranced)}
<D>__{it's a curse. handed down through countless generations. as ageless as this celebration which you call halloween.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{samhain.}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{and i'm its deliverer.}
<P>__{(slams his key card on the desk)}
<D>__{its calling card, if you will. i follow it. protect it. act as its guardian. in a sense, sam, so do you.}
<A>__{loomis shudders, rocked by these revelations.}
<C>__{wynn}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i know you have more questions, my friend, and there's so much more for you to try to make sense of.}
<A>__{loomis is hoisted out of his chair and led out of the office. wynn and his white coats flow out behind him.}
