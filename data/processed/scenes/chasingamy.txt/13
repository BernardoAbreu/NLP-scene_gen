<D>__{i got the sega in one bag, my clothes in the other, and two months worth of unread comics in this one.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{we're going to a convention, for the love of god. we'll be busy from ten 'till eight each day. when are you possibly going to have time for any of that shit? in fact, fuck it you're leaving some of this shit here in a locker. come on give me the two that aren't clothes.}

<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(leafing through mags)}
<D>__{variety's the spice of life. i like a wide selection. sometimes i'm in the mood for nasty close ups, sometimes i like them arty and air brushed. some times it's a spread brown eye kind of night, sometimes it's girl on girl time. sometimes a steamy letter will do it, sometimes not often, but sometimes i like the idea of a chick with a horse.}
<A>__{a beeping sound is heard. holden checks his beeper.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{go check us in. i've gotta call alyssa.}
<C>__{banky}

<D>__{you're so easy.}
<A>__{they hang up. holden reacts to something oc and exits quickly. c11. banky points to pictures in the book. the kid looks on.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{...and then black beauty couldn't take it any longer, and he finally did some of his own mounting.}
<C>__{kid}
<P>__{(off book)}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{holden grabs banky's arm and drags him away.}

<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{not this trip. but one time, when i was using curb side check in, this sky cap gave me a cock ring and a set of anal ben wa balls. i always thought that was pretty strange. he said his name was frank.}
<P>__{(looks closely at him)}
<D>__{hey! you're name's frank!}
<A>__{banky storms away. the flight attendant watches him go.}
