<L>__{exterior barn morning}
<A>__{grace enters the barn to say goodbye to pilgrim.}
<L>__{interior barn continuous}
<A>__{she moves to his stall and opens the doors. he stands there, without any fear of her. she smiles and enters. she wraps her arm around his neck, pets him and whispers.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i will see you home... ok?}
<L>__{interior creek house day}
<A>__{everything is being packed up. robert is dressed for travel. annie is taping up the boxes containing her computer equipment.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{are you going to stay in the city or go up to connecticut?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{connecticut. i told the office i'd work out of there next week. when are you planning to start back?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{probably first thing in the morning. it's too late to start now. i'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{may i have a suggestion?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{yeah, what?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{take your time.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(innocently)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<A>__{annie looks up from the box to see robert is calmly staring at her. his demeanor is different. something's going on.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you look like something's wrong.}
<A>__{this is robert's moment. he knows it. he takes a breath and hopes it comes out right:}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i will tell you something, annie i stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... and, i swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i don't understa }
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(continues)}
<D>__{and i have two choices. i can either fight the way things are, or accept them.}
<P>__{(annie waits; he smiles)}
<D>__{see, i always knew i loved you more. didn't bother me. i always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... and i guess i thought as long as i did everything right if i was the best husband i could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if i could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... i wasn't asking for more. i told myself i didn't need more.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{but you don't know how you feel about me. you don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...}
<P>__{(bravely)}
<D>__{and i don't want you to come home until you do know...}
<P>__{(the hard part)}
<D>__{... one way or the other.}
<A>__{annie cannot remember a time when she ever loved her husband more than in this moment knowing what it took for him to say this. she would not disrespect it with denials. her throat is choked with tears, she swallows down. she nods. robert nods, feeling both pride and heartbreak in the same moment. he picks up his bag, kisses her goodbye and exits.}
