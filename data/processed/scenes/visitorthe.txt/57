<A>__{no one answers. walter walks down the hallway a bit.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{tarek?}
<A>__{walter walks back into the living room and takes off his coat. he removes some papers from his briefcase and then he notices the drum again. he sits down in the chair next to tarek's drum. he takes the drum between his legs and he hits it a few times. then he starts to play. he stops and then he plays again. this time he is slightly more successful at finding a rhythm. he closes his eyes and bobs his head. he's really getting into it. he opens his eye's open and tarek is standing in front of him. he has headphones around his neck. walter jumps.}

<A>__{tarek sets the chair down and grabs the other drum from beside the piano.}
<C>__{tarek }
<D>__{i was lying on my bed listening to my music and then i was like "what's the crazy rhythm i'm hearing?".}

<C>__{tarek }
<D>__{now take the drum between your legs. like this.}

<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{tarek}
