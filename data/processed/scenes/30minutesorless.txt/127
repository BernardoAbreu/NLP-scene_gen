<A>__{dwayne enters a tanning room. a man in a lab coat stares down at a clipboard, on which a complicated scientific equation is written.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{how's it looking?}
<A>__{the man turns: it's jay. his smiling face is speckled with healing burn wounds.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{it's our most advanced tanning bed yet!}
<A>__{he gestures to a very ordinary looking tanning bed.}
