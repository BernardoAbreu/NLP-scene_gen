<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior gold's gym day}
<A>__{wayne's sitting in the gym. behind him muscle men are working out. their grunting sounds fill the background. wayne looks up and just off camera to the people he's interviewing.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{what do you think of mickey and mallory?}
<A>__{ecu on simon and norman hun, two brothers bodybuilders, in a head shot.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i admire them.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i do, too.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{but how can you say that?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{they're mesmerising.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{hypnotizing.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{have you seen 'pumping iron?'}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{then you've seen the scene where arnold schwartzenegger is talking to lou ferigno.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{through the power of the simple word }
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{and a snake eye glare.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{ and a snake eye glare, arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence ferigno had.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{he squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{he had the edge. the mind's edge.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{mickey and mallory have that edge.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{only on a much grander scale.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{they've hypnotized the nation.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.}
<A>__{the cu of the brothers zooms back.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{you say this and yet...you two are both victims of mickey and mallory.}
<A>__{shot has zoomed back to reveal that both simon and norman are in wheelchairs (their legs maimed or gone).}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{how can you say that you 'admire' them?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's like this, wayne. two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. these two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{why can't they just shake hands and be friends?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{they can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the knoxs. so, you may as well make the first move.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{and they made the first move?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{unfortunately, yes.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{but you see, that's okay, wayne.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{they passed the 'edge' along to us.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{by taking away our legs. now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. probably the whole city. they gave us the fighting spirit. before this happened i was content. now i'm pissed off. now i'm half a man and i've got to work like the devil to get whole again.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{but you'll never be whole again.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{never is a very long time, wayne. a word only the weak use. i'm not a sore loser. even if i don't have a leg to stand on, i'm going to get up and fight this world until i'm on top again.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{that's the mickey and mallory way.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{that's the way of the world.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{they're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{survival of the fittest.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{one last question. usually mickey and mallory kill all of their victims. why did they let you two survive?}
<A>__{the brothers pause, then turn to wayne.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{they had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{just for fun, i guess.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{and then mallory stops mickey and says, 'hey, these are the brothers hun.'}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'oh my god, i'm your biggest fan!'}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{apparently, they've seen all our films.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{they were especially influenced by 'conquering huns of neptune.'}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{so, mallory calls 911 and they took off.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{they actually apologized.}
