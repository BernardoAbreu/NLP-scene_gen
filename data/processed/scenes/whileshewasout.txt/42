<D>__{how come the ladies' bathroom is out of order on a night like this?}
<C>__{cleaning lady}
<D>__{the one at the other side of the mall is open, ma'am.}
<A>__{the cleaning lady disappears through the bathroom door with her cart of cleaning utensils. della looks down the length of the huge mall and decides she's not even going to try to find the other bathroom. she can wait until she gets home. she makes her way towards the exit, pulls her coat in tight and braces herself for the cold front outside.}
