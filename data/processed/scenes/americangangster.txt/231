<L>__{interior airport hanger office minutes later day}
<A>__{richie and toback sit before the federal attorneys and customs agents. the us attorney hangs up a phone ... then:}
<C>__{us attorney}
<D>__{that was a military transport plane. if there was heroin on board then someone in the military would have to be involved. which means that even as it fights a war that's claimed 50,000 americans lives, the military is smuggling narcotics.}
<A>__{richie's in serious trouble and knows it. as does toback.}
<C>__{us attorney}
<D>__{that's how these events are being interpreted by general easton in that call to me. that someone employed by the this office believes the united states army is in the drug trafficking business and is trying to prove it by desecrating the remains of young men who've given their lives in the defence of democracy.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{there are drugs on that plane }
<C>__{us attorney}
<D>__{shut the fuck up.}
<A>__{richie does, but can't conceal the contempt he feels for these men who've never spent a minute on the street but act as if know more than him, and who are, in the unfortunate organization of his world, his superiors.}
<C>__{us attorney}
<D>__{is it any wonder then, because of your actions, the entire federal narcotics program is now in jeopardy of being dismantled as completely and enthusiastic ally as that fucking transport plane? that's what you've accomplished mr. roberts. single handedly.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i had good information the target of my investigation was bringing dope in on that plane.}
<C>__{us attorney}
<D>__{and that target is?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{frank lucas.}
<A>__{no one in the room, except richie and toback, has ever heard the name. the federal men regard one another blankly.}
<C>__{us attorney}
<D>__{who? who's frank lucas?}
<P>__{(no one seems to know)}
<D>__{who's he work for? which family?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{he's not italian. he's black.}
<A>__{now there's a longer, even deeper silence, before }
<C>__{us attorney}
<D>__{is that supposed to be some kind of joke? you're this close to the end of your career in law enforcement, you're making jokes?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i believe frank lucas is above the mafia in the dope business. i believe he buys direct from the source in southeast asia, cuts out all the middlemen, and uses us military planes and personnel to bring pure no. 4 heroin into united states.}
<A>__{richie is looking at faces that are still trying to make sense out of his ridiculous theory. toback tries to come to his defense }
<C>__{toback}
<D>__{richie has a lot of experience }
<C>__{us attorney}
<D>__{does he. and how many arrests has he made in his so called investigation?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i was promised when i took this job, it was about real arrests.}
<C>__{us attorney}
<D>__{does that mean `none?'}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i have cases against most of frank's organization. not him }
<C>__{us attorney}
<P>__{(more to the others)}
<D>__{frank's organization }
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{us attorney}
<D>__{no fucking nigger has accomplished what the american mafia hasn't in a hundred years!}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{yeah, you'd know, sitting here, having never been on the (street) }
<C>__{us attorney}
<D>__{lou, get this fucking kike out of here }
<A>__{richie goes for him and lands several punches before toback and the others can pull him off.}
