<L>__{interior arctic warrior pilot house night}
<A>__{greer, dodge, murphy, and epps stand around by lantern light.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{light in those passages ain't so good.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i'm telling you, i saw somebody. i don't know who it was. but i saw somebody.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{what'd he look like?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{maybe six feet. lanky. i didn't get a good look. he was far away. but i saw him. i saw him as sure as you're standing there.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{where's his boat, then? where's his crew? he ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{she's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{maybe that is his boat.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{gimme a break.}
<A>__{a beat as they sit in silence.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{if somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. she's theirs.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{bullshit. that boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. we found her. she's ours.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{not in the eyes of the law.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{so, we find this guy and make a deal with him.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{we don't exactly have the best bargaining position.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{i say fuck the motherfucker. we're a professional salvage crew going about our business. what's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{and what do you propose? that we knock this guy off?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{why not? why the fuck not?}
<A>__{a beat as murphy, greer and epps exchange looks.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{fifty million dollars. fifty million. we gonna let this guy just take it from us? one guy?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{so we kill him?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{i'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{let's just take it easy here, alright? nobody's gonna kill anybody.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{supposing he wants to get bad with us?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{one guy isn't gonna be so stupid.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{maybe he isn't alone.}
<A>__{they consider this a moment.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{i say we off load some of that gold now.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{would you hold on just a minute here, please? look, there's no reason to panic now. epps saw somebody. fine. it's a big boat. chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. if we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{the gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. like i said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{what if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{we'll stand a watch. four on, eight off. low man first.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{guess that'd be me. again.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{dodge, get on that turbine. i don't care if you don't sleep for a week. the sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. how's the food situation?}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{pretty low all around.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{we'll have to take it easy then. i don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{say we run into this guy again.}
<A>__{a beat as they consider this.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{if he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. if not. we'll have to re consider our options.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.}
