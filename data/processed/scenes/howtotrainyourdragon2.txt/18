<A>__{cloudjumper enters the house through the hole in the roof, sniffing out a baby's cradle in the corner. valka rushes in, panicked.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{one night, a dragon broke into our house, finding you in the cradle.}
<A>__{valka draws a sword quietly, slipping up to the dragon, only to find it huddled protectively over the cradle as baby hiccup innocently plays with one of its talons.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{i rushed to protect you, but what i saw... was proof of everything i believed.}
<A>__{valka's careful approach causes a floorboard to squeak. spooked, cloudjumper whips around to face her, accidentally scratching baby hiccup's chin. their eyes meet. valka lowers her sword, transfixed.}

<D>__{this wasn't a vicious beast, but an intelligent, gentle creature, whose soul reflected my own.}
<A>__{stoick's axe spins through the air between them, barely missing cloudjumper and planting into a pillar.}

<D>__{valka, run!}
<A>__{alarmed, cloudjumper whirls around at stoick and blasts! stoick dives out of the way as the fire splatters against the wall, burning a hole and setting the room ablaze. the dragon moves toward stoick, but valka grabs hold.}

<D>__{don't!}
<A>__{it turns to face her again, locking eyes, agitated.}
