<L>__{exterior beach dusk}
<A>__{a quick glimpse of a pile of dark yuck in the shape of a person, black and skeletal beneath the remains of a silk suit. wound around the corpse are streamers of kelp and other high tide detritus. angle on sykes, fedorchuk, and alterez looking down at the body. a coroner's technician is doing a closer inspection.}

<D>__{found his wallet in his jacket pocket. joshua strader, big as life.}
<C>__{coroner's tech}
<D>__{jesus, what a mess. it's gonna be a bear to make a positive determination, but it looks to me like he was shot before being tossed in the drink. at least twice }
<P>__{(indicates where}
<D>__{hearts would've}
<P>__{been on the body)}
<D>__{ here, and here.}
<A>__{sykes absorbs this. he rises along with fedorchuk and alterez.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{how're you two doing on tuggle's killer?}
<C>__{alterez}
<D>__{the store owner's son is in a street gang, so now we're thinking maybe it's gang related.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{yeah, that's real good. you guys follow up on that for a coupla months.}
<A>__{fedorchuk looks up at jetson standing on the bluff above.}
<C>__{fedorchuk}
<D>__{look at your dildo partner. he's too scared to even come down to the sand.}
<P>__{(calls up to jetson,}
<D>__{even though he's too}
<P>__{far away to hear)}
<D>__{you're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{i'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.}
<A>__{alterez shoots a polaroid of the body. sykes grabs it as it emerges from the camera and walks back toward the car. fedorchuk flips him the bird. as sykes rounds the car, he sees that someone has drawn on the door in yellow liquid chalk marker a big star with "e.t. p.d." printed inside it. sykes looks around. fedorchuk and the others stand together chuckling, conspicuously not looking in his direction.}
