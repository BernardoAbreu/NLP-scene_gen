<A>__{the house and balloon canopy are dwarfed as the group approaches the huge cave opening. dozens of dogs step out of the cave. carl and russell stop. more dogs approach from the side. every way carl turns there are more dogs! growling and snarling, the dogs surround carl and russell. closer... closer... from the darkness a voice:}
