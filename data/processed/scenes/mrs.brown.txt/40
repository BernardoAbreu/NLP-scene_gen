<L>__{interior osborne house, drawing room day}
<A>__{a few days later. a morning "drawing room." standing round the unlit fireplace are doctor jenner, lady ely, lady churchill, the two ladies in waiting and princess alexandra. all are dressed against the icy wind that whistles through the open window where victoria sits knitting busily while bertie stands beside her, coat buttoned up to the collar. ponsonby has stationed himself opposite, beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes. he runs through the daily itinerary.}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{lord clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate princess alice's birthday. dispatches, as usual, at two.}
<P>__{(finishes, then coughs)}
<D>__{the chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in cowes for the weekend. he asks if your majesty might grant him an audience.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{he thought, perhaps, your majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{no. i shall be out walking.}
<A>__{a beat. bertie watches closely now. ponsonby coughs again, nervous.}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{then perhaps your majesty might consider it opportune if the prince of wales were to meet him on your behalf?}
<A>__{victoria stiffens. she speaks without turning.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{on no account.}
<A>__{ponsonby gives up. politely, but firmly, bertie takes up the reins.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{mama, i really do think it's time we made ourselves a little more ... available.}
<A>__{victoria carries on knitting.}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{i think we must accept our position in the country is not entirely unrelated to the continued absence of the monarchy from public life.}
<P>__{(silence)}
<D>__{i thought perhaps we might consider a small gesture of some kind?}
<A>__{victoria looks up sharply.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{gesture?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?}
<C>__{victoria}
<P>__{(cutting in firmly)}
<D>__{no dinners, bertie.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why are you dressed for outdoors?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{it's so infernally cold in here.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{cold is good }
<P>__{(calling across)}
<D>__{is that not so, dr. jenner?!}
<C>__{jenner}
<D>__{i'm sorry, ma'am?}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{cold is good!}
<C>__{jenner}
<D>__{excellent, ma'am, excellent.}
<P>__{(trying his hand)}
<D>__{but perhaps if her majesty were to consider accompanying her new found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...}
<C>__{victoria}
<P>__{(becoming very agitated)}
<D>__{why am i being lectured in this way?!}
<C>__{jenner}
<D>__{forgive me, your majesty. in no way did i wish to suggest }
<C>__{victoria}
<P>__{(cutting across him)}
<D>__{i will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{mother....}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{... least of all my son. it was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.}
<A>__{an appalled silence. with great dignity, bertie absorbs the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation in another direction.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{if it is inconvenient to her majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the prince of wales to host }
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{i do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. doctor jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!}
<A>__{silence. victoria has crossed to the window and stares out at the view. having recovered her composure, she turns to address them all.}
<C>__{victoria }
<D>__{i wish to take the princesses for a swim.}
<A>__{for a moment, nobody believes what they have heard. she continues.}
<C>__{victoria }
<D>__{the turns i have been taking in the grounds have proved most beneficial to me, and brown thinks that salt water will do me good.}
<A>__{bertie stares at her in silence while ponsonby and doctor jenner exchange a worried look.}
