<L>__{interior night. thornfield jane's bedroom the gallery.}
<A>__{jane wakes, hearing a savage, sharp shriek of such power and intensity it seems to tear the night in two. overhead, the sounds of a struggle begin a deadly one. jane hears footsteps rush past her door. she starts to pull on her dress. she hears a man's voice from above:}
<C>__{mason }
<D>__{help! rochester, for god's sake come!}
<A>__{a great stamp on the floor above; something falls with a thud; silence. jane grabs her candle and leaves her room. the guests likewise are all issuing from their rooms; some with candles, some stumbling into the dark. the gallery is filling with terrified ladies and shocked gentlemen. their shadows dance grotesquely on the walls.}
<C>__{lady ingram}
<D>__{oh what is it?}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{who is hurt?}
<C>__{lord ingram}
<D>__{where the devil is rochester?}
<A>__{rochester comes forth from the door at the end of the gallery, holding a candelabra.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i'm here, be composed.}
<A>__{blanche flies towards him like a banshee.}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{what awful event has taken place?}
<A>__{she embraces him. rochester patiently removes her.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{a servant has had a nightmare, that's all. she's an excitable, nervous person and has taken a fit with fright.}
<A>__{jane, the only person behind rochester, sees by the light of her candle that his dressing gown is trailing blood.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{now i must see you back into your rooms because until the house is settled, she can't be properly looked after.}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{is there anything i might do?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{miss ingram, ladies, please return to your nests like the doves that you are. you'll take cold for certain if you stay in this icy gallery any longer.}
<A>__{the candles flicker and fade as the guests make their way back to their rooms. rochester sees jane.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{come this way. make no noise.}
