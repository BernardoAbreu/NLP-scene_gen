<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{they enter. the room is dark, messy, with an old couch and tv vcr. a kitchen is adjacent. the walls are full of goth bric a brac: london batcave poster, one from burton's frankenweenie, a couple of fan zine pictures of siouxsie and the banshees. in one corner is a very expensive stereo, from which the cure plays. in another, a dead plant. the goth girl turns the music down. a table near the door has numbered photos beneath a torn and curling sheet of plastic. small packets of snapshots sit on the table along with a few hand labelled videos and a book of clippings. there's also a guest book.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{you gotta sign the book. doesn't have to be your real name, though.}
<A>__{bitsey signs in.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{first page says you're here to do research on violent crime. the state requires it for nonprofit shit.}
<A>__{zack signs in.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{take a re enactment photo packet.}
<A>__{bitsey does so. as does zack.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{if you guys could share one, it would be really cool. the butt wipes where i do prints kinda jerk my chain.}
<A>__{zack puts his back. bitsey is looking at a photo: the goth girl in her panties and bra laying on the floor with plastic wrap over her head. she's handcuffed and wearing a platinum blonde wig. the pose is half corpse, half pinup.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{that's me. my boyfriend took it. we also did a video. it's fifty bucks 'cause you can see my tits. there's a version without tits, that's thirty five.}
<A>__{zack looks at a video, hand labelled: "constance harraway murder (with breasts)! copyright 1997! svengali productions!"}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{do many people take the tour?}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{not so much anymore. we thought this would be like a busy week gale gettin' the prune juice and all. prune juice is what death row dudes call the poison, 'cause it gives you the shits. most jerks just take a photo from the street. they shot a 'real crimes' episode here, but the owner didn't give us dick.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{you don't mind living here?}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{i'm cool with ghouls. beats livin' with my dickwad parents. it starts over here.}
<A>__{she takes them to the coffee table. among her own things, a dusty johnny walker black label bottle sits beside a tumbler (an index card with the #1 leans against it). the area has been outlined on the table with white shoe polish.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{she let him crash here sometimes. he was like constantly wasted. drank black label religiously.}
<A>__{bitsey and zack exchange a look. the goth girl moves into the kitchen. it's cluttered and dirty except in the various areas which at one point had been outlined and indexed the cards are all dirty. a sliding glass door leads onto the patio. the backyard hasn't been mowed in years; roughly twenty pots with dead plants lying around. by the door, three small taped xs are on the floor, outlined and indexed (#2).}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{this is where the tripod was. my boyfriend borrowed the one we usually show folks. they never found a camera, photos, or videos or anything. gale must have buried them. these serial killer dudes take photos to whack off to later.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{he's not exactly a serial killer.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{whatever.}
<A>__{she moves to the sink. on the linoleum, the position of constance's body has been chalk lined (#3). in this area are a pair of handcuffs (#4). not far off is a roll of packing tape (#5). a pair of latex kitchen gloves are crumpled on the sink counter (#6).}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{she was like totally naked right here. the meter man saw her through the door. gale handcuffed her, taped her mouth, then taped a bag over her head so she couldn't breathe. my boyfriend says that's probably when he fucked her. your muscles tense up when you die the sex is better.}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{he used those housewife gloves so he wouldn't leave prints. they found sticky stuff from the tape on them.}
<A>__{zack picks up the gloves.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{we ask folks not to touch the exhibit.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{he puts them back.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{the totally sick part was where they found the key }
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{we know, you can save that.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{what? where was it?}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{it was in her stomach, dude. he made her swallow it before he bagged her.}
<A>__{a beat. zack's shocked.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{that's pretty much the highlight.}
<A>__{got questions?}
