<L>__{interior molly's condo night}
<T>__{montage over love song:}
<A>__{kirk and molly enter her modern, luxurious condo. kirk takes her coat. they kiss. kirk opens a bottle of wine. he pours one glass to share. they sit on the couch talking. kirk is on! he is confident and silly and molly is eating it up. they are making out passionately on the couch. molly stands and extends her hand to kirk. kirk stands and his boner is impossible to miss. this time he looks down at it as if to say, "how 'bout them apples!?" molly laughs and leads him into the bedroom. kirk sits on the bed and molly goes into the bathroom. he lights a candle. he is now in a normal state of nervousness but nothing like he had been before. he pulls out a stick of gum. he chews it quickly and spits it out. kirk lies down and then sits up and then repeats this. he decides to sit. molly opens the door. she is wearing sexy ligerie and slippers. she looks perfect. she crosses to the bed and sits down next to kirk. they kiss but molly stops.}
