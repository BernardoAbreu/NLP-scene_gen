<A>__{ben gives mumford an exasperated look, but doesn't argue.}
<C>__{mr. cook}
<D>__{is there something we need to know, dr. mumford?}
<A>__{mumford is conflicted, not sure what to share with them.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{well... yes, i guess i should tell you. i don't think i'm going to be able to treat sofie anymore.}
<A>__{mr. cook and ben exchange an alarmed glance. mrs. cook actually cheers up.}
<C>__{mrs. cook}
<D>__{finally, some common sense...}

<D>__{i think you do.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{why don't you tell me?}

<D>__{elizabeth, i'm tellin' you, stop this...}
<C>__{mrs. cook}
<P>__{(dismissive)}

<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{i'd better go.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why can't you see sofie? i know the treatment's working.}
<A>__{mumford looks from ben to mr. cook, who nods his agreement.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{well... you see, the problem is }
<C>__{mrs. cook}
<D>__{ the problem is you're a big fake. you haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.}

<D>__{wow. you're something.}
<C>__{mrs. cook}
<D>__{take a hike, dr. quack!}
<C>__{mr. cook}
<P>__{(ignoring her now)}
<D>__{what is the problem, doctor?}
<A>__{mumford can't take his eyes off mrs. cook, even as he speaks to mr. cook.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{problem? i guess there is no problem... uh, this friend of sofie's, where'd he take her?}
