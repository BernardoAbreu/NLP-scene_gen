<T>__{continuous cut to:}
<A>__{camera tracks into the conference room, giving us andrew's pov as he enters the room where wheeler, kenton, killcoyne, bob seidman are waiting (interior day) ...}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{sit down, andy.}
<A>__{wheeler's secretary, lydia, takes notes.}
<C>__{wheeler }
<D>__{thanks for coming in.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{bob seidman cannot look directly at andrew.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{andy. before we begin, i'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you're in trouble.}
<A>__{(note: joe is seen in his office, or leaning against a window in the conference room whenever he speaks.)}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{i know that, charles.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{more than your friend. family.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{big trouble.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{charles, i must apologize again, for the kronos mishap.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{it was a scary few minutes around here. wow. but thank god, the complaint was found. and no damage was done.}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{this time. what about next time?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{there won't be a next time, i guarantee it.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{andy. it seems that something has come over you, lately: a kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... earth to andy. anybody home?}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{helloooo...}
<C>__{killcoyne}
<D>__{that's right, andy. the last four, five months you've seemed really out of it...}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{at least... different, somehow.}
<C>__{andrew}
<P>__{(keeping it positive)}
<D>__{perhaps... you're right. i've certainly been busy. with the kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the saunders trial all falling at the same time...}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{some people think you have an attitude problem, beckett.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{really? who thinks that, sir?}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{wheeler seems very grave.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{i had no idea there was a concern in that area. hey:}
<P>__{(a smile)}
<D>__{i will get to work on it right away.}
<A>__{no one else smiles.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{we've been talking it over, andy. your future that is... we feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{honesty is always best.}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{do you really think so, andy?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{yes, bob, i do.}
<P>__{(to the group)}
<D>__{excuse me? am i being fired?}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{let's put it this way, andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{in a word, yes.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{we don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited. but we wish you luck, andy, all the luck in the world.}
<A>__{wheeler rises, wearing a friendly smile.}
<C>__{wheeler }
<D>__{and i hate to rush you out of here, but...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{but he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{... we've got a committee meeting.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{excuse me, charles. with all due respect... this is... preposterous! it doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. pardon the lack of humility, but i've had the distinct impression i was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. and i feel that wasn't just my imagination. and i also think i deserve to know what's really going on here, charles.}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{oh, you're right, beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{take it easy, walter.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{if you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the kronos suit?}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{i hoped the challenge would improve your performance. you could say it was a carrot.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{a carrot?!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i buy that.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{as in, the vegetable?}
<C>__{seidman}
<P>__{(suddenly emotional)}
<D>__{andy, you nearly blew the case, for god's sake! that alone is inexcusable. it would have been catastrophic for us. put yourself in our shoes, andy. there's no coming back from an error like that, regardless of who you are!}
<P>__{(softer)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, andy.}
<A>__{andrew freezes the full nature of this situation hitting home. he looks each of the partners in the eye...}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{uh huh... okay... i see...}
<A>__{... at last looking directly at wheeler's secretary lydia, whose pen is poised above her notebook, waiting for someone to say something. wheeler breaks the silence.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{good luck, andy.}
<A>__{wheeler, kenton, killcoyne, seidman and lydia file out. andrew doesn't move. a security guard enters the room.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{i'm here to escort you to your office so you can organize your belongings.}
