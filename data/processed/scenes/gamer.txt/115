<L>__{interior simon's room night}
<A>__{simon is lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling a giant video screen playing back key moments of that day's slayers session in an endless loop. simon holds his fingers up in front of his face, zooming and rewinding the video with little fluid movements of his hands. suddenly the screen glitches out, goes dead for a second and when it comes back the battle images are replaced by a giant face, surrounded by black, staring down at him: humanz brother, early 30's; a savvy leader with an unforgettable presence. his style is a throwback to another era; like a 70s black panther soul brother transplanted into the high tech future.}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{you like the software?}
<C>__{simon}

<D>__{we see and hear everything that goes on inside the so called game.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{alright, then.}
<P>__{(considering)}
<D>__{kable said we got lucky that they were gunning for us what was that all about?}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{kable got a past... he knows things. things he don't even know he know.}
<C>__{simon}

<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{things castle's afraid of. as long as your boy stay on the inside castle know he can keep him quiet but if ever got out...}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{uh uh. castle will never let that happen.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{one battle left, i think i can handle my bidness.}
<A>__{humanz brother just shakes his head.}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{you're not hearing me this is not something you can control. they gonna kill his ass, simon. in the eyes of the world. and then what? you just another poor little rich honky. no kable, no pussy, no shit.}

<C>__{simon}
<D>__{this is, come on... too heavy... i don't know what the hell you're talking about... i just play games, man. games.}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{mm hm. that's right, it's a game.}
<P>__{(changing gears)}
<D>__{you want to win it, don't you?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{yeah, dude, i intend to.}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{then you need to cutcho strings, puppet massa.}
<A>__{humanz brother slowly zooms himself in.}
<C>__{humanz brother }
<D>__{imagine a slayer that don't got to wait to be told what to do. no ping, you dig? a trained killing machine... operating in real time, on pure instinct.}
<A>__{simon can't help but consider it, mind reeling. it's obvious kable would royally fucking dominate, but... simon shakes it off.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{that... would be cheating.}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{a mod, that's all. like that guidance system you hacked on three weeks ago lets you track motherfuckers around corners and shit.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{uhhh...}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{the game got to mutate, after all. it got to evolve, you feel me?}
<C>__{simon}
