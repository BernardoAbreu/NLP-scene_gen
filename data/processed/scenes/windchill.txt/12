<D>__{... believe me, i tried, but i couldn't get a flight. it's my own fault for waiting `til the last minute...}
<L>__{interior exterior oldsmobile dusk}
<A>__{she looks out at the passing landscape as they cruise south on the interstate. the road is wet, though the snow hasn't yet started to stick.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(laughs; on her cell)}
<D>__{what, are you kidding? i'm bored to tears... no, we're still on the highway... how should i know, all highways look exactly alike.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you going to be on that thing the whole }
<A>__{he doesn't finish the thought, just chokes back whatever he was about to say. focuses on the highway ahead.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(on her cell)}
<D>__{uh oh, somebody's upset. i better call you back.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{who do you think? ride board guy. okay, `bye.}
<A>__{she hangs up, aims the camera phone lens his way, and snaps another digital picture of him. she puts the cellphone away, looks up to see him glaring at her.}

<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i've got news for you, i don't get much more entertaining than when i'm on the phone.}
<A>__{he darkens, mutters under his breath:}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{this is turning out great.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{what's that mean?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{forget it.}
<A>__{they ride in silence for a moment. she tries to strike up a conversation, by way of extending an olive branch.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{so you're from wilmington, huh?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{where'd you go to school?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(falters for a second)}
<D>__{um... saint vitus academy.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{st. vitus? you're making that up.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you're acquainted with every school in the area?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{pretty much, yeah.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{including all the catholic ones? because that's where i went. saint vitus academy for catholic boys.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{okay, fine...}
<A>__{they drive for a few moments in silence.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{we had a class together, you know.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{intro to modern philosophy.}
<A>__{he looks at her expectantly, as if she should remember him.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{what? there were about a million people in that class. it was like woodstock. did you ever see so many eastern religion types?}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{so, what's your major?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{eastern religions.}
<A>__{she hoots with laughter. but he's not kidding. he seems surprised by her response.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{you aren't majoring in philosophy?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{no. why?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i don't know. i just assumed...}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{why would you assume anything about me? we just met.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(a little defensive)}
<D>__{i don't know... i guess you just... look like a philosophy major.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{try engineering.}
<A>__{she enjoys the pained look of surprise on his face, lets him twist for a second before explaining:}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{i only took philosophy because i need a humanities credit. i heard it was an easy `a.'}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{hey, that reminds me. what'd you put for the extra credit question on the final?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{which is basically reincarnation, right?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{no, they're not really the same thing. reincarnation is when you come back as something different and eternal recurrence is when you}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{live the same life over and over again.}
<A>__{he looks out at the road, reciting nietzsche from memory:}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{the eternal hourglass of existence is turned over and over, and you with it, a grain of dust.}
<A>__{she looks at him as if he's nuts. a beat, then:}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{he died of syphilis, you know.}
<A>__{he stares grimly at the road ahead, biting back a comment.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{high school and philosophy. pretty much covers everything, don't you think? guess that concludes the entertainment portion of today's flight.}
<A>__{she turns on the radio, finds a station with christmas music.}
