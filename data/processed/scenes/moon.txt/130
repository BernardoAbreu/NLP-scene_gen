<A>__{sam 1 takes his old seat before the model. sam 2 stands over him.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{what about the other clones?}
<A>__{"other clones?" sam 1 just stares back.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{yeah, we might not be the first two to be woken up.}
<P>__{(indicating the model)}
<D>__{you said that thing had already been started when you got here. well, who started it?}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{there might be other clones up here right now. think about it. how did i get here so quickly after your crash? they didn't ship me in from central, there wasn't time. i must have come from the base.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{that's ridiculous. impossible. why would hey do that?}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{i bet there's some kind of secret room }
<C>__{sam 1}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{secret room?}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{yeah, secret room, why not?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<P>__{(losing his cool)}
<D>__{you're the one who's lost the plot! i've been here for three years. i know every inch of this base. i know how many dust fibres are between those wall panels over there why would they do that?!}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{look. it's a company, right? they have investors, shareholders shit like that. what's cheaper? spending time and money training new personnel or just have a couple of spares here to do the job. if they make it through their contract, great. if they don't, hallelujah! no contract completion fees, no retirement package. just thaw out the spare, and keep the profits rolling in. it's the far side of the moon, sam! the tight fuck's haven't even fixed our communications satellite.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{tess would know.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{do you really think they give a shit about us? they're laughing all the way to the bank!}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{tess would know what's going on! she wouldn't let that happen!}
<C>__{sam 2}
<P>__{(exhasperated)}
<D>__{there's some area we don't know about. i'm going to find it.}
<A>__{sam 1 shakes his head dismissively, picks up the wooden house, starts whittling. meanwhile sam 2 has left the room.}
