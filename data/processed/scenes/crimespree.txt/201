<A>__{zammito turns around to see zammito's pov a lincoln town car speeding towards him. through the windshield he can see the smiling face of half tooth tony. the front of the car slams into zammito, lifting him into the air. he flips head over heals then smashes into the windshield and over the car. he lays in the middle of the street, dead. the lincoln speeds off down the street.}
