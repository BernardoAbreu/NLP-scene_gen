<A>__{the room is silent because every booker is reading a different copy of annie's magazine. frank covertly glimpses at the scantily clad models... the twins sharing a magazine, doing the same thing as their father, but keeping an eye out for mom... diane is looking at pictorial exposes on the kind of lives she only hears about on audio tapes... tom sits off to the side, amused by the sight. grace enters as joe enters. they nod across the room to each other with a little smile.}
