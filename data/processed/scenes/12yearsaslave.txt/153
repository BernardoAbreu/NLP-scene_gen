<D>__{...sir...}
<A>__{the sheriff crosses to him.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{your name is platt, is it?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{pointing off to the distance.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{do you know that man?}
<A>__{solomon looks toward the carriage. he has to shield his eyes from the sun. recognition is slow coming to him. but when it does, it hits him as a rush.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{mr. parker...?}
<A>__{solomon starts for parker, but he is pulled back by the sheriff who is keen to determine solomon's true identity.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{say again?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{mr. parker?}
<A>__{as he does, epps makes his way over.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{that man received a letter compiling many accusations. you look me in the eye and on your life answer me truthfully: have you any other name than platt?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{solomon northup is my name.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{sheriff...}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{have you a family?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what's all this?}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{it's official business.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{my nigger, my business.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{your business waits.}
<P>__{(to solomon)}
<D>__{tell me of your family.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i have a wife and two children.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{what were your children's names?}

<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{and your wife's name before her marriage?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{anne hampton. i am who i say.}
<A>__{solomon pushes past the sheriff. as solomon moves toward parker, his pace quickens with each step until hi personal velocity has him nearly at a dead run. the two old friends make contact with each other, wrap each other in a long and emotional embrace. it if finally broken by epps, who has moved over with the sheriff.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{nah... you will unhand 'em. platt is my nigger!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{he is solomon northup.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you say...}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{he belongs to no man.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you say! you come here, unfamiliar to me, and make claims.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{not claims. i have no doubts. this is solomon northup, a resident of saratoga springs, ny.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{to hell with that! my nigger, and i will fight you for 'em!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{as is your right. as it will be my pleasure to bankrupt you in the courts. your decision.}
<A>__{by this time, the slaves in the plantation have overcome their fear of penalty, and left their work and gathered in the yard as witnesses. they stand behind the cabin, out of sight of epps. mistress epps also bears witness, standing on the veranda next to her house slave. her face is of a strange mixed emotion. epps looks to solomon. solomon icily, stoically holds his ground. he makes it quite clear in his countenance that nobody owns him. sheriff, hand on his gun, is there to back solomon up. epps, with no other recourse than to back down:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you think this is the last you'll see of me, boy? it ain't.}
<P>__{(to parker)}
<D>__{whatever paper you hold about his freedom, it don't mean naught. he is my nigger and i will have my day in court, sir. as god as my witness, i will have my day in court. take 'em!}
<A>__{epps calls to bob }
<P>__{epps (contâ€™d)}
<D>__{saddle my horse! and bring her up here.}
<A>__{epps walks back into the plantation. the trio starts for the carriage. solomon is pulled back by the call of patsey's voice:}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{platt...}
<A>__{disregarding parker, solomon crosses over to patsey. under the circumstances, neither really knows how to engage. finally, suddenly, patsey throws her arms around solomon and they embrace. epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter. kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he rides off furiously. calling from the carriage, mindful of epps:}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{solomon...if we know what's wise, we should depart.}
<A>__{a moment longer solomon and patsey hold each other. they separate, solomon heading back to the carriage. he and parker alight. the sheriff chides the horses and they start up. as they move on, patsey sinks down to the ground, where she remains in a weary and half reclining state, the other slaves around her. we stay with solomon as he travels further and further from the slaves who are diminished by distance. solomon waves a hand to them, but the carriage rounds a bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes forever more.}
