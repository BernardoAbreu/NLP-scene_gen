<L>__{exterior baker street day}
<A>__{a hansom cab, with holmes' and watson's luggage strapped to the rack on top, is proceeding down the busy street.}
<C>__{watson's voice}
<D>__{he was the most brilliant man i have ever known and i dare say people have envied me for sharing that flat with him in baker street.}
<A>__{the cab draws up in front of 221b. the front door opens and mrs. hudson, a plump, motherly woman in her fifties, wearing an apron, hurries down the steps. she greets holmes and watson warmly as they alight.}
<C>__{watson's voice}
<D>__{i will grant you he was stimulating but he could also be moody, unpredictable, egocentric, and more often than not, completely infuriating as our landlady, mrs. hudson, can attest bless her kind soul.}
<A>__{the cabbie starts to unload their luggage. as holmes, watson and mrs. hudson proceed inside, camera travels up the facade of the building, past the number 221b, to the bay window on the second floor.}
