<L>__{exterior chinatown, street day}
<A>__{blade emerges from the alley into the sunlight, then hears his name whispered on the wind.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{blade.}
<A>__{blade spins, scanning his surroundings did he really hear his name, or was it just the wind?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{blade.}
<A>__{again, the taunting voice calls him. blade's gaze finally settles on }
<B>__{a man}
<A>__{sitting on a bench in the deep shade, his face obscured by the chinese newspaper he's reading. there's a little girl sitting stiffly beside the man a look of pure terror written on her face.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{afternoon, blade.}
<A>__{the man lowers his newspaper. it's deacon frost. he's wearing sunglasses, but otherwise, he's seemingly unprotected by the sun. blade reaches for his .454 }
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{easy.}
<A>__{frost's hand rests on the back of the girl's neck. we see his claws extend, caressing the flesh beneath her chin.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{wouldn't want our little friend here to wind up on the back of a milk carton, would we?}
<A>__{blade reluctantly lowers his hand. frost smiles. he takes in a deep breath of air, savoring it.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{beautiful day, isn't it?}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{how can you be out here?}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{i dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. we've developed a type of sun blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.}
<A>__{on closer examination we see that frost is wearing a translucent lotion on his face. he touches a finger to his cheek, rubs some of the lotion between his fingers.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{it's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. the goal, of course, is to be like you, "the day walker".}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i don't buy it.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{why not? the future of our race runs through your bloodstream. you've got the best of both worlds, blade. all of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{maybe i don't see it that way.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? spare me the uncle tom routine. you can't keep denying what you are. you're one of us, blade. you always have been.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you're wrong.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{am i? you think the humans will ever accept a half breed like you? they can't. they're afraid of you.}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{the humans fear us because we're superior. they fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.}
<A>__{frost watches the marketers stream past, sneering in contempt.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{look at them, just an endless stream of cattle in a mad race to the slaughterhouse.}
<A>__{frost lifts a silver flask to his mouth, taking a swig of blood. he smacks his lips, sighs contentedly }
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{the pause that refreshes }
<P>__{(offering it to blade)}
<D>__{care for some? smells good, doesn't it? pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{pass.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{you sure now? i bled a newborn for this. you won't find a drink that's sweeter.}
<A>__{it takes every ounce of blade's self control to keep from attacking frost and frost senses this, pressing his sharp thumbnail against the child's jugular.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{tell me honestly, do you really get the same rush from that pasteurized piss serum of yours?}
<P>__{(off blade's look)}
<D>__{you're surprised i know about your serum? you shouldn't be. i know everything about you.}
<A>__{frost leans forward, grinning.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{you can't keep walking the razor's edge, blade. the day will come and soon, when you'll have to choose between our kind and their's. if i were you, i'd take care not to wind up on the wrong end of the fang.}
<A>__{a bead of sweat runs down frost's neck, washing away a minute amount of the sun blocking cream. the patch of exposed skin instantly blackens. frost gazes upwards at the sun.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{love to continue this chat, but it appears i'm melting.}
<A>__{frost rises, taking the little girl by the hand. blade follows, his hand resting on the butt of his casull.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere.}
<C>__{frost}
<P>__{(growling)}
<D>__{watch me.}
<A>__{frost's eyes flicker towards the street a city bus is rumbling by. in a heartbeat, frost hurls the little girl forward out into the path of the oncoming bus! blade has a split second to act. it's frost or the girl and for a moment we actually think he's going to go for frost but then he dives forward, scooping the girl into his arms, throwing themselves out of the bus' path. the bus misses them by a hair. by the time blade looks up again frost is gone. blade rises, cursing, scanning the street as market goers gather around him. whip pan to someone sitting astride a motorcycle, watching blade from the roof of an elevated parking garage. the rider is clad from head to toe in a helmet and black leather mercury.}
