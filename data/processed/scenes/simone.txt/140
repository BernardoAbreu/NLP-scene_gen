<L>__{interior l.a. county jail interrogation room day}
<A>__{viktor sits in an interrogation room in a sea of simone. magazine covers, cosmetics advertisements, publicity shots, interviews, website print outs, photographs and report cards from her fictitious childhood are plastered on the walls, stacks of film cans and tapes of her numerous movie and television appearances.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{ forgive me, mr. taransky. i'm just trying to understand. all these films, tv appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood all fake.}
<P>__{(referring to various items)}
<D>__{this is fake, this is fake fake, fake, fake, all fake.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{that's right. you understand perfectly. i will confess to fraud, not murder.}
<C>__{detective}
<P>__{(referring to oversize mail bags)}
<D>__{a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions also bogus?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{oh, no. the fan club is real. but they were worshipping computer code ones and zeros.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{so, of course, you couldn't kill simone because there never was a simone.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{and this mr. hank aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent simone is an invention himself?}
<A>__{viktor, sensing his sarcasm, does not reply.}
<C>__{detective}
<P>__{(patronizing smile)}
<D>__{but not everyone's imaginary, are they, mr. taransky? i refer, of course, to edith.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{who?}
<A>__{the detective raises a window blind to reveal a next door room where the old woman from the rest home is being interviewed.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{the woman you admitted to a journalist is simone's mother and for whose silence you paid a fortune? is she not flesh to you are her tears not wet?}
<A>__{the old woman glances up and sees all the photos of simone through the window.}
<C>__{old lady}
<D>__{my baby!}
<A>__{the detective abruptly lowers the blind. viktor rolls his eyes at the detective's theatrics. he is suddenly enraged.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{she's insane! this whole thing is insane! there is no simone. look!}
<P>__{(grabbing a simone poster)}
<D>__{even her name is fake. it's not simone.}
<P>__{(he tears simone's name in half to demonstrate)}
<D>__{it's sim... one! simulation one!}
<A>__{the detectives sadly shake their heads.}
<C>__{detective 2}
<P>__{(regarding simone's face also torn in half)}
<D>__{you really hated her, didn't you?}
<A>__{the detective places a tape, marked "exhibit a" in a video machine.}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{perhaps you could explain this to me, mr. taransky or is this tape "doctored" too?}
<A>__{he plays a tape showing }
