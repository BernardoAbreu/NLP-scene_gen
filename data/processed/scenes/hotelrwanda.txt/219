<L>__{interior truck travelling. day}
<A>__{paul now at the front of the truck watches out through a slice in the canvas. sees, the convoy pull out of the mille collines. they travel along the road. turn a corner, and the truck slows ... paul sees: a great mass of hutus fill the road: militia, kids, soldiers discarding uniforms. no longer a mob, but a crush of hutu refugees now fleeing toward them, fleeing the advancing of the rebel army. a crowd of militia men wave their arms, shout at the trucks.}

<D>__{don't stop. push through.}
<A>__{the driver reluctantly speeds up. a break in the mass of hutu refugees. then gun fire ahead. children begin crying, it becomes infectious, spreading to paul's children, some of the women. then ahead, a gang of militia men break from the bushes beside the road. they're running fast toward the truck, some carry rifles. there's more gunfire behind. the militia are almost upon them now. colonel oliver has his pistol drawn.}
<C>__{colonel oliver }
<D>__{keep going.}
<A>__{the militia are at the truck. but they run straight past! as a platoon of tutsi rebel soldiers (in bush camouflage and red and blue headbands) burst from the brush. pursuing, careful, professional.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's the rebels.}
<A>__{the crying stops. silent disbelief.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{we've made it!}
<A>__{cheering breaks out. children frightened again by the sudden euphoria break into cries of joy. a rebel soldier waves his ak 47 in the air.}
