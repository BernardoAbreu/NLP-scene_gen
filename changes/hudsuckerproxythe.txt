The woman's SCREAM on the street below is FAINT, ECHOING, MIXING INTO the sound of an APPROACHING SIREN. THROUGH the window we see the BOARD MEMBERS still sitting around the table, paralyzed in attitudes of horror and disbelief. All stare at the shattered window in the f.g. At the far end of the table, Hudsucker's chair is empty and oddly askew. His cigar still smokes in its ashtray. There are dust footprints down the middle of the long oak table. One Executive sits with a pluming cigarette held halfway to his mouth; another holds a carafe suspended on its way to his water glass; another holds his spectacles inches from his nose. We hear only the HUM of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK. SID MUSSBURGER ENTERS FRAME at the window. He is a tall middle- aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and a commanding presence. He knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his knuckle, looks out, grunts, and draws his head back in. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him INTO the room. The other board members' heads swivel to watch him, all staring, searching desperately for some hint as to the fate of their fallen leader. Apparently, some absurd hope still lingers. Mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair. He reaches over to pluck the smoking cigar from the suicide's ashtray.}

The sign painter makes way as we see Norville's shadow approaching; even from inside the room we can hear that he is WHEEZING HEAVILY. He is apparently carrying the girl, cradled in his arms. He tries to reach down to get the doorknob; can't manage it; turns to press his back against the door and get the knob with his other hand. The door opens as Norville swings around to enter. He is wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode. He swings around to kick the door shut. We see that the lettering on the door is now terribly smudged; we also see, in wet ink, on the seat of Norville's pants: senraB ellivroN tnediserP. Weakly, still cradled in Norville's arms:}
