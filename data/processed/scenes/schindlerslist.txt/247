<L>__{interior brinnlitz factory day}
<A>__{warmed by cognac and friendship, goeth comes through the factory again carrying the suitcase, schindler at his side, steering him to some degree. goeth's hand comes up to his cheek as if to brush away a bothersome fly. but it isn't a fly. one of the workers has spit on him. he turns in disbelief. silence as his hand drops to his side, to the holster he forgets isn't there. he glances around for ss guards... who aren't there. he looks to schindler, thoroughly confused, and whispers }
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{where are the guards?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{the guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. they make my workers nervous.}
<A>__{goeth stares at him bewildered. then again at the worker who spit. then at other workers, the resolve in their eyes. they know he has no power here, and sense he has no power anywhere. his own eyes drift to a woman with yarn in her lap, knitting needles in her hands. is this a dream?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i will discipline him later.}
<A>__{schindler good naturedly throws an arm around goeth's shoulder and leads him away. the workers watch as the two germans disappear out the factory doors.}
