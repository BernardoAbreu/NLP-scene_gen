<A>__{harriet rushes out and smiles as she sees the source of the noise. charlie serenades harriet in the street below, accompanied by a trumpeter with a mute, a double bass player}
<B>__{and a guy on a snare.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{harriet, harriet hard hearted harbinger of haggis beautiful, bemused bellicose butcher untrust ing unknow ing unlov ing he wants you back he screams into the night air like a fireman going to a window that has no fire except the passion of his heart i am lonely, it's really hard this poem sucks}
<A>__{a crowd has gathered in the street and spectators group on their balconies. they break out into applause. charlie proudly takes the applause and bows to harriet. she throws him a flower. he's won her back.}
