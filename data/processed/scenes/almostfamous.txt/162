<A>__{leslie in the bathroom. penny enters and watches her discreetly. they stand together, side by side at the mirror. leslie looks once, turns and then turns back at penny. she knows.}
<L>__{interior backroom night}
<A>__{william sits with the band. over jeff's head, penny hangs nearby, at the outskirts, drinking and dancing. they share a look, feigning casualty.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{you guys you guys }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're gonna be on the cover of rolling stone.}
<A>__{stunned and overwhelmed, the band waits a beat, lets it sink in... and goes wild. russell, stunned too, looks at the kid. it's big news. jeff stands immediately, eyes moist, glass raised.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(tears welling, instantly)}

<A>__{together. together! they begin singing the then current dr. hook and the medicine show hit, "the cover of the rolling stone" to william.}
<C>__{leslie}
<D>__{who is that girl? she's creeping me out. she's not with any of you, is she? william dick she's with me.}
<A>__{and now leslie has confirmation. a symphony of looks, as dick gets to his feet and moves to confront penny. penny lane's eyes fill and she runs out. russell stands... and sees william also stand. william turns and follows her. russell stands watching, and does not leave. we hear elton john's "mona lisas and mad hatters."}
