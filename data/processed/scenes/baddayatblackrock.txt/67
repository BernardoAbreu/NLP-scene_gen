<A>__{as he stares at hector walking toward the jeep.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(controlling his jangled nerves)}
<D>__{hector!}
<A>__{hector stops, turns to face pete. he hesitates, then...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{hmmmm?}
<A>__{then, with a final glance at the jeep, hector lumbers to pete, who disappears inside the hallway.}
<L>__{interior rear hallway}
<A>__{as hector enters and stops. pete quickly closes the door behind him and walks toward the lobby, attempting to draw hector toward the black alcove center screen b.g. but hector is not to be sucked in. he glares at pete, waiting. (note: the following dialogue is delivered sotto voce.)}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{what you want?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{he's still in his room. macreedy, i mean.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{so...? you want me to tuck him in?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i thought maybe you wanted to tell smith.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(explaining something}
<D>__{he feels pete already}
<P>__{knows)}
<D>__{smith said he'd be here at midnight. he don't want to be disturbed.}
<A>__{he jams a cigarette in his mouth. pete watches him frantically as he searches his pockets for a match. he can't find one.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you got a match?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{come on. i got some in the lobby.}
<A>__{he starts to turn. hector's pig eyes are slits of suspicion. before pete can move, hector reaches out, hooking two heavy fingers inside a pocket of pete's shirt. slowly hector's expression changes to one of insidious cunning. his fingers come out of pete's pocket, and between them is a paper book of matches.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i thought you didn't have a match.}
<A>__{pete is unable to answer. he is scared to death.}
