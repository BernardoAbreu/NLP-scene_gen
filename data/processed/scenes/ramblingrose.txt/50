<A>__{other and daddy on the patio. daddy stands up.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{hope for the best? i don't understand all this skepticism. i thought you liked rose.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{i love rosebud, i am wild about rosebud. i just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. we have growing children in the house.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{hotcha character. if i had to live with your cynicism, i wouldn't want to live at all. what you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(gently, his irony is mild)}
<D>__{all right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i'm not in the fourth dimension }
<P>__{(points a finger at him)}
<D>__{ you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. as blake said, if god had doubt the sun would go out.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(again gentle irony,}
<D>__{always courtly toward}
<P>__{her)}
<D>__{forgive my crudity, darlin'. i don't understand these deeper things the way you do.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(reaches up, takes his hand)}
<D>__{be nice to rose. she's never had a real home.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{you're a wonderful woman, darlin'. as long as you're around, i'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.}
