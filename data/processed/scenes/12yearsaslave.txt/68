<L>__{exterior creek day}
<A>__{ end of june, 1841 we have a series of scenes in which we see solomon and a team of blacks working on the creek: chopping trees along the banks, widening out the shore... it's all just a trial for now. the work is diligent, but it is basic to this pointerior still, under solomon's direction, the slaves go at it like they've got something to prove. and rightly they do. solomon also works on a narrow raft of twelve cribs with which he will transport the timber. once this is constructed, he personally "sails" them up}
