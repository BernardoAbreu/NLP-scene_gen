<L>__{interior cave home day}
<A>__{ichabod and young masbath step in. walls are hung with skins and skeletons, dry flowers and reed grass in patterns. an old crone sits facing away. the old crone, a mountain woman with matted hair and grey features, sits disinterested. ichabod edges closer.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{pardon. you did not answer when i knocked. are we intruding?}
<C>__{old crone}
<D>__{you are from the hollow?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{in a way, yes.}
<A>__{ichabod looks at tables of gourd bowls of dead insects and acorns. knifes, scissors, yellow bones. he takes the lenape's piece of reed grass from his pocket.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{the lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him? the redman?}
<P>__{(uncomfortable wait)}
<D>__{i should tell you... he has been murdered.}
<C>__{old crone}
<D>__{leave me. you are not welcome here.}
<A>__{the old crone places something on a table beside her a dead cardinal, bright red. ichabod is afraid, backing away, but young masbath takes the woven piece and steps to the crone.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{were you a friend to the indian?}
<P>__{(waits)}
<D>__{you should have this... if you were his friend.}
<A>__{young masbath puts the woven piece beside the cardinal. he walks to join ichabod in leaving.}
<C>__{old crone}
<D>__{you seek remedy against the horseman?}
<A>__{the old crone reaches to pick up the weaving. she stands, faces them. tall. ichabod nods.}
<C>__{old crone}
<P>__{(to young masbath)}
<D>__{go out and keep away, child.}
<P>__{(to ichabod)}
<D>__{you stay. follow with me.}
<A>__{the old crone takes a candle and walks, deep into the cave.}
