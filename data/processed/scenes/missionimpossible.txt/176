<A>__{this barely furnished flat is as nondescript as the row of buildings it's in. ethan hurriedly digs through an overnight bag until he finds what he's looking for the now battered bible he's used to contact max. he flips through the pages and crosses the room to his laptop, which is powered up and waiting on the tiny desk. luther, alone in a chair across the room. is seriously preoccupied. krieger is sprawled on a ratty sofa, hoisting a lager and watching cnn. claire is at the window staring out, anxious. krieger glances over the back of the sofa at ethan.}
<C>__{krieger}
<D>__{you contacting your buyer?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{ethan?}
<A>__{from the desk, ethan glances up. then goes back to the computer. krieger continues to glare over the sofa back.}
<C>__{krieger }
<D>__{ethan? oh, 'scuse me mr. hunt?}
<A>__{ethan ignores him, working. his computer jams with static as it connects to a bbs. the screen blinks and displays the familiar bible group service through which he's contacted max. when it asks him which chapter and verse for the posting, ethan flicks through the bible, looking for the next code. he begins to type.}
<D>__{max now might be an excellent time to interpret scripture face to face. meet on tgv, noon tomorrow. take seat 27. bring our mutual friend job.}
<A>__{krieger suddenly appears over his shoulder and knocks bible out of ethan's hands to the floor.}
<C>__{krieger}
<D>__{you're not going to any meeting without me.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{my contact is extremely shy.}
<A>__{he goes back to the computer, his finger hovering over the "enter" button. luther and claire watch this growing conflict closely. ethan sighs and stands up. krieger pulls out the blue disk he took from ethan in the computer room and waves it in front of him.}
<C>__{krieger}
<D>__{i don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you? not while i'm holding this.}

<A>__{he reaches into his briefcase and pulls out an identical disk. he puts it back in his jacket pocket. krieger stares for a second.}
<C>__{krieger}
<D>__{that's not it. that's not the list.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{what's the matter, you don't know this trick?}
<A>__{he holds the jacket pocket wide open, for krieger to look into. krieger does. the pocket is empty.}
<C>__{ethan }
<P>__{(mock surprise)}
<D>__{where did it go?! it's gone!}
<A>__{ethan walks over to claire, reaches into the pocket of the trousers she's wearing and pulls out the disk.}
<C>__{ethan }
<D>__{but not too far!}
<A>__{he palms the disk in his right hand.}
<C>__{ethan }
<D>__{i know what you're thinking, krieger. you're thinking, back in the computer room i was up here he was down there . he was carrying two discs.}
<A>__{while he talks, he rotates his hand, palm away from krieger. when he rotates it back, the disk is gone again. he holds up his left hand. it's there now.}
<C>__{ethan }
<D>__{so hard to keep track of these things.}
<A>__{ethan shows his hands now both are empty.}
<C>__{krieger}
<P>__{(fuming)}
<D>__{where is it?}

<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i thought you had it! do you actually think i'd let you have the noc list?}
<A>__{krieger just stares at him, shaken. claire laughs. krieger looks at her. he turns completely red. when he looks back at ethan, ethan holds two disks one in each hand.}
<C>__{krieger}
<D>__{try any sleight of hand with my money and i will cut your throat.}
<A>__{he tosses his worthless disk into the trash can and storms out, slamming the door behind him. ethan picks up the bible and sees drake hotel.}

<D>__{i'm so sorry. krieger was my call. i've never worked with him. i'm sorry, ethan.}

<D>__{krieger did have the noc list.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{now i want you to hold onto it.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{what makes you trust me?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{i'm not letting this list get out in the open.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{exactly, that's your job. tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open. what's the range of this thing?}
<C>__{luther}

<D>__{similar to methamphetamines, cat is seen by officials as one of the most powerful and dangerous drugs in the world. some thirty four cat labs have been seized so far, but the recently widowed mrs. hunt and her brother in law are believed to be involved in a global drug distribution network.}

<C>__{public official}
<D>__{i think it's sad, really. farmers, unless they're a conglomerate, are always operating on a paper thin margin. i'm afraid what we have here is a case of a naive and lonely widow with a lot of financial problems who chose to make money through illegal means.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{that was john fairchild, the dea agent in charge of this investigation. officials tell me that international law enforcement agents are expected to arrive here later today to question the hunts. this is joe jones, cnn, love in madison, wisconsin.}
