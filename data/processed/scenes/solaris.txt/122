<A>__{kelvin and rheya, in bed. she looks despondent.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior kelvin's room}
<A>__{kelvin is asleep. alone. after a long period of silence, we hear the faint sound of an instrument of some sort hitting the ground. after another beat, kelvin awakens. he notices that he is alone, and something tells him that's not a good sign.}

<L>__{interior lab}
<A>__{rheya is on the ground, convulsing. beside her is a small steel drum, which is spilling a strange looking liquid that solidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss. kelvin moves to rheya and is startled to see that half of her face and throat are burned away not melted as in a fire, but merely eaten cleanly away. he picks her up.}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{kelvin is carrying rheya. snow sticks his head out of a passing room.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{she drank liquid oxygen.}
<L>__{interior kelvin's room}
<A>__{kelvin puts rheya on the bed. her face and throat have returned to normal, but she is not breathing. kelvin goes and puts his head to her chest, but doesn't hear what he hoped to hear. he stands, still looking at her. snow seems very detached. an uncomfortably long moment as we realize she is actually not going to wake up.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{she's dead.}
<A>__{snow says nothing. then: her finger twitches. barely noticeable at first, but growing in intensity. kelvin sees it, and goes to her. she is starting to shake a little, as though cold.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{she'll come back, don't worry. but then what? my theory is she can only live here, that she will die if she leaves this ship.}
<A>__{kelvin is still looking at rheya, who is shaking a little harder; it's feeling like a seizure now.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{why do you think she hasn't suggested that? it's the most obvious solution: escape. she knows she can't leave here }
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{get out }
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{oh, this one you love? what about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space? you didn't love her?}
<A>__{rheya is shaking much harder now, kelvin tries to hold her still, but she's too strong. he stands, reluctantly, and watches her.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{what happens if she comes back? is that polygamy? and even if you could take her home, how would you get her through? you think they're not going to notice her?}
<A>__{rheya is shaking violently now, as if a rippling rhythmic force were coursing through her. snow, as he looks dispassionately on the two of them:}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{i never get used to them, these... "resurrections".}
<A>__{he leaves. rheya continues her process of "waking up" it's violent, even sexual. she spasms to a peak of some sort, and then slowly returns to normal. kelvin puts his hand on her forehead. she gradually begins to open her eyes. she looks at kelvin. it takes her a moment to realize she shouldn't be seeing him; she shouldn't be seeing anything. she should be dead. she begins to cry.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{what am i? why can't i die?}
<A>__{she turns away.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{i'm not rheya. you're always known that.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{rheya }
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{don't call me that.}
<A>__{he turns her over.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{listen: i don't care about anything but the fact that you are here. you are her, you are rheya.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{i'm disgusting.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{you're lying. i'm not human.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{rheya, i am not going back. i'm staying here with you.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{then you'll die.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{i want every second i can get with you.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{what will i do, if you die?}
<A>__{he doesn't know.}
