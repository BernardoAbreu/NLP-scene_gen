<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{it's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it? just the sort of setting in which i've always imagined myself.}
<A>__{alfred, on the sofa, can't resist letting out a snort of disgust.}
<C>__{penguin }

<D>__{i think you're a dirty little man with a }
<A>__{the penguin silences him by sweeping one arm across a tabletop, sending a bunch of priceless china figurines crashing to the floor. he points to alfred as frick and frack reappear.}

<D>__{see, boys, that's old money talking. after a while, they actually start to believe they've earned all this.}
