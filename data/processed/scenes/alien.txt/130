<L>__{interior maintenance level}
<A>__{roby, melkonis, and faust come carefully down a set of crude metal stairs, into a drab, functional section of the ship. the corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in the ceiling. the effect is ugly and confining. they stop at the foot of the stairs and move into position, spreading the net across the corridor.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{faust}
<P>__{(looking at tracker and nodding down the passageway)}
<D>__{that way.}
<A>__{they begin to walk down the passageway, footsteps clanging on the raw metal flooring. it is extremely dark.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{what happened to the lights?}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.}
<A>__{they switch on the helmet lights. camera follows them around a couple of turnings, and then:}
<C>__{faust }
<D>__{hold it.}
<A>__{they all stop quickly, almost stumbling.}
<C>__{faust }
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{it's within 4 meters.}
<A>__{roby and melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand. faust, prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of approaching the source of the signal. he moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker. the tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one wall. behind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down faust's face as he sets down the tracker and reaches for the little door. he raises the prod, grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod inside. with a nerve shattering squall, a small creature comes flying out of the cabinet, eyes glaring, claws flashing. instinctively, they throw the net over it, but:}
<C>__{roby}
<P>__{(very annoyed)}
<D>__{oh, hold it!}
<A>__{they open the net and release the creature. it is the cat. hissing and spitting, it scampers away.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{we're making fools of ourselves!}
<A>__{roby's communicator beeps.}
<C>__{roby}
<P>__{(into communicator)}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(over, filtered)}
<D>__{we've got it up here! it's trapped! get up here fast!}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{where are you?}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(over, filtered)}
<D>__{food storage room!}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{we're coming!}
<A>__{they dash for the stairs.}
