<L>__{interior orleans hold continuous}
<A>__{the slaves are hustled down one at a time into a dark, dank hold among barrels and boxes of freight...and rats. burch comes around and "checks" the chains; makes sure they are all secure and locked. satisfied, he heads up out of the hold. radburn follows. alone in the dark in the hold, john cries, as does eliza. solomon stares down burch for as long as he can, as if wishing bad things. as if wanting to exact some measure of revenge. but the greater insult is that burch and radburn, engaged in conversation, take no notice of solomon whatsoever. he is that insignificant to them. that fact, that reality, makes solomon boil with a rage he cannot express in words.}
