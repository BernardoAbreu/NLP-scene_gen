<L>__{interior airstrip depot}
<A>__{the depot, as temporary looking as the rest of devil's cauldron, is a boxcar shaped loading dock and warehouse with a corrugated steel roof. boxes, wood palettes and hand dollies are piled haphazardly about. eric and corbett navigate through the piles of boxes, inching toward the front door the door leading to the plane. suddenly, a string of overhead lights come on. eric goes for the .357, then stops when he sees meyerling, kenai and neff have come in the front door. kenai stomps his feet and shivers. grandstanding for the others, meyerling steps forward.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?}
<P>__{(no one argues)}
<D>__{that's good. now, eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{this isn't your concern. it's over, here and now.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(to meyerling)}
<D>__{sure, when you put a bullet in my back on the way out. easier for all involved.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{not a bad idea. face it, ben. there's no room in alaska for you any more.}
<A>__{meyerling pokes with his foot at a tipped over rack of eskimo paraphernalia masks, furs, big skin drums, fish and bear spears.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you're as antiquated as this shit.}
<A>__{meyerling moves toward corbett, but eric stands in his way.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{keep back.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{you're quite a piece of work, meyerling. the tide changes, you ride right along with it.}
<A>__{eric looks at neff.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{neff, you know better than this...}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you're an outsider, mr. desmond. step aside; stay out of it.}
<A>__{kenai and neff move in with meyerling. eric stands his ground and reaches for the .357 in his belt.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{suddenly, lemalle stumbles into the depot, the blankets and furs dragging at his feet. his right side is bathed in blood. half frozen, bled dry, he looks ready to drop down dead. in his left hand, impossibly, he still clutches the massive remington. he hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he bolts a round into the chamber with his injured right arm. bracing himself, he levels the rifle at eric. hearing the action of the rifle, eric turns. corbett reaches down, grabs a rusty eskimo spear in both his handcuffed hands, and hurls it. there is a deafening roar as lemalle's rifle discharges. lemalle flies back from the recoil and from the spear stuck clear through his chest. some packing material above eric's head smolders, ignited by the muzzle blast.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence. corbett looks at the other weapons near him, and then at meyerling. threatened, meyerling pulls out a .380 automatic. before eric can do anything, meyerling fires. the impact of the bullet throws corbett against some boxes. with a yell, eric jumps meyerling and rips the gun from his grasp. enraged, he pummels meyerling with it until kenai and neff pull them apart. eric wrenches away from them and scrambles to his feet with meyerling's gun in his hand.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{anybody moves and i will shoot!}
<A>__{holding the .380 on them, eric crosses to corbett. bleeding from the abdomen, he's trying to stand up.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{can you walk?}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{wound's a through and through. missed my liver, i think.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{let's get out of here.}
<A>__{cautiously backing away from the others, eric helps corbett get up and shuffle toward the os sound of the cargo plane.}
