<L>__{interior dr. berger's office evening}
<A>__{calvin laughs nervously, all smiles.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<P>__{(os)}
<D>__{that's good.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{in the car, i was thinking: "be clear.". i suppose that's what psychiatry's about. being precise and clear. and honest, of course. i will level with you. i'm not a great believer in psychiatry.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i know what happens here is only between you and him, and...i like that, i respect that. and...he's better, i can see that. i am not trying to put you down, i just don't believe in psychiatry as a panacea for everybody.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{neither do i.}
<A>__{calvin laughs.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i wish i knew what the hell i was doing here.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{well, you said you... thought you could shed some light on some things. what did you mean by that?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i don't know actually, i'm not sure, i think i meant in terms of conrad. you see, i knew something was wrong even before he tried to... to kill himself. but i thought that... it's clear that he's very smart. he's been an "a" student ever since he started school, and naturally i thought that ...intelligent people could work out their own problems.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{but you still feel responsible?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{yeah, sure i do. it's hard not to. it was luck. it was just luck that i happened to be there when he tried it. i could have been at a meeting. we both could've been away. it was luck!}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{you think of yourself as a lucky man, then?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{no! no. no. i used to. i used to think... that i was a lucky person... before... the "accident". mmm, i guess the whole of life is nothing but an accident, is it? what happens to you. i should do with it.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{that sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax attorney.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{yeah. maybe, maybe i am drifting a little. i can see myself, ...and i can see the two of them drifting away from me, and i just stand there watching.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{what would you want to do about that?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{something. i gotta do something about it. i don't know what.}
<C>__{calvin }
<D>__{i feel like i'm sitting on a fence, and i don't like it.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{and you see them as on ...opposite sides of this fence?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{yeah... no. i don't know. i see her not being able to forgive him.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{oh, i don't know exactly. being too much like her. people always think that she and buck are... were ...were alike. but it's really she and conrad. they were the only two that didn't cry at the funeral, you know? it's not easy for me to admit this but, uh... she didn't... his mother doesn't show him a great deal of affection. i'm not trying to put her down in any way at all. she is a wonderful woman, huh...}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{did she give buck much affection to ...buck?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{oh, god, yes, she loved buck! bucky got so much... i think what she felt for him was special. you know, he was her first born. that's not unusual, is it?}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{and you?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{me? i loved buck.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{what i mean is, your wife's affection.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{for me you mean?}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{mmm. she's very... no. there's no problem with her for me. we've been... we've been married nearly twenty one years. everybody loves beth. but, huh... for conrad, it's been difficult. he didn't talk about that? we don't know what happens here. it doesn't come up. i guess that's what it is. it's private here. isn't it?}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{mm hmm. very private.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i think i know why i came here. i think i came here to talk about myself.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{okay. why don't we?}
