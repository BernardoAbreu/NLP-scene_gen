<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior lovely area on a hill day}
<A>__{miles brings the saab to a stop, and the guys get out. before them lies an incredible view of endless vineyards.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{nice, huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{beautiful.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{victoria and i used to like this view.}
<P>__{(lost in nostalgia)}
<D>__{once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 opus one. with smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{miles.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{she has the best palate of any woman i've ever known. she could even differentiate italian wines.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{miles, i gotta tell you something. victoria's coming to the wedding.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i know. you told me. i'm okay with it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah, but that's not the whole story. she got remarried.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{she what?}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{about a month ago. six weeks.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{to that guy? that guy with the restaurant...}
<A>__{jack nods. miles looks down at his shoes and draws a long breath. then he stiffly gets back in the open car and closes the door.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{miles... miles...}
<A>__{miles continues to stare straight ahead.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{jesus christ, miles. get out!}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i want to go home now.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you've been divorced for two years already. people move on. she has! it's like you enjoy self pity. makes you feel special or something.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{is she bringing him to the wedding?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you drop this bombshell on me. why didn't you tell me before?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{because i knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. but then i figured here would be the best place to tell you. we're here to forget about all that shit. we're here to party!}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(undeterred)}
<D>__{i'm going to be a fucking pariah. everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if i'm going to get drunk and make a scene. plus tony fucking levin?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, no, no. it's cool. i talked to victoria. she's cool. everyone's cool.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{you've all been talking about it? behind my back? talking about it?}
<A>__{miles turns and locates an open bottle of wine in the back seat. he uncorks it and begins to swig.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, hey, hey. no, you don't!}
<A>__{jack tries unsuccessfully to grab the bottle from miles, but miles bolts out of the car. a very wide shot pursued by jack, miles dashes down the hill, all the while taking huge swigs from the bottle.}
