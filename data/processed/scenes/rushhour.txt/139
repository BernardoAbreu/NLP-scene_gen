<A>__{everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way. it appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then it gains altitude, gyrating wildly just above the geo. javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners smashes through the top of the windshield, wedging itself against the inside of the geo's roof. snared, the little geo is lifted off the ground instantly too high for a terrified javal to escape from it.}
