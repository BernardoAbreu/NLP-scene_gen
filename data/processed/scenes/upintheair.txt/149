<A>__{ ryan and alex dance like teenagers. the band does a cheesy choreographed dance step. jim makes a speech. he is not good at public speaking, but the guests are generous with laughter. tammy has her tongue down a groomsmen's throat. ryan pulls kara onto the dance floor. she rests her head on his shoulder and they slow dance. jim and julie make their farewell and run off. ryan and alex help pick the center pieces off the tables. ryan and alex get into the elevator together. she's wearing his jacket. we're about to see them kiss, when the elevator door closes.}
