<A>__{a wider street than the last but just as empty. dora sways her way towards a small house. camera follows at a respectful distance. camera pans from dora's hips to an overflowing dustbin. close shot of a man's hand throwing something into the dustbin. it is an empty packet marked kodak film. camera pans to dora's house. it stands next to a chemist shop. dora climbs the few steps which lead to her front door glances round at us encouragingly then unlocks the door.}
