<A>__{othar's portrait, upside down, seems to be looking bemusedly down on us. an objective angle shows dorr lying on the couch, a damp washcloth on his forehead, eyes rolled back to look at the picture. mrs. munson is entering with a cup of tea. dorr swings his feet out to sit up and accept the tea.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i thank you, madam, for your act of kindness.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{well you let him out.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i certainly did and i do apologize no end. allow me to present myself, uh, formally: goldthwait higginson dorr, ph.d.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{what, like elmer?}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{beg your pardon, ma'am?}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{fudd?}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{no no, ph.d. is a mark of academic attainment. it is a degree of higher learning bestowed, in my case, in recognition of my mastery of the antique languages of latin and greek. i also hold a number of other advanced degrees including the baccalaureate from a school in paris, france, called the sorbonne.}
<A>__{munson chuckles.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{sore bone, well i guess that's appropriate. you ever study at bob jones university?}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i have not had that privilege.}

<D>__{it's a bible school, only the finest in the country. i send them five dollars every month.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{that's very gener }
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{i'm on their mailing list. i'm an angel.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{indeed.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{they list my name in the newsletter, every issue. i got the literature here, you wanna examine it.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{perhaps when my head has recovered from its... buffeting. mrs. munson, are you at all curious as to why i darkened your door, as the expression has it, on this lovely camelia scented morn?}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{i was wondering, til you let pickles out. then in all the excitement }
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i quite understand. the fact is that i saw the sign on your window advertising a room to let, and it is the only such sign among the houses of this charming, charming street.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{yeah, i got a room. i'm lookin' for a quiet tenant. fifteen dollars a week}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i quite understand. madam, you are addressing a man who is quiet and yet not quiet, if i may offer a riddle...}
<A>__{he sets down the teacup and rises.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...perhaps you can show me the room, mrs. munson, and allow me to explain.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{well you can see the room, but i don't like double talk.}
<A>__{mrs. munson precedes him...}
