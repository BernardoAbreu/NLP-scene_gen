<A>__{raymond is passed out on the sofa. paul sits, gun in hand, the barrel pointed at raymond's forehead. his finger grazes the trigger... but it's suddenly all too real. paul lowers the gun, takes a deep breath and tries again. not wanting to be sprayed by raymond's gray matter, he half turns his head... another idea comes to him. paul picks up a plastic picnic plate to use as a shield from the blow back. he gets ready to fire again, then makes the mistake of looking at raymond. maybe it's the light... maybe it's the small puddle of drool on the cushion, but he looks almost angelic. paul stares at his brother. in the kitchen, paul fills a glass with water, empties the pistol's bullets into the cup and hides it on the top shelf. paul puts the gun back. not sure of his next move, he spots the beat up clock radio lying next to his brother.}
