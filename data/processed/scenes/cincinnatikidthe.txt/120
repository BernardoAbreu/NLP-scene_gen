<L>__{interior poker suite the kid lancey and poker hands}
<A>__{both men are showing the strain. perhaps lancey the most as he appears to be consistently losing. showing are two nines and two odd cards.}
<C>__{lancey's voice }
<D>__{i'm going to pay the price to look at that third nine.}
<A>__{the kid turns up another nine and reaches for the money.}
<C>__{lancey's voice }
<D>__{caveat emptor. new deck, please.}
<A>__{(time lapse) the poker table from behind the kid he shows a pair of eights and two odd cards against lancey's pair of queens. he takes another look at his hole card, and we see that it is of no help to him.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{pair of eights bets an even thousand dollars.}
<B>__{hoban and yeller}
<A>__{they are both sitting on the back of the loveseat now. the binoculars pass from one to the other. both men are tense over the growing excitement of the game.}
<C>__{yeller}
<D>__{ten bucks and my notoriously fallible instinct tells me the boy is bluffing this time.}
<C>__{hoban}
<D>__{mark it.}
<A>__{camera moves to the other four remaining spectators: christian, melba, the shooter and bill. they are close enough to see the cards but too close to discuss them.}
<B>__{the poker table}
<A>__{the kid has almost half the money in front of him now, and is playing with increasing assurance and pressure.}
<C>__{lancey}
<P>__{(turning his cards)}
<D>__{i'm not that curious.}
<B>__{hoban and yeller}
<C>__{hoban}
<P>__{(excitement in his voice)}
<D>__{the kid is pushing it and making it stick.}
<A>__{camera moves to the other four spectators as they react to the kid's successful streak.}
<C>__{shooter}
<P>__{(in a low voice)}
<D>__{he's getting to him.}
<A>__{and it looks that way. lancey appears old and unsure. the kid sharp and cold. a young barracuda moving in for the kill. camera moves in close to christian as she tries to catch the kid's eye. thinking she has it, she smiles her encouragement.}
<B>__{featuring the kid}
<A>__{he looks right at her and doesn't seem to see her. lady fingers has dealt the first up cards of a new hand, and lancey is high.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{two hundred.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{and up five.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{fold.}
<A>__{close christian amid the growing excitement and tension she is a complete outsider. (time lapse)}
<B>__{the poker table}
<A>__{the kid shows two jacks and two odd cards; lancey a pair of aces and two odd cards. lancey puts about eight hundred dollars into the pot.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{betting the jack isn't there, kid.}
<A>__{the kid exposes his hidden jack. shooter, bill and melba greed and an almost vicious satisfaction marks their faces as they watch lancey falter. the shooter whispers to bill just loud enough for the girl to hear.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{we're in i think he's got him.}
<A>__{christian looks at them, then at the kid. hesitates a moment then suddenly gets to her feet and starts for the door. only melba notices her, and even she doesn't have time to question her. camera follows christian to the suite entrance, where she picks up her bag then turns to look back at the table.}
<B>__{featuring the kid}
<A>__{the place where christian was sitting is right in his line of vision but he hasn't observed her departure. close shot christian she goes on out the door.}
