<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior fairvale presbyterian church (morning)}
<A>__{an overcast morning, but a sunny faced crowd. the service is just over, there is contentment, and peace, and just a little i went to church smugness in the faces of the churchgoers as they come out of the chapel, and spread their separate ways away. amongst the crowd, waiting and searching the faces, are sam and lila. in their expressions there is no peace, no contentment. camera moves in close. they are not speaking. lila looks as if she has had no sleep. suddenly, sam becomes alert, takes lila's arm, starts toward the church. camera moves with them, stops as they approach sheriff and mrs. chambers. the sheriff stares rather sympathetically at lila. mrs. chambers smiles nicely.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<D>__{he's already been.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{went out before service.}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<D>__{have you two had breakfast?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to sheriff, not a question)}
<D>__{you didn't find anything.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{nothing. here, let's clear the path.}
<A>__{he moves away and the others follow. camera pans them to the curb.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{did he say anything about my sister?}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{just what he told your detective.}
<A>__{she used a fake name, saw the register myself. saw the whole place, as a matter of fact. that boy is alone there.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no mother.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{you must've seen an illusion, sam. now, i know you're not the seeing illusion type... but no woman was illusion there and i don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i still feel...}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{can see you do. sorry i couldn't make you feel better. you want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... and the theft, is what you want to do! sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. how about that?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<D>__{it's sunday. come over and do the reporting at the house, 'round dinner time. make it nicer. you too, sam.}
<A>__{she smiles brightly, as if having invited them over to discuss this year's charity fandango, takes the sheriff's arm, starts away. the sheriff nods as he goes. sam and lila are alone now, at the curb, before the deserted chapel. for a long moment they just stand there, their faces as gray and overcast as the sky.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{maybe i am the seeing illusions type.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{you're not.}
<A>__{sam takes her arm, starts walking her up the street toward the spot where his pick up truck is parked. camera follows them.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{want me to drop you at the hotel? or you want to come over to the store?}
<A>__{lila does not answer. they reach the truck. lila looks directly at sam as he helps her into the cab.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i won't feel satisfied unless i got out there, sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{neither will i.}
<A>__{he slams the door, hurries around truck, gets into driver's seat, starts motor. as the truck drives off,}
