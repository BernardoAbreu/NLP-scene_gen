<A>__{enters and closes the door and greets malcolm x, in a white shirt, no tie, and cassius, eating ice cream in a pool of light from the tv. malcolm's wife, betty shabazz, comes out of the kitchenette. a little girl runs from the bathroom back to cassius. the girl plops into his lap with much familiarity, so we understand cassius is family and has been for a while. he's not at the fontainebleau or the roney plaza. it says cassius' sense of himself is more about what's next than what he did tonight.}

<D>__{the mummy! "i can't get away from the mummy!" yeah, but that mummy too slow to catch anybody.}
<C>__{sam cooke}
<D>__{hey! the mummy always gets his man...}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{no, he don't!}
<P>__{(to kid)}
<D>__{now, don't believe that stuff on television...}
<A>__{laughter from the outside. cassius looks. he's not drawn to all the partying. malcolm takes a picture with his contax. through the door enters jim brown. jim embraces malcolm and betty, sam cooke, and congratulates the new champ and helps himself to food.}
