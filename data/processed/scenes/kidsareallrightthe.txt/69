<D>__{oh, yeah, they're spending all kinds of quality time together.}
<C>__{stella}
<P>__{(senses the sarcasm)}

<A>__{nic grabs a passing waiter by the arm.}
<C>__{nic }

<C>__{stella}
<D>__{i know. joel's addicted.}

<P>__{(mocking voice)}
<D>__{"oh no, don't throw that in the trash, no man, you gotta throw that into the composting bin so the fucking worms can shit all over it and turn it into glorious multch and we can all feel better about ourselves." god! what a bunch of bullshit!}
<A>__{nic takes a big swallow from her glass. jules windshield wipes nic's forearm.}
<C>__{jules}
