<L>__{interior poolhouse day}
<A>__{they burst in and line up shoulder to shoulder, guns aimed. smecker stands beside rocco with his thumb and forefinger extended to mimic guns. five mafiosos sit around a poker table in front of time. two men are playing pool to their left. rocco quickly scans the room.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{all of them.}
<A>__{they begin firing. men are dying, their chests exploding. smecker moves his hands like firing guns and yells over the noise.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{nobody was ready for it. devastation, panic! this was like shooting fish in a fuckin' barrel!}
<A>__{smecker points to the pool table as the two players dive under it.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{now these guys dove under the table. the trajectory on the bullets show they came from straight across. so this means one of our shooters... dropped to his knees...}
<A>__{smecker drops to his knees in perfect synchronicity with rocco. they are side by side and leaning back. rocco fires and the men under the table skip around as they are riddled with bullets. smecker's mimicking hands follow him perfectly with each shot. the boys and rocco demask. rocco goes around to all the bodies and looks earnestly at each one, as connor and murphy pick up bullet casings.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{shit!... shit! he ain't here.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{what the fuck do you mean?}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{i mean he ain't here.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{look again for fuck sake!}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{i know what the fuck he looks like!}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{something went wrong. right here.}
