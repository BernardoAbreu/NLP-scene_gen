<L>__{exterior used car lot day}
<A>__{harry comes barrelling into the lot at forty. he cranks the wheel and hits the emergency brake, slewing the car into a smoking bootlegger 180. it screeches backward, sliding right into its parking space perfectly. simon is bugeyed. but he is non plussed for only about two seconds. then he's back to selling. he scrambles out and goes around to harry, coughing in the cloud of tire smoke.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{see. you and this car were meant for each other. why fight it? sure, i have a couple other buyers lined up, but i like your style. whattya say? should we start on the paperwork?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{let me think about it. hold it a day for me?}
<A>__{simon grins and winks.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{because it's you.}
