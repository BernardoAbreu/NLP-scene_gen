<A>__{a few kids start playing "can can." it catches on, and more of them join in. passersby stop to listen, and some drop change into the open cases. ramon and a couple of other kids grin at this. carlos steps in front of the kids as he plays, and begins an uncanny imitation of roberta:}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{more bow! to the frog! you sound terrible! i can't believe how terrible you sound!}
<A>__{the kids crack up, but a few spot roberta heading quickly up the street. carlos is oblivious to this and no one signals him that roberta's watching.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{you're gonna make everyone in carnegie hall sick to their stomachs! that's right, they're gonna pay a thousand dollars a ticket and you're gonna make them throw up on their gowns and tuxedos!}
<A>__{carlos senses a presence and turns to see roberta. a tense beat as he awaits her reaction.}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(in all seriousness)}
<D>__{if you're gonna imitate me, do it right.}

<A>__{roberta nods, and addresses the kids as she unlocks the gate.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{he's right, by the way. you do sound terrible, and you are gonna make everyone in carnegie hall sick to their stomachs.}
<A>__{the kids start filing in. rachel comes up the street and catches up to roberta.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i need to talk to you.}
<A>__{roberta sees how distressed rachel looks.}
