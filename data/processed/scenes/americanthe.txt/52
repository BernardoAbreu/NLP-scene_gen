<L>__{exterior town square day}
<A>__{father benedetto is sitting in his api three wheeler. this comical and endearing method of rural transportation is a cross between a moped and a miniature pick up truck. in the back of the truck are a mass of writhing snakes. the api is turning over but it won't start. the bonnet is open. jack is fixing the engine. he gives a signal and father benedetto turns the ignition key again. this time the engine starts. father benedetto claps and cheers.}
