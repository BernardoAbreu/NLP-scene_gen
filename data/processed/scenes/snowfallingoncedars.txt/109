<T>__{cut :}
<A>__{to the defendant. ramrod straight, nothing revealed in his face. and to his wife. elegant, erect. her eyes flooded with tears.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{still and all. carl was a strong swimmer, he m...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{he hit his head. on the way in.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you think so?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{the sheriff and the deputy and i inspected the deck closely. we found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel. just below the mast.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{well, anything coulda caused that.}
<A>__{ishmael nods. no smile at all.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{anything. that had a blond hair.}
<A>__{and nels is walking now. toward the prosecutor's table. pulling a small cellophane bag from hisinside pocket.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{request introduction of exhibit 18. one single blond hair. which sheriff moran dug out of that fracture. below the mast. of carl heine's boat.}
<A>__{lays the bag on the table. just in front of hooks. turns to the judge.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{we will call sheriff moran, who will confirm this. and coroner whaley to testify that the damage to the gunnel is of a size and nature not inconsistent with the deceased's skull fracture...}
<A>__{turns to the prosecutor...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{but for now. your witness...}
<A>__{and just strolls on over to his seat. looks in his client's eyes. how 'bout them apples? kabuo loves this old guy. and right here, he lets a little of that show. across the way, the prosector is rising. he smiles. friendly, almost amused.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i have to start reading your paper more closely. you're quite a storyteller.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{thank you. coming from the man who wrote, 'but here, adrift in the fog, i plead for your help'...that's quite a compliment.}
<A>__{there is a ripple of laughter. but no smile on ishmael's features. his game face is on. come and get me, sucker. and hooks does come, one step at a time. straight to the box.}
<D>__{hooks everything had to happen just right. for your little story to fly. i mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a lot of reasons.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i'm sorry, was there a question in there?}
<A>__{no love lost. and no pretense about it. hatsue miyamoto sits with her hand in her mother's. watching these men battle for her husband's life.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{well, the freighter. the twine. the blood. the knife. the cup. the watch. the second battery. the phantom lantern. the fishing gaff. the cracked gunnel. the skull wound. the blond hair. that's eleven things...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{twelve.}
<A>__{hooks smiles.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i stand corrected, sir. and you have a neat explanation for every one of them.}
<A>__{hooks nods. yes, you do.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{and since you confess this is all pure guesswork. what is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{my expertise. is that i'm a journalist.}
<A>__{right at his eyes.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{and journalism. is balance. finding the facts folks need to know.}
<A>__{the words ring with quiet, heartfelt conviction, that others cannot fully appreciate.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{then putting them together. so truth is revealed.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{but isn't the truth that there are several other ways to explain each of these twelve pieces.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{oh, yes.}
<A>__{and the prosecutor stops. confused for an instant by this confession. until...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{but no other way. to explain them all.}
<A>__{a heart stopping hush. as everyone, as hooks himself, sees the cehckmate.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{and since they all happened. this is the only explanation that's the truth.}
<A>__{the prosecutor looks like he's been slapped. like every act of will is necessary to maintain composure. to find the easy, untroubled smile.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{your line of work. you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{like you couldn't believe.}
<A>__{service returned. hooks leans in.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{well, the defendant is a liar. he's confessed that much. and his explanation is...he was afraid.}
<A>__{and leans in some more.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{afraid that the good folks of this jury. would be too stupid to understand. too prejudiced to be fair.}
<A>__{shakes his head.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{you buy that?}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i think he was greedy.}
<A>__{and once more. the prosecutor can only blink. can only move toward the trap.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{greedy.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{he didn't want to lose any more.}
<A>__{no smile. no smile as the trap springs shut.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{he'd lost a lot in the war, you see. i had sent him away. to a concentration camp. but a nice one. far less brutal than the nazis. because i'm a civilized person.}
<A>__{he stops. lets hooks clear his throat.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{that's how journalists. answer questions.}
<A>__{turns to judge fielding. with all respect...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{may i answer the question, your honor? anout the defendant's motivation to lie?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i wouldn't miss it for the world, son. now, you say you sent the defendant to manzanar?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i didn't say. i did it alone.}
<A>__{and things get real quiet.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{so there he was. his father lost his health there, finally died. they lost more than etta heine's seven acres. they lost their liberty, their dignity. their ideals about this country.}
<A>__{so much feeling in this. he has to stop. swallow hard.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{they lost their trust in us. we had treated them worse than animals. how would we now see tham. as human beings?}
<A>__{tells the jury. straight to their faces.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{this man lost a lot in the war. he didn't want now to lose his babies. or the woman who loves him.}
<A>__{another level of quiet. he turns to the prosecutor...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{and my expertise in this, sir. is that i lost a lot in the war myself.}
<A>__{words coming from someplace very deep.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{and the fact that i am the only witness. who placed his right hand upon the holy bible. is the least of it, sir. i assure you of that.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{well, sir. i hate to spoil the soliloquy, i truly do. but the fact is...you are not on trial here. nor is judge fielding, or myself. nor the good people of this jury. for events that took place twelve years ago.}
<A>__{no sir.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{and i wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent ful. at a tactic that insults their intelligence.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{that's curious. i was appealing to their intelligence.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{were you, sir? can you prove one word of all your fancy story?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{no, sir, i can't. not beyond a reasonable doubt.}
<A>__{and he smiles. first time.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{it's fortunate that the man who needs to prove his fancy story. beyond a reasonable doubt. is someone else.}
<A>__{there is laughter in the room, so welcome is any chance to relieve the tension. the gavel bangs.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. hooks. i apologize for my tone. this is not a contest. between you and me.}
<A>__{shakes his head. no, it isn't.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{for it is not. as mr. gudmundsson so wisely put it. a small trial. in a small place.}
<A>__{his eyes are damp now. strangely enough, after all this. he is at last on the brink of losing control. because...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i lost more in that war than anyone will ever know. so did a lot of folks. and what we got back in return...}
<A>__{his voice breaks slightly. but it rings with dignity on...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{...was a country. where a man was innocent. until we proved him guilty.}
<A>__{and the voice drops. to just above a whisper...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{whether we all got cheated. we're about to find out.}
