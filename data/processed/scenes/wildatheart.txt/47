<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{in a fire, as i recall.}
<C>__{lula}
<D>__{started he couldnt remember things? got real violent? mama kept tellin me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin the old paint off our house without usin a mask... but i dont know. seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.}
