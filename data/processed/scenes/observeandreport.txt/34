<A>__{ronnie talks to dennis in the middle of the mall.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{okay, dennis. i've gotta hang with detective harrison.}
<C>__{ronnie }
<D>__{what i need for you to understand is that just because detective harrison is here, doesn't mean that you and me are no longer best friends. sure, harrison would be cool to hang out with. he carries a badge and a gun. he probably owns a boat. over time, we'll probably become really close like brothers, but for right now, you're still number one. now, i must leave you behind because duty calls, so... chin up. radio if you need anything.}
<A>__{ronnie takes off, but we stay with dennis. he walks directly to the arcade. dennis puts a quarter in the machine and plays pinball.}
