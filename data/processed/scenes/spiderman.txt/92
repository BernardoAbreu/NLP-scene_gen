<A>__{every cop's weapon is trained upward at spider man!}
<D>__{cop #2}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{we got an accomplice up there! and we got a clear shot. do we have a go?}
<C>__{radio}

<D>__{that's a go.}
<L>__{exterior warehouse wall night}
<A>__{gunshots erupt around spider man and he skitters around to evade them.}
<L>__{interior the warehouse night}
<A>__{thinking they're shooting at him, weiner shoots back. in the corner of his eye he sees spider man at a side window. he aims his rifle and spidey ducks out of the way. the frightened weiner moves to the side window to blow spidey away. as he moves past the front windows he is lit by the searchlights that play on his face darkly. spidey leaps in at front window and drops neatly behind weiner, landing a pose.}
<D>__{spider man}
<P>__{(cold, hard)}
<D>__{say your prayers, weiner!}
<A>__{weiner whips around and fires. spidey leaps to avoid it and lands on a stack of paint cans.}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{you ain't takin' me... spider man... who ever you are...}
<A>__{spidey gathers himself tighter. he leaps. a second gun burst comes in behind him, several paint cans erupt in cascades of color.}
<D>__{spider man}
<P>__{(hanging on ceiling)}
<D>__{hey, creep!}
<A>__{weiner aims and fires, several times. he is emptying his rifle. spidey leaps away and lands on the top of a cask marked "caution flammable solvent!"}
<D>__{spider man}
<P>__{(taunting)}
<D>__{try again.}
<A>__{the cask gives way and spidey is plunged into the flammable solvent. weiner smiles his stupid grin and takes aim. spidey leaps out of the cask and sticks to the roof beam. he's sopping wet. his hand slips down the beam as the solvent works against his sticking power. he falls to the floor and scrambles behind some paint cans. weiner, crazed, fires wildly. one of the cans explodes. paint flows from it... burning! spidey peeks out and sees a yellow river of flame creeping toward him. he sniffs his solvent soaked outfit. he backs down a "corridor" of paint cans. the yellow fire follows, now joined by a river of blue fire from another can. they're following the trail of solvent he's dripping! he's trapped!}
<C>__{cop }
<P>__{(on bullhorn)}
<D>__{this is your last chance, you two. either you're coming out, or we're coming in!}
<A>__{spidey's against the wall! paint cans to his right and left, and a river of red flame joins the yellow and blue as they creep toward him! he climbs backwards up the wall, face toward the blaze. the colored fires join and follow him up the wall! they're licking at his feet!}
<C>__{weiner}
<P>__{(at the window)}
<D>__{stay back!}
<P>__{(gun burst)}
<D>__{whoa... stay back down there!}
<A>__{spidey is inches from being torched. he sees a pipe. he reaches out and grabs it. he swings out above the flames. but the pipe begins to bend! the pipe bends down... down... and then breaks! spidey hangs precariously as water cascades out of the pipe and puts out the fire. spidey drops down and rest his head in his hands to collect himself. then looks up. the gun is at his head.}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{stand up, you.}
<A>__{spidey stands.}
<C>__{cop }
<D>__{you have thirty seconds to come out!}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{you're my ticket outa here. gimme that stupid mask!}
<A>__{spider man hesitates. then he begins to raise the mask, but stops and shakes his head no.}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{then i will take it myself.}
<A>__{he reaches for the mask and spider man flips him across the room. weiner lands in a cargo net and becomes ensnared.}
<D>__{spider man well, look what we've caught in our web...}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{don't hurt me, man. please don't hurt me...}
