<L>__{interior junior league headquarters morning}
<A>__{hilly stands at a podium banging a gavel. the pleats of her navy blue sailor's number fan out like an accordion. a room full of junior league members sits up and quiets down. half the girls are pregnant and most all drink tab and are smoking. skeeter sits in the back next to elizabeth.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{we're running behind on our "coat drive," girls. so hurry up and clean out those closets...but our christmas benefit, however, is right on schedule as y'all have already filled all our baked goods raffle slots.}
<A>__{the girls applaud, turning to each other with praise.}
<C>__{hilly }
<D>__{y'all think we can put a dent in the african children's hunger this year?}
<A>__{more applause. those who aren't pregnant, stand. hilly beams. elizabeth nudges skeeter out of her chair.}
<C>__{hilly }
<D>__{now for some exciting news...i wanted y'all to be the first to know...my william is seeking election to the state senate this november!}
<A>__{now, even the pregnant women stand. elizabeth grabs skeeter's arm and pulls herself up.}
<C>__{hilly }
<D>__{he's runnin' on a platform of health. protecting our children. protecting our way of life. so, i, with william, have drafted the home health sanitation initiative.}
<A>__{this sets off a room of whispers.}
<C>__{hilly }
<D>__{skeeter, when can we expect to see the initiative in the newsletter? i gave it to you a month ago.}
<A>__{everyone turns to skeeter. elizabeth panics.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i gave that to you myself!}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{i, ah...well, i }
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{would you please stand, skeeter?}
<A>__{as skeeter rises, several women shake their heads.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{i will have it in there soon.}
<A>__{skeeter glances at the initiative tucked in her satchel.}
