<L>__{exterior erin's house day}
<A>__{a shitty little house in a shitty part of northbridge. the hyundai with a bashed in side pulls up to the curb. erin gets out, takes the mail from her mailbox, then heads over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell. a hispanic woman in her 60's opens the door, holding a white baby. this is mrs. morales.}
<C>__{mrs. morales}
<D>__{hi, erin! you're back so soon. how was it?}
<A>__{she hands erin the baby. it's beth, erin's 9 month old. erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{hi, sweetie. were you a good girl? where are matt and katie?}
<C>__{mrs. morales}
<D>__{outside with the sprinkler. so it's good?}
<A>__{the truth is too depressing to share.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{it'll be fine, yeah.}
<C>__{mrs. morales}
<D>__{ai, bueno. because i didn't want to tell you before, with your worries }
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mrs. morales}
<D>__{my daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me. i'm going to move in with her.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{you're moving away? when?}
<C>__{mrs. morales}
<D>__{next week.}
<C>__{erin}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{wow, that's soon }
<C>__{mrs. morales}
<D>__{i know. but it's good for me. now i can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. and it's good for you, too. now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? not the old lady next door.}
<A>__{oh, god. in erin's arms, beth starts to cough.}
