<L>__{interior tunnel chamber 144}
<A>__{the tunnel ends at a slightly larger, rounded chamber with walls of solid rock. they can't go any further. cobwebs and thick dust hang everywhere. carnby, aline, burke, barr, cheung, and marko emerge out of the tunnel into the chamber.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{it's a dead end.}
<A>__{agent barr checks his para meter.}
<C>__{agent barr}
<D>__{readings are getting stronger.}
<A>__{carnby looks around, sensing something. he wipes away some cobwebs and dust and runs his hand over the chamber walls.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{we'll double back. take another tunnel.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{wait. aline, look at this...}
<A>__{aline approaches the spot where carnby stands. she shines her flashlight beam in the wiped off area. faint abkani symbols are carved into the wall.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{they're abkani.}
<A>__{the agents all start wiping away the cobwebs and dust, examining the walls for more symbols. they all shine their beams of light through the dark space, searching. cheung finds more abkani symbols on another wall.}
<C>__{agent cheung}
<D>__{there's more over here.}
<A>__{as agent marko moves through the space with his lamp, his boot hits a small protrusion in the dusty ground. agent marko shines his lamp down on ground. with his boot, he pushes away the dust on the ground. there's a carving on the floor. agent barr spots marko and shines his lamp towards him.}
<C>__{agent barr}
<D>__{what do you got, marko?}
<A>__{agent marko presses down on the carving with his boot. suddenly, the stone floor beneath agent marko crumbles away, revealing a deep circular shaft. agent marko can't hold on and he falls into the shaft. he screams as he falls.}
<C>__{agent barr }
<D>__{marko!}
