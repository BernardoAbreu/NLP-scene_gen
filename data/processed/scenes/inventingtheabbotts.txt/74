<D>__{pamela louise abbott...}
<A>__{pamela rises from her seat and takes her diploma. lloyd and joan abbott applaud their daughter. joan stands to take a snapshot. alice is occupied with her restless and fussy eighteen month old daughter, susan. doug watches pam return to her seat; she avoids his eyes. helen is all smiles, this is a very special day for her. the chair next to her is empty. she glances behind her and sees jacey standing in the back of the gym. jacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom. he is only there at his mother's insistence. his eyes settle on... alice abbott. alice tries to quiet her crying eighteen month old daughter (susan). lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to alice and she rises and carries susan up the aisle. jacey's eyes follow alice she notices his stare as she passes by with susan in her arms.}
