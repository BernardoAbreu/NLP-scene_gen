<A>__{eep doesn't want to.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{please. i hate the dark.}
<A>__{eep sees a kindred spirit. she gets out of his way. guy picks up the torch and blows. eep scoots closer to guy, staying in the circle of light around him. as guy brings the fire back to life, the relief on his face is familiar to eep. this boy seems to have power over light itself. eep is smitten.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{it does what you tell it?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{well, yeah, sort of.}

<A>__{eep squeezes guy like a tube of toothpaste.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you do this a lot.}
<A>__{something cracks. eep drops guy he's broken.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{are you dead? can i have your fire if you're dead?}
<A>__{belt rubs two flat rocks together and places them on guy's chest like defibrillator paddles. guy bolts upright.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{hey, those are cold!}
<C>__{belt}
<D>__{squirf!}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you think? listening shells, activate.}

<C>__{guy }
<D>__{i concur. tiger girl, we need to leave immediately.}
<A>__{he tries to pull her by the arm. she stays put like an anchor.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{i don't even know you.}

<P>__{(cutting her off)}
<D>__{let me clarify, eep. the world is ending.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i'm calling it...}
<P>__{(very dramatic)}
<D>__{the... end.}
<C>__{belt}
<D>__{da da daaaaa.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<A>__{guy and belt both do gestures to accompany the da da daaaa. it seems very important to them.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i've seen it. it's coming this way. first, the earth is going to shake. then it breaks open. everything falls in. fire. lava. i don't mean to sound too dramatic, but aaaaaaaugh. believe me, everything we're standing on, all this right here, will be gone.}
<A>__{again with the gestures. it's a little weird to eep.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{we've got to get to high ground. i know a mountain, that way }
<A>__{he points into the distance.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{it's our only chance.}
<P>__{(extending his hand)}
<D>__{come with me.}
<A>__{guy and belt reach out their hands to eep.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{i can't.}
<A>__{guy hands the shell to eep. and eep is mesmerized. guy pulls his hog mask back down.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{okay. here. if you survive, call me.}
<A>__{eep test blows the shell. it makes a sound, she giggles. when she looks up to thank guy, he is gone.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{thank you. hello? hey!}
<A>__{eep bumps directly into grug.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{dad!}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{are you hurt? what took you?}

<C>__{grug}
<D>__{you... youuuuuuu... ww what!?}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{dad, let me explain...}
<A>__{a low growl interrupts them. on the bear owl sniffing around. it passes over a log. crane down to reveal grug hanging under the log by one hand, eep dangling in the other.}
<C>__{eep }
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{you never let me talk.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{you're grounded.}
