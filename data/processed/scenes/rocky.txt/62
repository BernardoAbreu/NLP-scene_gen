<L>__{interior freezer day}
<A>__{they enter. the freezer resembles a modern torture chamber... row after row of hanging slabs of beef stretch into the darkness to the far end of the refrigerator. the blower overhead causes the men to speak loudly.}
<C>__{paulie}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{if ya don't pay gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{gazzo's a good man.}

<P>__{(tightly)}
<D>__{please do me that favor.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{keep this job, ya eat better.}
<A>__{paulie opens a jackknife and idly jabs the hanging meat. he swills whiskey from a pint bottle.}
<C>__{paulie}
<D>__{y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister ah, doin' good together?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{whatta you think?}

<D>__{ain't sure, what's the story?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{paulie}
<D>__{the story what's happenin'?}
<A>__{paulie speaks like a man who has been mulling this over for quite a while.}
<C>__{paulie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ya really like her?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{sure i like her.}
<C>__{paulie}
<P>__{(nervous laughter)}
<D>__{what's the attraction? i don't see it?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{i dunno she fills gaps.}
<C>__{paulie}
<D>__{what gaps?}
<C>__{rocky}
<P>__{(shrugs and takes meat)}
<D>__{she got gaps. i got gaps together we fill the gaps.}
<C>__{paulie}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{you ballin' her?}
<C>__{rocky}
<P>__{(turns around)}
<D>__{don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.}
<C>__{paulie}
<P>__{(tersely)}
<D>__{c'mon, ya screwin' her?}
<A>__{from across the room rocky looks him hard in the eyes.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{that's why i can't put ya together with gazzo, cause ya talk too much big mouth.}
<A>__{paulie reddens. he steps forward and slams his fists in a hanging beef. the punching of the beef is a muted challenge and rocky responds. rocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs. the grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging corpse. rocky moves to the next one and hooks. rocky's face reveals a never before seen concentration, as though he were locked in total battle.}
<C>__{paulie}
<D>__{hit the rump. the rump! ya'll break the ribs!}
<A>__{rocky speeds up and continues pounding on the second row of beef. paulie's eyes widen and his face grimaces with every punch, like he were receiving it. rocky moves into the dark recess of the refrigerator. only the dull sounds of his pounding fists can be heard. rocky works his way to paulie again. every hanging beef swings and appears surrealistically alive.}
<C>__{paulie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{we do that to creed an' they'll take us to jail for murder.}
<A>__{rocky looks at his hands. they are drenched in red up to the elbows with beef blood. paulie hands him a package of beef.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.}
<A>__{rocky takes the package and runs out. paulie's bleary eyes reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment.}
