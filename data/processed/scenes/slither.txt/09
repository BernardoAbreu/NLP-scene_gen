<L>__{interior diner later}
<A>__{the four cops move in. there's a commotion. most of the patrons are standing.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{back there, bill!}
<A>__{the waitress nods back through the service window, into the kitchen, where a large doe is hopping around. a dishwasher stands on the counter, yelping with fear.}
<L>__{interior diner kitchen moments later}
<A>__{bill, wally, trevor, margaret, and the waitress enter. the doe skips around.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{she slipped in, was eating trash. we seen it on tv, how they kill ya' }
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{so we thought we best call in.}
<A>__{bill spots the open rear door, and tries to herd the deer toward it.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{come on now, honey, door's this way.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{it's open season. let's shoot her.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{she's just scared, margaret.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{also, bill likes to take a female through the back door any chance he gets.}
<A>__{wally and margaret laugh. trevor snatches a dish towel and rushes the doe, using it like a cape. the scared doe leaps away from him, jumping onto the kitchen counter.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{she ain't a bull, trevor!}
<A>__{the animal kicks off a pot, which hits margaret.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{goddamn bambi rat!}
<A>__{as the doe jumps to the floor, she gets her hoof wrapped in a telephone cord. the cord is plugged into the wall, trapping the doe in place. wally, margaret, and trevor attempt to dive for the cord, but can't avoid the doe's crazy, flying hooves.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{get back.}
<A>__{the other cops step away. bill steps slowly toward the doe, speaking calmly.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it's okay, sweetheart. nobody's gonna hurt you.}
<A>__{the doe looks at him, settling a bit. his voice seems to be soothing her. bill gets closer.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's right. just gonna pull this cord out. it's gonna be all right.}
<A>__{the cops and restaurant folk look on in awe as the doe, breathing heavily, becomes still. bill scoops close past her, and yanks the telephone cord out of the wall. bill smiles. then the doe runs forward, almost knocking bill over, and streaks out the back door. bill, wally, margaret, and trevor move up to the doorway and watch the deer skitter off into the woods beyond, dragging the telephone, tied to her leg.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hell, she took a phone. now them forest critters are gonna be calling us all hours of the night.}
<A>__{everyone laughs. wally pretends to be on the phone.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{chief of police there? this a squirrel. bring me a bag of peanuts, motherfucker!}
<A>__{everyone laughs some more.}
