<L>__{interior anderson's chevy}
<A>__{anderson grips the wheel of his chevy, driving down 1 95. the fact that he can't control his car that the steering wheel has no function, his speed is predetermined, and his direction is guided by satellite is maddening now. from inside the cars that glide along beside him people turn and look curiously at the man who is actually gripping his steering wheel. anderson slams it with his fist. through his windshield anderson sees a four year old boy in the driver's seat of a passing red and black ford. his mother sits in the passenger's seat, blithely reading. the boy mimics anderson, gleefully slams his steering wheel too, then laughs. anderson turns and looks the other way, into the distance, at the "sprawl,' the vast unzoned city attached to washington d.c. you can see it in his face: a man could lose himself in there.}
