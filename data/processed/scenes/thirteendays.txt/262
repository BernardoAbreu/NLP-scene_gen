<L>__{2's tail and explodes in a blinding flash. interior hall outside bundy's office day}
<A>__{kenny, jogging down the hall, hears form an open door.}
<C>__{bundy }
<D>__{kenny!}
<A>__{kenny goes over to the threshold. inside the office bundy stands up from behind his desk, grave. and kenny knows.}
<L>__{interior cabinet room day}
<A>__{all of excom is there except for bundy. kenny sits behind the president, deeply distraught over major anderson.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the soviets?}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{the soviets are in control of the sams. it's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{mr. president, taken with the events of the past few hours, i believe this confirms our worst fears. we're now dealing with a hard line soviet government, perhaps with khruschev as a puppet head, perhaps not.}
<A>__{in the silence, kenny reads the faces around the room. they're convinced by mccone's pronouncement. kenny's not.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{it could be a mistake.}
<A>__{mccone gives him a get serious look. but kenny presses on.}
<C>__{kenny }
<D>__{we need to be positive before we react.}
<A>__{bundy enters the room. everyone looks up. he stands there in the doorway, his face tight. kenny sags in his chair. bundy, of course, has more bad news, and they all know it. a hopeless beat. the president just stares at bundy, unable to ask. bundy nods, affirming what everyone is thinking.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{a u 2 on a routine air sampling mission over siberia got lost and penetrated soviet airspace. the soviets scrambled migs in pursuit, thinking it was a bomber. it got out okay. somebody forgot to cancel the mission.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{goddammitt. there's always some sonofabitch who doesn't get the word. all we need is the soviets thinking we're bombing them.}
<P>__{(facetious)}
<D>__{anybody else?}
<A>__{the humor falls on a cold audience.}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{mr. president, our pilots are in danger. we must order punitive airstrikes against the sam site that shot down major anderson per our rules of engagement.}
<A>__{and finally the moment kenny has dreaded all this time has come to pass. he looks at bobby, then at the president. the president stares at the cup of coffee in his hands, as if trying to read the fates' design in it. a long beat, and everyone holds their breath.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{no. i want confirmation there wasn't some sort of accident first.}
<A>__{lemay clears his throat. everyone looks at him, expecting him to scream or jump up and down.}
<C>__{lemay}
<D>__{i think that's a good idea, mr. president. it'll be safer for my boys to get those sams on monday when we get the rest of the bastards. i can wait a day and a half.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{very well, then.}
<A>__{but he says it without any belief in the words, realizing they're being tied fast to the train tracks of war.}
