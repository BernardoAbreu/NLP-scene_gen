<A>__{we see some particularly memorable footage from the wizard of gore. mark and juno are watching the movie and drinking root beer floats. they're sitting dangerously close on the sofa.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(watching movie)}
<D>__{this is even better than suspiria. you've got decent taste in slasher movies, mark.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{here's to dovetailing interests.}
<A>__{he raises his mug in a toast and juno clinks it awkwardly.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{so, have you and vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, sort of. vanessa likes madison for a girl.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(aghast)}
<D>__{madison? isn't that kind of... i don't know, gay?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{god, pretentious much? i guess everyone should have a mysterious name like juno, huh?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{my dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with greek and roman mythology. he named me after zeus's wife. i mean, zeus had other lays, but i'm pretty sure juno was his only wife. she was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. like diana ross.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that suits you.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{uh, thanks.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i weighed my options. but after all this, i'm glad i didn't, you know, get rid of it. i want to have it. for you guys.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you're something else.}
<A>__{a door suddenly slams upstairs. vanessa's home.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{vanessa. shit, you better get out of here.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{why? what the big deal?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{nothing. she just hates when i sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i will handle this. i'm really good at diffusing mom type rage.}
<A>__{juno jumps up and rushes out.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{wait... aww, crap!}
