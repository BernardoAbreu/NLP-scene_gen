<L>__{ext moments later aokee's surf & snack shack}
<A>__{robbie, alex, aokee and pipeman have gathered in front of aokee's to strategize.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{so what you do? wait for him to go crazy and fall?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{don't want to win with him falling.}
<C>__{pipeman}
<D>__{you could always go out and do your very best, take a lot of chances and maybe win this thing on merit.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(dismissive)}
<D>__{don't be silly. that only works in the movies.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{actually, that's exactly what i'm thinking. it's the reason we're in a tie. i've been too conservative. i've got to do everything i can, or just forget about it. it's all or nothing.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we gotta pull the fin.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{pull da fin?}
<C>__{pipeman}
<D>__{you think you can hold it?}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(explaining)}
<D>__{one time, these tourists from japan on the beach at la jolla offered me a hundred bucks to do a full spin at the top of the wave, and then slide down and cut back and do a full back flip. i pulled it off. a friend of mine had a tricks board with just a single fin and foot pockets.}
<C>__{pipeman}
<D>__{we gotta pull the fin. what do we do about the foot pockets?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{you got duct tape?}
<A>__{pipeman reaches into his tool belt and pulls out a roll.}
<C>__{pipeman}
<D>__{what kind of plumber would i be if i didn't have duct tape? water world platinum! where do you want them?}
<A>__{they place the board on a table. robbie pulls off two small pieces of tape and places them on the board.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{here and here.}
<A>__{pipeman gets his screw gun out of his tool belt and begins removing the two outer fins of the board. he then begins looping duct tap around the board to create two foot pockets. this provides a background to the dialog below.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{so, help me understand. what you do now?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{pipeman is taking the extra fins off my board. i only need one to make a deep cut back. he is also putting some pockets to slip my feet into so when i flip upside down, i don't lose the board.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{flip upside down?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{a back flip. you guys see it on snowboarders here all the time, i'm sure.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{oh yeah, i'm sure i did that last winter. but not on purpose! dude. you're either gonna win this thing or you're gonna die.}
<C>__{aokee}
<P>__{(quickly, eagerly)}
<D>__{it would be better if you won.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{yeah, well, a tie is like kissing your sister.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(mock anger)}
<D>__{you stay away from my sister.}
<A>__{we hear an air horn blast. they are ready to start.}
<C>__{pipeman}
<D>__{ready!}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(to pipeman)}
<D>__{i will need the biggest wave you can give me...}
<C>__{pipeman}
<P>__{(imitating mr. scott on star trek)}
<D>__{i will give 'er all she's got, cap'n!}
<A>__{he hands robbie the board. alex heads back to the bleachers area, pipeman goes to the pumphouse in back of thunder bay. aokee hangs back with robbie and speaks to him alone.}
<C>__{aokee}
<P>__{(dropping his hawaiian accent)}
<D>__{robbie. when you do this, do this mostly for robbie zirpollo. but do it just a little bit for manny ramirez, eh?}
<A>__{aokee smiles and pats him on the back. robbie nods. they head for the bay.}
