<L>__{interior hotel day}
<A>__{pfefferberg at the front desk of a sleepy hotel with another black market middleman, the desk clerk. both are wearing their armbands. pfefferberg underlines figures on a little notepad of his own }
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{let's say this is what you give me. these are fees i have to pay some guys. this is my commission. this is what i bring you back in occupation currency.}
<A>__{the clerk, satisfied with the figures, is about to hand over to pfefferberg some outlawed polish notes from an envelope when schindler comes in from the street. the clerk puts the money away, gets schindler his room key, waits for him to leave so he can finish his business with pfefferberg... but schindler doesn't leave; he just keeps looking over at pfefferberg's shirt, at the cuffs, the collar.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{that's a nice shirt.}
<A>__{pfefferberg nods, yeah, thanks, and waits for schindler to leave; but he doesn't. nor does he appear to hear the short burst of muffled gunfire that erupts from somewhere up the street.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you don't know where i could find a shirt like that.}
<A>__{pfefferberg knows he should say 'no,' let that be the end of it. it's not wise doing business with a german who could have you arrested for no reason whatsoever. but there's something guileless about it.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{like this?}
<C>__{schindler}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{there's nothing in the stores.}
<A>__{the clerk tries to discourage pfefferberg from pursuing this transaction with just a look. pfefferberg ignores it.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{you have any idea what a shirt like this costs?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{nice things cost money.}
<A>__{the clerk tries to tell pfefferberg again with a look that this isn't smart.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i don't know, ten or twelve. that's a good color. dark blues, grays.}
<A>__{schindler takes out his money and begins peeling off bills, waiting for pfefferberg to nod when it's enough. he's being overcharged, and he knows it, but pfefferberg keeps pushing it, more. the look schindler gives him lets him know that he's trying to hustle a hustler, but that, in this instance at least, he'll let it go. he hands over the money and pfefferberg hands over his notepad.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{write down your measurements.}
<A>__{as he writes down the information, pfefferberg glances to the desk clerk and offers a shrug. as he writes }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i'm going to need some other things. as things come up.}
