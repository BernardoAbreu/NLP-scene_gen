<L>__{exterior elm street house}
<A>__{karen stands in front of a rotted gate in front of a run down building with shuttered windows and a crumbling foundation. this isn't just an elm street house, it's the elm street house. and for some reason karen is drawn to it. she looks to her let at the bent mailbox. it has a name plate on it. another one underneath it. and another. it's as if people moved in and out and instead of changing the plates on the mailbox, they just whacked a new one over the old. karen steps closer to the mailbox. the little sign on the top reads williams. she touches it with her finger and it drops off, the nails holding it on rusted away to dust. a new plate is revealed. this one says thompson. karen picks lightly at it, and it swings away. the name underneath makes karen gasp. it reads krueger. and there's still another one under that horrible name. karen quickly hits the krueger plate off. the last sign reads underwood. karen frowns. she turns back to the house, a determined expression on her face.}
