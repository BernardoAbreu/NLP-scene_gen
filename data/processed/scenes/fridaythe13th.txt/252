<A>__{alice is hiding in the shadows behind a table. we hear the sounds of the generator starting outside and suddenly three bright overhead lights come on. alice looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to reveal her hiding place. she looks for an escape. there's a window. she starts for it, then stops and turns and dives under an arts & crafts table. another angle: mrs. voorhees opens the door and walks in a few feet. she carries a machete in her hand. we see this instrument in cu as we hear over the sound of her son, jason, calling to her.}
