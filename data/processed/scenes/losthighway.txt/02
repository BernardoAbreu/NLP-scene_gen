<A>__{in the blackness, a man, fred, is sitting on a bed smoking a cigarette. we see his back, but with each glow of the cigarette ash, we see his face reflected in a mirror on the wall across from him. in the darkness, there starts the sound of a motor which draws curtains back across a large picture window just off screen. as the curtain moves, hard edged light begins crawling across the room, and we see everything clearly. fred is wearing a robe and pajamas, it's early morning. close up on fred's face in the mirror blank expression face somewhat obscured or distorted by smoke from the cigarette. close up 0n fred's actual face unshaven, haggard look, eyes seem empty, glazed over. fred is 32 years old, with dark hair. the doorbell rings. fred looks up, startled by the noise. he looks at the digital clock: 5:30 a.m. fred stands, goes to an intercom on the wall next to the mirror. he pushes a button. a voice comes over the intercom.}
