<A>__{drew slides down the slant of the roof. he hits the lattice and takes it to the ground with him. untangling himself, he gets to his feet... ...and here comes amanda, arriving home. drew runs for her car, waving his hands, throwing himself into her path so she'll go no further. she slams on the brakes. drew pulls open the passenger door and dives inside...}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{gus killed clyde, mom! he's trying to kill me!}
<A>__{just then, the back door flies open. gus steps out.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{drew, buddy! daddy's not done yet!}
<A>__{amanda spots the hammer hanging from his grip. gus cracks a sick smile and flings the hammer at the car... crack! the hammer bounces off the windshield, causing it to spiderweb.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{go mom! go!!!}
<A>__{that's all the convincing amanda needs. she puts the car into reverse and stomps on the gas...}
