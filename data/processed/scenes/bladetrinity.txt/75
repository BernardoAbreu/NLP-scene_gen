<A>__{we soar through the night sky, diving down towards a cluster of gleaming, high tech spires. as we isolate a penthouse apartment atop one of them we hear an angry scream.}
<C>__{danica }
<D>__{fucking hannibal king!}
<L>__{interior phoenix towers penthouse night}
<A>__{an impressively decorated loft bespeaking of money, power, and a certain perverse esthetic. danica slams her fist straight through the wall, then spins around, enraged. asher and grimwood are there too, their wounds being treated by hendrix and a vampire technician. at tie moment, they're trying to remove the arrow protruding from grimwood's eye. an enormous rottweiler sits nearby, attentively watching. a trio of guards flinch with every act of violence. danica is strong. clearly, no one wants to get in her way.}
<C>__{danica}
<D>__{i should've ripped his ripped his bleeding heart out when i had the chance!}
<P>__{(pointing at asher)}
<D>__{and don't you dare tell me "i told you so"!}
<A>__{asher raises his hands as if to say "no harm, no foul". danica continues her tantrum, smashing a statue apart, shattering a heavy glass tabletop. finally, she gives it a rest, collapsing into a chair, shoulders sagging.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{you through remodeling?}
<C>__{danica}
<D>__{blow me.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{face it, dan. we got caught with our pants down. we underestimated the nightstalkers.}
<C>__{grimwood}
<D>__{pants down?! they practically fucking ass raped us!}
<A>__{grimwood grunts in pain as the arrow is removed. asher broaches a more serious subject.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{has he been told yet?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{about your failure?}
<A>__{a man (30s) enters the room. the same being we glimpsed in the vault. he has a haunting gaze and a commanding presence. we will learn who he is momentarily. but for now, it's enough to know that everyone in the room pays him deference.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{yes, i've been told.}
<A>__{he places a hand on danica's shoulder. she tenses.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{perhaps it's time i entered the fray.}
