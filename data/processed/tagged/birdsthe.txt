<A>__{: full shot grant street san francisco day it is mid afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the people walking, the doorman hooting for taxicabs, the policemen directing traffic. pan shot pedestrians waiting at street corner for light to change. close shot man at the end of line of pedestrians. he is looking up at the sky. two shot man and woman next to him as she follows his gaze upward. long shot the sky with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling. med. shot the street corner as the light changes and people begin to cross. in the crowd walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling gulls in the sky overhead. the camera locates: med. shot melanie daniels in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching davidson's pet shop. she is a young woman in her mid twenties, sleekly groomed, exquisitely dressed, though hatless. she walks with the quick sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, a mischievous grin on her face. she continues toward the front door of a pet shop and enters.}

<A>__{melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back toward the street and skywards. the proprietor, a mrs. macgruder, comes toward her.}

<C>__{mrs. macgruder}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{there must be a storm at sea. that can drive them inland, you know.}
<A>__{they are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird department now. the barking of the dog segues into the clamor of innumerable birds, tweeting, twittering, cawing as melanie and mrs. macgruder go to the counter at the far end. there is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls are lined with wire mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained birds to be sure. the birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic birds, small splashes of color behind the wire mesh cages, larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets in the bigger cages. as they walk:}

<D>__{i know. oh, i know.}
<P>__{(she is more distressed now)}
<D>__{i've been calling all morning. oh, you have no idea. miss daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. we get them from india, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...}
<C>__{melanie}

<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{maybe it's the traffic. i will call. would you mind waiting?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(judiciously)}
<D>__{i think maybe you'd better deliver him. let me give you my address.}
<P>__{(she begins taking off her gloves)}
<C>__{mrs. macgruder}
<P>__{(producing pencil and pad)}
<D>__{oh. oh, well, all right.}

<C>__{mrs. macgruder}
<D>__{i'm sure they're on the way, though. could i just call?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(with a resigned sigh)}
<D>__{well, all right, but...}
<A>__{she scurries out behind the counter and out of sight. melanie finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the counter. she taps her teeth with the pencil.}

<P>__{(pause; accusingly)}
<D>__{it's past three, you know.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well, how long do you think...? all right, would you check it please? yes, i will wait.}
<A>__{melanie sighs. leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips with the pencil. there is no menace in the birds surrounding her. they are active and beautiful as they dart behind the bars and mesh of their cages. off screen, the puppy begins barking again as the front door opens. melanie looks up. med. shot mitch brenner as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the steps to the bird department. he is a handsome man, about twenty nine or thirty, well dressed, and carrying a felt hat. close shot melanie seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of strawberry finches. she pokes the pencil through the mesh. the birds are startled into scarlet flight. two shot melanie and mitch as they pass each other in the aisle. he gives a polite little nod, and she gives a polite little smile. but as he passes her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look and then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner. med. shot melanie looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of the cage and then comes face to face with mitch again.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{i wonder if you could help me.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(deliberately, and}
<D>__{with a touch of}
<P>__{hauteur)}
<D>__{i said i wonder if you could help me.}
<A>__{close shot melanie a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. she is about to inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. but then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea comes to her.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(solicitously)}
<D>__{yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?}
<A>__{two shot melanie and mitch}
<C>__{mitch}

<D>__{lovebirds.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{lovebirds, sir?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{yes. i understand there are different varieties, it that true?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{well... yes, sir, there are.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{these are for my sister... her birthday you see. as she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, i wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i understand completely, sir.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{as the same time, i wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(leading him around shop)}
<D>__{no, of course not.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{do you have a pair that are just friendly?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i think so, sir.}
<P>__{(she looks around)}
<D>__{now then, let me see.}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(at the finches)}
<D>__{aren't these lovebirds?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{no, sir, those are... redbirds.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{the sign says strawberry finches.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(airily)}
<D>__{yes, we call them that too.}
<P>__{(she moves away)}
<D>__{ahhh, here we are, lovebirds...}
<P>__{(and stops before a cage of canaries)}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{those are canaries, miss.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{doesn't this make you feel awful?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(baffled)}
<D>__{doesn't what make me...?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{all these innocent little creatures caged up like this?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{i suppose not. is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{oh, certainly. it's to protect the species.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{i imagine that's very important. especially during the moulting season.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{are they moulting now?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{some of them are.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{how can you tell?}

<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? we have some very nice canaries this week.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{all right.}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{she smiles back.}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(he waits)}
<D>__{all right, may i see one, please?}
<A>__{close shot melanie as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries out of the cage. she smiles feebly, glances toward the counter where she expects mrs. macgruder to reappear momentarily, and then takes a deep breath. she opens the door to the canary cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(feebly)}
<D>__{here, birdie. here, birdie, birdie.}
<A>__{one of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and into the room. melanie leaps back, startled.}

<D>__{what is it? oh! oh my, one of the birds is loose!}
<A>__{she joins in the chase around the room. the bird flutters up to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches them suspiciously.}
<C>__{mitch}

<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{well, i don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. it takes a while to get used to.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{where are you from originally, annie?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{san francisco.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{how'd you happen to come here?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.}
<A>__{there is an awkward pause. annie shrugs.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{look, i see no reason for being coy about this. it was mitch brenner.}
<A>__{melanie nods.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i guess you knew that, anyway.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i suspected as much.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you needn't worry. it's over and done with. a long time ago.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{annie there's nothing between mitch and me.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{isn't there?}
<P>__{(she shrugs)}
<D>__{maybe there isn't. maybe there's never anything between mitch and any girl.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i think i will have some of that, too.}
<P>__{(she pours brandy, drinks, sighs)}
<D>__{i was seeing quite a lot of him in san francisco, you know.}
<P>__{(she smiles weakly)}
<D>__{and then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet lydia.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{when was this?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{four years ago. of course, that was shortly after his father died. things may be different now.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{different?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{with lydia.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{did she seem a trifle distant?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{a trifle.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{then maybe it isn't different at all. you know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. i simply couldn't understand it.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{when i got back to san francisco i spent days trying to figure out just what i'd done to displease her.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{and what had you done?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{nothing! i simply existed. so what was the answer? a jealous woman, right? a clinging possessive mother.}
<P>__{(she shakes her head)}
<D>__{wrong. with all due respect to oedipus, i don't think that was the case at all.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{then what was it?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{lydia liked me, you see. that was the strange part of it. in fact, now that i'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{then why did she object to you?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{because she was afraid.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{afraid you'd take mitch?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{afraid i'd give mitch.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{afraid of any woman who'd give mitch the only thing lydia can give him love.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{no, i don't think so. she's not afraid of losing her son, you see. she's only afraid of being abandoned.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{she already has a daughter.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{what about mitch? didn't he have anything to say about this?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(apologetically)}
<D>__{i can understand his position. he went through a lot with lydia after his father died. he didn't want to risk going through it all over again.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{so it ended. not immediately, of course. i went back to san francisco, and i still saw mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{then what are you doing here in bodega bay?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you get straight to the point, don't you?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i'm sorry. forgive me.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{no, that's all right, i don't mind. i came up here for two reasons. to begin with, i was bored with my job in san francisco. i was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{then you know. little girls in brown beanies. deadly. here i have a life. i will go into that classroom on monday morning, and i will look out at twenty five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'yes, please give me what you have.'}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{and i will give them what i have. i haven't got very much, but i will give them every ounce of it. to me, that's very important. it makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.}
<P>__{(she sighs)}
<D>__{that's the first reason.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{and the second?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{i wanted to be near mitch.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it was over, and i knew it, but i wanted to be near him, anyway.}
<P>__{(she smiles)}
<D>__{you see, i still like him a hell of a lot. that's rare, i think. i don't want to lose his friendship... ever.}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence. into the silence, the telephone shrills. annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer it. close shot annie at the phone.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{hello? oh, hello. no, no, i wasn't asleep. what is it?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{yes, just a little while ago. sure, hold on.}
<P>__{(she turns to melanie)}
<D>__{it's mitch. for you.}
<A>__{two shot melanie and annie as they stare at each other across the room, melanie hesitating.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{he's waiting.}
<A>__{melanie rises and goes to the phone. the camera follows annie to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her throughout following, recording her reactions as melanie talks to mitch in the background. annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally and irrevocably be losing mitch to another girl.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(at phone; coolly)}
<D>__{hello? yes, this is melanie. fine, thank you. no, no trouble at all. i simply followed the road. it's a very bright night.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what? oh. well, there's no need to apologize. i can understand...}
<P>__{(pause; she listens)}
<D>__{well...}
<P>__{(she listens again)}
<D>__{that's very kind of you. no, i'm not angry.}
<P>__{(she listens)}
<D>__{i couldn't. i'm afraid i have to get back to san francisco.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no, i wouldn't want to disappoint cathy, but...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i see.}
<P>__{(she is warming)}
<D>__{i see. well, if you really...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{all right. yes, i will be there.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{good night, mitch.}

<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i said i would.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i will be going, too, to help out. it should be fun, melanie.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{it seems so pointless.}
<P>__{(she sighs)}
<D>__{i think i will go to sleep. this has been a busy day.}
<P>__{(picking up her paper bag)}
<D>__{my luggage.}
<A>__{she smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to annie.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{pretty. did you get that at brinkmeyer's?}
<A>__{melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. she is silent for a moment, pensive. then:}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{do you think i should go?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{that's up to you.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{it's really up to lydia, isn't it?}

<D>__{never mind lydia. do you want to go?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{then go.}

<D>__{thank you, annie.}

<P>__{(no answer)}
