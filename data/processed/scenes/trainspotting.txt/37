<D>__{but begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash. he's got a hangover so bad he can hardly hold the fucking cue, never mind pot the ball. i'm doing my best to lose, trying to humour him, like, but it's not doing any good: every time i touch the ball i pot something, every time begbie goes near the table he fucks it up. so he's got the hump, right, but finally i manage to set it up so all he's go to do is pot the black to win one game and salvage a little pride and maybe not kick my head in, right. so he's on the black, pressure shot, and it all goes wrong, big time. what does he do? picks on this specky wee gadge at the bar and accuses him of putting him off by looking at him. can you believe it? i mean, the poor cunt hasn't even glanced in our direction. he's sitting there quiet as a mouse when beggars gubs him with the cue. he was going to chib him, i tell you, then i thought he was going to do me. the beggar is fucking psycho, but he's a mate, you know, so what can you do?}
<A>__{the events are as follows: begbie and tommy are playing pool. begbie, furious, miscues, goes in off, etc. tommy deliberately misses sitters and tries to look annoyed. begbie lines up to play the black. it is unmissable. at the bar beyond sits a harmless young man, wearing the same clothes as the hard man in begbie's account except that they are now baggy rather than taut. he is clearly not staring at begbie but drinks a half pint and eats some crisps. as begbie plays, the man bites a crisp. begbie miscues, rips the cloth and the ball flies off the table. tommy catches it and looks up to see begbie assaulting the young man. tommy cautiously restrains begbie and he reaches into his jacket for a knife. begbie turns and for a moment looks as though he might attack tommy.}
