<L>__{interior parlor later}
<A>__{in the far corner of the room, bunny plays with warren, a sweet, ugly dog. toothless and, undeniably, blue.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{i never knew her, really.}
<A>__{see him now, sipping his tea. wallowing in the detritus of his emotions.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{but she was driven by terrible forces, no one could understand. she was a locked door. even to me.}
<A>__{agnis in the good chair. teacup on her ample lap. assessing a photo on the end table, petal's arctic eyes, rigidly seductive pose. the snapshot enshrined by a neighboring votive rose in its jelly jar glass.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{so she wasn't just a bitch in high heels?}
<A>__{quoyle's eyes cut instinctively toward his daughter, her innocence protected by distance and absorption with warren's passivity.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{don't stress. she mighta heard worse from her momma. i'm only guessin'.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{some people probably thought petal was bad clear through.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{people. are a cynical lot.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{i think she just couldn't get enough love.}
<A>__{agnis' unblinking eyes.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{i think the evidence. is on your side.}
<A>__{the eyes study him. dissect him, even.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{i'm headed north, nephew, to where our family comes from, in newfoundland. thought i'd never go back. but the older y'get...}
<A>__{clucks her tongue.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{there's a pull. becomes an ache. as if where your people started held a purpose for you. like you're a piece in a puzzle...}
<A>__{not a smile. but something. a softening of timbre, a flicker behind the eye.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{...lookin' for where y'fit.}
<A>__{lifts her cup.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{you, too.}
<A>__{takes a sip. his eyes have narrowed in a burlesque of suspicion.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{in what sense do you m...}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{you need to come, nephew.}
<A>__{just like that.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{nothin' here but hurt. you got to start fresh, everythin's gone!}
<A>__{hmmn?}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{the trip'll clear your head. be educational for the squirt. teach ya the world's still spinnin' outside this toxic slice o'hades. and who knows...?}
<A>__{tilts her head. who knows.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{they must have a newspaper up there. somebody's gotta write it.}
<A>__{he just stares. the blankest of the blank.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{tell the truth, i'd appreciate the company. you two are pretty much my family.}
<A>__{his face softens. hadn't thought of it that way. and seeing this...}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{a pot o'coffee would hit the spot. drop o'whiskey would fit nice in it.}
<A>__{she waits. he rises. and when he does...}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{which one's my brother?}
<A>__{he blinks. she looks at two urns on the mantle.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{uh. there's mom. and that's poppa.}
<A>__{the name of the funeral home tastefully stenciled. he clears his throat...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{those are temporary.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{coffee. and maybe a sweet.}
<A>__{quoyle nods, glad to serve. heads off to the kitchen. agnis looks at bunny and warren.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{she needs to go outside.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{i know why.}
<A>__{she runs out, the dog trotting after. alone now... ...agnis pulls something from her large carpetbag purse. it is an oversized ziploc bag. she stands. crosses to... ...her brother's urn. she removes the lid. turns the huge ziploc upside down to cover the urn. then, in one deft movement... ...upends the urn, a cascade of ash tumbling into the ziploc. seals it. sets it to one side. then, from her purse... ...another ziploc already filled with replacement ashes. she pours just enough into the urn. that should do it. stashes the rest back in her purse. turns now to lift... ...the ziploc with her brother's remains. stares at it. think hamlet with yorrick's skull.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{what say, guy? the dumpster?}
<A>__{a beat. eyes flat and neutral.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{just a thought.}
