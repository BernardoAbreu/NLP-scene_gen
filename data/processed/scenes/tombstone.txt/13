<L>__{ext oriental saloon day}
<A>__{we feel the sensual delight of going from hot sun into cool dark as wyatt enters, going up to the ornate mahogany bar. though a large, handsome saloon complete with gaming tables, it has only a few patrons on hand. "the lilly and the rose" is on the player piano as bartender milt joyce appears:}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{what can i get you?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{let me have one of those cigars.}
<P>__{(lights up, looks around)}
<D>__{kinda nice in here. you run it?}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{milt joyce, owner operator.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{well, excuse me for askin', milt, but isn't it kinda dead in here?}
<A>__{joyce points to the faro table in the corner where johnny tyler, an unshaven plug ugly with a big d.a. colt .45 carried ostentatiously in a shoulder holster, deals to a couple of scruffy looking drifters.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{you see that bird at the faro table? that's johnny tyler. he barged in here one day, said he was takin' over the game, started slappin' customer, wavin' his gun around, scarin' off all the high class play. only trade comes in here now's just bummers and drovers, just the dregs.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{why don't you get rid of him and get yourself straight dealer?}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{well sure, neighbor, easy to say.}
