<L>__{exterior taj mahal. day.}
<A>__{jamal and salim wander under the great dome of the taj mahal. two tiny slum kids dwarfed by this massive monument to love. it is a moment of genuine wonderment for them. then a tour guide bustles nearby, tourists flowing behind him.}
<C>__{guide}
<D>__{...there are five main elements to the taj. the darwaza, the main gateway, the bageecha or garden, the masjid or mosque, the naqqar khana, the rest house and the rauza or mausoleum. if you would like to follow me, i will show you the ninety nine names of allah on mumtaz's tomb. as before, please remove your shoes.}
<A>__{jamal follows the guide and his entourage into the mausoleum. salim meanwhile is studying the line of shoes. tries a smart pair of women's court shoes, before slipping a foot into a nice, white sneaker. a smile crosses his face. his other foot quickly follows and he saunters away, all mock innocence.}
