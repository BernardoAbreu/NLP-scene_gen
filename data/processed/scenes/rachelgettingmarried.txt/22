<L>__{interior basement. day.}
<A>__{kym and kieran, having sex in the cavernous basement. it runs practically the length of the house and there are nooks and caves everywhere. an ancient sofa, riddled with cigarette burns, some futons, dragged down and thrown haphazardly in corners, unicorn posters hideously and pornographically defaced, and squat jars of ancient household products (oil of olay, self tanner) filled with cigarette butts offer proof of years of inhabitation. later kym lights up.}

<D>__{well, that was so wrong }
<C>__{kym}

<C>__{kym}
<D>__{it is kind of lurid, isn't it? the best man and the maid of honor... furtively slipping off to the coal bin to have it off while the rest of the wedding party labors away at preparations for the big event.}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{i thought...isn't emma going to be playing that role?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kieran}
