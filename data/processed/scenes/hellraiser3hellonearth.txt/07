<L>__{interior hospital corridor night}
<A>__{joey makes her solitary way along a medium length corridor that has two sets of double swing doors at either end, one set giving on to the er, the other toward an exit. joey is heading for the latter, her mood sad and defeated.}
<B>__{angle on exit doors}
<A>__{suddenly smash! the doors burst open from the other side.}
<B>__{angle on corridor}
<A>__{the mood is suddenly fast and urgent as a gurney is wheeled rapidly through the doors. two paramedics, both male, both about joey's age, are pushing the gurney at a run and talking rapidly to each other. they completely ignore joey and also ignore the teenage girl who is running beside the gurney. the girl terri is 18 or 19. she is a pale faced blonde dressed as if for a desperately seeking susan party and is keeping up a stream of chatter as if rehearsing excuses. as joey flattens herself against the corridor wall to let them pass, it is neither the paramedics nor terri that get her attention. it is the boy on the gurney. angle on gurney boy the teenage boy lies flat on his back semi conscious, his eyelids fluttering, his breathing shallow. horribly, shockingly, dangling from his face and body are long, heavy chains that drag and rattle along the corridor floor. there are at least sixteen of them and they seem firmly buried in his skin.}
<B>__{angle on corridor}
<A>__{the dialogue as the gurney is rushed to the er doors is rapid fire and overlapped, the paramedics responding only to each other and ignoring the two girls comments and questions.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{it wasn't my fault. it wasn't my fault.}
<C>__{paramedic 1}
<D>__{10 milligram iv valium stat. how the fuck did this happen ... ?!}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{it was outside. i wasn't even with him.}
<C>__{paramedic 2}
<D>__{you ever see anything like this before?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{he must have stolen it.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{paramedic 1}
<D>__{yeah, sure. five times a fucking day. just push!}
<A>__{once the gurney has passed her, joey runs along behind it.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{it was off the statue. in the club.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{what happened to him?}
<C>__{paramedic 2}
<D>__{think they'll get him back?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{it's nothing to do with me.}
<C>__{paramedic 1}
<D>__{worst case of status i've seen. even money at best.}
<A>__{the foot of the gurney slams into the er doors and the paramedics slide it rapidly through.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{wait! i'm a reporter! tell me where he was ...}
<B>__{angle on er through doors}
<A>__{the nurse and a middle aged doctor are seen through the doors preparing emergency equipment. the doctor already has fibrillator pads in his hands. the paramedics follow the gurney through and, turning rapidly, push the doors closed from the inside.}
<B>__{angle on corridor}
<A>__{joey and terri are alone, excluded from the er activity. joey turns to speak but terri is already halfway to the other doors. joey runs after her.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{hold on. hold on, please. i need talk to you.}
<C>__{terri}
<P>__{(over her shoulder)}
<D>__{it's nothing to do with me. i wasn't even with him.}
<A>__{joey catches up with her a couple of yards short of the doors. she grabs at her arm to slow her down. terri turns, snatching her arm away in a sudden moment of fierce anger. she backs toward the doors, making gestures of dismissal and denial with her hands.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{look, lady! i told you! it's not my problem! i was just there!}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{under the underground. can i like go now?!}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{under the underground? what's that? where is ...}
<A>__{suddenly, the conversation is interrupted by a shatteringly loud scream, agonized and terrified, coming from the er. both girls freeze but then their reactions are very different: joey turns instantly and runs back toward the er. terri watches her for a beat and then heads through the other doors. the scream continues, a howling horrible sound. joey reaches the er doors and throws them open. and freezes in terrified shock.}
