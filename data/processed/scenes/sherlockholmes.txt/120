<L>__{interior hospital room}
<A>__{we see a newspaper on the nightstand next to a hospital bed, the headline reads: "american ambassador standish burned alive!" watson is burned, cut, bruised, scraped, pock marked with shrapnel. he mumbles inaudibly, his eyes still closed. he's delirious, sweating. (note: mary's detective novels and magazines, coat, handbag, etc. already in the room.) the doctor injects watson in the arm. the shot wakes him. watson tries to sit up, wincing with pain.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{what are you administering?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{morphia. a sixth of a grain, for the pain.}
<A>__{watson looks at his wounded shoulder.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{there are four pieces of shrapnel. the surgeon should be along shortly.}
<A>__{watson tries to sit up again. this reveals that mary has entered the room, stands back respectfully, letting the doctor do his work.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{are they subcutaneous, or deeper?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{they're near the carotid artery.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{get a mirror, i will extract them myself.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i can't authorize that, doctor. we must first manage the pain and combat the infection.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i haven't time for that. my friend is in dire }
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{your friend? what kind of friend takes a retired soldier, who's served his country and deserves a peaceful, private life, and puts him so directly in harm's }
<A>__{watson grabs the doctor's arm angrily.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{the best and wisest man i've ever known.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{but evidently not wise enough to value your life over his misadventures.}
<B>__{on mary}
<A>__{as she takes a closer, sharper look at the doctor.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(succumbing to the morphine)}
<D>__{it was worth a wound, worth many wounds...}
<A>__{mary steps towards the doctor, eyes flashing.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{excuse me }
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(leaving)}
<D>__{i have other... patients.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{do you really? doctor.}
<A>__{the doctor turns just outside the door, to face her. she's suddenly very angry.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you have nothing more to say to me?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{um... i will check in on him again shortly.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{is that the best you can do? i'm disappointed, but not surprised.}
<A>__{the doctor has no words.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{if anything happens to him, both our lives are lost. do you understand that? can you? }
<A>__{the doctor can't face her anger any longer, turns, leaves fast.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{ or are you so selfish that's just not possible.}
