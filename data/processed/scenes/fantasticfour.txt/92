<A>__{angles of reed in the lab, grabbing their space uniforms from various closets containers:}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{our uniforms were exposed to the storm like us. so they can transform like us, becoming invisible, changing size on demand or remaining impervious to flame.}
<A>__{reveal: reed, sue, and johnny step out to look at themselves in a mirror wearing the uniforms. no boots, no gloves. not yet. (the uniforms will develop, like our heroes).}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you look like an eighties rock band.}
<C>__{sue}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{the suit will stretch. you should try it }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i wouldn't be caught dead in that.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{he's right. these costumes are... missing something. i can't put my finger on it }
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{they're not costumes.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{we're not taking them out. johnny, we need to stay here till we've stabilized.}
<A>__{johnny shakes his head, frustrated.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{i'm getting sick of being trapped here. nasa wasn't even this strict!}
<A>__{he marches out. sue turns to reed, who says nothing. sue heads out, leaving ben and reed. a beat. ben looks at reed.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(looking at uniform)}
<D>__{maybe it's missing a utility belt.}
<A>__{off reed's dark look, we hear:}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{so what's the prognosis?}
