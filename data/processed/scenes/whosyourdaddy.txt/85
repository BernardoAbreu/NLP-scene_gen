<A>__{uncle billy chortles, his image glowing on a large flat screen monitor that hangs on the wall. ted leans back in his chair.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{i can't wait to see the pictures.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it was incredible. the light, the crowd, everything.}
<A>__{uncle billy grins proudly at ted.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{such enthusiasm. have i told you lately how proud i am of you?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{seriously? i'm doing all right?}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{you're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. you're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you.}
<A>__{ted knows it's not true. he looks guilty.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i owe it all to you. without your help i'd be lost.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{i wish i knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. i wish he never gave you up.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah, well, like my grandpa used to say...you can't change your christmas past, but you sure can exchange your christmas presents.}
<A>__{uncle billy forces a laugh.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{why don't you come to town this weekend? we could play some golf, chase some skirts.}
<A>__{ted smiles at the appealing offer.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'd love to, but i really need to crack the books. final exams are coming up and i've been slacking.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{you're right. i should work, too. our first issue together is almost ready to printerior}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{thanks, uncle billy. thanks for everything.}
<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{you're a great kid. don't you forget it.}
<A>__{with that, he's gone. the room is completely silent. and ted is completely alone. until the doorbell chimes. ted's luxurious hotel suite entry way night ted opens the door. it's jimmy, with his shiny new bike.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{james, what are you doing here?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you can call me jimmy again. sheryl petersen said james sounds too pretentious.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{sheryl petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{she knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's really late...do your parents know where you are?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{mom and dad think i'm tucked safely in bed and that's all they need to know. will this discussion be continuing in the hallway, or somewhere slightly more inviting?}
<A>__{ted's luxurious hotel suite living room jimmy seems impressed by the opulence. he takes off his bike helmet, looks around.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{impressive. this is bigger than our whole house.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{most places are, jimmy.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{they say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{so, what brings you here at his hour?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{my new bike.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{very funny.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i came to ask permission to take custody of your room.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{my room?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{better view, more spacious, new carpet. it's a no brainer.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's not up to me.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{mom and dad said it's yours. they seem to think you're coming home.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you can have it, then. i'm not going back there.}
<A>__{jimmy whips out a piece of paper from his pocket.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{if you could just sign right there.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you want it in writing?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{just a formality.}
<A>__{ted signs. jimmy squirrels away the paper, excitedly. starts to zip up his wind breaker.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's it? i mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? we could play games and watch movies and stuff.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{are you kidding? mom and dad discover i'm gone and i will be doing hard time.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{are they okay?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{aside from the fact that mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i miss them, too.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you can't come back. that is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you're a peach.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{funny you should say that. my grandfather was a peach farmer.}
<A>__{ouch. for the first time, that really smarts.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{he was my grandfather, too.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i meant biologically.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's a crappy thing to say.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{look ted. i'm cool with everything. you've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. you've always had an itch for the good life. i'm happy for you. this couldn't happen to a nicer guy.}
<A>__{ted listens.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{but just for the record, my mom is a kick ass schoolteacher and my dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the himalayas. you seem to have forgotten they opened nelson's family market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. their kids.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i didn't forget.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. got it?}
<A>__{ted's stunned. talk about tough love.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{loud and clear.}
<A>__{suddenly the phone rings. ted sheepishly explains...}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{that's probably my office.}
