<A>__{the brightly lit, restricted, inner corridor of spectrum stadium (interior night) where wheeler walks beside bob seidman, with walter kenton and kenneth killcoyne just behind. sounds of the game still in progress can be heard, but far away. occasionally the lawyers are passed by food service or laundry}
<B>__{service employees...}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. did any of them know andy was sick?}
<A>__{how did they know? did he tell them?}
<D>__{did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? none of this information got to the managing partners. we know that. make sure everyone else does too... and beckett: i want to know everything about his personal life. did he frequent those pathetic bars on camac street?}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<P>__{(ignoring seidman)}
<D>__{what about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{charles...}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{what deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?}
<P>__{(with irritation)}
<D>__{what is it, bob?!}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{let's settle with andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.}
<A>__{they arrive at a quiet, semi private cul de sac.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{andrew brought aids into our offices, into our men's room. he brought aids to our annual goddamn family picnic.}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{we ought to be suing him.}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{for christ's sake, where's your compassion?}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{compassion? andy sucks cocks, bob. he takes it up the ass. he's a pervert.}
<A>__{only seidman shows any kind of reaction.}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{that's kind of... extreme, walt. andy's private life is none of our business.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{bob. you're trying my patience. andrew beckett is making his private life our business. we gave him kronos. did he say, "i'm sick. i might not be able to see this through?"}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{he was doing a great job.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{bob. i must ask you to shut the fuck up. did andrew beckett say "i might not be able to serve our clients to the best of my ability ?" he said nothing. and now, andrew beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, philadelphia, judicial establishment. my god.}
<C>__{killcoyne}
<D>__{beckett doesn't want to go to court, he's hoping for a quick tasty settlement.}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{a jury might decide that andy has a case.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{wait a minute. the man was fired for incompetence, not because he has aids. you didn't know he was sick, did you, bob?}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{holy shit. did you, bob?}
<C>__{seidman}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{no. not really.}
<A>__{wheeler walks away, followed by kenton and killcoyne. bob seidman stands alone in this dark place.}
<B>__{city sounds}
