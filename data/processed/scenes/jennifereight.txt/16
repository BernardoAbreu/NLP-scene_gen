<A>__{ross has a vic inhaler up his nostril. an inadequate defense. a sudden stink slams into his neck muscles. head and inhaler travel rearward. he shifts eyes to berlin who scans the bum's autopsy reports. a pathologist comments on his handiwork into a microphone hanging from the ceiling. "except as previously noted, the liver is not remarkable." ross doesn't believe it.}

<C>__{ross}
<D>__{frozen? .. i've no idea ..}
