<A>__{ave and willcox hillyer as the young stewardess gives them drinks. dave bestows a sour glance on her when he sees the single drink, but at the moment he is in the midst of an aggressively self satisfied conversation and says nothing to her. he speaks to hillyer, who is making a real effort to be polite but is less than happy about the encounter.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<D>__{well, i am in the construction business, buddy, and without braggin' i have done real good at it.}
<P>__{(with a meaningful bitterness)}
<D>__{there are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.}
<P>__{(pauses as if waiting for}
<D>__{a reaction, but hillyer}
<P>__{is very silent)}
<D>__{right now i'm buildin' a giant motel unit near alexandria, outside washington, d.c. not fi nance, i'm on the construction side.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(making polite talk)}
<D>__{well, that's interesting, dave. i always liked washington, it's a pretty town.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<D>__{oh, it's all right, beats jew york. but the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.}
<A>__{hillyer gives a barely perceptible wince at this speech, but dave doesn't notice, he goes on with aggressive self satisfaction after a swallow of whiskey.}
<C>__{dave wilkie }
<D>__{but i have done real good in the construction field. what i don't know about buildin' ain't worth knowin'. i knocked off twenty eight thousand smackeroos last year, how's that for an old country boy?}
<A>__{dave pauses, realizes this might not impress; glances down with curiosity at the galley sheets, then an unpleasant smile.}
<C>__{dave wilkie }
<D>__{ha ha, course you make a lot more.}
<P>__{(points at the galleys)}
<D>__{what's that you got there, buddy?}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{galley proof.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<D>__{galley what?}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{page proof of a book i'm working on.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<D>__{how about that. well, you always were a screwball.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(lifts an eyebrow in mild irony)}
<D>__{oh, yeah?}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<P>__{(unfazed)}
<D>__{i don't mean that the way it sounds.}
<P>__{(stares at galleys as if rattlesnake)}
<D>__{imagine it, a book. and i used to know you personal way back when.}
<P>__{(pauses, then earnestly)}
<D>__{tell me something, buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(absolutely straight)}
<D>__{well, actually, we have a little black boy named her t who lives in the garage. he does it for me.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<P>__{(for a moment half}
<D>__{believes it, then a slow,}
<P>__{stupid grin)}
<D>__{heh heh heh heh, same old buddy, always jokin' around. almost as much of a joker as your daddy.}
<P>__{(drains his drink,}
<D>__{grimaces; a heavy}
<P>__{drinker, dave)}
<D>__{i saw your daddy a coupla years ago, i was up in glenville lookin' at a motel site. i guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(stares out of plane window)}
<D>__{that's right, dave, i'm headed for glenville on a whisperin' jet.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<P>__{(suddenly calls out)}
<D>__{hey, girl! hey, you, give us another drink!}
<P>__{(to hillyer, sullenly)}
<D>__{dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place.}
<A>__{willcox hillyer listens with a pained half smile, a hand at his temple.}
<C>__{dave wilkie }
<D>__{this friggin' airline's out of its mind.}
<P>__{(a martyr)}
<D>__{the sons of bitches tried to put me in tourist.}
<P>__{(portentuously philosophical)}
<D>__{but our whole civilization is screwed up, buddy. the heebies and the coconuts have took it over and ruined it.}
<A>__{willcox hillyer half closes his eyes in weariness, but says nothing. gently, he rubs his temple. it is plain dave wilkie gives him a headache.}
