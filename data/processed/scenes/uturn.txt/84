<A>__{bobby turns the mustang up the drive. the headlights cut the darkness and land on an empty patch where grace's jeep had been parked. bobby jumps from the mustang and runs around frantically. his look is devastated. he falls to his knees, about to sob when: grace opens the front door and pokes her head out, putting out several suitcases.}
