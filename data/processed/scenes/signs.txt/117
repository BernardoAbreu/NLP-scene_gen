<A>__{graham enters his front hall. he closes the door and locks it behind him. he turns and looks into the family room. morgan and bo and merrill are seated together on the sofa. all three are wearing foil helmets. beat.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{they're skin changes color. that's why we couldn't see him that night.}
<A>__{graham stares at his family huddled on the couch. beat. graham takes in the news as he moves to the stairs. he takes a seat on the second to last step. he sits obscured by the balusters. beat.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{tell me something morgan. in that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{yes. they would invade us using only ground tactics. hand to hand combat. they wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{i'm sorry, what book is this?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{they said one of two things could happen. one, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{what's two?}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{they win.}
<A>__{the words hang in the air. graham sits quietly on the second step of the stairs.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{what do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{sounds made up.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{we can choose to believe it and pack up and leave.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{or we can stay here. board up this house. hide inside our home and wait it out. either way, at least we'll be together.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{all those in favor of the lake, raise your hand.}
<A>__{no one raises their hand.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{all those in favor of home, raise your hand.}
<A>__{all four put their hands in the air. beat. they lower them and sit in silence.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{how do we know boards will do anything?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{because, they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.}
