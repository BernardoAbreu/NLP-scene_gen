<L>__{interior dwight and caroline's bedroom night}
<A>__{dwight and caroline lie on the bed, kissing passionately. it is clear that caroline is as excited as dwight.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i know you may think this is silly, dwight, but it seems like... i don't know, like an emblem or something. i want to be able to see your face when we make love. how else can we be cl }
<A>__{the rest of the word is jerked out of her as dwight turns her onto her side, away from him, and proceeds to make love again in his favorite manner.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{you just don't know what's good, sugar. you're too tense. you just relax and dwight'll take you on a little trip. okay? you'll have a good time.}
<A>__{caroline closes her eyes. same scene hours later dwight leans back against the headboard of the bed. caroline sits between his legs, her back against his chest. with one hand, dwight strokes caroline's hair. the other hand is curled around her throat.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{... are the prettiest thing i've ever seen. i mean it. you are. the way your hair curls up right there. so pretty. i just love you so much. i don't know what i'd do if you ever left me. i couldn't take it.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{guy i knew in the navy had a saying: 'if you love her, here's what to do: let her go visit places new. if she loves you, she'll come back to you. if she don't come back... hunt the bitch down and kill her.'}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{that's awful, i guess. i don't feel that way, but close. my pretty thing...}
<A>__{we see that caroline realizes the enormity of her mistake.}
