<A>__{riker and troi react to the diagram as the borg dots begin moving away from engineering. it looks like the swarm of ants have left the candy bar and are on the ground, moving toward the forward part of the ship.}
<C>__{troi}
<D>__{they're bypassing engineering...}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{where the hell are they going?}

<A>__{close on data's face. his eyes are closed he is in the android equivalent of sleep. camera rotating and pushing in on his face as we hear the overlapping sounds of voices from data's past picard, riker, troi, the enterprise crew, aliens he's met, data's own voice... bits and pieces of his life... the theme of the sound bites should be data's quest for humanity: picard giving him advice, troi counseling him, soong talking to his son, etc. the last line of dialogue we hear is data saying "i want to be more human."}
<C>__{borg queen's voice}
<D>__{data...}
<A>__{data's eyes fly open, now awake. we pull back revealing that data is still strapped to the borg operating table... his right arm and shoulder are encased in some kind of strange cybernetic shell, obscured from view. clear tubes run out of the shell into borg machinery liquid is coursing through the tubes. a couple of borg drones are moving about the room, carrying out various tasks. there's been a change since we've been here last. there are now several plexiglass cylinders surrounding data's table each of them filled with some kind of murky red fluid, which is swirling around. every once in awhile, something that looks like raw flesh bumps up against the clear plexiglass, then disappears again. we don't know what these tubes are for, but they're definitely creepy. data takes all this in, but there is nothing he can do, he's still immobilized. suddenly the table rotates and begins to move up toward the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling. it stops a few feet away... and data finds himself face to face with the borg queen again.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{you've taken your first step toward perfection. how does it feel?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i do not know what you are referring to.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{that's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.}
<A>__{a whoosh of hydraulic power signals another movement by the borg queen. she slithers through the air and down slightly, so that she is on the same level as data. she looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing data's right arm, which opens at her silent command and moves away... we can now see that all of the skin has been removed from data's right arm, showing the inner workings of his android limb circuitry and servos, etc. but on the top of the mechanical forearm there is something new a small patch of human flesh held in place with various nasty looking hooks and clamps and small tubes carrying blood. it's a delicate, fragile piece of organic life on an ugly, mechanical surface. data looks down at the patch of flesh with a little puzzlement.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<P>__{(re: flesh)}
<D>__{do you know what this is, data?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{it would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo skeletal structure.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{what a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.}
<A>__{she smiles slightly, utterly confident. she leans her face in close to data's still immobilized right arm.}
