<D>__{that's right. air and water. terriforming will create a permanent livable environment for mars. no more pressurized cities, no more containers in the desert. there'll be rivers, vegetation life the same as earth.}

<D>__{don't you see?! from being a pile of red dirt with minerals, mars is going to change into a chunk of priceless real estate.}

<D>__{and cohaagen's going to own it all!}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{right! he can start selling it off to well heeled investors from earth. beach condos, ski resorts, you name it.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{no wonder he wanted you to... penetrate... out group.}
