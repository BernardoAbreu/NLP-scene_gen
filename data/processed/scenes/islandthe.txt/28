<L>__{interior. foyer community center evening}
<A>__{the music from within is like a warm beckoning hand. the foyer is slightly vaulted to accommodate a statue. on a bench at its f o o t , ester sits alone, waiting patiently. as lincoln enters, s h e rises to greet him, smiling. he seems more sullen than usual.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{s o r r y i'm late.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{i t ' s okay. i was waiting to tell you something anyway. guess what?}
<A>__{lincoln looks at her, unsettled by her flourishing smile.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{m y baby i felt it move. and it's the weirdest feeling too. i can't explain it. it's like being more... more h e r e .}
<A>__{lincoln returns a deadpan look. ester's smile wavers a little.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm all excited and we're supposed to be finding peace of mind.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i have to cancel, ester.}
<A>__{his voice is expressionless. ester shrugs, refreshing her smile.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{s o i will see you at breakfast tomorrow?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{ester ' s smile falls. her eyes, reaching, trying to understand.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{did i do something wrong, lincoln?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{a small word but it comes heavily. before ester can ask another question, lincoln turns and leaves. his jaw, clenching with the effort of self containment. ester watches him, not hurt, just a little confused. we widen to encompass the height of the statue. the likeness is idealized but unmistakably that of dr. sanger.}
