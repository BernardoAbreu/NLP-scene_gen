<L>__{interior anya's bedroom in tatiana's house night}
<A>__{anya snuggles down into the thick covers as tatiana strokes her hair gently.}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{... and that christmas dinner, when cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! i do remember so much now, grandmama, but not everything.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...}
<A>__{anya closes her eyes as tatiana continues to stroke her hair.}
<C>__{tatiana }
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{my poor child you're safe, now... you're home ...}
<A>__{anya is asleep as tatiana kisses her forehead, turns off the light and walks to the door. she looks back on her sleeping granddaughter with enormous joy and gratitude. she smiles to herself as she pulls the door closed behind her, revealing rasputin standing behind the door. his eyes glow like embers in the dark. bartok is perched on his shoulder.}
<C>__{rasputin}
<D>__{yesss ... finally "home". and what a charming ... girlish little home it is.}
<P>__{(gestures to cherubs in the wallpaper)}
<D>__{look, bartok, little angels, the symbol of ... love. so sweet, so harmless.}
<A>__{rasputin takes the reliquary from around his waist and places it on the table.}
<C>__{rasputin }
<D>__{let's go for a touch of irony, shall we?}
<A>__{he waves his hand and the smoke emerges, emanating toward the walls.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{some cherubs as the smoke hits them. they begin to change, taking on a lean and evil look. their tiny arrows grow, becoming lethal, as their eyes turn from soft brown to blood red. slowly, they emerge from the wallpaper, their small wings growing into horrible pterodactyl membranous paired appendages. they swoop into flight and begin to circle the room, faster and faster. rasputin leans precariously over the sleeping anya, chuckling.}
<C>__{rasputin }
<D>__{and there will be no blood on my hands ...}
<A>__{rasputin backs away as the cherubs aim their jagged arrows at anya. suddenly, meetoo leaps up from the bed, barking. rasputin, startled, jumps backward. bartok falls off his shoulder and on to the table, knocking into the reliquary which is about to fall.}
<C>__{rasputin }
<D>__{nooooooo!}
<A>__{rasputin catches it. the spell is immediately broken and everything turns back to normal just as anya wakes up. she sees rasputin and lets out a scream. rasputin advances on her, his hands outstretched as if to strangle her when he hears footsteps and voices in the hallway. rasputin grabs the reliquary and leaps out the window, his monk's robe billowing just as the door opens. tatiana rushes in and sees bartok flying out the window.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{anastasia! it was just a bat! it's gone, dear...}
<C>__{anya}
<P>__{(shaken)}
<D>__{no, it wasn't a bat! i saw this horrible man i remember him, i think...}
<C>__{tatiana}
<P>__{(comforting)}
<D>__{no, no child... shush... it's all right ...}
<A>__{she embraces anya, who is still terrified and knows that she saw what she saw.}
