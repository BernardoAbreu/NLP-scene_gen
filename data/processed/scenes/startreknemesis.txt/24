<L>__{interior enterprise crew lounge night}
<A>__{riker and deanna are having dinner with worf.}
<C>__{deanna}
<P>__{(to worf)}
<D>__{... and after the ceremony on betazed, three entire weeks for our honeymoon.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{we're going sailing on the opal sea. we've booked an old fashioned solar catamaran. just us and the sun and the waves.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{it seems a very... soft honeymoon.}
<C>__{deanna}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{it's meant to be relaxing.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{a klingon honeymoon begins with the kholamar desert march where the couple bonds in endurance trials. if they survive the challenge they move on to the fire caves of fek'lhr to face the demons of gre'thor.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{well, that sounds relaxing too.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{it is... invigorating.}
<A>__{they see data enter the lounge, carefully leading the b 9.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{so they've got him up and running.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{he's a very unusual android}
<C>__{riker}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{runs in the family.}
<A>__{they watch as data leads the b 9 to a table. data instructs him to sit. the b 9 sits and stares forward placidly. data shows him how use a napkin. a note of concern passes over deanna's face as she watches data and the b 9. there is something strangely poignant in the twin androids. one a bundle of curiosity and intelligence; the other somewhat like a slow, simple child.}
