<A>__{the three of them watch the fleet pile into a navy van that reads for official use only. the moment they pull out, jerry dusts himself off and puts on a pretense of being unfazed.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{wow, those guys are even dumber than i thought. they actually think i'm stupid enough to let them muscle me into paying.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{jerry, what are you talking about? we need to call the police!}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i'm not some tattle tale like your son.}
<A>__{nick rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{then for god's sake, jerry, just sell the lincoln and pay them!}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{can't. it's in the code.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{what code? the vehicular code?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{code of the streets, babe. code of the streets.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{then what are you planning to do?}
<A>__{jerry takes a seat at the kitchen table and adopts the thinker pose. he strokes his chin as nick and estelle await his brilliant solution with breathless anticipation. i e. lincoln day}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{we are going to ukiah for a last minute vacation.}
<A>__{jerry's got on a hat made from coors beer cans. he's behind the wheel of his lincoln convertible.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{jerry says we'll be staying in a cabin on clear lake that's owned by a friend of his.}
<A>__{estelle dumps in the cooking gear and closes the trunk. her halter top looks like an advertisement for droop city. nick's in the back. estelle waves at the neighbors like she's miss corn dog of 1954.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{goodbye, everyone! we're going on vacation!}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{let's blow!}
<A>__{she hops up front with jerry. he fires up the lincoln and the radio roars to life with hillbilly music.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{i'm not sure how this is the solution to his problem. but i've decided to go along with it, seeing as i'm not rooting for him anyway.}
<A>__{as they pull out, jerry tosses his beer bottle at the garbage can at the end of the drive and it once again misses and shatters on the street behind them.}
