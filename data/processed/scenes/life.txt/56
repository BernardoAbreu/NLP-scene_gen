<L>__{interior camp 8 bunkhouse day}
<A>__{claude rips open the letter. a profound disappointment settles over him as he reads the news from cousin maynard. bitterly, he crumples up the letter and tosses it down.}
<L>__{exterior field day}
<A>__{dillard strolls down the line with his rifle over his shoulder. under his watchful gaze, hoes rise and fall. after he passes, claude moves a little closer to ray.}
<C>__{claude}

<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what do i want? what makes you think i want something?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{my daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. sure wish i could have met him }
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{cut the bullshit. what do you want, claude?}
<C>__{claude}

<C>__{ray}
<D>__{we? did i hear you say we? as i recall, you're the one who said there is no we. guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{look, my cousin maynard is a lawyer. he filed an appeal on my behalf }
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{on your behalf. what happened to we?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{the appeal was denied. then daisy went and fell for maynard. they're engaged to be married, can you believe that?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{well, let's just think about that for a moment. he's a successful lawyer up in new york city and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. eeny, meeny, miney, maynard.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{come on, man. don't shut me out. i'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you know what, claude? this whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. that plan with your cousin, did that include me?}
<A>__{a long beat.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{at least you're honest for once. so now you want to be my friend? well, let me tell you something, claude my shit don't stink banks. you got a lot to learn about friendship.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{does that mean i'm in?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i don't think so, claude. you'd just slow me down. we'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. there's no way around it, you're soft.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what'd you say?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i said you're soft.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{don't call me that. you know i hate it when you call me that.}
<A>__{ray gets in claude's face and silently mouths the word "soft." claude throws down his hoe and sinks his fist deep into ray's gut.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{damn, that felt good. i should have done that the first time i met you.}
<A>__{ray touches the blood coming from his nose. eyes blazing, he tackles claude, dragging him to the ground. the two men roll around, trying to strangle each other. hoppin' bob hustles down the hill and drags ray off of claude. but claude comes back for more. hoppin' bob finds himself in the middle of the fray. that's when the cavalry arrives. two trusties use their rifles to crack ray and claude over the backs of their heads, sending them both down for the count. hoppin' bob empties his canteen over their faces. they sputter back to consciousness.}
<C>__{hoppin' bob}
<D>__{now you girls set aside your differences and get back to work or i will see to it }
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{ we'll spend a night in the hole. we heard this shit before.}
<A>__{ray and claude stagger to their feet and pick up their tools. hoppin' bob and the trusties head back up the hill. ray starts to chuckle.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what the fuck are you laughing about?}
<A>__{ray opens his palm to reveal two pebbles. claude regards ray with new found respect.}
