<A>__{jodie, an annoyingly small dog, enters the garage from the house and starts sniffing around the body. a new chew toy!}

<P>__{(at the sound)}
<D>__{jodie, no! not for dogs!}
<A>__{he shoos the dog back into the house. paul moves back to the fridge, opens the door and, with great effort picks up the dead man and tries to stuff him inside. only problem... the man's legs don't want to fit. paul leans down and grabs an uncooperative appendage. he grits his teeth, looks away as he kicks at the knee. it snaps sideways. paul fights nausea. but with the leg now out of joint, the man fits. paul, breathing heavy, leans against the door.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{ok then. ok.}
<A>__{he packs in the remaining space with beer and pop bottles. then, just before he shuts the door, paul reaches in and sets the fridge temperature from 1 to 9 (the coldest setting). a padlock and chain come from the base of a propane bbq. it goes around the fridge, the lock snaps it in place. paul spots some leftover drink cans. he kicks them to the corner and walks into the house, trying to sound casual.}

<D>__{hey honey. any mail?}
