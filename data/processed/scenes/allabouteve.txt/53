<L>__{interior rooming house night}
<A>__{a girl, in a wrapper, at a wall phone. her hair's in curlers. she's frightened.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{my name wouldn't mean anything. i room across the hall from eve harrington, and she isn't well. she's been crying all night and hysterical, and she doesn't want a doctor...}
<A>__{richards' bedroom, lloyd is sitting on the edge of the bed, looking over...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{who is it? what's it all about?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{did miss harrington tell you to call mr. richards?}
<A>__{lloyd picks up his phone.}
<B>__{rooming house}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{no, eve didn't say to call him, but i remembered i saw mr. richards with her a couple of times and i thought they being such good friends...}
<A>__{richards' bedroom}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hello...hello, this is lloyd richards. where is eve? let me talk to her }
<B>__{rooming house}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{she's up in her room, mr. richards. i really hate to bother you like this, but the way eve's been feeling i'm just worried sick what with her leaving for new haven tomorrow, and everything...}
<A>__{richards' bedroom}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{tell her not to worry tell her i will be right over.}
<B>__{rooming house}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i will tell her, mr. richards.}
<A>__{she hangs up. as she moves from the phone, the angle widens to disclose eve at the foot of the stairs. the girls smile at each other. they go upstairs, arm in arm. richards' bedroom, karen is still in bed, phone still in her hand. she hangs up, swings her legs out, puts out her cigarette, gets into a robe. the open door and light of the dressing room tell us where lloyd is. karen walks to the door, starts to say something, changes her mind. she crosses to a table, lights a fresh cigarette, comes back to the door.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{aren't you... broadening the duties of a playwright just a bit? rushing off in the middle of the night like a country doctor?}
<A>__{no answer except the opening and closing of drawers.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what would you do if, instead of eve, the leading man had called up to say her was hysterical?}
<A>__{still no answer. her tension increasing, karen goes back to the table, snubs out the fresh cigarette, then strides swiftly back to the open door.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{lloyd, i don't want you to go!}
<A>__{now lloyd appears. he's in flannels, and a sport shirt with no tie. he's confused and guilty and tortured.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i didn't think you would! it seems to me, karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm a human being, i've got some!}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(goes right on)}
<D>__{ and for my feelings in particular! for my play, my career and now for a frightened, hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the theater!}
<A>__{he goes back into his room.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{have you forgotten about eve? what she is, what she's done?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! and a phobia against truth!}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{then tell me this isn't true! that your concern for your play and career is one thing and that poor frightened hysterical girl another and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career!}
<A>__{lloyd comes out wearing a jacket. he crosses to the door, karen after him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{that first, last, and foremost your reason for going now is that you want to be with eve! three in the morning or high noon play or no play wife or no wife!}
<P>__{(lloyd stops at the door)}
<D>__{isn't it true, lloyd?}
<A>__{lloyd goes out. karen looks after him, despairing.}
