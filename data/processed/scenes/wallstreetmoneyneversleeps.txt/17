<L>__{exterior columbia university campus day}
<A>__{as jacob bounds the steps of the business school and heads into the old stone building.}
<L>__{interior columbia school of business uris lecture hall day}
<A>__{the lecture hall is packed with wall to wall students. jacob stands at the back. a professor is at the podium.}
<C>__{professor}
<D>__{our speaker today has quite a checkered background in the world of finance.}
<A>__{some laughter from the room.}
<C>__{professor }
<D>__{he graduated from city college in 1966 and became a securities broker at hudson river bank then moved on to smith barney. in 1973 he went out on his own to establish a spectacular career as a independent trader then an active participant in the lbo craze of the 1980s.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{in 1988, he was indicted for insider trading and then charged with other various forms of securities fraud and irs violations. in one of the most harshest sentences ever given to a white collar criminal... he served fourteen years in a maximum security prison and he wants me to stress that it was not a country club.}
<A>__{again laughter from the floor.}
<C>__{professor }
<D>__{since his release in 2002, he has written and has spoken publicly about what he refers to as the current state of the world economy. he is not allowed to trade on the us exchanges. his new book "moral hazard! why wall street has finally gone too far." comes out in october.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{please welcome... gordon gekko!}
<A>__{the room applauds... and out to the podium slowly walks...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<A>__{no swagger in his step... not in a suit... hair not slicked back... but still looks fucking good. as he waits for the applause to wind down... and even a little longer... surveying every corner of the large room... commanding its full attention... getting it... holding the silence... until finally... he leans into the mic and says...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{you're all pretty much fucked.}
<A>__{the room breaks into laughter... gordon smiles and waits for it to die down.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{what's not funny is what's happening out there. i don't think people get it. and i know the financial center of the world doesn't get it... which happens to be washington dc now.}
<A>__{as he takes to a pace...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{to understand where we are, we need to understand how we got here. no good deed goes unpunished, all fires start with a well meaning spark and we wanted americans to be able to afford homes. sounds nice enough... lets try to get the middle and lower classes into homes they can own. so we made money cheap and lowered restrictions on mortgage lending.}
<A>__{as he takes a moment and looks over the room...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{somebody reminded me the other night that i once said "greed is good." i swear i don't remember it but it sounds like something i would say in the eighties.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i was right then. greed was good. america needed greed and risk taking and leverage to get to become the superpower we are... or were. and capitalism needed greed and risk and leverage to become the economic platform it has become... but those same attributes that got us there are now the liabilities that threaten to destroy us.}
<A>__{jacob's blackberry vibrates and he checks it. he has a texterior "kzi!!! wtf?"}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{so greed has been redefined. who knows maybe it was always like this and like everything else in this world, it's good and it is evil.}
<A>__{taking a moment to survey the room...}
<B>__{.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{because people it's greed that caused someone who aspires to own a seven hundred thousand dollar house they can't afford, to take on a loan they'll never be able to pay back... and it's greed that caused their mortgage lender to give them that loan then sell it right away... and it's greed that caused the buyer of that loan to slice it into a million little pieces then spit them all over the world... and it's greed that caused the rating agency to give that toxic loan a triple a rating just because it was mixed in with some good loans... and it's greed that caused the insurance company to insure that loan.}
<A>__{jacob quickly glances down again at his blackberry and checks the quote, kzi $14.53.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{they were insuring the end of the world; "when the world explodes... just find us in the rubble and we'll be sure to pay your claim."}
<A>__{drawing in a deep breath...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{cmo's, clo's, cbo's, cdo's, cds's, spe's, abcp's,siv's, remic's, cmbs's, toxic traunches, ninja loans, credit default swaps, affinity marketing, stapled financing, synthetic securitization.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe i was in prison too long but i have no idea what half that shit means.}
<A>__{the room laughs in agreement.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{and i'm considered a pretty smart guy when it comes to finance!}
<A>__{and jacob's blackberry vibrates again. this time he removes it from his pocket, doesn't check it and simply turns it off.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{and if i know our central bank which i do i predict it's going to throw gasoline on this fire with more cheap money and federal bailouts and head in the sand manipulated statistics on productivity and inflation.}
<A>__{and gordon stops pacing... takes a moment for effect.}
<B>__{.}
<A>__{then sums it all up with...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{so no good deed goes unpunished and all fires start with a well meaning spark and when you take free money and no lending standards then add it with unaccountable risk and ungodly leverage and unbridled greed... what you end up with is cancer.}
<A>__{and gordon takes in a deep breath...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{systemic, malignant and global.}
<A>__{now the room is completely silent.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{do they still have the v&t restaurant on amsterdam? is that still there?}
<A>__{a stunned girl in the front row shakes her head.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{god, i loved their pizza.}
