<A>__{billy, tenser than ever, uses the occasion of buying a newspaper at an outdoor stand to study: the main square of the village (edirne) day. soldiers and police are abundant, chattering bustling amid tanks and half tracks. mountains can be seen in the far distance. billy camouflages his face as best he can in the newspaper "hurriyet" studying: cabdrivers in the main square. most of them are older, grizzled looking standing next to their old battered dusty cabs talking with stray soldiers. billy's eyes settle on a younger driver with longish hair, possibly an ally. billy glances down at his newspaper as a soldier intersects and his expression goes stony as he sees: full color drawing (first page) of a ridiculously fierce heavy muscled barechested man beating a facsimile of hamidou into the ground. next to it a blurry badly reproduced photograph of billy with a superimposed gun in his hand. you can't really tell it's him. billy, controlling himself, crumples up the newspaper into a baton, his eyes everywhere. be the darting a crosses square. another angle billy, intersecting a policeman who glances at him, joins the young cabdriver..}
