<L>__{into oriental night}
<A>__{the curious crowd outside, watching through the windows. morgan is on the pool table, lying on his side with his shirt pulled up. the dog cowers in the corner, whining while dr. goodfellow digs into the wound with a steel probe, making morgan writhe in perfect agony. the doctor turns to wyatt:}
<C>__{dr. goodfellow}
<D>__{hold him.}
<A>__{wyatt takes morgan in his arms. the doctor probes. morgan jerks violently. suddenly we hear a blood curdling scream. louisa is in the doorway, tearing her hair, lost in utter hysterics.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{oh, no, get her out of her! jesus!}
<A>__{and now the whole scene sinks into hellish confusion with the dog whimpering, louisa shrieking as others restrain her, and morgan gives a violet jerk, breaking wyatt's grip. the doctor snarls, about at the end of his rope.}
<C>__{dr. goodfellow}
<D>__{i said hold him, god damn it!}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{somebody shut that dog up!}
<A>__{morgan takes wyatt's arm, his voice like a child's.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{you were right, wyatt. they got me good. don't let 'em get you too.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{will somebody get the damn dog out }
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{remember about the light you're supposed to see when you're dyin'?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{easy morg, don't think about that now.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{isn't true. i can't see a damn thing.}
<A>__{tears well up in wyatt's eyes. he touches his brother's face. morgan's eyelids start fluttering. wyatt squeezes his hand.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{morgan? morgan!}
<A>__{the dog starts howling, long and loud and pitiful and in the next moment the air is filled with howls as every dog and coyote for miles joins in the mourning. wyatt backs away from his dead brother and trudges out onto the sidewalk, staring at the blood on his hands. standing in the crowd across the street, josephine sees wyatt and starts for him. behan grabs her. she wrenches free and with the whole town watching, starts running toward wyatt. seeing her, wyatt backs away in horror, shaking his head:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{no, no, get away, get away from me...}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{wyatt...}
<A>__{she keeps coming. wyatt panics. finally, in desperation:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{whore! filthy whore! get away from me!}
<A>__{she pauses, unable to believe her ears, then runs away crying. fuming with rage, kate starts after wyatt. doc pulls her back:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{can't you see why he did it?}
<A>__{the howls continue as wyatt trudges down the street alone. suddenly he doubles over, clutching his abdomen in agony, staring at his bloody hands....}
