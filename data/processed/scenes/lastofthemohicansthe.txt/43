<L>__{exterior forest wide late afternoon}
<A>__{deep fog has set in. a hand entering the frame scares the hell out of us. it moves a branch aside. it's uncas. spread to the right is chingachgook, far to the left is hawkeye. they hike up a steep forested slope in the heart of the adirondacks.}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{much further?}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{top of this ridge. fort and lake george are downhill of it.}
<B>__{alice}
<A>__{re energized, her spirits pick up.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{will we be able to bathe?}
<A>__{before cora can answer they hear a deep, rolling roar. alice is alarmed.}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{thunder ... papa will arrange something.}
<B>__{uncas}
<A>__{looks over his shoulder, sees something in the far distance, gestures to hawkeye and chingachgook. hawkeye's pov: distant hills and the band of red painted ottawa and coureurs des bois, who have now split into two groups, are still on their trail. meanwhile, oblivious ...}
<C>__{heyward}
<D>__{the men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, alice ...}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{duncan, you are absolutely gallant. if cora doesn't marry you, i shall.}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{alice!}
<A>__{heyward laughs. hawkeye sees them. it bothers us: will these europeans, including cora, shed their frontier experience?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i can't wait to see papa ...}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{and you, duncan? what are you looking forward to?}
<C>__{heyward}
<D>__{posting to a different continent.}
<A>__{he and alice laugh. cora does not.}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{i think it's very important and exciting.}
<A>__{heyward looks at her. she's not kidding. another angle: heyward helps alice. as he does, he stares at cora's seperation and now her proximity to hawkeye, who's walking on ahead, is something heyward doesn't like. his dark thoughts are distracted by a flash of light and more rolling thunder. wide from the front hawkeye drops and pulls cora to the ground.}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{lightning?}
<A>__{hawkeye doesn't answer as he, chingachgook, uncas and heyward make their way to the top of the ridge. closer angles: cora & alice join them and look down upon their expectation of a secure piece of england in the wilderness, a safe harbor, a father's warm welcome. their pov: fort william henry is none of those things. the thunder is the roar of french siege cannon clouded in dense smoke. the flashes of light are mortar bombs exploding and illumination rockets' red glare. fort william henry is under a massive siege by a french and huron army.}
<B>__{uncas}
<A>__{looks over his shoulder. his pov: ottawa pursuing them. there's no way back. they're propelled forward.}
