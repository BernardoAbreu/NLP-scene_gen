<A>__{wind moans. dead leaves blow across the windy lane as tommy flies down the path of the blankenship house and hops into his explorer. the shape suddenly rises into frame. watching him peel off down the block. taillights disappearing. a moment later, another car rambles up the street, swerving erratically into the driveway of the myers house. the shape watches.}
<L>__{interior garage night (continuous)}
<A>__{the car parks. sits in silence. suddenly the driver's side door opens, emblazoned with the "strode realty" emblem. john spills out, collar unbuttoned, tie dangling. picking himself up, he staggers out of the garage. laughing. singing.}
