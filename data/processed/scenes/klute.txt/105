<L>__{interior bree's apartment day}
<A>__{it is late afternoon, but bree is in her pajamas curled up in her bed. there are some magazines scattered around the bed and the television set is on an old movie. there are cracker crumbs in the bed and a cup of coffee and an open jar of peanut butter with the knife sticking out of the jar on the floor by the bed. it would seem that bree has spent most of the day in bed. she looks like an unkempt child. the phone is ringing, but she does not answer it. the phone no sooner stops than the door bell rings. reluctantly she gets out of bed and goes to the door. she looks through the spy hole and sees klute's face. she undoes two locks and an obviously new chain and bolt and opens the door.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{well hello come on in.}
<A>__{he barely enters the room. his manner is cool and remote.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{i thought you ought to know, arlyn page is dead.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{the same as jane mckenna.}
<C>__{bree}
<P>__{(she betrays no reaction)}
<D>__{thanks for the jolly news. i thought maybe you'd left town by now. you kind of just disappeared. but you boys from tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?}
<A>__{klute looks around the disorderly room. the plants in the windowsill have never been in worse shape. they look as if she deliberately let them die of thirst.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{the next few weeks i would like to know where you are all the time.}
<C>__{bree}
<P>__{(harshly)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{just let me know when you are going out and where }
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{what if i go out on tricks you wanna come along? you could sit and read the national geographic.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{how can you do it to yourself?}
<C>__{bree}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{i don't get you.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{ligourin: how could you do it?}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{i told you before, you wouldn't understand.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{you're right, i don't understand. explain it to me.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you were scared. arlyn page, that scared you. well it should; that's death. so what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. ligourin kills women.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{no, no you're right, i'm sorry. he uses women; he lets them kill themselves. is that how you want it?}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{arlyn was a junkie; i'm not on junk!}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{no, you can find some other way.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{explain it to me. bree, show me any sense to }
<C>__{bree}
<P>__{(screams, incoherently)}
<D>__{you get the christ out! you dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! i don't have to show you anything; you get out!}
<A>__{klute goes.}
