<L>__{interior link room day}
<A>__{next morning, grace, norm and jake approach their link units. jake glances through a pressure window. in an adjoining chamber (the ambient room) jake's avatar lies on a gurney, breathing slowly in pandoran air. norm's avatar is on a second gurney. both are attended by med techs in exo masks. norm slips into his link chair, expertly donning biometric sensors.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{how much link time have you logged?}
<C>__{norm}
<D>__{five hundred and twenty hours.}
<A>__{grace looks pointedly at jake.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{like an hour.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{tell me you're joking.}
<A>__{grace opens the hood of jake's link unit. jake starts hauling himself across from his wheelchair. she reaches to help him but }
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{don't! i got this.}
<A>__{grace steps back, hands raised. he drags himself into the unit.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{so you just figured you'd come out here to the most hostile environment known to man, with no training of any kind, and see how it went? what was going through your head?}
<A>__{he meets her eyes with a defiant glare.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{maybe i was just tired of doctors telling me what i couldn't do.}
<A>__{grace watches him laboriously pull his inert legs into the link chair by hand. jake settles into the warm fluid gel packs lining the unit. it seems to enfold him. grace adjusts his biometric sensors, then lowers the upper clamshell }
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{relax and let your mind go blank. that shouldn't be hard for you.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{kiss the darkest part of my lily white }
<A>__{but the slamming hood muffles the rest.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{initiate link.}
<A>__{the link tech touches some controls. on a large monitor a 3d scan of jake's brain appears. regions of activity flow with complex shifting colors.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{that's a gorgeous brain. nice activity.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{go figure.}
<P>__{(walking away)}
<D>__{alright, i'm going in.}
<C>__{tech}
<D>__{phase lock at forty percent. he's in transition.}
<A>__{max watches a display showing the avatar's nervous system aligning with jake's two ghostly networks of light merging.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{that's it. find your way home.}
<A>__{ecu jake, inside the link unit. his eyes move under the lids, like a dreamer in rem sleep as inside jake's mind radiant streamers coalesce into a pulsing tunnel of light and the screen flares white zzzwhap! resolving into an overexposed, out of focus image two blurry faces wearing masks, looking down. ecu jake's avatar two very intense eyes fill frame, the pupils contracting. golden irises pulse with life.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{he's in.}
<C>__{tech}
<D>__{phase lock ninety nine percent. the link is stable.}
<A>__{blinking, jake slowly sits up on the gurney. he looks down at his avatar body, touching his chest with one hand.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{take it slow, jake. we need to check your motor control. try touching your fingertips together }
<A>__{but jake isn't listening. he's staring at his legs. he eases them off the gurney and his blue feet touch the concrete floor, taking his weight. jake stands, feeling the strength in his legs. his expression is child like with wonder. his pov looking down at the med techs, who seem the size of children next to his 9' tall frame. he sees something like a blue tentacle curl across his arm and he jerks around in alarm. his tail. as he turns to see it, the tail sweeps instruments off a table with a crash. jake laughs and grins at max.}
<C>__{med tech}
<D>__{easy, jake, i need you to sit down }
<A>__{but jake takes a step, then another. the wires to the bio monitors pull taut, and he yanks them off his chest.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{jake! wait, we have to run some tests }
