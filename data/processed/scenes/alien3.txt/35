<L>__{interior transom space prison level}
<A>__{an enormous open space between "cell blocks." the wall behind them is honey combed with corridor openings going up four stories, connected by aged, warped wooden ladders reminiscent of indian cave dwellings. only wooden. the room stretches several football field lengths ahead of them falling off into gloom. they stand silent for a moment, dwarfed by the size of the room and the task ahead of them. finally }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{at any rate, let's forget about the earth completely whether you're right or i'm right what's important is getting the hell out of here. from here my ship is...?}
<A>__{john points up at the ceiling.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{in heaven.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{right. and this is...}
<A>__{anthony and john nod.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{this orbiter was patterned after a medieval concept of the universe }
<P>__{(makes a circle in the air)}
<D>__{they call the top half "heaven "}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the abbey, the fields }
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{the bottom half is "hell." where we are.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{aptly named. what's in the middle?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the sea.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{work with me here. how far is it back to the surface of the planet?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{as a stone falls five miles through the center.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{and the elevator the thing they lowered me down in?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ropes cut.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{it's smart. first he cuts their escape off, then works his way down through the monastery level by level until there isn't a thing left alive. interesting...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{well, you start appreciating him more than me and i will find a way to shut you down, capisce, andy? how do we get up?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{there are ladders.}
<A>__{she stops. john and anthony continue on a few steps and then stop and walk back to her.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{five miles with the alien between us and there? good luck, boys.}
<A>__{she turns and heads back towards her cell john catches her shoulder }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you can't }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{can't what? not help you go to your deaths? i've had my fill of that.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i need you. i can't do it alone.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i've fought these creatures twice before. it take a lot to kill these things. heavy artillery.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{we don't have weapons here.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{how about something we can make weapons from? do you have anything like that any modern things here?}
<A>__{john shakes his head vehemently }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we renounced technology. it was those things that caused the plague.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{this is a man made planet. something has to be recirculating your air, your water.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{god?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't know. i just took it for granted.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{most people do. without some sort of technology we haven't got a chance.}
<A>__{from behind them:}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{there is technology.}
<A>__{john and ripley turn to look at him.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{a room. a technology room. fresh air and water come out.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{an atmosphere processing plant }
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{the heart and lungs of arceon.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{where is it?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{one level beneath the underground sea.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that's five levels up }
<C>__{anthony}
<P>__{(points into the gloom)}
<D>__{on the other side of the orbiter.}
<A>__{john looks at ripley }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{a chance.}
<A>__{ripley looks from john's earnest face to the darkness and back.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{all right. you've got me so far. but here's the deal: i don't know how many of your brethren are going to be alive when we get up there, but if we make it to my ship, you're all coming with me. we'll take as many of your precious books as we can carry, but we're going. i'm not going to fight this thing again to end up alone again. understand?}
<A>__{john nods his head.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{we're all dead anyway. we might as well go fi }
<A>__{she feels a twinge in her midsection doubles over. anthony and john each take an arm }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{ugh i'm all right.}
<A>__{she takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{still thawing out. i hate hyper sleep... come on.}
