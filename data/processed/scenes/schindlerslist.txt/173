<L>__{exterior forest plaszow later day}
<A>__{a creek flowing gently through marshy ground under an umbrella of trees. leo john and his five year old son, on their knees catching tadpoles, seem unaware of, or at least not distracted by, a ghastly endeavor going on beyond them: bodies being exhumed out of the earth, out of the mass graves in the forest. the dead lay everywhere, victims of the ghetto massacre, victims of plaszow. arriving, schindler sees goeth standing up at the tree line. approaching him, furious, he hesitates. he sees a wheelbarrow trundled by pfefferberg, a corpse in it. he fears the body is mila's, but then sees her trundling another barrow, another corpse in it. goeth calls to schindler }
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{can you believe this?}
<A>__{goeth shakes his head, dismayed. schindler joins him and stares at a pyre of bodies built by masked and gagging workers, layer upon layer.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{i'm trying to live my life, they come up with this? i got to find every body buried up here? and burn it?}
<A>__{it's always something. he glances off. the pyre has reached the height of a man's shoulder. the workers move around it dousing it with gasoline.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you took my workers.}
<C>__{goeth}
<P>__{(indignant)}
<D>__{they're taking mine. when i said they didn't have a future i didn't mean tomorrow.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{auschwitz.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{i don't know. soon.}
<A>__{he sighs at the unfairness of it all, the dissolution of his kingdom. his glance finds his man, leo john, over at the stream.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{this is good. i'm out of business and he's catching tadpoles with his son.}
<A>__{tight on the gleeful boy with a tadpole in his hand. behind him, smoke from the pyre rises into the sky.}
