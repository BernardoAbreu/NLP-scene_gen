<D>__{henry (v.o.) (cont'd) fitzgerald was one of the truly great american writers of the 20th century. tender is the night. the last tycoon. this side of paradise. and, of course, my favorite, the great gatsby. but fitzgerald ended up out here. writing movies that never got made. drinking too much. alienating people. losing his way.}

<A>__{they sit around the dining room table. colette, convinced she's the next amy tan, reads aloud from her typed pages. the others all have copies in front of them. we recognize henry, the frog waiting to become a prince, making copious notes and alan, oh so proud, hanging on every word. beaming. three others round out the group: younger man (early 30s). unshaven. always thinks he's the coolest guy in any room. can't avoid glances at the camera. caption: william bruce the oldest member of the group (over 60) sits with his arms folded as he listens, shifting in his chair. captain grumpy. caption: john k. butzin finally, the young (mid to late 20s), angelic, woman listening intently, the one who probably stopped to rescue a cat on her way here. caption: hannah rinaldi}
<C>__{colette }
<D>__{...any second that she might explode, her chastity spraying across the ceiling...spraying across the ceiling like passionate graffiti. natasha never thought such a moment possible. "have i satisfied you, natasha?" yuri had inquired after their fourth round of vodka soaked lovemaking. "nyet, not yet," natasha stated, exhausted, but grateful.}

<L>__{interior henry's apartment day}
<A>__{henry's sparse studio apartment. minimal furniture. his laptop is set up on an old door, stretched across some blue plastic crates. there are books piled everywhere. all sorts of books. and paper pieces of paper, including letters and cards and printed emails, dozens of them, are taped throughout the small apartment. we are introduced to henry the writer: pondering over his battered laptop, pacing up and down the floor, checking his nearly empty refrigerator, stretched out on his goodwill couch, watching tv. finally, inspiration. henry rushes to his desk and taps out a sentence or two on his computer, feeling proud for his accomplishment.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{i graduated from the university of illinois. english major. taught high school for a couple years, but hated it. moved out here to be a writer.}

<C>__{henry }
<D>__{i have two unpublished novels. working on my third, pizza to go. these are my rejection letters. rejected by agents. rejected by publishers. when you think about it, it's pretty amazing how many ways people can reject you.}

<C>__{john }
<D>__{you're still going to have to explain why this natasha dame goes awol on her husband. still kinda iffy to me.}
<A>__{another glance at the camera: did you get that?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i was bothered by that, too. why would natasha betray a reliable, dependable husband for a washed up young punk?}
<A>__{all eyes on colette. she shifts in her chair. uncomfortable.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{oh. well...um...um...}
<A>__{an uneasy silence. colette is blocked nowhere to go creatively. her face tightens up. bites her lip.}
<C>__{colette }
<D>__{oh god. i've been rewriting and rewriting and rewriting and }
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{poodles. it's ok.}

<C>__{henry}
<D>__{ yes. i was thinking the same thing.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{make it clear that natasha wants to be closer...}
<A>__{colette makes notes furiously, nodding in agreement.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{writing can be such a solitary existence, so it's good to have this outlet where you can meet other writers and exchange ideas. here it really is all for one and one for all.}

<D>__{what do you think? on or off? do they make me look smarter? i need a new pair.}
<A>__{she takes the glasses off. puts them back on. off again. debating. hannah prepares herself with a series of quick breaths and waves her hands in the air. then she stares directly into the camera.}
<C>__{hannah }
<D>__{hi. i'm originally from prescott, arizona. followed my mom out here about four years ago. that's her back there.}

<C>__{william }
<D>__{just kidding. i'm actually 28. hometown is modesto, california, a sprawling junk heap of a town without a soul. why did i come to la? um, because i knew you were here and that you'd loan me a hundred bucks if i needed it. right?}
<A>__{waitress #1 refills his coffee cup. her reward is that smile.}

<C>__{william }
<D>__{so 'bout that hundred bucks? what d'ya think?}
