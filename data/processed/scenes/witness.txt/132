<A>__{she nods, looks away... looks back at him twice in glances. there is a moment when it appears she might either bark at him or begin to weep. he waits. when she does turn to him, she speaks softly:}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{there was a time when i thought you might have stayed.}
<C>__{book}

<A>__{he has offended her, immediately knows it, but can't bring himself to make an instant apology. but he's chewing on it when she takes the moment unto herself. she pulls herself up, speaks with great dignity:}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i could never love a man who was so... little.}
<A>__{he looks at her, sad eyed, his anger ebbing and gone, realizing that he'll never meet a finer woman... never even get close to such a one. he appears to start to speak, but then does not. she turns, moves away a few steps, stops, looks back at him. she holds for a moment, blinking tears, then speaks with some difficulty, emotion welling in her words.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{the other night... when you saw me after my bath... i... i tried to look as i thought you would want a woman to look.}
<P>__{(sadly... but with a}
<D>__{slight, proud lift}
<P>__{of chin)}
<D>__{i am sorry... that i did not.}
<A>__{she holds for an instant, then turns and walks off.}
<B>__{book}
<A>__{looking after her. a face full of loss.}
