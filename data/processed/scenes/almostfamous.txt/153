<L>__{exterior st. regis day}
<A>__{russell and band spill out of limo. the new york cluster of hardcore stillwater fans wait outside. they hold collector's sleeves covering albums to be autographed, and fresh magic markers in hand. william in tow crawls out of the limo last. dick goes to work, pulling luggage from the trunk. a serious looking fan (lenny) approaches russell with an autograph card.}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{i'm from the church of lenny. we bow to his will and all that it represents the king of the king of kings.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{make it out to ?}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{to lenny.}
<A>__{russell nods of course. he signs, as dick approaches with a well placed word in his right ear.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{she's here.}
<A>__{william turns, expecting to see penny. instead we see the long limbed, athletic, pretty and collegiate leslie. she holds a nikon camera, and snaps their picture.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{leslie!}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{your room is completely stocked, far away from any noisy ice machines, elevators or maid quarters. the air conditioning is already on. and here is your security key by the way, you look stunning.}
<C>__{leslie}
<P>__{(taking treatment for granted)}
<D>__{thanksi willseeyoulater.}
<A>__{nearby, the young journalist studies the tour's subtle shift in welcoming leslie. dick's new york side is almost military.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{bags in five! cars leave for the party at six!}
<A>__{william studies leslie, everyone saying hello to her, everyone knowing the subtexterior nobody saying a word. william pulls his heavy bag out of the back of the limousine. the bag breaks, and the contents spill out onto the new york sidewalk. bars of soap, ashtrays, hotel keys, crumpled paper, the contraband t shirt, "do not disturb" signs, notes, towels and thick telephone books from every city.}
<C>__{dick }
<D>__{you know. there are lighter souvenirs.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{well i kept thinking i was going home the next day }
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i did too. fifteen years ago.}
<A>__{all help him with his spilled souvenirs. russell shares a private look with the kid. nearby leslie greets other band members.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{ric!}
<A>__{it's super zeppelin fan ric nunez.}
<C>__{ric}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{it's all happening. zeppelin is at the plaza. so's four other bands. they're partying up there right now. sapphire, and miss penny lane too... she wants you to call her.}
<P>__{(william reacts)}
<D>__{they're all staying under the name emily rugburn.}
<A>__{william takes in the information, while regarding ric's new custom shirt, which features the words to zeppelin's "the rain song."}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(exiting with leslie)}
<D>__{after the party. i will come to your room i promise. we'll talk. this is leslie, by the way. leslie, this is our wayward friend from rolling stone.}
<A>__{the enemy. they shake, she smiles randomly.}
