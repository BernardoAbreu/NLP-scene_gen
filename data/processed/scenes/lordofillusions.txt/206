<L>__{interior nix's house meditation room night}
<A>__{the pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. dorothea is backed towards it by nix. when nix speaks, his voice is not remotely human. it is}
<B>__{demoniacal.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{i am the purest of the pure. i am the darkest of the dark...}
<A>__{harry is at the door now, starting towards nix.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{harry. you can't kill him.}
<A>__{harry crouches beside swann.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{he did something with the ground.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{can you do it?}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{try.}
<A>__{on dorothea. she's a couple of yards from the pit now.}
<C>__{nix }
<D>__{i'm beyond heaven. i'm beyond hell.}
<A>__{suddenly, harry lunges at nix, grabbing hold of his legs. nix topples. on swann, who puts his hands on the ground. closes his eyes. a wave of liquification runs through the ground from swann's broken fingers the cultists' bodies move in the softening ground, like corpses in surf, and roll towards the pit, their dead faces resurfacing barbara's body floats past nix, and disappears over the edge of the pit.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(to dorothea)}
<D>__{get out of here!}
<A>__{the ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging around nix as they're all carried towards the pit. so's harry, of course. nix tries to get up, but he's too late. the corpses weigh him down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper hold, and harry still clings to his legs.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{no! no! no!}
<A>__{he's at the edge of the pit.}
<C>__{dorothea }
<D>__{harry!}
<A>__{harry looks round. dorothea's behind him, risking the flowing ground to offer him a hand. nix starts to fall into the pit. at the last minute, he reaches for harry, as harry is pulled out of reach bv dorothea. together they stumble to the door, where swann still lies. they look back to see nix, as he goes over the edge of the pit and falls screaming. at the door, dorothea lifts up swann's head. he's dead. she closes his eyes.}
