<L>__{exterior scottish village, at the edge of town day}
<A>__{flutes and dancing; laughter and garlands; village families have gathered for a wedding celebration we see the happy bride and groom. farmers cart in fresh bread and hoops of cheese; villagers arrive with casks of beer or strings of smoked fish. and watching the people are ubiquitous english soldiers, battlescarred veterans with missing eyes and ears. riding along the road comes william wallace. grown now, a man. he sits his horse as if born there, his back straight, his hands relaxed on the reins. he has a look of lean, rippled power. he looks dangerous. and the soldiers notice him, nudging each other as he passes. he carries a dead wild goose hanging across his saddle; he stops his horse at the edge of the clearing and surveys the scene. farmers are roasting a pig; women are comparing handiwork; young men are tossing huge stones in the traditional highland games and everyone is noticing william's arrival, especially the farm women with daughters of marriageable age. among those watching william arrive is campbell, grown older now; and with his old rebel friend, macclannough. william dismounts and ties his horse to a willow. one of the english soldiers shoves william from behind.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{hey boy! you hunt this bird?}
<A>__{william's eyes fix themselves on the soldier.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{it's against the law for scots to own bows. you shot this bird?}
<A>__{his buddies, enjoying their role as intimidators, grab the bird and begin to search it for evidence.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i hit it in the head. with a rock.}
<A>__{they don't believe that but they can't find any puncture wound on the bird. william reaches his hand out for the return of the bird. the soldiers drop it onto the ground. slowly, william picks it up, and heads into the clearing. the farmers watch him come. among those noticing william's arrival, but pretending not to, is marion macclannough, grown now into a stunning young woman; her long auburn hair reminds us of those years long ago; she wears it the same way, straight and full down her back. her dress is plain, like the grass that surrounds a wildflower. she's the most beautiful girl in the village, maybe in all of scotland, and the soldiers who hassled william notice her too. william reaches the food table and contributes his goose to the feast. farm women eye him; he nodes to one.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{miz macdougal. you look well.}
<C>__{farm woman}
<D>__{...william? it's william wallace, back home! have you met my daughter?}
<A>__{the daughter mentioned is missing teeth. william nods to her. it's impossible for him to giver her a smile as bright as her hopes, and she lowers her head in disappointment. but then raises her face in surprise as william takes her hand and gives her a respectful bow. he moves away from the table, passing through the crowd like a stranger. then he glances toward the knot of girls. he sees marion. she sees him, then looks away. do they remember each other? he moves toward her; she is shy, her eyes downcast, but then she raises them and looks at him. they move closer and closer together. just as they are about to reach each other, a huge round stone thumps to the earth at williams' feet. he looks up to see one of marion's suitors the broad, muscled young man who has just tossed the stone in william's way. now everybody's looking to see how william will handle the challenge. he tries to move around, but the guy cuts him off. then william thinks he recognizes the big red head.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{hamish?}
<A>__{it is his old friend, but hamish won't admit it, or be put off from the challenge. he points to the huge stone.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{test of manhood.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{you win.}
<C>__{hamish}
<P>__{(blocks him)}
<D>__{call it a test of soldiery, then. the english won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{the test of a soldier is not in his arm. it's here.}
<A>__{he taps his temple. hamish stretches out his hand, as if to show william something in his palm.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{no. it's here.}
<A>__{with a sudden movement, he slams his fist into william's jaw, dropping him. a few men move to interfere, but campbell, macclannough, and the other farmers who are the true leaders here, stop their neighbors from interrupting. hamish stands over william, waiting for him to get up.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{a contest, then.}
<A>__{william stands and hoists the huge stone, eighteen inches in diameter. straining with the effort, he lugs the stone to the line scratched in the rocky field. beyond the line are the muddy dents from previous tosses. william takes a run and heaves the stone. it flies past the other marks in the field; people are impressed. william looks at hamish.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i still say this is no test. a catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{that depends on the man.}
<A>__{hamish walks out, lifts the stone, and lugs it back to the line. he takes a run and heaves with a great groan! the stone flies, passing william's mark by a couple of feet. people laugh and whistle. william nods, impressed.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{can you do it when it matters? as it matters in battle? could you crush a man with that throw?}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{i could crush you like a roach.}
<A>__{william walks to the dent made by hamish's throw.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{then do it. come, do it.}
<A>__{hamish scowls at william, at everybody watching. he lifts the stone and carries it back to the line. william stands calmly. hamish backs up for his run. william yawns.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{you'll move}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i will not.}
<A>__{hamish backs up a few more feet, for a longer run.}
<C>__{farmer stewart}
<D>__{that's not fair!}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{he's tired, he should get a longer run.}
<A>__{william seems completely unafraid. he leans down, picks up a small smooth stone and tosses it up in the air casually. stung by this show of calm, hamish takes furious run, and heaves! the stone flies through the air, just misses william's head, and buries itself halfway into the earth behind him. william never flinches. the people cheer.}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{brave show!}
<A>__{hamish is miffed; it's like william won.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{i threw longer than last time!}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{an ox is strong, but not clever.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{an ox is stupid enough to just stand in one place.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{that's not the pointerior}
<A>__{william turns, walks double the distance hamish threw, and turns and hurls the rock he holds! it whistles through the air, hits hamish in the forehead, and drops him like a shot.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{that is.}
<A>__{everybody cheers and laughs! they surround william.}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{a fine display, young wallace!}
<A>__{william takes a tankard of ale from a farmer, walks over and tosses the cold liquid into hamish's face; he wakes, and, his eyes uncrossing, accepts william's hand, pulling him up.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{good to see you again.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{i should'a remembered the eggs.}
<A>__{grinning, they embrace. music plays, the dancing begins. william walks to the knot of young ladies... but passes marion, and moves to the girl with the missing teeth.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{would you honor me with a dance?}
<A>__{she's thrilled to accept; they begin to dance.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{you've taken over your father's farm?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they say he died long ago. fighting the english.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{he died in an accident, with my brother. their cart turned over.}
<A>__{the musicians interrupt their playing; a group of heavily armed horsemen, with banners and flying colors, ride up, reining their horses into the middle of the celebration. in the middle of the group is an english nobleman; he is gray, in his fifties, and stops in front of the bride and groom.}
<C>__{nobleman}
<D>__{i have come to claim the right of prima noctes. as the lord of these lands, i will bless this marriage by taking the bride into my bed on the first night of her union.}
<A>__{stewart, father of the bride, lunges forward.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{no, by god!}
<A>__{the horsemen point their lances at the unarmed scots who see that the english soldiers from the village have moved to the edge of the gathering, as if to dare any resistance.}
<C>__{nobleman}
<D>__{it is my noble right.}
<A>__{even unarmed, stewart is about to attack but the bride intervenes. she grabs her father and whispers to him. she moves to her husband and does the same. holding back tears, she allows herself to be pulled up behind one of the horsemen. marion macclannough is looking on, sobered by her friend's courage and sickened by her fate and marion is even more unsettled as she notices that one of the soldiers, a particularly nasty looking brute with a scarred face, is leering at her. william wallace sees this too. the noble and his escorts ride away, and as they do it begins to rain. the celebration destroyed, the scots gather the food and disperse to their homes. but wallace remains, standing in the downpour, keeping his thoughts to himself.}
