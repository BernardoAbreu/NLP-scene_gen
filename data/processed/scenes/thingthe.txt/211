<A>__{a sharp, red, talon like fingernail, pierces the top of the door above nauls' head. it saws downward, quickly. black goo drips through the slit. the sawing obscured by the music. sanchez, eyes bulging, points. nauls turns. a claw rips through the wood. nauls dives to the floor. in the opposite direction, behind sanchez, another arm splits through the door and the refrigerator, extends itself five feet and yanks sanchez back as if he were a puppet. sanchez struggles, looking imploringly at nauls. he bites down on his capsule. nauls takes off like a speed skater.}
