<A>__{several shark fins cut the surface, appearing and disappearing in the bright moonlight. they are shadowing }

<A>__{the submarine has stopped. the water is calm. the moon is bright. a gentle swell splashes indy awake. he blinks, tries to regain his senses. he makes an inventory of his body. surprised to find himself intact, his spirits lift. some hidden reserve of energy flows through him. he frees his aching arms from the wet leather of his whip, leaving only one loop around his waist to hold him to the sub. he rubs his hands and stretches. once again, he has survived. to fight again. he looks around.}
<B>__{what he sees}
<A>__{a lovely island. no sign of man's presence. the sub has stopped at the mouth of a wide cove completely ringed by tall white rock cliffs. suddenly the sub begins to move again. it is headed directly toward the center of the cliffs. indy holds on, mystified, alert. when the cliffs are very close, the sub begins to dive.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{damn!}
<A>__{he thinks hard. inspiration hits just before the water. indy flips his leather jacket up over his head and holds the jacket out in front of him. his head is hidden by the jacket as he goes under water.}
