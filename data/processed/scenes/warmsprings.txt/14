<L>__{interior franklin's bedroom early morning}
<A>__{franklin lays sleeping in his bed as eleanor enters quietly so as not to wake him. carefully she picks up a set of keys on the dresser then turns and notices a packet of letters sitting on top of an open duffle bag. tentatively she reaches for them. she brings the packet, tied with a piece of ribbon, up to her nose. she is shocked by their familiar scent. with trembling hands she unties the ribbon. tears flood down her cheeks as she reads. franklin opens his eyes.}
