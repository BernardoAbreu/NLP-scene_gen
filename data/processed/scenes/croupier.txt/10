<L>__{interior phone booth day}
<A>__{stubbing out his cigarette, jack sr. leaves the booth. we now see where he is. a beach bar in south africa. he walks to the bar and....goes behind it, slipping on his barman's jacket. a woman in dark mirror glasses and a bathing suit is waiting.}
<C>__{jack sr.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{sorry to keep you. what'll you have?}
<L>__{interior jack's sitting room day}
<A>__{jack, disturbed by the call, pours himself a vodka. he looks at what he's written: 'the ball... a novel by... jack manfred.'}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{jack knew something was wrong. he'd forgotten giles' advice. giles said three words.}
<A>__{jack inserts a word in the title. it now reads: 'on the ball'. jack drinks. after a moment...}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{jack's voice no. jack knew it still wasn't quite right...}
<A>__{he types: 'in the balls'. then, on reflection, deletes 'in the'. through the iron bars jack watches feet pass on the street above. a drunk drops a beer can over. the can falls in slow motion but the clatter is loud.}
<C>__{drunk's voice}
<D>__{i want to fuck the whole world over.}
