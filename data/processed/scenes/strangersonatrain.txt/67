<A>__{bruno is stretched out on a settee. he is completely out. his collar and tie are open. two or three of the male guests are just leaving the room. the senator remains behind for a moment with guy.}
<C>__{senator}
<D>__{i thought he was a bit weird when he arrived. who is he?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i hardly know him, sir.}
<C>__{senator}
<D>__{get him out of here as soon as you decently can will you. this is a nice item for the gossips. first thing you know, they'll be talking about orgies. i'd better get back...}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{the senator leaves. guy stands over bruno's outstretched figure.}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{bruno is now half awake. almost without seeing guy, he staggers to his feet and begins to make his way to the door. guy advances, and with a sharp thrust, pushes bruno back on the settee. bruno looks and sees guy clearly for the first time.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{what happened? i was on a merry go round somewhere. it made me dizzy.}
<A>__{guy moves forward, and thrusting his hand in bruno's open shirt, pulls him to his feet. bruno ignores guy's violence and remain puzzled.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{you're a mad, crazy maniac, and you ought to be locked up! now will you get out of here and let me alone?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{but, guy }
<A>__{guy smashes bruno in the jaw, in utter disgust, and knocks him back onto the settee. bruno looks up from his sprawled position, a dull look in his eye.}

<D>__{you shouldn't have done that, guy.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(subsiding)}
<D>__{come on pull yourself together. do your tie up.}
<A>__{bruno staggers to his feet. he fumbles at his collar. as he crosses to him, camera moves in to a closer shot.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{here let me.}
<A>__{he fixes bruno's shirt and collar together and quickly ties his white bow. bruno stands swaying like a small boy as guy does this. camera pans with them as guy starts to escort bruno from the room.}

<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(mumbling)}
