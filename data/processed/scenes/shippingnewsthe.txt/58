<A>__{quoyle exits the house, pulling on his jacket, and... ...stops. something laid across his threshold. a long piece of twine has been placed there. knots tied evenly along its length. he glances back up to the second floor, thinking bunny. looks at the thing again. neat work. odd. slips it in his pocket.}
<L>__{exterior cliffside day}
<A>__{quoyle now making his way down a steep primitive trail through lush vegetation. the green house is far above him. the shimmering bay now just below. this way down as treacherous as it is wondrous, and quoyle slips in the tangle and wet, half slides through wild angelica stalks and patches of dogberry, suddenly... ...losing his balance, tumbling roughly down a stretch, rolling, grasping a spruce trunk. pulling himself to his feet, he hears... rustling. looks up, just as... ...a white dog appears through the bushes. red eyes. lips curled back. a frozen second of mutual indecision, and quoyle... ...screams and falls on his butt. the dog... ...takes off, bounding down a path we hadn't noticed. toward an upright silhouette. who steps into sun just long enough to become... ...a man, grizzled and scrawny and quick. gone in a flash. like a skinny ghost. and there, on his butt... ...quoyle laughs softly. how 'bout that? murmurs...}

<A>__{as he climbs to his feet, he sees the rocky beach just below. squints, as if at something that doesn't belong. we see it now... ...a suitcase, washed up onto a tangle of rocks, just offshore. angle...quoyle wading into the water. up to his knees, slips, sinks to his waist. stays upright. snatches the suitcase from its perch. brings it back to shore, holding it high. already, he is making the face of someone smelling something he'd rather not. he sets it down. the face is worse. his curiosity running the show, he unhooks the latch... ...and stops. because he's staring inside. suddenly, he screams and flails back, his leg striking the case, and out tumbles onto the wet ground... ...the head. of bayonet melville.}
