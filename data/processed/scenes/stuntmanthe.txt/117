<A>__{involuntarily smiling to himself and now less uptight about last night, he walks over and sits down beside her.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{how they get the film developed so fast?}
<A>__{without even glancing at him, nina gets up and moves to a chair some distance away. he is stunned, then angry. then confounded. then resigned to the ways of women, he goes over and sits beside her.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(turning on him)}
<D>__{don't let the fact that eli treats you as an equal go to your head. you're not!}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{eli's voice}
<D>__{nina, we're watching dailies.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i'm sorry, eli.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{but he can say anything and that's okay...}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{...that's right...}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{...that's great...}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{...what goes on in that dim little head of yours? how dare you open your mouth to him like that? have you the vaguest idea what he's trying to say to people with this film?!...that man is the most dedicated, kindest...!}
<A>__{eli's voice interrupts, angry, like a schoolteacher dismissing a child for talking.}
<C>__{eli's voice}
<D>__{nina, you can go now.}
<A>__{nina, close to tears, quickly gets up and hurries out of the theater, as cameron sits there numbly staring at the screen.}
