<L>__{exterior lamarque's house, paris day}
<A>__{the carriage has reached an arch into a courtyard where a crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of sickness. the carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch what is going on. the street is padded with straw. many eyes gaze up at the draped windows. people cross themselves. a priest is seen hurrying into the house, accompanied by two altar boys. gavroche jumps off as the carriage stops and joins the crowd. the crowd is made up of citizens of paris, student revolutionaries, the poor and beggars. the students hand out printed leaflets and try to excite the crowd.}
