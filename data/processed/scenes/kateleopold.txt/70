<C>__{kate}

<A>__{they move to dr. kau's area.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(to dr. kau)}
<D>__{how are you proceeding?}
<A>__{dr. kau merely grunts. leopold looks at kate.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{don't take it personally. once dr. kau starts working, you just have to wait until her batteries run down. we're all pretty much like that.}
<A>__{they head into kate's office.}
