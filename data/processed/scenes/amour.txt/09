<L>__{interior apartment night}
<B>__{silence}
<A>__{we see wide shots of the apartment. the hallway. the bedroom. the living room. the dining room. the kitchen. nobody in sight.}
<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{eva, around 50, has come to pay a visit. anne isn't there.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{you know how he is. once he's got something into his head, he has to go through with it. in the end, everybody was delighted. and besides, it didn't hurt our financial situation. we're playing until the 28th.}
<C>__{eva }
<D>__{then we have 10 days to rest, then we go to stockholm for four days, and then to kumo in finland. heaven knows where that is. at the north pole. but geoff's already been there few times, and he loves it. we're playing the "dowland transcriptions" there and then we're back in london.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what about the children?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{liz is at boarding school and john is living his own life. he's twenty six years old.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what does he do?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{he's a student. we rarely see him. he's got his own ideas. life geoff. they don't really get along. geoff wants to advise him on everything, and john doesn't like that at all.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{is he good?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i think so. he's less impulsive. very industrious.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{that sounds rather derogatory.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{no!! he's not like geoff. quiet, but stubborn. i think he'll do all right. at the last conservatory concert, he played the solo part in the haydn concerto. it was very good. geoff was there and congratulated him at the end.}
<A>__{brief pause.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{and you?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{did you both make up?}
<C>__{eva}
<P>__{(with a little laugh)}
<D>__{my god, you know him, don't you? over the winter, he suddenly discovered his passion for a viola player who'd been in our ensemble for years. what can i tell you? it was a huge drama, and the poor little darling wound up trying to commit suicide. that scared him and he came back to me in full remorse. i've got used to it now. what's a bit embarrassing is that the ensemble, you can't keep any secrets from anyone.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{do you love him?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{yes, i think so.}
<A>__{brief pause.}
<C>__{eva }
<D>__{what's aphasia?}
<A>__{georges gestures that it's too complicated.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what can i say? the carotid artery was blocked. they did an ultrasound scan, two in fact, and they said they had to operate on her. she was scared. she was confused and scared. you know she has always been afraid of doctors. they said the risk was very low and that if they didn't operate, she'd be certain to have a serious stroke.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{and what do they say now?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{just that it didn't go well. it's one of the 5% that go wrong.}
<A>__{he yawns.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{it's pretty upsetting.}
<A>__{he looks at his watch.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{usually at this time, i take a nap. my blood sugar is somewhere down in my socks.}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{yeah.}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{what can i do for you?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{nothing. it was nice of you to come despite all of your stress.}
<A>__{brief pause. she doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{no, really. there's nothing you can do. we'll see how things go when she's back here in the apartment. we'll manage. maybe i will get a caretaker in, or maybe i will manage on my own. we'll see. we've been through quite a lot in our time, your mother and i.}
<P>__{(little laugh)}
<D>__{all this is still a bit new.}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{eva}
<P>__{(with a little laugh)}
<D>__{it's funny. i don't know if i should say it. maybe it'll embarrass you. but when i came here a short while ago, i suddenly remembered how i always used to listen to the two of you making love when i was little.}
<C>__{eva }
<D>__{for me, at the time, it was reassuring. it gave me a feeling that you loved each other, and that we'd always be together.}
