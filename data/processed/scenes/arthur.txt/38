<L>__{interior restaurant night}
<A>__{a very precise french waiter performs the specials menu with ludicrous elan. susan is rapt, taking it all very seriously.}
<C>__{waiter }
<D>__{...the chef has bathed the bass in a parceline of chilean fennel and finished him with a little gift of kobe beef. also i have a progressive tasting of kumamoto oysters en gelee which evolve on the palate, from light and refreshing to complex and spicy. a short story with a twist at the end! le fin.}
<A>__{susan chuckles approvingly, knowingly, the twit. she coos with delight and claps in appreciation.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{do you have something with less words please? the chef doesn't have to re cook it, just scrape off the nouns and trim out all that gibberish in the middle.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{he's just joshing, dominic. i will do the skate in wood ear mushroom.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{excellent decision. sir?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{a bowl of champagne and a spoon.}
<A>__{the waiter leaves, despising arthur.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{arthur, did you really have to be so icky to dominic?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i just can't handle the whole specials act. it's not a shakespearean soliloquy, it's some heated up dead things that aren't on the main menu.}
<A>__{a wine waiter slams a bowl and spoon next to arthur. he pours in champagne.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you know, i was grumbling to your mother about how things are with us sometimes. how i'm sure you're trying to drive me away...}
<A>__{arthur slurps his champagne.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{um hm.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{but she was explaining that relationships are like property purchases; invest only in high end stock, avoid anyone 'up and coming', then hold onto the property through thick and thin to deliver maximum return! isn't that darling?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{is it possible to buy the house but then rent it out? sorry, joke. i'm not suggesting pimping you.}
<A>__{arthur sees a very frail, rich old woman dripping in diamonds, passing by on her walking frame.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{look. you after our first child is born.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{arthur. why can't you learn to laugh at genuinely amusing things?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{such as?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{youtube clips of babies giggling. dane cook.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{susan. why are we together?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i love you, arthur. and you love me, whatever you think.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{we don't have the same sense of humour. we don't like the same films, food, music. you like horses, i think they're arrogant idiots...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{don't they say opposites attract?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{that depends on the opposites. racists and the nation of islam don't secretly want to 69 each other. susan, you're beautiful. you're bright. you're fucking loaded. is there really no one else who could make you happy?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{never?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{well, i had a thing at college. that was serious for a while. but daddy...}
<A>__{she stops herself.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{daddy what? prayed to jesus for it not to work out, then shot the bloke behind a meat truck? because jesus would consider that cheating.}
<A>__{susan places her hand on arthur's.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{ask me, arthur.}
<A>__{arthur takes susan's hand.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{susan. you're the only woman...at this table.}
<A>__{a waiter tops up susan's wine. arthur, now very drunk, holds out his champagne bowl to be refilled.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you're not happy, arthur. nobody who drinks like you can be happy.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{how do you know? what if the drunker i get the better it is for me? not everyone who drinks is a poet, susan. some of us drink because we're not poets.}
<A>__{the waiter arrives with susan's fish and arthur's drink.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{a real woman could stop you from drinking.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{it'd have to be a real big woman.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{ask me, arthur.}
<A>__{arthur sinks to his knees. susan waits...and waits. arthur has passed out. susan kicks him awake. he fumbles away in the gloom, getting out the ring box and trying to get it on her finger. at table level, susan waits, irritated.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{all done.}
<A>__{susan pulls her hand up, and gazes at the huge, glinting diamond pushed onto the end of her thumb.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{susan. would you marry me? take the weekend if you want...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{yes, i will marry you.}
<A>__{she nods imperceptibly at the waiter.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{ladies and gentleman the happy couple!}
<A>__{music starts. a congratulatory round of applause. confetti is thrown. the whole restaurant cheers. susan whips out her blackberry and starts hitting keys.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{erica will be the planner.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{erica? she hates me.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{who i love, she loves.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{oh, come on. she always looks like she wants to set fire to my face then put it out with an uzi.}
<A>__{susan's phone rings.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(answering)}
<D>__{hello...thanks, daddy! sorry, hang on, i have erica calling...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what's going on? i only just bloody proposed!}
<A>__{arthur's phone rings. the caller i.d reads `vivienne'. he kills the call and sits, horrified, as the entire restaurant celebrates his grim fate.}
