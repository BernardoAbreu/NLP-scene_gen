<P>__{(barely looking up)}
<D>__{what a bloody flap, eh? i heard from alexandria this morning apparently no one there is accepting british pounds. and if you pick up a telephone everybody's practicing their german.}
<P>__{(holds up some gramophone records)}
<D>__{what do you do do you take these things?}
<P>__{(then, awkward)}
<D>__{look, moose, we need you to stay in tobruk. a bit of a short straw but the thinking is we'll be back i mean, we will be back but...and in the interim we need eyes and ears on the ground.}
<A>__{a big bomb lands nearby. the building shudders and plaster dust drops from the ceiling. almost oblivious, the two men head out of the office. fenelon barnes lugs the trunk last glimpsed in his tent by almasy, until caravaggio takes over.}
