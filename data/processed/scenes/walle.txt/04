<L>__{exterior avenue of trash}
<A>__{"...beneath your parasol the world is all a smile..." something moving on the ground far below. a figure at the foot of a trash heap. a small service robot diligently cubing trash. rusted, ancient. cute. every inch of him engineered for trash compacting. mini shovel hands collect junk. scoop it into his open chassis. his front plate closes slowly, compressing waste. a faded label on his corroded chest plate: "waste allocation loader earth class" (wall e) wall e spits out a cube of trash. stacks it with the others. something catches his eye. tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack. a hubcap. the sun reflects off it. wall e checks the sky.}
<B>__{on trash heap horizon}
<A>__{the sun sets through the smoggy haze. "...and we won't come back until we've kissed a girl " he places the hubcap in his compactor. presses a button on his chest. the song stops playing. the end of a work day. wall e attaches a lunch cooler to his back. whistles for his pet cockroach. the insect hops on his shoulder. they motor down from the top of a giant trash tower.}
