<D>__{he's singing classic music to keep his spirits up.}
<A>__{the tech looks at him curiously.}
<C>__{schlissel}

<D>__{you know, i don't care if i weigh 60 pounds on mars. i am one tired doggie.}

<A>__{burchenal kicks at it again. gives. he takes out the entrenching tool, hacks at it. knocks a piece free.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{let's dig a snow cave or we're gonna fucking die.}
<A>__{he starts to wail on it. gallagher staggers over and joins him. the two of them start to flail away like a cross between prehistoric man and giant beavers, desperate as }
