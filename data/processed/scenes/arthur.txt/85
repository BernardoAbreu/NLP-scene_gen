<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{dance?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{arthur. we've been through this. call that cab please.}
<A>__{arthur looks down into her eyes and hits `play' on his iphone. music starts: it's not a slow, smoochy song but big, brassy and upbeat. music: `nellie the elephant' by mandy miller arthur ballroom dances naomi at speed around the room.}
<C>__{mandy miller}
<D>__{to bombay, a travelling circus came, they brought an intelligent elephant and nellie was her name...}
<C>__{naomi}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{what the bejeezus is this?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{hobson used to sing it to me.}
<P>__{(singing along)}
<D>__{one dark night, she slipped her iron chain. off she ran to hindustan and was never seen again. nellie the elephant packed her bags, and said goodbye to the circus, off she went with a trumpety trump, trump trump trump...}
<A>__{it's energetic, wonderful, as romantic as any slow dance. they stop dancing. arthur stares at naomi. at last, they kiss. but the music stops. it's vivienne.}
<C>__{vivienne}
<D>__{is this the tour guide?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{she's a writer.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{is this the vivienne?}
<C>__{vivienne}
<D>__{crowded field, writing.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{maybe someone will see her potential.}
<C>__{vivienne}
<D>__{we all know who's seen her potential.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{meaning?}
<C>__{vivienne}
<D>__{oh, of course, you don't know, do you?}
<A>__{arthur suddenly goes pale.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{vivienne, please. don't...}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{what is going on here?}
<C>__{vivienne}
<D>__{my son became fond of you. you're not the first. or the last, i imagine. anyway i was scanning his monthly expenses which always makes for entertaining reading, all those gifts for all those girls and found he'd bought an entire publishing company called...what was it now? rainbow press.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{you bought rainbow press? so you could tell them to publish my book?}
<C>__{vivienne}
<D>__{he knows people, dear. i'm sure you do too, though the people you know tend not to own books, let alone publishers. arthur, i trust we'll see you back at the party? susan's a little worried.}
<A>__{vivienne leaves. naomi storms away. arthur chases.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{naomi! please! i didn't think i would ever see you again. i was just trying to give you some...}
<C>__{naomi}
<P>__{(gasps)}
<D>__{confidence? self esteem isn't a gift, arthur! it isn't a fur coat or a thousand billion orchids or an apartment made from truffles or whatever else you rich freaks use to express love!}
<A>__{arthur looks incredibly hurt.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i do express love! i love you!}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{don't say that!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you just told me to! and stop going on about me being rich! you think it's easy being trapped by money?}
<A>__{naomi gets her old phone out. she speaks into it.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{hello, amnesty? come quick! arthur's being held against his will in guantamoney bay!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{abu greed?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{stop riffing with me! how dare you do what you did. i didn't need your money to feel good about myself!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{no. being cheap gives you that.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{at least i'm prepared to have fun. to live. i'm not all `oooh look at me with my antique food, aren't i cool?' and...and...your phone's rubbish! it's made of bits of old doorbell and vibrator, i bet you can only get calls from 1994 on it!}
<C>__{naomi}
<P>__{(boils over)}
<D>__{as long as i don't get any from a drunk, rich fuck up like you!}
<A>__{a door opens.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{hello? i heard shouting.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{i'm an employee of arthur's. i came to complain about the conditions.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{naomi, please...}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{mr bach templemead, i know you thought putting half and half in the staff kitchen was an improvement.}
<P>__{(really angry)}
<D>__{but some people prefer coffee mate! you were disrespectful. i quit!}
<A>__{naomi walks away, slamming a door behind her.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{because you changed the creamer?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{arthur, marty called from the hospital.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{it's okay, hobson's fine. i spoke to her doctor.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{apparently you didn't.}
