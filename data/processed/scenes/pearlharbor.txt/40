<L>__{exterior pearl harbor air base barracks day}
<A>__{danny walker and his pilot buddies have just arrived; they enter the barracks, talking happily.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{if i ain't n never on a b boat again, it'll be too s soon.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{where are the women on this }
<A>__{danny has stopped before the others; now all of them see that the other pilots who inhabit this air base are still in their beds, sleeping off hangovers. they wear hawaiian shirts; they haven't shaved.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{they're s still asleep!}
<A>__{danny pauses for a moment, then shouts }
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{drop your cocks and grab your socks, boys! the terror of the skies are here!}
<A>__{the sleeping pilots groan, and cover their heads with their pillows.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{they're all drunk.}
<A>__{one guy sits up in bed, his hair pointing every direction of the compass, his tongue working as if to wipe a terrible taste from his mouth. as his feet dangle over the side of the bunk and one of them touches the floor, a sensation reaches his sotted brain; he raises that foot to look at its bottom, and finds a new tattoo, on the sole of his foot; he blinks as if trying to remember how it got there. danny moves over to him, and dubs him with a name, coma.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{hey. you. mr. coma.}
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{where's that lizard?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what lizard?}
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{the one that slept in my mouth last night.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what the hell happened to you guys?}
<A>__{coma is one of those drunks who speak as if he's always about to burp.}
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{ever hear of mai tai's? comes in a big...pot. like...like...}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{a m missionary?}
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{no, like...}
<A>__{coma emits a pukey, toxic burp that has danny and his buddies wincing back from the fumes.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{this is an air base? where's your squad commander?}
<A>__{the question soaks through to coma's brain. his right hand points...and his left hand points...in different directions. his hands float around in the air until finally both of them are indicating the same direction, behind his back. in the bunk beyond coma's is another drunk pilot in a hawaiian shirt...and to judge by the shapely bronzed leg that protrudes from under his damp sheet, there's a woman with him too. danny and his buddies are speechless except for red strange.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i th think i'm gonna like it here.}
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{you guys are new?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{coma}
<D>__{mai tai's. i got this to tell ya, about mai tai's.}
<A>__{coma's head drifts forward slowly; they think for a moment he's looking for something under the bed. then he pukes. danny leaps back from the splatter, and marches out of the barracks; his friends follow.}
