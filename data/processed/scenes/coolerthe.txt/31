<L>__{interior moonlighter coffee shop day}
<A>__{bernie and natalie sit eating breakfast.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{after i get out, i call up shelly and he tells me to come out here. i figure he's going to set me up good at the shangri la. but he tells me they got all these rules about casinos employing felons. so he gets me this gig doing telemarketing for one of their fronts trying to scam pensioners out of their retirement money. i lasted two weeks.}
<A>__{as bernie talks, natalie spies a very pregnant girl (20's) coming out of the restroom. her eyes follow the girl back to a table where a young man (20's) waits on her.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{already, i was getting in deep. finally it got so bad, i had to beg shelly to take on my markers around town. that just bought me more time to keep losing. i put shelly in an awkward position. i understand why he did what he did.}
<P>__{(taps his knee)}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{he did that to you? what, he shot you?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{baseball bat.}
<P>__{(off her cringing expression)}
<D>__{i got off easy.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{that's getting off easy?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{i was out of control.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{but he maimed you...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{let me tell you something. i'm grateful for what he did.}
<P>__{(off her stunned look)}
<D>__{no kidding. every time i get an urge to play off the clock to so much as drop a quarter in a slot i reach down and squeeze what's left of my cartilage. it's one helluva reminder.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{jesus... i thought stuff like that didn't happen no more. like that was just in the movies or something.}
<A>__{bernie holds her gaze her for a moment.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{anyway, shelly and i worked out a payment plan. two years off the books at the shangri la, cooling tables. five more days and i walk.}
<A>__{before natalie can respond, we hear the pregnant girl start to moan out loud. the waitress rushes over.}
<C>__{pregnant girl}
<P>__{(clutching her belly)}
<D>__{oh shit, i think i'm going into labor!}
<A>__{the young man at the table rushes her to her feet, escorts her toward the exit in a dramatic fashion. all this without paying the bill. as they pass by bernie and natalie's table, the girl trips over natalie's purse. bernie quickly helps her up. that's when he notices the young man...}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{mikey?}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{bernie...}
<A>__{there's a quick moment of confusion. bernie feels a bit thrown by it all.}
