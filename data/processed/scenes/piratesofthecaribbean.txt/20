<L>__{interior blacksmith's forge night}
<A>__{will, shirtless, wearing a leather apron, heats an iron ingot at the furnace, hammers it flat he stops. his attention is drawn to the window. he opens the shutter and peers out nothing but fog. almost without noticing, he reaches for a boarding axe hanging on the wall. takes it down; it has a satisfying weight in his hands.}
<L>__{interior cell block night}
<A>__{close on: a mutt of a dog, holding a ring of keys in his mouth. three seedy looking prisoners try to coax the dog to their cell door. one holds a loop of rope; another waggles a bone. the dog just sits and cocks its head.}
<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{come here, boy... want a nice, juicy bone?}
<A>__{in an adjoining cell, jack lies on a pile of straw.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you can keep doing that forever, that dog's never going to move.}
<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{excuse us if we ain't resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet.}
