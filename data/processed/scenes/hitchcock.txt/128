<L>__{exterior hitchcock house night}
<A>__{a full moon. the only light from inside the house is the one in the kitchen. we glimpse the figure in the window. a corpulent man in profile, like a hopper painting.}
<L>__{interior hitchcock house, kitchen later}
<A>__{hitch sits in his nightgown, pushing some vegetables around his plate his healthy midnight snack. alma enters in her robe. hitch watches her. she goes to the fridge, opens the produce drawer and from under the brussel sprouts pulls out a tiny hidden jar of beluga caviar. she gets the crackers, a plate and a spoon and sits down at the table next to him.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{i don't think i can stand both of us being maudlin.}
<A>__{she fixes several crackers, each with an appropriate dollop of caviar on top, and puts the plate in the middle.}
<C>__{alma }
<D>__{there is one solution to all this, you know.}
<A>__{she offers him one of the crackers.}
<C>__{alma }
<D>__{we could both get to work together.}
<A>__{tentatively, hitch accepts it.}
<C>__{alma }
<D>__{that tiresome little hitchcock imitation i've been helping whit finish is done.}
<A>__{hitch remains quiet, delicately consuming his cracker.}
<C>__{alma }
<D>__{so i suggest, for everyone's sake, we start whipping psycho into shape tomorrow. you may not be the easiest man to live with but you know how to cut a picture better than anyone.}
<A>__{hitch puts the lid back on the caviar.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{except for you.}
