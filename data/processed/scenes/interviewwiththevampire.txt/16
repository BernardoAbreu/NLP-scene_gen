<L>__{exterior cemetery night}
<A>__{louis stops again in front of the crypt. drinks from the flask, leans his forehead against the stone. lestat appears beside him, radiant, beautiful.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you really want to be with them?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yes. kill me. kill me like you promised }
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you asked for death. i didn't promise it }
<A>__{in a quiet rage, lestat raise his fist and shatters the marble face stone, revealing a coffin below. his fist shatters that in turn, revealing the half rotted body of a women, holding an infant, no longer recognizable as individuals, a tangle of gruesome rotted hair, flesh, eaten away lace, insects and worms crawling over it. louis gasps.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{it's not your wife and child my friend. it's death. just that simple. think and choose. it happens to everyone. except us.}
<A>__{lestat stares at him, smiling, becoming a hazy dreamlike vision, then hyperclear. louis again is spellbound. he drops the flask, which shatters on the stones. lestat appears angelic in his radiance.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{we shall be this way always, my friend. young as we are now. i'm lonely for a companion, lonely for your strength. but i'm not that lonely. do you want to come or not?}
<A>__{louis capitulates in one long sigh.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yes...}
<A>__{lestat comes closer, smiling.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{did i hear a yes?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yes...}
<A>__{lestat embraces louis, obscuring his face. he drinks his blood. we hear two heartbeats, out of sync, coming together. we see louis' face, growing paler, paler, as his blood is drained. his eyes stare upwards, losing their focus. louis' pov the moon, through hanging vines. the marble statue of his wife and child smile at him, as if come alive. her hair blows in the breeze, wonderful gold tresses, the child's fingers reach out...}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{lestat lets louis fall down beside the broken crypt. louis looks from the rotting bodies to lestat above him. radiant. lestat speaks gently.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i've drained you to the point of death. if you drink from me you live for ever. if i leave you here you die.}
<A>__{lestat lifts his hand to his lips and blows louis a kiss.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{no. don't leave me here. give it to me.}
<A>__{lestat lifts his own right wrist to his teeth. fangs slash his own flesh, blood falls.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you're sure?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{sure...}
<A>__{louis rises to accept the first drops with his open mouth. lestat gathers him up, as louis clamps his hand on lestat's arm and drinks from the wrist. the vampire theme swells. lestat watches him drink his wrist with wry amusement. louis finishes, staggers away from him as if drunk. louis' pov vampire vision. the world is transformed, the swamp, the moon, the clouds, the cry of the night birds all come to him with unnatural clarity. he looks down with pity at the corpses of his wife and child who appear beautiful in death now rather than repulsive. he closes the lid of the coffin and replaces it in the ground, astonished at the ease of it. he turns and stares at lestat whom he sees now with vampire's vision. lestat's eyes are brighter, his buttons are glimmering in the light. everything is clearer, brighter, containing more facets of light and color.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{stop staring at my buttons. didn't i tell you it was going to be fun?}
<A>__{lestat leads him into the swamp. everything astonished louis, as if he's never seen it before. louis is suddenly racked by shudders of pain.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you're body's dying. pay no attention. it will take twenty minutes at most.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{dying?}
<A>__{louis dry retches.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{it happens to us all.}
<A>__{lestat wipes louis' brow.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{come, you're going to feed now.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i want a woman.}
<A>__{lestat laughs and his laughter echoes like bells in louis' ears.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{that doesn't matter anymore, louis. you'll see. come...}
<A>__{louis' vampire pov swamp small high ground. camp of runaway slaves. several share a bottle of rum around the fire. a male slave rises. a gorgeous hunk of flesh in the moonlight and goes into the swamp to relieve his bladder.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{they're all beautiful now. men, women, the old, the young...simply because they are alive. }
<A>__{the slave walks towards them in the darkness. a crucifix gleams round his neck.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{take him.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{the crucifix }
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{forget the crucifix. take him.}
<A>__{louis hesitates.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{resist no more louis. feed...}
<A>__{the slave looks up and sees them. two gleaming white beings standing before him with devil's eyes. the he runs. louis can resist him no more. he swoops on him with a vampire's rapid movement, brings him to the ground and sinks his teeth in his neck. close on louis feeding on the slave, the magnificent body shuddering in its death throes. lestat stands above, laughing. the slave dies. louis rises from him, drunkenly, engorged with blood.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what have i done?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you have fed. you were made for this...}
<A>__{louis looks down at the body of the slave. lestat's laughter echoes around him.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{dear god, what have i done?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you've killed louis. and enjoyed it.}
<A>__{lestat laughs harder. louis runs from him, screaming in anguish.}
