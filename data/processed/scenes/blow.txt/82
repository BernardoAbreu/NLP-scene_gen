<L>__{exterior logan airport payphones continuous}
<A>__{george moves to the payphones, sets down the two suitcases, and pretends to make a call. not inconspicuously, cesar grabs the bags and walks quickly out of the terminal.}
<L>__{interior basseterre hotel antigua 1976 day}
<A>__{diego, cesar, george and jack stevens, a silver haired executive type, lounge around the mini suite. cesar still has that crazy look in his eye.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{three hundred kilos it is, then.}
<A>__{a beautiful latin woman enters and kisses both diego and cesar. her name is inez, and friendly she is not.}
<C>__{diego }
<D>__{has everyone met inez? this is george. i've told you about him. and this is friend, jack stevens.}
<A>__{the men proffer their hands, but she just looks at them like ants before sitting down next to diego.}
<C>__{diego }
<D>__{try to be more respectful, darling. my apologies. but she is mistrustful of americans. shall we proceed? let's hear it again, mr. stevens.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{i will fly down on a friday, refuel in the bahamas, and then to medellin.}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{friday?}
<A>__{inez addresses diego and cesar only. she speaks in spanish. the conversation is about "why friday?" inez has some problem with it. diego explains. and inez is reassured.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{please, continue.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{we make the pick up, refuel once more in the bahamas, and fly back on sunday with the mom and pop traffic.}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{why are you speaking?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{you. your responsibility is over. you do not fly. you are not a pilot. you are not a distributor. you introduced us to mr. stevens and the use of his airplane. that is all. you make a percentage. a generous one. and you're lucky to get that.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i see. how much?}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{padrino will pay ten thousand per kilo. for everyone. for you, and you, and you.}
<A>__{he indicates george, diego and jack stevens.}
<C>__{cesar }
<D>__{there is no negotiation. three million dollars. that is all.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{i want two.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{gee, jack, a million each had such a nice ring to it.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{no way. i'm doing all the work. taking all the risk, and it's my plane.}
<A>__{diego and george look at each other.}
<C>__{stevens }
<D>__{hey, you guys don't have to do shit. just sit back and collect your money.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you good with this?}
<A>__{diego nods.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{alright.}
<A>__{this is too much for inez to handle. she starts screaming machine gun spanish. something about a "lousy two hundred and fifty thousand dollars," and how diego is "such a coward" to give away all his money. diego is embarrassed but tries to remain calm.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{you will watch what you say. especially around george. he is my brother and he speaks as good spanish as you.}
<A>__{but inez is wild. she starts in again, a log of "putos (sob's)", and "cojones" and "maricones (gay sissys)." even cesar is uncomfortable. diego stands.}
<C>__{diego }
<D>__{okay. that's enough.}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{get your hands off me.}
<A>__{inez takes a swing at diego and catches him full across the face. time stops in the room. question. what will diego do? answer: smack! diego swings back and a full scale is on. cesar continues the conversation. it's surreal. as if diego and inez weren't beating the shit out of each other right in front of them.}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{do you have pictures of your kids?}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{i will need to see them. also need their names and the names of their schools. we are trusting you with ninety million dollars worth of coca, mr. stevens. without your children, there is no deal.}
<A>__{stevens thinks about it. kids as collateral. inez and diego are still duking it out. but diego finally gets the upper hand and drags her into the bedroom.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{fine. so if that's all, i will be leaving now.}
<A>__{cesar walks him to the door.}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{don't forget the pictures.}
<A>__{diego calls from the other room.}
<C>__{diego }
<D>__{george. george, come in here.}
