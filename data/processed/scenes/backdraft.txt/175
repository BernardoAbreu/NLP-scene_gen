<A>__{brian climbs up onto stephen's boat. nobody home. he opens the cabin door, goes inside and hits the lights.}
<L>__{interior stephen's boat night}
<A>__{there's cereal bowls in the sink, beer bottles on the table, and a stack of fire department supplies in the corner. his whole body aching with reluctance, brian begins looking through them. solvents, armorall, a small specialty can of fire dept. chemicals. there's a label of ingredients on it. way down at the bottom, is trychticholorate. nausea wracks its way through brian.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{oh goddamn it stephen...}
<A>__{footsteps. brian spins around in stone shock as stephen comes into the cabin.}

<C>__{brian}
<D>__{look, stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other }
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{ okay, so you don't like me. you don't like everything i've done. what, because i wasn't such a genius the way i raised you? jesus christ, dad was gone, what was i supposed to do? you tell me, what the fuck was i supposed to do?!}
<A>__{he kicks the bulkhead wall.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{it's okay, stephen, i }
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{ i tried, y'know? helen's right. i don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, i've got some.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe i shouldn't have gotten in the way. i'm your brother, not your father. go on. you gotta go somewhere? go...}
<A>__{brian turns to leave. pauses.}
<C>__{brian}

<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i saw it before it got them. i tried to yell, but... he asked me to look out for him. and i didn't do it. i let him die.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{...jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? for christ's sake, you were seven years old! you think he could have heard you in there?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i hate him so much sometimes, stephen. you don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{maybe i do.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{...what a fuckin' mess, huh?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{people can change brian.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{sometimes right when you're looking at them.}
<A>__{brian sees the chemicals in the corner again and something freezes up inside. stephen catches the look and there's horrible silence between them.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{oh god, stephen, what's going on with you?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i don't know, brian... i don't know...}
