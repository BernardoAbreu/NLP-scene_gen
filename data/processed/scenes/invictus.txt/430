<A>__{the springboks say a prayer on the field. pienaar kneels in the middle, leading the prayer. behind them, a work crew assembles a portable podium. at "amen", pienaar's men lift him to his feet, then onto their shoulders. the crowd roars again and again as pienaar takes a victory lap on the shoulders of the men he has led through thick and thin. tears stream down his face, through his unstoppable grin. as they near the podium, the team is intercepted by a news crew and none other then boland botha.}

<D>__{francois ... a few words ...}
<A>__{the interview booms through the pa system. pienaar just nods he isn't about to spoil the moment by reacting to this buffoon.}
<C>__{boland botha}
<D>__{... great game, but i don't think you could've done it without the amazing support of these 63,000 south africans }
<A>__{francois grabs the mike from boland.}

<P>__{(into mike, words booming)}
<D>__{we didn't have the support of 63,000 south africans today. we had the support of 42 million south africans.}

<D>__{they're waiting for you over there.}
<A>__{pienaar turns, looks. mandela waits at the podium, eyes alight with joy. in front of him is the william webb ellis trophy, a big gold confection. their eyes meet. their eyes stay locked as pienaar fights his way through the press, the officials, his own team, to the podium. mandela holds out his hand. pienaar takes it. big hands, one black, one white, one with bruises visible, one with a lifetime of bruises implied. both wearing the number 6 springbok jersey.}

<D>__{francois, i want to thank you most sincerely for what you have done to our country.}
<A>__{pienaar shakes his head.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{mr. president, i want to thank you for what you have done.}
<A>__{eyes lock again, for just a moment, blue eyes, brown eyes african eyes, both. and then pienaar raises the trophy high. a very traditional sports hero's moment, richly deserved. real gold, against the green of the battered field. but that is not the real prize. the prize is what happens next, all over the nation.}
