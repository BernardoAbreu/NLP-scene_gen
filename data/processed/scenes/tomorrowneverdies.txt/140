<A>__{sidney comes out onto a floor still under construction. the elevator doors close behind her. to the right, she sees stamper and a harmsway blazered guard, with machine pistols.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{thank god! he's crazy!}
<C>__{stamper}
<D>__{does he have a gun?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{on stamper's reply }
<C>__{stamper}
<D>__{good }
<A>__{he lunges for her, grabs her, spins her around, overwhelming her. she struggles, yelling:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{this is a mistake!}
<C>__{stamper}
<P>__{(gun against her skull)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{using sidney as a human shield, stamper marches her in front of the closed elevator doors. the guard follows. they position themselves for a massacre. reaching around sidney, stamper pulls out his radio:}
<C>__{stamper }
<D>__{open 14.}
<A>__{a beat. it opens. the men unleash a hail of bullets, then realize new angle (interior elevator) the car is empty. stamper perplexed. pushing sidney in front of him, he enters the elevator, cautiously... when, suddenly: bond swings down out of the escape panel (like an athlete on a high bar) feet first barely clearing sidney's head as he kicks stamper and the guard in their faces. they go flying backwards. bond jumps down, grabs sidney }
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{need a lift?}
<A>__{and boosts her into the escape panel, following her up.}
