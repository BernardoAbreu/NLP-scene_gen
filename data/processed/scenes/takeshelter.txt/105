<L>__{interior storm shelter day}
<A>__{curtis hefts a porcelain toilet down the steps of the shelter. a dull light glows through the new entryway that's been knocked out through the back left wall. curtis goes through it. in the shipping container section, curtis sets the toilet on the floor. he picks up the camping lantern and holds it up to the space. the lack of light makes it feel more cavernous than it is. two cots have been brought down as well as an assortment of supplies. canned food, a small gas burner. curtis hangs the lantern onto a hook on the wall and goes about connecting the toilet to a pipe sticking out of the back corner.}
