<L>__{exterior party boat night}
<A>__{a latin band cuts loose as beautiful people mill about against a beautiful chicago skyline. an air horn blows, and suddenly the skyline is moving. we're on a huge, private party boat.}
<L>__{exterior party boat night}
<A>__{brian's leaning on the boat railing watching the passing parade of rich and beautiful. across the sea of champagne and brie, he spots jennifer talking with her boss, swayzak. he has his hand on her back. jennifer spots brian. she smile, detaches herself and walks over.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(eyes on swayzak)}
<D>__{hey...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so are you dating your boss or what?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{if you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, i'd probably be pissed.}
<P>__{(beat, sighs)}
<D>__{boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{sorry.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you dating anyone?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you think that's really any of your business?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{well, you did invite me here.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{marty did.}
<P>__{(beat, smiles)}
<D>__{but i wanted you to come to.}
<A>__{swayzak suddenly appears with his entourage.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{mr. mccaffrey...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{nice boat.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{it isn't mine.}
<P>__{(to photographer)}
<D>__{let's get a picture.}
<A>__{swayzak swings around and puts his arm cheesily around brian's shoulder. another staffer slaps a swayzak for mayor sticker to brian's lapel. jennifer rolls her eyes to brian. i'm sorry... snap.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<P>__{(seeing someone else)}
<D>__{larry!}
<P>__{(sotto to jennifer)}
<D>__{what does he do again?}
<A>__{swayzak leads her off in pursuit. left alone, brian turns to the railing, stares off at the passing city. you can hear the wind up of a siren. and there it is now, an engine company zooming along wacker drive. something digs and kicks inside of brian as he watches it disappear.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{how's the job going?}
<A>__{she's appeared again beside him.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{boy, rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{no, he's more of a dinosaur. guy's not a dummy, though. he's juggling alot of balls on this one.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{yeah, but it doesn't take albert einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{jesus, give him a break. there isn't enough proof yet to go public. sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. not 'till it's locked.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{but rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{in a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.}
<A>__{bamm! both of them look up sharply. a woman drunk out of her mind has tipped over in her chair. she laughs, her fellow tablemates laugh, everybody laughs. jennifer takes brian by the arm in the opposite direction and smiles.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{save me.}
