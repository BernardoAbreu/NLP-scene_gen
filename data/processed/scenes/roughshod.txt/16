<L>__{exterior forster camp day}
<A>__{med. shot. graham hurries through the trees to stop in horror near the dead men. then very slowly he moves forward to the smouldering fire. stooping he lifts forster's arm away from the fire, then picks up one of the prison coats and looks at it.}
<T>__{dissolve:}
<L>__{exterior desert road day}
<A>__{med. long shot. the surrounding hills are covered with scrub pinon pine and mesquite. graham's buckboard, moving slowly up a hill, passes camera, which pans with it. in the bed, covered by a tarp, are the three bodies. the narrow, one way road climbs easily up the gentle hill. beyond, a dust cloud rises. as graham's buckboard nears the crest, a surrey appears and starts down. graham pulls his team into the bank, trying to make room for the surrey.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{there are four women in the two seated surrey, which is heavily loaded with trunks, hatboxes, etc. mary wells, the loveliest of the four, is driving. she is more poised, more self assured than the others. her clothes, though a trifle showy, are attractive. she wears a large spectacular hat. helen carter, showier, harder and more cynical, sits beside her. in the seat behind are marcia paine, placid, younger looking than her years, and elaine ross, a striking blonde with a pale haunted face. elaine is obviously ill. mary is riding the brake and holding the team back.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{shooting past graham.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{what in thunderation }
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{wait a minute stop }
<A>__{he jerks on the reins and tries to make room for the surrey. a steep bank is on camera left. on camera right, the road drops off into a gulley. as the surrey comes up mary reins the team in. the women all look frightened. graham, trying to force his team to pull the vehicle up the bank, is too occupied to recognize the women at once. having made just enough room for the surrey, he turns and looks at the women.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{all right }
<P>__{(then surprised)}
<D>__{what are you girls doin' way out here?}
<A>__{mary looks ahead at the narrow road and the canyon to her left.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{until you came along we were going to sonora.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{what do you know about that. did you sell your place?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{not exactly. they decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{can i make it?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{depends on how good you drive.}
<C>__{helen}

<C>__{marcia}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{so am i. come on elaine.}
<A>__{elaine leans back against the cushions and shakes her head.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(flat)}
<D>__{what's the difference if we fall in the canyon.}
<C>__{marcia}
<D>__{don't talk like that.}
<A>__{helen is out on the road now. mary has moved over and graham picks up the reins. marcia gives up and jumps out.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{nothin' to it }
<A>__{he releases the brake.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{ once you know how. trouble is, never was a woman knew how to handle a team. shouldn't let 'em loose on the roads. no disrespect meant, miss wells.}
<A>__{mary isn't listening. she is looking at the road. elaine closes her eyes. helen and marcia scurry back out of the way.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{get up.}
<A>__{adroitly he drives the surrey past.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{featuring buckboard. helen and marcia start along the road past the buckboard. helen stops and looks at its cargo in horror. she grabs marcia's arm. the girls look at each other and hurry after the surrey which has stopped below the buckboard.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{on surrey. graham jumps out.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{there you are. now take it easy and you'll be all right.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{thank you, mr. graham.}
<A>__{helen and marcia hurry up. marcia motions back.}
<C>__{marcia}
<P>__{(aghast)}
<D>__{there's dead men in your wagon!}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{that's right. you had me so busy i forgot }
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{come to think of it you better turn around and drive right back to aspen.}
<A>__{the women exchange glances. elaine is sitting up, her eyes open.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{they were murdered. i found the bodies on alder crick, northeast of here. like i said if i was you, i'd go back, because the men who killed them might be on this road.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{back to what?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{why, back to aspen, where you came from.}
<A>__{as mary speaks, helen pushes marcia into the surrey and climbs up beside mary.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{aspen doesn't want us mr. graham. they threw us out.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(distressed)}
<D>__{they shouldn't have done that.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we tried to point that out. but there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. they said aspen had outgrown us. it's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{i knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.}
<A>__{mary unwraps the reins from the whipstock.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{goodbye and thanks.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i don't like to see you go.}
<A>__{mary releases the brake and the surrey starts rolling forward.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{but that's the way it is. the live ones go out and the dead ones come in.}
<A>__{the surrey starts down the hill. graham looks after it, then turns to go back to the buckboard, camera panning with him.}
