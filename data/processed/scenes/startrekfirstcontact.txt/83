<L>__{interior enterprise corridor}
<A>__{three armored security guards with phaser rifles run into view, hit a control panel on the wall. a giant emergency bulkhead comes slamming down, cutting off the rest of the corridor. the security guards turn to run down the hall, but then there is a high pitched shriek of wrenching metal. they drop to the deck and take combat stances.}
<D>__{guard #1 set phasers to rotating modulation!}
<A>__{they make adjustments to their weapons just as the bulkhead doors explode inward in a blinding flash. the guards shield themselves against the fire and debris... looks up just in time to see the swift and lethal shapes of the borg jumping through the smashed bulkhead, racing down the corridor toward them. the guards fire, and when they do the phaser blasts alternate color red, blue, green, purple, orange a staccato of colors as the phasers shift frequency. the phaser blasts take down a few of the borg... but then we see the distinctive personal forcefields of the other borg begin to compensate, and the phasers no longer affect them.}
<D>__{guard #1 that's it, they've adjusted fall back!}
<A>__{they turn to run but borg phaser fire lances out from the borg soldiers and rips them apart.}
