<L>__{exterior street george day}
<A>__{on his cycle drives up bowmont into jackie's driveway. her car is there. george jumps off his bike, fairly races to the door. it's open and he barges in. he's met by jackie's yorkies who bark furiously, jumping up and down, nipping his pantlegs for attention.}
<C>__{jackie's voice}
<D>__{ just a minute, you're early }
<A>__{jackie comes walking out. she's carrying a large cooking spoon and wears an apron over a travelling outfit, a pantsuit. she's wearing more makeup than usual. she stops when she sees george.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ good afternoon }
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ you've got to leave.}
<A>__{george is not prepared for this.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i've got to leave?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{lester's on his way.}
<A>__{george stares at her then walks past her into the living room. bags are packed, a coat thrown over them. the wire kennel carrying cages for the yorkies are beside the bags. george looks into the kitchen where jackie's been cooking some pasta.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{please, we'll have to talk later }
<C>__{george}
<D>__{look about last night }
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(exasperated but not unkind)}
<D>__{forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when i get back }
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's not okay, i mean we've got to talk now. where are you going?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{look either you leave or i leave because i don't want the two of us here when lester arrives. i just don't }
<A>__{the level of her nervousness has just risen about fifty decibels. there's the sound of a car outside.}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{my god that's him }
<A>__{george looks out the window.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ it's malone's.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's it, then i'm leaving.}
<A>__{with that she tosses the spoon onto an end table and rushes out the door. george starts after her. the dry cleaner comes to the door, stopping george.}
<C>__{cleaner}
<D>__{cleaners.}
<A>__{george has to fumble with jackie's cleaning and keep the dogs contained. he does, tosses the cleaning down and races outside to his bike.}
<B>__{on the street}
<A>__{he sees jackie's car rounding the corner, going up the hill, winding around the curves. george guns his bike and takes off after her. around winding curves george almost sideswipes a car parked on a hairpin turn. jackie's on the curve above him. at the next curve george catches up with her, pulls even to her.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{pull over, pull over!}
<A>__{he threatens to run her into the curb. she stops the car sharply and jumps out.}
<B>__{at the top of the drive}
<A>__{they've reached a cul de sac where there's a parched 'view lot' not built on. yellow october weeds cover it and there's a huge television antenna in its center which sways slightly in an afternoon wind. jackie has run onto the lot, then slows to a walk. she grabs one of the rusty stays of the swaying antennas, stares down below her. her house can be seen from this angle, the malone's truck just pulling away. george comes up to her.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(looking below her)}
<D>__{you're going to kill me.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(turning to him, imploring)}
<D>__{well then what are you trying to do }
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i want to marry you. i want to take care of you and i want your children, and i want you to be my girl. that's all i want. that's all i want out of my life, and it's a lot.}
<A>__{she stares at him in disbelief. she actually clutches her stomach.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{look, i don't know if i will ever make it. i mean i'm a fuckup, but i will take care of you, i will make you happy, i swear to god i will.}
<A>__{jackie doesn't answer. she slowly sinks to the ground. george sinks beside her. her eyes are wet.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{jackie... jackie?... answer me, for god's sake, answer me.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{if you knew how many times i wanted to hear you say that...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{so i'm saying it...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it's too late...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what's too late about it? look, we're not dead, are we? that's the only thing that's too late.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{lester's left felicia. he's taking me to acapulco on the five o'clock flight. he's asked me to marry him.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{so what? you don't love him, do you? answer me.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't know... jackie?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{george now is very near tears himself. what he says now he has to force out of himself, as if it's the biggest secret he holds.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't trust... anyone... but you...}
<A>__{george lets his head fall on her shoulder. she's kneeling, supported by the television aerial, and george cries quietly on her shoulder. she has her arm around him.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{oh my baby...}
<A>__{as she's holding george, and looking down the hill, lester's silver rolls pulls up. lester gets out of the car, goes to the front door.}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{god, there's lester...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{don't go, jackie...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i can't just let him stand by the door...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{don't leave me...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i've got to... i've got to tell him where i am.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i don't know i've got to.}
<A>__{she gets up and hurries over to her car, starts it and goes back down the hill. george sits under the television aerial and watches her car go down the hill, periodically flashing}
