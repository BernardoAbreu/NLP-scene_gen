<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{batman and dick tumble to the pavement. the van knocks over a fire hydrant and stops. dick is already on his feet, ready to charge the van, when batman throws a powerful arm around his waist.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{let me go! let me }
<A>__{the joker steps casually out of the van. two goons with machine guns emerge behind him. pedestrians scream as the goons level their guns at the crowd.}
<C>__{dick }
<D>__{you piece of you motherf }
<A>__{dick is kicking, screaming, clawing, biting. batman has his hands full restraining the kid.}

<P>__{(cackling insanely)}
<D>__{you made me what i am today.}
<A>__{batman cocks his head in puzzlement as distant sirens blare. the joker and his hoods guns still aimed at the crowd back away and race off on foot, vanishing into the night. dick breaks free and bolts after them. batman throws him to the street with a flying tackle. the boy is hysterical.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{he killed my parents! he killed my }
<A>__{batman flinches at the sound of the words. he reaches into his belt and mercifully breaks a knockout capsule under dick's nose.}
