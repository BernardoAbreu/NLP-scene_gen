<C>__{priest}
<P>__{(moved)}
<D>__{will the elements be gone now forever from this place?}
<C>__{kommander}
<D>__{when mankind comes to its senses. we will return.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{knowing mankind as i do, that could take centuries!}
<C>__{kommander}
<D>__{time is of no importance, only life is important.}
<A>__{the priest nods and lowers his eyes. angle on: billy staggering forward, raising his pistol, blinking his eyes to focus.. a mondoshawan puts the fourth element in the case the kommander shuts the case and looks at the priest.}
<C>__{kommander}
<D>__{when evil returns so shall we.}
<C>__{priest}
<P>__{(head lowered)}
<D>__{we will be ready, lord.}
<A>__{billy suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{stop.}
<A>__{billy trips, the gun goes off. he empties the clip. the mondoshawan carrying the case crumples to the ground. the wall immediately begins to close. billy fires wildly, unable to control the powerful kicking gun.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{no!!! don't!!!}
<A>__{the priest rushes billy. the weapon has such a kick to it that billy starts shooting into the air, backs up, then stumbles and knocks himself out. the priest is on the ground, seriously wounded. so is the kommander. the warriors are in a panic.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{hurry, kommander! the wall's closing!!!}
<A>__{the wall continues to close. sand pours in from everywhere. the vast room fills up like an hourglass.}
<C>__{kommander}
<D>__{a mission is a mission, savoia. you'll learn that.}
<A>__{the kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but can't get through it. his armor is too bulky, the opening too small. he manages to get his arm and the case through.}
<C>__{kommander}
<D>__{my apologies to general kroi and my wife..}
<A>__{the wall closes, crushing his arm. the clerk scoops up the case and runs through the huge piles of sand.}
