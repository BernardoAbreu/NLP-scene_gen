<A>__{anne and the senator are still greeting new arrivals. anne's manner is somewhat preoccupied. she glances around as she speaks, as though looking for someone.}

<D>__{thank you so much, mr. lindsay. we'll look forward to it.}
<A>__{panning shot from anne's viewpoint the camera passes various groups of guests in conversation including guy and barbara who are together. from this distance we cannot hear what they are saying. camera continues to the front door. it opens to admit a new arrival. it is bruno. he wears white tie and tails, looking very elegant. we see guy excuse himself from barbara, cross to bruno and speak to him angrily, obviously asking, "what are you doing here?" bruno, however, greets guy with a smile then turns from him, unperturbed and bland. he sees anne and moves toward her, smiling.}

<C>__{senator}
<D>__{how do you do, sir.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i'd like to talk to you sometime, senator, about my idea of harnessing the life force. it will make atomic power look like the horse and buggy.}
<P>__{(the senator and anne}
<D>__{are beginning to look at him in}
<P>__{amazement)}
<D>__{i'm already developing my faculty for seeing millions of miles. and, senator, can you imagine being able to smell a flower on the planet of mars? i'd like to lunch with you some day soon and tell you more about it.}
<A>__{interrupted by new arrivals, bruno moves away out of the picture, with a charming smile to anne. the senator greets the new guests with open mouth and simply shakes their hands while glancing off in direction of the departing bruno.}

<P>__{(to senator)}
<D>__{so nice to see you, my dear senator.}
<C>__{senator}
<D>__{ah yes, indeed i beg your pardon?}
<A>__{she realizes he hasn't heard a word she's said and haughtily moves on. the senator turns to anne.}

<A>__{bruno talking to an elderly, dignified gentlemen.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{but tell me, judge, after you've sentenced a man to the chair, isn't it difficult to go and eat your dinner after that?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{young man, when a murderer is caught, he must be tried. when he is convicted, he must be sentenced. when he is sentenced to death, he must be executed.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{quite impersonal, isn't it, sir?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{so it is. besides, it doesn't happen every day.}
<A>__{at this moment, anne comes into the scene. she hesitates as she hears bruno's answer.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{so few murderers are caught.}
<A>__{the judge moves out of the way. bruno smiles blandly at the ladies. one of them speaks to him.}
<C>__{mrs. cunningham}
<D>__{well, mr. antony, you seem very interested in the subject of murder.}
<A>__{anne looks more troubled, then moves on out of the scene.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{no more than anyone else. no more than you, for instance.}
<C>__{mrs. cunningham}
<D>__{me? i'm not interested in murder.}
<A>__{bruno pulls up a chair to face the two woman on the settee, sits down, straddling the seat, to look at them over the back of the chair and settle down for a nice conversation.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(his tone is teasing)}
<D>__{oh, come now, everyone's interested in that. everyone would like to put someone out of the way. now surely, madame, you're not going to tell me that there hasn't been a time when you wanted to dispose of someone. your husband, for instance.}
<C>__{mrs. cunningham}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{good heavens, no!}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(playfully)}
<D>__{ah ah!}
<P>__{(shaking a finger at her)}
<D>__{are you sure? do you mean to tell me there wasn't a tiny moment when you'd been made really angry? and what did you say?}
<C>__{mrs. cunningham}
<P>__{(squirms, giggling)}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{there you are, you see! there you are! all right, now you're going to do a murder. how are you going to do it? this is the fascinating part how are you going to do it...i didn't get your name?}
<C>__{mrs. cunningham}
<D>__{mrs. cunningham.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{mrs. cunningham, how are you going to do it?}

<C>__{mrs. anderson}
<D>__{anderson.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(he is thoroughly enjoying himself)}
<D>__{that's better, mrs. anderson. but mrs. cunningham is in a dreadful hurry. poison could take...let's see...ten to twelve weeks, if poor mr. cunningham is to die from natural causes.}
<C>__{mrs. cunningham}
<D>__{i have a wonderful idea! i can take him out in the car and when i get to a lonely spot, knock him on the head with a hammer, pour gasoline over him and over the car and start the whole thing ablaze.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(looks at her deprecatingly)}
<D>__{and then have to walk all that way home?}
<A>__{mrs. anderson laughs.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{no, i have the best way, and the best tools.}
<P>__{(he holds out his hands and shows them)}
<D>__{simple, silent, and quick. the silent part being the most important. let me show you what i mean.}
<C>__{bruno }
<P>__{(he raises his hands}
<D>__{toward mrs. cunningham's throat, then stops a moment}
<P>__{to ask)}
<D>__{you don't mind if i borrow your neck for a moment do you?}
<C>__{mrs. cunningham}
<P>__{(giggles)}
<D>__{well, it's not for long.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{oh! no.}
<P>__{(he takes a drink and puts his glass down)}
<D>__{now, when i nod my head, just see if you can cry out, and i bet you can't.}
<P>__{(he places his hands}
<D>__{around mrs.}
<P>__{cunningham's neck)}
<D>__{now with my two thumbs...you see that's where i will be able to prevent any sound coming from you. now, just wait for the nod of my head.}

<B>__{closeup bruno}

<P>__{(thru the babble)}
<D>__{bring her upstairs.}
<A>__{as the two groups pass off in different directions, the few people who ran into the scene late are asking the others what the disturbance is. "what's wrong?" "did she faint?" "i didn't see anything." "what happened to him?" "somebody hurt?" but one small figure stands in the clear. it is barbara, she is still transfixed by what she has seen. her hands are trembling. camera moves slowly in on her. we see that her lips are trembling, too, and in her eyes frightened tears are welling. her breath is heavy.}
