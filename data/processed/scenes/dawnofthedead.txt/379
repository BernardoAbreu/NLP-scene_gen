<A>__{now, the enormous barricade of food cartons is stacked against the door again. it is quiet except for the little noises of eating and occasional rustle of paper. we also head a faint electronic whistle, but we do not recognise it. as we see more of the room, we find our refugees sitting near the reconstructed pyramid on the floor. peter seems to be asleep up against the pyramid. roger is nibbling at delicacies from the department store's gourmet department. their "loot" is laid around them on the floor. roger, as he eats, is leafing through the maintenance manual. there is a stack of tools, some still in wrapping; electric razors, still boxed; some clothing articles; the radio, which also plays small cassettes. there are soaps, toiletries, pens, pencils, and notebooks, flashlights, cigarettes and several decks of cards with a canister of chips. the items are clearly not all functional. some are representative of the luxuries considered necessary by a consumer society. they are all bathed in the blue glow from the television which stephen tries to tune in. its power cable is spliced into the leads of a bare light fixture overhead. fran cannot be seen at first.}

<D>__{as long as we're getting the pattern, that means they're sending.}
<A>__{roger snaps on the large, battery powered radio. he rolls the dial getting nothing but static. finally, he hears a signal and tunes it in. a badly modulated voice is droning through the interference. it sounds like a war correspondent sending a signal from very far away.}

<D>__{i know j.a.s is out by now... it was a madhouse back there... people are crazy... if they'd just organise... it's total confusion... i don't believe it's gotten this bad. i don't believe they can't handle it. look at us. loot at what we were able to do today.}
