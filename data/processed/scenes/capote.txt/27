<L>__{interior spare courtroom day}
<A>__{packed with press from all over the midwest, as well as local finney county citizens. dewey's leading the press conference from a folding table set up in front of the judge's bench, flanked by the two other kbi agents. he's got a cigarette burning in an ashtray. truman and nelle stand in the back.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i will talk facts but i won't speculate. the main fact here we need to be clear on is not one, but four people were killed. a lot of folks say herb clutter had to be the main target because he was dealt with the most brutally journalist #1 had his throat cut.}
<C>__{dewey}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{yes. we'd all like to know why. but it could've been any one of the family they were after. we just don't know journalist #2 you've identified the murder weapon?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{wounds indicate a shotgun, close range, but no casings were found. journalist #1 twelve gauge, hunting }
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{right. journalist #1 they were all shot in the face?}
<A>__{dewey looks at the journalist. then, evenly:}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{no. nancy in the back of the head. journalist #2 is there any evidence of, i'm sorry, sexual molestation of the women?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{no. journalist #2 anything else stolen?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{kenyon's radio seems to be the only... journalist #3 the boy was sixteen?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{fifteen. nancy was sixteen. journalist #2 it's her friend that found them?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{laura kinney. journalist #2 spell that?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i assume you're okay with the laura part. k i n n e y. but, please, leave her be.}
<A>__{lots of folks try to talk at once, one old man makes himself heard above the rest:}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{there's talk of a bunch of mexicans, a whole bunch of mexicans...}
<C>__{dewey}
<P>__{(standing, stubs out cigarette)}
<D>__{george, it's good to see you again. i do have an opinion whether this was the work of one man or a whole bunch, as you said, but it doesn't matter a whole lot whether it was mexicans or methodists or eskimos. we're going to find whoever did this. four good people from our community are dead. let's remember that. okay with you?}
<P>__{(holds up a notice)}
<D>__{the west kansas farm committee's offering a thousand dollar reward for information leading to an arrest. please print that.}
<P>__{(moving to the exit)}
<D>__{thank you all for coming.}
<A>__{the room is immediately noisy as dewey makes his way to the door, pulling a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, followed by church and nye. he's about to step out when truman catches his eye. dewey exits.}
