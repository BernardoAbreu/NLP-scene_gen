<L>__{interior kip's guest house later night}
<A>__{small, cluttered... posters of kurt cobain, a skying kobe bryant, pamela anderson, two nude girls draped over a glittering lamborghini espada, etc. there's a fish tank... and a big screen tv, on which the lakers are currently defending a high speed boston celtic fast break... memphis sits on a ratty couch before the tv... kip comes out of the bedroom... he's changed clothes ... he wears clunky fur lined moon boots, leopard skin speedos and a tshirt ... he looks slightly ridiculous... throughout the scene, memphis should be studying kip, as if he's seeing him for the very first time ... and waiting for the inevitable crack...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you okay ?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{totally. i'm fine. you want a beer, man ?}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{sure }
<A>__{and kip limps toward the refrigerator ... he comes back with two beers ... hands one to memphis ... glances at the tv }
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{you like kobe's game? i do. you think he's heir apparent to mj? i do. he speaks fluent italian, you know? so he's got that going for him }
<A>__{and a cut on kip's forehead starts to bleed ... kip grabs a towel ... presses it to his head }
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you sure you're okay ?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{yeah, man. where is your beer?}
<A>__{memphis holds it up ... kip nods ... there are a pile of ignitions on the table ... kip picks one up, absently begins trying to strip it...}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{cool. so you're living up north?}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{yeah }
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{i heard you were pumping gas }
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{something like that }
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{you're kind of cultivating a new look.}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{yeah }
<A>__{beat ... they watch the game ... kip replaces the soaked towel with another ...}
<C>__{memphis }
<D>__{maybe you need a stitch }
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{nah. it's a scratch.}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{okay }
<A>__{beat ...}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{hey, you want something to eat ?}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{what do you got ... ?}
<A>__{and kip hoists himself painfully to his feet ... limps over to the 'fridge ... memphis watches him, a slight grin at kip's attempt at cool ... kip peers into the 'fridge ...}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{not much. i got olives. you like olives? kalamata olives rule, i think. ma likes the calabrese. it's more mellow}
<A>__{and he brings over a bowl of olives.}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{there's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive }
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{yeah, yeah. that's what i'm thinking }
<A>__{and they nibble on them. kip bites into one ... and the juice stings his cracked lip ... but he disguises his grimace as an appreciative nod... and for a moment, they nibble olives and drop pits into an ashtray... then:}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{so what are you gonna do?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{"about what?"}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{about calitri? no worries, man. i will call him. he's a reasonable dude ...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{i can see that }
<A>__{and memphis glances out the window. to the crushed car. kip catches the glance, glances himself, chooses to ignore it.}
<C>__{memphis }
<D>__{you have everything ... under control?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{yeah. he just wants to know i'm still on it. he needs reassurance. all these big swinging dicks do. no worries. i won't let him get into our kool aid...}
<A>__{kip shrugs ... picks up another olive... remembers the pain' of the last one... drops it back in the bowl ... memphis is staring at him, disgusted... kip feels it ...}
<C>__{kip }
<D>__{what ?}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{and now memphis gets to his feet ... paces the place...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you just got crushed in a car. you're bleeding all over your self. and you sit there eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{c'mon, man... my "demise..."}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{overreaction}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{"over " you know i can maybe understand, since i been gone, you taking up this dumb ass life of crime, and for that i can partly blame myself. but what is baffling to me, is how, since i been gone, you've become a complete and total moron }
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{hey, now }
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{he's gonna kill you !}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{i can handle it }
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you can handle it?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{i can handle it }
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you can handle it?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{i can handle it }
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{me.}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{me...}
<A>__{beat ... hold the look ... kip shifts in his chair ... even this hurts... he tries to hide the wince ... memphis goes to the window, looks out at the harbor below... beat ... then:}
<C>__{kip }
<D>__{why? you think you can help me?}
<A>__{and he turns back to kip ...}
<C>__{kip }
<D>__{what can you do? you haven't done anything in six years but pump gas and go overall shopping. and the cars, they've changed ... there's new shit. computer chip keys and sophisticated alarms and i don't think, an old guy, could much bypass 'em...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you don't think so, huh?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{not really ... but you know... maybe i'm wrong ...}
<A>__{and the brothers look at each other ... in the pale glow of the tv... for a long beat ... and then we'll cut to:}
