<B>__{title sequence.}
<L>__{exterior bihar day (dawn, summer, mid 1980)}
<A>__{heat that has mass. that rises off the parched earth in shimmering waves. after a moment, we see what appear to be figures coming out of the haze, one by one. a family with their few belongings: hasari pal, 33, his wife, aloka, 28, and their children, daughter, amrita, 13, sons manooj and shambu, 11 and 9; hasari's mother and father. they embark toward the night, the rising sun behind them.}
<L>__{exterior roadside bus stop day (dawn)}
<A>__{hasari's father passes a gourd of precious water. hasari serves the children first. shambu gulps entirely too much, the others forcing him to stop by a unified force of will. embarrassed, he passes the cup to his brother, who sips, as does his sister. aloka barely wets her lips, insisting on leaving the last drops for hasari. and now, a rooster tail of dust rises up behind the approaching bus and the old parents bid farewell to their son's family. there is an intense sadness at leaving the land and hasari's mother clings to him...}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i will send money soon.}
<A>__{his mother nods, as hasari erupts in a small cough which, by habit, he suppresses. his mother crushes aloka to her.}
<C>__{hasari's mother}
<D>__{don't let the children out of your sight. not for a moment.}
<A>__{now the children. she wants to keep them here even as the old man touches her, reminding her she must let them go.}
<C>__{hasari's mother}
<D>__{help your parents. don't fight with each other. and, manooj, stay away from the cinema, do you hear?}
<A>__{shambu, his eyes big as saucers, whispers to his grandma...}
<C>__{shambu}
<D>__{i don't want to go. there are bad men with long knives who steal children.}
<A>__{that does it: hasari's mother dissolves in tears, but the old man nevertheless unlooses her insistently from the children. aloka and the children get on the bus as the old man embraces his son.}
<C>__{hasari's father}
<D>__{a man's journey to the end of his obligations is a very long road. yours begins here.}
<L>__{exterior roadside interior bus day}
<A>__{there's not an empty inch inside the little vehicle or on top. the passengers are silent. a woman breast feeds a baby. several passengers fan themselves. many sleep. the pals squeeze wearily into the rear seat.}
<C>__{manooj}
<P>__{(to his neighbor)}
<D>__{our farm has died, so we are moving to calcutta to become rich!}
<A>__{hasari and aloka look at each other: if only it were the pursuit of wealth and not survival. the woman under stands. and now the bus grinds forward and the pals look back. hasari coughs, suppresses it... as silence falls. the elder pals stand huddled together in the dust and we see, nestled behind a boulder at the roadside, a tiny, blue flower beautiful and fragile, but like all things alive, determined to live... and we hear the sound of a dozen voices chanting a quiet mantra in unison as we }
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior ashram another flower day}
<A>__{this flower floats gently in a bowl of water. the titles end as we pull back slowly to reveal a dozen anglos, several indians, and one kenyan seated cross legged before an aging yogi, who's quietly urging the suppli cants to find "their light, allow your white light to fill your spirit's eye." above, ceiling fans move the air. as we pan the group, we see that everyone has his her eyes closed in earnest meditation... until we come to an american, max loeb, 29, who pops open first his right eye looks to his right and left closes his right eye and opens his left eye looks left and right... and then, instead of continuing the mantra and the search for his white light, expels a stream of air through his pursed lips, making a vibrating, flatulent sound, one indicative of sizeable frustration and dismissal.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{get serious.}
<A>__{around him, other single eyes pop open, searching for the source of this unmeditative sound. max nods and smiles a wry smile as if to say: this just ain't doin' it for me, folks.}
<L>__{interior spartan room trumpet day}
<A>__{max closes the trumpet case and starts chucking his clothes and books in a knapsack and a small valise. we notice the hebrew letter chai on a gold chain around his neck. his girl friend, betsy kahn, overdressed somewhat in an indian style, endeavors to exercise the inner peace she's been pursuing...}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i swear to god, you never give anything enough time! what did you expect in five days, max?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{only what they promise in the brochure: inner peace, serenity, and a nice chant that gets rid of this rock in my gut. e.s.t., they do you in a weekend.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i would really appreciate it if you wouldn't be terribly glib just now, max.}
<A>__{that's okay with max, who's willing to eschew communica tion of all kinds and just finish heaving his stuff in the valise.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{am i to assume you'll be at the airport in calcutta a week from tomorrow?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{impossible to predict, betsy ilene kahn. maybe you better give me my ticket.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{screw you, max i paid for it! how many times am i going to let you walk out on me and come back?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i think only you can answer that, betsy ilene kahn.}
<A>__{she slaps him.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{do you really think that's an appropriate way to get rid of your western rage, bets?}
<A>__{she swings at him again. he catches her hand hard in his fist.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{one slap is romantic. two would call for retaliation... lend me a hundred dollars.}
<A>__{she yanks free, begins to chant her mantra as he grabs his knapsack and valise and goes out the door. now, she's silent and, in the simplest sense, deeply hurt. she can't help herself; she cares. we stay with her a moment as we }
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior country airport (assam) winding road day}
<A>__{cool, lush hills. a little pack of single engine two and four seaters. max, in shorts and university of miami t shirt, hot, sweaty, appears around a bend in the approach road.}
<L>__{interior airport waiting room}
<A>__{a small service desk. a clerk, who doubles as ground control on the microphone, passing on the prevailing wind and the active runway. we hear the static backed voice of a pilot, giving his call numbers, then announcing he's clear for immediate takeoff on the active runway. the clerk clicks off and finds max.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{how you doin'?}
<A>__{the clerk gives max a warm smile.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i've always wanted to walk into a little airport just about like this one and ask the guy at the counter the following question. ready?}
<A>__{the clerk nods; he's at max's ervice.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{when's the next flight to anywhere?}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{to bombay. tomorrow, at one o'clock in the afternoon.}
<A>__{a beat the clerk with his smile, max with his, one simply warm, the other giving off simmering heat.}
<L>__{exterior airport low angle day}
<A>__{max sits on the ground, up against the building, playing a jazz line quietly and rather well on his trumpet. a pair of well shod feet enter the frame. max looks up.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the rubicund face of veejay chattergee, 50, and more british than churchill. behind him, his cherubic wife, ravi... and making her way toward the enclave of small planes, their daughter, manubai, 26.}
<C>__{veejay}
<D>__{i say, are you looking for a way out of here? we have an extra seat. where are you wanting to go?}
<A>__{max's eyes flick from veejay to the back view of manubai as she continues on and back to veejay.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm wanting to go wherever you're wanting to take me.}
<L>__{interior 180 four seater day}
<A>__{max is crammed into the back seat with the plump ravi.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{we see now that, contrary to our assumption that veejay would be in the left seat, it's manubai who's flying the plane. the noise of the engine forces them to speak somewhat loudly.}
<C>__{veejay}
<D>__{we were among the fortunate back in '48. we got out of east bengal before partition destroyed so many. we make mattresses. the rajah double spring.}
<A>__{veejay has an old flask out.}
<C>__{veejay}
<D>__{we don't have a flight attendant on this flight...}
<P>__{(passing the flask)}
<D>__{are you a musician, mr. loeb?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{unattached trumpet player and recently certified associate guru.}
<A>__{as he takes a hit on the flask, max's eye focuses on the little mirror on the dash. in it he can see manubai's eyes. if we were to judge by what he sees in them, she doesn't find him the least bit amusing. he smiles his smile at her.}
<L>__{exterior howrah station (calcutta) day (early morning)}
<A>__{a huge bridge dominates the skyline. the train trundles to a stop, its whistle clearing the way. people hang on its sides, sit on the roof... and now flood the platform, flowing into the station, clearing a view for us of the pals, clinging to their baggage in the middle of this human anthill. close on them (moving) hands reach out with sweets to sell, with tea, asking for money.}
<C>__{manooj}
<D>__{daddy, i'm scared.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{scared? no why? this is very exciting. as soon as we get to our friend's house, everything will be fine.}
<A>__{but, despite hasari's charade of confidence, they (and we) are overwhelmed by the size of the station and the desperate energy of the humanity around them. as they press on, a small beggar woman huddled on the platform turns her eyes eerily on manooj... as a deformed hand stretches into the frame. aloka senses someone: a beggar, face half hidden and eaten away by leprosy. this terrifying image presses the boys tightly to their mother and moves hasari to encircle armita with one hand and attempt to wrap the other three inside the embrace of his other hand. it does not seem possible that he can protect all of them against the predatory eyes watching them. he moves them quickly to a wall...}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{wait right here. don't move.}
<B>__{with hasari}
<A>__{he moves to a line of vendors, shows a piece of paper to one, as he digs out his precious screw of money to make a purchase of sweets from the vendor.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{please, can you direct me to my friend at this address? we are to stay with him.}
<A>__{the vendor gives the address a look, shows it to the vendor next to him. both look at hasari.}
<D>__{vendor #1 there's no such address as this in calcutta.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{but that's not possible. vendor #1 of course it is possible! i have lived here all my life. you are new. who would know if a place exists or does not? vendor #2 bombay, perhaps. delhi. look there.}
<A>__{dear god, what now? stunned, hasari hands vendor #1 a rupee and, with the sweets, turns back to his family, his face going through a magical transformation as he prepares to suggest to the family that all is well.}
<L>__{exterior chowringhee lane day (midday sun)}
<A>__{a few clean and cared for ambassador cars sweep into the gateway of the grand hotel, past a gateman.}
<T>__{rack focus to:}
<A>__{feet maidan feet tramping the pulsating tarmac, sending up dust.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the pals, scared, dispirited, weary, consumed by the crowd. they've been walking a long time. shambu cries; aloka tries to ease his fear. they stop numbly at the edge of the park, put their bundles down against a long wall. across the way, a thin policeman shares a cigarette with a group of traders. there is a deeply fearful look in hasari's eyes, a look he is having difficulty controlling now. he needs to revive the family's confidence. he takes out his precious bundle of rupees and gives one to manooj. manooj, though, is fixed on the cinema across the street. hasari indicates a stall just across the main road.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{manooj, go and get some fruit. come straight back.}
<A>__{delighted with his task, manooj sets off, his eyes on the marquee of the theater with its huge cardboard cutout of kumar kapur, starring in hot gun. hasari calls out to him to watch where he's going; the mere crossing of the street is a potential parental nightmare. a hand ruffles manooj's head and a tall man with dark eyes and a sweet smile comes at the boy's anxious parents.}
<C>__{gangooly }
<D>__{yes, hello, brother. bihar, am i correct?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{yes, how did you know?}
<A>__{hasari is torn between speaking to the man and watching his son's incredible journey across the street.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{let me say only that the terrible malevolence that has visited your part of the country affects us all.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{three years without rain. nothing came out of the earth but debts.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{terrible. and now, the family on the street. it is not acceptable.}
<P>__{(smile widens)}
<D>__{and if i can't help, my name is not mr. gangooly... which, blessedly, it is.}
<A>__{and now a smile as full as the sky above.}
<L>__{exterior small building in back street day}
<A>__{a brick slides out of the wall. we're behind the brick and see gangooly's soft face as he reaches in and pulls out a key. the street is small and empty. though the houses are nothing much, to the pals, they look like palaces. manooj and shambu run about in delight. gangooly motions for quiet. with a flourish, he opens the door.}
<L>__{interior small room day}
<A>__{gangooly enters, glances around, waves the pals in. they're amazed. there's a cage occupied by two parrots. in one corner, a small altar dedicated to the goddess lakshmi is decorated with some flowers and, behind a torn, plastic curtain in a corner, part kitchen, part wash place, containing a tap with running water.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{be free look around.}
<A>__{on the faces of the family is one thought: is it possible? amrita goes right to the parrots.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{they'll need feeding. give them seed. but don't spoil them.}
<A>__{he bows briefly before the altar as he moves to the washing area.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{and now, one of the miracles of life in the city. one and two...}
<A>__{he turns on the tap and a stream of brown water gurgles out. the pals are hypnotized, the fists around their hearts begin to ease.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{holy water from the ganges! flows out forever. come touch it.}
<A>__{manooj and shambu put their hands under the tap.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{drink! it's as pure as the dew on shiva's lips.}
<A>__{they drink. gangooly claps in delight... and beckons hasari aside.}
<B>__{favoring gangooly and hasari}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{now, this place is yours for two weeks. my cousin, moti, is away, traveling. normally, the rent takes fifty rupees for a week, but for a brother, forty. no, don't thank me.}
<A>__{hasari pulls out his little screw of money.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i have only seventy five, but as soon as i have work...}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{give me the fifty, pay the rest next week. you'll find work, i trust you. aren't i from bihar, too? yes.}
<A>__{and the money is in his hand. he joins his hands together.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{you are pleased? then mr. gangooly is pleased. it's how i am.}
<A>__{he turns on his heel and he's gone. for a moment, the pals are still, swept from the brink of catastrophe to salvation... and now, as one, they release their sheer and utter joy.}
<L>__{interior chattergee staircase day}
<A>__{ravi and veejay leading max up the grand staircase, manubai in the foyer, looking after them.}
<L>__{interior guest room day}
<A>__{ravi leads the way into a lovely guest bedroom.}
<C>__{ravi}
<D>__{i hope this is all right. the room hasn't been aired or the bed turned, but }
<C>__{veejay}
<D>__{oh, he doesn't care about that, do you, max? here, look here.}
<A>__{veejay opens a little cupboard, stocked with liquor.}
<C>__{veejay}
<D>__{help yourself. be comfortable. ravi, come on, go, go, let's leave the young man to himself.}
<A>__{obediently, ravi goes. veejay follows. max goes to the window.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the beautiful manubai in the garden.}
<B>__{max}
<A>__{he lies down on the bed. he's found nirvana.}
<L>__{interior main room day}
<A>__{it's hasari who watches now. there's laughter from aloka and amrita. joyful shouts from the boys. hasari is alone in the main room, on his knees, in front of the pile of their baggage and bundles. he turns his atten tion from the laughter to a just opened, old suitcase. he takes out a small tea box. opens it delicately. it's full of something brown. he pushes his fingers in and feels this bit of earth with a tenderness that's almost religious, puts a pinch to his nose and breathes it in. the laughter and shouting from the bathing area is growing.}
<L>__{interior bathing area}
<A>__{shambu is paddling near the tap. aloka is bending over the drain and amrita is rinsing her heavy, dark hair with a pot. manooj is nearby, rubbing himself with an old towel. hasari enters unnoticed and looks at the group with tenderness... and with gratitude for their good fortune. a man, red with anger, yanks the curtain aside, stares. the family freezes. aloka's hair drips unnoticed on her sari.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{what are you doing here? who are you?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{my name is pal, hasari. mr. gangooly rented this space to }

<D>__{mr. who?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{gangooly. you must be his cousin, mr. moti.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i don't know any gangooly and my name is binal and this is my home get out!}
<A>__{the furious binal, followed by the pals, goes into the main part of the room. a small crowd has been attracted by the noise.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{but this is true. we paid him a deposit of fifty }
<C>__{binal}
<D>__{a man goes out because he has to work, and some beggar tries to move in while his back is turned.}
<A>__{this while binal has begun to throw things out onto the street, though this cleansing of his home doesn't stop him from picking up a stick. the odd sympathizer meets with...}
<C>__{binal}
<D>__{so, should i suffer if they are so stupid to jump into the first mouth that wants to eat them?}
<A>__{he turns with the stick on hasari.}
<C>__{binal}
<D>__{you're lucky i don't kill you!}
<A>__{hasari looks at manooj, who drops his eyes. they collect the remainder of their possessions and hurry out the door.}
<L>__{exterior small street day}
<A>__{full of neighbors. there's a suppressed violence in the air. a man pushes aloka. sweat streaming down his face, hasari confronts the man. a woman pushes the men apart.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{go to the river. try to squeeze in there.}
<L>__{exterior victoria monument street night (dusk)}
<A>__{calcutta broiling: buses, vendors, carts, rickshaws, children beg at car windows. the pals stand, uncertain, and for the first time a rickshaw fills hasari's eye, carrying two passengers. but now he shoulders his burden and leads the family toward the river. we hold until they grow small against the setting sun, gleaming red against the white domes of the victoria monument.}
<L>__{interior chattergee's library torso night}
<A>__{moving through the dark, a figure, touching things, looking at photographs of the chattergees. we hear a muffled dialogue mixed with the singing a la dean martin of "everybody loves somebody sometime": "goddamn it, boy, what's the matter with you? "everybody loves somebody sometime" "go for it, son!" "sure, dad, whatever you say, dad." "everybody falls in love somehow" "you're the dad, dad." now, a humidor. max opens it, takes out a cigar, takes two. takes five. senses someone. turns.}

<B>__{family}
<A>__{after their humiliating flight, they found refuge here. tiny figures huddled together with their baggage and bundles, near a tree, not far from the steps that dip down to the smooth water. hasari's eyes, too, are on the dead man, that warning. he kneels beside manooj, strokes him. the boy's eyes turns to the man's, wondering if the man can provide for them.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{don't let it frighten you. you have to be brave. i know we'll find work today.}
<A>__{fear and doubt fill manooj's eyes. he nods.}

<A>__{hasari at the gates, the family huddled together in the b.g. the man behind the gate shakes his head, points.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{a line of a hundred men stretches from a door. hasari is on the edge of panic, but when he turns to the family, he's wearing his confident smile. as before, he gathers the family into the protectorate of his arms and guides them onward. as he pushes off into the sea of humanity, we pull back and up, filling the frame with street upon street, disappearing hasari. from street into workshop hasari and owner two plump men in shirt sleeves look coolly at hasari. the elder shakes his head. the younger shows hasari the door. outside, an increasingly desperate hasari finds aloka before a small shrine, saying a prayer.}

<A>__{shambu looks, but the car's gone.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{don't do that. we're not beggars.}
<A>__{shambu is devastated. out of his own desperation, hasari feels he's been a little rough on the boy. he holds him close.}

<D>__{do you have family?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{yes, yes of course. but i'm three days without work. i will take anything.}

<C>__{max}
<D>__{well, gee, i don't know. maybe i could say something so amusing that you'd laugh so hard it would break that hot poker you have up your ass.}
<A>__{she stares at him. he bends to kiss her. she doesn't pull away... but after a moment he realizes she isn't responding. he continues the kiss, but he opens his eyes... to find her staring at him. he pulls back. they stare at each other another moment, then max senses someone in the doorway.}
