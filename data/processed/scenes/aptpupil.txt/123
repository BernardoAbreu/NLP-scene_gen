<A>__{the faucet runs at full blast to hide the noise as todd digs through the medicine cabinet and takes out a bottle of pepto bismol. he takes off the cap and gulps down what is left in the bottle. he finishes and takes a few deep breaths. as he turns around he catches his reflection in the mirror. an empty bottle in his hand, a bright pink ring around his lips, a few pink splotches down his shirt he looks totally ridiculous. todd can't help but laugh.}
