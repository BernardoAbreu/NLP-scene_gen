<A>__{the men rush in. fuchs and copper stand by the open plasma storage refrigerator. the inside is a mess of dried blood. the bladders have been ripped open. copper is ghastly pale.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{somebody got to the blood... sabotaged it.}
<C>__{nauls}
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<A>__{a horrified silence.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{was it broken into?}
<C>__{fuchs}
<D>__{no. somebody opened it. closed it. and then locked it.}
<A>__{sanchez twitches, terrified.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{well, who's got access to it?}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{i guess i'm the only one.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{and i've got the only key.}
<A>__{several pairs of eyes turn to garry.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{would that test have worked?}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{norris}
<D>__{somebody else sure as hell thought so.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{who else could have used that key?}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{ah... no one... i give it to copper when he needs it...}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{could anyone have gotten it from you?}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{i don't see how... when i'm finished i return it right away.}
<C>__{norris}
<D>__{when was the last time you used it?}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<P>__{(uneasy)}
<D>__{a day or so ago... i guess.}
<A>__{garry senses the nervous and inquiring eyes on him.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{i suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me. but...}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{that key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt. now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?}
<C>__{garry}
<P>__{(upset, flustered)}
<D>__{look, i haven't been near that... that refrigerator.}
<A>__{silence as the men continue to stare. sanchez is perspiring.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{copper's the only one who has any business with it.}
<A>__{the eyes shift from garry to copper.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{now... wait a second, garry, you've been in here on several occasions...}
<C>__{fuchs}
<D>__{and the doc thought of the test.}
<C>__{childs}
<P>__{(anger)}
<D>__{so what?! is that supposed to leave him in the clear?! bullshit!}
<A>__{sanchez bolts out the door. stunned for a beat, the others chase after him.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{hey, sanchez!}
<B>__{sanchez}
<A>__{in terror, runs at top speed through the narrow corridors. opening and shutting doors. the others are in pursuit. they shout for him to stop.}
