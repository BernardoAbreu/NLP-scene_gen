<L>__{interior grand ballroom later}
<A>__{wills and charlotte slow dance to a romantic ballad. wills seems entranced by her easy manner of expression }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i met ella in the fourth grade. she was my teacher at the little red school house. we stayed friends after she retired. she taught me how to cook and sew... speak italian... basically enjoy life, have fun that's what she was best at... even when she knew she was dying.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{the most important thing she did was introduce me to poetry. she believed it was the highest form of art and that everything we say and do should aspire to it.}
<A>__{wills is uncomfortable for a moment, then ventures quietly }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{it sounds as though, in a way, she took your mom's place...}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{my mom and my dad's. after they died, dolly was so devastated she pretty much gave up on everything. it was like if something that tragic could happen, there was no way she was ever gonna care about anyone else ever again. including herself. she wasn't a horrible parent... she didn't abuse me or anything... she just ignored me. she was more like a weird landlady than a grandmother.}
<A>__{charlotte smiles sadly. her eyes glisten in the light.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i'm sure she did the best she could.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{for a long time i kinda thought that, too, and i made excuses for her, but now i don't. i was seven years old and i needed her and she wasn't there.}
<A>__{silence as wills somberly reflects. finally, he speaks }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i remember when i heard the news about your parents. you know how after a crash they print a long list of names in the newspaper? well, i grew up outside boston, so i naturally started to scan the list. but casually, not expecting to }
<A>__{suddenly, a swing song starts. wills smiles at the ironic change of mood, then turns to escort charlotte away }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{oh, no, come on! i love this stuff! don't you? didn't you grow up on it?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{how old do you think i am?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{ancient!}
<A>__{holding his hand, she starts moving to the music. wills laughs }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i have no idea what to do!}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{have fun!}
<A>__{she flings her wrap onto a chair and keeps dancing. wills, charmed senseless, finally surrenders. a sequence begins during which we see wills and charlotte having an inordinately good time. wills maintains a modicum of reserve; charlotte is joyful and entirely unembarrassed. certain guests notice them. the reactions to their pairing runs from confusion to disgust to amusement. but no one watches them more carefully than lisa. finally, in the middle of a song, wills and charlotte make their way off the floor, winded and laughing. wills heads off to the bar. charlotte turns around and watches the other dancers. then we notice lisa standing next to her. they smile at each other. lisa offers her a cocktail napkin. charlotte takes it and wipes off her brow. they speak above the music }
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i had to come. i work at the met. what's your excuse?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{sort of a date.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{with wills keane, right?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you know him?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{just by reputation.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{a major womanizer, right?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{that's what they say.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm lisa.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{charlotte fielding.}
<A>__{they shake hands. lisa looks away and sees wills making his way toward them with two glasses of punch. coolly covering, lisa beats a hasty retreat }
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{anyway, i should keep mingling. but it was nice to meet you.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{same here.}
<A>__{lisa smiles politely and walks away. wills walks up, watching lisa melt into the crowd. his brow is furrowed. he's wondering if his eyes have deceived him. he hands charlotte a punch }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{who was that?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{lisa something.}
<A>__{the name hits home. wills is flustered, but then he covers as best he can and lifts his glass }
<C>__{wills}
<P>__{(lifting his glass)}
<D>__{here's to }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{us.}
<A>__{wills smiles slowly and they toast.}
