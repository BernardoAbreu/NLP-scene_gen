<A>__{a moment later, a second cris follows the first cris to the register, repeating his every movement.}
<C>__{cris }
<D>__{it's a joke, but it's true. the future changes every time you look at it. because you looked at it.}

<D>__{cause once you see it, you're different.}

<P>__{cris (v.o.)}
<D>__{that's why i stay away from roulette and craps. it only takes a millionth of an ounce to change a roll. just placing a different bet can throw things off.}

<D>__{do it, quick, before somebody else gets there.}
<A>__{while the gambler dawdles, a midwestern dowager plants herself at the mega slot and starts feeding it dollars. cris sighs and walks off. the gambler watches him go, then reacts to bells, flashing lights, and shrieks of celebration. the dowager has hit the mega jackpot. blackjack section cris takes a stool at a crowded table.}
<C>__{cris }
<D>__{mainly i stick to blackjack. boring but controllable.}
<A>__{cris antes up. cards are dealt. he's got a four showing. taking a hit, he goes bust with a jack. so in real time, he sticks.}

<A>__{the dealer turns over his cards. he's got a king and a deuce. so he has to draw. pulls the jack. busted. the dealer pays cris, then presses a button under the table.}
