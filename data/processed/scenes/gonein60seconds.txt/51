<L>__{exterior international towers high rise condos day}
<A>__{the garage door opens as a resident drives out ... and memphis and donny and kip and toby enter the garage ... they walk along the rows of parked cars ... searching ...}
<C>__{donny astricky}
<D>__{car jacking is the lazy man's boost. no skill. no finesse. can only take the car if the key is in it. that's not thieving. that's parking ... thugs ... with the decency of dirt ...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{they're just cars, man ...}
<A>__{to prevent donny from biting the kid's head off, memphis chimes in with:}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{this eleanor's been living at the international towers for 3 years now.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{who's "eleanor?"}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{the 167 mustang shelby mustang gt 500.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{why do you call it "eleanor?"}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{all the vehicles get code names. female names. you say "eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...}
<C>__{donny astricky}
<D>__{eleanor is memphis' "unicorn."}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{and there she is }
<A>__{indeed, slotted nearby is a '67 shelby mustang gt 500 silver with black top ...}
<C>__{memphis }
<D>__{hello, eleanor }
<A>__{and he looks at her. an old friend he hasn't seen in years.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it looks just like a regular mustang }
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{don't go there, toby }
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{she's not. carroll shelby tweaked the mustang's high performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... but its actual output is closer to 600 ...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{so she flies }
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{she soars }
<C>__{donny astricky}
<D>__{grade a unicorn ...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{what's a "unicorn?"}
<C>__{donny astricky}
<D>__{fabled creature. you know the horse with the horn? impossible to capture?}
<A>__{toby looks blank ...}
<C>__{donny astricky }
<D>__{we all got one. the single car that, no matter how many times you try to boost, something happens... cops show up, car doesn't start, owner comes back. it's voodoo...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you guys and the car thing, man }
<A>__{they head off ... memphis turns back to the shelby}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{see you in a few days, eleanor }
