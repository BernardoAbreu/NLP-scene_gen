<B>__{the silver zippo}
<A>__{rolls between dirty fingers.}
<L>__{interior paradise falls gas 'n' grub night}
<A>__{bob plays with his trusty zippo with one hand and grills up some steaks with the other. he pauses in his cooking every few moments to take a slug from a can of beer. can't get it down fast enough. sandra sits at the counter across from him, staring at a prescription bottle tipped in front of her, pills spread around. bob glances over, sees the devastation in her eyes. he pulls another can of beer from underneath the counter, pops it and places it in front of her.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{on the house.}
<A>__{she looks up at him. smiles weakly. takes a sip.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you hungry?}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{couldn't eat if my life depended on it.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{well i figure just cuz the world's coming to an end, it doesn't mean a man's gotta starve. all i can say is thank heavens they left the gas on.}
<A>__{sandra takes another sip of beer. considers it.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{never much cared for beer. howard's the beer drinker in the family.}
<A>__{the moment the words leave her mouth, the grief hits her again. she gathers up some pills from the counter, tosses them back and downs her beer like there's no tomorrow. this is a battle she's losing. meanwhile in a booth across the diner, audrey is fiddling with percy's old radio. back and forth on the dial. listening for anything. nothing but static. up at the front of the diner, jeep silently helps michael nail broken table planks across the shattered window. he eyes the strange tatoos running down michael's arms, the two jagged wounds visible above his shirt line.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{what did you do...you know, before you came here...?}
<A>__{michael considers the question a beat, then:}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i was a soldier, a general, in his army.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{well, what changed? what made you leave?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i was given an order i didn't believe in...}
<P>__{(off jeep's look:)}
<D>__{he lost faith. i hadn't.}
<A>__{michael drives the last nail into place, securing the window.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{so what happens to you...after this is over?}
<A>__{michael pauses a beat, as if unsure how much to say, then:}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{sometimes we have to face the thing we fear the most in order to be free of it.}
<A>__{michael picks up his gun.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it's almost time for the next shift.}
<A>__{michael heads for the roof, leaving jeep to stare after him, deep in thought.}
