<A>__{taft with gopher in his car.}
<C>__{taft}
<D>__{do they have money in there?}
<C>__{gopher}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{taft}
<D>__{they wouldn't meet here otherwise.}
<A>__{gopher shrugs; a decision: taft picks up his radio.}
<C>__{taft}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{okay, everybody, here's the play...}
<L>__{interior garage night}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{we're prepared to give you 80% of the money. the remainder you invest in our business with proceeds paid out according to the figures there.}
<A>__{he indicates the prospectus that guzman has been looking through.}
<C>__{guzman}
<D>__{this looks interesting. i'd have to confirm everything, of course. do you have a sample of the product?}
<A>__{elias produces one. guzman gestures to molto. molto samples it. molto's eyes widen.}
<C>__{molto}
<D>__{buy it!}
<C>__{guzman}
<D>__{where is our money?}
<A>__{elias hands him a key, points to a different winnebago. molto takes the key, unlocks the back: money. he signals okay to guzman. suddenly: sirens. police cars wail into the garage. the thwack thwack and sweeping light of a helicopter descend toward the roof (though we never see the copter).}
<C>__{guzman}
<P>__{(continuing; anger)}
<D>__{you set this up.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{they're after us, not you.}
<A>__{everybody scatters. the garage is a labyrinth of cement stairwells, ramps, hundreds of rvs to hide between, under and so forth... lots of noise, lights, but mostly we see hull and elias dodging here, avoiding the action.}
