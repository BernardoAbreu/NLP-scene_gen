<A>__{a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away... a vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. war drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity.}
<D>__{it is a period of civil war. rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil galactic empire. during the battle, rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the empire's ultimate weapon, the death star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. pursued by the empire's sinister agents, princess leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy...}
<A>__{the awesome yellow planet of tatooine emerges from a total eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. a tiny silver spacecraft, a rebel blockade runner firing lasers from the back of the ship, races through space. it is pursed by a giant imperial stardestroyer. hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the imperial stardestroyer, causing the main solar fin of the rebel craft to disintegrate.}
