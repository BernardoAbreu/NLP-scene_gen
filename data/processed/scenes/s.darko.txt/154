<D>__{it's gonna take a couple days.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{for a water pump?}
<A>__{sam and corey shrug.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{it's none of my business, but...}
<A>__{he's distracted when jeremy's bmw pulls up and parks. he hops out and hustles across the field toward the crash site...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{chris regains his train of thought:}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i was just gonna say, if you wanted, i could give you a ride back.}
<A>__{he looks right at sam when he says this. he then glances over at corey, as if just remembering that she were there.}
