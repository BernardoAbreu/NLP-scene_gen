<L>__{interior yussef and ahmed's house day}
<D>__{yussef and ahmed are jerking a couple of young goats with very sharp knives. they set the thin strips on newspaper. they look nervous. they talk in whispers.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{d'you think something happened?}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{people were screaming. they are silent for a long while.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{it was your fault. yussef stares at him in disbelief.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{it was both our faults. we both shot.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{swear to me you'll never say anything. ahmed won't answer. yussef looks around the room to make sure nobody is listening to them.}
<C>__{yussef }
<D>__{swear. nobody, never. ahmed remains pensive. he sighs and answers.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{i swear. nobody.}
