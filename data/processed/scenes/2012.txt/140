<A>__{as far as you can see is a series of identical little houses. the house in the foreground has a chicken coop in the garden. mrs. pang enters the coop. we last saw her when the village was being evacuated. she grabs one of the hens. she places its head on a woodblock and picks up a rusty hatchet. just about to strike, she hears a strange rattling noise. an old truck comes driving towards the house. behind the wheel sits her son neng. she puts down the hatchet, yelling.}
