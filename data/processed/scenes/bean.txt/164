<L>__{interior the learys' house. kevin's bedroom night}
<A>__{kevin is playing an adventure game: `goblins 2' [this game exists.] the goblins chuckle and make stupid noises that bean can imitate. a catchy piece of music accompanies the game. the computer monitor shows the inside of the wizard's house. kevin moves the goblins, and two little characters, fingus and winkle, around the room by clicking on areas in the room with his mouse. bean and kevin are both wearing pointed goblin hats made from newspaper.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{it's so embarrassing. all the guys i know are on goblins 3 and i'm still stuck with the lousy wizard in goblins 2.}
<A>__{bean is interested in the computer because he likes the cute little goblins. he gets his delighted face right up to the screen. he sings along with the catchy tune. kevin is getting frustrated.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{come on, winkle.}
<A>__{kevin clicks on a cuckoo clock in the wizard's room. the cuckoo pops out holding a key in its beak.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{it's gotta be here. something to get the key away from the stupid cuckoo.}
<A>__{bean scans the monitor screen: he spots a little frog at the bottom of the scene. his eyes light up. he takes the mouse and rapidly and repeatedly clicks on the frog.}
<C>__{bean}
<D>__{click, click, click, click, click ...}
<A>__{the frog croaks and jumps off a little round stone. kevin gets excited.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{how'd you do that!? that was so obvious!!!}
<A>__{bean grins and makes winkle pick up the stone. then he clicks through to inside the wizard's house. he makes winkle throw the stone at the cuckoo which instantly drops the key from its beak.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{beanie, you are waaaaay cool!}
<A>__{kevin slaps bean on the back. bean is delighted. close on monitor, showing the goblin game }
