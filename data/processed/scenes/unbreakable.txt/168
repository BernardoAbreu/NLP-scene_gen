<A>__{david's body is tangled in the pool cover. his legs and arms thrash against the constricting black tarp. he's drowning.}
<B>__{glimpses of light from the house pierce the darkness under water. the blurred image of a distant figure high above on a balcony flickers and disappears.}
<A>__{the last of the tarp slides out from under the sandbags that old it in place around the edge of the pool. the rain keeps falling. the tarp moves like it's alive underwater. it shifts and wraps david tighter with every movement.}
<B>__{glimpses of light again. two small figures now stand in a blurred silhouette near}
<A>__{the edge of the pool. flashes of something shiny they're holding... a rod or pole... it's shaky nebulous image waivers in the air above the surface. david's only free hand reaches for the light. it catches the silver pole. the tangled mass of david and the tarp are pulled slowly towards the edge of the pool. david's head and shoulders emerge from the darkness. he takes hold of the pool's edge. huge desperate breaths as he pulls his body out from the water and the grasp of the tarp. he hauls himself onto the ground. he sits hunched over in a dark mass, his head down under his hood. the rain poncho covering him like a blanket. beat. he rises to his feet. the water rushes off of him. his breathing is slowing, calming. he stands in a silhouette from the light of the house. he turns and looks to the two small figures standing near the edge of the pool. the children from the bathroom stand still in the rain. they're holding an aluminum pole with a brush head for cleaning the pool. they stare up at the hooded figure. no one says anything.}
