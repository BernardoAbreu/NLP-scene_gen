<L>__{exterior factory day}
<A>__{smoke pours with confused indecision from every window of a five story factory as the pumper and ladder company pull up.}
<C>__{grindle}
<P>__{(staring at confusing smoke)}
<D>__{i hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(to schmidt)}
<D>__{call in another alarm. we're gonna need some back up.}
<A>__{everyone begins strapping on air tanks and masks. adcox drags the rig's suction line to the hydrant. a beautiful illegally parked mercedes is blocking the way.}
<C>__{axe}
<P>__{(to stephen)}
<D>__{oh these moments do try me...}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(admiring car)}
<D>__{be gentle.}
<A>__{whistling to himself, adcox smashes the brass coupling through the passenger window, runs the line through and smashes it out the other window before connecting up to the hydrant. stephen and grindle pull hose off the bed and move out. brian's so jacked up he can't get his air tank on right. schmidt calmly helps him into his gear.}
<C>__{schmidt}
<D>__{it's only rock 'n roll, kid.}
<A>__{stephen, adcox and grindle are crouched at the door, ready to go. brian takes a hose roll and runs to catch up when he's cut off by dazed latin workers shouting incoherently at him in spanish.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{hey, probie! how 'bout it, huh?}
<A>__{brian pushes past the workers and takes his position on the hose line. stephen reaches over and re adjusts brian's air tank strap.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you're doing it wrong.}
<A>__{stephen eases the door open. thick smoke rolls sickly out over their heads.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(to brian)}
<D>__{stay beside me.}
<A>__{and in they go...}
