<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{a porsche knifes through darkened streets. the driver, 50, is dressed for success. pulling up to the brownstone we saw earlier, he gets out and rubs his eyes. another day in the salt mines. climbing the short stairs, he sticks his key into the lock and opens the door. it is the last thing he will ever do. a thundering explosion engulfs the stoop.}
<L>__{interior pub night}
<A>__{the place is packed now with girls flirting with the candidates, putting their helmets on, etc. the horseplay around the bar suddenly stops at the sweet sound of a siren.}
<L>__{exterior pub night}
<A>__{everyone steps outside, cocks an ear. and here it comes, the real thing, screeching past in a full tilt rush. shouts and raised toasts.}

<C>__{tim}
<D>__{don't want you overheating, brian!}
<A>__{brian ducks the stream and pulls a length of hose near his feet, flipping tim. brian jumps him, shuts off the hose and pins him to the pavement.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{okay okay! uncle!}
<A>__{brian walks back toward jennifer}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you've certainly matured.}
<A>__{she turns to leave.}
<C>__{brian}

<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i don't want to be your friend, brian.}
<A>__{another in a series of fire engines howl past. tim grabs brian by the shoulder.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{let's go, man!}
