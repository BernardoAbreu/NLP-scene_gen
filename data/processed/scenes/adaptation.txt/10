<L>__{interior office day}
<A>__{subtitle: hollywood, california, three weeks earlier the office is decorated with potted flowers, audobon posters, lots of books. kaufman, nervous and sweaty, watches margaret, a soulful development executive, unpack boxes.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{so anyway i just wanted to stop by to congratulate you on your promotion.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{well, thanks again. it's all so stupid.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i think it's great. your photo in the trades and everything. pretty cool.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{anyway. yeah. so what's up with you?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i'm considering jobs. mostly crap. there's one you might like, about flowers.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{flowers? really? what is it?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{they want me to do an adaptation of a book called the orchid thief.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{oh my god! you're kidding? i read that! i loved that book!}
<A>__{kaufman is thrilled; he's scored. margaret pulls a copy of the orchid thief from her bookshelf.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{see, see, see! i'm not lying to you!}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i loved the book.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{oh, charlie, orchids are the most amazing flowers. so complex.}
<A>__{margaret plops onto the couch next to kaufman.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i know. they're really great.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{you should take this job. doesn't it sound exciting, to immerse yourself in a real subject and learn everything about it? blake wrote about seeing heaven in a wild flower. and after you learn all this stuff, you can teach me!}
<C>__{kaufman}
<P>__{(thrilled but controlled)}
<D>__{that'd be fun.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{god, they're such beautiful flowers. and so sexy. y'know?}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{did you know that orchid means }
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{testicle. i just read that.}
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(shrieks with delight)}
<D>__{testicle! can you believe it!}
<A>__{margaret giggles happily. kaufman giggles weirdly.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{i swear, it'd be fucking great for someone to have the testicles to make that book into a movie, man. instead of this bullshit all the time. something not about sex and violence and car chases and love stories, people learning profound lessons. jesus, isn't nature enough?}
