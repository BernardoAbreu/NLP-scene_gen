<L>__{exterior jungle day}
<A>__{it is a memory: blurry and overexposed, the color washed out. we see a weathered wooden sign which reads "africa." the sound of running feet, huffing frantic breathing. we watch from up in a tree (elijah's pov) as two men in safari suits chase a couple of chimps across the jungle floor. the chimps are screaming as the safari men tackle them and tie them up. the safari men laugh.}
<C>__{safari man}
<D>__{well, there monkeys ain't going nowhere. let's get us a couple a brews 'fore the boss comes back...}
<A>__{the safari men leave the chimps on the ground. we descend from the trees to the ground next to the bound chimps. one of the chimps looks at the camera. he grunts and squeals.}
<C>__{chimp one }
<D>__{son, untie your mother and me! quickly! before the great bald chimp men return.}
<A>__{a small pair of chimp hands enter into the frame and struggle to untie the ropes, but to no avail. chimp two speaks.}
<C>__{chimp two }
<D>__{hurry, elijah!}
<C>__{safari man}
<D>__{why you little bastard!}
<A>__{elijah is wrestled to the ground amidst much screaming.}
