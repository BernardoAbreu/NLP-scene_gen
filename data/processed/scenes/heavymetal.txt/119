<A>__{she swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station. then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting floor, and enters a magnificent secret hideaway cut deep into the rock.}

<A>__{inside taarna's hideaway landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, taarna dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool. here she disrobes, and picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil over herself. it shines and sparkles as it touches her skin. then she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle even brighter. finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone wall. when she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal a gold chest. taarna opens it. inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments, so bright that taarna must shield her eyes for a moment. then, as she looks down at the armour, the voice of taarak the defender comes into her head.}

<A>__{avenge !! through a series of dissolves we see taarna's hands sensuously fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body. finally we pull back to see her fully. standing before us, glistening in the torch light, she looks magnificent. reaching once more into the chest, taarna pulls out a golden sword. as she holds it, it seems to vibrate, almost buzzing in her hands. suddenly she swings it, slicing cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall. as the burning torch falls to the ground, taarna leaves.}
