<L>__{interior living room same time}
<A>__{marcon stirs the fireplace logs, stoking the blaze. replaces the poker. crosses to his desk and sits. jimmy is on the carpet, delirious. out of it. marcon presses a button. an armed hardguy appears.}
<C>__{hardguy}
<D>__{mr. marcon?}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{he's nothing, he can't hurt us. take him somewhere and kill him.}
<C>__{hardguy}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{the hardguy crosses the room. grips jimmy by the shoulders. with a soft spit of sound, his forehead blooms crimson. he collapses, lifeless. at his desk, marcon whirls, stunned, as:}
<B>__{joe hallenbeck}
<A>__{steps through the french doors behind him. he resembles nothing human. a demon in black. eyes burning. gun held loosely. an extension of his arm. marcon reaches for the button to summon help.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{don't.}
<A>__{he jams the rifle barrel into marcon's throat, nearly crushing his larynx. hisses:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{the gun is silenced, i will fuckin' kill you. where's my wife?}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{i... i don't remember, i...}
<A>__{joe shoves on the gun. the barrel chokes him.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{my wife.}
<A>__{grabs a pen. shoves it in marcon's hand.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{the address. now!}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{it's... milo's film studio...}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{write it down, dumbfuck.}
<A>__{he speaks over his shoulder:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{jimmy, you okay...?}
<A>__{jimmy stirs.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{hurts like hell.}
<A>__{marcon finishes writing. hallenbeck snatches up the address. stows it in his pocket.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{okay, connie, you're gonna walk us out of here, nice and easy, got it?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can you walk, jimmy?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yeah... i think so joe, behind you...!}
<A>__{too late. a revolver is cocked a foot from joe's head.}
<C>__{strange man}
<D>__{drop it.}
<A>__{it's the same odd voice we heard earlier. the man with the speech impediment.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you drop it, asshole, or i kill marcon.}
<A>__{the strange man chuckles.}
<C>__{strange man}
<D>__{sorry, but that won't work. i don't care if he lives or dies, now drop the gun.}
<A>__{a pause. once more, joe calculates the odds. no dice. he places the rifle on the desk.}
<C>__{strange man}
<D>__{walk over there by your friend, joe.}
<A>__{hallenbeck turns around... and, for once, his jaw drops. he's looking at a man he never thought he'd see again. a man who suffers from facial paralysis ever since his head bounced off the georgetown turnpike eight years ago.}
<B>__{louis baynard}
<A>__{son of the late senator. the right side of his face doesn't quite match the left. the muscles don't work. hallenbeck recovers his composure. as jimmy climbs to his feet, joe walks over and stands next to him. two gunmen appear behind them, covering the rear.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{well, goddamn. how's the head, lou?}
<C>__{baynard }
<D>__{aside from permanent facial neuralgia, just lovely.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{next time, lou, just say no.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{shit. this is the drunk guy you slugged, look what you did to his face!}
<A>__{marcon, meanwhile, is positively livid. he snaps at baynard:}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{you son of a bitch, you were gonna let him kill me!}
<C>__{baynard}
<D>__{nothing more or less than you'd do for me, conrad.}
<P>__{(turns)}
<D>__{i never thought i'd see you again, joe.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{speaking of which, what the fuck are you doing here?}
<C>__{baynard}
<D>__{call it a financial partnership. for a price, i agreed to connect mr. marcon to the necessary people in washington.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{in other words, you dropped your father's name a bunch of times.}
<C>__{baynard}
<P>__{(ignores him)}
<D>__{but imagine my delight this morning, joe, when mr. marcon informed me of a golden opportunity: a chance to kill my father and frame you for the crime... what can i say, inherit a fortune and humiliate you in the bargain, who could resist?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{do i also have you to thank for dragging me into this mess?}
<C>__{baynard}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{it was i, unfortunately, who bought a forty dollar bottle of champagne... spoke a little too freely to that hooker.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{she wasn't a hooker, dickhead.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{he should know, jimmy. with a face like that, he's gotta be paying for it.}
<C>__{baynard}
<D>__{you can die fast or slow, so watch your mouth.}
<A>__{jimmy chimes in:}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{we'd rather watch yours. it's goofy lookin'.}
<A>__{marcon has had enough. he pounds his fist on the desk.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{kill them, goddammit, waste 'em both!}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{any bright ideas, joe?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{gimmee a minute.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{excuse me, could you give him a minute? he's trying to think of a way out of this.}
<A>__{behind them, the two hardguys cock their guns. jimmy sweats. he's scared shitless underneath. hallenbeck clears his throat:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you know of course, connie, that you're a dead man.}
<A>__{marcon holds up his hand.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{wait.}
<A>__{the gunmen lower their weapons.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{let's humor this asshole. what are you talking about?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{nothing much, just that i made a phone call from the boat on the way in.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{you called the cops? fuck it, they can't prove a thing.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{oh, but i didn't call the cops. i called the mob.}
<A>__{marcon stares at him. blinks.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{see, connie, every year, the mob rakes in two and a half billion from football bookmaking. if you succeed in making gambling legal, all that money goes to the government.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i wouldn't be surprised if they put out a contract on you. of course, i might be able to call it off.}
<A>__{marcon stares him down. a pause. then marcon smiles:}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{he's bluffing. he's not connected to the mob, what a load of horseshit. nice try, asshole.}
<P>__{(waves his hand)}
<D>__{kill them.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(plowing ahead)}
<D>__{then there's the matter of two million dollars. or didn't you know that watertight suitcases float...?}
<A>__{he once again looks marcon in the eye.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i've got your money, connie. stashed in the back of a rented subaru. we'll take you to it.}
<C>__{marcon}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{jesus, i don't believe it. this guy's a riot.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{i don't think it's working, joe. try another one.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{hell, i'm fresh out. you wanna try one, kid, go for it.}
<A>__{a pause. then, without warning, jimmy turns and slugs hallenbeck with his good arm. decks him.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{fuck you, joe, i'm not just gonna stand here and die. mr. marcon, he's lying. we do have the money, but it's not in a car, it's in a storage locker. i have the key on me. i'l hand it over if you let me go.}
<A>__{hallenbeck stares in disbelief. the kid's actually trying something.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{where is the key, jimmy?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{it's stashed in my shorts.}
<C>__{marcon}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{all right. slow and easy.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{sure. slow and easy.}
<A>__{jimmy reaches inside his jeans. slowly, cautiously pulls something out, concealed in his fist. we see, but marcon doesn't: it's a shredder shell. he holds it in his fist.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{promise you'll let me go.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{hell with that, son. hand it over or i will have you kneecapped.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{oh, yeah? well, that's too bad. see, it's one of those new plastic keys. the kind that melt...?}
<A>__{and, with that, he hurls it into the fire. so fast that nobody can see just what he threw.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i guess nobody gets the money.}
<A>__{the two hardguys rush to the fireplace.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{pull it out of there!}
<A>__{one of them grabs a pair of tongs and the shredder explodes. sprays the two hardguys. cuts them to ribbons. then, several things happen at once: everybody goes for a gun. hallenbeck lunges, scoops up a fallen pistol as marcon draws his gun and fires, missing joe returns fire, bam bam ! catches marcon in the shoulder, and meanwhile baynard draws down on jimmy, who picks up a flaming log and hurls it, knocks the shot wild, as: marcon darts out the french doors, into the night, so hallenbeck spins, fires at baynard blows him backward in a bloody spray. baynard sags against the mantel. collapses, dead. echoes. silence. jimmy and joe are alone with three corpses. jimmy snatches up a pistol. joe slings the sniper rifle over his shoulder. stares at jimmy:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{plastic keys...? the kind that melt?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{hey. short notice, best i could do.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you did fine, junior.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{learned it from a pro. come on.}
