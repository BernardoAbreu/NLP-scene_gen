<L>__{exterior planetoid sunset}
<A>__{sinister angle on the snark. as we watch, the sunlight turns the color of blood, and then the sun is down, leaving murky blackness in its wake. the ring of floodlights on the ship flares into life, feebly combatting the darkness and the storm.}
<L>__{interior multi purpose room}
<A>__{the entire crew is seated around the conference table, watching holographic pictures projected onto a screen. these are photos taken by their "datasticks" (flashlight cameras). standard is commenting on the changing slides.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{... this is the control room...}
<A>__{two or three pictures click onto the screen in succession, showing the suited men standing against banks of machinery.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{... some details of the control room...}
<A>__{the skeleton appears on the screen. the men react with mutters.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{... this is the skeleton... another view of the skeleton... the transmitting device...}
<A>__{the triangle that was cut into the alien's console appears.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{... this is a closeup of the triangle we found scrawled on the console in front of the skeleton...}
<A>__{standard changes the slide. the screen goes white.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{... and that's it.}
<A>__{he turns off the projector and brings the lights up.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{phenomenal. staggering.}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{we've got to go back and take a lot more pictures, holograph everything .}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{and bring back as much physical evidence as possible, too. the rest of the skeleton. some of the machinery. written records, if there are any.}
<A>__{roby is slumped in his chair. he has said nothing.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{martin?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{i agree. this is the single most important discovery in history.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{but?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{what killed it?}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{hell, that thing's been dead for years. maybe hundreds of years. the whole planet's dead.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{the way i figure it, they landed here for repairs or something, then they couldn't take off again. maybe the dust ruined their engines. they set up an s.o.s. beacon, but nobody came. so they died. roby he}
<A>__{died.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{not they ... he ...}
<A>__{they all turn to look in the direction of roby's nod. camera moves}
<B>__{over to reveal the alien skull sitting on a table.}
<C>__{roby }
<D>__{... there was only one skeleton.}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{jay... how's it coming on the repairs?}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{well... i'm going to have to blow the engines out...}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{and when will you be ready to do that?}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{oh i'm not near ready yet.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{then why the hell are you sitting around here?}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{the men rise and begin to disperse, but roby remains seated, deep in thought, staring at the skull. melkonis lingers in the room with him.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{and there sits man's first contact with intelligent life in the universe.}
