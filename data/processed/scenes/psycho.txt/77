<A>__{with the paper in the foreground, norman enters. we can see him in the dim spill of light. he pauses by the door, then gathers his strength and goes into the bathroom. we hear him set the pail on the tiled floor, and then we hear the shower being turned off. and there is total silence. camera moves forward so that we can see into bathroom. camera is angled that we see norman only from the waist up. quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain, emerges with it into the bedroom. camera pans down and we see him spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor, just outside the bathroom door. he spreads the curtain so that one end of it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over and onto the tile floor. again he goes into the bathroom and camera tilts up so that we see only the upper half of norman. he works carefully, with his arms extended away from his body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it across the tile floor and onto the spread out shower curtain in the bedroom. having arranged the body, he straightens up, examines his hands, sees bloodstains on them. he returns to the bathroom, goes to the hand basin.}

<A>__{we see his hands being washed, see the bloodstains being diluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water.}
<B>__{norman}
<A>__{we see norman shake his hands free of the water, then turn to the job of cleaning the bathroom. he places the pail in the tub, runs water into it, dips the mop in, swabs the tile floor. with a towel he wipes off the wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and even the shower curtain rod. then he takes a second towel and goes over the cleaned areas, carefully drying them. finally he rinses and squeezes out the mop, empties the pail, cleans out the tub, and goes out into the bedroom.}
