<L>__{interior richards' apartment day}
<A>__{karen's having some lunch. lloyd, still in his robe, sits opposite her having some coffee and a cigarette. a copy of the interview before him.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(is saying)}
<D>__{ it's addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{where'd you get all that information?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(put out his cigarette)}
<D>__{eve.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{eve?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{she's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in you just missed her...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{that was a pity...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(gets up)}
<D>__{she wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone and didn't dare face margo...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i wonder why.}
<A>__{lloyd wanders about he seems to be searching for words, for a position to maintain...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{she started to tell me all about it and she couldn't finish, she cried so...}
<A>__{he's over by a window, his back to her. karen eyes him curiously, waiting for the payoff...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{you know, i've been going over our financial condition if you'll pardon the expression...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{that's quite a change of subject.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(walks again)}
<D>__{what with taxes coming up and since i'm a playwright and not an oil well operator well, i've been thinking...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm trying hard to follow you.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{if instead of waiting until next season to do 'footsteps on the ceiling', which is in pretty good shape and if margo can be talked into going on tour with 'aged in wood' we could put 'footsteps...' into production right away...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm beginning to catch up.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{if we could cast it properly, that is...}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{maybe get some younger actress for the part? someone who'd look the part as well as play it?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you've got to admit it would be a novelty.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{now you're quoting addison. or eve.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{eve did mention the play, you know. but just in passing she's never ask to play a part like "cora," she'd never have the nerve...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{eve would ask abbott to give her costello.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{no, i got the idea myself while she was talking to me...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{with gestures, of course.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(wistfully)}
<D>__{for once, to write something and have it realized completely. for once, not to compromise }
<A>__{now karen explodes. she rises.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{lloyd richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "cora."}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{now just a minute }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{margo channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{now just a minute!}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it strikes me that eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!}
<A>__{lloyd's full of anger and guilt. he snaps back.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{all this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named dewitt! she apologized, didn't she?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{on her knees, i have no doubt! very touching, very academy of dramatic arts!}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{that bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left radcliffe!}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{the cynicism you refer to, i acquired the day i discovered i was different from little boys!}
<A>__{the phone has been ringing. lloyd snarls into it.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{hello!}
<P>__{(he quiets down)}
<D>__{... hi, margo... no, not at all, karen and i were just chatting... hmm?... why why, yes, i'm sure we can and i'm sure we'd love to... right... 11:45ish. see you then...}
<A>__{he hangs up. he smiles suddenly, there's peace.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{margo and bill want us to meet them at the cub room tonight, after theater. for a bottle of wine.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{margo in the cub room. i couldn't be more surprised if she'd said grant's tomb.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i'm glad bill's back.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{they'd die without each other.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{darling, i didn't promise eve anything. just said i thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{such as?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{you for one. i told her you were set on margo playing the part and i certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.}
<A>__{karen smiles happily.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{that's fine. fine and dandy. i'd enjoy nothing more. just refer all of miss harrington's future requests to me...}
