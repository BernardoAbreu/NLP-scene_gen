<A>__{from the back seat marshall watches mr. brooks remove the pieces of his disguise a wig, a mustache, glasses, and drop them in the carry on.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{how do you feel?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{dirty.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{that's understandable. you've never killed for this reason before. the feeling will go away.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i don't think so. it's the whole thing, marshall. if i could find a way to just disappear, where there was absolutely no trace of me; because eventually i will get caught doing this. and it'll be very embarrassing for me and emma and jane. so i've been thinking... is there a way that mr. smith could kill me and make me disappear.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{number one, mr. smith is not smart enough to do that. number two, there is no reason, if you're careful, to believe you will ever get caught.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i know i will have to plan it for mr. smith, but i think that's what i want to do.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{i'm not particularly fond of that plan, earl. remember if you die, i go with you and i like being alive. i like eating, i like fucking, i like killing.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i have to end it, marshall. one way or the other. and i think this is the best way.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{well fuck you then.}
