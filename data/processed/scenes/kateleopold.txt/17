<D>__{...of albany. he was the... is the son of emery and eliza. he was of no actual importance until he vanished at the turn of the century without a trace. it was a sensation. in the 30's they even made a movie about him. "the tenuous duke" with ronald coleman.}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<P>__{(absently)}
<D>__{i love ronald coleman.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{despite much speculation and a nation wide investigation, a body was never found. he was never heard from again.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{until now.}
<A>__{there is a stunned silence. they stare at leopold in awe.}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{we've altered the course of history.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{we never should have started this...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{calm down.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{what are we going to do? we can't keep him here. imagine if anyone found out!}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{think. just, think. rationally. now, no one would believe such a stupid mistake could be made because no one would believe any of this is possible. so. we fix this. we keep this to ourselves and we fix it. fast.}
<A>__{they all nod in agreement.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{dr. kau, research all our data. 1st priority: locate carlson. drake, determine the reciprocal correlation's connected to the 19th century. work 24 hours a day if necessary. in the meantime... one of us will have to take charge of him.}
<A>__{she forces back panic. only the tremor in her voice gives her away.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{this is a major scientific opportunity. it doesn't get any better than this. imagine. researching the behavior, the physical and emotional characteristics of a century ago! utilizing technology available to us today... he's a gold mine!}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{he's a man, kate. not a guinea pig.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{and while he's here, he's ours. any volunteers?}
<A>__{no one moves.}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{we'll draw names. whoever is is picked will be responsible. agreed?}
<A>__{they nod reluctantly. drake writes out names and throws them in a cup. the silence becomes deafening. finally:}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{i will do it.}
<A>__{all the scientists face her.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{you'll look after him?}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{no, i meant i will pick the name.}
<A>__{she reaches in. they wait with mounting suspense. finally she turns to kate. the scientists follow her gaze. a beat.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{leopold stirs. he blinks at the group.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{where...? what has happened?!}
<A>__{the doctors, caught off guard, smile benignly. they surround leopold as a group, not knowing where to begin. finally:}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{your grace... um... hello... weee aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge research team. a project funded by the government of the united states.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(regarding their}
<D>__{appearance with}
<P>__{distaste)}
<D>__{oh. americans. i see...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{yes, um... for the past six and a half years we've been conducting scientific experiments on density and flexibility in the dimensions of time and space.}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{yes, uh... quite by accident we came upon a formula utilizing tachyons... particles traveling faster than the speed of light, which allowed us to... fold time so to speak.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{yes. bend it between the cracks of the dimensions.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{they all laugh nervously. leopold does not.}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{now, while that wasn't the original purpose of our experiment, we opted to pursue it, well, privately, on our own.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{borrowing funds already provided.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{we journeyed to your time because it was the quickest path to follow. we debated long and hard whether we should use this knowledge at all. believe me, it was never our intent to disturb the past...}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{merely to discover if the expedition were possible. as your presence here confirms... we are very disturbed.}
<A>__{leopold nods at them as if they are insane.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{the problem facing us is not only how to get you back, but when, you see?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{we certainly don't want to miscalculate. send you to a different era entirely.}
<A>__{leopold starts to speak.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{rest assured, no harm will come to you. you'll be well looked after by dr. coles.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{dr. coles...? i do not follow. what do you mean, get me back home?... where am i?}
<A>__{awkward pause. leopold looks carefully around the room for the first time: modern mechanical equipment, data shifting and changing, giant cooling devices, bright neon lighting. the doctors are silent.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{answer me!...}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{would you have me believe... i am being detained, at present in the hereafter?... the time to come?}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{it is the year nineteen hundred and ninety five.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{...19...?}
<A>__{leopold leaps up. the doctors follow him around the room.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you're insane! all of you! this is impossible!}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{leopold, calm down!}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{a voyage through time! what do you take me for? did you bring me here by force?}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{we're scientist, not seditionists.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(truly panicked)}
<D>__{let me out of here! i won't stand for this another moment!}
<A>__{he's out the door.}
