<A>__{a wedge of light as berlin walks in. then moonlight again. hel ena sits at the edge of a single bed. hair a wreck and mascara streaks down her face. he sits identifying himself with an emb race. clears the hair from her eyes and kisses where the tears were. "it was an accident .. everyone has accidents." whatever he said would be the wrong thing to say. because he doesn't un derstand. and her only explanation of this misery is new tears.}

<A>__{gently he reaches down and takes off her shoos "you don't have to dress like this for me." and suddenly the mood is different. he is amongst her tears. kissing her mouth. already undressing her. her dress glides up. silk stockings. he unclips them. she feels his hands drift down her legs. hears the zip opening her dress. she returns his desire and helps him with her brassiere. he kisses her breasts and by now the camera's too close to see.}
