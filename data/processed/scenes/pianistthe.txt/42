<L>__{exterior alley and labour bureau, later dusk}
<A>__{sun just setting. from the shelter of the alleyway, szpilman continues to watch the entrance of the bureau. no mob any more, but people come and go jewish policemen, shupos, a few jews. almost continuous sounds of distant shots and screams. then, heller appears at the entrance, looks this way and that and goes back inside the building. szpilman alert. again heller appears in the entrance. he beckons someone inside. henryk shuffles out. heller shoves him into the street. henryk stumbles, falls. szpilman runs to him, helps him to his feet.}
