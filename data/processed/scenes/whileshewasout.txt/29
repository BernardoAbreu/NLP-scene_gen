<A>__{della looks on for a moment at the confrontation. she grinds out the stub of her cigarette into the ashtray, slams it closed. della shakes her head and turns left into row five. jesus! are there really this many cars in pleasant valley? it's a brand new mall and the only one around for miles but this is ridiculous. della reaches the end of row five quickly. she guessed there wouldn't be a spot so she's driving faster. she notices a portly middle aged rent a cop directing traffic ahead. she lowers her window.}

<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{the rent a cop stops directing and approaches the car.}
<D>__{rent a cop can i help you?}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{do you know where i can definitely find parking? rent a cop there's nothing close by. even the valet's backed up. you might want to try further out.}
<A>__{he points off into the distance through the sea of cars.}
<P>__{rent a cop (cont'd)}
<D>__{but be willing to walk.}
<A>__{a car waiting behind della honks its horn loudly and the rent a cop saunters away. della guns the ford down row eight.}
