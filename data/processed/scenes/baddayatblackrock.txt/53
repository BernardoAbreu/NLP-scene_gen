<D>__{you notifyin' the state po lice?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(putting a bill on the counter)}

<D>__{lemonade?}
<A>__{macreedy shakes his head. no.}
<C>__{hastings}
<P>__{(mopping his forehead)}
<D>__{it's hot as billy be durned.}
<A>__{he drinks, puts down the glass. macreedy pushes the bill across the counter toward him. hastings picks it up gingerly then pauses...}
<C>__{hastings}
<D>__{don't you like lemonade?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i never thought much about it.}
<C>__{hastings}
<D>__{it don't have the muzzle velocity of some other drinks drunk around here, but it's good for what ails you.}

<D>__{but what's the use talkin'...?}
<P>__{(with grudging respect)}
<D>__{you don't know what it's like, being scared.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(not unsympathetically)}
<D>__{you want me to describe the symptoms? right this minute i'm scared half to death.}
