<A>__{duke rams the key home swings the door open.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{ah, home at last!}
<L>__{interior hotel flamingo suite afternoon}
<A>__{duke enters. the door hits something with a thud. a 16 year old girl with the aura of an angry pit bull. gonzo stands in the bathroom doorway stark naked with a drug addled grin on his face.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{you degenerate pig!}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{it can't be helped. this is lucy.}
<P>__{(laughing distractedly)}
<D>__{you know like "lucy in the sky with diamonds."}
<A>__{lucy eyes duke venomously.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{lucy! lucy, be cool, goddamnit! remember what happened at the airport! no more of that, okay?}
<A>__{lucy keeps her eyes on duke. gonzo idles over and puts his arm round her shoulder.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{lucy... this is my client. this is mr. duke, the famous journalist. he's paying for this suite, lucy. he's on our side.}
<A>__{duke flops onto the sofa.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{mr. duke is my friend. he loves artists.}
<A>__{duke notices for the first time that the room is full of artwork. maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in charcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{lucy paints portraits of barbra streisand.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i drew these from tv.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{fantastic. she came all the way down here from montana just to give these portraits to barbra. we're going over to the americana hotel tonight to meet her backstage...}
<A>__{duke's voice rises above gonzo.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{i desperately needed peace, rest, sanctuary. i hadn't counted on this. finding my attorney on acid and locked into some kind of preternatural courtship.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{well, i guess they brought the car round by now. let's get the stuff out of the trunk.}
<A>__{duke fixes gonzo hard.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{absolutely, let's get the stuff.}
<P>__{(to lucy)}
<D>__{now, we'll be right back. don't answer the phone if it rings.}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(makes one fingered jesus freak sign)}
<D>__{god bless.}
