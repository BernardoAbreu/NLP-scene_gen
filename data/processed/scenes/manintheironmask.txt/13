<L>__{exterior the royal palace gardens day}
<A>__{attractive young adults strut about in the extravagant attire of louis xiv's france, the men like peacocks, the ladies in gowns that seem to squeeze their entire bodies up into their bosoms. they laugh and smile and strike courtly poses pretending to talk with each other but all eyes are on the doorway, through which the king is about to come...}
<B>__{just beyond that palace doorway}
<A>__{king louis the fourteenth is having his wardrobe adjusted by a flock of tailors. he is twenty two, and would be quite handsome, except for the total self absorption. he's checking himself in a full length golden mirror as two of his advisors, pierre and claude, try to speak with him.}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{your majesty, i know it is a... a festive time, but before }
<C>__{king louis}
<D>__{the blue sash. no, the burgundy!}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{... before the party begins }
<C>__{king louis}
<D>__{the party has already begun so why are you delaying me?}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{we do not wish to delay you, majesty, but... as your advisors, we feel it is our our }
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{... our duty.}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{yes! it is our duty to let you know... there are riots in paris.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{riots? my people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth. why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{well yes, of course, majesty, and i'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{sometimes the poor do grow hungry. but why would they riot about it?}
<A>__{as he says this, a replica of the matterhorn made of fruits and meringues is carried past the window by a team of chefs.}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{majesty... we have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week. if we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{aramis! i have been expecting you!}
<P>__{(to the tailors)}
<D>__{we are satisfied, that will do.}
<A>__{the tailors and advisors withdraw as aramis still in his simple priest's robe strides forward and bows to the kind.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{your birthday celebration, your majesty?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{next week. this is a mere garden party and i wish to join it, so i will be brief. i am experiencing resistance from the jesuits.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{well... perhaps you should speak with them, your majesty.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i have demanded it and common priests present themselves! can you imagine the arrogance? common jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order! no one can keep secrets like the jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold. even the pope himself does not know who leads the jesuit order in france! he suspects the governor general of jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become pope himself.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{how can i serve you in this?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the jesuits is. you are now a priest, but you were once a musketeer, serving the throne of france, a throne ordained of god. can you accept this mission, and keep it private?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{if i find out the identity of this jesuit rebel. i will kill both him and the man who told me.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{once a musketeer, always a musketeer, eh?}
<A>__{aramis bows and louis turns back to his mirror. there are mirrors everywhere in his palace, and he loves his reflection, adorned as he is all in golden cloth, like fabric from the sun. aramis leaves and the advisors return.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{ah yes, the riots. we have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{that food has spoiled. that is why it was not shipped to the army.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{exactly why it should be given away.}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{what... an excellent idea, your majesty!}
