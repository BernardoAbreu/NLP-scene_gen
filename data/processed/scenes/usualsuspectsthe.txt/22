<L>__{interior cell block}
<A>__{keaton is brought in to a holding where he joins fenster, hockney, verbal and mcmanus. he sits in a corner and keeps to himself. fenster is in mid tirade.}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{somebody should do something. what is this shit getting hauled in every five minutes? okay, so i did a little time, does that mean i get railed every time a truck finds its way off the planet?}
<A>__{mcmanus is silently staring at keaton, who sits on a bench, looking away.}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{these guys got no probable cause.}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{you're fuckin' a right, no p.c. well screw p.c. no right. no goddamn right. you do some time, they never let you go. treat me like a criminal, i will end up a criminal.}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{you are a criminal.}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{why you gotta go and do that? i'm trying to make a pointerior}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{then make it. christ, you're making me tired all over.}
<A>__{mcmanus looks at keaton.}
<D>__{mcmanus i heard you were dead, keaton.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{you heard right.}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{the word i got is you hung up your spurs, man. what's that all about? mcmanus what's this?}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{rumor has it, keaton's gone straight cleaning house. i hear he's tapping edie finneran. mcmanus who?}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{she's a heavy weight criminal lawyer from uptown. big time connected. she could erase dillinger's record if she tried. i hear she's keaton's meal ticket.}
<P>__{(to keaton)}
<D>__{is it true? mcmanus}
<A>__{what about it, keaton? you a lawyer's wife. what sort of "retainer" you giving her? keaton shoots mcmanus a fiery glare.}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{i'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, mcmanus.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{do your friend a favor, fenster, keep him quiet . mcmanus you're clean, keaton? say it ain't so. was it you that hit that truck?}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{forget him. it's not important. i was trying to make a pointerior}
<C>__{keaton}
<P>__{(ignoring mcmanus)}
<D>__{this whole thing was a shakedown. mcmanus what makes you say that?}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{how many times have you been in a line up? it's always you and four dummies. the p.d. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. no way they'd line five felons in the same row. no way. and what the hell is a voice line .up? a public defender could get you off of that.}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{so why the hell was i hauled in and cavity searched tonight?}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{it was the feds. a truck load of guns gets snagged, customs comes down on n.y.p.d. for some answers they come up with us. they're grabbing at straws. it's politics nothing you can do.}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{i had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.}

<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{fuck who did it. what i want to know is, who's the gimp?}
<A>__{all eyes suddenly turn on verbal. he has been quietly listening the whole time without uttering a word.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{he's alright.}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{how do i know that? how about it, pretzel man? what's your story?}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{his name is verbal kinterior i thought you guys knew him. mcmanus verbal?}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{roger really. people say i talk too much.}
<C>__{hockney}

<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{so you did it?}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{to your mother's ass.}
<A>__{verbal looks away from hockney, awaiting a violent response. everyone slowly starts to laugh. hockney looks as if he is about to boil in his own skin.}
<C>__{keaton}
<P>__{(to hockney)}
<D>__{let it go.}
<A>__{verbal smiles at keaton appreciatively. mcmanus stands and walks to the toilet in the corner of the cell. he starts taking a leak;}
<D>__{mcmanus look, we've all been put out by this, i figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity. now fenster and i got wind of a possible job }
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{why don't you just calm down'}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{what do you care what he says? mcmanus yeah, i'm just talking here, and hockney seems to want to hear me out. i know fenster is with me }
<P>__{(to verbal)}
<D>__{how about you, guy?}
<A>__{mcmanus finishes pissing.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{i'm interested, sure. mcmanus there, so you see, i'm going to exercise my right to free assembly.}
<A>__{mcmanus taps the bars of his cell and the others laugh.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{i'm not kidding. shut your mouth. mcmanus}
<A>__{you're missing the pointerior}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{no, you're missing the pointerior shut up. i don't want to hear anything you have to say. i don't want to know about your "job". just don't let me hear you. i want nothing to do with any of you }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i beg your pardon but all of you can go to hell. mcmanus dean keaton, gone the high road. what is the world coming to?}
<A>__{mcmanus and keaton stare at one another for a long and tense moment. finally mcmanus turns to the others.}
<P>__{mcmanus (cont'd)}
<D>__{forget him then.}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{now i can't talk about this here in any detail, but listen up...}
<A>__{everyone but keaton gravitates toward mcmanus's cell as he begins to speak in low, hushed tones.}
<C>__{verbal }
<D>__{and that was how it began. the five of us brought in on a trumped up charge to be leaned on by half wits. what the cops never figured out, and what i know now, was that these men would never break, never lie down, never bend over for anybody. .. anybody.}
