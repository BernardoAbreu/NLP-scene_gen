<L>__{exterior telyatinki compound. day}
<A>__{valentin rides into the compound. a number of the disciples are outside working. there is the ringing of metal on wood. he looks for the source. as the way clears a little, he sees masha chopping away with an axe. he stops his horse to watch her.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{you're finished for the day?}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{he didn't need me this afternoon.}
<A>__{he gets down off his horse. masha continues to chop. he picks up an axe, holds it awkwardly.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{leo nikolayevich disapproves of women doing physical labor.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{don't you find that reactionary?}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{no, i find it sweet. i find you reactionary.}
<A>__{she laughs. valentin picks up a log, sets it on end and begins to chop. he doesn't do it well. masha smiles at his struggle.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{he admires you, i believe.}
<A>__{what's she saying?}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{sergeyenko told me. he's miserable about it.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{tolstoy's kind to everyone.}
<A>__{the log is stuck to the blade of his axe. he's really struggling now.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{what do you talk about when you're with him?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why are you blushing?}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{we talk about me.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{he wants to know everything about me, my parents, my relations with women, my experience of god }
<A>__{he looks up to see masha smiling at him.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{and what relations are these?}
<A>__{valentin blushes, goes back to trying to chopping. almost immediately the log becomes stuck to the blade of the axe. he bangs it, bangs it trying to free it. he glances up to see her still looking at him. he pounds again and again. she stops, reaches for his axe, touching him as she does. she lifts the big axe, log and all, above her head, bringing it down hard. the log splits. she hands the axe to him.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{i had a lover before i came here... headmaster of a school where i taught. he was married happily married. it was difficult. we could make love only at school.}
<A>__{this is somehow more than valentin had bargained for.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{at school?}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{in the gymnasium, after the girls had gone. there were straw mats on the floor.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{i see...}
<A>__{he looks away to hide his confusion.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{have i upset you?}
<A>__{he looks at her.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{no...i appreciate your frankness}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{but you disapprove of me. i see it in your eyes.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{i don't. not at all...i think sexual activity...how men and women combine their physical parts is completely neutral.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{listen to you. you're a prig. just like sergeyenko. why else would they have hired you?}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{that's not fair}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{i don't care if it's fair. it's true...neutral...my god...}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{i'm going.}
<A>__{he puts down the axe.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{do as you like.}
<A>__{she goes back to chopping. we track in front of him as he walks toward the house. the chopping stops.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{valentin fedorovich.}
<A>__{he stops, relieved and turns to face her.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{you forgot your horse.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{yes. you know, i think that i... never mind.}
<A>__{he hesitates for a moment, then starts toward her. her back is to him. she begins to chop again. the color rises in his face as he tries to salvage a little dignity. he grabs the reins and starts again toward the buildings, trips in a ditch, almost falls flat. red faced, he rights himself. the chopping behind him remains constant. sergeyenko watches him from the porch.}
