<A>__{amee skitters along. moving fast. climbs up and ever so carefully peers over the ridgeline. amee's pov the cosmos down below. and beneath it, his feet sticking out as he works on something, gallagher. he messed with her once; she recognizes him. if she could bare her teeth like an angry dog, she would. amee considers for a moment. makes her move.}
<L>__{exterior cosmos site night}
<A>__{she comes down the hill. twelve, sixteen, twenty foot strides. doing forty or fifty miles an hour easy. and all but silently. gallagher hasn't yet responded. and then she's all the way to him. she rears up to strike and and gallagher, in his skivvies, bursts up from where he's buried himself in the sand, avenging, entrenching tool high over his head, already swinging as amee wheels back around and...he chops off both her eyes. sidesteps as she rushes him blindly and backhands her in her electronic marine cranium from behind. whatever he's hit, the jolt stiffens his arm, throws him off. the tool stays embedded. she runs headlong into the cosmos. smashes, stumbles, falls. and before she can get back up to her feet...he wraps the sleeve of his shirt around his hand, rescues the entrenching tool and deals a death stroke to the silver arachnid.}

<D>__{robust real time response to the environment, my butt.}
<A>__{gallagher grabs his satchel of tools and begins to unbolt her as fast as he can. checks his watch. whatever he's racing, there's only minutes to go. deep within the electronic entrails of amee, he dredges up her esource. size of a soda can. power cell that runs her for year and a half. hums as he removes it from its shielded container. it's 280 volts.}

<D>__{work.}
<A>__{he rips open a panel on the cosmos, yanks out the dead cell and hooks the new one in. it doesn't fit. he's got nothing left but a couple of wrenches and a tube of epoxy. glues it in place. runs the launch diagnostics on his hcc. it flickers, goes to yellow, flashes on and off to green. he yanks back on his suit. grabs a handful of the uncharred worms and seals them in the container that held the esource. stuffs it in a side pocket. looks at the top of srv. wedges himself under some cables and wiring on the top.}
