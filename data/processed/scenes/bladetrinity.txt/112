<A>__{ wham! blade tosses hoop, a skinny familiar, off a roof. it's a four story drop. hoop falls, screaming but then jerks to a stop about twenty feet down, dangling upside down. we see now that hoop has rope tied around one of hoop's ankles. and blade is clutching the other end of the rope. blade hauls hoop back up but still keeps him dangling upside down. king and abigail look on.}
