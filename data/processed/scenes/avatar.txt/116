<A>__{they fly in close formation with tsu'tey and the young hunters, 5 banshees flashing through scarves of mist. another day. jake dives, playing hide and seek with neytiri among the clouds. they are wild and free in a wild world. she grins and banks hard, diving catch me if you can. he dives after her. in the grotto, by firelight, jake's banshee snaps at a piece of meat which he playfully pulls back. he's teaching it to take the food more slowly. he strokes its long head. tsu'tey is nearby with the young hunters. he eyes jake with frustrated hostility. another day jake and neytiri fly abreast, soaring easily. she points and jake sees a bizarre geological formation. arches of magnetic rock form rainbows of stone above a deep caldera. in the center of the caldera is a single, enormous willow tree, gnarled and ancient. this, we will be told, is the well of souls.}
