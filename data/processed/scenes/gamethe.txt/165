<A>__{christine pours a cup of coffee from a metal pot on a wood burning stove in which a fire crackles. this cabin is genuinely rustic and run down hewn wood, fishing rods, cobwebs, rain damage, dust. water drips from the ceiling in a few places. lightning flashes in bg through the scene, the storm has gotten pretty bad. schuyler finishes taking out his contacts, dropping them in cups full of water. he slips on his glasses, then looks at a few framed family photos on the coffee table in front of him. christine, barefoot, brings him a cup of coffee, which he sips gratefully.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{you're not having any?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{never drink it. makes my tits hurt.}
<A>__{schuyler gives her a sidelong glance, looks back at a photo. on photo he rubs away the dust from a shot showing schuyler's father, with young schuyler, on a boat with fishing equipment. christine takes a step and cries out, clutching her foot and sitting beside schuyler. a small fishhook protrudes from her foot,}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{hold still.}
<A>__{he talks while he carefully removes the hook from her foot.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{sorry, this place hasn't been cleaned in a while. my dad built it himself, spent a lot of time here alone.}
<P>__{(regards a leak)}
<D>__{rotten carpenter...}
<A>__{he pulls out the hook, puts it aside; she rubs her foot.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{schuyler suddenly starts laughing, wipes tears from his eyes.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{what's so funny?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{just private joke...}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{well... i always told myself i wasn't gonna end up like him. and now here i am, running his corporation, living in his house, hiding in the cabin where he went to hide right before he... i even look like the bastard.}
<A>__{christine looks at the photo of mr. van orton, then at schuyler.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{not that much.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{mm, plus i'm a helluva lot more gullible than he ever was...}
<A>__{the cell phone chirps, schuyler shakes off his self pity, snatches up the handset.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{christine mouths, "who is it?"}
<C>__{plympton }
<P>__{(careful, worried)}
<D>__{it's me, schuyler... i got your message... i will admlt, i was very disturbed...}
<C>__{schuyler}
<P>__{(hand over phone)}
<D>__{my, lawyer.}
<P>__{(to plympton)}
<D>__{so. what's our next move?}
<A>__{during the following, christine's eyes go wide, she shakes her head frantically, draws a finger across her throat }
<C>__{plympton }
<D>__{i've been on the phone all morning... your funds are intact, nothing's changed, there's been no activity whatsoever...}
<A>__{schuyler struggles to absorb the import of this as well as christine's behavior. she shakes her head with a sigh, rises to refill his coffee cup.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{wait that's not true }
<C>__{plympton }
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{it is true, no one is after your money, no one is trying to hurt you }
<A>__{schuyler looks at christine with horror. she nods and whispers:}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{he's in on it.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{oh, god...}
<C>__{plympton }
<D>__{listen to me, sky!}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{what are they paying you, robert? piece of the action?}
<C>__{plympton }
<D>__{schuyler! look, you've done the right thing going up there, maybe it's best if you just sit tight for a while, forget about everything, it's all under control }
<A>__{schuyler hangs up, breathing hard, pacing, clutching the phone.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{we have to get out of here!}
<A>__{christine approaches him with a fresh cup of coffee, which he sips. the phone chirps again, schuyler throws it violently against the wall, it's silenced. he gulps more coffee, rising again, looking at the smashed phone, sickened by his own loss of control.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{well, that was stupid.}
<A>__{christine watches him closely. he keeps balling his hands into fists as he paces, trying to think out his next play.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{ok, they've gotten to him. ok. is there anyone i can trust?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{mm... i wouldn't worry about it.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{it's out of your hands.}
<A>__{he takes a step, stumbles, shakes his head to clear it. she rises, picks up his half empty cup and heads for the kitchen area. his gaze follows this, he realizes he's been drugged.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{christine!!}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{that's not my name.}
<A>__{with a cry of rage he lunges after her, but crashes into the wall, clutching at a hanging rod, which falls when he does he knocks over the table of photos as he goes down, panting for air like a fish out of water, clutching his stomach, nauseated. his pov sideways, low angle. sfx, blood pounding in his head. schuyler's eyes follow the grooves of the wet, warped hardwood floor, they lead to and almost seem to point to christine. another angle, close from the counter she picks up a small vial with a bit of powder at the bottom, slips it into her pocket. schuyler's eyes roll into his head as he struggles against the effects, tries to get to his hands and knees. he gasps:}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{why...}
<A>__{christine approaches, stands a few feet away, lights a cigarette,}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{we needed you to call your banks. cellular calls can be intercepted, rerouted, y'know.}
<A>__{she crouches by him, flicking ashes a few inches from his nose.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{all those calls to switzerland and chase manhattan you were talking to our people. see, we were still missing a lotta pieces access codes, passwords, stuff even plyrnpton didn't have but now we have i everything. i guess you are pretty fucking stupid but thanks.}
<A>__{he claws at her helplessly with a groan, but misses. his glasses fall off, he collapses again. schuyler's pov everything a blur now, except in extreme fg the photo of himself and his father, which now lies on the floor.}
