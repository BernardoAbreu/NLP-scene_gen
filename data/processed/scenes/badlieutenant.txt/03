<A>__{the car is obviously lt's home away from home. food debris, beer cans, vodka bottles and other garbage litter the interior. an impressive hand gun is visible between the seats. an old icon of mother mary rides on the dashboard. as the twins get in, lt tries to hide the gun and the illicit detritus. to little avail. the twins pay no mind to his machinations; they have evidently seen it all before. as lt drives the twins to school, the three play wild rough house. the car swerves crazily.}

<A>__{lt and the twins banter back and forth, poke each other and box around. the apparent hostility of their words is balanced by the laughter and gung ho play of the rough housing. the twins yell cat calls as they drive past a blonde pedestrian. lt joins in. angle through the windshield, the parochial school comes into view. a crowd of uniformed kids is gathered outside. several nuns turn the crowd into two neat rows, and usher the kids inside. pov lt the nuns}
