<L>__{interior white grocery store later that morning}
<A>__{minny and aibileen, in uniform, push carts side by side in the grocery store. the white shoppers are dressed casually. other maids in the store (all required to be in uniform while shopping) keep quietly to themselves. white women smile and chat with one another as they meander down the aisles as if the black maids aren't even there. minny suddenly spots celia in the produce section. she pulls aibileen close as they peer around the corner.}
<C>__{minny}
<D>__{that's her.}
<A>__{aibileen's mouth drops open at the sight of celia's shorts and tight sweater. celia is having trouble selecting produce.}
<C>__{minny }
<D>__{lord, she's trying to shop.}
<A>__{celia walks up to a maid, grabs her, and pulls her to the tomatoes. the maid, clearly uncomfortable, selects a tomato, hands it to celia, and scurries away.}
<C>__{celia}
<P>__{(shouts out)}
<D>__{thanks, doll!}
<C>__{minny}
<D>__{miss celia just don't see `em. the lines. not between us, miss hilly, nobody.}
<A>__{aibileen just nods.}
<C>__{minny }
<D>__{what you so quiet for? i know you got a opinion `bout all this.}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{you gone accuse me a philosophizing.}
<C>__{minny}
<D>__{i ain't afraid a no philosophy.}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{i don't believe in lines anymore. lines is in our heads `cause people like miss hilly try to make us believe they there.}
<A>__{celia squeezes a canteloupe with another scared maid.}
<C>__{minny}
