<L>__{interior ballroom night}
<A>__{phillippe enters the ballroom, and the reappearance of the "king" draws new attention. everyone in the dazzling ballroom seems to stop and look straight at phillippe. phillippe freezes. stares, everywhere, stares! for what seems an eternity, he can't move. but then he raises his hand and says }
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{continue.}
<A>__{as if by magic the music plays, the dancing resumes. phillippe moves to the throne and takes his place upon it. he seems to have made it; people glance dancing ladies, young musketeers, old advisors but no one gives him a second look. for a moment, phillippe feels safe. and then he sees michelle, her eyes glassy and riveted upon him. she wears her most beautiful gown the first one louis gave her but one shoulder strap dangles sloppily. her lips and cheeks are awkwardly rouged, her hair is mussed; she is drunk. she weaves her way to him and curtsies elaborately.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{my gracious noble lord...}
<A>__{phillippe's heart is pounding; he looks around for help. he can only guess who this woman is. the advisors have now noticed her; claude quickly dispatches orders to keep the party going along, and waves guards over.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{how are you... michelle?}
<A>__{she doesn't react, so he must have guessed right; but phillippe knows nothing of what happened just before the ball, and he's ambushed by her anger.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{how should i be? i came to give this back to you.}
<A>__{she starts tearing off her dress. claude and the guards reach her; the young musketeers grabbing her.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{fret not with this, your majesty }
<A>__{but michelle fights, slapping, clawing and when one of the young musketeers grabs her from behind, his arm to her throat, phillippe jumps up.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{stop! you're hurting her!}
<A>__{phillippe's face shows something louis' never did: compassion. he looks into michelle's eyes.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{however i have wronged you i will make amends. whatever the cost.}
<A>__{phillippe could not have said anything more unlike louis; everyone who heard the remark claude, the guards, and especially michelle stare at him in frozen amazement. phillippe realizes his blunder; they've caught him. the music stops. but the attention is not directed at the throne; all eyes shift to the main doorway, where anne has appeared. she is indescribably beautiful; she wears a bright gown, her hair is brushed and bejeweled, she radiates the light of a woman who felt old at thirty and who has discovered, at forty, that she is more stunning than ever. her arrival draws even more attention than the reappearance of the king; everyone watches transfixed as she approaches. phillippe sees her his mother. he stands on legs that seem to have no bones. his mother. she moves to him, her eyes filling with tears. when she is almost to the throne, phillippe falls to his knees before her and kisses her hand. no one can believe it, not from this king. yet the moment strikes them as beautiful, and they applaud happily. phillippe and the queen mother rise, and guide each other depending on each other for support, to a seat, he on the throne, she on a seat the servants place beside him. phillippe gives a wave.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{continue.}
<A>__{the ball continues, the music exuberant. michelle wanders away, like a blind lamb. phillippe and his mother sit side by side, holding hands, their reunion passing in private between their clasped hands, and glistening in their eyes.}
