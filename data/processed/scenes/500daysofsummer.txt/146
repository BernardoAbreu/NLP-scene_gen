<L>__{int boardroom later}
<A>__{tom sits next to mckenzie and across from vance. he's in his usual boardroom position, which is to say, near comatose. a female co worker, 50s, stands at the front of the room in mid presentation, showing slides that have something to do with a cat in various poses. first we see, "cat reaching up for out of reach milk bowl."}
<D>__{co worker this one says "go for it!"}
<A>__{she clicks to the next slide. "cat hanging from tree branch."}
<D>__{co worker this one says "don't give up!"}
<A>__{click. we see "cat considering a giant leap."}
<D>__{co worker and this one says "you can do it!" we have a whole line of inspirational cards featuring pickles, my cat. i think people will really enjoy them. thank you.}
<A>__{she takes her seat.}
<C>__{vance.}
<D>__{good job rhoda, i agree. really inspirational stuff. now, who's nexterior we haven't heard from "sympathy" in a while. hansen...}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(reacting to his name)}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{vance.}
<D>__{the winter collection. you have anything to contribute?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{uh...no. i really don't.}
<C>__{vance.}
<D>__{you have nothing?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well i wouldn't say nothing... actually, that's about right.}
<C>__{vance.}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{oh...k. we'll come back to you. mckenzie }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you know what...?}
<C>__{vance.}
<D>__{yes tom.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{can i say something about the cat?}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{well sure. go ahead.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this here is, and rhoda, you know i mean no disrespect... but this... this is total shit.}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<D>__{tom!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{"don't give up?" "you can do it?"}
<A>__{he points to the screen, still showing the "cat about to leap" image.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this isn't inspirational. it's suicidal. he tries that jump, i'm writing a sympathy card for that cat. that's the last thing i want to be doing with my life. it's bad enough writing these things for people.}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{hansen, this is a place of business. we don't cut down our co workers }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{that's cause we're liars! it's what we do here. why don't we level with people? stop feeding them nonsense?}
<P>__{co worker (rhoda)}
<D>__{we're a greeting card company.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yes but think about it! why do people buy these things? not to say how they feel. there's paper and pens for that. people give these cards when they can't say how they feel. or they're afraid to. and we provide the service that lets `em get away with that!}
<A>__{tom is getting excited. the rest of the room is growing uncomfortable.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i say to hell with it! let's level with america. or at least make them speak for themselves! i mean, seriously, what's this...}
<P>__{(picks a card off the table)}
<D>__{"i'm sorry to hear your grandmother has passed." what the hell? let's give em some truth. something like, "sorry to hear about your grandmother. here's a card so i get some credit in your time of need. i'm sure it makes up for the fact that grandma's dead."}
<A>__{vance and the card writing team are appalled.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{think about it.}
<P>__{(picks up another card)}
<D>__{"congratulations on your new baby." eh... how bout... "congratulations on your new baby... guess that's it for hanging out. nice knowing ya, buddy."}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{hansen, sit down!}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(picks up a card)}
<D>__{wait, what's this? ooh... fancy! look at this one with all the hearts. let's open it up. "happy valentine's day, sweetheart. i love you." oh that's nice.}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<D>__{tom...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{if someone gave me this card, mr. vance... i would eat it.}
<C>__{mckenzie}
<D>__{tom!}
<A>__{tom recognizes he's losing his shit. he takes a seat on the boardroom table.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's these greeting cards, sir, these cards, these movies, these pop songs. they're responsible for all the lies, the heartache, everything! we're responsible!}
<A>__{everyone shifts in their seats.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i think we do a bad thing here. people should be able to say how they feel, how they really feel, without some strangers putting words in their mouths. the truth. a card is a nice thought but it shouldn't do the dirty work for you. you love someone, tell them yourself, in your own words. maybe it's not love at all. maybe there's no such thing as love. maybe it's... "galoogoo."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yeah i made it up, so what?!}
<A>__{tom gets up and walks to the door.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's all crap. we make and peddle crap. and sometimes people believe in this crap. i just can't do it anymore, mr. vance. there's enough bullshit in the world without my help. i quit.}
<A>__{and with that he gets up and walks off. the room is pretty stunned. someone coughs. mckenzie tries to start a clap. it doesn't really take.}
