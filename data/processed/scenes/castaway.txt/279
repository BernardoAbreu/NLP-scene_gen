<A>__{chuck walks through the cemetery late at night. he comes to his gravestone, stares for a long moment at the inscription, then takes out a spray can of paint and puts a handprint on it. he gets back on his bicycle and rides away.}

<L>__{exterior freeway day}
<A>__{chuck negotiates an overpass crossing an interstate highway. headed in both directions, cars whoosh by beneath him.}
<L>__{exterior highway dusk later}
<A>__{chuck rides down a narrow road, shrouded in mist. moss drips from the trees reaching over the road. a car goes by. then another, their lights like halos in the fog. it's a mystical scene, a passage.}
