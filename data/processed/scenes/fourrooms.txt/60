<A>__{the elevator door opens and ted wheels out his tray into the hallway. there's been a bit of an effort to make himself appear a bit less disheveled than in the last scene. he's only minorly successful in the attempt. his uniform still looks like shit, his hair looks tousled, and he walks with a limp. he wheels the cart up to the penthouse door and knocks at the door. a woman opens the door, it's angela from alex's story.}
