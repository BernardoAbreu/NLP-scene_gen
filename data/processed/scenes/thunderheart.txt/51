<L>__{exterior wounded knee memorial day}
<A>__{maggie's old pick up is parked near an arch gate of the tiny cemetery where a tall monument is fenced off from other graves there are tobacco offerings and other medicines hanging on the fence and on the monument. it is a quiet place. still. maggie stands before the unkempt monument in her denim jacket, her hair blowing across her face in the wind. she prays in}
<B>__{lakota.}
<A>__{behind her ten children from the bear creek school stand, heads bowed respectfully. two of them sit on the lap of richard yellow bird who looks on from his wheelchair, praying quietly with maggie. when maggie completes her prayer, she ties some tobacco to the monument then turns and faces the children. one of them, a little girl heavy set raises a hand that we might note is deformed. as many of the children we have seen on the res, are.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{are they all right under here?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{two hundred and sixty seven men, women, old people. and little ones like you. many killed running along that road you see there.}
<C>__{little boy}
<D>__{where were they runnin' to?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{a place called the stronghold.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{they died for a dream. but you live. you are their great great grandchildren and you live. we have to honor their dream. of protecting the mother earth. and being proud of being indian.}
<C>__{little boy}
<D>__{my mother told me that they call us indians cuz columbus was lookin' for india when he discovered our country.}
<A>__{maggie smiles at the boy.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{yeah, well, let me tell you something, henry: just be glad he wasn't looking for turkey.}
<A>__{the children laugh. all but one boy, who isn't paying attention. he is staring up at a hill, off in the distance. maggie's pov: on the hill, a figure stands, hands in his pockets, hair blowing in the wind. ray. reverse maggie keeping her eyes on the wasi'cu, but addressing yellow bird.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{richard. sing the honoring song with them. i will be right back.}
<B>__{on the hill}
<A>__{ray stands, watching maggie walking into the wind, toward him. behind her an honoring song, sung by ten children haunts the still air. he doesn't budge as she mounts the gentle bluff and joins him there.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{we're praying at the grave. do you wanna join us?}
<A>__{a long silence. the voices carry in the wind.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no, maggie. but you're gonna have to join me for a ride. i'm taking you to rapid city.}
<A>__{maggie looks at him. they lock eyes.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{so much power. i see it in your eyes. this... hunger for power. or for what you think is power.}
<A>__{as if exhausted by the thought, maggie sits down on the bluff, looking out at the children who are still singing the song. as she speaks, she begins digging her fingers in the earth. ray stands over her.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you burned an american flag today. and left it for me...}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{ you desecrated it, it had to be burned.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i desecrated it?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{you forced an innocent man to run like an animal. you've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters i never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. and now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{in your eyes, that's power.}
<A>__{maggie lifts herself onto her knees and looks down into the small hole she's dug. she picks up a little pine cone.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{so i plant this tree for you. and i take all this stuff that you've laid on me and my people, and i put it in this hole with this pine cone.}
<P>__{(she covers it)}
<D>__{and i bury it. cuz ya know what it is, ray? bullshit. and shit is fertilizer.}
<P>__{(she stands)}
<D>__{and the mother will turn your lies into something that lives.}
<A>__{maggie rises, dusting off her hands. she looks him in the soul.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{that's what power is, in the indian way.}
<P>__{(holds her hands out to be cuffed)}
<D>__{take me to rapid, ray. i'm the enemy.}
<A>__{ray just stares at her, struggling with what he's feeling, what he's hearing. what he's supposed to be feeling. silence hangs between the two of them.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{if i told you... that i think jimmy's innocent... but i'm in over my head... would you believe me?}
<A>__{maggie looks at him, considering. then toward the long dark silhouette of a mountain range across the plains.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{see those black hills out there, ray? when the people lost the land in 1868, the government took everything but those hills. they allowed us to keep those black hills, to live there. signed a treaty. until they found gold. then they told us we had to leave because of national interest. they broke that treaty. anyone who fought or spoke out against it, wound up dead or in jail. and the people wound up here. on a reservation.}
<A>__{while she looks off at paha sapa, ray stares at her profile.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{while up there, in the black hills... they carved the faces of four presidents.}
<A>__{she looks at ray with an ironic smile, and she catches him transfixed.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{your relatives must've taught you something.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(after thought)}
<D>__{my father never told anybody he had indian blood. but he still used a few indian words around the house. he called me washee. said it meant... good boy.}
<A>__{maggie starts giggling.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{wa shee is like... a dumpling. like tallow we put in stew. i think he was calling you chubby boy.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{maggie is laughing as she looks back at the children who are no longer singing. ray reaches inside his jacket and takes out five polaroids. he shuffles them as he ponders. he hands one to maggie who has caught herself opening up too much to the wasi'cu.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you ever see that car before?}
<A>__{maggie looks at the first photo and says nothing. she hands it back quickly. ray won't take it.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{who's it belong to?}
<A>__{maggie ignores him. ray studies her reaction.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{help me, maggie...}
<A>__{maggie is looking away. she picks a long blade of grass and smoothes it in her hands. ray looks at her a moment longer then rises, dusting off his jeans, and standing there. he thinks for a long moment, pinches the bridge of his nose, then looks out at the black hills, pensive.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i didn't see you today, maggie.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{maggie watches him go. looks away. then watches him again.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{goodbye... wa shee.}
<A>__{ray stops. she stands on the bluff, her hair riding the wind and her eyes searing. and then her lips do something that might qualify as half a smile. a sense of humor rising up through anger. survival humor. ray looks at her for a long moment. and then he walks on, leaving her there.}
