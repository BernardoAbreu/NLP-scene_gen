<A>__{michael is still in the hall holding mary very clumsily in his arms. he is anxious. he realizes she's soaked. this disgusts him. he holds her at arm's length; she squirms. he goes and gets a towel from the bathroom, spreads it out on the living room couch and lays the baby down on it. mary screams she much prefers michael's arms to the couch. a panicky michael picks her up again, grumbling.}

<D>__{okay, okay, don't cry like that... i will hold you, i will hold you.}
<A>__{he tries rather unsuccessfully to wrap the towel around the child. obviously michael is very put off by the smell coming from mary.}
