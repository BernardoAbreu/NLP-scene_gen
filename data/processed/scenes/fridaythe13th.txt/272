<L>__{interior larder night}
<A>__{there is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices. alice's hands fasten onto the inside lock the dead bolt type which requires a key to unlock it from the other side. alice relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside. as soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam. then we hear some shuffling around outside. the lights are turned on.}

<D>__{please kill her, mommy... help me, please. kill her, mommy.}
<A>__{there is the sound of pots being rustled through. then the sound of another door being slammed. alice relaxes again. then there is a silence. alice thinks about unlocking the door now. she reaches out for the lock. then thinks better of the idea. she cases down the door frame to the floor. on all sides are the cans of food and cooking implements. there is a large skillet, some bags of flour, etc. alice covers her head with her arms. the doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very slowly. we see it, but she does not. mrs. voorhees' hand finishes turning and now starts to push gently. there is almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested. the voice on the other side is very young, very sing song.}

<D>__{come out, come out, wherever you are...}
<A>__{alice jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small room. fists bang in a rage on the floor.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{alice folds her hands at the side of her face. the fist banging gives way to a short silence. the silence is interrupted by a new sound: mrs. voorhees has begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the door to the larder. reaction shot: alice... oh, my god... at first we see nothing on our side. then, gradually, we see little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops. alice's eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense, anything... larger holes are now made. mrs. voorhees stops just long enough to take a peck inside. we can see her eye at the largest hole. she goes back to whacking away at the door. the hole is near the lock. it is soon big enough for mrs. voorhees to reach inside with her hand and turn the rachet. alice realizes she must defend herself. she reaches down and picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, alice raises her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to come through the entrance. mrs. voorhees chops down with the machete. alice fends off the blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her head. as the machete blade bounces off the skillet, alice is able to swing the skillet downward and hit mrs. voorhees with a solid blow on top of her head. mrs. voorhees sprawls sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the floor. alice raises the skillet again to strike. she crosses carefully to mrs. voorhees and pushes her gently with her foot, the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway. another angle: mrs. voorhees lies totally inert. there is a small puddle of blood under her head. angle on alice: she relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses slowly out of the room.}
