<L>__{exterior street bazaar evening}
<A>__{the bazaar is loud and colorful, a cacophony of arabic fills the air. the bazaar is filled with vendors actively selling their wares to each passerby, literally shoving them in the faces of prospective customers. epps, wes and jaeger walk along side by side looking almost like the three musketeers, except that wes is droning on.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{...and it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone. it's considered offensive.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you know so much about the middle east, you know where we can get something to eat.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{when do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i'm saying don't do it accidently.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{oh yeah. accidently.}
<A>__{jaeger lifts his leg and purposefully points the bottom of his foot at a vendor.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i'm sorry. my foot accidently jumped up in the air where you could see the bottom of it. i hate it when that happens.}
<A>__{(wes slaps jaeger's leg down.)}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{come on. you're going to get us in trouble.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{it was an accident. you saw it was an accident.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i'm just trying to help you guys out. it doesn't hurt to know something about saudi arabia.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{like learning arabic? you're gonna learn arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i didn't learn arabic because we were getting shipped here. you don't learn it in a couple of weeks. i studied it in high school.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{spanish wasn't hard enough?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i thought it would be good to know.}
<C>__{jager}
<D>__{yeah, if you ever need to buy a rug.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{hey, jaeger. why don't you try this:}
<A>__{ashra ka mahari dahra sahib.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{don't shoot me, i'm friendly. you can use that when you surrender.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{how do you say "come here, baby. i'm horny." i can use that now.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{don't even try it. you offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{don't worry about jaeger. he uses his personality as a form of birth control.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{blow me. have i said that to you guys recently? blow me.}
<A>__{as epps and wes walk on jaeger notices something on a vendor's table. it is a small, square box slightly larger than a man's palm fashioned of wood and metal. it is not particularly ornate, but eye catching in its own way. the instant jaeger picks it up and begins to look it over the vendor is giving him the hard sell in arabic. jaeger holds the box up to the vendor.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what is this?}
<A>__{all he gets is more arabic. jaeger calls over to wes.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{hey, wes. wes!}
<A>__{wes comes back over to jaeger.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{now you need me.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what is it? you know so much about arabland tell me what it is.}
<A>__{wes looks over the box carefully.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people i would have to say it's a box.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{can you eat it? if you can't eat it i really don't care what it is.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{ask him what it is.}
<A>__{wes says something to the vendor in arabic. the vendor answers back.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{he says it's a box.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah, you're funny.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{it's a puzzle box. if you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{for real? a treasure?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{there might be something in there.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{yeah, the deed to the brooklyn bridge.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{there might be.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{and you're the guy who's going to open it.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i could.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you could turn on a light if someone put your hand on the switch.}
<A>__{decisively, without even haggling about price, jaeger whips out some money and pays the vendor for the box.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{well, that showed me. now, can we eat?}
<A>__{the three men walk on, jaeger starting to work on the puzzle box.}
