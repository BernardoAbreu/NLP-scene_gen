<C>__{monica}
<D>__{you're serious.}
<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{seems like i needed a ball when i was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him. now, i kinda think i need to try something else.}

<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{maybe go back to school.}
<C>__{monica}

<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{so why'd you give up ball?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{why do you keep asking me that?}
<C>__{quincy}

<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{monica is too hurt, too scared to tell him the truth.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{it doesn't matter, alright. just leave it alone.}
<C>__{quincy}
