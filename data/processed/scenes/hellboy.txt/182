<A>__{the ruins of new york, charred, smoldering. human remains litter the landscape. monstrous shapes lumber in the distance... an army of apocalyptic beasts outlined against the blood red sky. dominating the horror is a mountain of festering skeletons and skulls. at the top, a figure: hellboy, transformed. his horns are in full bloom, his eyes and mouth stream unearthly fire.}

<D>__{if only you had him destroyed sixty years ago, none of this would come to pass. but, then, how could you have known?}
<A>__{broom is speechless.}

<D>__{your god chooses to remain silent. mine lives within me.}
<A>__{rasputin stands, the flesh of his neck and shoulders heaving and twitching beneath his human skin.}

<D>__{in the frozen waters of the malaya nevka, in the darkness of the void: every time i died and crossed over, a little more of the master came back with me. he disclosed to me the child's true name... would you like to know it??}
<C>__{broom}
<D>__{i know what to call him. nothing you can say or do will change that. i call him son.}
<A>__{discreetly, broom removes his rosary and places it on the book. kroenen settles in behind him.}
<C>__{broom}
<D>__{i am ready.}
<C>__{grigory}
<D>__{good. now, i will add two crumbs more:}
<P>__{(kroenen displays his knives)}
<D>__{grief and revenge...}
<A>__{kroenen's knife goes in.}
