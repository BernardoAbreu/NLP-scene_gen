<L>__{exterior sherwood forest night}
<A>__{a winter's night. bitterly cold. sad figures huddled around a small fire. fanny tends to john's wounds, their little ones asleep by their feet. john drinks and passes the jug to tuck, who numbly shakes his head. too depressed even to drink. aslan folds his prayer rug and walks over to robin, who sits alone, staring vacantly into the darkness.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{my pride brought us to this.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{no, friend. it was you who gave these men pride.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i gave them nothing but false hope. tomorrow we will disperse. these people can move south and start over. you must go home and win your jasmina.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{and you?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i am no longer your responsibility.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{that is for me to decide.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(raging)}
<D>__{damn you, arab. i want you out of my life. can't you understand that? go home. go back to your own kind.}
<A>__{aslan stares at him, then turns away. not the time for argument. robin fingers his father's medallion... rips it from his neck.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{damn you, too, father. you reared a coward and a fool.}
<A>__{he hurls the medallion... it catches on a low hanging branch.}
