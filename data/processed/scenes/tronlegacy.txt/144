<L>__{interior encom advanced research lab night}
<A>__{rush materializes in the target chair. human flesh, real clothes. same as the moment he left. he bolts up, realizes where he is. looks at his hands. sees jo jo the rat staring at him. meg and dewey hurry over to unstrap rush. meg holds his hands, checks the integrity of his body.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{rush. you made it!}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{like a bad cold, i'm always coming back.}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{he made it! rush! you okay?!}
<A>__{rush looks around. miles ("krod") and a group of oddly familiar co workers. people who look just like i beem, quantz, boole and the code monkeys.}
<C>__{rush}
<P>__{(double takes on meg)}
<D>__{i met a program you wrote. she's just as incredibly beautiful and confusing as you.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i know. mega told me all about what you did in there.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{she gave you my coordinates. that's how you uploaded me?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{yes. your coordinates... and his.}
<A>__{they look across the room. at the control console stands a man with his back to us. he's curiously examining meg's equipment.}
<C>__{the guy}
<D>__{she's done an amazing job here, rush.}
<A>__{he turns. it's flynn. in the flesh. leg healed.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{flynn!}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{i told you to trust the bigger plan.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i'd come to suspect flynn was alive, inside. but i had no way to know for sure.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{you picked the right guy to send in.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{working down here, i became convinced someone tried to murder flynn. but the only person i could confide in was the guy i suspected most.}
<A>__{elevator opens. sinclair charges in, furious. trailed by security men.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{what are you people doing down here!?! get back to work! x net has crashed! we'll all be ruined!}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{speak for yourself, sinclair.}
<A>__{sinclair wheels to see flynn: alive, standing in front of him. trapped by the ugly truth, sinclair turns rage on meg.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{i ordered you to destroy this equipment!}
<A>__{rush gets in sinclair's face.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{hey, jerk, she doesn't do your dirty work. neither do i. not anymore. you lied to me, to all of us. you want to deal with somebody? i'm the guy who crashed x net.}
<A>__{sinclair goes for rush. rush delivers a solid punch. sinclair grabs his bloody nose.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{you're fired, everybody get out.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{no, sinclair. i'm back. and i'm the boss again. you're fired. not only are you fired, you're going to have a lot of explaining to do to the sec, the justice department and the fbi.}
<P>__{(to security men)}
<D>__{hold him until the police get here.}
<C>__{security man 1}
<D>__{yes sir, mr. flynn.}
<A>__{security men haul out sinclair. flynn addresses the group.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{x net is dead. but encom lives. we're going to bring this company back to its place as the leader in finding the next big thing. i will need to be free to do the dreaming. so, effective immediately, i'm appointing two bold, bright, courageous people to head worldwide operations.}
<A>__{he presents rush and meg. they're stunned.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{you both earned it.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i love it.}

<P>__{(to phlegman)}
<D>__{does that mean a bigger cubicle?}
<A>__{cheers all around. flynn approaches rush and meg.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{put on some coffee. you two are going to be putting in a lot of overtime together.}
<A>__{meg turns to rush.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{do you remember how, along time ago, you used to give me a professional congratulatory peck on the cheek?}
<A>__{rush goes for the lips.}
