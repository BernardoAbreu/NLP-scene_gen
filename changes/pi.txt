<LOC>__{INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - MAIN ROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Max's room is constantly dark because the windows are blacked out. He flips on his desk lamp. A tiny ANT crawls across his desk. He looks at it for a moment before getting angry and squashing it. Sitting on the desk are three computer monitors, which Max flips on. Then he pops on more lights and more switches. We pull back revealing that Max's apartment looks more like the inside of a computer than a human's home. The room is knee-high in computer parts of all shapes and sizes. The walls are covered with circuit boards. Cables hang from the ceiling like vines in a Brazilian rain forest. They all seem to be wired together forming a monstrous homemade computer. This is EUCLID, Max's creation. The computer is alive with sounds and lights. Max works on Euclid with his solder and drill. He cares for the machine as if it were his dream car}

To accomplish this, the tree has made a contract with a highly specialized red ant. The tree has evolved giant spores which act as housing for the ants In return for shelter, the ants supply defense. When a giraffe starts to eat the tree's leaves, the shaking branch acts like an alarm. The ants charge out and secrete an acid onto the giraffe's tongue. The giraffe learns its lesson and never returns. Without each other, the tree would be picked dry and the ants would have no shade from the brutal African sun Both would die.
