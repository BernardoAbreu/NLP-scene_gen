<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior desert (day)}
<A>__{from far away, we see gregory and chandra hiding under the only bit of shade available for miles, a tiny outcropping of rock. we sail in and cut to a panning shot, scanning over the harsh ground, onto chandras feet, clad in gregorys boots, up her sun scorched and scratched legs. shes collapsed onto gregory. hes in equally bad shape. gregory leans with his back against the rock, eyes opening and closing as he drifts in and out of sleep.}
<C>__{gregory pov}
<A>__{he stars at the horizon and the mirages of water reflecting the jaundiced yellow sky. in the shimmering distance, a man appears, but gregorys lids shut and we see darkness. when he reopens them, the figure is more clear. its a man, dressed in a black suit. even in the distance we can recognize him. we want it to be him.}
