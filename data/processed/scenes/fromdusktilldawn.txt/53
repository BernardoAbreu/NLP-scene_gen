<D>__{okay, troops, this is the homestretch. here's the deal; this place closes at dawn. carlos is gonna meet us here sometime before dawn. which by my guesstimate is somewhere between three or four hours from now. so we're gonna go in there, take a seat, have a drink have a bunch of drinks, and wait for carlos. that could be an hour, that could be three hours, i don't know which. but when he gets here, me and richie are going to leave with him. after we split, you guys are officially out of this stewpot. let me just say i'm real happy about where we're at. we got a real nice, "i don't fuck with you you don't fuck with me" attitude going on. now, if everybody just keeps playin' it cool and i'm talking to you, too, richie everybody's gonna get what they want. comprende, amigos?}
