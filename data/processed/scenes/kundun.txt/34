<L>__{interior the potala day}
<A>__{lobsang and lhamo skid, slide, skate down the endless, slippery hallways of this huge, labyrinthine monastery. three monks scurry behind the boys, trying to keep up, trying to keep the young incarnate from slipping out of their sight. they shout, in loud stage whispers:}
<C>__{monks}
<D>__{kundun! kundun!}
<A>__{the monks are no match for the little boys, who are quickly out of sight.}
<L>__{interior dalai lama's private rooms the potala day}
<A>__{reting rinpoche sits cross legged on the floor of this brightly painted, red room. across from him sits lhamo, dressed in fine, yellow silk. these are simple rooms, decorated with statues, deity scrolls and mandalas, an altar to buddha. behind a glass case are toys, mixed in with the buddhist artifacts: dolls, puppets, balls, blocks, trains. reting rinpoche is speaking.}
<C>__{reting rinpoche}
<D>__{centuries ago, a young boy was born. his name was gedundrub. the night of his birth, robbers came to his home and his family fled hiding the baby in a cattle pen. when they returned the next day, the baby was safe. they found him guarded by a pair of black crows. he was the first dalai lama. the living buddha of compassion. now, you have chosen to come back to this life once again.}
<A>__{reting blows his nose.}
<C>__{reting rinpoche}
<D>__{we name you tenzin gyatso.}
<A>__{close on lhamo tenzin gyatso.}
<C>__{reting rinpoche}
<D>__{your job is simple. you are to love all living things. just love them. care for them. have compassion for them. "as long as any living thing draws breath, wherever he shall be, there in compassion, shall the buddha appear, incarnate."}
<A>__{at the curtain behind lhamo, we notice the curly toed shoes of a monk, a man who must be standing in the next room.}
