<L>__{exterior hospital roof day}
<A>__{trevor and allison sit in a couple of chairs looking out at the other rooftops around them.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{oh i knew about the chairs already. this is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.}
<A>__{she points to the ground at myriad butts scattered at their feet. trevor smiles and looks at his hands.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{don't tell me. kirsty used to smoke?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{no. she just would have loved it up here... allison when i was under... did i ever talk?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{sure plenty of times.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{was there anything i said that made you stop and wonder, you know, "where did that come from?"}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{sure plenty of times.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. so practically everything say is going to sound strange.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{did i ever talk about the accident?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{did i ever talk about kirsty?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{no. but at one point you did repeat something though. a phrase. you must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what was it?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{you said, "jealousy arouses a husbands fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge." (proverbs 6:34) does that mean anything to you trevor?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{it means i have alot more questions.}
<A>__{trevor stares off into the distance.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{times up for today. i've got to get back.}
<A>__{allison smiles and pats trevor's knee. he melts and puts his hand on hers. she slowly takes it away and fixes her hair.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{if it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control i had. trevor, i never date patients.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i understand... i won't }
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{no you don't understand. that's why i've been fighting to get you better. so you wouldn't be a patient anymore.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me sooner? i would have switched doctors!}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{just get better okay?}
<A>__{she caresses his face then looks at her watch.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{i have to get back to work. and so do you.}
