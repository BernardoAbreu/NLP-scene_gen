<L>__{interior morgue funeral home night}
<A>__{a lone desk lamp shines. across the room, laying on a porcelain table, fluid draining tubes attached, lies tod. a sheet is pulled up to his shoulders. he carries the macabre appearence of a corspe having been made up by a mortician. hair combed and sprayed, skin tone too orange, blush too rouge and lips too red. as alex and clear approach...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{that... him?}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{i think. but why'd they make him up like... michael jackson?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{that's him, but... he's not here. that... whatever... that whatever made him tod is gone.}
<A>__{suddenly, tod jerks; his hand lifting four inches...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{ahhh! fuck! you fucking asshole. you think this is funny, you fucking dick? tod, if you're not dead i'm gonna fucking kill you!}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{ohmygod! ohmygod! ohmygod! he's not dead?}
<C>__{mr. bludworth }
<D>__{please don't yell...}
<A>__{both are jolted again with shock, turning toward the voice...}
<B>__{mr. bludworth}
<A>__{camera pushes, low angle, into willaim bludworth, an african american man, early 50's, dressed in dark suit and tie.}
<C>__{mr. bludworth}
<D>__{you'll wake the dead.}
<A>__{he flashes a dry mortician's smile, pleased by his wan pun. alex and clear haven't recovered from the corspe's actions to calmly address bludworth..}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{why..?}
<A>__{alex completes his question by raising his hand, ala tod's dead body. bludworth nods, understanding...}
<C>__{mr. bludworth}
<D>__{chemicals in the vascular flush create cadaveric spasm.}
<A>__{as the startle of the situation settles, it dawns on alex that they have been busted. he nervously offers an explanation.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm... a friend of his. his best friend. see, his father...}
<C>__{mr. bludworth}
<P>__{(ominous)}
<D>__{i know who you are.}
<A>__{the mortician eyes alex, understanding. alex senses this and eases. clear moves toward tod's body, examining the neck area.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{they said he hung himself, but there's no marks.}
<C>__{mr. bludworth}
<D>__{i crafted a reconstruction of the laryngeal prominence region with velvetone surgical wax and permaseal.}
<A>__{clear moves in for a closer look, then calls alex over to the body. after a beat of reluctance, alex looks at tod's neck.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what are all those tiny marks?}
<A>__{alex's pov close tod's neck the wounds have been filled with wax and covered by greasepainterior at this proximity, however, it is apparent tiny cuts line the area above and below the large cut made by the wire.}
<C>__{mr. bludworth }
<D>__{cuticle lacerations.}
<B>__{wider}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{why would they say it was a suicide... if it weren't?}
<A>__{because of the supernatural "message" he recieved, alex is reluctant to answer. he eyes mr. bludworth, who, with a wry half smile, eyes alex as if aware of the reason behind his hesitation.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{his father's pretty fucked up with denial. maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.}
<C>__{mr. bludworth}
<D>__{in death...}
<A>__{camera inches toward the mortician. in this environment, lit with fritz lang shadows, bludworth's tone, appearance... he could easily be mistaken for personification of the subject.}
<C>__{mr. bludworth}
<D>__{... there are no accidents. no coincidencess. no mishaps.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{and no... escapes.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you saying tod did kill himself?}
<A>__{bludworth moves to tod on the draining table, disconnecting the tubes connecting the body to the embalming chemicals.}
<C>__{mr. bludworth}
<D>__{suicide. murder. plane crash. what does it matter? he was going to end someday. from the minute you're cut loose from the womb... it's a one way ticket on a trip to the tomb.}
<A>__{vile liquid oozes out of the body onto the porcelain table.}
<C>__{mr. bludworth}
<D>__{you may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of death's sadistic design leading to the grave.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{design?}
<A>__{the mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from the table. he shrugs then continues his work...}
<C>__{mr. bludworth}
<D>__{if life is like a box of chocolates... death... death is like a big milton bradley game of "mouse trap." the day you're born is just the boot, hanging from the streetlamp, kicking the marble to get things rolling. growing up is only the marble rolling down the curving chute. you feel immortal having survived school, sex, drugs 'n' rock 'n' roll, but you've really only upset the big hand holding the steel ball that falls into the bathtub. marriage and kids and career seem to make it all worthwhile until the ball hits the see saw and flips the diving man into the big barrel. in the old folks home or the hospital you just see the big cage rattling down until it captures... the mouse.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{game over.}
<A>__{alex considers as clear eyes him, conveying "this guys's whacked!" alex moves toward bludworth...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{maybe there's no way to win... but... if you figured out the game... you knew where the "steel ball was rolling" couldn't you avoid the trap and extend the playing time? couldn't you... cheat death at its own game?}
<A>__{mr. bludworth looks directly at alex. camera moves in on each, individually... this between the two of them.}
<C>__{mr. bludworth}
<D>__{you already did that by walking off the plane. now you gotta out when and how it'll come back at you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{play your hunch, alex. if you think you can get away from it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but beware the risk of cheating the plan, disrespecting the design... could iniciate a horrifying fury that would terrorize even the grim reaper.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and you don't even want to fuck with that mack daddie.}
<A>__{alex's eyes are locked on bludworth's chilling, pleasant smile. the mortician yanks on a tube, revealing a foot long needle removed from tod's spinal column. the horrific nature of death is vividly demonstrated to alex.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm sorry we broke in.}
<C>__{mr. bludworth}
<D>__{no harm. no foul.}
<A>__{alex grabs her arm, starting toward the door.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{we didn't find what we were looking for.}
<A>__{alex looks at bludworth...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yeah, we did.}
<B>__{mr. bludworth}
<A>__{camera pushes into the mortician, pleased the message has been recieved.}
<C>__{mr. bludworth}
<D>__{i will see you soon.}
