<A>__{ben hangs up. he glances back at the rear view mirror and sees angela's corpse, sitting on the back seat! startled, he loses control of the vehicle. a truck approaches at full speed in the opposite lane. he barely avoids the collision. two other cars appear. ben zigzags in and out, just barely avoiding a fatal crash. he stops along the edge of the road. ben closes his eyes and rests his head against the steering wheel in an attempt to clear his mind. he looks up into the rear view mirror again angela's reflection is still there. behind her long black hair, she fixes him with a milky gaze. ben flies into a rage. he smashes the rear view mirror with his bare fist, reducing it to scraps... ben is alone and lost.}
