<A>__{small, cramped; not like the earlier one we saw. the hairdresser whom we recognize as tora, the woman who cut bebe's hair stands waiting, holding her brushes and looking vexed. frances enters.}
<C>__{tora}
<D>__{it's about time! you're not the star on this show, y'know!}
<A>__{frances sits. tora begins brushing her hair, yanking frances' head back with each stroke. building tension...}
<C>__{tora}
<D>__{of course, it's not up to me to say anything. i'm just crew... y'know, you hair's so fine you'll lose it if you're not careful. wonder you all don't, the things you do to yourselves. in fact, i think you are already... fact, i think you better }
<A>__{frances cries out and twists around suddenly. tora is thrown back: stumbling... falling... hitting her jaw against a chair.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{that's it! i'm not taking this any more! i quit!}
<A>__{she storms out. tora is left moaning, holding her jaw.}
