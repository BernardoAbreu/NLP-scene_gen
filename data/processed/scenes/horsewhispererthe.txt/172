<A>__{she's trying so hard to be brave. after a moment, she reaches for the saddle horn. she puts her prosthetic leg in the stirrup, takes a breath and swings her leg up slipping, falling to the ground. tom doesn't say anything. she pulls herself back up. she repeats the action... determinedly. she swings her leg over again and sits squarely on the horse. tom remains still, but proud. as the day breaks, we leave them in silence tom standing, hands in pocket... grace sitting up on the horse, proudly.}
