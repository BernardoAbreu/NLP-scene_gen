<L>__{interior magic castle repository night}
<A>__{undusted shelves piled high with manuscripts, old books, and posters in every direction.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{whoa...}
<A>__{on the wall, plaster life masks. in glass cases, the tools of the great magicians: knives, keys, guns, wands, even an iron maiden. billy is in awe. he wanders around wide eyed while harry scans the shelves. the dialogue runs as they investigate.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i hear mrs. swann's quite a babe.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you heard right.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you ever been married?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah. she was killed in a car crash. her lawyer was driving. she was filing for divorce.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{my life was too weird for her.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{i love weird.}
<A>__{harry has seen a small sigil carved onto one of the shelves.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{billy? this was on miller's forehead. any idea what it is?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{nope.}
<A>__{harry presses it. the entire bookcase opens up, creaking.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{what did i tell you? so fucking hokey.}
<A>__{inside, there is a small shelf. on it, files and papers.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what have we got here?}
<A>__{ever eager, billy steps into the recess. and two spiked, latticed gates close on his arm! harry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from skewering billy's flesh and bone! he keeps them open, his sinews straining.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{grab the files!}
<A>__{billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files. as he steps out of range. harry lets go and the gates close with a clang!}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{jesus!}
<A>__{he slams the files down. he's trembling.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i could have lost my fucking hands.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that would have kept you out of the magic circle.}
<P>__{(he studies the files)}
<D>__{which was presumably the idea.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{these are about nix.}
<A>__{harry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to billy.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you go through these. go on!}
<A>__{reluctantly, billy does so. harry picks up a faded photograph of the doorway to nix's house (with the sigil painted on it) and butterfield the child standing in the sun. there are other cultists standing around. and in the doorway a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for that) is nix.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{wait a minute...}
<A>__{he stares at the boy's face. the eyes are clearly different colours.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's butterfield...}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(points to nan in) doorway)}
<D>__{and who's that?}
<A>__{on harry, staring at the ambiguous presence. on the photograph of the shadowy figure.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{at a guess? the puritan. nix.}
<A>__{billy picks up an etching, water stained and dirty. it shows a horror we recognize: a man's hand pressed into the flesh of another man's head.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{take a look at this.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(looking at it)}
<D>__{a nix specialty?}
<A>__{billy is getting subtly spooked now. he puts the etching down and starts to go through others in the series. we glimpse them as he does so. in one, a man regurgitates a serpentine form made of flame. in another, a man stares at his own hand which is stripped of flesh. there is no bone beneath. only a form of solid blackness. in a third, we see a head with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating}
<B>__{darkness.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i don't know any of these tricks...}
<A>__{harry studies the etchings.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(a slow burn)}
<D>__{maybe they're not tricks.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(mystified)}
<D>__{i mean, there's no instructions }
<P>__{(realizes what harry said)}
<D>__{what do you mean, they're not tricks?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what did vinovich say? something about walking a path between }
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{trickery and divinity. yeah, he says that all the time.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's because he knew. he'd seen these files and knew.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{knew what?}
<A>__{out of the corner of his eye. harry sees a motion between the book stacks. billy frowns. harry puts his fingers to his lips. gestures for billy to take cover. billy backs away. harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion. something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks. a figure in a straight jacket with his head bowed. harry takes out his gun. billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks. harry goes after the apparition. the track is completely silent. suddenly, the creature appears behind billy! it looks up, its face that of a psychotic: burning eyes, manic smile. it tears open its straight jacket and reaches for billy, who backs away.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{harry!}
<A>__{books tumble on top of billy as he stumbles against the shelves.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{where the fuck are you?}
<A>__{harry appears, and puts his gun to the psycho's head.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{okay. hold it right there.}
<A>__{the gun goes through the psycho's skull, as though it's made of smoke. harry waves his hands through it. it's completely ethereal. but it's still terrorizing billy.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(in mortal terror)}
<D>__{get it off me!}
<A>__{harry glances around. sees a light flickering between some books. fires at it. the light goes out. the "psycho" vanishes. billy is left hyper ventilating on the ground.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hokey enough for you?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i'm out of here, man! are you coming?}
<A>__{harry picks up a handful of papers from the nix file.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm coming.}
<A>__{billy is already out of the room. for a moment. harry pauses to look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked gates. as he does so the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the "psycho" appears roaring at harry's shoulder.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ah, shaddup!}
<A>__{he fires at the projector a second time. on the gun shot }
