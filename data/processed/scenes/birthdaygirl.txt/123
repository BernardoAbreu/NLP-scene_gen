<L>__{exterior car park roof day}
<A>__{running flat out across the car park. yuri throws open the car door and john hurls the guitar cases inside. he dives in, turns the key in the ignition. the rover coughs and wheezes. he tries again. it spits and misfires. the third time it catches and lives. john grinds the gears and lurches off.}
