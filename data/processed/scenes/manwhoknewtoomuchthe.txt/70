<A>__{they are passing a couple who are seated on cushions eating. the couple look up at ben and jo. they are the same two people we saw come out of the hotel mamounia just as the mckennas entered. the woman had stared at jo, and she does it again, nudging the man next to her with an elbow. the mckennas almost pass them, then stop. the woman continues half looking over her shoulder again, then turns back to her dinner.}
