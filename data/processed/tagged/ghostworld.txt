<D>__{high school is like the training wheels for the bicycle of real life. it is a time for young people to explore different fields of interest and to hopefully grow from their experiences. after all, that which we learn from our mistakes can be as valuable as what we learn from our textbooks, and often we can turn the negative experiences that are common to all high schoolers into positive steps toward personal growth and achievement. in coming to terms with my own personal setback, which i'm sure you've all heard about, i've been able to learn a lot about myself. i've learned for one thing that i don't need to rely on drugs and alcohol}

<A>__{enid dejectedly enters and heads straight for the bathroom. she rummages through a cabinet until she finds the right box (black hair dye). she wets her hair, then goes into the bedroom and mechanically turns on her boom box. the punk rock song we heard earlier plays. she yanks out the tape and flings it away. she skims through her records and cds, dismissing them all. she notices seymour's bag in the corner. she takes out the record and puts it on. the first tune is an upbeat instrumental number. she returns to the bathroom. several minutes pass. track two begins on the lp. she (and we) slowly begin to take notice. it's a strange, haunting old blues record. we see that the tune has struck a nerve.}

<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i think that phillip and enid can help us to see that there are many different ways we can express ourselves. we can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. i hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.}

<D>__{i need to talk to you.}
<L>__{interior the coffee experience day}
<A>__{enid & rebecca sit at a table. rebecca is wearing her uniform.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i'm sorry about the other day. i don't know what's wrong with me... i really do want to move in with you.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i don't know... i was thinking maybe i should live alone. i decided to rent that place we looked at. i'm moving in next week.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{please let me come with you. please please please...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i don't know i'm not sure it's a good idea.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{but how are you gonna pay rent and everything? you don't even have a job.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i will get a job tomorrow, i promise. if i don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.}
<L>__{interior enid's room late morning}
<A>__{enid is putting on her shoes. her dad opens the door slightly and sticks his head in.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{pumpkin, are you in there?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{are you going to yell at me?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{yeah, i heard about that.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i was in a horrible mood tell her not to worry, i will be completely out of her life in a few days.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{she understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. she says that job at computer station is still available if you want it.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i i'm not sure... yeah, maybe.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{actually, i was just checking to see if you were here your friend seymour is on his way up.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what do you mean "on his way up"!?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i just buzzed him in.}
<A>__{just then, three sharp knocks on the front door.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what's wrong with you?! tell him i'm not here!}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{but i can't }
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{just do it!}
<A>__{dad goes to answer the door. enid hides in her room.}
<C>__{dad }
<D>__{i'm not sure when she'll be back...}
<A>__{enid looks out the window and sees seymour walking away. she has a terribly sad look on her face.}
<L>__{interior seymour's bedroom evening}
<A>__{seymour sits in dim light, dialing an antique "candlestick" telephone. in the background, a peter, paul and mary concert plays on the tv. we hear three rings followed by enid's answering machine message. he hangs up before it finishes. joe walks by the doorway.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, here's where the fun never stops!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{yeah, i'm really, really happy. really having a good time.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{still torturing yourself over that enid, huh?}
<A>__{seymour doesn't answer. he looks away.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{where else am i ever going to find another girl who likes geeshie wiley records?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{she could at least have the decency to call me back.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. who knows? it could be a million things. it's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.}
<A>__{again no answer from seymour, he stares off into space.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{maybe she's got another boyfriend.}
<C>__{seymour}
<P>__{(bummed out, wants joe to stop)}
<D>__{yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{seymour looks so miserable that even joe has some compassion for him.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{look at it this way at least things can't get any worse.}
<A>__{joe leaves. seymour is left listening to the record.}
<L>__{interior cook's chicken headquarters day.}
<A>__{seymour is at work, walking down a carpeted hallway with many doors on both sides. a door opens and a tony robbins ish, 35 year old management executive sticks his head out.}
<C>__{executive}
<D>__{seymour! just the man i want to see. step in here for a minute.}
<A>__{seymour enters.}
<C>__{executive}
<D>__{have a seat.}
<A>__{he plunks down the current issue of the free weekly it's open to a 1 2 page article on page 8 with the headline "oh brother!" and a photo of the painting being removed.}
<C>__{executive}
<D>__{what can you tell me about this, seymour?}
<L>__{interior enid & rebecca's new apt.}
<A>__{enid is wearing a bright orange "computer station" t shirt and a yellow vest with a "trainee" tag. she's looking around at her new home: a hopelessly drab, characterless apartment.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{so, whaddya think?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{it's fine.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{so where's all your stuff?}
<A>__{enid points to a small box with sketchbook, etc.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{there.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{that's all you're bringing?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i'm gonna finish packing tonight... i will bring it over tomorrow sometime.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{what time?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i dunno...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{make sure you're here by noon we have tons of stuff to do... oh yeah! i have to show you something else!}
<A>__{she drags enid into the kitchen and opens a built in ironing board as though it's the most amazing thing she's ever seen.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{isn't this the greatest?}
<L>__{interior enid's room late evening}
<A>__{enid is sorting her stuff into boxes. digging through her closet, she finds a box that she doesn't recognize. inside are her old children's records (45's). she excitedly takes one out and plays it. she folds her clothes while listening to this song, which clearly is getting to her. she grabs mechanically for the next thing hanging in her closet. it's the uniform from her job at "computer station." she folds it, puts it in the box, then stops, staring at the orange fabric.}
<L>__{interior enid and rebecca's apt. the next day}
<A>__{rebecca is nervously arranging and re arranging her stuff. she puts up her gigantic new kitchen wall clock and sets the time to 12:45. she goes to the phone and calls enid. the machine picks up and rebecca hangs up. she does another tedious, pointless task. it's now 3:30. she's pissed off and goes to the phone to call again. as it rings there's a knock on the door. relieved, she hangs up and goes to answer.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(as she opens the door)}
<D>__{what's wrong with you, retard it's three thirty!}
<A>__{it's seymour standing there, not enid.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{uh... hi. uh... enid's stepmother told me i'd find her here?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{she's not at home?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{no... they said she was here...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{what the fuck is she doing?! she was supposed to be here three hours ago!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{uh, do you mind if i wait? i really need to talk to her.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(allows him to step}
<D>__{inside but leaves}
<P>__{the door open)}
<D>__{are you sure she wasn't there? maybe she was just hiding from you.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{why would she be hiding from me?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i don't know... where is she, then?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{maybe she's with josh?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{josh!? why would she be with josh?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{why? what did she tell you?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{she just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating i thought maybe she was...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{what? is she having some secret affair with josh?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i have no idea i just want to...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{why wouldn't she tell me? there's no way! she could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.}

<D>__{really, i don't know enough about it to...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{that slut!}
<C>__{seymour}
<P>__{(changing subject back to me)}
<D>__{why did you say she might be hiding from me? did she say anything to you about me?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(getting revenge on seymour)}
<D>__{yeah, she thinks you're a dork.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{did she say that?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{look, what do you expect? considering how we met you.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{on that pathetic fake blind date.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{didn't she ever tell you about that? god, she really is pathological...}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{what fake blind date? what are you talking about?}
<A>__{rebecca goes over and gets enid's sketchbook out of the box and flips through it. when she gets to the right page she hands it to seymour.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{here. read it and weep.}
<A>__{we see a pasted up personal ad beside a drawing of seymour in wowsville. on the facing page we see a drawing of josh with his name surrounded by red hearts.}
<L>__{exterior sidewinder afternoon}
<A>__{seymour's car screeches into the parking lot. he bursts into the store, ready for once in his life to make a scene.}
<L>__{interior sidewinder afternoon}
<A>__{josh is behind the counter cleaning the slurpee machine, with his back to the entrance, as seymour storms in. doug is over by the magazine rack reading a dirt bike magazine.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i hope you had a good laugh at my expense.}
<A>__{josh turns around what's going on? he recognizes seymour.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{huh... oh... hi... uh...}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{you want to see something funny? i will show you something funny!}
<A>__{as he says this he flips over a small display rack of potato chips. then he tries to flip over a big display case in front of the counter but is unable to budge it he keeps trying and gets more and more frustrated.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{josh runs from behind the counter to stop him before he creates a huge mess. he tries to grab seymour and they get into a ridiculous frantic scuffle. seymour starts yelling. suddenly doug appears and gets seymour in a choke hold with his nunchucks. doug ad libs cop style jargon. josh is freaked out. seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry. the boss comes out of the back room...}
<C>__{boss}
<D>__{josh! what going on here?!}
<L>__{interior enid & rebecca's apartment around midnight}
<A>__{the apartment is dark lit only by a harsh, annoying streetlight. rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes, exasperated. she goes to look out the window. cars with loud radios can be heard driving by. she goes to the phone she checks it and hangs up. pause. she picks it up again one last try. she dials the number and waits. we hear the beep of the answering machine. rebecca hangs up. she gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a cold linoleum floor). she zips the zipper all the way over her head and curls up into a whimpering ball.}
<T>__{fade to black:}
<A>__{title card: "several months later"}
<L>__{interior therapist's office day}
<A>__{the dialogue begins in voice over as the title card fades. we slowly fade in to see seymour, lying on a pink pastel psychiatrist's couch, as he speaks to his therapist, a handsome, well coiffed woman in her late 40s.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{so tell me more about this job. what exactly will you be doing?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their cd reissues. it's really... i can't believe it.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{remember what i said when we first started this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{it doesn't pay very much, but i should be able to afford my own place in a few months... do you think that's too soon? i'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{why don't we start with that next week?}
<A>__{seymour looks up. she nods toward the large wall clock behind her: thirty seconds after five. re gets up and she walks him slowly toward the door.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{thank you, doctor.}
<C>__{therapist}
<P>__{(as she opens the door)}
<D>__{don't thank me. you're doing all the work.}
<A>__{a pause. they stand facing each other.}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{seymour?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{therapist}
<D>__{do you have a check for me?}
<A>__{seymour takes a filled out check from his shirt pocket. in the waiting room, we see seymour's mother.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{seymour? are you done? did you have a chance to think about what you might want for dinner while you were in there?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{we can talk about it in the car, ma...}
<A>__{as they leave seymour looks back and smiles weakly at the doctor.}
<L>__{interior quality cafe late afternoon}
<A>__{the cafe has been fully remodeled and now resembles wowsville more than the old quality cafe. there are no neighborhood "characters" anymore, only well heeled twenty somethings. we see that rebecca is now a waitress here. she tears off a check and places it in front of a super muscular, polo shirted european hipster, who is too busy tapping away at his powerbook to notice. she walks toward the end of the counter to total up her receipts. she looks up and sees enid, wearing tasteful 1930's style clothes, sitting across from her.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{oh, hi... i almost didn't recognize you i think i need to get glasses; you're all blurry!}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(nodding toward muscular hipster)}
<D>__{you're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{actually, he's a really nice guy.}
<A>__{we see at this point that rebecca & enid are no longer friends, but there are also no hard feelings evident.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{do you want anything?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{maybe an orange juice.}
<A>__{rebecca goes to get it. enid looks around, bemused and saddened by what the quality cafe has become.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{hey, look what i got...}
<A>__{she takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls out her diploma.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{wow... finally.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{it just came yesterday...}

<D>__{hey josh.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{are you ready to go?}

<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(still counting receipts)}
<D>__{yeah, just one second...}
<A>__{she finishes, takes off her apron and emerges from behind the counter. she kisses josh perfunctorily.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(to josh)}
<D>__{did you remember to pay the phone bill?}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(to enid)}
<D>__{call me sometime.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{definitely. we still have to go to that shoe store sometime.}
<A>__{rebecca & josh leave. enid is totally alone in the now alien world of the quality cafe. a momentary pause as she calmly stares into her orange juice. we see a small, round travel bag at her feet.}
<L>__{exterior city streets acme shoes evening}
<A>__{we see enid walking down the familiar streets of her world. it's early evening, quiet except for distant street noises. she walks toward the old acme shoes and repair store. it looks the same, miraculously preserved, until she stands right in front of it. she looks through the partially papered over window and sees workmen inside installing new fixtures: a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a familiar green plastic. a sign in the window reads: "coming soon: another coffee experience.}
<L>__{exterior city street evening}
<A>__{she continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm stillness to the city. she turns a corner and is startled by her reflection in a large window made of one way glass. she stops and looks at herself. everything about her looks perfect for once; no need to change a thing. she moves closer to the glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside. she continues walking. darkness is just setting in and she has the street all to herself.}
<L>__{exterior commercial area bus stop night}
<A>__{we see enid at norman's bus stop, sitting on the bench. she looks at the apartment building across the street. a woman who has just arrived home from work turns on the tv, bathing her living room with that eerie blue light. the same thing happens in another window down the street... then another... enid looks down the street. in the distance a bus rounds the corner and heads toward her. from a third story window across the street, we see the bus as it arrives and stops, blocking enid from view. a moment later it pulls away, leaving an empty bench. the camera moves upward, farther and farther away as the music swells and the credits roll.}

<A>__{the bus disappears over the crest of the bridge.}
