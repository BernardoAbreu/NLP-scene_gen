<L>__{interior sorsha's tent night}
<A>__{the lieutenant clamps irons on willow's wrists, flings him into a tent and exits. willow looks up and sees sorsha, still in her uniform, impatiently pacing wiht the crying baby.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{this baby won't do what i say. you seem to know what to do. here! make it shut up.}
<A>__{sorsha dumps the baby in willow's arms and then backs away.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{she needs to be changed.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{i changed her already!}
<A>__{willow politely shrugs.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{she needs to be changed again.}
<A>__{sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as willow changes the baby. soon the baby stops crying. re lieved yet still anxious, sorsha paces to a mirror. willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire. then his eyes focus on the fire.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{who is that horrible friend of yours?}
<C>__{willow}
<P>__{(watching the fire)}
<D>__{madmartigan.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{who is he?}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i don't know much about him.}
<A>__{sorsha fiddles with her long red hair. willow creeps toward the fire.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{he's very bold. do you really think my hair is beautiful?}
<A>__{she turns and looks right at willow. he looks back. she asks the question again by holding out strands of her hair.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{uh, yes. it's very nice hair.}
<A>__{he suddenly strides over to sorsha.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{she's hungry.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{i know she's hungry. i tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing. i'm not a wet nurse.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{here. hold her.}
<A>__{he hands sorsha the baby, then goes to the fire where there's a stone crock of milk. he carefully takes his cloth pouch out of his pocket and unfolds it. at the other side of the tent sorsha awkwardly paces with the baby.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{i tried everything. a spoon. i poured milk into her mouth, she just spat it out. i don't know what to do, i'm not a mother.}
<A>__{during this, willow ignites his powdery substance. it flares slightly then burns to an ash. he gathers it up, then returns to sorsha with the milk.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{sometimes she likes it heated.}
<A>__{willow finds a strip of cloth, dips it in the milk, and feeds elora danan in sorsha's arms. he looks up at sorsha and smiles.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{she's a good baby.}
<A>__{sorsha looks down at the baby.}
