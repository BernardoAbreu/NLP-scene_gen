<D>__{its all been coming apart. i can feel it}
<C>__{lord}
<D>__{youre right.}
<A>__{[wictred rides up]}
<C>__{wictred}
<D>__{there is very little time. fortunately, donnchadh has no quarrel with anybody here. hes asked me to give you a message.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{whats this?}
<C>__{wictred}
<D>__{it is compensation for the men you will lose attacking castle dor with donnchadh tomorrow. lets be honest, our people need a stronger leader.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{and who might that be, wictred?}
<C>__{wictred}
<D>__{melot. too long the ablest amoung us has been denied his rightful place. i pledge you my legiance and offer him my services as his second.}
<C>__{melot}
<D>__{i like this plan.}
<A>__{[tristan is in chains in the keep. marke comes down to see him]}
<C>__{marke}
<D>__{i came to apologise. ive been selfish arrogantly thinking that perhaps id given enough. at least enough to merit if not your love then at least your respect. you have a home. a kingdom. why was it not enough? tell me. tell me! you do not know what you have done! everything is destroyed, everything! all because you did not have enough. shes loyal to you i am sure of it. you bloodsucker. what could it had been had i not stretched out my hand to save your life. how i curse that day, how i curse it. and so be with your defence. then i will go complete your punishment, donnchadh marches on us as we speak.}
<A>__{[marke strides away. bragnae catches up to him in a corridor. she bars entrance to his bedroom]}
<C>__{bragnae}
<D>__{shes young. i will not let you harm her!}
<A>__{[marke moves bragnae out of the way and enters the room]}
<C>__{marke}
<D>__{how long?}
<C>__{isolde}
<D>__{since you thought he was dead. i found him wounded on the beach in ireland. i hid him from my father and i told him my name was bragnae. so when he came to the tournament at dunluce to win donnchadhs daughter he didnt realise it was me. all this time my heart has been his, and i am sorry. he tried harder than you can possibly imagine because he loves you.}
<A>__{[marke leaves the room in silence] [merlot and wictred walk through the forest discussing plans]}
<C>__{melot}
<D>__{i will coax him out, make sure donnchadh knows this.}
<C>__{wictred}
<D>__{of course, of course. you know as things moved along i suspected them for some time.}
<C>__{merlot}
<D>__{tristan and isolde?}
<C>__{wictred}
<D>__{you know what i could never work out? how it was conducted. how she got in and out of dor unseen.}
<C>__{merlot}
<D>__{the tunnel.}
<C>__{wictred}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{merlot}
<D>__{the roman tunnel!}
<C>__{wictred}
<D>__{show me.}
<A>__{[a henchman released tristan from the prison and takes him to the riverside where isolde and bragnae are waiting with a boat]}
<C>__{tristan}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{henchman}
<D>__{the will of the king. farwell.}
<C>__{isolde}
<D>__{i told him about ireland. hes given us our freedom. why does loving you feel so wrong?}
<C>__{tristan}
<D>__{get in.}
<C>__{isolde}
<D>__{tristan, if i do this.}
<C>__{tristan}
<D>__{for all time, they will say it was our love that brought down a kingdom. remember us.}
<A>__{[tristan pushes the boat away]}
<C>__{isolde}
<D>__{tristan, dont! tristan! tristan! tristan! why?! tristan!}
<A>__{[tristan runs back to dor] [at dor they bring everyone into the castle and close the gates. the armies close in on dor]}
<C>__{marke}
<D>__{get the livestock and fuel undercover. put some archers on the ramparts.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{all the archers have deserted us as has half the household.}
<C>__{marke}
<D>__{and you stay?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{if you are surprised then they have won already.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{come on, hurry!}
<A>__{[the armies gather outside the keep]}
<C>__{king donnchadh}
<D>__{burn it. their will is as strong as milk. the seas will unravel us. where is wictred with his key?}
<A>__{[at the tunnel entrance]}
<C>__{melot}
<D>__{it comes up to the roman foundations at the lowest level.}
<C>__{wictred}
<D>__{this is a godsend!}
<A>__{[they both enter it and wictred gestures for his men to follow] [there is much fighting as the forces of the irish and traitorous barons besiege castle dor. in the tunnel, wictred and melot move towards the keep]}
<C>__{wictred}
<D>__{what will you say to him?}
<C>__{melot}
<D>__{that he will not make any more mistakes and that it is time for him to move ba whats that?!}
<A>__{[the two turn to see wictreds men following them down the tunnel. melot fights to stop them going down the tunnel but is stabbed] [the enemy forces break through the outer gates and are attempting to get into the keep]}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{aim for the front of the line}
<C>__{marke}
<D>__{they are waiting.}
<A>__{[as wictred and his men enter the keep from the tunnel below, tristan enters the tunnel from the forest entrance]}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{the irish are inside!}
<C>__{marke}
<D>__{follow me!}
<C>__{wictred}
<D>__{bar the door make sure no one gets in!}
<A>__{[in the tunnel, tristan comes upon a wounded melot]}
<C>__{melot}
<D>__{you.}
<C>__{tristan}
<D>__{what happened here?}
<C>__{melot}
<D>__{a reward for idiocy. a dozen irish have blazed your way.}
<C>__{tristan}
<D>__{melot, i came to aid marke.}
<C>__{melot}
<D>__{everyone lies.}
<C>__{tristan}
<D>__{i didnt lead them here.}
<C>__{melot}
<D>__{no, i did.}
<C>__{tristan}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{melot}
<D>__{i thought someone believed in me.}
<C>__{tristan}
<D>__{it will be undone.}
<C>__{melot}
<D>__{tristanim for the wormsswear to me that you are true.}
<C>__{tristan}
<D>__{as we were brothers.}
<C>__{melot}
<D>__{build my boat.}
<A>__{[melot dies] [tristan makes his way to the keep while marke and his men do battle with wictreds]}
<C>__{wictreds man}
<D>__{theyre here!}
<C>__{wictred}
<D>__{keep them back.}

<D>__{give me your shield, were pinned down!}
<A>__{[tristan attacks wictred and his men]}
<C>__{marke}
<D>__{tristan!}
<C>__{markes man}
<D>__{him too?}
<C>__{marke}
<D>__{no, hes with us!}
<A>__{[marke and his men jump into battle, but not before tristan is stabbed. tristan manages to stop the drawbridge falling with his sword. he is again stabbed by wictred]}
<C>__{marke}
<D>__{tristan!}
<A>__{[tristan stabs wictred and kills him. tristan pulls the sword from his body as the battle subsides]}
<C>__{marke}
<D>__{tristan! how did you get here?}
<C>__{tristan}
<D>__{secret. secrets, in the bowls of the keep.}
<C>__{marke}
<D>__{in the bowls of the keep.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{they have reached the palisades.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{then we must keep hope.}
<A>__{[tristan cuts the head off wictreds body and slowly stands. marke nods] [as the drawbridge of the keep is lowered, king donnchadh makes his way to the front]}
<C>__{king donnchadh}
<D>__{get back! ha ha ha! ha ha ha!}
<A>__{[tristan slowly steps out with the head of wictred in his hands]}
<C>__{tristan}
<D>__{behold! the head of a traitor!}
<A>__{[marke and his generals step out]}
<C>__{marke}
<D>__{will you always be little men, who cannot see what was and could be again? there is no middle ground! so slay us or slay him!}
<C>__{king donnchadh}
<D>__{oblidge them. oblidge them!}
<A>__{[he attacks people around him, but is shot in the back by an arrow. suddenly the irish and the british start to fight. tristan falls to the ground and marke runs to his side]}
<C>__{tristan}
<D>__{take me out of here. take me to the river.}
<A>__{[isolde comes to the battle and is grabbed by general who drags her to the riverside]}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{hurry!}
<C>__{marke}
<D>__{bring her.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{marke, you must come, the battle needs you. well lose everything.}
<C>__{marke}
<D>__{i must heed their call, i am the king.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{weve driven them back as far as we can but they are holding us at the throat.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{goodbye my friend.}
<A>__{[marke and his generals leave and isolde goes to tristans side]}
<C>__{isolde}
<D>__{know that i love you tristan. and wherever you go, whatever you see, i will always be with you.}
<C>__{tristan}
<D>__{you were right. i do not know if life is greater than death, but love was more than either.}
<A>__{[tristan dies and isolde weeps. we see tristan and isolde back in the hut in ireland as she reads to him]}
<C>__{isolde}
<D>__{"my face in thine eyes, thine in mine appears,}
<A>__{and true plain hearts do in the faces rest; where can we find two better hemispheres, without sharp north, without declining west? whatever dies, was not mixed equally; if our two loves be one, or thou and i. love so alike, that none can slacken, none can die." [they kiss] their love did not bring down a kingdom. legend says that marke defeated the irish, rebuilt castle dor and reigned in peace until the end of his days. isolde laid tristan beneath the ashes of the roman ruin, planted his grave with two willows that grew forever intertwined... then disappeared.}
