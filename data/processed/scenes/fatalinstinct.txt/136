<A>__{a reporter opens the door marked press room. inside, a dozen reporters press their pants on a dozen ironing boards.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{the jury's back!}
<A>__{the reporters scramble for the door, pulling their pants on!}
<L>__{interior courtroom later}
<A>__{the camera follows a folded piece of paper as the jurors pass it along to the foreman... who hands it to the bailiff... who hands it to the judge. he unfolds it, reads it... then winks flirtatiously at the female juror who wrote it. she blushes.}
<C>__{judge skanky}
<P>__{(back to business)}
<D>__{so... has the jury reached a verdict?}
<C>__{jury foreman}
<P>__{(stands up)}
<D>__{yes we have, your honor.}
<C>__{judge skanky}
<D>__{how do you find the defendant... on the count of manslaughter?}
<C>__{jury foreman}
<D>__{not guilty.}
<C>__{judge skanky}
<D>__{on the count of murder in the first degree?}
<C>__{jury foreman}
<D>__{not guilty.}
<C>__{judge skanky}
<D>__{on the count of monte cristo?}
<C>__{jury foreman}
<D>__{not guilty.}
<A>__{a boisterous clamor in the court. the electronic signs flash "not guilty!"... "not guilty!"... "not guilty!"}
<C>__{judge skanky}
<D>__{good. then on the count of three, let's all get the hell out of here! one... two...}
<A>__{the jury and spectators start to rise. the judge hesitates, gavel poised, shooting them a warning look.}
<C>__{judge skanky}
<D>__{wait... for... it...}
<A>__{everyone freezes halfway out of their seats... waiting.}
<C>__{judge skanky}
<D>__{two and a half... three!}
<A>__{he smacks his gavel. everyone scatters for the doors, but judge skanky beats them out of the room. lana turns cool, dropping her courtroom facade. she plucks off her earrings, unbuttons the neck of her dress, reaches in and magically pulls out her bra, tossing it away.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{well, counselor, looks like you won another case. lucky for me.}
<A>__{two legal aides sneak up behind ned and dump a big plastic barrel of gatorade cans over his head!}
<C>__{bailiff }
<P>__{(over p. a. system)}
<D>__{attention courtroom shoppers! all trial evidence now on sale. forty to sixty percent off all exhibits! everything must go!}
<A>__{they turn to see: spectators and jurors browse through the clutter of junk in front of the court clerk on the evidence table. an irritable woman claims the irritable man, grabbing the cigar from his ear and throwing it down.}
<C>__{irritable woman}
<D>__{i told you, bernard... smoking cigars is bad for your hearing!}
<A>__{she pulls him away as lana steps up, with a cigarette dangling from her lips. lana picks up her gun and spins the cylinder. it's loaded. the battered court clerk limps over, smiling.}
<C>__{court clerk}
<D>__{mrs. ravine! what can i do for ya?}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{how much for my gun?}
<A>__{laura sees this... turns to ned with a look of shock.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i don't believe it! she just bought her gun back! the gun she used to kill a man!}
<A>__{ned looks off toward lana with admiration.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{yeah... the same gun that saved my life. i'm sure it has sentimental value.}
<A>__{as lana wades into the crowd of reporters, some still without pants, the camera moves to lola, who is watching lana from the back of the courtroom. lola pulls a small cord hanging from the side of her hat... opening her veil like window drapes. she's not happy.}
