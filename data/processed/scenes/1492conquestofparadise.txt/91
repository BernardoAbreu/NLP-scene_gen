<L>__{exterior columbus' cabin night}
<A>__{close on: a golden mask... the lamp in the cabin swings violently back and forth, creating strange shadows, as if the mask was alive... columbus is writing with difficulty in his log book.}
<C>__{columbus }
<D>__{... several men are ill. we did not find signs of civilization. no cities, no temples... nothing that resembles marco polo's descriptions. my ships are not filled with the spices and the gold that spain was hoping for. but this land intoxicates the senses like the strongest of perfumes... and all i can think of, is to return to these untamed lands...}
<A>__{suddenly the cabin seems to lurch over. things fall from the table, smashing on the floor... columbus nearly falls.}
