<A>__{as sean continues along, hands in pockets. he turns a corner and collides with rennie, walking her dog. his eyes instantly brighten, as do hers.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{rennie...}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{hi, sean.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i heard you weren't coming.}
<C>__{rennie}
<P>__{(glances at toby)}
<D>__{we changed our minds.}
<A>__{sean pats her dog. there's an awkward pause...they are obviously in the early stages of a relationship. sean reaches into his coat pocket, bringing back a small necklace sized box.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i got you a present.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{but i didn't get you one...}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{forget it. it's a dumb little thing anyway.}
<A>__{rennie opens it up, exposing a petite silver necklace with a statue of liberty pendant on it. she's touched.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{sean...it's beautiful.}
<A>__{sean takes it from her, snapping it around her neck.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i thought maybe we could hike to the top of the statue when we got there, if you felt like it. it's supposed to be 22 stories tall.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{i'd love to.}
<C>__{mcculloch }
<D>__{your father was looking for you, mr. robertson.}
<A>__{mcculloch appears behind them. the mood has been broken.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i guess i will see you later.}
<A>__{sean leaves. mcculloch steps up to rennie, pointing out to the foggy sea. her respiration increases as she psyches herself up to look.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{there's a storm predicted tonight.}
<A>__{rennie looks at the ocean, forcing herself not to turn away.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{you're making a big mistake, rennie. it's not too late to put you back on land.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{i'm staying.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{if miss van deusen knew how afraid you were of...}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{she didn't push me into coming.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{why are you doing this to yourself?}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{i don't even know why i'm afraid, uncle charles. i can't even remember when it started. don't you think it's time i found out and got over it?}
<A>__{he takes a measured pause.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{i'm staying.}
<A>__{he's not going to change her mind. p.o.v. rennie and mcculloch (b & w viewfinder matte) through a porthole window...and through the viewfinder of a video camcorder. mcculloch shakes his head, turning away from rennie and walking away. a sinister electric guitar solo screeches out. pan with mcculloch as he passes the window, coming around 180 degrees into a close up of j.j. jarrett, fingering a sleek gibson "flying v."}

<D>__{is this axe awesome or what?}
