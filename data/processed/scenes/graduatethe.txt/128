<A>__{elaine doesn't answer.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{could you do it?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{the stripper sees elaine look. the stripper smiles toward ben and walks toward his table, twirling the tassels as she walks. ben smiles as he watches her approaching. the stripper moves directly behind elaine's chair. the spotlight from the back of the house falls into elaine's face. as it does, elaine puts her hand up to shield her eyes. the stripper slides a finger into her mouth, wets it and holds it up in the air. the music stops and a drum roll starts. the stripper bends over elaine's head and begins swinging the tassels so that they rotate in front of elaine's face.}
