<A>__{ronnie stands in front of the mall with nell beside him. ronnie looks nervous, but nell looks down at her yellow ring with pride. she looks at ronnie, sees a loose eyelash and brushes it off of him.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{you had an eyelash?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm trying to remember my speech.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{nell looks straight ahead, but smiles as ronnie tries to take himself serious.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<D>__{okay, ronnie, we're ready for you.}
<A>__{ronnie takes a deep breath and walks over to where the local news has set up a camera and microphone.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<D>__{okay, we rolling?}
<C>__{cameraman}
<D>__{rolling.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<D>__{good evening. we're here today with ronnie barnhardt, head of mall security here at carolina mall. last week, ronnie was able to catch the carolina mall flasher single handed and bring him to justice. ronnie, how did you manage to find the identity of the pervert and take him down?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well, being a mall security guard basically requires the same skill set that someone in say the fbi has. you have to use logic and evidence and old fashioned common sense as well as the latest technology to deduce the criminal mind. it's what i do.}
<A>__{all of a sudden, stevie and the skaters come up behind ronnie. they look into the camera lens and start smiling. ronnie turns around and sees them, but tries to focus on the reporter.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<D>__{any last words for the folks at home.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, i'd just like to say that carolina mall is back on track and safer than ever...}
<A>__{the skaters start flipping off the camera. ronnie keeps getting distracted.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{in fact, there are some wonderful sales taking place right now.}
<A>__{stevie walks up behind ronnie and pretends to hump him.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{so for all you families out there, come on down and see us. it's a wonderful place.}
<A>__{ronnie turns around angrily.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that's it, you little shit!}
<A>__{the skaters jump on their skateboards and skate off. ronnie runs after them. he jumps into his golf cart and gives chase. the news camera is still rolling. the female reporter looks into the lens.}
<C>__{female reporter}
<D>__{you heard it, folks. everything is back to normal here at carolina mall. back to you, lindsay.}
