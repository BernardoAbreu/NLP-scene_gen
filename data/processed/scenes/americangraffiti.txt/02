<D>__{..."consider ourselves adults"...}
<A>__{laurie pretends to be interested in her french fries, but is obviously expecting something big.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{right... right... anyway, i thought maybe, before i leave, we could ah... agree that... that seeing other people while i'm away can't possibly hurt, you know?}
<A>__{laurie hasn't looked up but her mood has changed like a mask.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{you mean dating other people?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i think it would strengthen our relationship. then we'd know for sure that we're really in love. not that there's any doubt.}
<A>__{steve smiles and then looks to her. he stops smiling. they listen to the radio for an awkward moment. laurie struggles to hold back her tears. with obvious difficulty, she turns to him and smiles. he's expected something different and doesn't know what to do, so he smiles back.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{i think you're right. i mean, we're not kids anymore, and it's silly to think that when we're three thousand miles apart we shouldn't be able to see other people and go out.}

<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you don't want to wear it?}

<D>__{i didn't say that. i understand and i'm not upset. i mean, i can't expect you to be a monk or something while you're away.}

<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{nothing.}

<C>__{terry}
<D>__{budda, how would you like to go to the drive in movies with me?}

<A>__{the guys tumble out the lavatory door and abruptly cool it as a dumb looking paunchy teacher stops and looks them over, rocking on his heels. they escape quietly. steve and eddie meet laurie coming out of the girls' lavatory with peg. they're watching the dancers as hervie and his band moan through a slow number "she's so fine."}

<D>__{laurie, i thought since this was our last night together for 3 months, you might want to dance with me.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{how sentimental. you'll be back at christmas.}
<C>__{steve}

<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{get your cooties off me }

<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{go ahead, slug me, scar my face. i wouldn't dance with you if you were the last guy left in this gym.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{uh, peg, i think we should dance.}

<D>__{no, this is getting good.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{i will dance with you, eddie. you don't mind, do you, peggy?}
<A>__{she takes eddie by the hand and leaves steve fuming with peg.}
<C>__{peg}
<D>__{joe college strikes out.}
<A>__{steve gives her a snide look, then watches laurie and eddie laughing, as they join in the stroll. the whole gym is strolling in unison, like some strange musical military formation.}
<B>__{high school hallway}
<A>__{the stroll music floats from the gym down the empty hall. curt walks along with his hands in his pockets. one last trip down the grey, locker lined corridor. he slows and stops by locker 2127. he smiles a little, then flips the dial of the lock. once to the right back to the left then to the right again. curt hits the handle. it doesn't open. changed already. he shrugs and goes off down the hallway.}
<B>__{high school gym}

<D>__{no, really, i'd like to, but i can't. i mean, if old mr. simpson came in here and saw me dancing with one of you sexy little excuse me... one of you young ladies, he'd have my rear end.}

<D>__{aahhh.}

<B>__{outside the gym}
<A>__{curt and mr. wolfe come out of the gym. mr. wolfe sees a couple of guys skulking around in the shadows smoking cigarettes and laughing. the music has changed to "see you in september."}

<D>__{hey, warren. come on, gentlemen, back inside. put 'em out. let's go.}
<C>__{curt}

<D>__{no, not yet.}

<D>__{why?}

<P>__{(shrugging)}

<P>__{(she smiles at curt.)}
<D>__{hi, curt.}

<A>__{curt shakes his hand.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{yeah... i will see you. thanks a lot.}
<A>__{curt walks back toward the gym. looking around, he sees mr. wolfe standing in the shadows with the girl, talking intimately. curt turns away and goes off. before going back into the gym, curt stops. he sees a white t bird parked among a row of cars in the parking lot. he walks then starts running toward the car. there's a blonde sitting in the front seat making out with some guy. curt leans down to the window and is about to say something to his dream girl. but she turns and he sees it's not her. her boyfriend glares at him like he's some kind of peeping tom. curt backs away awkwardly, trying to smile. he leaves. cruising main street '32 deuce coupe the yellow ford coupe is gliding down the street skimming around corners gracefully as the night lights glide up its lacquered hood. inside the car, carol glances at john and smiles. the wolfman is howling on the radio.}
<C>__{wolfman }

<D>__{i don't like that surfing shit. rock 'n roll's been going downhill ever since buddy holly died.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{no, i wa at the movies like i said sir.}

<C>__{holstein}
<D>__{uh huh. milner, the reason i stopped you was because the light on your license plate is out.}
<P>__{(opening his ticket book)}
<D>__{i'm gonna have to cite you for that. and milner, the front end of this... this... this thing you're driving looks a little low.}

<D>__{oh...}
<A>__{she looks amazed as she adds the new ticket to a mess of similar tickets crammed in the glove compartment. the police car pulls by them. john scowls, then roars his engine and pulls back into the stream of traffic. cruising main street steve's '58 chevy terry is looking and feeling like he's got it made. he downshifts and slows for a red light. a very mean looking black '55 chevy blown, scooped and slicked pulls up next to him. the driver, bob falfa, has a gum chewing girlfriend sitting almost on top of him. terry challenges the '55 chevy by revving his engine. bob falfa doesn't even look over. he revs his engine which sounds like a cross between a boeing 707 and a superchief. terry can't believe it. he quits revving his engine feeling deflated. terry looks over at the snotty grin on falfa's girlfriends' face.}
<C>__{girlfriend}
<D>__{ain't he neat?}
<A>__{terry doesn't say anything and bob falfa glares over at him.}

<P>__{(giving another snotty smile)}
<D>__{ain't he neat?}
<A>__{terry doesn't say anything. there's another incredible scream as falfa roars off, leaving terry to stare through his smoke. terry accelerates the '58 chevy at a prudent speed. as the radio blares "almost grown," terry glides past the lighted stores slowly, taking in everything with wide eyes from his beautiful new car. terry passes a steaming rear end collision at an intersection where two guys and two girls are all yelling. then, suddenly, he spots a girl walking alone. his mouth drops open in amazement as he slows to a crawl. debbie, nineteen, with blonde hair, wearing a blue and white spaghetti strap dress, strolls along the sidewalk. terry rolls the powerful engine, but she ignores him. as he passes her, he speeds up.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{what a babe... what a bitchin' babe... and wolfman baby, she's all mine.}
<A>__{terry tears around the corner and starts his approach once more. he quickly whips out his comb, touches up his hair and settles down into a comfortable slouch.}

<A>__{he hits the clutch, roars the engine a couple more times and then disaster. debbie passes behind some rough looking dudes on motorcycles, parked along the curb. one especially vicious biker turns and looks at terry as he passes. terry roars off around the block.}

<D>__{stay cool, honey don't let those creeps bug you. wolfman, please don't let those creeps bug her... please.}
<A>__{as debbie passes the bikers, they hoot, holler, and make barnyard noises. from the cat calls, and debbie's manner it seems obvious that debbie is a girl a lot of boys have "known." she has walked clear of the bikers as terry screeches around the corner again. he pulls up alongside her and again slows to a crawl. the pass each other for awhile, but she doesn't look over.}

<C>__{carol}
<D>__{bunny rabbit! oh brother, you are such a drip.}
<A>__{she stomps off and gets back into the coupe, quickly rolling up all the windows. john saunters up and finds the door locked.}

<D>__{come on, open the door.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{if you say "carol's not a bunny, she's a foxy little tail."}

<C>__{wolfman }
<D>__{sneakin' around with the wolfman, baby.}
<A>__{the wolfman's gravelly voice whispers over the airwaves as john and carol drive out of the shadowy car grave yard. wilson's appliance store curt is sitting on the hood of a parked de soto watching a row of televisions in the window of an appliance store. twelve silent images of ricky nelson on "ozzie and harriet" glow in the dark showroom. music from passing cars rises and fades as they cruise behind curt. the wolfman can be heard.}
<C>__{wolfman }
<D>__{oh, this is gonna strike a raw nerve, mama. here's the platters.}
<A>__{the wolfman howls and the platters wail into the "great pretender." curt sings along, mouthing the words. then somebody walks in front of curt. curt pays no attention, then sense the presence of another guy. soon he realizes that he is being surrounded by a group of three hoods. they slink up from all sides wearing car coats with the name "pharoahs" embroidered across the back. curt looks them over they all watch the silent tv's. one of them, without turning, talks to curt.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{whadaya doin', creep?}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{me?}

<D>__{yeah... why?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no reason... he's a friend of ours... and that's his car you're sitting on.}
<A>__{there's silence. curt looks uneasy and slides quietly off the de soto. curt sticks his hands in his pockets and starts slowly down the sidewalk.}

<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{no place. not going any place.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ya must be going someplace i mean ya left here. bring him over here, ants, i want to show him something.}
<A>__{ants (a tall, ghoulish looking kid who probably got his name from the scar across his face which has recently been stitched to look like a party of ants marching across his cheek) brings curt back gently. joe is bent over looking across the hood of the de soto.}

<D>__{here bend down, look here. see that? right across there see?}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{i guess so yeah.}
<A>__{joe unbends and lightly punches curt on the shoulder.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you scratched it, man. where do you get off sitting on gil's car, huh, man?}
<A>__{joe gives him another charming punch on the shoulder. the others have left the tv's and are watching curt now, looking puzzled and pained at the scratch on the car.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's not much of a scratch. i don't think he'll even }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it ain't the size that's in question here. it's the principle. jeez, this is tough... what should we do with ya?}
<C>__{ants}
<D>__{tie him to the car and drag him.}
<A>__{curt turns and laughs at ants' suggestion. he laughs and laughs until he realizes nobody else is; they are pondering the suggestion.}

<D>__{that's funny}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we killed him last night.}

<D>__{well, i don't think i can i gotta }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i know just how ya feel.}
<A>__{joe leads curt gently but forcibly toward an incredible maroon '51 merc that's been lowered and chopped so that the windows are like ominous slits and the whole machine has a submarine quality. joe opens the door and curt slides into the white fluffy interior. in the small back window, a metal plaque reads "pharoahs." the third member of the gang is carlos, a short little kid about fifteen years old. he appears tougher than the rest with a cigarette dangling from his mouth. joe heads for the driver's side and ants and carlos both go for the front passenger door.}

<A>__{carlos gives ants a hard look and ants backs down and climbs in the back with curt. the pharoah's mercury roars out from the curb. cruising main street pharoahs' '51 mercury the radio blares "ain't that a shame?" as curt sits in the back seat of the car looking very nervous. he eyes the three hoods cautiously. they are sitting super low, their eyes just visible over the windows. then, curt happens to look around. he does a double take. through the narrow window he sees the thunderbird passing in the opposite direction. curt swivels and watches through the back window as the t bird disappears around a corner. then, he shakes his head. of all the times to be trapped with the pharoahs. on the radio the wolfman is giving a phone operator a bad time and the pharoahs are chuckling. as the wolfman continues on the radio, the cars pass though the night like a metallic ballet. the pharoahs' mercury (with curt aboard) passes laurie's edsel... inside the edsel, steve is driving. he puts his arm around laurie and she leans her head on his shoulder. as the edsel cruises by in one direction, john milner's '32 ford coupe rumbles by on the other side of the street.}
<B>__{inside the deuce coupe}

<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i just love listening to the wolfman. my mom won't let me at home. because he's a negro, i think... anyway, he's terrific. do you know that he just broadcasts from a plane that flies around in circles all the time? do you think that's true?}
<A>__{inside steve's '58 chevy terry drives on through the wonderful night a blonde sitting next to him, he's feeling very bitchin'. he and debbie are also mesmerized by the wolfman.}
<C>__{wolfman }
<D>__{floyd, i love you, floyd. is this you, floyd? i cannot look on thee, love took my hand... and smiling did reply, who made the eyes but i. floyd, reach out and touch my soul.}
<A>__{inside the pharoahs' '51 mercury even curt has to laugh at the wolfman despite his situation. little carlos sits in the front seat and looks over at joe who's driving.}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no, he don't. i seen the station right outside of town.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{that's just a clearing station, man. so he can fool the cops. he blasts that thing all the way around the world. it's against the law, man.}
<A>__{in the back seat, ants nods in agreement.}
<C>__{ants}
<D>__{ah, man they'll never catch the wolfman.}
<A>__{then ants' nose starts twitching and he looks over at curt suspiciously.}
<C>__{ants}
<D>__{hey, man, who cut the cheese?}
<A>__{curt tries to smile but looks pretty guilty. then joe looks around from the front seat.}
<C>__{joe}

<D>__{hey, creep, scoot down. sitting up like that, it wrecks the lines of the car, you know what i mean?}
<A>__{curt scoots down to a level even with ants. ants is staring at him and grinning evilly. then they hear an incredible roar, and they all turn to see bob falfa's black '55 chevy pass by. falfa has a new girl with him this time, a lovely redhead.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{there's that badass chevy again. look at he snatch he's got with him.}
<C>__{ants}

<C>__{carol}
<D>__{don't worry, i won't rape you.}
<A>__{carol slides back to her side. but as they glide along, carol watches john. she's moon eyed and flipped over him. john deftly down shifts as he approaches a light and then accelerates through the gears with a "race" expertise. there's a honk and john and carol look over to see a '60 cadillac full of girls laughing at them.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{you got a bitchin' car.}
<A>__{john nods modestly.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{in fact, we're gonna give you our special prize for having the neatest car around. you want me to give it to you?}

<C>__{girl}
<D>__{yeah, well get bent turkey.}
<A>__{the girl suddenly launches a water balloon, which john ducks deftly, the tumescent missile catching carol full in the face. the girls roar off. john cracks up as carol blinks away the water, not believing what's happened. she wipes her face.}

<B>__{main street intersection}
<A>__{carol jumps out of the car as john stops the car in the right hand lane next to the cadillac. as chuck berry wails "johnny b. goode," they go into action. the girls in the cadillac recognize john as one of their victims and quickly roll up all windows and lock their doors. john starts pulling the stems from the front tires, sinking the car. carol starts around the car with the shaving cream, spraying all their windows with the foamy lather. carol is having a great time and john is laughing as they continue their guerrilla attack. they finish and jump back in the coupe. the light turns green and john takes off, leaving the cadillac stranded at the intersection, covered with shaving cream. traffic begins to back up... horns begin to honk. canal bank steve's '58 chevy the crickets chirp under the full moon. we hear "i only have eyes for you" playing as the chevy slowly comes to a stop in an isolated spot along the irrigation canal. terry gets out of the car, pops the top off two cokes and pours half of them into the canal. he hums, refilling them with bourbon. he goes back to the car.}

<D>__{really?}

<D>__{do you still have 'em? we could go for a ride.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{no, i had to sell 'em. to get these wheels... and a jeep. i also have a jeep pick up, with four wheel drive. it's got a gun rack. and i use that for hunting mostly.}

<D>__{why do you kill little animals? i think that's terrible.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{oh, well, yeah, i figure with bears, though, it's either me or them... you know, i think you're really neat.}

<D>__{oh, jeez, i'm sorry. i don't know what got into me i didn't mean to maybe it's the booze or something.}

<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{there now.}
<A>__{suddenly, she grabs him and pulls him down on top of herself. she kisses him madly. at first he's surprised, but then gets the hang of it. they begin to neck passionately, encountering many obstacles in the cramped front seat.}

<D>__{you must've talked his ear off trying to get him to stay.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{that's not true. i didn't say anything. curt just said at dinner tonight he realized there was no big hurry. he thought he should take it easy for a while, go to j.c. and try to figure out what he wants to do with his life.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{that sounds logical.}

<C>__{steve}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{she smiles briefly, then turns and leaves. steve watches her go. mel's drive in the drive in remains a raucous roar: cars coming in from the hop, from the movies, other cars going out to the canal or back out to cruise. only the car hops, who have developed a late hour, harried look, suggest it's nearly closing time. the pharoahs arrive. the mercury swings imperiously into the lot. the radio can be heard as the rumbling engine dies. the clovers are singing "love potion #9." curt jumps out of the mercury elated. the pharoahs all climb out and circle him, punching him playfully. joe holds him while carlos tickles him and they all laugh.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh mother, it's been a glorious night.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{that was the bitchinest thing i ever seen in my whole life.}
<C>__{ants}
<D>__{i seen a little kid attacked by pigs once, but this was even better.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh boy, i will tell you something, that car must've jumped five feet in the air!}
<A>__{curt nods, feeling pretty good.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you sure you got to go? the night's young.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{yeah, there's some things i got to do. i still want to find that blonde.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i think she was an optical delusion, man. psychology wise it ain't good to dwell on it. you'll alter your ego or something. anyway, catch ya tomorrow night?}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{yeah, i guess so.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{guess so? man, we don't admit a lot of guys to the pharoahs. you understand we're going to have to swipe your jacket and all you gotta make up your mind.}
<A>__{curt nods, thinking about it. then he shrugs. he looks at the three pharoahs as they climb back into their maroon chariot.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{hey i will see you guys.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sure listen, remember, rome wasn't buried in a night.}
<A>__{joe laughs and curt nods. he watches the mercury pull out and then he wanders back across the drive in toward his little citroen.}
<C>__{wolfman }
<D>__{my, my, my. you only got five minutes left, if you want to talk to the wolfman. gonna make all your dreams come true, baby.}
<A>__{curt gets into the little car and sits listening to the radio. the neon mel's drive in is reflected across the windshield.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{wolfman...}
<C>__{wolfman}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{would you dedicate a record to keep me and my girlfriend together?}
<C>__{wolfman}
<D>__{are you separated?}

<D>__{well, see, we're havin' a little problem.}
<C>__{wolfman}
<D>__{i will bring you right together. hold on a minute, man. hi ya, hi ya, hi, hi, hi. everything's gonna be all right now, man, you understand? now, let me play the record for you.}
<A>__{as the wolfman talks on, curt glances toward the street. he sees the white thunderbird gliding by. he sits up quickly and tries to start the citroen but the machine barely turns over. he keeps trying desperately, but the engine won't catch. cruising g street '58 edsel laurie drives slowly, alone in the edsel. on the radio, the skyliners are lamenting the sad state of things "since i don't have you." laurie wipes her eyes, crying with the music. a horn honks. she looks over to see bob falfa's car pacing her. he's alone now and grinning at her. laurie ignores him. they drive along further. falfa roars his engine, but she still doesn't give him any attention. he gives up and pulls off. laurie thinks a while, pouting. she pulls alongside falfa at the next light. he isn't looking at her. she toots her horn and he turns. laurie motions him to pull over. falfa looks surprised. the light changes, and he follows her to the curb. laurie takes a deep breath, and with a determined look, gets out and walks back to his car. she gets in and closes the door. they start off. he looks over and smiles.}
<C>__{falfa}
<D>__{hey hey hey, baby, what do you say?}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{just don't say anything and we'll get along fine.}
<A>__{falfa is puzzled by the frigidity in the air. he glances at her then back at the road, wondering about this strange chick. residential street deuce coupe the coupe slows in front of a modest california ranch style home. john stops the car and turns off the engine. he looks over at carol, who seems lost in thought.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{this the first time you've been quiet all night.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i had fun. goodbye.}
<A>__{she sits for a moment, about to say something.}

<D>__{do you like me?}

<D>__{yeah. i like you. you're all right.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{but i mean, do you like me?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i, ah... i like you. okay?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{couldn't i have something to remember you by?}
<A>__{john gives in to her sweet gaze. he takes off the gearshift knob, gives it to her, and leans over and gives her a kiss.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{'bye, kid.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{gee, thanks. it's just like a ring or something.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah.}

<C>__{carol}
<D>__{well, i will see you around.}
<A>__{she jumps out of the car and runs up the walk to the house. he watches her stop at the screen door and turn. she gives him a little wave, then goes inside. john looks over at the empty seat next to him and seems a little sad. he starts the engine and drives off slowly.}
<C>__{wolfman }
<D>__{i haven't cried so much. and the tears and everything, man... i leaned down towards the microphone and i almost shorted myself out.}
<A>__{outside mel's drive in curt has the font hood up on the beetle like citroen and is fooling with the recalcitrant engine. steve is standing beside him.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{hold that up.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(taking the hood from him)}
<D>__{i've been thinking maybe you're right. why should i leave home to find a new home. why should i leave friends that i love to find new friends?}

<D>__{wait a minute, wait a minute. i've heard this already. aren't you the one who for eight weeks has been telling me you have to leave the nest sometime?}

<D>__{i realize that. i realize }
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{no no realizing. you've been telling me all summer that it's time to pull your head out of the sand and take a look at the big, beautiful world out there. gimme this thing.}

<D>__{wrong nothing. you've been talking about getting out of this town for eight weeks. and now goddamnit! you're just you're just mentally playing with yourself. if you can just relax, we'll talk about it at the airport.}
<A>__{curt walks around the side of the car and opens the door.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{where are you going? it's awfully early in the morning.}

<D>__{i have a dental appointment.}

<C>__{curt}
<D>__{just relax, wil ya? i will see you at the airport.}
<A>__{curt gets into the car and starts the engine. steve watches him pull out of the drive in, then walks off. alley behind the "come on inn" bar a half dozen people are standing around in the parking lot behind the bar. debbie is sitting on the hood of a car, swinging her legs and chewing gum. the people all seem to be watching something on the ground behind the car. coughing is heard, then gagging, and the unmistakable sounds of someone being sick. at the back door of the bar even the cooks are looking and pointing. we hear more coughing and vomiting. a guy slides up on the hood next to debbie.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i never seen a guy lose so much. he mustn't have been used to drinking.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{oh no, he really likes to drink. he told me.}

<D>__{gettin' late... i knew a man once who got this sick. billy webber. that was ten years ago. what do you think that was there, that he had for dinner?}

<P>__{(she grins)}
<D>__{he looks like a dog, doesn't he? looks like old ginger.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{sicker than a dog, that's for sure.}
<A>__{the people drift off, leaving debbie sitting alone on the car. now, terry slowly emerges, pulling himself up the hood of the car. his face is white. he lies across the hood trying to catch his breath.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{ohh rats, i feel like }
<P>__{(he notices a car}
<D>__{nearby and pushes}
<P>__{himself up)}
<D>__{wait a second... hey!}

<D>__{it's oh my god it looks like steve's car. look, right here under our it's my car. my car. we found it. look!}
<A>__{terry staggers around and looks for the keys. he searches under the front seat and over the visor. must've taken the keys with them.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{maybe we oughta call the police.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{never get here in time. i got a better idea. we'll just steal it back. see if you can find some wire around. we only need a foot to hot wire it... okay?}
<A>__{gas station deuce coupe john pulls the coupe out of the garage and wheels up to the pumps of the gas station. an attendant nods, looking at the roaring engine.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{took the header plugs off. expectin' some action?}
<A>__{john looks at him from inside the coupe and nods slowly.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah. think so. there's some punk lookin' for me.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{why the hell do they bother? you've been number one as long as i can remember.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah... it's been a long time, ain't it? i will see ya. thanks.}
<A>__{john drives the car out of the station and screeches down the street. alley behind the "come on inn" bar steve's '58 chevy terry is fiddling around under the dashboard, trying to hot wire the chevy. as the wires connect, the radio comes to life and the wolfman growls.}
<C>__{wolfman }
<D>__{who is this on the wolfman telephone?}
<A>__{there's the sound of a phone ringing, then the unmistakable voice of the big bopper answering.}
<C>__{big bopper }
<D>__{hellooo, baaaby }
<A>__{just then, terry looks up and sees one large badass looking at him. terry gets up slowly and sees another big guy standing nearby. the first badass reaches in and grabs terry by the shirt. he pulls him from the car. terry is smiling weakly.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{ah, hi this is my car. what i mean is, somebody stole my car i mean i lost my car and i want to thank you two guys for }
<A>__{the first badass shoves terry toward the other badass.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{ for returning i mean finding it. i mean, listen now, listen guys i've been sick recently, and this kind of activity can really be hard on a guy. now, easy will you? easy!}
<A>__{they throw him back and forth and start to rough him up seriously. debbie is running around helplessly while they pummel terry. then, she sees the yellow deuce coupe passing. john glances out his window and notices the fight behind the come on inn. he punches it and wheels into a fast u turn. the hoods have quit playing with terry and are punching him. terry's still on his feet, mostly because he's drunk and staggering away from a lot of the blows; also, debbie is screaming and pelting the assailants with her purse.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{stop it, stop it, stop it! help! police! you creeps!}
<A>__{john jumps out of the coupe and runs into the parking lot. he grabs one of the punks and turns him smashing him in the face. the punk lands on his ass. john starts circling the other.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{go, john!}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{hit him!}
<A>__{a good fighter, john lands a couple of blows to the gut and lands him on his can. both of them crawl off. terry is lying nearby, drunk, sick and bloodied. debbie holds his head in her lap. john goes over and kneels by them.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey, man, you all right?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{yeah. i will die soon and it'll all be over.}
<C>__{debbie}
<P>__{(looking at john)}
<D>__{wow you're just like the lone ranger.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(eyeing debbie)}
<D>__{yeah. listen, are you with the toad, or were you with them?}
<A>__{terry manages to raise his head.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{you're talking to the woman i love...}
<A>__{his head falls back again.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what happened, man?}
<A>__{terry opens his mouth to start to explain, but it's too hard. he can only moan. mel's drive in the drive in is emptying out finally as the midnight hour approaches and passes. the die hards and the hard ups are still wheeling through mel's looking for remains of any action. steve sits inside in a booth. two gossipy looking girls come in smiling and slide into the booth across from him.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{hi, karen, judy.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{hi, steve. have you seen laurie lately?}
<A>__{steve shakes his head no.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{well, we have.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(already annoyed)}
<D>__{oh yeah. so what?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{so nothing. she was just with a really cute guy in a boss car. we wondered who he was.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i wouldn't know.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{we do. his name's bob falfa.}
<A>__{the name registers with steve. terry and debbie pull into the drive in and park. terry, his face swelling, groans as he leans toward the intercom.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{help... i mean, i want two cherry cokes with lots of ice. never mind, forget the cokes, just bring the ice, pronto.}
<A>__{the intercom repeats his order in a foreign language and suddenly steve arrives and opens the door.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{out! out!}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{what??}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i need the car now.}
<A>__{terry gets out and debbie gets out her side. steve gets in.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i'm about to find out.}
<A>__{steve roars out of the drive in, leaving terry and debbie standing in an empty space.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i don't believe it! you practically get killed trying to get your car back, then you let him have it.}
<A>__{terry looks at her, his eye swollen, his lip ballooning, his glasses broken. finally, he gives up it's not worth the trouble any longer.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{it's not my car.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{it is not my car!}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{well, where is your car?}
<A>__{terry is upset now.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i don't have a car!}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you don't no car at all. what about your jeep?}
<A>__{terry shakes his head.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{no car... well, how am i going to get home?}
<A>__{just then the car hop approaches with the two cokes on two trays.}
<C>__{car hop}
<D>__{where's your car? i gotta hook 'em to your car.}
<A>__{terry shrugs, standing in the empty stall, the carhop with the trays and debbie watching. there's a low rumbling sound and the girls turn as john's deuce coupe glides into the stall next to them. terry shuffles toward john's car, a defeated man. terry leans against john's car and john looks out the window at him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what's wrong, toad? you lose the car again?}
<C>__{terry}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{no... steve took it.}
<C>__{wolfman }
<D>__{it's a shame, baby. i will tell yuh... got to take it easy when you're drivin' that car of yours. you got to cruise easy, baby. don't be doin' any accidents or anything on me.}
<A>__{and the radio plays "cryin' in the chapel." john smiles and gets out of the car. he goes and opens his hood, making a last minute check on something. terry sits down gently on a curb by john. debbie has been talking with some other boys. eventually she wanders up slowly and looks at terry. he looks up at her, then away, disgraced and embarrassed. she sits down by him and they're silent.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you know, i had a pretty good time tonight.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{oh come on, you're just }
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{no, no, really. i really had a good time. i mean, you picked me up and we got some hard stuff and saw a hold up, and then we went to the canal, you got your car stolen, and then i got to watch you gettin' sick, and then you got in this really bitchin' fight... i really had a good time.}
<A>__{terry looks at her, starting to regain a little cool.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{you think so? yeah well i guess i have pretty much fun every night.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{anyway if you're not doing anything tomorrow night, why don't you come over?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{yeah well, i might be busy, you know. but we could well, i got a little vespa i just play around with.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{really? why that's almost a motorcycle. and i just love motorcycles.}
<A>__{he feels his swollen lip and she touches it. then she leans over and kisses him.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i got to go.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{ow.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{see ya.}
<A>__{she smiles, walks off, swinging her purse. she looks over her shoulder and smiles. he smiles back. outside radio station citroen the little citroen bumps along a lonely dirt road, winding its way through dark peach orchards and wizened grape vineyards. curt watches the deserted landscape when suddenly, the radio increases in volume and he turns it down. then it begins to roar and distort eerily as the signal becomes more powerful. then curt sees it. he stops the car and gets out. he stands looking at an isolated white frame house hitting in the moonlight. curt looks up at a spidery radio antenna that rises toward the stars, its black wires humming in the stillness. curt starts up the gravel walk to the door. under the glare of a naked spotlight, he sees a small intercom which plays soft rock and roll. he hesitates, then pushes a buzzer. he pushes it again and finally a voice comes over the intercom.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{yeah, who is it?}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{it's i want to talk to the wolfman.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{the wolfman ain't here.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{i know, but i got to get in touch with him. i got something to give him before }

<D>__{no, i can't. i want to ask him something that }

<D>__{dedications by phone is diamond 75044. wolfman top 40 is box 13, chula vista. wolfman sweatshirts is wolf enterprises, bakersfield. 'bye.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{listen, i got a right to talk to him. i listened to him every night for as long for twelve years almost. i know him and it's personal and it'll only take a minute and i bet wolfman would be upset if he knew a friend couldn't get in touch with }
<A>__{a buzzer interrupts him and the door opens an inch. curt pushes it open slowly no one is there. a little scared, he goes inside and closes the door.}
<B>__{inside radio station}
<A>__{curt walks slowly down a dark eerie corridor, passing strangely lit rooms with electronic generators, humming dynamos and glassed off booths filled with flashing electronic apparatus. curt goes through this other worldly maze until he comes to a small, dimly lit control booth. a figure inside is barely visible through the reflections in the double glass windows. the figure turns and walks up to the window. curt backs off a bit. a face stares at him long hair greased in a ducktail, a short chinbeard. then he speaks, his voice filtering strangely through a hidden speaker.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<A>__{through the window, curt can be seen but no sound is heard.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{pull the red switch.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{i'm looking for a girl.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{aren't we all. she ain't here. come on back to the booth.}
<A>__{curt walks around through a few more glass doors and ends up in the booth with the manager. the manager sits down and leans back, turning a fan to blow on his large chest. he's a large, friendly looking man; he wears a hawaiian shirt. he sucks on a popsicle. curt stands awkwardly.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{hey, have a popsicle. the ice box just broke down and they're meltin' all over the place. you want one?}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{no. thanks. listen, ah...}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{have a popsicle.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{are you the wolfman?}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{no, man. i'm not the wolfman.}
<A>__{the manager leans forward and picks up a spool of tape. he holds it up as a magician would for audience inspection, then puts it on a machine. a record is about to end. as it does the manager punches some buttons and the record segues into a wolfman howl and then the distinctive wolfman voice takes over. the manager adjusts the monitor volume down and sucks his popsicle.}
<C>__{wolfman }
<D>__{who is this on the wolfman's telephone?}
<C>__{diane }
<D>__{diane.}

<D>__{hell, that's just a dedication. all i gotta do is relay it. and it'll be on the air tomorrow, or tuesday at the latest.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{no, no. see, this is very important. i may be leaving town tomorrow, and it's very important that i damn it, that i reach this girl right now.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{you don't know whether you're gonna leave town or not?}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{well, i'm supposed to go to college back east tomorrow. and i don't know if i'm gonna go.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{wait a minute. have a popsicle.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{sit down a minute.}
<A>__{curt sits down, undecided about leaving and upset about not being able to get in touch with the lovely creature he saw earlier that night.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{listen, it's early in the morning. now, i can't really talk for the wolfman. but i think if he was here he'd tell you to get your ass in gear. now, no offense to your home town here, but this place ain't exactly the hub of the universe, if you know what i mean. and well i will tell you this much the wolfman does come in here now and then, with tapes, to check up on me, you know, and when i hear the stories he got about the places he goes. hell, here i sit while there's a big beautiful world out there, don't ya know. wolfman comes in last time talking about some exotic jungle country, handing me cigars he says was rolled on the naked thighs of brown beauties. the wolfman been everywhere and he seen everything. he got so many stories, so many memories. and here i sit sucking on popsicles.}
<A>__{curt looks at him a moment.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{why don't you leave?}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{well, i'm no kid anymore. i been here a long time. and the wolfman well, the wolfman gave me my start and he's sorta become my life. i can't leave him now. gotta be loyal to the wolfman, you understand.}
<A>__{curt nods and stands. the manager swivels around and punches some buttons, putting on a commercial. he turns back.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i tell you what. if i can possibly do it tonight, i will try to relay this dedication and get it on the air for you later on.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{that'd be great. thanks. really.}
<A>__{he shakes the manager's hand, then wipes it on his pants.}

<A>__{curt goes out the door. he starts back out through the maze of windows and electronic machines. echoing throughout the rooms, the wolfman's raucous voice follows curt. the wolfman howls and curt turns. through the maze of glass, shifting like prisms, he sees the station manager sitting by the mike howling! then, he laughs and howls again, starting to sing a song called "bluebirds on my dingaling," pounding out the rhythm on the console.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{wolfman...}
<A>__{he backs away, leaving the wolfman, who's on his feet now, screaming out the end of the song, dancing by himself in the little glass room, from which his voice radiates out through the night and around the world... mel's drive in john is working under the hood of the deuce coupe when falfa's chevy drives into the parking lot. the radio is now blasting "heart and soul." terry moves over toward john's car. john doesn't look up, although he is quite aware of falfa's entrance. falfa slows down in front of john's car and revs his engine again. john looks up laurie is in the car with falfa. she looks determined not to seem as scared as she really is.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{hey, john, let me go with you. come on.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{naw, man. i can't take you when i'm racin' somebody.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{ah, come on. just let me go. so i can watch. or, i will flag you, okay?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{all right. go ahead.}
<A>__{terry starts to climb into the car. john looks over at falfa in the rumbling chevy.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{paradise road.}
<A>__{falfa grins and gooses the chevy, peeling out of mel's drive in. cruising main street falfa's '55 chevy falfa looks over at laurie, who is watching the road nervously.}
<C>__{falfa}
<D>__{all right now, where's this paradise road?}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{you just follow this street straight out of town... listen, if you're gonna race john milner, you can let me out right when we get there.}
<C>__{falfa}
<D>__{why don't you shut up, baby? you ain't said one word all night long. what a weird broad. but you're gonna appreciate me soon. you're gonna be hangin' on for mercy, when i get this sucker rollin'.}
<A>__{he accelerates the chevy, shifting up deftly. laurie looks scared now. cruising 10th street steve's '58 chevy steve is cruising along the almost deserted streets looking for laurie. a t roadster pulls up alongside and a guy shouts at steve.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{you heading out to paradise road?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{paradise road, i'm not }
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{some guy named falfa going up against milner.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{john's racing falfa?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{yeah. figured something was up, saw them going out of town real cautious and then }
<A>__{but steve is gone. dale looks surprised as the chevy roars off toward paradise road. mel's drive in pre dawn curt pulls into the parking lot just as the neon sign goes out. the last cars are leaving as the drive in shutters up for the night. curt stops next to the lighted phone booth and sits in his car, listening to the wolfman.}
<C>__{wolfman }
<D>__{i got a dedication here that's for a friend of the wolfman a special friend of the wolfman who's leaving town tomorrow and wants me to play the next song for a blonde young lady in a thunderbird. a white t bird, you understand? now my friend's named curt and he wants to talk to you out there, baby. so you meet him at burger city, or phone diamond 3132. now he's a friend of mine, you hear, and, little girl, you better call him, or the wolfman gonna get you.}
<A>__{the wolfman howls and curt smiles, leaning his chin on his hand, looking around the dark drive in, wondering about tomorrow. paradise road dawn john's '32 yellow deuce coupe and falfa's black '55 chevy are waiting side by side on a long, straight country road, their front wheels resting on a weather beaten starting line. the sky is getting lighter as the radio plays "green onions." there are about six to eight other cars parked off the road to watch the race. everything is quiet now, only the crickets ignoring the solemnity of the scene, and still singing. terry jumps out of john's car, john hands him the flashlight and he takes up a position in front of the two cars. john looks over at falfa, who's arguing with laurie.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey laurie, what in the hell are you doing in there? is she gonna ride with you?}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{mind your own business, john.}
<C>__{falfa}
<D>__{yeah, she's with me. you worry about yourself, man.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{everybody ready?}
<A>__{john settles back in the driver's seat and positions his hand on the gear shift, which we see is wrapped with rags because of the missing knob. both drivers start revvin' their engines; the tension builds. terry looks nervous, the engines start to scream and terry, his hands shaking on the flashlight, manages to flash it on. both cars roar off the starting line, tires smoking and screaming. terry has his hands over his head and is coughing in a cloud of smoke as they pass. john beats falfa off the line. out on the road, as they hit third gear, the cars are almost neck and neck. inside falfa's car, laurie looks scared to death. falfa looks insane as he tromps it. john hits fourth at about eighty five. falfa does likewise but starts to fish tail. laurie closes her eyes, almost crying falfa regains control nervously. falfa's engine is winding out incredibly and he begins to get the edge on john. the cars rocket through the dawn light along the flashing white line until suddenly falfa's car blows a tire, his front wheel slips off and the car shoots off into a tomato field, hits an irrigation ditch and begins flipping over wildly in a horrifying cloud of dust and smoke john sees the chevy leaving the road and screams to a halt, swimming through an unbelievable u turn and high tailing it back to the crash site. he is out of the car like a bullet, running across the dirty cloddy field. the crash car is beginning to burn in the engine compartment and john is panicked. meanwhile, the spectators have arrived, including steve, who jumps from his car and is running across the field. steve and john arrive at the fire at approximately the same time. they stop, the flames are getting higher, burning up into the trees now. steve looks around wildly he sees john and goes at him.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you stupid sonofabitch, she was in that car! why did you have }
<A>__{he takes a couple of swings at john, who finally manages to tackle him around the waist. they both get up looking at the flaming wreckage. then john moves around the side, crouching, trying to see past the flames suddenly, he stands and motions to steve to come over. they both circle the wreck. around behind the flaming car falfa is standing in a state of shock watching the car go up in smoke, while laurie is circling him, screaming and beating him with her purse.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{i said i didn't you lousy greasy jerk! you coulda killed me what's wrong with you. you clubfoot...}
<A>__{she beats at him, crying hysterically. steve runs over and grabs her, pulling her away. she fights at steve, too, not knowing what's going on.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{no, no, no. please, don't come near me. no, please. i think i'm gonna be sick. oh, steven.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{laurie, please.}
<A>__{standing in the early light, steve holds her. she throws her arms around him as the crowd develops along the irrigation ditch to watch the flaming car.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{oh, steven! oh, steven, please, don't leave me. don't leave me, steven.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i won't.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{i couldn't bear it.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i won't.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{believe me.}
<A>__{john looks at falfa who's shaking his head, watching the car dissolve.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{come on, before she blows.}
<A>__{he pulls him off by the neck of the shirt and when they're a few yards off, falfa's '55 chevy does blow exploding like a small a bomb, blowing it into modesto history. back on the road, john is heading toward his car, its engine still running, its door open. terry runs up, trotting alongside john like a puppy.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{jeez, did you show him! he'll probably never even get in a car again.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{he was faster.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{it was beautiful, john. just beauti what?}
<A>__{john stops by the open door of the deuce coupe. terry stares at him and squints against the rising sun.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i was losin', man.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{he had me, man. he was pullin' away from me just before he crashed.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{you're crazy.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you saw it.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{no, you creamed him, from right off the line. the guy never had a chance.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{shit, toad. the man had me. he was beating me.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{john, i don't know what you're talking about. it was the most beautiful thing i've ever seen. that guy, he might as well get a wheelchair and roll himself home. man, you got... you got the bitchinist car in the valley. you'll always be number one, john. you're the greatest.}
<A>__{john nods, then looks up at terry. his face is glowing, his glasses are smashed and his lip is swollen. john smiles.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{look at your glasses, man.}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{okay, toad. we'll take 'em all.}
<C>__{terry}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we'll take em... let's get out of here.}
<A>__{john climbs in the car. terry yawns and shakes his head.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{jesus, what a night.}
<A>__{he climbs in too, and the deuce coupe drives off slowly as the sun rises over the ploughed fields and on the radio we hear "only you." mel's drive in dawn citroen curt sleeps in the little car as the sky grows lighter over the empty parking lot. the phone is ringing in the booth. it continues to ring. finally curt becomes aware of it and opens his eyes. it takes him a moment to remember. then, panicked, he jumps from the car and rushes to the booth.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{hello, hello, hello!}
<A>__{a soft sexy female voice is on the other end of the line.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{curt?}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{yeah... this is curt, who is this?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{who were you expecting?}

<C>__{curt}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{it's important to me. you're the most perfect, beautiful creature i've ever seen and i don't know anything about you. could we meet someplace?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i cruise third street every night. maybe i will see you again tonight.}
<C>__{curt}

<C>__{voice}
<D>__{goodbye, curt.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{wait a second! wait a second!}
<A>__{but there's a click as she hangs up. curt looks at the phone a moment, then also hangs up. from the car radio, he hears the wolfman making kissing noises.}
<C>__{wolfman }
<D>__{little kiss on your ear. good night, sweetheart. i will see you later.}
<A>__{and then the spaniels duh duh duh duh duh into "goodnight sweetheart."}
<B>__{airport day}
<A>__{a dc 3 prop airliner is warming up its engines as it waits to take off from a small country airport. there aren't too many people around. just curt and his friends and family seeing him off. curt stands with a kindly looking couple in their fifties. he hugs his mother and shakes hands with his dad. then, curt moves to his friends. he shakes steve's hand.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{good luck.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{yeah, same to you. and i better see you there next year.}

<D>__{well, stay cool, man.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{ah don't do anything i wouldn't do.}
<A>__{curt smiles at terry, who has a bandage on his forehead. curt looks at john and they don't seem to know what to say. finally, john gives curt a little slap on the cheek.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{i will see ya, buddy.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i know, you probably think you're a big shot, goin' off like this but you're still a punk.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{okay, john. so long.}
<A>__{he walks toward the plane and they all wave. he looks around as he goes up the steps carrying a small bag and a portable radio. the stewardess smiles as he passes her. above the door of the plane it reads radar equipped. curt looks back again, then goes inside. the plane takes off down the runway and then climbs up into the sky.}
<B>__{inside the plane}
<A>__{curt listens to the radio as the plane takes off. it's playing "goodnight sweetheart." as the plane climbs and banks over the valley, the music fades and the station drifts between static and other stations...and then it's gone. curt turns off the radio and looks out the window. as the plane banks, through the window curt sees the white thunderbird crossing beneath on the small grey ribbon of highway. curt watches it. then the plane's shadow ripples over the car and it, too, is gone.}
<B>__{the blue sky}
<A>__{as the plane flies off against the blue sky we see cameos of curt and his friends: john milner was killed by a drunk driver in december 1964. terry fields was reported missing in action near an loc in december 1965. steve bolander is an insurance agent in modesto, california. curt henderson is a writer living in canada.}
