<L>__{interior caliban industries autopsy room night}
<A>__{damaskinos enters, followed by carter stevens. the guards remain posted at the main entrance of the room. damaskinos approaches, looking down at blade. blade stares back at him, still defiant, but fighting a losing battle. he's dying and he knows it. his breathing is shallow. it's an effort just to keep his eyes open.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<D>__{with every century, humans become more repulsive to me. once, you were souls to be taken, corrupted. but you have disgraced yourselves to being nothing more than blood and meat.}
<A>__{two surgeons snap on surgical gloves. stevens is enjoying seeing blade helpless.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{we're going to harvest you, blade.}
<P>__{(injecting fluid into blade)}
<D>__{bone marrow, organs, everything. your tissue's too valuable to let go to waste.}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{nomak is still out there.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<D>__{true, but thanks to you, we know his weakness. we can keep him contained. it's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{too bad you're out of it.}
<A>__{damaskinos is amused by blade's seeming lack of concern.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<D>__{and why is that?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{revenge. that's what nomak wanted all along. to pay back the people who created him.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{you may be right. fortunately for us, he has no idea where this facility is located.}
<A>__{blade smiles, laughing tiredly.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{he does now.}
<P>__{(off their concerned looks)}
<D>__{he's been watching me since the tunnels. following me. i led him right to you.}
<A>__{blade lifts up his hand, unfurling his previously closed fist. there is a deep gash in his palms.}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{just like a trail of bread crumbs.}
<A>__{damaskinos stares at blade's hand, then looks to the floor. a line of blood droplets lead back to the doors through which he entered.}
