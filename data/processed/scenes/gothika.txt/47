<L>__{interior rec room day}
<A>__{drifting past the female patients at their usual activities. some watch tv, play dominoes, some pretend to read, some stare out blankly. here's chloe at a table, engaged in some sort of trivia game with a tattooed southern redhead named jenna:}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{m.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{mallorol, matzine, megaphen, meallaril s, meleretten, meleril, mellaril, mellaril s, mesoridazine, methotrimaprazine, mixidol, moban modalina }
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{modalina? isn't that a band?}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{trade name for triflupoerazine. look it up.}
<A>__{chloe shrugs, if you say so. jenna resumes:}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{moditen, molindone, moltipress, motival. that's it for the 'm's.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{not bad. high potency neuroleptics starting with 'j.'}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{trick question. there's only jatroneural.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{what do you wanna bet?}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{bet you a soda.}
<A>__{chloe checks a reference book. nods, impressed.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{right on the money, cowgirl. twenty points and a soda.}
<A>__{camera follows her intent gaze to another patient, shelley (the same patient we saw earlier mid fit) moseying across the room. nervously takes a seat beside miranda.}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{hi there, doc.}
<A>__{it takes a moment for the heavily drugged miranda to react. she looks up slowly: eyes glazed, painfully out of it.}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{i never got shrinked by you but all i hear is nothing gets past you, i mean, that's just hearsay and i don't pay much attention to hearsay because now they say you hacked your husband with an axe but i say maybe it just slipped, right?}
<A>__{miranda notices shelley is toying with a wrinkled newspaper clipping. shelley catches this look and slides it over to her. without malice, like a child.}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{they put your picture in the paper.}
<A>__{it reads "school principal slaughtered. wife under arrest." photos of miranda, douglas, their house. miranda stares at it in disbelief. growing sick.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{how did you get this?}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{chloe did. who knows how? not me. around here i'm on a need to know basis about stuff and most stuff i don't need to know. my point is about people talking behind other people's backs. like before i was here, everything i did i thought, 'this'll get them,' wanting their approval, wanting them to say good things behind my back. but now i'm more anonymous, more myself. i'm shelley.}
<A>__{miranda slides the clipping back to shelley, clueless as to how to get out of this conversation, but shelley has no problem holding a conversation all by herself }
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{you're not like, undercover here, are you? they pulled that at spring grove, had a bunch of doctors pretend they were patients, see if they could handle it. most quit after day one. you're not, are you?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{no, shelley. i'm not undercover.}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{because if you were, i'm like the fort knox of secrets. ask anybody.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{that's good to know. but i'm not.}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{say no more.}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{i understand perfectly.}
<A>__{she hands miranda paper and some crayons, whispers:}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{drawing is a great cover. good luck to you.}
<A>__{with a wink, she's gone. miranda looks at the room around her: chloe spying on her in the corner, irene and the nurse sharing a laugh, other patients ambling about, arguing life among the insane.}
