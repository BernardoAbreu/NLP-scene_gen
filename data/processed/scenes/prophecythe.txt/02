<A>__{it's not the best part of town and probably never was. a place of seedy, anonymous brick flophouses shackled by rusting fire escapes, lying on an alley unique only for its bad drainage. it's here, in the dim, flinty light, that a figure enters. wearing a long coat and, despite the night, sunglasses, he pauses on the slimy asphalt and gazes up the sides of the flophouses, to their yellowish windows and competing mexican radio stations. one window, dark and quiet on the third floor, catches his gaze. there's a metal hand railing in the alley that the long coated figure effortlessly pops up onto. sunglasses focused on the window, he lowers himself into a motionless crouch, a perch, on the railing with the ease of a crow. or a gargoyle.}
