<L>__{interior loft the same night}
<A>__{molly, in a short terrycloth robe, is sitting in a chair. a magazine is on her lap but she is staring vacantly into the loft. she seems lost in the vast space. sam is pacing back and forth. there is a melancholy look in his eyes.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why can't you hear me, molly? i need you.}
<A>__{suddenly the bell rings. molly jumps. molly's finger is on the intercom. she seems unsettled.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{who's there?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{molly, it's carl. can i come up?}
<A>__{sam freezes. molly is surprised. she hesitates a moment and then pushes the buzzer to let him in. we hear carl bounding up the stairs.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{don't open it. he's a murderer, moll!}
<A>__{there is a knock. molly opens the door. carl seems buoyant, almost celebratory. he has a bag of fruit in his hand. he is still in a suit and tie.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hi. thanks. i know it's late. i'm sorry to disturb you. i felt bad about last night. this supernatural stuff just makes me so uncomfortable. i don't even read horoscopes.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{don't worry. it's okay.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{no it's not. you needed me to hear you and i didn't and that was wrong. i want you to know that i'm your friend, moll.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you were never our friend.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(holding out a paper bag)}
<D>__{hey, i brought you some japanese apple pears. i know you like them.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(taking the bag)}
<D>__{oh, that's so sweet.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{listen, can i come in for a minute? i won't stay long. i've had one of those days. maybe a cup of coffee?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no, moll. don't do it. don't let him in!}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(hesitating)}
<D>__{sure.}
