<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior studio street day}
<A>__{from far away, we watch as leo and pete come out of the writer's building and join a flood of dress extras, all done up in puritan pilgrim garb and heading for the commissary. as they move through the mob and emerge on the other side, it's clear that pete is reeling from something he's just been told.}
<B>__{pete and leo}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{peter, their hands are tied. you see that, don't you?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i... i don't believe this.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? they say you did.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{who the hell is this "they?"}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{congress, the fbi, red channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is. "they" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.}
<P>__{(deliberately)}
<D>__{now, did you go to any meetings?}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(on the spot)}
<D>__{no. yeah... i... i don't know. maybe i did. leo, this was before pearl harbor. i was in college. it was a bunch of kids, and i was just one of 'em. i didn't believe in what they were saying. hell, i didn't even know what they were saying!}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{so, you're saying that it's true. you went to a meeting of a known communist organization.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{leo, i was trying to impress a skirt. you know me, i'm non political. republican, democrat, communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{you should watch what you say.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i don't know who fingered me, but i'm not a communist!}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{kid, that cuts no ice with them.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{what? that i'm accused of being a communist when i don't happen to be one?}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{they know you were at that meeting, peter. they've been told, and they know.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{leo, you're my agent. tell "them" to take a flyin' piss. i didn't do anything wrong. i fought in the war, for crissakes!}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{fought? come on, pete, you ran the px at fort dix.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i was decorated.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{i know. a purple heart.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{you broke your arm. you were coming out of a bar. you were drunk.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{at least i was on our side! look, they want me to testify? i will testify. i will tell 'em anything they want to hear! jesus, leo, this is my career!}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{you can't testify.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{leo takes a gold cigarette care from his breast pocket, offers a cigarette to pete and takes one for himself.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{don't take this personally, kid. if it were up to me, i'd have you testify wearing your uniform and your medal, wrapped in a flag with one hand on your heart and the other hand on a bible. what can i say? i like you.}
<A>__{leo lights pete's cigarette and his own. puts a fatherly hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{they don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them. they just don't want you writing pictures for now. that's all.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{yeah, well, that's enough.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{peter, i believe in you. more to the point, i read your new script... um...}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{"ashes to ashes?"}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{that's the one, "ashes to ashes." i think it's great. but it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. you can't work until you're cleared and believe me, starting right now, i'm gonna do everything i can to make that happen.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{so, it is a blacklist.}
<C>__{leo}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{don't say that. there is no such thing as a blacklist.}
<P>__{(calm)}
<D>__{now, are you gonna play ball?}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(sullenly)}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(then, pissed)}
<D>__{leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!}
<A>__{leo blows out a thin stream of smoke.}
<C>__{leo}
<P>__{(hand on pete's shoulder)}
<D>__{kid, this is the united states government we're talkin' about. fair ain't the pointerior}
