<A>__{it is 1957, and we are in the deserts of utah. tony bennett sings "rags to riches" on the soundtrack. breath taking scenery stretches out on either side of a highway. the camera moves to reveal a nash ambassador as it labors up a hill. twelve cars are caught behind the thirty mile per hour pace. two cars decide to ignore safety and cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car.}
