<D>__{lenny's got it.}
<A>__{as shifty walks to the car he discreetly backhands a roll of money to glen. seated in the driver's seat sits lenny, a frail man, eyes sunken, hair thinning. his denim jacket giving him the only dignity from looking like a walking corpse. seated next to him is loretta. she's pulling out a crack pipe itching to take a hit. shifty leans through the window and in one swift move takes a package from lenny, slipping it into his jacket, and drops a pile of cash into his lap.}
