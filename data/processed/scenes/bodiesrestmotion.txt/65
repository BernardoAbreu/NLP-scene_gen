<L>__{interior a bar in enfield night}
<A>__{a dimly lit room filled with raucous customers and lots of neon beer signs. waitresses in red dresses tote pitchers of brew to the thirsty throng. at the far end a band plays a foot stompin' good time tune about a trucker on his way to see his woman. the camera moves through the crowd and discovers carol and beth sitting at a small table, an almost finished pitcher of beer between them. they speak loudly to be heard over the din.}
