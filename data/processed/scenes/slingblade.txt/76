<A>__{all the lights are out. we see a shot of frank in his bed asleep, but tossing and turning. then a shot of linda in bed staring at the ceiling and doyle beside her snoring. suddenly, the lights come on and linda lets out a little yelp and sits up, which wakes up doyle and he sits up with a start. from their p.o.v. we see karl standing in the door holding a hammer.}
