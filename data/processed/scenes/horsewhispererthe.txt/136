<A>__{they walk towards his pick up truck.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{can you drive?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{drive? i'm not old enough yet.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's never too soon to start.}
<A>__{he enters the passenger side.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i can't...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i don't have all day.}
<A>__{she hesitates and gets into the truck.}
<L>__{interior pick up truck day}
<A>__{grace doesn't know what to do.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{put the key in and turn it.}
<P>__{(grace obeys)}
<D>__{the right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i don't know if i can with my leg.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well, there's only one way to find out.}
<P>__{(puts truck in gear)}
<D>__{give it a little gas.}
<A>__{she awkwardly puts her prosthetic foot on the gas pedal. too much. it lurches forward. she takes her foot off.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well, we know you can. now you just got to feel how much. try it again.}
<A>__{she does. they slowly, very slowly, move along the dirt road.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{nice, real nice. there's a little road down at the end here, turn onto it.}
<A>__{grace badly oversteers, but makes the turn. she drives along the road, across a pasture, heading toward distant mountains.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{just follow this. nothing to it. i'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. just keep going till you run out of road.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(afraid)}
<D>__{i don't know if i can.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{not a question of if you can you are. just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.}
<A>__{folding his arms over his chest, shutting his eyes, tom relaxes back. grace locks her hand on the steering wheel and her eyes straight ahead...}
