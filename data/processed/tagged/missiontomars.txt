<L>__{exterior late afternoon sky}
<A>__{blue sky, a few puffs of cloud, pierced by slanting rays of sunlight. late afternoon on a perfect day. super title: "houston, texas. july 4, 2020." as we hear, after a few more beats, an astronaut's voice.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{t minus ten, nine, eight, start ignition sequence, five, four, three, two, one, ignition... liftoff!}
<A>__{a tiny red streak zips into the sky, then bursts with a faint, ludicrous pop. a bottle rocket. we hear children's laughter, excited shouts.}
<L>__{exterior lawn party. luke graham's house. late afternoon}
<A>__{descending, we see phil ohlmyer, late 20's, kneeling, with a gaggle of eager children around him. phil, an astronaut, has got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using an empty longneck as his launching tube.}
<C>__{children}
<P>__{(all at once)}
<D>__{my turn! my turn! no, i was next! no, me! uncle phil, uncle phil, can i do one? i want to do one!}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{guys, guys, please! this is risky stuff here. and i'm a highly trained professional.}
<A>__{derisive groans from the kids, more shouts. phil grins. there's little danger nasa will ever use him on a recruiting poster: he's messy, very hyper. phil waves his hands for silence.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{okay, okay! uncle phil will launch another booster...}
<A>__{another astronaut, renee cote, a tall, very fit french woman, is walking by with a fresh six pack. she tosses a beer and phil catches it.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{...just as soon as he completes his fuel intake.}
<B>__{angle follows cote}
<A>__{who grins, walking away from phil and the kids, as we begin to get a better sense of the scope of this party. we are in the big back yard of a middle class home in a houston suburb. dozens of people astronauts, nasa personnel, and their families are gathered around picnic tables or spread out blankets. lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of balloons. we hear snatches of music, mostly country flavored, from dueling boomboxes. futuristic frisbees are being tossed about. a banner, strung between trees, reads "bon voyage, mars one!!!"}
<C>__{willis}
<D>__{it'll take us six months just to get to mars. another year on the surface, then six months back. that's two years...}
<A>__{passing the banner, cote lobs a beer to another astronaut, nicholas willis, who snags it neatly. he's got his other arm around the waist of a pretty girl. as cote moves out of frame, angle lingers on these two. willis, a very young astronaut, early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all too well.}
<C>__{willis}
<D>__{i guess what i'm trying to say is, since this is my last night on earth, it's gonna be a very precious memory to me. y'know?}
<C>__{pretty girl}
<D>__{nice try, nick.}
<A>__{as the pretty girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and walks away, willis shrugs philosophically. he pops open his beer, swigs it. angle follows the pretty girl as she swerves around an open pit barbecue, where other astronauts are gathered. cote has paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. sergei kirov, a russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as they play a game of wiffle ball. he turns, grinning beerily at the chef.}
<C>__{kirov}
<D>__{hey, woody, our mars one crew won't be heading back to earth till ten days after you guys land at our base camp with mars two. that's a pretty good long rendezvous.}
<A>__{woody blake, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat over a hawaiian shirt and a "kiss the chef" apron. an entire pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and woody is basting this as he smiles at malik.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{what are you suggesting, sergei?}
<C>__{kirov}
<D>__{maybe you should bring a baseball bat. yes? american baseball? our two crews could have ourselves a little solar system series.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{please. half you guys are foreigners. we'd crush you.}
<C>__{kirov}
<D>__{no, no, we have equal crews. three men, one woman. same handicap.}
<A>__{he grins teasingly at cote, who makes a face at him.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{easy now, you're talking about my wife.}
<P>__{(seeing her approach)}
<D>__{and terri just happens to be one helluva shortstop.}
<A>__{dr. terri fisher, early 30s, passes by with a platter of corn on the cob. short, sturdy body, a face made attractive by its alert, questing intelligence. she pauses to kiss woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them. then she glances at kirov, all business now.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{fast pitch, no steals, batter calls his own strikes. thousand bucks make it interesting?}
<A>__{he's a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at cote, who smiles, nods her cool agreement.}
<C>__{cote}
<D>__{eh bien. winner take all.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{good.}
<P>__{(smiles sweetly at kirov)}
<D>__{bring some balls.}
<A>__{the other men ooooh at this, busting on kirov and cote, as terri moves on. woody, watching her go, has a thousand watt grin.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you wanna know the sad part? technically i outrank her. but if we want any peace at all on mars two, i'm gonna be saying a lot of "yes, dears."}
<A>__{the others laugh. angle follows terri as she dodges a pack of kids they run by her, shrieking happily before she finally reaches a picnic table, where astronauts' wives are opening containers of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad.}
<D>__{1st wife ...just not sure how i feel about nasa allowing couples to go on this type of mission together.}
<A>__{one of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st wife turns, sees terri setting down her platter.}
<D>__{1st wife}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{nothing personal, terri. it's just that, well, it's kind of a funny feeling for those of us staying behind.}
<C>__{terri}
<P>__{(carefully neutral)}
<D>__{all the research shows that marriage will provide stability on these long duration trips. 2nd wife then they haven't studied some of the couples i've known.}
<A>__{laughter at this. terri smiles politely she doesn't really have much in common with these women before moving on. angle lingers on the wives, who watch her go with a slight tinge of jealousy. one of them is looking around.}
<D>__{3rd wife anybody seen jim mcconnell? 4th wife i don't think he's coming. 1st wife god, that poor man. how's he doing? 2nd wife totally losing it, from what i hear. can't sleep, can't eat. visits her grave almost every day.}
<P>__{(lowers her voice)}
<D>__{they say he could lose mission status. 3rd wife oh, that's so sad. that is just so tragic. you go to a routine physical one day, and wham. 4th wife after all those years of training, too. it was their whole dream. 1st wife must be a pretty funny feeling for luke graham. y'know? now he's gonna be in the history books. first man on mars...}
<A>__{she shakes her head, awed by the thought. the others nod in agreement, following her glance... in the distance, a lone male figure stands by the garage, his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and suvs which stretch down the driveway and along the street. another figure, a woman, can be seen approaching him. closer angle follows the moving woman debra graham, early}
<L>__{30s, very attractive until she reaches her husband. luke}
<A>__{graham, mid 30s, has the lean, fit body of an astronaut, the restless intellect of a scientist. he's unaware of her approach until she touches his shoulder. he looks at her with an apologetic smile.}
<C>__{debra}
<D>__{he's not coming, luke.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{jim deserves this, too. all his friends are here. and it's my last night.}
<C>__{debra}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{your last night with us, too.}
<A>__{he looks at her, moved. she summons a smile. he slides his arms around her waist, kisses her forehead.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i love you, deb.}
<C>__{debra}
<D>__{i love you too, baby. but maybe you should spend some time with bobby.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah. i will. where is he?}
<C>__{debra}
<D>__{up in his fort.}
<A>__{he kisses her again, then goes. debra's eyes follow him, with a mixture of pride and sadness. angle follows luke away from the garage, into}
<L>__{exterior the back yard. late afternoon}
<A>__{luke moves through the crowd. phil and the kids are still shooting off rockets. red streaks arc high overhead. in the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to pretty girl #2.}
<C>__{willis}
<D>__{deep space is so lonesome. so cold. but i guess i will have my memories to keep me warm...}
<A>__{luke shakes his head. willis is incorrigible. finally he reaches a tall redwood playset. he looks up the ladder. a small boy sits on the platform of the tower, arms around his knees, staring up at the stars. a telescope rests nearby on a tripod. he looks lonely. luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him. bobby, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at the sky.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{who's gonna read to me now, at bedtime?}
<A>__{luke is surprised by the question. a pause.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{mommy will.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i like when you do it. now we're never gonna finish our book.}
<A>__{his voice is unexpectedly fierce. he's fighting back tears. luke is moved. another brief silence.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, i will tell you what. i've been thinking about that. and what i thought was how 'bout if i bring along my own copy?}
<P>__{(bobby looks at him)}
<D>__{then every night, wherever i am, i will read a little bit more of it. and i will know that you and mommy, wherever you are, you're reading it too. that way, it'll feel like we're still reading it together. 'cause i don't know about you, but i'm pretty anxious to find out how 'ol ben gunn got marooned on that island. what d'you say?}
<A>__{bobby manages a smile. he nods, feeling a little better. luke is proud of his son's courage.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{good deal. can i have a hug?}
<A>__{bobby's arms go around his father's neck. he hugs luke fiercely, and luke hugs him back. his eyes, over the thin young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence. then, from the distance, the sound of an approaching car. they both turn. an open jeep is coming down the street. its driver is alone. luke's expression changes. recognition, then happiness.}
<L>__{exterior luke's street. late afternoon}
<A>__{the jeep stops, its electric engine whirring down. the driver climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon. the party sounds are drifting this way, and he hesitates a moment, seeming to gather himself. he starts gamely towards the party, then pauses again. debra graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting. she smiles tentatively. jim mcconnell, early 40s, manages a smile in return. he has dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in. yet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet competence in this man, an unforced authority; he's a natural leader. debra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her. they separate, looking at each other. her eyes are shining.}
<C>__{debra}
<D>__{we were afraid you wouldn't come.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{i caught a whiff of your barbecue. after that i was helpless.}
<C>__{debra}
<D>__{all the way out in galveston?}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{something like that.}
<P>__{(she smiles)}
<D>__{it's his night, deb. i didn't want to spoil it.}
<C>__{debra}
<D>__{spoil it? he's been going crazy looking for you.}
<A>__{over her shoulder he sees luke approaching, his arm around bobby. the two men look at each other, the bond between them so strong it needs no words. finally luke smiles.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{c'mon. a whole lot of folks here are gonna be mighty glad to see you.}
<A>__{mcconnell comes towards him, accompanied by debra, and together the four of them move out of frame, heading towards the party. angle holds on the parking area, as we...}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior same view. night (hours later)}
<A>__{all the parked cars and vans are gone now, except for two: mcconnell's jeep and woody's classic 'vette. willis, one of the last to go, is just departing on his motorcycle. perched behind him, arms around his waist, is pretty girl #3. they zoom away, through the darkened neighborhood.}
<L>__{exterior back yard. night}
<A>__{the yard is nearly deserted. the "bon voyage" banner has torn loose at one end and flutters limply. here and there a napkin blows across the ground. in the distance, three figures sit on the ground, by the waning fire of the barbecue pit, sipping beers.}
<B>__{closer on this trio}
<A>__{as woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames. for a moment he, mcconnell, and luke are silent, staring at the sparks as they rise towards the stars red and gold dots mingling with the silver ones.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{i wish we were all going. together.}
<A>__{the intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even woody himself. luke glances at mcconnell. an awkward beat.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{then you've got a short memory. think back to how we were by the second week of lunar training.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{oh, you're not gonna bring that up again }
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i'm trying to remember, let's see, which one of us scored the lowest ranking up there?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you just can't let that go }
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, man, three commanders, on the same ship? if they sent us off to mars together, there wouldn't be enough fuel to lift all those egos.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{bullshit, we would've made a great crew.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{that was never gonna happen. i was always teamed with maggie, and we were mostly chalkboard jockies. you know? systems. payloads...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{listen to him. mr. cover of time magazine!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{yeah, who landed the crippled block ii shuttle?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah, and who scored highest on the lunar rankings?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{let it go, luke.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{sure, i made a little noise. but putting the first footprints on mars? nah. that's for guys who...}
<P>__{(looks at luke)}
<D>__{...wrote their ph.d. thesis on how to colonize the place. and guys who...}
<P>__{(looks at woody)}
<D>__{...read too much science fiction as a kid and still wear little flash gordon rocketships around their necks.}
<A>__{he grabs playfully at woody's neck. woody smacks his hand away, laughing.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you read the same damn science fiction books that i did! you're just not man enough to wear jewelry!}
<A>__{he pulls from his shirt a little flash gordon rocketship emblem hanging on a chain, and waggles this tauntingly at mcconnell, as luke and mcconnell laugh.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you want flash. you know you want him. well you'll have to come through me!}
<A>__{luke grabs woody's arm to give mcconnell a better shot at the emblem, but woody cuffs his hands away, laughing. mcconnell, watching their horseplay, shakes his head.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{god, she would've loved to see you two clowns. just one more time.}
<A>__{he tries to smile, but his face reddens. then all at once his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions. woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but mcconnell shakes him off, rises abruptly. he turns his back on them, walking away a few steps. woody and luke exchange a worried glance.}
<L>__{exterior luke's street. later that night}
<A>__{mcconnell and luke watch as woody starts up his corvette. mcconnell has regained his composure.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hey, woodrow, isn't it about time you donated this thing to a museum?}
<A>__{woody revs the engine, which roars lustily. he grins.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{internal combustion, boys. accept no substitutes.}
<A>__{luke laughs. woody looks at mcconnell.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{jim, if there's ever... if there's anything terri and i can do }
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{i'm okay. really. thanks.}
<A>__{woody reaches out to shake luke's hand.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{see you when i get to mars, luke. don't solve all the mysteries of the universe, okay? leave a little something for the next guys.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i will see what i can do. just make sure you bring some fresh beer.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you got it.}
<A>__{with a final glance at mcconnell, woody slips the car into gear. mcconnell and luke watch as he drives away. a silence. luke glances at his old friend, growing more serious. we sense he's been waiting all night for a chance to say this.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{should've been your mission, jim. yours and maggie's.}
<A>__{mcconnell, looking after woody's car, becomes very still.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{none of us ever wanted mars the way you two did. not even woody. twelve years of hoping for this assignment, training for it }
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{that's all over now.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{if maggie hadn't gotten sick if you hadn't pulled yourself out of the rotation to take care of her }
<A>__{mcconnell turns to him, his eyes flashing danger. he will not tolerate pity. luke sees this but presses on.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no, i'm gonna say this. i have to say it...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i wanted mars one. hell, i battled you for it every step of the way. never wanted to beat anybody so bad in my life. but not like this... jim, i'd give this all up in a second, if it would bring maggie back to us.}
<A>__{mcconnell is deeply moved, and for a moment doesn't trust his own voice.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{i know that, luke. you don't have to say it... mars is yours now. go get it.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{take care of yourself.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{yeah. you too.}
<A>__{luke nods. they grab hands for a second, then let go. luke walks back towards his house. mcconnell watches him for a moment, then turns, walks over to his jeep. he opens his door, then pauses. he turns. looks up at }
<L>__{exterior night sky}
<A>__{a tiny reddish dot hovers there, glowing steadily. mars itself, a tantalizing prize. but for him now, more distant than ever. for him, perhaps, never to be attained. close on mcconnell's face as we see these thoughts going through him. after a moment he looks down at}
<B>__{his shoes}
<A>__{and the sandy verge of the front yard. mcconnell's eyes are a map of complex emotions: regret, injured pride, infinite yearning. gently, a bit self consciously, he lifts one shoe and sets it down again, making a careful, deliberate footprint in the sandy soil...}

<A>__{sequence from original script.}
<L>__{exterior mars. chryse planitia. day}
<A>__{instantly we're hurled into an immense, stunning landscape, mysterious and vivid as a fever dream. dazzling sunlight. a vast plain of rust orange soil. countless craters. boulders the size of houses, tossed about by the hands of gods. twin moons hanging in a salmon pink sky. on the horizon, towering, craggy peaks. and, at center the only sign of life a small, mysterious, moving puff of dust.}

<A>__{sequence from original script.}
<L>__{exterior mars. day}
<A>__{closer angle as a small, sojourner like, multi wheeled robotic vehicle ambles into frame, jouncing along the orange martian soil, pausing to snuffle its sensors towards the occasionally interesting rock. lettering on its side reads "ares 8." super title: "mars. plains of cydonia. eight months later." suddenly ares 8 pauses. its video lens whirrs out, fine tuning focus, as it becomes intrigued by something offscreen a higher, more distant target. the little fellow almost quivers with excitement.}
<L>__{exterior mars. tiu vallis. day}
<A>__{a one man atv rover waits in the background, in a dry streambed, as luke, in an eva spacesuit, swings a clawed rock hammer against a multi layered, sedimentary rock face. reddish dust coats his bulky white suit. despite that bulk, he moves easily in the light martian gravity (1 3 earth's). a hunk of rock breaks off, and luke examines it more closely, holding it up to his clear faceplate. he's very happy, absorbed in this work, when his radio crackles.}

<D>__{luke, you read me?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah, renee.}
<C>__{cote}
<D>__{luke, i just got ares 8 on line and... well, we think you're gonna wanna see this for yourself.}
<A>__{luke, though reluctant to break off work, is intrigued.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{copy that.}
<A>__{as luke turns away, headed for the rover}
<B>__{we pull wide}
<A>__{to reveal a staggering prospect, seen for the first time: valles marineris, that planet creasing slash. so wide, so deep, it boggles the mind: on earth it would reach from new york to l.a.}

<B>__{video screen}
<A>__{we see a low angle image of an elongated, rubble and dirt covered mountain. hard to tell scale, but it looks huge. what's most striking, however, is a white peak barely protruding through the rubble two thirds of the way along the mountain's ridgeline. its whiteness is in clear contrast to the typical rust orange of the surrounding rubble; what's more, this strange little peak also displays an oddly smooth, multi planed symmetry.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what the hell is that?}
<C>__{cote}
<D>__{no idea, boss.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{where is it?}

<D>__{you don't wanna know.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{c'mon, what's so funny? gimme the coordinates.}

<D>__{oh no. you're not telling me }
<A>__{they all laugh as the other shoe drops. luke's expression is incredulous, exasperated.}
<C>__{cote}
<D>__{oui. exactement! it's kirov's fault, he picked today's sector.}
<C>__{kirov}
<D>__{hey, c'mon! we've got a scientific duty to check that thing out.}
<A>__{luke sits, taking over the ares remote control from cote. they all watch as he fine tunes the image, trying without success to coax more resolution.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{great. that's great. the first anomaly we hit, and it's gotta be in the one place guaranteed to make nasa look ridiculous... you know how many books have been written about that damned mountain?}

<D>__{no, the amazons.}
<C>__{willis}
<D>__{no, it was little green men!}

<C>__{luke}
<D>__{why did that stop?}
<A>__{a split second later, he gets his answer. we hear a whoosh, a mighty rushing of wind, as a gigantic, translucent cylinder starts to swirl and rise, straight up from the top or the mountain, at its center. as it swirls, the cylinder picks up debris pebbles, sand from the sediment encrusted surface of the slopes.}
<B>__{the four astronauts}
<A>__{stare up at this spectacle, awed. a cyclone? some kind of energy wave? they have no idea. at the moment they're too fascinated to even be scared. tilting up from their pov we see the whirling cylinder rise, higher and higher, perfectly straight, until in just moments it's as tall as a skyscraper. as it rises, it gains speed and power, narrowing at its top into a conical vortex. it's sucking up so much dirt, so many rocks even small boulders now that the accumulating debris begins to darken its swirling, translucent outer "skin".}

<B>__{luke is alarmed}
<A>__{and the spell is broken. he keys his throat mike, his lips moving, but no sound can be heard over the roaring wind. he waves his arms, motioning for the others to back away, towards the rover. wind whips at their eva suits as they obey him, retreating. luke, backing away himself, is afraid to take his eyes off the cylinder. then he sees that one man willis hasn't moved. in fact he's busily snapping photographs of the cylinder. luke hurries over to him, tugs his sleeve.}
<B>__{willis lowers his camera}
<A>__{but still stares up, transfixed, like a man face to face with a cobra. luke follows the young astronaut's frightened gaze, and his own eyes widen as he sees}
<B>__{the top of the vortex}
<A>__{beginning to tilt down, then coil sideways. suddenly they're looking into the huge open "mouth" of it, as sand and rocks fly into the swirling darkness... the monstrous, gaping maw slithers down over the rim of the mountain, turning this way, then that. seeking them. and then, with horrifying precision, it locks in on the little group of astronauts. and lunges towards them...}

<A>__{luke and willis turn, running as hard as they can towards the rover. but the suction is so great, it's as if they're held back by wires. the ground itself is shaking, rumbling, as earthquakes begin to open fissures across the plain. the roar of the vortex, the groaning of the earth, are like an onrushing freight train...}
<B>__{ahead of them}
<A>__{in the maelstrom of flying debris, they can barely make out cote and kirov, still retreating, leaning back with all their strength against the suction, while staring up, aghast. suddenly a hurtling rock, the size of a basketball, smashes into cote's helmet from behind, crushing it and killing her instantly. blood sprays into the wind, immediately crystallizing, in the sub zero atmosphere, into red pellets... luke, horrified, flings his arm up as bloody hail patters against his faceplate and forearm. an instant later he sees}
<B>__{kirov}
<A>__{snatched up by the wind, then swept past him, in a terrifying blur, arms and legs flailing, mouth open in a silent scream as he vanishes... the ground at luke's feet abruptly opens, and he slides into a fissure. scrabbling frantically with his gloved hands, he manages to momentarily arrest his fall, gripping the edge of the fault line, with his helmet and one elbow thrust over its lip. the air is almost solidly choked with debris, deadly boulders bound over him, and torrents of cascading sand are burying him alive...}
<B>__{close on luke}
<A>__{barely conscious, as he watches, for a horrifying final instant, as... his last crewman, willis is sucked bodily into the black maw of the vortex, spinning and tumbling like a rag doll... close on willis's face his features grotesquely distorted by the forces tearing at him, before suddenly his faceplate is sprayed with blood, and... distant angle luke's pov willis's spacesuit explodes, his entire body disintegrating into a million bits, which instantly disappear into the hellish maelstrom. and then that maelstrom itself, just as abruptly... stops. vanishes. there is an instant, ringing silence, as awesome in its own way as the roaring storm itself had been...}
<B>__{wide angle}
<A>__{on the plain, as the last pebbles, released from suction, pitter down, bouncing. swirls of dust and sand drift away, settling gently. the harsh orange landscape is once again calm, peaceful. and then, from the direction of the nearby mountain, we hear another sound: the deep bass pulsing rumble returns.}

<D>__{the orbits are all wrong. our first decent launch window is almost eight months from now.}

<C>__{woody}
<D>__{yeah. because you washed him out.}

<C>__{woody}
<D>__{when maggie died, yeah, it knocked the shit out of him. it knocked the hell out of all of us. but you know and i know that he's still the best we've got. he and maggie wrote the book on mars. he's got more hours in the sims than the rest of us put together. ray, we can do this. give me mcconnell as co pilot, and we will bring luke home. and that's a promise.}

<A>__{mcconnell's face is spinning and shaking too, more and more violently, as the huge buildup of g forces tears at his body. we're reminded of nick willis just before the vortex exploded him; is the same thing about to happen to mcconnell? his eyes remain tightly shut, bubbles are streaming from his lips. his last breath is nearly exhausted, it's being shaken from his lungs.}

<A>__{as we move in closer on his face, we suddenly see, with him, a series of rapid fire, almost subliminal images from the past. we recognize each one. previously, though, we saw them as still photos; now they have movement, life, and we view them from new and slightly different angles. these images}

<A>__{in an astronaut's pressure suit, drifts rapidly towards us, reeling in along a tether. a man's gloved hand is outstretched, reaching for her. as she grips the hand, we see her triumphant expression through her faceplate. a blinding flash; she's gone... mcconnell's face in the present is shaking savagely; he is very near death. and then, all at once, the shaking stops. time itself seems to stop. mcconnell opens his eyes, staring straight at us. and then, fully accepting his fate, he throws his head back, opens his mouth and takes in a deep lungful of the fluid. he can breathe it. his eyes widen in surprise and understanding. he can breathe it! this fluid will keep him alive! his whole body relaxes, the tension draining from his head and shoulders, as he fully trusts this launch for the first time. and then, with his eyes wide open, he sees, from memory, one final image...}
