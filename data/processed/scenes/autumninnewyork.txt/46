<L>__{interior elysium late afternoon}
<A>__{the restaurant is empty. john stands behind the bar, taking an inventory of the liquor. in the background, two bussers mop up. wills sits on a bar stool, nursing a mineral water }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{not much. i took her home and she pointed out an irony that fate was now offering us the very same thing that just this morning i'd told her was all i could offer her: a relationship with no future.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{a kid figured that out?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{she's not a kid! that's what i've been trying to tell you. nothing's lost on her. i'm the kid. she... i don't know what the hell she is...}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{but i do know what she was.}
<A>__{john looks at him curiously. wills glances over his shoulder at the bussers, then leans in close }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{a virgin.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{the busboys turn their heads.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i had no idea. that's the only reason she had her party here, so she could lure me into doing the honors.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{she used you, pal.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the hangman got hanged. how's it feel?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{embarrassing.}
<A>__{john laughs. wills settles into a brooding silence. john goes back to work }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so what now?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i end it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{what, you're endorsing this now?}
<A>__{john, continuing his work, smiles sweetly }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't know, when you talk about her, you're not such an arrogant son of a bitch. you get all whiny and stupid. i like that.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{and since i don't see you gettin' serious with any of your other victims, i figure why not spend a little time together?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{because she's dying.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i got bad news for you, brother, so are you.}
<A>__{wills stares at him thoughtfully.}
