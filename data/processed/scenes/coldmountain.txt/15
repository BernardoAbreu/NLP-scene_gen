<L>__{interior field hospital. night}
<A>__{inman sits on the ground beside oakley's cot. around them, the wounded are certainly dying, makeshift care, oil lights, groans.}
<C>__{oakley}
<D>__{i'd like to hear some music while i go.}
<L>__{exterior confederate lines. night}
<A>__{inman walks around the campfires. he hears some fiddle music. it's stobrod. stobrod sees inman. inman stares, his expression an instruction, the turns and walks away.}
<L>__{interior field hospital. night}
<A>__{stobrod stands over oakley. consults with inman.}
<C>__{stobrod}
<D>__{what about bonaparte's retreat? that's one i play.}
<C>__{oakley}
<D>__{play me something sweet. like a girl's waiting for me.}
<A>__{stobrod looks at inman, confused.}
<C>__{oakley}
<D>__{play me something like there's nothing to fear from a merciful lord.}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(to stobrod)}
<D>__{you heard him.}
<C>__{stobrod}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{i only know a couple of tunes.}
<C>__{oakley}
<D>__{like when you're thirsty up at bishop's creek and the water is so cool.}
<A>__{inman glares at stobrod. and stobrod starts to play. hesitant, then with gathering confidence, improvising, increasingly expansive, as if he's as surprised as everyone else. oakley's lips move. a whisper. inman leans in.}
<C>__{oakley}
<D>__{i'm reaching cold mountain before you.}
<A>__{stobrod plays. it's wrenching. oakley stills. inman abruptly puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle, stopping stobrod. the boy is dead. inman gets to his feet and walks away.}
