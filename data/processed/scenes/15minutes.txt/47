<A>__{he looks at the flowers. decides to put the case behind him for a moment.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{i will call you later.}
<A>__{he hangs up. arranges the flowers in a vase. so they look perfect. sets them on the coffee table. fills out a card, writes, "nicky, i love you. will you marry me?" he sticks the card in the flowers turns the lights down low. puts a romantic sinatra song on the stereo. moves to the liquor cabinet. pours himself a drink. he sets the ringbox on the coffee table next to the flowers. there's a knock at the door.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{coming!}
<A>__{eddie smooths his hair, unlocks the door. but the hallway is empty.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{nicky!?!?}
<A>__{no answer. eddie steps out in the hallway with the drink in his hand. walks toward the elevator. doesn't notice the shadow that passes behind him entering his apartment. eddie turns. no sign of anyone.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{nicky?!}
<A>__{he walks back toward his apartment. turns and locks the door. a blur jumps out of the shadows slamming him on the head with a gun. eddie tumbles to the floor! out cold!}
<B>__{a blurred video image}
<A>__{as it's focused on eddie handcuffed and upper body taped to a chair 20 minutes later sobered up. emil is sitting in front of him. on the coffee table alongside him are the flowers in a vase. they've ransacked the place. emil has eddie's watch, his gold shield and his money. he's smoking one of eddie's cigars and in emil's hand...is the diamond engagement ring and card. oleg, 60 minutes style, is positioned behind emil videotaping eddie. he moves to the corner of the room bringing a light back over to illuminate eddie's face.}
<C>__{emil}
<D>__{so...who's nicky?}
<C>__{eddie}

<C>__{emil }
<D>__{so tabloids don't have to do re enactments. they going to have real movie this time.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{if you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.}
<A>__{emil turns to oleg.}
<C>__{emil}
<D>__{turn it off.}
<A>__{oleg obeys. emil turns to eddie.}
<C>__{emil }
<D>__{no. we are insane. who else but crazy men would film their murders?}
<P>__{(gestures to eddie)}
<D>__{so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. but what good is money there? because once in hospital i say i not crazy. just pretended to be acquitted. we see psychiatrists. they must certify we are sane and because of your what is law called?}
<P>__{(eddie says nothing)}
<D>__{oh i got it. because of your double jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice. we come out free, rich and famous!}
<C>__{oleg}
<D>__{good idea!}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit? how fuckin' stupid are you?}
<C>__{emil}
<D>__{smarter than americans. you're fed cry baby talk shows all day long. not only will americans believe me, they'll cry for me.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{so...detective eddie flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your nicolette? maybe you can propose to her now?}
<A>__{eddie says nothing. just stares at emil. emil puffs on eddie's cigar.}
<C>__{emil }
<D>__{okay. he has nothing to say.}
<P>__{(signaling oleg)}
<D>__{start the camera!}
<C>__{oleg}
<D>__{cut!}
<A>__{emil looks at oleg.}
<C>__{oleg }
<D>__{this is my project. i say 'action.' i am the director! you are the talent. you wait for me to say 'action!'}
<A>__{emil looks at eddie as if to say, "see what i have to put up with." oleg gestures from behind the videocamera.}
<C>__{oleg }
<D>__{and...action!}
<A>__{oleg films as emil raises eddie's service revolver. eddie suddenly kicks at emil's hand, but emil pulls it away, backing out of eddie's reach.}
<C>__{emil}
<D>__{bad last moment i cut that out.}
<A>__{emil raises the pistol again pointing the gun at eddie's left temple. emil cocks the hammer, but eddie avoids the gun, ducking his head to the side of emil's arm. standing and following his head up emil's arm and pushing him over into the desk. eddie then knocks emil with the chair and emil falls off the desk and onto the floor. oleg still grips the videocamera. eddie continues around with the chair and drives oleg back across the room pinning him to the wall. eddie comes back from oleg to the gun at the same time as emil is limping for it. eddie knocks emil out of the way with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly. eddie comes up and around again at oleg who is coming at him from the wall. eddie knocks oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa. falling on top of him, rolling over and leaving oleg on the sofa. eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the gun. emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is not clear in the darkness who has the gun. oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the videocamera. eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up as oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting toward oleg managing to shoot one of the blinds off the window and one of the lampshades off the lamp. oleg crouches down with the camera and eddie starts to turn toward emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in the stomach. emil steps back, revealing the knife is buried in eddie's}
<B>__{stomach.}
<A>__{eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to the chair holding the gun. eddie can't believe he got stabbed. blood swells around his stomach. he can't be dying. this can't be happening. he looks at emil. the pain is terrible. oleg has knelt down next to eddie getting a close up. emil looks at eddie.}
<C>__{emil }
<D>__{die. die.}
<A>__{emil looks around. grabs a black pillow and finishes eddie off, suffocating him.}
<B>__{blackness}
<A>__{we are moving through a tunnel pitch black, so dark all you feel is the motion. we are travelling very fast. finally, in the distance, a speck of light which fills the frame. we slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a tiny pixel on a tv screen.}
<B>__{widening}
<A>__{further out we see eddie's funeral on the evening news. it's an enormous gathering a sea of blue uniforms and dignitaries. in the upper right hand corner, superimposed over the funeral, is a picture of eddie from his id and in his nypd uniform. we see oleg's reflection on the set with the videocamera. he is filming the tv. we hear the audio from eddie's funeral.}
<C>__{newscaster }
<D>__{..detective flemming was one of the most decorated nypd detectives in the history of new york. he made several thousand arrests during his career, including the famed stephen geller case. beloved by the community in which he served. his partner eulogized him...}
<A>__{leon is at the mic.}
<C>__{leon }
<D>__{...eddie was my mentor, my best friend and my partner...he taught me the meaning of the word 'cop.' he was a man in every sense of the word. i will miss him...}
<P>__{(choking on tears)}
<D>__{sleep well, brother.}
<A>__{leon begins to sing "amazing grace." oleg pans from the tv and focuses it on a lightbulb. hands enter the frame carefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray. a long hypodermic needle slides into the ashtray the plunger is pulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid. gingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb. again, the plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a table...next to a can of gasoline. videocamera zooms out revealing...emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this.}
