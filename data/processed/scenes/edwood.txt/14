<A>__{the old guy is proudly showing ed stock footage on a moviola. the footage is totally random: giant explosions, buffalos stampeding, tanks, an octopus swimming, etc. ed is dazzled.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{this is fantastic! what are you gonna do with it all?}
<C>__{old crusty man}
<D>__{eh, probably file it away and never see it again.}
<C>__{ed}

<P>__{(getting inspired)}
<D>__{see, the story opens with these mysterious explosions. nobody knows what's causing them, but it's upsetting all the buffalo. so the military is called in to solve the mystery.}
<C>__{old crusty man}
<D>__{ya forgot the octopus.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{no, i'm saving that for the big underwater climax!}
<A>__{the old guy cackles.}
