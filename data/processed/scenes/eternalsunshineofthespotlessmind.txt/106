<D>__{naomi. voice over on the couch. dark. quiet. i wondered if i had made a terrible mistake. i almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. i thought i could take it back, erase it, explain i had momentarily lost my mind. then i told myself we weren't happy. that was the truth. that what we were was safe. it was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. i thought about clementine and the spark when i was with her, but then i thought what you and i had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. but i wanted fun. i saw other people having fun and i wanted it. then i thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; i'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then i thought maybe not, maybe not. and then i thought, as i always do at this point in my argument, about dying.}
