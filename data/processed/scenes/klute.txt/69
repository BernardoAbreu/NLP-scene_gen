<C>__{frank}
<D>__{bree hi come in, come in.}
<A>__{the point of this one brief shot bree's face in the instant after frank has spoken and before she enters, with klute following. her half second of hesitation. this is someone who gets to her somehow probably always will. wider ligourin's apt: threeshot day the apartment is as expected but not overdone; a certain small amount of someone lives here litter. a few, large but not very good, abstractions on the walls. there is a large table covered over with photographs and mock ups of magazine pages, a felt board or easel with lettering samples frank's props really.}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well bree, maybe you'd rather }
<A>__{he gestures gently to indicate outside. she nods once. he escorts her in that direction, out the door, closing it behind them.}
