<L>__{interior department store night (first light)}
<A>__{cole's light reveals a spider web just inside the store. a large spider tries to hide from the light. cole reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and puts it into one of his specimen tubes. then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store. there's nothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.}
<L>__{exterior department store dawn}
<A>__{as cole comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the building. cole stops, squints into the light through his visor. cole's pov: spray painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled logo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle. over it is written, "we did it!" cole looks up. cole's pov: high up on a building across the street, a lion patrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.}
