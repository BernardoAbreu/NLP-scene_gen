<L>__{interior te's study day}
<A>__{yu gently lays the sword, still in its sheath, in jen's hands.}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{it's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{the handle is heavy. and the blade is no ordinary metal. still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. you're just not used to handling it.}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{but i have had much practice. as a child in the west, a platoon lived with us. they'd let me play with their weapons. the scabbard is so beautiful.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{beautiful but dangerous. once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire. it's 400 years old.}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{exquisite! you said it belongs to...}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{my friend li mu bai. he's given it to sir te as a gift.}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{li mu bai! the famous warrior? why would he give his sword to sir te?}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{you're too young to understand.}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{you're a sword fighter too?}
<A>__{yu yanks the sword out of the sheath. an eerie sound resonates within the study. jen is even more impressed.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{yes, i am. but i prefer the machete. certain moves, however, call for a sword.}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{yu puts the sword back in the case.}
<C>__{jen}
<P>__{(longingly)}
<D>__{it must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{i've read all about people like you. roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{but you're just like the characters in the stories.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{sure. no place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea infested beds... they tell you all about that in those books?}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{you know what i mean. i'm getting married soon, but i haven't lived the life i want.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{so i heard. congratulations. it's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{you're not married, are you?}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{no! you couldn't roam around freely if you were.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{you're probably right.}
<A>__{yu studies jen. the room falls silent for a moment.}
