<L>__{interior elementary school classroom moments later}
<A>__{the classroom is filled with screaming, running children. mrs. boswell enters the classroom with andrea and immediately calls out to tommy, a tough seven year old kid who swings a whiffle bat at lenny, now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid.}
<C>__{mrs. boswell}
<D>__{tommy! leave lenny alone! don't make me send you to mr. voytek's office!}
<A>__{evan is surprised to see his mother enter with mrs. boswell, but continues playing with kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, sweet looking girl. mrs. boswell leads andrea over to the teacher's desk.}
<C>__{mrs. boswell}
<D>__{i was going to show this to the principal, but i wanted to talk to you first.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{mrs. boswell}
<D>__{yesterday i had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...}
<A>__{mrs. boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls out a drawing. andrea turns to stone when she sees it.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{i don't understand... evan did this?}
<A>__{the drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while standing on a heap of dead bodies. it's extremely sophisticated for a seven year old. some of the corpses have been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically correct. andrea sees evan playing with lenny, harmless as a bunny, and struggles to control her concern.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{thank you for showing it to me first. i will... i will take care of it. can i have the picture?}
<C>__{mrs. boswell}
<D>__{of course. there is one more thing, mrs. treborn. and i feel bad for mentioning it...}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mrs. boswell}
<D>__{when i asked evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.}
<A>__{andrea is visibly shaken now.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{i have to go.}
