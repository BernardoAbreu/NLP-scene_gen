<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{a mass of swarming, jubilant people. the voices are high and loud and there's not a hand without a champagne glass. couples lean into one another intimately, dancing gaily between the tables, toasting strangers without hesitation.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(yelling to be heard)}
<D>__{all right, everyone. this is it. let's hear it. ten. nine ...}
<A>__{gradually, the entire room joins the chant.}
<D>__{frank everyone eight. seven. six. five. four. three. two! one! happy new year!}
<A>__{there is a blizzard of confetti as people scramble to find that certain someone to kiss in the new year. in this moment, jack, frank and susie find themselves oddly removed from the frantic cheer below them, their presence suddenly unnecessary, forgotten. finally, susie walks over to frank and gives him a kiss, then goes to jack. they hesitate, then kiss lightly, pulling away and glancing awkwardly into each other's eyes. frank sounds the first chord of "auld lang syne" and susie looks away from jack and returns to her place on the stage. as she begins to sing, the others in the room, all intimate friends for one brief moment, begin to sing with her.}
<D>__{susie everyone lest old acquaintances be forgot ...}
<A>__{as the voices slowly fade, they are joined by the sound of the ocean until the ocean is all we hear and we see:}
