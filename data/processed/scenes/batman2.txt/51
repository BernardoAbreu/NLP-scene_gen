<L>__{interior penguin's lair a moment later night}
<A>__{our visitor selina kyle enters the penguin pool room. her teeth begin to chatter. the big bay windows have been thrown open, and snow is blowing in from outside. it's freezing in here. she sees the penguin wearing a thin dressing gown and an apron outfitted with seed pouches scattering birdseed on the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the cold. he turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the back of selina's hand.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{ah, miss kyle! at last we meet.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{at last we meet. pigeons?}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{yes, they're common birds dirty, stupid, unattractive but they're very obedient, and they do crap on people's heads. may i?}
<A>__{she extends a shopping bag. the penguin removes a parcel and unwraps it, revealing the raven statuette. he sets it on a nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and beams at selina.}
<C>__{penguin }
<D>__{i see your reputation was not exaggerated.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{i've located the others. all but one.}
<P>__{(shivering)}
<D>__{i'm surprised you don't catch pneumonia !}
<A>__{with an apologetic smile, the penguin pulls the windows shut.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{my normal body temperature is ninety two degrees. germs find me inhospitable.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{i see why they call you the penguin.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{they may call me that...but rarely more than once. champagne?}
<A>__{she nods. he pours two glasses, hands one to selina, raises a toast.}
<C>__{penguin }
<D>__{my dear. here's to the second biggest crime in the history of gotham city.}
