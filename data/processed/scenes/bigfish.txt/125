<L>__{exterior outside stage night}
<A>__{a thousand chinese soldiers sit, bored, watching the equivalent of a u.s.o. show. a chinese ventriloquist is on stage with his communist puppet. we have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every act is fundamentally the same. the emcee comes on to usher him off the stage before he's finished. the ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in. the emcee makes a "shoot him in the neck" motion to one of the armed guards off stage.}
