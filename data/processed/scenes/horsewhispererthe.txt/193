<L>__{exterior barn dance, hank's ranch dusk}
<A>__{cars and pick up trucks haphazardly parked along a dirt road... smoking open grill barbecues. ranchers and families move about the ranch, sit and eat at picnic tables with gingham tablecloths... some teenagers hanging around the corral, talking. diane and some other women, eating and talking... frank with a group of men, drinking beer, telling stories. a band has been set up by the barn. people are dancing under the harvest moon. grace is dancing with joe... tom is dancing with a local woman... annie with a rancher... everyone is having a good time... robert is enjoying a smoke with some men. he looks over to the dance floor and smiles when he sees grace and joe. joe and the rancher trade place... joe dances with annie, the rancher with grace... but tom sees his chance and switches with the rancher so that he can dance with grace... she is thrilled and he guides her effortlessly across the floor. joe and annie are interrupted by another couple. joe switches partners, but annie smiles and excuses herself she wants to rest. robert continues talking with some of the men. he puts out his smoke and looks over to the dance floor. he sees grace now dancing with tom... his eyes search for annie. he moves away from the men until he sees, from a distance; annie, sitting by herself, amidst the crowd... no one would notice her unless they were looking for her... but robert does and what he sees is annie looking at grace and tom... then, only looking at tom... smiling to herself gently... watching his every move. suddenly, she rises and exits out of the barn to get some air.}
