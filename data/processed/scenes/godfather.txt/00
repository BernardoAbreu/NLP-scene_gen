<A>__{the paramount logo is presented austerely over a black background. there is a moment's hesitation, and then the simple words in white lettering:}
<B>__{the godfather}
<A>__{while this remains, we hear: "i believe in america." suddenly we are watching in close view, amerigo bonasera, a man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great emotion.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{america has made my fortune.}
<A>__{as he speaks, the view imperceptibly begins to loosen.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{i raised my daughter in the american fashion; i gave her freedom, but taught her never to dishonor her family. she found a boy friend, not an italian. she went to the movies with him, stayed out late. two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend. they made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her. she resisted; she kept her honor. so they beat her like an animal. when i went to the hospital her nose was broken, her jaw was shattered and held together by wire, and she could not even weep because of the pain.}
<A>__{he can barely speak; he is weeping now.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{i went to the police like a good american. these two boys were arrested and brought to trial. the judge sentenced them to three years in prison, and suspended the sentence. suspended sentence! they went free that very day. i stood in the courtroom like a fool, and those bastards, they smiled at me. then i said to my wife, for justice, we must go to the godfather.}
<A>__{by now, the view is full, and we see don corleone's office in his home. the blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with patterned shadows. we are watching bonasera over the shoulder of don corleone. tom hagen sits near a small table, examining some paperwork, and sonny corleone stands impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a glass of wine. we can hear music, and the laughter and voices of many people outside.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help. i don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{what do you want of me? i will give you anything you want, but do what i ask!}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{and what is that bonasera?}
<A>__{bonasera whispers into the don's ear.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{no. you ask for too much.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{i ask for justice.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{the court gave you justice.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{an eye for an eye!}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{but your daughter is still alive.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{then make them suffer as she suffers. how much shall i pay you.}
<A>__{both hagen and sonny react.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{you never think to protect yourself with real friends. you think it's enough to be an american. all right, the police protects you, there are courts of law, so you don't need a friend like me. but now you come to me and say don corleone, you must give me justice. and you don't ask in respect or friendship. and you don't think to call me godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{america has been good to me...}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, bonasera. but if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you...}
<A>__{slowly, bonasera bows his head and murmurs.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{be my friend.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{good. from me you'll get justice.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{godfather.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{some day, and that day may never come, i would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.}
