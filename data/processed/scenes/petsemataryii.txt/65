<D>__{sleep tight, darling. i will be with you soon.}
<A>__{it's a woman's voice. a familiar one. now we hear the rhythmic creak of a rocking chair. and with it comes the voice again, humming a haunting lullaby. wide eyed, geoff turns his head toward the source... a woman's nondescript form is seated in the rocking chair across the room. rocking forward, her face passes into a swath of moonlight... it's renee. with the rock of the chair, her face recedes back into the shadows. her soothing hum remains. and again, her face passes into the swath of light. and again it retreats. geoff raises his hand, reaching out for her. renee's hand rises from the shadows, reaching for him. but suddenly, the room begins to stretch. the rocking chair and the bed seem distanced like polar extremes, mother and son hopelessly separated by forces beyond their control. lightning flashes in the bedside window. renee is falling farther and farther away.}

<A>__{bolts up from his pillow. awake now, face wet with perspiration. it was a nightmare. except, if it was a nightmare, why do we still hear... ...the steady creak of the rocking chair. geoff slowly turns his head once again, repeating the actions of his dreams. in the shadows, the chair is still rocking. as it comes forward into the moonlight, we see zowie, curled up asleep on the seat of the chair. tiger is not on the bed anymore. she's up on top of the bookcase now, wide awake, eyes fixed on the dog. she hisses. geoff stares at the rocking chair, petrified.}
