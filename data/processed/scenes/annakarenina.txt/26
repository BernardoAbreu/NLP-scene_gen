<L>__{interior l'angleterre restaurant, moscow }
<C>__{night}
<A>__{oblonsky and levin preside over the debris of three dozen oysters, with champagne in a bucket to hand. oblonsky is in a maudlin mood, afloat on champagne.}
<C>__{oblonsky}
<D>__{it's so unfair. you marry for love, you're a good husband. children arrive. years depart. and all of a sudden your wife is tired, her hair is thin, her body . . . while you yourself still have your . . . vigour . . . and you find yourself distracted by a pretty woman . . .}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{forgive me, but i find that incomprehen sible . . . as though i'd leave this restaurant and steal a roll from a baker's shop.}
<C>__{oblonsky}
<D>__{well, you know, a freshly baked roll . . .}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{but i'm talking about love, and you're talk ing about . . . your appetite.}
<C>__{oblonsky}
<D>__{easily confused. now look, do you know count vronsky?}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{who? no. why?}
<C>__{oblonsky}
<D>__{he's your rival. he turned up from st. petersburg after you left.}
<C>__{levin}
<P>__{(aghast)}
<D>__{who is he?}
<C>__{oblonsky}
<P>__{(changing tack)}
<D>__{you don't have to worry about him. he's one of those rich, good looking cavalry offi cers who've got nothing to do but make love to pretty women . . .}
<A>__{a waiter arrives to remove the oyster shells, while an elderly waiter places a bowl of soup in front of levin and a lobster in front of oblonsky.}
<C>__{oblonsky }
<D>__{cabbage soup?}
<C>__{elderly waiter}
<D>__{potage aux choux a la russe, as the gentle man ordered.}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{it's what i wanted.}
<A>__{oblonsky laughs. the waiter departs.}
<C>__{levin }
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{understand that for me, tonight is a ques tion of life and death.}
<C>__{oblonsky}
<D>__{oh, kostya! kitty would be mad to refuse you. and dolly is on your side, you know. she says her sister kitty was always meant to be your wife and will be.}
<A>__{levin jumps up in elation, collects himself, and sits.}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{dolly said that? i've always thought your dolly's a gem.}
<C>__{oblonsky}
<D>__{oh, she is, she is . . .}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{i loved her to distraction.}
