<L>__{interior 3rd floor day}
<A>__{elevator doors open. the ups man throws the package out onto the floor and starts kicking it down the hall like a soccer player. with one last big kick the parcel lands in front of apartment 3b. he picks it up and knocks on the door. we hear a small dog barking.}
<C>__{gruff man }
<D>__{shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!}
<A>__{an angry, burly man pokes his nose hairs out the chained door.}
<C>__{gruff man}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{ups man}
<D>__{ups, sir. and how are you this afternoon? alrighty then!}
<A>__{the man grumpily unchains the door. he's a big guy 6'5", 250, and 50 of that is chest hair. a small shiatsu stands beside him.}
<C>__{ups man}
<D>__{i have a package for you.}
<A>__{the ups guy thrusts the package toward the man. we can clearly hear broken glass inside. the man takes the package.}
<C>__{gruff man}
<D>__{it sounds broken.}
<C>__{ups man}
<D>__{most likely sir! i bet it was something nice though! now... i haver an insurance form. if you'll just sign here, here, and here, and initial here, and print your name here, we'll get the rest of the forms out to you as soon as we can.}
<A>__{the man begrudgingly begins to fill out the form. the dog wags his tail and whines. we can see that he likes the ups guy.}
<C>__{ups man}
<D>__{that's a lovely dog you have. do you mind if i pet him, sir?}
<C>__{gruff man}
<P>__{(mumbles)}

<C>__{gruff man}
<P>__{(under breath)}
