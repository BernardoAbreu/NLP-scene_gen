<D>__{and we emerge in the master bedroom.}
<A>__{he checks his watch. meg looks around, studying the dimensions of the room. she looks at the far wall, the one that borders the house next door. she looks at the wall that corners it, opposite the window wall. she takes two steps back from it.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{something's weird.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?}
<A>__{she points to the far end of the wall, near the entrance to the closet. there is a mirrored door that leads to the closet, and a mirror on the wall alongside it. if you look closely, you'll see that the mirrors are raked slightly toward one another, which causes an optical illusion in which the corner of the room appears much closer to the door than it is.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i was waiting to see if you'd notice! on caravan, no one from our office had the slightest idea.}
<A>__{he pushes on the top of the mirror on the wall. it makes a faint click, then glides open a few inches off the wall. he pulls it toward him, opens it all the way, a hundred eighty degrees, and it fastens magnetically to the back of the closed door. there is smooth wall behind it, but if you look closely, there is a faint vertical crack in the wall. meg looks at him what in the world? even pushes again, twice this time, first at the top, then at the bottom, and the smooth wall clicks ajar. he pulls it wide open. meg and lydia step forward, fascinated.}
