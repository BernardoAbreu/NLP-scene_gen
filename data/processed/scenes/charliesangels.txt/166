<L>__{interior tower office day}
<A>__{natalie keeps checking the shelves, looking for a secret switch.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i did. i do. i mean, thank you for calling.}
<L>__{intercut}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i'm not an insecure person or anything, and i've really enjoyed the very brief time we have spent together.}
<A>__{two goons race up the stairs into the office. natalie turns to face them.}
<C>__{pete }
<D>__{i'm just wondering if it's something i said or did that's making this whole thing so weird between us.}
<A>__{the goons approach.}
<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{can you hold on a sec?}
<A>__{hitting mute, natalie kicks the chair behind her and dives under the desk. she comes up on the other side with a surge suppressor, electric cords attached. she backhands it into the goons, who jerk and twitch as electricity shoots through their bodies.}
<C>__{natalie }
<P>__{(un muting)}
<D>__{one more sec.}
<A>__{she re mutes. with a roundhouse kick, she flattens one of the goons, whacks the other with the cell phone. the first goon charges at her, but she sidesteps at the last moment, leaving goon one to hit goon two. both men topple through the open window, falling. yikes.}
<C>__{natalie }
<P>__{(un muting)}
<D>__{sorry about that.}
<A>__{charlie's angels 8 18 99}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{listen, is this a bad time?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{no. not at all.}
<A>__{she starts searching again for the switch.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you just sound distracted.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{you know, work this week has been really busy. it's been hard to focus.}
<A>__{behind natalie, vivian wu reaches the top of the stairs. she moves stealthily. natalie has no idea she's there.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{see, the thing is, i'm not a full time waitress. i should have been more up front about that, it's just...}
<A>__{at the last moment, natalie catches a moving reflection in a shiny trophy. turns to find vivian wu swinging an antique chair at her head. she ducks. the chair shatters the display case. scrambling to get away, natalie drops the phone.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{natalie, what was that?}
<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(yelling to phone)}
<D>__{everything's fine!}
<C>__{vivian wu}
<D>__{hate to disagree.}
<A>__{vivian upends the desk, nearly crushing natalie. vivian jumps on top, ready to kick the shit out of our angel. as we probably suspected, vivian wu is one hell of a martial artist. fortunately, so is natalie. in their first series of blows, vivian seems to have the upper hand, but natalie rallies hard. vivian surprises her with a floor sweeping kick, knocking her down. vivian grabs the phone off the floor.}
<C>__{vivian wu }
<D>__{is this the famous charlie?}
<A>__{charlie's angels 8 18 99}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{no, it's pete.}
<A>__{vivian looks at the phone. who the fuck cares? she throws the phone out the open window. getting up, natalie stares her down, incredulity building to rage.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{you bitch! i like that guy.}
<A>__{mocking, vivian wipes away a tear. natalie lets forth a typhoon of fury, a full out mortal kombat. vivian is thrown back against the bookcase, where she knocks over a candlestick. that's the trigger for the bookcases to begin sinking into the floor. circling around the room, each set of shelves drops to a different level, forming steps that lead to the upstairs room. as natalie and vivian continue to fight, bosley sticks his head down from above, watching the brawl. natalie is kicking ass.}
<C>__{natalie }
<P>__{(to vivian)}
<D>__{do you have any idea how difficult it is to find a quality man in los angeles?}
<A>__{she slams vivian into the wall. grabs her again, hands around her head.}
<C>__{vivian wu}
<D>__{to be honest?}
<A>__{vivian suddenly leans forward and kisses her, right on the lips.}
<C>__{vivian wu }
<D>__{i don't care.}
<A>__{natalie is surprised for a moment, which gives vivian the chance to swing at her. she misses.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i can handle villainy. i can even handle super villainy.}
<P>__{(vivian swings and misses again)}
<D>__{but what you did is just wrong.}
<A>__{charlie's angels 8 18 99 she head butts vivian, knocking her out cold. she throws the limp body on the floor. a beat, then natalie looks up to see bosley.}
<C>__{natalie }
<P>__{(suddenly chipper)}
<D>__{hi, bos!}
<A>__{he waves.}
