<L>__{interior schindler's office same time day}
<A>__{an elegant place setting for one. meat, vegetables, glass of wine, all untouched. schindler leafing through pages of a report stern has prepared for him.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i could try to read this or i could eat my lunch while it's till hot. we're doing well?}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{better this month than last?}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{any reason to think next month will be worse?}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{the war could end.}
<A>__{no chance of that. satisfied, schindler returns the report to his accountant and starts to eat. stern knows he is excused, but looks like he wants to say something more; he just doesn't know how to say it.}
<C>__{schindler}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{stern}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{there's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.}
<A>__{schindler gives his accountant a long suffering look.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{he asks every day. it'll just take a minute. he's very grateful.}
<A>__{schindler's silence says, is this really necessary? stern pretends it's a tacit okay, goes to the door and pokes his head out.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{mr. lowenstein?}
<A>__{an old man with one arm appears in the doorway and schindler glances to the ceiling, to heaven. as the man slowly makes his way into the room, schindler sees the bruises on his face. and when he speaks, only half his mouth moves; the other half is paralyzed.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{i want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you're welcome, i'm sure you're doing a great job.}
<A>__{schindler shakes the man's hand perfunctorily and tells stern with a look, okay, that's enough, get him out of here.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{the ss beat me up. they would have killed me, but i'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{that's great.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{i work hard for you. i will continue to work hard for you.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{that's great, thanks.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{god bless you, sir.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{yeah, okay.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{you're a good man.}
<A>__{schindler is dying, and telling stern with his eyes, get this guy out of here. stern takes the man's arm.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{okay, mr. lowenstein.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{he saved my life.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{yes, he did.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{god bless him.}
<C>__{stern}
