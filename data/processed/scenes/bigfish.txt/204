<A>__{will flips to a new page. the list keeps getting longer. he smiles, remembering something. on his fourth page, he looks up at his motionless father. a beat, then we slowly}

<L>__{interior hospital room pre dawn}
<A>__{it's very early morning, and the first blue light of day is glowing through the vertical blinds. still in his chair, will wakes up a bit at a time. the notepad is on his lap, the pen in his hand. he cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong. what woke him up? he looks to his right. holds his gaze for a breath.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{his father is awake, silently gasping for breath. his eyes are open, scared and confused.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{dad! do you want me to get a nurse?}
<A>__{edward shakes his head unambiguously. will already has his finger on the orange "nurse call" button, but doesn't push it.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what can i do? can i help? can i get you something? water?}
<A>__{edward nods. will pours a glass from the pitcher on the nightstand. he holds it to his father's lips, but edward won't drink. he pushes it away. he wanted something else.}

<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{the river.}
<C>__{will}

<A>__{on will, realizing...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you mean what you saw in the eye?}
<A>__{edward nods. yes, that's what he was trying to say. a long beat.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i don't know that story, dad. you never told me that one.}
<A>__{will pushes his fingers under his father's heavy hand, and holds it. there's nothing else to do. edward looks around, confused and increasingly scared. he sees the end approaching, but doesn't know exactly what's coming. without the story, he's lost. fighting the urge to panic }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i can try, dad. if you help. just tell me how it starts.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{like this.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{okay. okay.}
<A>__{will looks around the room, increasingly desperate. he looks to the nurse call button. he really wants to press it. on edward, waiting for will to begin.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{okay. it's morning, and you and i are in the hospital. i'd fallen asleep in the chair. i wake up and i see you, and...}
