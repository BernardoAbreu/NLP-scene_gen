<L>__{interior space port day}
<A>__{passengers are boarding a commercial spacecraft. in addition to the stewardesses checking their tickets, there are two plainclothes men checking every passenger. they carry some kind of small, portable electronic device that they shine in the face of each passenger going through. (it gives off a blue beam and hums.) the passengers are a diverse group businessmen, officials, government people, etc. there is also a large tour group consisting of a predominately middle aged and determinedly jolly crowd, many of them carrying duty free bags. they are being marshaled by an harassed tour organizer, who is carrying aloft a hand painted sign... "martian tour group". the last of the passengers board the spacecraft. the chief plainclothes man nods to an official and the door begins to close.}
<D>__{plainclothes man #1 if he had to travel to mars with that bunch, i'd be sorry for him. plainclothes man #2 we couldn't have missed him? plainclothes man #1 no way. let's get a coffee before the next shuttle.}
