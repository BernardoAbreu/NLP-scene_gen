<L>__{intercut always with:}
<A>__{train interior day gandhi's face in the window, he and ba standing, looking out together, neither speaking. gandhi writing in the cramped chaos of the third class coaches. gandhi sweeping part of the carriage, making disgruntled passengers move as he tries to bring some cleanliness to their surroundings. river vista exterior day a broad alluvial plain, the river threading through it, purple and gold in the rising sun. the camera races with the train along the river's edge, the reflected sun glimmering on the windows. river bank exterior day the sun is high and the train is stopped by the river. people have come out of the coaches to cool their heads with the touch of water, to stretch their legs. we see an english clergyman from the second class coaches, dipping a toe cautiously into the water, children of some british enlisted soldiers wading, splashing, faces alight with fun. and, farther along, the parasols of one or two of the english first class passengers, a woman dousing her neck delicately with perfume. a british officer, tunic unbuttoned, smoking a long cigar as he walks along in a few inches of water, his trousers rolled up, his shoes off. across the river down from the third class coaches a small group of indian women is squatted by the river's edge, washing clothes. some carry infants on their backs. some small children stand near them. their ritual of washing goes on, but they are all watching the passengers of the train. gandhi stands with ba and charlie among the third class passengers. ba cools her face with water. charlie, his trousers rolled up, plays a tentative splashing game with a skinny little indian boy. gandhi is holding a large white head cloth which he is soaking in the water, but his eyes have been arrested by the sight of the women across the river. and now we see the women closely from his point of view, the camera panning slowly along them. their bodies are skin and bone. the clothes they wear, which looked normal from the distance, are rags literally, shredded rages, one hung on another. the children are hollow eyed and gaunt, staring listlessly at the train. one boy, with a stump for an arm, aimlessly pushes at the flies that buzz around him. gandhi stands erect, lost now in the revelation of their poverty. his eyes hold on one woman at the river bank. though her frail face is almost skeletal, it is beautiful but scarred by a severe rash down her cheek and neck. the cloth she is washing is a shredded piece of muslin. her eyes have met gandhi's as he watches her. gandhi stares for a moment, a long beat. then he slowly moves his arm out into the water and, without taking his eyes from her, releases the head cloth he has been rinsing. it floats along on the water down toward the woman. she looks from gandhi to it with sudden excitement, a sense of incredulity. as the cloth nears her, she rises and moves almost greedily out into the water to take it. her hands snatch at it quickly. then she stands, looking at gandhi. the infant on her back shifts, its huge hollow eyes reacting to the movement. gandhi smiles slowly, tilting his head just slightly to her. and now that she has possession of the cloth, her manner calms again. and she looks back at him, and her lips almost part with a tiny smile of thanks. hold gandhi, staring at her, fighting the pain in his eyes... train exterior night threading like a lighted necklace across the darkness of a vast plain. train in hills exterior day climbing green hills a totally different terrain and again we intercut, this time the train climbing: a boy and buffalo running a huge, crude grinding wheel, train climbing; farmers in terraced fields, train climbing faster and faster... until suddenly with a hoot of the whistle and the screech of brakes it stops! train exterior day gandhi is leaning out of a window in a third class coach. ahead of him other passengers are looking too; some have jumped down. gandhi and charlie jump down too. as they come clear they can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has been derailed ahead of them. a small troop of cavalry are coming slowly along the line of gandhi's train toward them. featuring the cavalry. they are british and their troop leader is viciously angry.}
<C>__{troop leader}
<D>__{clear the way! get out of the way!}
<A>__{he is swinging his sword, not lethally, but threateningly at the indian passengers from the train. his british ncos are equally angry and deliberately ride close to the passengers, forcing them back against the train. gandhi and charlie step back. and as the troop goes past we see from their point of view a group of indian bearers, trotting in the middle of the horsemen, carrying two litters covered, each hanging by straps from a long pole and each bearing a badly wounded british soldier; one appears to be dead. outskirts of village exterior day the shadow of a train moves slowly along the ground, a sense of tension and foreboding. we hear the engine chugging slowly. the camera lifts. gandhi and charlie stand at a window, staring out grimly. other passengers are looking off too. ba is seated, staring straight ahead, her face taut, deliberately not seeing what the others are seeing. gallows exterior day their point of view: on a hill across from the railroad track part of a prison wall is visible. in front of it a thick pole is straddled across two others. from this crude gallows two indian men hang by the neck. one is in turban and dhoti, the other in a tunic. the sound of the train stopping. village exterior day close shot. incense rising in shot. the camera pulls back and back. the incense is burning in a bowl sitting before gandhi on a make shift platform set in the little valley between the train line and the little hill where the indian men have been hanged. a small crowd sits in a crescent before him, ba and charlie are bent in prayer on the platform behind him. when the camera comes to rest, the edge of the gallows and a portion of one of the hanged men is in the frame. we know we are looking from someone's point of view near the prison wall. finally, gandhi lifts his head.}

<D>__{it is not my law, it is the law of creation. we reap what we sow. out there in the fields and in our hearts. violence sows hatred, and the will to revenge. in them. and in us.}
<A>__{he looks up. hillside his point of view the troop leader, on horseback, is on the hill beside the gallows. the first view of gandhi on the platform was his. some of his troops are lined up beside him. he stares down at gandhi coldly. patel's swimming pool exterior day patel lounges in the water on his back, supported by a large air pillow. nehru sits at the side of the pool in a swimming suit, his feet dangling in the water. jinnah sits under an umbrella in an elegant white suit, being served tea by one of three or four servants around. patel spews a fountain of water.}
