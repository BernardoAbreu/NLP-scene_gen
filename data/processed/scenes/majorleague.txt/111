<L>__{interior rachel phelps' office day}
<A>__{rachel is looking out at the empty stadium. there's a knock at the door.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{the door is opened by a male secretary and in steps lou brown.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{hello, lou, what can i do for ya?}
<A>__{lou puts a folded piece of paper on her desk.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i wanted to hand in my resignation before you had a chance to fire me.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i know what you been tryin' to do with this team. after the season, i want no part of it.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{well, i knew i could count on charlie to tell somebody. i was just afraid he might take too long.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{why would you want him to tell somebody?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{so you'd tell the team, hopefully getting them mad enough to knock themselves out trying to prove they belonged in this league. i think it worked.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{you tryin' to make me believe you wanted us to win all along?}
<A>__{rachel nods.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{bullshit. what about the plane, the bus, the bad hotels...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{we were broke. we couldn't afford anything better. donald left the team nearly bankrupt. if we'd had another losing season, i would have had to sell the team. i knew we couldn't win with the team we had, so i decided to bring in new players and see how they'd do with the proper motivation. there was never any offer from miami. i made it all up.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{why should i believe any of this? now that we're winnin' it's easy for you to jump on the bandwagon.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{if i'd really wanted you to lose, all i had to do was send the best players back to the minors. but i didn't, did i?}
<A>__{brown has no comeback for this. he knows now that she's telling the truth.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you think this was all an accident? i personally scouted every member of this team, except hayes, of course. he was a surprise. they all had flaws which concealed their real talent, or i wouldn't have been able to get them. but i knew if anyone could straighten them out, you could. and if you tell them any of this, i will fire you.}
<A>__{brown can only shake his head at this whole thing.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i love this team, lou. go get 'em tonight.}
<A>__{the two shake hands. brown looks at rachel a beat, still looking for some sign of duplicity. finally he gives her a grudging smile of respect.}
