<B>__{corridor}
<A>__{baron shuts door and pauses. in front of him is the door of the woman he loves. down beyond is his own empty room. in his pockets nothing. in his closeup he makes the audience feel his problem with him. this man who has lived and whistled and love through the play becomes a tragic, lonely, harrassed figure. the baron has broken. his fists dig into his eyes he brushes his hair back. over this comes with almost an impertinence, a tiny whistle. he looks up and away down the corridor. the figure of flaemmchen stands there, a small black bag in her hand. the baron pulls himself together and smiles characteristically. he walks down the corridor.}

<D>__{and baron, thanks so much for everything.}
<A>__{they both go into their respective rooms. here are our two gay young characters. the gay, fresh flaemmchen and the debonair baron, crucified for lack of funds. both trying to smile, both trying to be light about themselves. yet, each about to involve themselves tragically for the want of a little money. flaemmchen's room flaemmchen enters her room cautiously. except for one lamp burning the room is in darkness and empty. from the adjoining door to preysing's room a thin stream of light. she puts down her bag quickly, tiptoes through the bathroom to his door. she peeps through.}
