<A>__{mike is stunned.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{but i thought you were getting ready for the season?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i never told you that.}
<A>__{as a confused mike and alex approach the scene, boys call out to mike, tap his fist. girls fawn over him. mike's become a celebrity... and he's eating it up. angle: lauren spots mike with alex.}
<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{here he comes!}
<A>__{the bras whip their heads around, get all dreamy.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{can he be any lamer? using my little brother to get to me?}

<D>__{calm down. here's what you're gonna do. you're gonna go over there and introduce yourself }
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{she won't like me, mark. i'm a loser.}
<A>__{mike grabs alex by the shoulders.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{why? because stan says so? you think stan's a winner? he's going nowhere. you're a great kid. any girl would be lucky to get your attention.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{really. and right now, there's a girl over there who's dying to meet you.}
<A>__{a determined look comes over alex.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{okay. what do i say?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{just introduce yourself. then compliment her on something she never gets complimented on. like if she has big, meaty, man hands tell her she should be a hand model.}
<P>__{(alex burps nervously)}
<D>__{and don't burp on her.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i can do that.}

<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{you came! why don't we take a walk somewhere private and play?}
<A>__{jamie and lauren rush over.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{i don't think so, sam. mark promised me a walk on the beach.}
<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{walk with me. i've got less miles on me.}
<A>__{a full blown argument breaks out between the bras. mike sees maggie sitting by the fire alone, slips out. angle: alex steps over to nicole and suddenly loses confidence. as he turns to retreat, nicole looks up }
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{alex stops, turns back around and blurts out }
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{hi, alex. i'm nicole.}
<A>__{nicole and her friends giggle.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{you don't look like a nicole.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you have big, meaty man hands. you should be a hand model.}
<A>__{the girls' jaws drop. nicole hides her hands.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{oh my god! seriously!?}
<A>__{alex rips a huge burp. the girls duck for cover.}
<C>__{girl 1}
<D>__{i think he got some on me!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{wait. i'm sorry. i'm just real nervous and i've wanted to talk to you for so long. and mark told me to compliment you on something you never get complimented on but i}
<A>__{couldn't find anything because everything's so... perfect. nicole and her friends melt.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{do you want to sit down, nicole?}
<A>__{nicole scoots over making room next to her. alex smiles. angle: mike sits down beside maggie.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{stan. why are you dating him?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{get to the point why don't you?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i'm serious. he's not a nice guy.}
<A>__{matter of fact he's a jackass.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{don't talk about him like that.}
<A>__{you don't even know him.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i know he bullies your brother.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{stan barely knows alex exists.}
<A>__{we're moving in together after graduation.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{whoa. whoa. whoa. i thought you were going to georgetown?}

<D>__{the hell you are, young lady! if you think i'm gonna let you throw your life away on some sleestack you're crazy! i forbid you to see him anymore and that's final!}
<A>__{maggie jumps up. kids all stare.}

<D>__{who do you think you are!? my father?!}
<A>__{maggie stomps over to the still bickering bras.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{don't you walk away from me, margaret sarah o'donnell!}
<A>__{maggie and the bras turn towards mike and glare. maggie heads for the parking lot.}

<D>__{he doesn't even know her name.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{he's so not into her.}
