<A>__{long stack up rack of gleaming surfboards. a hand reaches in, pulling out a board from the middle of the deck. johnny utah hefts it. sights along it. trying to look familiar with alien equipment. behind him is a whip thin}

<A>__{across the room we see pappas trying on purple wraparound sunglasses. the salespunk pulls down a wide board with a garish firebird paint scheme. like a lowrider flame job. the logo reads "dance with the universe."}
<D>__{here, you need a rhino chaser like this one to learn on. good board. i mean for a pig board.}
<A>__{utah hefts the board. scowls. hates anything he's not great at. pappas sets his purchases on a counter: the glasses, some plutonium pink shorts, t shirts, sun block. the girl behind the counter is sixteen, barely contained in a macrame bikini top and "dolphin" shorts. angelo picks up a package of sex wax from a rack. sniffs it.}
