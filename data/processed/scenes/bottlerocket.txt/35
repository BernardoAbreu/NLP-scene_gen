<D>__{armored trucks are very difficult to steal, anthony.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i know. but once you get inside you're home free.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{right.. get back to me on that one. once your plan is worth a shit.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{it's not a plan. it's just }
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{actually. if you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{true.}
<A>__{there's a car stopped in front of them. a couple of girls are standing beside it, talking to the driver. bob can't get around.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{what the fuck is this?}
<A>__{dignan leans over and holds down the horn for about five seconds. the guy in the car sticks hi s hand out the window and shoots the finger at them. dignan sounds dead serious:}

<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{hit him!}
<A>__{bob hits the gas and slams into the car. he puts his car in reverse and backs up a couple of feet. he leans forward and sees the back of the guy's car. it's all smashed up. the guy gets out of his car, shaken up, and looks at them. his expression is confused. bob punches it and flies backwards down the street. the guy stands beside his car and watches them.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{shit, bob. what the fuck did you do that for?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{he wouldn't move.}
<A>__{they go around the corner. bob shifts into first and goes.}
