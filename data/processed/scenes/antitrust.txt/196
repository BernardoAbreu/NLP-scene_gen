<D>__{i'm a mess! i got this hunan cookbook, since we're always afraid for you to eat in chinese restaurants. i've been mincing things into teeny tiny pieces all afternoon.}
<A>__{he smiles to hide his terror. is she killing him now? or just testing his reaction? or is it a sincere overture?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{great!}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{look at me! i'm gonna change.}
