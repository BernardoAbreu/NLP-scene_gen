<L>__{interior phil's lounge. day}
<A>__{phil and susie sit on the sofa, an island of calm in a sea of chaos. around them, the floor is covered with papers, clothing, empty record covers, torn open cushions and books. a broken drawer is propped against the table. a lampshade hangs crazily from its bearings, throwing strange shadows around the room. suddenly, susie gets up and kicks a cushion across the room.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{hey, well done. you found the only unbroken thing.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{why did you let her in?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{it's all part of the grieving process.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{how can she behave that way? gram's not even in the ground yet.}
<A>__{phil stares at her.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{he continues to look at her oddly.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{don't you freak out on me.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{do me a favor and get the guitar, sweetheart.}
