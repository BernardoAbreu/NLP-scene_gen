<A>__{ames hosty confronting his agitated superior, fbi agent shanklin in one of his cubicles.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{but what the note really said no one knows because his boss shanklin told hosty...}
<C>__{shanklin}
<P>__{(reading the note)}
<D>__{oswald's dead now. there's no trial. get rid of it. i don't even want this in the office. get rid of it, hosty.}
<P>__{(he gives it back to hosty)}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{hosty tore it up and flushed it down the toilet. waggoner carr, the attorney general of texas, says he had evidence from the dallas sheriff's office that oswald had been employed as an undercover informant for the fbi at a salary of $200 a month, beginning more than a year before the murder.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(in present)}
<D>__{this is just speculation, people, but what if the note was describing the assassination attempt on j.f.k.?}
<P>__{(the staff seem}
<D>__{surprised by the}
<P>__{thought)}
<D>__{come on guys, think that's the only reason to destroy it, because if it was any kind of threat, like hosty said, they would've kept it 'cause it makes their case against the "angry lone nut" stronger! remember the new orleans meeting with agent quigley the day he got busted?}
<A>__{flashback to oswald, under arrest, meeting with quigley.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{...there again quigley destroyed the notes of the meeting. i think we can raise the possibility that oswald not only was an informant but that he may well have been the original source for the telex we have dated november 17 warning of the kennedy assassination in dallas on november}
<A>__{holds up the telex. we see a close up: "urgent to all sacs from director."}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{william walter, the night clerk on duty here in the fbi office, gave me a copy of this. it went all over the country. nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule and this wasn't even mentioned in the warren report! read it, al.}
<C>__{al }
<D>__{"threat to assassinate president kennedy in dallas, texas, november 22 23. information received by the bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate president kennedy on his proposed trip to dallas, texas, etc, etc..."}
<A>__{flashback to new orleans fbi office in 1963. walter, the night clerk, receives the teletype, reads it, and runs it.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{...shortly after the assassination, walter says, the telex was removed from all the files in all cities, as an obvious embarrassment to the bureau. i believe oswald was sending information through hosty...}
<A>__{flashback to a dallas safe house in 1963. oswald, ruby, and several cubans including the bull and the indian are talking.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i have a hunch that from the get go, oswald had infiltrated this group, probably cubans or right wing extremists. he was at the book depository that day, told to be there by their handlers, either to prevent the assassination or to take part in it. they coulda told him anything, either 1) they were going to close}
<P>__{down the plotters that day, or 2)}
<D>__{they were going to fake an attack on kennedy to whip up public opinion against russia or cuba and reverse his policies it doesn't really matter what they told him, 'cause he was under orders, he was a foot soldier.}
<A>__{underneath the voice over we hear and see oswald, with a floor plan of the book depository, at the center of the group. jack ruby, bull, and the indian, two or three young cubans and a young white shooter the man in the plaid shirt described by julia ann mercer are also there.}
<C>__{oswald}
<P>__{(to the two young cubans)}
<D>__{i can get you in and up there. this is a shot out the southeast window of the sixth floor. that floor will be unoccupied between noon and one.}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{what about the elevator?}
<C>__{oswald}
<D>__{i can close it off. the only access is a stairwell.}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{we get them in as an air conditioning unit.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{no. a floor refurbishing group. got the van, the uniforms...}
<C>__{oswald}
<P>__{(his back to the screen)}
<D>__{...if we can get the motorcade to turn from main onto houston, that'll do the trick, 'cause it'll slow down to make the turn here. you can't miss.}
<P>__{(to the two young cubans)}
<D>__{he's a dead duck.}
<A>__{ruby shares a look with bull unbeknownst to oswald, and then we see the looks on the faces of jim's team.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i don't buy it, chief why would the fbi cover it up? you're talking the whole fbi here. a telex that disappears from every single fbi office in the country?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{there's a word orders.}
<A>__{back in garrison's office in 1968.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{or a cover up! jesus, bill, don't you have enough proof of the fbi's complicity now?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(to susie)}
<D>__{maybe i have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, susie. you tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the mob, the cia, fbi, and army intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people! we got leaks everywhere! we're going to trial here! what the hell do we really got? oswald, ruby, banister, ferrie are dead. shaw maybe he's an agent, i don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{shaw's our toehold, bill. i don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and i don't care. i do know he's lying through his teeth and i'm not gonna let go of him!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{so for those reasons, you're going to trial against clay shaw, chief? well, you're gonna lose! we should be investigating all our mafia leads here in new orleans carlos marcello, santos trafficante i can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the government. ruby's all mob, knows oswald, sets him up. hoffa trafficante marcello, they hire some guns and they do kennedy and maybe the government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the mob to get to castro. y'know, castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to john q. citizen. so they close the book on j.f.k. it makes sense to me.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i don't doubt their involvement, bill, but at a low level. could the mob change the parade route, bill, or eliminate the protection for the president? could the mob send oswald to russia and get him back? could the mob get the fbi, the cia, and the dallas police to make a mess of the investigation? could the mob appoint the warren commission to cover it up? could the mob wreck the autopsy? could the mob influence the national media to go to sleep? and since when has the mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? the mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude. assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules. this was a military style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with lyndon johnson waiting in the wings.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{oh, now you're saying lyndon johnson was involved? the president of the united states?}
<A>__{his voice is challenging. there's a pause. the men exchange looks and wait.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i know this, bill lyndon johnson got $1 billion for his texas friends, brown and root, to dredge cam ranh bay for the military in vietnam. that's just for openers.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{boss, are you calling the president a murderer?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{if i'm so far from the truth, why is the fbi bugging our offices? why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered? why are federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the government!}
<A>__{the others in the room groan at the reasoning. bill feels embittered, cornered.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{with a full blown conspiracy to cover it up? y'ever read your shakespeare, bill?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{julius caesar: "brutus and cassius, they too are honorable men." who killed caesar? twenty, twenty five senators. all it takes is one judas, bill a few people, on the inside, pentagon, cia...}

<D>__{this is louisiana, chief. how the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'cause your momma told you so... you're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and i for one ain't going along on this one.}

<D>__{gentlemen, i will not hear this. i value bill as much as anyone here.}
<P>__{(lou reacts angrily)}
<D>__{we all need to make room for someone else's ideas, lou, especially me. maybe oswald is what everyone says he is and i'm just plain dumb wrong.}

<C>__{lou}
<D>__{i just plain don't trust him anymore.}

<D>__{boss, then i'm afraid i can't continue working with bill.}
<A>__{tension, silence.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(pause, then quietly)}
<D>__{are you giving me an ultimatum, lou?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{well, if that's what you want to call it. i didn't ever think it would come to this. i guess i am, boss.}
