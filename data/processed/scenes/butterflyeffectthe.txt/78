<L>__{interior evan's dorm night}
<A>__{evan has now organized a pile of five journals. he selects an entry, begins reading and suddenly closes the journal. fear covers his face. he holds one of his hands up and isn't surprised to see it trembling. he opens his journal again and reads out loud.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(reading aloud)}
<D>__{the last thing i remember before the blackout was holding my hands over kayleigh's ears...}
<P>__{(his voice slowly fades)}
<D>__{i think i was more focused on her hands on mine than the mailbox across the street...}
<A>__{his own words grow reverberant, distant. furthermore, the walls behind him vibrate, slightly worse than before. flash!}
