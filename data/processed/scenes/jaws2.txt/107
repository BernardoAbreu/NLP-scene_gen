<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i love it.}

<C>__{larry}
<D>__{it's a bet. once around the marker buoy?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{that's the pin the buoy.}
<A>__{larry is confident he's got the air, but mike suddenly gybes without warning, snapping onto a new fast tack, downwind. larry and bob are caught by surprise, and lose precious moments as they fumble with their sails.}

<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yee hah!}
<A>__{he pounds with glee on the canvas trampoline as their boat moves ahead, a drumming sound.}
<B>__{underwater}

<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{uh. well. maybe you could give polo a hand going in...}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(snapping him with a rope)}
<D>__{your ass i will. besides, the wind's turning with the tide. sailing back is going to be a bitch.}
<A>__{quick cuts sailboat racing montage ropes and sails rattling through blocks. sails snapping taut, filling with wind. catamarans heeled over, racers hanging over the water, dangerously suspended in trapeze harnesses. skippers' faces, concentrating on boat handling. aerial view sailboats it's the chopper's point of view, as the harbor patrol copter from the cape flies towards the kids, following brody's previous instructions. he sees the sailboats and fly that way.}
<C>__{pilot}
<P>__{(filtered, into his mike)}

<B>__{looking up at the approaching copter}
<A>__{it approaches the sailboats, losing altitude fast, rotor blades chuffing up a storm. the pilot has his microphone to his lips, and his voice is blaring down at them.}
<C>__{pilot }
<D>__{this is the harbor patrol. return to port immediately. return to port immediately.}
<B>__{the boats}
<A>__{the kids look at each other, some coming about awkwardly, others luffing, wondering what this is all about.}

<P>__{(to mike)}
<D>__{your dad must be really pissed.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we better go back in.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{it's not going to be easy.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we're fighting wind and current. i though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{putz that won't be for hours.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i was counting on hours.}
<C>__{chopper }
<D>__{return to port.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we're trying, we're trying.}
<A>__{he waves acknowledgement, and puts about. the others take their cue from him, and set a rough course back, but without much success.}

<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{heading back?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{might as well.}
<B>__{angle on the three sloops}

<D>__{coming about, then.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{are we going back?}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{going to try. lighthouse, everybody...}
<A>__{she puts about, the three of them start back towards the lighthouse, not making much headway. doug's inflatable is the slowest, and he is now, by virtue of his position, at the head of the line beating back towards the island. doug's boat the others in the b.g.}

<D>__{make way for the carrier enterprise!}
