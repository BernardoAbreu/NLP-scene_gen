<L>__{int: lilly's apartment, childs bedroom continuing}
<A>__{lilly approaches a room and we see inside it. it is empty apart from a stripped bed and some boxes. lilly flips the lid on one of the boxes. she picks up a toy; a pink fairy princess with wings, the paint on its face worn. lilly winds a key and the wings of the doll flutter, accompanied by the whining sound of the internal mechanics. we see lilly's face as she stares at the doll. emotion fights to claw its way out from under her skin, but she doesn't let it. then in the distance we hear a child's cries. it almost sounds like memories wafting through the air, but the stamping of feet from the apartment above makes it plain that the noises come from there; the sound of children playing. cut to}
