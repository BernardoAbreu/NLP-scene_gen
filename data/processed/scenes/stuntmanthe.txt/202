<A>__{cameron starts running across the room and just as he's about to hurl it, he collides with a jutting shelf, which knocks him flat on his back. the shelf falls and thirty or forty one gallon paint cans cascade on top of him. it looks disastrous. nina runs to him, terrified, but before the last can has even come to rest, cameron emerges from the pile of cans, throwing them aside, still thrashing and screaming as he struggles to his feet. at the sight of him, nina starts laughing. but cameron, who has somehow managed to keep his grip on the laundry basket, raises it over his head as if nothing has happened, hurls the clothes bin, screaming:}
<C>__{cameron }
<D>__{scoop that up your royal bavarian strawberry snatch!}
<A>__{with the effort, cameron's feet fly out from under him as if he had stepped in oil. in fact, he has stepped in paint, and lands flat on his ass in the green goo. nina "bracks" out an uncontrollable guffaw.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(bellowing)}
<D>__{it's not funny!}
<A>__{shamed, nina runs to him.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{oh, baby...}
<A>__{but, as she reaches him, her feet too are caught in the paint and she slides forward like an ice skater, spraddling him, landing on her ass. his rage vanishes as he points at her, breaking into a fiendish, uncontrollable cackle. these pratfalls are a catharsis that has released the pressure and the madness. they attempt to gain their feet, skidding and sliding in the painterior he succeeds, but nina fails.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(through laughter)}
<D>__{let me go to the bathroom. i'm gonna have an accident.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{you'll miss the main part! killer cameron's ghastly crime! i was freaked out of my head! and, suddenly there's this big flashlight shining in my face. i just grabbed that goddamn ice cream bucket and slopped it...right over the guy's head!}
<A>__{although cameron's got nothing in his hands, he pantomimes swinging that fifty pound ice cream bucket around in the air, losing his balance and landing on his back in the paint beside nina. her hysteria is renewed, but cameron stops laughing.}
<C>__{cameron }
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{it's not funny. it wasn't him. it was a cop. i got out of there like a shot. i didn't know he was knocked out. how the hell did i know he was gonna lay there all night with his head in the ice cream?}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(suddenly serious)}
<D>__{oh, my god. he died?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{no, he's in the hospital.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{oh, no.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{oh, yes. that ice cream's goddamn cold!}
<P>__{(struggling for a proper description)}
<D>__{his nose...it froze and his ear froze, see...and...}
<A>__{despite the horror of it, nina starts giggling. she can't help it.}
<C>__{cameron }
<P>__{(indignantly)}
<D>__{no, it's terrible!...he lost the tip of his nose and his ear lobe...}
