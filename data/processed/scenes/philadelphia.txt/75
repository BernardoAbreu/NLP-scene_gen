<A>__{on the witness stand: a solidly built executive from a large insurance company, mr. laird (interior day) ...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{andrew beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?}
<C>__{laird}
<D>__{wyant wheeler represented us.}
<A>__{andrew glances toward the jury box: the marine juror writes in a tiny notebook.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{but, andrew beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.}
<C>__{laird}
<D>__{that's correct.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{were you pleased with his work?}
<C>__{laird}
<D>__{we were satisfied.}
<A>__{joe and andrew exchange a look laird's response surprises and disappoints them.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{were you satisfied, or were you pleased?}
<A>__{laird glances toward charles wheeler before answering.}
<C>__{laird}
<D>__{we were satisfied.}
<A>__{joe refers to legal documents.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{mr. laird, when i approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. is that correct?}
<C>__{laird}
<D>__{that's correct.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{according to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of andrew beckett's work. do you remember saying that?}
<C>__{laird}
<D>__{i may have said something like that. but that's not how i feel at this moment.}
<A>__{joe takes on a street tough tone:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{okay, mr. laird. explain this to me like i'm a four year old: did andrew beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?}
<C>__{laird}
<D>__{we won.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?}
<C>__{laird}
<D>__{it satisfied me.}
<A>__{joe stares at the guy.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. a cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. do you agree?}
<C>__{laird}
<D>__{i might.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{five months ago you characterized andrew beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. your standards have shifted a great deal, and i'd like to know why you've changed your mind.}
<C>__{laird}
<D>__{since that time i've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how i feel now.}
