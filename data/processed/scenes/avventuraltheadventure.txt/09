<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{along a narrow strip of beach on the island of lisca bianca, sandro, anna, corrado and giulia are waiting for claudia to come ashore. there are some patches of vegetation growing here and there, but by and large the island is one huge rock with rugged cliffs which descend perpendicularly to the water. jutting promontories give the place a sense of raw, primitive beauty. seeing anna and sandro climbing a short distance up along the rocks to find a comfortable place where they can lie down and stretch themselves, corrado remarks:}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{if any of you get into your bathing suits again, you can be sure we won't be seeing one another for the rest of the year. i just can't stand seeing anybody in the city after having seen them naked on the beach.}
<A>__{the yacht finally has arrived and the gangplank is laid out between the boat and the shore. claudia descends and as she wades ashore she stops, bends over to dip her hand in the water, and with a tone of voice resembling that of a mother speaking to its newborn child, she pretends she is speaking with someone or something in the water.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{oh, how sweet... what a dear little darling!}
<A>__{they all turn around to look at her, wondering to whom or what she is referring.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{who are you talking to?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{to the shark.}
<A>__{they all break out into a laugh, and claudia continues her comic bit as she playfully pretends to lose her balance on the slippery pebbles along the shore. corrado looks at her somewhat surprised, as though up until now he had never seen her comport herself with such a lively sense of humor and wit.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{say, claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{at what?}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{at the ruins. they're very ancient, you know.}
<A>__{out of the entire group, claudia is perhaps the only one who really has the desire to explore, to see, and to generally take advantage of whatever the cruise has to offer.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{that sounds like a good idea. but why don't we all go together?}
<A>__{though claudia's suggestion is heard by all, none of them make a move. relaxing so comfortably in the sun as they are, it seems the last thing they would want to do is to climb up the rocky slopes. so claudia starts to go up on her own, following corrado who is already under way. but giulia immediately comes up to him and, squeezing his arm to emphasize her plea, whispers to him:}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{please, i beg of you, stay here.}
<A>__{giulia's plea is expressed with such a pitiful sense of humility that claudia is immediately taken aback, although she does not fully understand its motive.}
<C>__{corrado}
<P>__{(noticing claudia's hesitancy)}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{well, what?}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{have you decided?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{all i said was that it sounds like a good idea.}
<A>__{disappointed and rather irritated, corrado turns back, while claudia looks around for a place on the rocks where she can comfortably set herself down. giulia, in turn, approaches corrado.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{why didn't you ask me to go with you?}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{do you know why? because if you saw those ruins i'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. you always say "how beautiful" to everything whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! you have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.}
<C>__{corrado}
<P>__{(ironically)}
<D>__{but corrado... if something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?}
<C>__{giulia}
<P>__{(referring to corrado)}
<D>__{he never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{giulia, that remark is not worthy of our twelve years of honest concubinage. i repeat, once and for all, and publicly, that i admire you. does that please you?}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(under her breath to anna and sandro)}
<D>__{twelve years ... but why haven't they married?}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(with a faint smile)}
<D>__{and why haven't they left each other?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm beginning to have my doubts. it couldn't be that they're in love?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{could be. they're the kind of people who are capable of anything.}
<A>__{sandro suddenly grabs anna around the waist and pulls her to him. his action is so unexpected that even anna is astonished. but giulia's voice is heard again.}
<C>__{giulia}
<P>__{(to corrado)}
<D>__{the trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(placatingly)}
<D>__{giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{you men are all so dreadful!}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i know we are. but as the years go by, we become even worse. isn't that so, corrado?}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{i hope so.}
<A>__{breaking the nervous tension that has spread itself throughout the group, a seaman appears with a small basket of frozen peaches brought from the yacht. claudia runs to the basket, picks up a peach and quickly bites into it.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{how wonderful!}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{that's patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.}
<A>__{claudia takes another peach from the basket and gives it to corrado.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i think you're very sweet, corrado.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{more so than the shark?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{there's no comparison.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{then why don't we go up and see the ruins?}
