<T>__{then:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's amazing to me. you're married.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you're not only someone's girlfriend, your someone's wife!}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{pretty crazy, huh?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{i will never understand that.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{tom }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what's different now? how could things change so quickly?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i don't know. it just happened.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what happened?! that's what i don't get.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i... tom...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what, tell me...}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i woke up one day and i knew.}
<A>__{tom says nothing.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i knew i could promise him i'd feel the same way every morning. in a way that i... i never could with you.}
<A>__{and there's not much else to say after that. tom gets up to leave.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you know what sucks? realizing that everything you believe in is complete bullshit.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{what is?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{destiny, soulmates, true love. all that stuff. it's nothing more than silly childhood fairy tale nonsense, isn't it? god!}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{tom, don't go.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i should have listened to you, summer. you were right all along.}
<A>__{summer takes a beat to let this hang there.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i was right?}
<A>__{and then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what? this is funny?}
<A>__{tries to stop but it only makes it worse. now's she's completely cracking up.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what are you laughing at?}
<A>__{and she can't stop. she's totally lost control.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(trying himself not to laugh)}
<D>__{you're a crazy person!}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{tom! you're the crazy person!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what are you talking about?!}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{one day i'm reading a book at the corner deli and this guy sits down and starts asking about it. now he's my husband!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this is funny to you?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{what would have happened if i went to the movies instead? if i went somewhere else for lunch? if i showed up to eat ten minutes later? tom, it was meant to be, just like you said. and as it was happening, i knew it. i could feel it, sure as the sun. and i kept thinking to myself "holy shit. tom was right." you were right about all of it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it just wasn't me you were right about.}
<A>__{tom is speechless. summer takes his hand. we may notice her wedding ring. we may also notice that this is the same exact shot as the first scene of the screenplay. we hold it for a few seconds more. and then, the hands separate.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{anyway, i should probably be getting back. it was good to see you. i'm glad you're well.}
<A>__{summer gets up and starts walking away from him. after a}
