<A>__{she shakes his hand and is about to close the door when venkman appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{hi, dana.}
<A>__{dana is caught completely off guard by venkman's surprise appearance.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{i knew you'd come crawling back to me.}
<A>__{she regards him coolly, as always amused and amazed at his presumptuousness.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{hello, peter.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(to dana)}
<D>__{you know, dana, i'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first. i'm still into all this stuff, you know. haven't you ever seen my show?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{i have. that's why i didn't call you first.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{i can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, i'm going to give it my best shot. let's go to work, boys.}
<A>__{stantz and spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work up on the baby and the immediate physical environment.}
<B>__{venkman and dana}
<A>__{venkman starts nosing around the apartment. dana follows him.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{so what happened to mr. right? i hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to europe.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{he didn't "ditch" me. we had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in england and he took it.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{he ditched you. you should've married me, you know.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{you never asked me, and every time i brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{men are very sensitive, you know. we need to feel loved and desired, too.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when i left.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{i may have a few personal problems but one thing i am is a total professional.}
<A>__{he leaves her and crosses to spengler.}
<B>__{spengler}
<A>__{he's taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby with a tape measure and calipers.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{what are you going to do, egon? knit him a snowsuit?}
<A>__{spengler ignores the remark and hands venkman a specimen jar.}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{i'd like to have a stool specimen}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{yeah, you would. is that for personal or professional reasons?}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(picking up the baby)}
<D>__{okay, kid. up you go.}
<A>__{he starts clowning with the baby, holding him over his head and pressing his nose into the baby's belly, pretending that the baby is attacking him.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{help! please somebody help me! get him off! quickly! he's gone completely berserk!}
<A>__{dana is amused and somewhat disarmed by venkman's rapport with the baby.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{there's no doubt about it. he's got his father's looks. the kid is ugly extremely ugly. and smelly.}
<P>__{(resumes playing with the baby)}
<D>__{you stink! it's just horrible. you are the stinkiest baby i ever smelled.}
<P>__{(to dana)}
<D>__{what's his name?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{his name is oscar.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{oscar! you poor kid!}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(losing patience)}
<D>__{peter, this is serious. i need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{unusual?}
<P>__{(holds up the baby and scrutinizes him)}
<D>__{i don't know. i haven't had a lot of experience with babies.}
<A>__{he looks at the baby, pulling his feet up, trying to get the sleeper off.}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(taking the specimen jar)}
<D>__{i will do it.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{i will supervise.}
