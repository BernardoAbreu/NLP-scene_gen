<L>__{interior javaman cafe hollywood day}
<A>__{too early for the brunch crowd, just a smattering of vampires. all around, christmas lights are strung with mad abandon. the lights overhead flicker. everyone looks up. that's when we come to find}
<B>__{todd gaines}
<A>__{sitting alone at a booth by the window, disassembling a newspaper. he finds the comics. laying the paper flat, he tears off the bottom corner of the page and starts reading like a kid, his whole body leaning over the table. at the door, claire comes in, shaking the rain out of her hair. after a beat, she does it again, as if she doesn't remember doing it the first time. she's tired and wired, all nerves and raw edges. there's static only she can feel. she looks right past gaines, out to the rain on the street. he watches her, but doesn't try to catch her eye. the jamaican waiter walks past her with a pot of coffee.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{anywhere you want.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i'm meeting people.}
<A>__{he doesn't care. claire takes a seat at the table in front of her, but it's not to her liking. then a booth. she plays with the salt shakers. bad. it's only now that she sees gaines watching her. at first she doesn't recognize him. then a light goes on. she climbs over the booth and into his, facing him.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{we're twins.}
<A>__{she turns over his hand, compares it to hers. they both have the same ink stamp on the back. he's busted, no way to talk himself out. the waiter comes with coffee, refills gaines' cup. claire overturns the cup in front of her. the waiter fills it. she overturns a second cup, points to it. a big weird smile. reluctantly, the waiter fills that too. then leaves.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i will pay you back for breakfast.}
<P>__{(leaning closer)}
<D>__{don't worry. i'm not really that hungry.}
<A>__{she sheds her coat, having great difficulty with one sleeve.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{have you seen ronna? or mannie?}
<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{see, when we go out, we always meet here afterwards in case we get separated.}
<C>__{claire }
<D>__{it happens more than you'd think. i've been paging her, but she hasn't called back.}
<A>__{the lights flicker again, storm still raging. halfway into getting her coat off, claire has second thoughts, but continues nonetheless. gaines is taken off balance, his private space violated. claire finally looks up at gaines, smiles. a beat.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{unless you wanted to eat alone.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{no. it's fine.}
