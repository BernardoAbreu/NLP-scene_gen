<L>__{interior rebecca's bedroom evening}
<A>__{rain falls, streaking along the bedroom windows. candles light the room. dulaney and rebecca are on the bed. she sits on top of him, writhing back and forth lost in the rhythm of their love making. close on dulaney later he is asleep, laying on his back the sheets pulled up to his waist. lightning flashes outside a clap of thunder follows. he stirs and wakes up.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{another flash of lightning illuminates rebecca, who is standing over him in a sexy silk robe. dulaney starts to sit up but something restrains him. he is handcuffed to the brass head}
<B>__{board.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{what the... what are you doing?}
<A>__{she sits next to him looks at him fondly gently strokes his face with her hand.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{rebecca take these off.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{tonight we open new doors.}
<A>__{she slowly drags the tip of her finger up his stomach to his chest. dulaney follows it with his eyes. rebecca picks up a large candle on the nightstand and moves it slowly back and forth over his chest.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{what are you going you doing?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{are you scared?}
<A>__{he doesn't answer. he doesn't have to. she can see the fear in his eyes. she tilts the candle a stream of wax pours out on his chest. dulaney winces with pain, his body arching on the bed, his hands straining against his restraints. she smiles a wicked smile, then pours more wax, making a thin trail of little beads that moves down his chest towards his stomach. dulaney's face cringes. he stares at her through eyes filled with fear.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i love you, frank. i love your strength be strong for me now.}
<A>__{she continues to pour the wax in little beads, filling his navel and working her way towards his groin.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{rebecca please. no more.}
<A>__{rebecca stares at him warmly fondly.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i told you in the beginning that it was my way. my way can be many things pleasure or pain.}
<A>__{she lifts a bottle of white vinegar and holds it over his burn. he tenses as she pours it on his chest. then relaxes when he realizes it's water. he breathes a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{you see how life is, frank? we judge things. we look at things from the outside and assume we know what's on the inside.}
<A>__{she takes a sip from the bottle.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{water. but you assumed it was vinegar because you were only looking at the outside.}
<A>__{her meaning isn't lost on dulaney. she watches him as if studying him then slowly very slowly, she pulls on the belt of her robe. the robe parts revealing the beauty of her body. she gently lowers herself on top of him pressing her breasts against him. dulaney's breathing quickens in excitement. rebecca moves her head to his chest kissing his burns softly while her fingers caress lightly over his stomach. she gradually moves her head down lower and lower.}
<B>__{close on dulaney}
<A>__{he stares at the ceiling his mind a maze of confusion. soon the power of her touch fills him overpowering him. his eyes close. the pain that only moments ago filled his body is replaced with pleasure.}
