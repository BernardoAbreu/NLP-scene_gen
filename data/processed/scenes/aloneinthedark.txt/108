<L>__{125 interior carnby's loft later}
<A>__{carnby cooks omelettes in the kitchen area of the loft. the ingredients are spread out on the counter. aline wakes up. she sits up in the bed and looks around.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{something smells amazing.}
<A>__{aline trots over to the kitchen area as carnby serves up the omelettes. aline gives him a look.}
<C>__{aline }
<D>__{i love omelettes.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{carnby sits down across from aline. they eat while they talk.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{i figured out a connection with the symbols on those artifacts. they correspond to constellations. but something's missing.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{maybe this will help...}
<A>__{carnby takes out the assembled abkani device and puts it down on the table between them. aline picks up the device, fascinated. she runs her fingers over the abkani symbols carved into the lynchpin artifact. she goes to her bag and pulls out the map she was working on and the cd. she hands carnby the cd.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{can you run the program on this?}
<A>__{carnby goes over to his computer and inserts the cd. aline spreads out the map. she draws lines across it, connecting up constellations with locations on the map. she writes out latitude and longitude calculations. aline comes up to carnby at the computer. the program is waiting for her calculations. she leans past carnby and enters the latitude and longitude numbers into the program. the computer processes the information. hundreds of map images flash across the screen as the computer searches for a match.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{what are we looking for?}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{the abkani used constellations to pin point a geographical location. but i don't think i can isolate it closer than a hundred mile radius.}
<A>__{the computer finds a match. a specific map appears onscreen, with a 100 mile radius circle marked in the center of it.}
<C>__{line }
<D>__{edward...}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{yeah. that's us right there.}
<A>__{carnby points to a spot on the onscreen map.}
