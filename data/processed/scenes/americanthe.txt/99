<L>__{exterior courtyard night}
<A>__{we're recognise the secret courtyard: the one reached by means of the hidden archway. with one hand, jack feeds another sugar cube to the mongrel. with the other hand, he holds his walther behind his back... ...and cocks it.}
<L>__{exterior alleyway night}
<A>__{the young man is waiting at the far end of the alleyway, hugging the wall, scanning the crossroads ahead, unsure which of the four possible alleyways holds his prey. jack emerges from the hidden archway and walks quickly up behind him. jack has removed his shoes and his bare feet are silent. he has thirty metres to cover. the gun hangs heavy in his right hand. it's fitted with a tac 65 sound suppressor. he raises his right hand. twenty metres. the gun is pointing at the young man. fifteen metres. his finger takes up the slack of the trigger. ten meters. then: a ducati turns into the alleyway behind jack, its headlights on full beam. jack drops his right hand and thrusts his silenced walther deep into his jacket pocket. the young man looks his way. jack is outlined by the moped's beam of light. the two men are face to face, within spitting distance. the ducati hurtles towards the young man. the man on the ducati is wearing a tinted black crash helmet. the young man's eyes widen with fear. bang! the ducati misfires. mistaking the sound for gunfire, the young man drops, rolls and fires back. we hear the sound of a single suppressed shot: choop! the bullet grazes the front suspension of the ducati and lodges in the rear cowling. the man on the ducati swerves and crashes, hitting a stone staircase. jack looks around. the young man has disappeared. the man on the ducati is out cold. the front wheel of his ducati turns slowly, squeaking. choop! a bullet hits the road not far from jack. choop! another bullet hits the wall behind him. swiftly, jack grabs hold of the battered 1970s ducati...}
