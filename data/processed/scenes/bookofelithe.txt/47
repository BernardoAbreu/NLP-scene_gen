<L>__{exterior desert town barnyard day}
<A>__{a small, penned in area to the rear of the palladium containing an eclectic bunch of farmyard animals. goats, sheep, geese, pigs. mostly mangy, sad looking specimens. carnegie stands in the yard, tossing handfuls of animal feed from a nearby sack onto the ground. he watches with satisfaction as the animals gather at his feet to feed. claudia emerges from the theater with an ice pack.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{thank you, darling.}
<A>__{carnegie applies it to his jaw, red and swollen from eli's pistol whip. redridge appears nearby, his arm in a sling.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{he killed four of my men and walked out of town without a scratch. they shot off a hundred rounds at him and he didn't get hit once. i never even heard of anything like that.}
<A>__{carnegie doesn't appear to be listening. he is lost in a world of his own as he tends to the farm animals.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you know, i always thought of myself as a shepherd. bringing together the wayward and the lost. tending to my flock. but all the things i want to do, i can't do them on my own. the one thing i've needed is the one thing that's always been missing. then one day it walks right into town so close i can almost touch it and then walks right on out again.}
<A>__{carnegie finally looks up from his animals, at redridge.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{i want you to put a crew together and go out after him.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{he's not going to work for you. i think he's made that plain.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{i'm not interested in him any more. i only want the book he's carrying.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{if i'm gonna risk my ass hunting down this maniac in the outland, i need to know it's gonna be worth it. i need to know what's so special about this goddamn book.}
<A>__{beat as carnegie considers this.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you have no idea. you're too young, you don't remember the world before. but i do. i remember.}
<A>__{he turns back to his animals, summoning up old memories.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{when i was a kid my parents used to read that book every goddamn day. my mother, she'd read it along with this smooth talking preacher on the tv screen. they used to be able to beam these guys right into your house, into every house in the world, through the air. like magic.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{she worked two jobs and she sent every spare penny she had to that fucking guy on the tv. my old man, he'd read that book, then he'd get liquored up and kick my ass, tell me all about the power and the glory and how i was going to burn forever in hell for the sins i was born with. he made sure he beat it into me good.}
<A>__{he snaps out of his reverie and looks at redridge.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{don't you see? it's not just any book.}
<C>__{carnegie }
<D>__{it has the power to motivate people. it can give them hope, it can terrify them. it can shape them. control them.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do you remember how i built this town? it wasn't done with force, and it wasn't done just with water. it was done with the power of words. i created this place out of nothing, because people believed in a promise that i sold to them. those guys on the tv, they were richer than you could ever dream, and it was all built the same way. with words. with promises. and with that book.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that book is a weapon. aimed right at the hearts and minds of the weak and the desperate. just imagine what i could do with it.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{boss... we're running out of water and the people are running out of patience. you're trying to tell me that a book is going to keep them in line?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{oh, it'll do much more than that. the water in this town may run dry, but faith that springs eternal! and that faith will help turn this town into a city. and this city into a nation. it will help me build a new world. in my image. people will come from far and wide to hear what's inside of it. they'll follow me anywhere just to get a taste of it. and they'll do whatever i tell them.}
<A>__{as usual, carnegie's slick rhetoric has worked redridge has totally bought into it. claudia, however, looks appalled.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{and what if this book don't work? what if it don't say what you want it to say?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{oh, it'll say what i want, i can promise you that. because i'm going to rewrite it. i will keep the parts that work for me and make the rest whatever i need it to be.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a new bible, for a new world.}
<A>__{he reaches out and takes claudia by the hand.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{what do you think, darling? a whole new world, to do with as we will. won't that be grand?}
<A>__{she smiles halfheartedly, but it's clear she is mortified. carnegie turns back to redridge.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{find that book.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{he has half a day on us already.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{so use the motor pool.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{there ain't much gas in reserve.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{whatever there is, use it.}
<A>__{redridge nods and goes to leave.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{what about solara?}
<A>__{beat. in all this excitement about the book, she had been completely forgotten about.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{she's still out there. with him.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{right. right. of course. bring her back, too, if you can. but }
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{the book. i know.}
<A>__{redridge turns and leaves. claudia scowls at carnegie, but he doesn't even notice, just goes back to feeding his animals.}
