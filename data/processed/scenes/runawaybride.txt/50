<A>__{you won't believe what i'm looking at, fisher. a videotape of all three train wrecks. the tv close two flower girls and peggy enter a crowded church where the groom, brian, and his best man wait at the altar. now we see maggie come down the aisle, then walk past the altar. we see maggie move away another aisle and out of the church. shocked wedding guests rise in horror, as she runs from this first wedding. she drags the train boy up the second aisle as she leaves. ike hangs up. he gets up to pick up the remote and then sits back down to watch. the tape fast forwards to the next wedding. now ike is looking at a much more relaxed, hipper, backyard wedding. it says, "gill chavez wedding". he hits the fast forward button (sometimes slowing down).}
