<A>__{robert cecil is standing at the opulent river entrance to cecil house, waiting for an enormous barge docking. william cecil (now 75) is at the front of the barge, waiting to disembark. he constantly holds an ornately carved white cane.}
<C>__{william cecil}
<D>__{so! i am gone for three days, and you somehow manage to let her spend all of them solely in the company of the earl of essex...}
<A>__{robert cecil looks at him sharply. how did he know.}
<C>__{william cecil }
<D>__{don't think because i was in london, i didn't know exactly what went on here in my absence.}
<C>__{robert cecil}
<D>__{he is an earl, father. i cannot deny him }
<C>__{william cecil}
<D>__{of course not! you don't deny him anything. you find excuses. she is unwell, she is reading, she is seeing the ambassador from russia. for god's sake, use your imagination, robert. whatever will you do when i am gone?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we will have to deal with essex soon. his ambitions are becoming a nuisance.}
