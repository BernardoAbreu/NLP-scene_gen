<A>__{at the cut a new mercedes screeches through the frame and, as we hear it recede, we are left looking at the kid, who stands at the curb, waving happily.}

<D>__{bye santa!}
<L>__{interior chamberlain's security office night}

<C>__{gin}
<D>__{"little people," that's what they like.}
<C>__{chipeska}
<D>__{ah, yes, right.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{so "fuck stick," that's all?}
<C>__{chipeska}
<D>__{well, no, there was something else...}
