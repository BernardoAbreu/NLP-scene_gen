<A>__{thunderously loud, with industrial washers and dryers operating at full tilt. natalie and dylan are just entering when}
<B>__{three shots}
<A>__{ring out. they dive for cover behind a massive washer assembly.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{there are times i wish we carried guns.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{where's the challenge in that?}
<A>__{angle on the thin man, planning his next move. with no good shot at the angels, he aims high, both guns blazing. he shots out the pipes over their heads, sending down a cascade of hot water. dylan and natalie scramble back to avoid getting scalded. other pipes shatter from the change in pressure, leading to an interior thunderstorm. steam fills the room as an inch of water grows on the floor. natalie and dylan push rolling laundry carts in the thin man's direction. he shoots at them, but quickly realizes they're just trying to waste his bullets. holstering one of his guns, he dials his cell phone. charlie's angels 8 18 99 on the far wall, natalie switches on the overhead hooks, which circle on a wire like a ski lift. the thin man looks up, distracted, not noticing }
<B>__{dylan}
<A>__{as she creeps up behind the cover of the rolling laundry carts. she's succeeded in circling behind the thin man as he talks on the phone. she clears her throat. the thin man turns. she kicks him in the jaw. knocked back, he drops the phone, which cracks and slips under a washing machine. he crab walks back, then suddenly springs back to his feet. we weren't expecting that kind of ninja move out of this guy.}
<B>__{he turns to see natalie}
<A>__{right behind him. with a coiled towel, she grabs his gun arm and expertly flips him. but he reacts smoothly, rolling over to charge at natalie, picking her up like a sack of potatoes. as he does, he grabs her right in the tit.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{hey! hands off, assh....}
<A>__{before she can finish her sentence, the thin man throws natalie at dylan, knocking them both down. he jumps up, and with a single motion grabs an overhead pipe and kicks another, releasing a wall of steam we can't see a thing. by the time the fog clears, the thin man is long gone.}

<D>__{okay, to summarize? damn.}
<A>__{lying down in the water, dylan reaches under the washer to fish out the thin man's busted cell phone.}
