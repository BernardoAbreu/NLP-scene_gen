<L>__{exterior jim and megan's house day}
<A>__{a big station wagon is parked between a small mobile home and a half finished house being built by jim and megan wallace, an out going, energetic older couple. lumber, cinder blocks, and tools are scattered around the yard. jim examines edgar's body in the bed of val and earl's pick up truck. val, earl and megan talk in subdued tones.}

<D>__{real sorry to bother you, megan, but we figured since jim's a doctor...}
