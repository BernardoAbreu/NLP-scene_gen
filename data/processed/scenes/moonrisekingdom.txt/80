<T>__{ominously:}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{they found the canoe.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(angry at himself)}
<D>__{rats! i should've put more pine needles on it. let's go. we're almost there.}
<A>__{sam lifts his backpack onto his back and slings his air rifle over his arm. suzy picks up her suitcases and puts the kitten on her shoulder. they walk down a narrow path through a thicket. they emerge into a small clearing. sam and suzy stop in their tracks. deluca, nickleby, panagle, izod, and lazy eye stand in a row along the edge of the woods ahead of them. deluca brandishes his hunting knife. nickleby, izod, and lazy eye point their bows and arrows. panagle holds his walking stick weapon. the wire haired terrier strains growling at the end of his leash. deluca jerks him back. the kitten cowers. the sound of a motorcycle guns, and redford bursts through the trees, pops a wheelie, and skids to a stop. he lifts his goggles. the motor idles. sam says finally:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what do you creeps want?}
<A>__{redford shrugs and answers with a callous smile:}
<C>__{redford}
<D>__{we're looking for you.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{redford}
<D>__{because you're a fugitive.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no, i'm not. didn't you get my letter of resignation? i quit the khaki scouts.}
<C>__{redford}
<D>__{you're still in uniform.}
<A>__{pause. sam quickly takes off his shirt and throws it aside.}
<C>__{redford}
<D>__{well, it doesn't matter, anyway. you don't have that authority. we've been deputized. now are you going to come along peacefully or not?}
<A>__{sam takes a deep breath. he pleads:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{listen to some reason: i don't like you. you don't like me. why don't you stupid idiots just let us disappear?}
<C>__{redford}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it's tempting, but i can't allow it.}
<A>__{deluca spits on the ground. he says to suzy:}
<C>__{deluca}
<D>__{you shouldn't be friends with him.}
<C>__{suzy}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{deluca}
<D>__{because he's crazy.}
<C>__{suzy}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{maybe you just don't know him.}
<C>__{redford}
<D>__{we know him a lot better than you. he's emotionally disturbed because his family died. nickleby, tie him up.}
<A>__{nickleby takes a step forward with his bow and arrow pointed and ready. suzy looks furious. sam flips his air rifle off his shoulder with a twirl. he points it at redford and nickleby. nickleby hesitates. sam says darkly:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{do not cross this stick.}
<A>__{sam motions to a twig on the ground in front of him. silence.}
<C>__{redford}
<D>__{you're doomed, shakusky.}
<A>__{redford revs the motor, pops the clutch, and races across the clearing toward sam and suzy. the rest of the troop converges, yelling crazily.}
