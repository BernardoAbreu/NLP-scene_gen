<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior suburban street day}
<A>__{veronica sawyer, a sullen seventeen year old beauty is jogging down a suburban street in a stylish running outfit. evocative female voices can be heard, softly wailing.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood park day}
<A>__{veronica lurches into a neighborhood park, running with an increasing sense of desperation. the female voices wail louder.}
<L>__{exterior promenade day}
<A>__{veronica whooshes past a series of shops and a movie theatre.}
<L>__{exterior the sawyer home day}
<A>__{reveling in her own sweat and agony, veronica bounds onto the lawn of her impressive upper middle class home. she painfully rushes closer and closer to the front door as the female moans swell to a deafening summit. the evocative wailing cuts off as she grabs the doorknob. iny. veronica's bedroom day veronica zips into a chic, but understated ensemble as she launches into voice over narration.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{heather told me she teaches people real life.}
<A>__{composed and unsweaty, veronica fingers her bangs in the mirror then rambles off.}
<L>__{interior high school hallway day}
<A>__{continuing her narration, veronica glides through a bustling high school hallway with a frozen smile.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{she said real life sucks losers dry. if you want to fuck with the eagles, you have to learn to fly.}
<B>__{outside the cafeteria}
<A>__{with her back turned to the viewer, veronica stands at the outskirts of the cafeteria entrance. the viewer's viewpoint approaches and finally curls around veronica to reveal that she is writing in a diary, wearing a monocle.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{i said so you teach people how to spread their wings and fly. she said yes.}
<B>__{the diary page}
<A>__{veronica's pen sways across the diary page forming the words echoed by her voice over.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{i said you're beautiful.}
<A>__{a sudden off screen bark from heather mcnamara causes the pen to recklessly rocket across the written words.}
<C>__{heather mcnamara }
<D>__{god, come on veronica!}
<A>__{veronica coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily addressing the amusingly robust, conventionally beautiful, trendily coiffed heather mcnamara.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{what's your damage, heather? you ruined my...}
<C>__{heather mcnamara}
<D>__{god, i'm so sure. don't blame me, blame heather. she told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. back me up, heather.}
<A>__{from behind heather mcnamara emerges a similarly trendily accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif, heather duke. she is clutching a tattered copy of "the catcher in the rye."}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{yeah, she really wants to talk to you.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{okay, i'm going, i'm going. jesus...}
<B>__{inside the cafeteria}
<A>__{veronica, flanked by heather mcnamara and heather duke, strides into the lunchroom pandemonium. the stunning heather chandler turns from the tray before her toward her incoming comrades. she is dressed stylishly and expensively but not trendily; her hair, dramatically tied back.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(submissively)}
<D>__{hello, heather.}
<A>__{pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper, heather chandler smiles. the content of what heather says is consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks is sexy, dangerous, and mysterious. she is a mythic bitch.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{veronica. finally. got a paper of kurt kelly's. i need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low key note in kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into martha dumptruck's lunch tray.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{shit, heather. i don't have anything against martha dunnstock.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{you don't have anything for her either. come on, it'll be very. the note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i will think about it.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<P>__{(looking off)}
<D>__{don't think.}
<B>__{pov on cafeteria line}
<A>__{unattractive and quite overweight, martha dunnstock dumptruck guiltily plops two jellos on her tray and clunks forward in line.}
<B>__{cafeteria entrance}
<A>__{veronica's arm, seemingly involuntary, latches onto the outstretched pen.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{splendid. i will dictate. veronica needs something to write on. heather, bend over.}
<A>__{both heather mcnamara and heather duke bend over. heather chandler violently laughs.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{how nice. two assholes: no waiting.}
<A>__{heather mcnamara and heather duke stand erect, embarrassed.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{heather duke, back down.}
<A>__{veronica scurries to the contorting heather duke.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{dear martha, you're so sweet..}
<A>__{the jocks' table the traditionally handsome kurt kelly, the serene black earl frazier and the massive ram sit with other stereotypical jocks taking in veronica and the heathers.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{it'd be so righteous to be in a veronica sawyer heather chandler sandwich. punch it in, ram.}
<A>__{kurt and ram raise their right arms and slam their fists together.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{hell yes. i wanna set a heather on my johnson and just start spinning her like a fucking pinwheel.}
<A>__{ram makes a frantic spinning motion. earl is bored.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{shit. right.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{damn right right.}
<B>__{cafeteria entrance}
<A>__{in slow motion, veronica finishes the note and rises up along with her makeshift desk, heather duke. heather mcnamara hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line. veronica hands the note to an impressed heather chandler. martha dunnstock dumptruck pays the cashier and then, grasping her lunch tray with both paws, moves toward veronica and the heathers. heather mcnamara excitedly tugs on heather chandler's arm as martha approaches. with a tranquil smile, heather chandler passes the note to her frantic disciple. in a self consciously clandestine manner, heather mcnamara saunters past martha then wields around to sneakily tuck the note onto martha's tray. the slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles past a magnetic preppie peter dawson and a thin, black, bespectacled dennis. the guys are working a large stand which has a cashbox reading the famine fund and a banner reading westerburg feeds the world.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{come on people, let's give that leftover lunch money to people without lunches! those tater tots you threw away today are a delicacy in africa! they're thanksgiving dinner!}
<A>__{heathers' table the girls reach their table with heather mcnamara and heather duke sitting themselves down first.}
<C>__{heather mcnamara}
<P>__{(looking to the stand)}
<D>__{god, aren't they fed yet? do they even have thanksgiving in africa?}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(low key sarcasm)}
<D>__{oh sure, pilgrims, indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.}
<A>__{heather chandler draws up a clipboard.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{sawyer. guess what today is?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{ouch....the lunchtime poll. so what's the question?}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{yeah, so what's the question?}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{god damn heather, you were with me in study hall when i thought of it. such a pillowcase.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{i forgot.}
<A>__{veronica and heather chandler briskly bop away from the table as a wounded heather duke retreats to the catcher in the rye.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{shut up, it is. i told dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, i'd spew burrito chunks.}
<A>__{veronica shakes her head and looks off. she's suddenly captured by the sight of a james deanesque guy sitting stark in a long, tan gunslinger coat, behind a rebel without a cause lunchbox. they make eye contact. transfixed, veronica crashes into seated betty finn, a slightly overweight, unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by clones.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{sorry veronica.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{betty finn. gosh.....}
<A>__{veronica crouches down, embarrassed and rueful.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i'm really sorry i couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{that's okay. your mom said you had a big date. heck, i'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.}
<A>__{veronica gently laughs at betty's innocent awe.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{don't say that.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh ronnie, you have to look at what i dug up the other day.}
<A>__{betty pulls from her purse a picture showing a young betty finn and veronica sawyer, arm in arm, dressed in halloween costumes: betty is an angel, veronica is a witch. veronica glows at the photo until heather chandler tows veronica away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i was talking with someone!}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{color me impressed. i thought you grew out of betty finn.}
<A>__{the country club kids' table a coolly coed cabal of country club kids icily eye the approaching veronica and heather chandler. country club kid coutrney sourly speaks out.}
<C>__{courtney}
<D>__{oh great. here comes heather.}
<C>__{courtney's friend}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{martha dunnstock dumptruck's table alone at a table in the siberia of the cafeteria, martha finishes a forkful of chicken. she spears her plate again and brings the fork up. the note is wedged inside it. the country club kids' table heather chandler, veronica in tow, hits the country club kids with a salvo of false pleasantness, capped by a scowling smile.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{hi courtney. love your blouse. ooh, let me snare a tater.}
<A>__{courtney express elation in spite of yourself as heather chandler delicately takes a tot and turns around to face veronica. heather chandler inserts her finger in her mouth doing the "induce vomiting" signal before devouring the tot and turning back around.}
<C>__{courtney}
<D>__{thanks. i just got it last night at the limited. totally blew my allowance.}
<A>__{heather chandler raises her clipboard. veronica closes her eyes and shakes her head with a half smile.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{that's pretty very. now check this out. you win five million dollars from publishers clearing house, but on the same day ed mcmahon gives you the check, aliens land on earth and say they're going to blow up the world in two days. what would you do?}
<A>__{a stunned tableau; until country club kid keith speaks.}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{that's easy. i'd just slide that wad over to my father. he's like one of the top brokers in the state .}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{wake up. in two days, earth's going up like a roman candle. crab nebula city.}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{man, in two days, my dad could double my money. triple it.}
<C>__{courtney}
<D>__{if i got that money, i'd give it all to the poor. every cent.}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{dennis, my man, run over to mickey d.'s and get me a big mac and some fries.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{but that's the famine fund money.}

<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{fuck me gently with a chainsaw. do i look like mother theresa? if i did, i probably wouldn't mind talking to the geek squad.}
<A>__{she points to a table of unfashionably dressed and coiffed students. some wear glasses, some wear braces, some wear both. the geeks' table the geeks react to being pointed at. their boney leader rodney splatters milk over himself.}

<A>__{veronica peers around a corner to see an empty hallway.}
<B>__{under the bleachers}
<A>__{using heavy black masking tape, j.d. tapes a thermal bomb to a steel support beneath the bleachers. other thermal bombs can be discerned taped to other supports.}
<B>__{the empty hallway}
<A>__{veronica cautiously treads down the empty hallway, trying to keep in control. suddenly, packs of students burst from classroom doors behind veronica. the excited swarms of students move toward and past veronica, who has braked her troubled treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers. she latches onto geek rodney in a panic. rodney looks down at his clutched arm with a nervous smile.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{rodney, where's everybody going?}
<C>__{rodney}
<D>__{it's friday.....}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{oh my god, the damn pep assembly....}
<C>__{rodney}
<D>__{yeah, these things are pretty artificial, but at least we all get out of class...}
<A>__{veronica ignores rodney's amiable attemots at conversation to inquisitively move forward through the crowd.}
<B>__{the gym}
<A>__{j.d. darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors. he pops the doors open and sees the crowd of students move toward the gym. he suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby set of stairs.}
<B>__{the hallway leading to the gym}
<A>__{veronica continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of students heading for the gymnasium. she stops to watch her classmates file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of dread. she again latches onto a passing rodney.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{rodney, what's underneath the gym?}
<A>__{rodney (unconsciously) dramatically stops, turns to veronica. and says........}
<C>__{rodney}
<D>__{the boiler room.}
<A>__{veronica blanches then lunges through the crowd. she topples a couple disgruntled students before careening down the staircase beside the gym.}
<B>__{hallway outside the boiler room}
<A>__{j.d. walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room, eyeing the pounding generators inside. he stops at a heavy steel door. placing down his gym bag, j.d. proceeds to swiftly pick the lock. he swings open the steel door.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{may i see your hall pass?}
<A>__{j.d. weilds around. a sweating veronica moves toward him, pointing the bedroom gun at him.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i knew that loose was too noose! i mean, noose too loose! goddamn you!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{like father, like son. a serious as fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.}
<A>__{j.d. looks down at the gym bag already on the ground. he folds his arms and smiles. veronica forcefully moves closer.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{okay, okay. i knew that. i knew that. put your hands on your head.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you didn't say simon says.}
<A>__{j.d. suddenly kicks out into veronica's stomach, doubling her over and causing her to drop the gun. j.d. gracefully retrieves it.}
<B>__{the gym}
<A>__{the pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy students in the bleachers earthily shouting, giggling cheerleaders making swaying pyramids, valiant band members struggling to be heard. various jocks, including earl, stand on the stage with principal gowan as a yearbook photographer flashes away.}
<B>__{the hallway before the boiler room}
<A>__{veronica bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs. j.d. raises the gun to her head.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{live by the sword...}
<A>__{veronica swings her left arm up knocking j.d.'s gun hand upward. she then sails her right fist into his face. the blow annoys him more than it hurts him but j.d.'s momentary loss of composure allows veronica to come in with another much harder right hook. the blow sends j.d. stumbling back against the boiler room, jarring the gun loose. they simultaneously lunge for the gun. veronica, having the better grip, pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun from j.d., she loses control of it, flinging it down the hall. veronica pops up to retrieve it but j.d. moves his legs scissors style around her and trips her.}
<B>__{the prep assembly}
<A>__{the assembly mindlessly blares on. cheerleader heather mcnamara rah rah rahs. rodney and the other geeks pass around a pair of opera glasses, all intensely scoping out the cheerleaders. a group of stoners toke away beneath the bleachers, one of them lackadaisically leaning against a thermal bomb.}
<B>__{the boiler room hallway}
<A>__{a snarling j.d. stands up, pulling veronica with him.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you think just because you started this thing, you can end it?}
<A>__{j.d. violently kisses bites veronica. while kissing, veronica sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall. she closes her eyes then savagely knees j.d. in the groin. veronica bolts to the alarm and pulls it down. nothing happens. j.d. gasps.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you, really didn't think i'd, forget, forget, to disconnect the....}
<A>__{veronica rockets her body down and picks up the gun. j.d. grabs her and throws her against the steel boiler room door. a jostled veronica raises the gun. j.d. howls then bounds toward veronica, causing them both to careen down the steel steps of the boiler room. at the same time, he inadvertently kicks the gym bag bomb down along with them. the gun spins from veronica's hand and slides away. the bomb flies out of the bag onto the boiler room floor. a digital clock on the bomb clicks on at 5:00....4:59....4:58...}
<B>__{the pep assembly}
<A>__{the frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing "the wave". betty finn and her similar co horts deliriously get into the act, all sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers, pouting as students bounce up and down around them. earl and the other jocks stand on the stage grinning and preening before the crowd.}
<B>__{the boiler room}
<A>__{veronica and j.d. are in a heap at the bottom of the boiler room steps. veronica faintly works into a semi sitting position and gives an astonished glance to the bomb, its digital clock clicking to 3:00. veronica crawls to the gun and levels it at a rousing up j.d.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{the bomb's gone on, j.d.! how do you turn it off? tell me!}
<A>__{fully standing, j.d. flicks open his switchblade. he gives veronica "the finger," screaming in exploded saliva...}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{seething, veronica shoots up at j.d. blowing off "the finger." shrieking in pain, j.d. drops the knife to hold this sudden geyser of blood. veronica achingly stands, pointing the gun. the bomb clicks down to 2:25.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{it's all over, j.d. help me to stop it.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you want to wipe the slate clean as much as i do. okay, so maybe i am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. you have a purpose though! remember? let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.}
<A>__{veronica fires the gun at j.d.'s feet. the bomb clicks to 1:49.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{how do you turn the fucker off?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you're not listening. people are going to look at the ashes of westerburg and say there's a school that self destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school was society. is that deep or what? i will let you put it in your diary, babe. free of charge.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{the bomb, asshole!}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{just push the red button twice. that's what stops it. if that's what you want, babe?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you know what i want, babe?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{veronica fires the gun twice into j.d.'s throat. coughing and moaning, he splatters against a generator.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{cool guys like you out of my life.}
<A>__{veronica saunters to j.d.'s writhing body.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{but babe, don't worry, these here were ich luge bullets.}
<A>__{j.d. closes his eyes and slumps to the ground. veronica turns to the bomb and crouches over it. a lit green light is next to a green button. above it, an unlit red light is next to a red button. the bomb's digital clock clicks to 00:17. veronica presses the red button twice, turning on the red light and stopping the clock. veronica falls back into a sitting position and sorely exhales, tears streaming down her face.}
<B>__{the pep assembly}
<A>__{a cheerleader does a cartwheel in slow motion as eerie music plays. the manic crowd in the bleachers vibrates in slow motion as well. at normal speed, veronica walks to the doors of the gym and peers in. the panorama of roaring students, posing jocks, and prancing cheerleaders continues to unfold in slow motion. veronica walks away from the gym.}
<L>__{exterior the front of the school day}
<A>__{veronica wearily pushes open the front door and emerges outside of the school. she closes her eyes to therapeutically bask in the sun's rays. a slight smile trembles onto her face. a strange voice kills it.}
<C>__{j.d. }
<D>__{color me impressed.}
<A>__{j.d. stands starkly in the distance before her, blood spurting from his throat onto his gunslinger coat. he painfully speaks through his assasinated vocal cords.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you really fucked me up, veronica.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(vertigo city)}
<D>__{i thought i...you..}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you've got power, veronica. power i didn't think you had. the slate is clean.}
<A>__{j.d. pulls open his coat revealing that the bomb is attached to his torso. the green light is on and the clock says 00:10..00:09.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{pretend i did blow up the school. all the schools. now that you're dead, what are you gonna do with your life?}
<A>__{veronica takes the unlit cigrette from her blazer pocket and puts it in her mouth. she then folsd her arms.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{perfecto.}
<A>__{j.d. raises his arms in a crucifixion pose as the bomb clicks to 0:00. nothing happens. an annoyed j.d. breaks out of his crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm.}
<B>__{the pep assembly}
<A>__{the sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering up and down pep assembly into chaos. wailing students pour out of the bleachers screaming less out of fear than a "whoa dude" sense of excitement.}
<B>__{the front of the school}
<A>__{veronica stands in the same position in front of the school with her arms still folded. only now her cigarette is lit and her face and clothes are blackened in ash. flames flicker in bushes behind her. veronica drags on the cigarette and turns to go inside.}
<L>__{interior the front hallway}
<A>__{veronica strolls into the school and into a hallway of howling students, some of whom are tearing down prom banners for the thrill of it. heather duke rushes up to veronica and grimaces.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{veronica, you look like hell.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{yeah, i just got back.}
<A>__{veronica tosses away the cigarette. she then grabs heather duke by the shoulders and forcibly turns her around.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.}
<A>__{veronica takes off heather duke's red ribbon and ties it around the hair of her own head. she kisses heather duke on the cheek, leaving a black stain. veronica calls off.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{hey, martha, wait up.}
<A>__{martha dunnstock dumptruck revealed to be in an electric wheelchair, brakes to a stop and looks to veronica, confused. veronica walks up beside her. martha starts up her wheelchair and accompanies veronica away into a deserted hallway.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{my date for the prom kind of flaked out on me, so i thought if you weren't doing anything that night we could go to the video store and rent some new releases or something. maybe pop some popcorn.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i'd like that.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{so would i.}
