<A>__{roland and ludlow (who, along with sarah and malcolm, is also wearing a servo light now) maneuver down a rugged hillside and come out in a flattened area. ludlow gasps, looking ahead in wonderment. malcolm breaks through the hillside's foliage a moment later. he too stares in amazement. sarah and kelly come next, then nick, then juttson. one by one, they all stop and stare.}

<D>__{god help us.}
<A>__{they're standing in a flat, sandy area lined with boulders at the sides. the flat area stretches fifty yards from side to side and as far as they can see ahead. but that's not what amazes them so. everywhere, the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons. some are huge, apatosaurs, sixty feet from head to tail tip. others are smaller, herbivores of many different kinds. the more intact skeletons lie on their sides, their ribcages arcs of pale bone. but just as many have been ripped apart, bits of carcass tossed in every direction.}

<D>__{keep moving.}
<A>__{they march on, tiny figures moving among the mountainous skeletons by the light of the full moon. roland notices one carcass in particular, a recent kill. it's an enormous hadrosaur with fresh bites taken out of it. he bends down, studying the soft earth around it for footprints. further on, malcolm looks up, noticing the bony shapes around them, which fall in heavy shadows like cell bars, seem to be changing. he turns, and his servo light shines on the bones. but they're not bones any more at all, they're pipes, the animal graveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade objects twisted, rotting machinery.}
