<A>__{the crowd applauds. alyssa shakes her head, smiling. holden pokes her.}
<C>__{singer}
<D>__{but what a lot of people don't know is that she used to harbor these delusions that she could sing. and she used to subject us to these throaty renditions of debbie gibson tunes and shit, insisting that we let her front on a few numbers. well, we didn't and she quit.. and then she got famous, the bitch.}
<P>__{(crowd laughs)}
<D>__{but she's here tonight, and i think if we all begged, or maybe offered her some x, she'd get up here and treat us to some of her vocal stylings.}

<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{alright. i should dedicate this, right?}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{this is for that special someone our there.}
<A>__{holden smiles. banky joins him. holden glances at him. banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile. the band starts playing. cross cutting begins. alyssa launches into a torchy tune. the song is extremely sexy as is alyssa who works the mic, making direct eye contact with... holden. or does she! holden is smiling, being seduced, banky rolls his eyes. beside holden, stands a pretty girl with a short haircut, who's also riveted by alyssa's performance. alyssa makes big time eye contact with somebody out there. the song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at. it's more than obvious there's a seduction going on, bur of whom! at the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but alyssa's preoccupied. she points to someone in the crowd, and curls her finger back in a 'c'mere' fashion, urging whoever it is to join her. she jumps off the stage. holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw shucks style. at that moment, the girl beside him leaps forward. banky's eyes widen. holden looks up and is suddenly taken aback. alyssa and the girl race into each other's arms and fall into a way to passionate to mean anything else kiss. holden's eyes bug. banky allows a smile to creep across his face. the crowd applauds. banky looks around, and for the first time, we get the distinct impression that this is a lesbian bar... there are a lot of chicks in this place. gay chicks. banky looks at holden and slaps him on the back.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{now that, my friend, is a..}
<P>__{(brings his fingers together, mimicing holden)}
<D>__{...shared moment}
<A>__{holden continues to stare mouth agape. alyssa and the girl continue to kiss.}
