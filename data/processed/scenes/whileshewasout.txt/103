<L>__{exterior ledge evening}
<A>__{della's been watching the scene unfold, a captive audience, attentive and terrified. slowly she tears her eyes away from the boys. she backs away from the edge and right into the sharp branch of a big old tree. the branch digs into that point in her shoulder she hurt earlier on the barbed wire. she reaches up to feel it and pulls her hand away bloody. she reaches into her coat pockets for a tissue. nothing. feels something in her pants pocket. she pulls out not a tissue but a sheet of folded paper. she unfolds it. it's tammi's drawing. the one from the beginning. the stick figure family holding hands and "mommy we love you" written in stars. della's lost in the drawing. her eyes drink in every mark and color and word. she sees that the male figure is slightly separate. that the children stick figures have frightened eyes and cling to the female. that the sky is turbulent. the stars clear and bright. the words... a tear escapes from underneath her eyelid. then another. a sob. she might never see her kids again. another sob. she heaves with the release of emotion. more tears escape. another sob. she tries to bite it back. wills herself to stop. finds that rage takes sorrow's place. rage and self recrimination. goddamit! she's gonna be raped and killed because of some stupid note! and god knows what will become of the kids. kenneth always told her she had a temper. that she reacts without thinking of the consequences. this time the bastard was right. she looks again at the picture. chuckie's voice booms out into the night.}

<A>__{she folds the picture up carefully and puts it back in her pocket. della edges further into the trees and disappears into the darkness. there's rustling in the darkness. tomas pushes through the edge of the trees, making animal calls with his right hand curled around his mouth. the flashlight illuminates him from behind. chuckie follows him operating the light in a mockery of classic noir style. vinh slouches behind them. tomas heads along the ledge, straight past the spot where della stood only moments before. tomas doubles back. thomas stops, sniffs.}
