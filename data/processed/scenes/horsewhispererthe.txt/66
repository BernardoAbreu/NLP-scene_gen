<D>__{grace. what are you doing?}
<A>__{not looking up, grace speaks in a hollow voice.}

<D>__{i think we should. it's not fair to let him suffer. he's not much use anymore. he'd hate living like that.}

<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i mean, i'm not much use anymore. why can't they be compassionate to me?}
<A>__{what frightens annie most is the calm and apathy in grace's voice. she's surrendering... annie, for the first time in a long time, feels she's losing control.}
