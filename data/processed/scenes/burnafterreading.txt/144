<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's right, don't sweat the small stuff...}
<A>__{linda chimes in: linda and harry}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{... and it's all small stuff.}
<A>__{harry reaches for linda and she slides closer. he puts an arm around her.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{this is where we first met. remember?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{of course i do.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you never know what the important days are, until... until, um...}
<A>__{the thought drifts away as his gaze fixes on something. with his look still fixed:}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{... i told myself i was gonna stop being paranoid, but... is that guy looking at us?}
<A>__{linda follows his look. on a bench a short distance away a middle aged man with aviator glasses and hair plugs is staring at them.}
<C>__{linda}
<P>__{(hastily)}
<D>__{no, no.}
<A>__{a slightly overweight woman stops tentatively in front of the man in the aviator glasses and they start to talk. linda turns to harry.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{... have you found out anything about chad?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{nothing yet, i've made a couple calls. i don't think it'll take long.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh yeah, there are so many data bases now it's a joke...}
<A>__{relaxing now that he sees the man in aviator glasses engaged in conversation, harry warms to his theme.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{... back when i was in pp there was still some art to finding people. not any more. and now with the cell phones? pretty soon they're gonna know where everyone is. everyone. at any given moment. i mean it's almost the reality now. you would be amazed.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{did he when you left the jamba juice did chad say anything about where he might be going?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{oh, i know where he was going.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{a residence in alexandria. on hillsboro drive.}
<A>__{harry has stopped chewing. he is staring at her. linda feels obliged to fill the silence.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{... 2055 hillsboro.}
<A>__{harry stares. linda doesn't know what to make of his fixed stare.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{... it's, um. the residence of a guy named osbourne cox.}
<A>__{harry is beginning to look sick. a long silence. then, quietly:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{now linda stares, unsure of what to make of the question.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{... who are you?}
<A>__{linda's eyes widen. she is a little frightened. people nearby turn to look. it is a scene.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{... who do you work for?}
<A>__{harry reaches up. he grabs her by the shoulders and shakes.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{... who are you? really?}
<A>__{linda is at sea. she answers in a small voice:}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i'm ... just ... linda litzke.}
<A>__{harry stares at her. a long beat. he leaps to his feet and looks around in a panic. his point of view, sweeping the park. nearby, the man with plugs, though talking with his date, is looking at him again. farther away, a man sits in a curbside sedan. watching? hard to say. harry turns and runs. linda gapes.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{... harry!}
