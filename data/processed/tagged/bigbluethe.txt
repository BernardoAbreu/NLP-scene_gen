<T>__{credit sequence:}
<A>__{the image is in black and white. the sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant shadows on the sea. a little boy around 8 years old tanned from head to toe sprints along the cliffs, scrambles from one rock to another with amazing agility. in one hand, he carries a transparent plastic bag. in the other, a net bag containing flippers, mask, pants and sweater. the only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit obvious hand me downs way too big. he tugs on them as he goes, holding them up... until they slide again... as he leaps again... and pulls them up... the little boy is jacques mayol. end credits.}
<L>__{exterior greek island sunset}
<A>__{jacques reaches a ledge jutting out over a deserted cove. he spits in his mask... expertly spreads the spit with a finger... locks his feet into the flippers... and dives. he surfaces a long way out... adjusts his mask... and swims away from shore.}
<B>__{in open sea}
<A>__{the boy stops swimming starts to gulp air sucks it in oxygenating his blood in a series of deep rapid breaths almost hyperventilating, almost alarming if we've never seen this before. his gaze is glued to the ocean floor. clear clear water.}
<L>__{40 feet deep. and intensely blue.}
<A>__{suddenly, he catches his breath and dives into the blue.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{jacques touches bottom. clamps his legs around a rock to hold himself down. unhurried, thoroughly at home, 40 feet under... he opens the plastic bag. a huge speckled moray eel appears in a hole in the rock, slithers toward him. the carnivore's jaws are bigger than the boy's head. the boy smiles at him. pulls a piece of raw meat out of his bag and holds it out. the eel takes the morsel delicately and slithers back into his hole. gravely, jacques takes another morsel out of the bag.}
<L>__{exterior village dusk}
<A>__{jacques walks up a steep road bordering the port, almost dry now. two boys about his age run up the streets; call out, catch up with him and gesture toward the port.}

<A>__{the little boys tug jacques to the end of the pier and point to something in the water.}

<D>__{look! right there! it's shining!}

<C>__{first boy}
<D>__{i found it.}

<A>__{camera pans and we see a middle aged priest loading supplies into a small boat. he stops to watch the children's negotiations. little jacques is putting his flippers on.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{ok. i will get it, but no fighting, all right?}
<A>__{the two boys nod as they point to the coin.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{we'll split it.}
<C>__{first boy}
<D>__{you can't split a coin. that's stupid.}
<C>__{second boy}
<D>__{he's right. you're stupid.}
<A>__{the pope smiles.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{then we'll buy something and split that.}

<D>__{i don't want a ferrari... what is it?}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(interrupting them)}
<D>__{maybe a little radio.}
<A>__{the two boys look at each other.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{well. we'll decide later. the light is going.}
<C>__{second boy}
<D>__{i get the radio from after school, until midnight.}
<C>__{first boy}
<D>__{since when do you stay up until midnight?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{all right, all right... can i concentrate? and you can stop pointing. i've seen it.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{i've seen it too.}
<A>__{the voice is enzo's. another young boy wearing little round glasses.}
<C>__{first boy}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{shit, it's the italian!}
<A>__{he is slightly older than jacques but he is taller. enzo is with roberto, his younger brother, the only one allowed to carry his flippers. five kids are behind him.}

<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(cool)}
<D>__{fine!}

<P>__{(to his brother)}
<D>__{roberto, mio palmo!}
<A>__{roberto who has already started to moisten his big brother's gear in the water, holds a pair of dripping flippers and a glistening mask. the pope watches the scene with obvious pleasure.}

<D>__{1... 2... 3...}
<A>__{the kids all walk over to the edge of the pier. a few feet away, jacques takes off his flippers.}
<C>__{roberto}
<D>__{4... 5... 6...}
<A>__{enzo bursts out of the water, the coin in his hand. the children cheer and clap. roberto rushes to catch the equipment that comes flying at him, piece by piece. enzo walks over to jacques.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(showing him the coin)}
<D>__{who's is it now? you saw it but i dove for it!}
<A>__{jacques doesn't answer. enzo smiles and slowly puts the coin in his pocket. he pulls it out again and waves it under jacques' nose.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(without turning around)}
<D>__{roberto? how long?}
<C>__{roberto}
<D>__{six seconds.}
<A>__{enzo looks at jacques for a while.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{i will throw it back into the water. you dive and if you do less than six, it's yours.}
<A>__{jacques doesn't say anything, then finally shakes his head, negatively. enzo smiles, taps him on the shoulder.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{brava!}
<A>__{the first boy finally sums up his courage to speak.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(timidly)}
<D>__{enzo? i saw the coin first... we split?}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you can't split a coin, stupid.}
<A>__{enzo laughing, sticks the coin in his pocket and leaves the pier with his gang. the pope smiles and pulls a coin from his pocket. with his flippers dangling from one hand, jacques sadly stares out at the sea. the pope calls him over.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{jacques... come, look.}
<A>__{jacques goes over to him, sees where he is pointing, the faint gleam of the coin underwater.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{is it a coin shining down there?}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(overjoyed)}
<D>__{it is. it's a coin! i will get it for you, father!}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{it'll be for the poor.}
<A>__{jacques, intent on the coin's glimmer, quickly slips on his fins, prepares his mask. he swims in the water like a fish, goes directly to the coin. scoops it up, brings it to the surface. he breaks water, waves the coin, looks for the priest and sees he is no longer there.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{padre?}
<A>__{he looks at the ancient impression on the coin "boy on a dolphin".}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{on jacques underwater he's swimming near the spot where he fed the moray eel. he senses something behind him and turns around. he sees a dolphin, still and silent, floating vertically. it seems to be watching him. the surprise is such that jacques is in a panic, leaps up to the surface... on jacques in bed he bolts upright, as if suddenly awakening from a dream.}
<L>__{interior room on jacques' father dark}
<A>__{a burly man, around fifty, crosses the room in the shadows and throws open the shutters with a bang. sunlight pours in. he walks over to jacques' bed in the one room house, and runs his hand through his hair.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{... come on, time to get up, jacques!}
<A>__{jacques rubs his eyes. his father walks over to a pile of blankets on the floor, on the other side of the room. he gives the pile a kick.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(screaming at the top of his lungs)}
<D>__{louis, wake up!}
<A>__{he uncovers a kettle on the fire and ladles up a big bowl of soup for jacques. a fifty year old man pokes his head out from under the pile of blankets. it's uncle louis, who is having a very hard time, waking up.}
<L>__{exterior house day}
<A>__{jacques bursts out of the house, running. diving gear under his arm. a piece of buttered bread in his mouth. he catches up with his father and uncle louis. they're on a path winding down to the port. jacques slows down abruptly. tries to imitate their stride. the weather is balmy and the sea lies before them, peaceful and blue.}
<L>__{exterior sea day}
<A>__{their boat on the water. the chug of its engine echoes off the cliffs. a few gulls drawn by the sound skim the waves of its wake.}
<L>__{exterior boat day}
<A>__{on board. jacques' father checks the antique air pump. jacques polishes the enormous copper diver's helmet and lays out the rest of an old fashioned deep sea diver's suit. at the foot of an old monastery another boat passes. the priest is in it. jacques' father and louis take off their caps. jacques takes the gold coin out of his pocket. the pope nods to jacques. his father looks over at him without understanding. the child quickly puts the coin back in his pocket.}
<L>__{exterior boat day}
<A>__{louis casts anchor. a few feet away, siting on a rock, the kid with little round glasses is fishing. he turns around to the boat. jacques smiles and waves at him. enzo waves back, obviously disturbed in his fishing session.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{jacques, come help me.}
<A>__{jacques helps his father into the diver's suit. the burly man struggles into a pair of weighted lead shoes. he seems sluggish and tired. jacques watches worriedly. he has a weird feeling.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{you shouldn't dive everyday, papa.}
<C>__{uncle louis}
<D>__{then you shouldn't eat everyday, jacques.}
<A>__{his father catches him fondly by the scruff of the neck.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(winks at him)}
<D>__{don't worry. when i'm tired down there, the mermaids help me out.}
<A>__{father and son smile at each other. then his father puts the helmet on. jacques joins louis at the pump. the heavy diver's suit disappears slowly underwater. the gleaming copper helmet is the last thing to slide out of sight. jacques and louis work the pump. regular, steady motions to maintain the flow of air.}
<C>__{uncle louis}
<P>__{(to jacques)}
<D>__{hey! have you ever seen a mermaid?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{they keep on pumping for a while, then...}
<C>__{uncle louis}
<D>__{i've seen them.}
<A>__{uncle louis goes on. jacques doesn't budge.}
<C>__{uncle louis}
<D>__{don't you want to know where?}
<A>__{jacques looks at the bottom to watch his father. he doesn't answer. underwater jacques' father he moves along slowly in his cumbersome diving suit. he is working the top of a rock outcrop on the sea floor. he sees a sponge, hooks it; puts it in a bag that's attached to a life line from the boat fastened to his waist. he moves on.}
<L>__{interior boat jacques and louis pumping}
<A>__{they keep up the rhythm. sitting on a rock at a distance, enzo watches them. uncle louis is bored stiff.}
<C>__{uncle louis}
<D>__{why don't you ask me?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{uncle louis}
<D>__{where i saw the mermaids?! why don't you ever ask any question? i'm always the one asking the question! we're sitting here like two stones and i'm taking to myself. ask me something, goddamnit!}
<A>__{jacques calmly looks over at him, slows down his pumping and almost serenely asks him:}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(in a completely flat tone)}
<D>__{why did my mother leave?}
<A>__{uncle louis seems disturbed by the question. a beat.}
<C>__{uncle louis}
<P>__{(ill at ease)}
<D>__{come on now, pump!}
<A>__{underwater jacques' father he is walking with difficulty at the bottom. his bag is full of sponges. he seems to be having trouble breathing.}
<L>__{exterior boat jacques and louis}
<A>__{jacques and louis are pumping silently. uncle louis feels obliged to answer jacques' question. uncle louis finally breaks the silence and explains:}
<C>__{uncle louis}
<D>__{your mother didn't leave. she went back to america, that's all. it's her home. she's allergic to this island. she likes refrigerators and machines that clean the floor... so one day she left. woman are like that, unpredictable, like the sea.}
<A>__{they haven't been paying attention to the bubbles gushing at the surface. the air hose is being pulled down in a very worrisome way.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(with a slight grin)}
<D>__{so where did you see mermaids?}
<A>__{uncle louis smiles.}
<C>__{uncle louis}
<D>__{in the bars in athens!}
<A>__{very pleased with himself, uncle louis burst out laughing. jacques shyly shrugs his shoulders. the air hose is suddenly yanked down. jacques immediately sees all the bubbles. he is white as a sheet. jacques rushes to the side of the boat and starts yelling down at his father. he grabs the life line and starts pulling at it hysterically. the air hose snaps and starts flying around like some crazy snake. jacques tries to jump overboard. uncle louis catches hold of his foot at the last second. jacques is slapping the water with his hands, trying to go down but uncle louis won't let him. jacques is yelling desperately. enzo is now standing on his rock, watching the scene, horrified. the sea now looks as if it were boiling. uncle louis grabs hold of jacques and hugs him in his arms. standing on his rock, enzo is now crying desperately.}

<L>__{interior restaurant day}
<A>__{alfredo skips in. he is panting, covered in sweat. his panic is palpable. the whole room watches him approach a long table where a large family is having a birthday party for a very old lady. he has to stop a second and catch his breath before he can get the words out. then leans over and whispers in the ear of a great big man around 30 built like a bull, wearing little round glasses. the man listens, then stiffens.}
<L>__{exterior harbor construction site day}
<A>__{a beat up fiat, towing an equally beat up trailer, stops. enzo unfolds out of the driver's seat, like a circus clown emerging from a toy car. the construction supervisor, an american, wearing a three piece suit, hurries over to him. enzo has already started undressing. roberto unloads the diving gear from the trailer.}

<D>__{okay. you tell me. how much would you say the man's life is worth?}
<A>__{extremely uncomfortable, the supervisor doesn't answer.}

<L>__{exterior unfinished pier enzo}
<A>__{he's at the end of the pier, his feet dangling in the muddy water of the port. a few feet away a pump sends air hissing through a rubber tube to the diver trapped below. enzo inhales steadily, his chest heaving like a bellow. he carefully puts his spectacles inside his shoes, dons his flippers, etc., with his usual flair of suspense. behind him the supervisor and other construction workers watch expectantly. roberto heaves a stone weight into the bay, a cable attached to it plays out from a drum on the pier. enzo ignoring everyone, grabs the ordinary tire jack, flip flops over to the now taut cable, the stone has hit bottom. he takes a deep breath and dives into the bay. underwater wreck enzo dives down a chimney of muck. picks his way over and around every hazard, until he reaches the diver, trapped under a huge piece of debris. he pats his shoulder to comfort him, he then inserts the tire jack under a piece of concrete... and, as if he were changing a tire, begins to pump the handle... slowly, in a swirl of mud and water, the chunk of debris rises off the diver's leg.}
<L>__{exterior construction site day}
<A>__{everyone is staring at the water silently, suspensefully. the supervisor has his checkbook in hand, but has completely forgotten it, intent upon what's going on underwater. roberto taps him on the shoulder.}

<D>__{since we have a little time, what do you say you write that check?}
<A>__{underwater wreck enzo cuts the cables tangled around the diver's torso. then he takes off his flippers, plants his bare feet on the concrete, grabs the diver by the shoulders and pulls him free. the diver drops the air tube and climbs as quickly as possible toward the surface.}

<A>__{suddenly, enzo appears, burst out of the water, holding his flippers up in the air like a trophy. the onlookers cheer, help him out of the water, slapping him on the back. enzo tosses the jack and his flippers to roberto. impassive and silent, he slips his arms into the prize fighter's robe that roberto holds out for him, walks solemnly back to his car. roberto takes the check and walks over to the car. enzo bends down into the car and opens the roof.}

<A>__{the car rushes off. in the distance we see a police (carabinieri) car and an old fire engine rolling in the direction of the construction site. inside fiat driving away enzo's car drives past them. enzo looks at roberto out of the corner of his eye, then suddenly explodes with joy.}

<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{yes, of course. lots of questions.}
<A>__{jacques is satisfied with his answer. he thinks that the subject is closed. they eat silently for a moment. enzo watches him. then:}

<D>__{well, what are they?}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(giving up)}
<D>__{i'm sorry... i don't know how to ask the questions.}

<P>__{(his voice changes)}
<D>__{well, after you left amorgos, i went back to italy and joined the navy. so you now have in front of you captain molinari, who's been on leave of absence for the past 14 years...}

<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{me neither, 'cause of my mother. she's a curse, my mamma, a tornado. stubborn as a mule! i was engaged... for a week. after that, mamma was so mad, i tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.}

<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{so, not married. well, good for you. you play the field, like me. a girl in every port, huh?}

<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(shakes his head negatively)}
<D>__{yes... maybe... i don't know. i don't like competitions... it ruins the fun. don't you think?}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(with a faint smile)}
<D>__{i guess... but you know... i'm american and i've mostly been taught to be competitive... there's always pleasure of being the best?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... you see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it. it's a feeling... i don't know how to say this... voluptuous?}
