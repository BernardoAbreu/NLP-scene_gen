<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{the court bailiff nods, takes the bible from elena's hands. she's dressed in the closest thing to a modest suit she has in her wardrobe; a low cut jacket and tiny miniskirt... the courtroom is packed with journalists, tv cameras and nosey neighbors. everyone wants a piece of this story. at the defendant's table, jay, slick once more in armani, watches theo approach the witness box with a new found confidence. sitting in the front row of the public gallery, marie is riveted on the action. at the back of the courtroom, kristen fidgets nervously beside morrison as theo steps up, ready to question the newly compliant star witness in this sensational rape trial...}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{it's your assertion that my client, mr. clifford forcibly sexually assaulted you on the night of the 25th. is that true?}
<A>__{a hushed silence. marie, jay, theo all wait expectantly...}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{is that what you say happened?}
<A>__{elena clears her throat.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{he... he didn't...}
<A>__{a collective intake of breath from the crowd.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{....just sexually assault me.}
<A>__{theo's balls shrink instantly.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{what...did you just say?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{he didn't just sexually assault me. he threatened to kill me if i told anyone...}
<A>__{the court is on the verge of erupting into anarchy. theo's reeling, caught off guard, stumbling over his words, trying to give the girl one last chance to make good on her promise.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{isn't it true that you were inebriated during the assault, that it may not in fact have been mr. clifford...or anyone?}
<A>__{a smirking meese doesn't even bother to stand up.}
<C>__{d.a. meese}
<D>__{objection. leading the witness.}
<C>__{judge wilcox}
<D>__{sustained. council will please rephrase the question.}
<A>__{theo's stumped. his eyes plead with elena to take the ball and run with it. she does. unfortunately it's to the wrong end zone.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i was messed up, alright. in fact, only two things i remember. one was that bastard jay clifford taping me with that goddamn video camera while he violated me. the other was what he whispered in my ear, right before i blacked out...}
<A>__{she pauses, for emphasis. judge, jury, gallery, press corps, the town of blue bay, the state of florida hangs on her every word...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{he said, "you won't remember, but you'll never forget."}
<A>__{that's it. the court goes berserk, flashbulbs exploding, along with the veins in jay's head. kristen's reeling from shock...}
<C>__{kristen}
<P>__{(to morrison)}
<D>__{what did she just say?}
<A>__{marie leaps to her feet, screams...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{lying bitch!}
<A>__{marie has to be restrained, trying to break through the crowds to claw elena's tear stained eyes out...}
