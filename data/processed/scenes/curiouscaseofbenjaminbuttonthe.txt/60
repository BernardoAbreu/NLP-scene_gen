<A>__{we see an abstract black and white drawing. and we hear a woman's voice...}
<C>__{a woman's }
<D>__{this is the picture of old man kangaroo at five in the afternoon...}
<A>__{an old finger comes in pointing to a drawing. we see benjamin and daisy, sitting close together on a sofa, and daisy's grandmother, arm encircling them, is reading to them from rudyard kipling's "just so stories."}
<C>__{grandma fuller}
<D>__{you can tell it's late, because of the shadow here...}
<A>__{benjamin and daisy sitting rapt while she finishes reading to them...}
<C>__{grandma fuller }
<D>__{it's the time old man kangaroo got his beautiful hind legs just as... i hope i'm saying this right... just as big god ngog had promised. you can see that it's five o'clock, because big god ngog's pet tame clock says so.}
<P>__{(finishing) isn't that something?}
<A>__{both daisy and benjamin, thrilled, say: "again. read it again."}
<C>__{grandma fuller }
<D>__{alright, once more... but afterwards (forgetting benjamin's age) both of you must promise to go to bed...}
<A>__{they both "i promise..." and as she starts to read all over again...}
