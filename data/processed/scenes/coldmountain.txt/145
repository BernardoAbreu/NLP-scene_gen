<L>__{interior old mill, cold mountain. christmas day. night}
<A>__{the music continues. stobrod is playing the fiddle, his bowing hand still lightly taped and a fingerless mitten covering it. they're in the abandoned mill, a derelict space, which has been cheered up with some rudimentary christmas decorations. ada, ruby and sally swanger, her hair now almost completely white. some token presents. pangle is picking at a banjo, his grin infectious, and a third player, georgia, with a harmonica. as they play:}
<C>__{pangle}
<P>__{(of sally)}
<D>__{she don't speak.}
<C>__{stobrod}
<D>__{she can't speak. i told you.}
<C>__{pangle}
<P>__{(smiles at sally)}
<D>__{is she feeble then?}
<C>__{stobrod}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(to sally)}
<D>__{don't mind him.}
<P>__{(to ruby)}
<D>__{hey ruby: what about this?}
<A>__{he starts the tune of wayfaring stranger. ruby groans.}
<C>__{stobrod}
<D>__{don't make that face you listen: c'mon georgia...}
<A>__{and he starts up again, but this time georgia begins to sing. he's like a pale angel and sings with a soft, true voice. ruby finds herself taken by this boy's voice and by stobrod's extraordinary invention as he takes the tune off on a wild journey. ruby sits next to ada, fiddles with her bracelets, slips one from ada's wrist and slides it over her own.}
