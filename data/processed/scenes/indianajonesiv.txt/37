<L>__{exterior zoological compound}
<A>__{dark. silent. many of the animals are asleep in their cages. a security guard keeps watch on the compound. he stands outside of the metal gates. there is a sudden sound. the guard turns. the figures of three men stand before him. in the shadows. the nervous guard places a hand on his holster.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{who's there?...}
<A>__{we hear a mechanical creak. a man's leather gloved hand extends from the shadows. the hand's finger is pointed at the security guard. close up: various animals the sound of rapid machine gun fire echoes throughout the camp! camera records the animal's shocked reactions!}
<B>__{the security guard}
<A>__{lies on the ground. dead. his body riddled with bullets. the shiny, black boots of the three men pass his body. we notice that one of the boot's shoelaces are untied.}

<A>__{stares into the dark night. fear covers his face. he is seated inside of his cage. a candle flickers beside him. tyki's hands rest on the beautiful tapestry. tyki listens. he hears footsteps. coming toward his cage. tyki reaches to his side. he grabs a stone dagger. suddenly, a lood gonshot! the splintered lock from tyki's cage goes spinning across the floor. the cage door creaks open. gutterbuhg stands in the doorway. two nazi soldiers, helmut and klace (who we met earlier), are beside him. gutterbuhg smiles. his stiff right arm extends from his side. his leather gloved index finger is pointing ahead. tyki growls at the nazis. he stands. raising the stone dagger over his}

<A>__{gutterbuhg's finger begins to rapidly fire bullets! his mechanical arm is actually a a maceine gun! the bullets tear through tyki's tapestry. they make a crooked, tattered line through the beautifol work. destroying it. a terrified tyki watches. gutterbuhg stops shooting. he removes the empty cartridge from a slot in his mechanical arm, and replaces it with another. he points the deadly finger at tyki. a trembling tyki drops the dagger. the three nazis walk toward the helpless pygmy.}
