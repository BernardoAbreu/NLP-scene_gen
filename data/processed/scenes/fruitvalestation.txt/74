<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i stole it.}
<A>__{oscar looks at him like he is crazy.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{yeah man, i told you, i had nothing. i used to be good with credit cards if you know what i mean. i wouldn't go that route if i were you though man.}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{yeah, i'm straight off that.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah. i ended up getting locked up for a bit. my wife had to sell the ring to bail me out. got my business going about a year after i got out, and got her the one she wears now.}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{what you do?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i own a web design company. we do a lot of business with companies in the valley.}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{hit me up if you ever need anything man. but about that ring bro, it doesn't matter. if she loves you, any ring'll do.}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{what about the wedding though?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{shit man. find whoever's got the nicest backyard. tell all your boys over there to each bring a dish.}
<A>__{oscar laughs at this. the three girls, sophina, vanessa, and steph make their way out of the store laughing like best friends. sammy follows them and closes the door.}
<C>__{steph}
<D>__{okay.}
<P>__{(to sophina and vanessa)}
<D>__{it was nice meeting you guys.}
