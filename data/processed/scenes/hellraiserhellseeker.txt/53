<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{cleaned up now trevor carefully makes his way back to tawny's apartment. he tries the door. it's locked. this can't be right. he jiggles the door knob violently, then finally kicks the door. suddenly tawny answers the door, looking utterly pissed off. though still in goth mode, she's dressed much more conservatively now.}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{tawny... i you're }
<A>__{trevor goes to embrace her. she shrinks back, startled.}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{whoa, i have serious space issues, dude. what do you want?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...}
<C>__{tawny}
<P>__{(a look of recognition)}
<D>__{hey you're the guy from down the hall.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{come on, quit fucking around. listen it's about... what we did together last night.}
<C>__{tawny}
<P>__{(utterly shocked)}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{a very deep voice comes from somewhere behind her.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{who the fuck is that?}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{it's that guy from down the hall. he thinks we did something with him last night.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{who's who's in there with you...?}
<A>__{tawny looks aghast.}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{are you cracking up or something?}
<A>__{suddenly an enormous brute of a man, wide as he is tall enters the doorway. he's wearing a black tee, black jeans and, trevor can't help notice, black nail polish... on fingers and toes. obviously tawny's significant other.}
<C>__{brute}
<D>__{what can we do for you, chief?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i... who are you?}
<A>__{brute takes a sideward step through the doorway, forcing trevor back two steps.}
<C>__{brute}
<D>__{you know tawny, you better know me, pal.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{okay. i don't want any trouble. i was mistaken... i will see you later.}
<C>__{brute}
<D>__{much.}
<A>__{trevor turns and hurries off. brute turns to tawny who shrugs and makes a twirly motion at her temple. the two go back into her apartment.}
