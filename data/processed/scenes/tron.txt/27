<A>__{on top of the building. several technicians are at hand, and as the helicopter touches down, they rush out to secure it.}
<L>__{interior dillinger's office conference room night}
<A>__{a huge wall sized plate glass window shows a view of the grid like suburban landscape. dillinger stands behind a table. we see that the entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal. his fingers punch out a code on the touch sensitive keyboard and we see printed out on the screen: request: access to master control program, user code 00 dillinger. password: master. the computer's screen clears, and the master control program addresses dillinger, simultaneously speaking in a human sound voice through a pair of studio quality stereo speakers and printing out its words on the computer screen, the mcp's voice is the same as that of the "bad cop" who grilled clu, but its tone is now that of a compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient.}

<C>__{mcp}
<D>__{i would if i could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. meanwhile...}
<C>__{dillinger}
<D>__{meanwhile, he might find it.}
<C>__{mcp}
<D>__{i'm afraid so. i spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.}
<C>__{dillinger}
<D>__{i think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. just to be safe.}
<C>__{mcp}
<D>__{there's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.}
<C>__{dillinger}
<D>__{cute.}
