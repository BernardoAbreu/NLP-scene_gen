<A>__{travis and iris are having late breakfast at a middle class east side coffee shop. it is about 1:30 p.m. iris is dressed more sensibly, wearing jeans and a maroon sweater. her face is freshly washed and her hair combed out. seen this way, iris looks no different than any young girl in the big city. other patrons of the coffee shop most likely assume she is having lunch with her big brother. they are both having an all american breakfast: ham and eggs, large glasses of orange juice, coffee. outside here environment, iris seems the more pathetic. she seems unsure, schizy, unable to hold a subject for more than thirty seconds. her gestures are too broad, her voice too mannered. we sympathize with travis' paternal respect. this girl is in trouble.}
