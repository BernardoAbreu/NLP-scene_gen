<B>__{close on picard}
<A>__{being led through a darkened hallway. he is wearing a blindfold. off screen hands tug and pull at him, leading him forward down the hall. he's lost and confused, unsure where he is or what's going on. he tries to resist, but can't... the hands keep pulling at him... he is finally brought out into a larger room, dark. the hands release him and he stands alone. he takes a beat and tries to take control of the situation.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{what's going on? where am i?}
<A>__{two hands reach into frame from off screen and remove the blindfold... picard's pov the blindfold drops, revealing a blurry kaleidoscope of colors and shapes...}
<B>__{on picard}
<A>__{as he blinks and tries to focus... picard's pov as the room comes into focus. the first thing we see is an enormous, gaily decorated christmas tree sparkling with hundreds of lights.}
<B>__{reveal the room}
<A>__{a 24th century french living room. it is beautifully decorated with lights, ornaments, holly. brightly wrapped presents are clustered beneath the christmas tree. there are five children standing and sitting in the room, all looking at picard with bright, smiling faces, waiting for him to say something. picard stares at the scene for a moment, unsure how to react. then we hear the woman's voice again, and we move to reveal an attractive woman in her forties standing next to picard.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{go on... say something. they're waiting.}
<A>__{picard is stunned.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i... don't know what to say...}
<A>__{one of the children, a young girl, speaks up.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{say merry christmas, papa!}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(in a daze)}
<D>__{merry... christmas...}
<A>__{the children break out into applause. the woman kisses him on the cheek, then steers him to a large, overstuffed chair. picard sits down and the children starts handing out presents with much laughter and chatting.}
<C>__{children}
<D>__{this one's for you... where's mine?... i hope this is the book i asked for... take this one to papa...}
<A>__{as the activity swirls around him, picard begins to feel an immense sense of satisfaction and happiness. it's like a drug an overwhelming feeling of joy and contentment fills picard. it's a wondrous experience. he settles back in the chair and a smile spreads across his face. for reasons he cannot name and does not even want to understand at the moment, he is very, very happy.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(to picard)}
<D>__{isn't the tree beautiful, papa?}
<A>__{picard answers as if it were the most natural thing in the world.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{oh yes... yes, it's astonishingly beautiful. all of it.}
<A>__{all of the children now crowd around the chair with a single large gift and hand it to picard. one of the younger boys speaks up.}
<C>__{young boy}
<D>__{this is from all of us.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{thank you... i can't imagine what it is.}
<A>__{picard tears open the box and pulls out a 19th century sextant an old fashioned nautical navigational instrument. it's a beautiful piece with polished and gleaming brass.}
<C>__{young boy}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{it's a sack tent!}
<A>__{picard eyes it with delight.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you mean a sextant. and it's a handsome one at that... from about eighteen twenty, i'd say. wherever did you find it?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{it's a secret.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{oh, a secret... well, that makes it a doubly special gift. thank you... thank you all...}
<A>__{the children react with pleasure. they cluster around him, showering him with hugs and kisses.}
<C>__{children}
<D>__{merry christmas, papa... i love you, father... etc.}
<A>__{picard is covered in a blanket of love and affection. the children pull back and return to their own presents. there is a swirl of activity and commotion as a warm and heartfelt christmas morning is played out.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(to picard)}
<D>__{i will go get dinner ready. they'll be starving in a minute.}
<A>__{picard nods as the woman exits the room. he looks around the scene, utterly happy, utterly content. the children continue to chatter and laugh among themselves as picard's eye falls on the glorious christmas tree. he can't help but smile as he looks over the ornaments and decorations... picard's pov of the sparkling lights and ornaments a swirl of color and light.}
<B>__{picard}
<A>__{his eye is caught by something in particular on the tree. he leans forward slightly and stares at it. picard's pov (vfx p) his eye has been caught by an ornament near the top of the tree. it is a large and beautiful glass ball with a tiny light at the center in the shape of a star. as picard watches, the star suddenly goes out... and it radiates a shimmering light effect that expands outward into the glass sphere. it's a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is reminiscent of the star going out, as seen earlier in the movie. but this is just coincidence. this is the way the ornament was designed and it's simply one of many ornaments on the tree.}
<B>__{picard}
<A>__{reacts. the image of the ornament has touched a nerve within him somewhere. it has reminded him of something he'd nearly forgotten a discordant note in an otherwise wondrous and magical scene. he frowns, the reverie momentarily disrupted. but he tries to push it aside, not wanting the spell to be broken. he stands and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby window it's snowing and the beautiful image of snow soothes him for a moment. then he reacts to something. picard's pov (vfx p) reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the ornament it's still blinking. picard now realizes that this image is not going to go away... he can't hide from it.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{no... this isn't right... this can't be real...}
<C>__{guinan's voice}
<D>__{it's as real as you want it to be.}
<A>__{picard turns to see guinan (vfx p) standing before him. she is wearing the same outfit seen in the beginning of the movie on the enterprise b. as they talk, the children and the woman continue to move about their business as if picard and guinan aren't there. picard is stunned.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{guinan... what's going on? where am i?}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{you're in the nexus.}
<A>__{picard looks around.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{this... is the nexus?}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{for you. this is where you wanted to be...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{but i never had a wife, children, a home like this...}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{enjoy them, jean luc...}
<A>__{picard tries to make sense of it he focuses on guinan.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{guinan, what are you doing here? i thought you were on the enterprise.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{i am on the enterprise...i am also here.}
<P>__{(off his puzzled look)}
<D>__{think of me as... an "echo" of the person you know... a part of her she left behind...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{left behind...?}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{when the enterprise b beamed us off the lakul, we were partially in the nexus. the transporters locked on to us... but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{soran...?}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{all of us.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{where is he now?}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{wherever he wanted to be...}
<A>__{guinan smiles at him.}
<C>__{boy's voice}
<D>__{papa, help me build my castle!}
<A>__{picard glances over at the boy, who is building a play castle out of the 24th century equivalent of "lego". for a moment, picard is tempted to drift back to the warm embrace of the fantasy...}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(to boy)}
<D>__{in a few minutes...}
<A>__{picard looks around at the children... the lure to stay here becoming more powerful.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(continuing, awed, to guinan)}
<D>__{these are my children... my children...}
<C>__{guinan}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{yeah. they're great, aren't they? you can go back and see them born... go forward and see your grandchildren... time has no meaning here.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{dinner's ready! let's go!}
<A>__{there's a general rush toward the adjacent dining room. the youngest boy looks at picard, goes over to him and takes his hand.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{papa... are you coming?}
<A>__{picard looks down into the face of his child. his heart swells, the temptation to stay here and live this out is profound. almost in a trance, he takes a few steps with the child toward the dining room... his eye is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a moment... torn between the two images. and then, in one of the most difficult moments of his life, he bends down to the child...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{go on... go on without me...}
<A>__{the boy looks at him quizzically for a moment, then obeys his father and dashes off toward the dining room to join the others. picard straightens up and tries to steel his voice.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{guinan... can i leave the nexus?}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{why would you want to leave?}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(insistent)}
<D>__{can i?}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{yes... where would you go?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{i told you, time has no meaning here. if you leave, you can go anywhere... any time.}
<A>__{picard realizes the opportunity before him.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i know exactly where i want to go... and when. back to that mountaintop on veridian three... before soran put out the star. i have to stop him.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{what makes you think things will be any different this time?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you're right. i will need help.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{guinan, will you come back with me? together, we could }
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{i can't leave. i'm already there, remember?}
<A>__{picard looks crestfallen for a moment. guinan gives him an enigmatic smile.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{i know just the guy.}
<A>__{suddenly there's the cry of a hawk from offscreen. picard turns at the sound }
