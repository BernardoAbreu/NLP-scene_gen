<A>__{shelly opens the door to his cadillac. climbs behind the wheel. his keys are already waiting in the ignition. who's gonna steal shelly kaplow's car, right? shelly doesn't start her up. he just leans back in his seat, emits a deep sigh. he glances up at the rearview mirror. catches sight of a silhouette in the back.}

<D>__{get down on your knees. both of you.}
