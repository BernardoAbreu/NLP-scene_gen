<A>__{the fellowship are asleep on their beds. gimli is snoring loudly. close on: bare feet tread soundlessly across the lawn. close on: frodo's eyes flicker open...as if by instinct. galadriel, her white dress glowing in the moonlight, glances at him. frodo follows her...as if drawn by an invisible force.}

<L>__{exterior galadriels glade, lorthlorien night}
<A>__{upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits a shallow silver basin. galadriel leads frodo into the small glade.}
<C>__{galadriel}
<D>__{will you look into the mirror? frodo looks with apprehension at the silver basin.}
<C>__{frodo}
<P>__{(warily)}
<D>__{what will i see?}
<A>__{galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug...a glow rises from the water.}
<C>__{galadriel}
<D>__{even the wisest cannot tell for the mirror shows many things...things that were ..things that are...and some things that have not yet come to pass.}
<A>__{frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal...he peers into the glossy surface. the night sky is reflected into the water... suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure of an old man, clad in white robes. he walks down a long road. frodo leans closer to the mirror's surface... close on: gandalf lifts his head and looks directly at frodo! frodo gasps, his face lighting up with hope.}
<C>__{frodo}
<P>__{(joyous)}
<D>__{gandalf!}
<A>__{gandalf looks at frodo with a fierce intensity. frodo reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror. suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. the vision shifts...frodo gasps in horror! the shire is in ruins! the image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings burning...bodies strewn about...dark shapes of orcs looting and destroying...bag end, billowing in flames! the party tree is hacked down. frodo reels back as the mirror seems to grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing him entirely. image: hobbiton...now an industrial wasteland! the fields and trees destroyed...replaced with brick factories belching smoke! image: orcs brutally herd manacled hobbits into the factories! we see sam...merry... and rosie cotton. soot stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell hole! suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black abyss a single eye grows. close on: frodo is frozen. unable to move or cry out. the ring dangles from his neck, inches above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. fire erupts around the eye... with a yell, frodo pushes himself away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. light instantly fades from the mirror. frodo comes to his senses...he is shocked. galadriel stands still as a statue, unmoved, untouched by the horror.}
<C>__{galadriel}
<D>__{i know what it is you saw...for it is also in my mind. it is the future, frodo. it is what will come to pass if you should fail.}
<A>__{galadriel looks at frodo intensely...frodo looks down...in his hand he is clutching the ring. frodo looks up at galadriel.}
<C>__{galadriel }
<D>__{the fellowship is breaking. it has already begun. he will try to take the ring. you know of whom i speak. one by one, it will destroy them all.}
<C>__{frodo }
<D>__{if you ask it of me, i will give you the one ring.}
<C>__{galadriel}
<D>__{you offer it to me freely...i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.}
<A>__{galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before frodo's eyes. frodo is suddenly afraid of her.}
<C>__{galadriel }
<D>__{in place of the dark lord, you would have a queen, not dark, but beautiful and terrible as the dawn. treacherous as the sea! stronger than the foundations of the earth...all shall love me and despair! frodo takes a step away from galadriel...}
<A>__{galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender elf woman once more, clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.}
<C>__{galadriel }
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{i pass the test.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i will diminish and go into the west and remain galadriel. frodo's confidence drains away.}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{i cannot do this alone...}
<C>__{galadriel}
<D>__{you are the ring bearer, frodo...to bear a ring of power is to be alone. this task was appointed to you, and if you do not find a way, no one will.}
<A>__{frodo realizes what her message is.}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{then i know what i must do. it's just...i'm afraid to do it. galadriel kneels down to frodo's height, staring at him intently.}
<C>__{galadriel}
<D>__{even the smallest person can change the course of the future.}
<A>__{the ring lies in the palm of frodo's hand...his fingers close over it.}
