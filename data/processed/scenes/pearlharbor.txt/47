<L>__{exterior japanese island day}
<A>__{yamamoto and his planners have flown to a quiet japanese island, sunlit and pleasant. they are gathered on the shore of the island's natural harbor. wooden targets basically huge plank barriers are sunk into the water like ships at anchor. a squadron of japanese planes zooms overhead, taking up attack positions.}
<C>__{genda}
<D>__{we have chosen this place because its depth is exactly the same as pearl harbor's.}
<A>__{genda speaks into a field radio. a lone plane drops out of formation and goes into a low level approach, speeding up and dropping its torpedo. below the surface we see the torpedo as it plunges at two hundred miles an hour into the sunlit sea. with the wooden fins the torpedo makes a sharp dip and levels off above the sea floor. above the surface the planners see the path of the torpedo; it hits the wooden barrier with a satisfying thunk. the planners are impressed but yamamoto is not satisfied.}
<C>__{yamamoto}
<D>__{uncharged torpedoes have different balance.}
<C>__{genda}
<D>__{i have arranged a live fire drill with your permission.}
<A>__{yamamoto nods; genda speaks again into his radio, and another plane swoops down and drops a torpedo. genda holds his hands to his ears, causing the others to do the same; even though they wonder at the need. the torpedo hits the barrier, and the explosion is deafening, and of shocking force; the entire barrier is blown to toothpicks.}
<C>__{genda}
<D>__{of course against a ship the explosion will not be dissipated, and will have more force.}
<A>__{the planners, nearly blown off their feet, nod as if they knew that all the time.}
