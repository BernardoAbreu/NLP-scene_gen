<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior victorian estate 1895 day}
<A>__{close up: ornate antique grandfather clock strikes 2:15. the credits begin to roll. calligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand written in preparation for a formal reception. servants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier. hands rapidly shine silver cutlery. fresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{kitchen clock strikes 2:15. poultry plucked. feathers everywhere. steaming copper pots boiling over. platters prepared with decorative garnish. extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced. a glob of frosting enters a pair of puckered lips. the perpetrator, a fey, pompous, head valet, seriously considers the texture and flavor of the icing, then gives the pastry chef a withering, sour look. the valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch. 2:15.}
<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{antique bedside table clock just past 2:15. the valet throws open velvet drapes, sunlight floods the room revealing a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed. the valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt. the dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry kick. flinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet, selects three suits and holds them up for inspection. from beneath the puffiest of pillows, an eye reluctantly opens. a weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit.}
<L>__{exterior estate day}
<A>__{the riding outfit is adorned by leopold, duke of albany, a dashing, virile man in his 30's. galloping with great abandon, he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. he sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path. in the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the estate. rugs are beaten out of open windows.}
<L>__{interior hallway evening}
<A>__{large hallway clock 6:15. a pair of boots track a freshly scrubbed floor as leopold heads carelessly up the stairway. three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling the staff to clean up the mess.}
<B>__{series of close ups}
<A>__{gaudily framed portraits of somber relations. a bird sits listless in a gilded cage. hot water is poured into a bath. carriages begin to arrive. orchestra leader signals the musicians to play. guests fill the ballroom in formal attire.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror. he wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat of the period. he flexes slightly. the valet hastily fastens a corset around his mid section from behind. leopold eyes his reflection seductively. he becomes bored. he turns to his right. the valet spoons sorbet from a silver saucer into his mouth. he turns back to the mirror to watch himself eat. the valet pats his mouth dry. he affects a pampered strut, crossing the room as the valet sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. leopold thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror. finally, as if weighing a great decision, leopold hands his hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror.}
<B>__{close up}
<A>__{fine linen undervest slides over his head. black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist. the buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar. a cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand. a perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck. an elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails to the knees is fitted to his torso. his hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted. his eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb. his cheeks are pinched. a red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel. leopold stares into the mirror. the effect is dazzling. he raises one eyebrow. then, in a voice you could pour over a waffle:}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you dance like a herd of cattle, miss fairchild. you are a rare woman who lights up the room... simply by leaving it.}
<A>__{he bows. as he rises, the reflection of leopold's uncle otto, a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind leopold in the looking glass.}
<C>__{uncle otto}
<D>__{tell me leopold, do you plan to join us downstairs after completing this one sided flash of wit?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i despise affairs of this sort, uncle otto. no one really listens to anyone else. if you attempt it, you will see why.}
<C>__{uncle otto}
<D>__{you judge everything too severely. i wonder what would happen if you were to cast that critical eye inward?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you do not wonder at all. you merely ask in order to state your own opinion.}
<C>__{uncle otto}
<D>__{we are all concerned about you.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{ahh, here it comes.}
<C>__{uncle otto}
<D>__{your life does not seem to have any direction. at the age of 25 a man is too young to do anything well. at 35 he is too old. now is your time to take action. tell me, what is it you want to do with your life?}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{i do not know.}
<C>__{uncle otto}
<P>__{(just as weary)}
<D>__{your ignorance cramps my conversation.}
<P>__{(he slaps leopold's}
<D>__{face twice rather}
<P>__{quickly)}
<D>__{wake up! this is your one and only life. every man has the chance to make a difference. do something!}
<A>__{leopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i am most grateful for your surveillance and for your sympathy. i assure you there is no need for concern. i am as effectual and attentive... as my position allows.}
<C>__{uncle otto}
<D>__{life is not position, leopold. it is action.}
<P>__{(he straightens leopold's tie)}
<D>__{i will see you downstairs promptly. in the appropriate frame of mind.}
<A>__{he leaves. leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers. the valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy. leopold shoots him a look. the valet fills the glass higher. leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. he hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. finally...}
<C>__{the valet}
<P>__{(grandly)}
<D>__{go spread joy.}
<A>__{without looking back, leopold leaves the room.}
<L>__{interior ballroom night}
<A>__{music fills the air as the creme de la creme of victorian society gather inside. leopold holds a prearranged dance card. he looks at the names and finds his first partner is miss tree. leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting god.}
<L>__{interior ballroom dance floor night}
<A>__{a profoundly self conscious leopold dances energetically into frame with miss tree, an ancient, elfin, yet amazingly spry woman who gapes up at him searchingly, unblinking. leopold opens his mouth to speak, can think of nothing suitable to say, and clamps his mouth shut. they dance out of frame.}
<L>__{interior ballroom dance floor night}
<A>__{leopold dances into frame with clara, a beautiful girl of}
<L>__{19. he glances at her and smiles. she titters, turning away}
<A>__{shyly. they whirl around the dance floor. his smile grows into a broad grin. caught up in the excitement, clara beams up at him... happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky teeth. leopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on.}
<L>__{interior ballroom dance floor night}
<A>__{leopold lumbers into frame with miss fairchild, a woman of immense girth. with great dignity and extreme difficulty he maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except her enormous bosom.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you dance like an angel, miss fairchild. you light up the room. i thank you.}
<A>__{miss fairchild curtseys heavily. leopold glances at his card, sees the name miss serena clacket and shudders. he spots a very lovely woman hidden amongst the guests. she scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around. hiding his dance card, he saunters over.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{good evening. i do not believe i have had the pleasure.}
<A>__{the young woman stares vacantly at leopold until she realizes he is addressing her. she puts her pad away.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{...julia carlson.}
<A>__{leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{i'm sorry. will you excuse me?}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(slightly tipsy)}
<D>__{you are not from the area, are you?}
<C>__{carlson}
<P>__{(smiles and shakes her head "no")}
<D>__{are you?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{this is my estate.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{really?}
<P>__{(looking around the room)}
<D>__{well it's not home but it's much...}
<A>__{leopold regards her curiously. the orchestra starts up. there is a hubbub amongst the guests.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{shocking! the ta ra ra boom de ay.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{the? oh, that's from paris, isn't it?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{it is a scandal nonetheless.}
<A>__{leopold spots uncle otto observing him from across the room.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{miss carlson, do me the honor?}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{i'm afraid i'm not much of a dancer.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(smiling seductively)}
<D>__{truly i would be in your debt. any admonition would be erased simply by presenting a partner as lovely as yourself.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{no, no. really, i...}
<A>__{leopold stiffly holds out his arm. a beat. carlson, stuck, takes it with hesitation and is escorted to the dance floor. they dance. all but leopold and carlson gaily sing "ta ra ra boom de ay." leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. carlson, shy at first, eventually smiles brightly.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i suppose we really ought to sing along.}
<C>__{carlson}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{oh, golly.}
<A>__{they half sing, half speak the ta ra ra boom de ay, their emphasis on "boom." laughing giddily, their dancing becomes freer, picking up speed. the room spins. finally:}
<C>__{carlson}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{thank you for the dance. it was lovely. i hope it wasn't too awful for you.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{not at all. it was most enlightening.}
<A>__{there is a slight pause. the grandfather clock strikes midnight.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{i really must be going.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i won't hear of it.}
<C>__{carlson}
<P>__{(moving away from him)}
<D>__{no, i'm quite late as it is.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i shall see you to the door...}
<C>__{carlson}
<P>__{(stopping him resolutely)}
<D>__{you're very sweet. i had a wonderful time.}
<P>__{(she watches him,}
<D>__{memorizing his face.}
<P>__{then firmly)}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. he watches carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard door. he surveys the room. after a moment he follows her.}
<L>__{exterior garden night}
<A>__{leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the dark. he hears an eerie metallic sound. he slows down, brushes back the thicket. the silhouette of a woman is revealed. she is once again writing in her notebook.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{miss carlson?}
<A>__{carlson spins around quickly, panicked. leopold stops. partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped, mechanical device. it's door open, lit from within, casting a weird glow.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{good god...}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{what are you...? you frightened me.}
<A>__{leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch it...}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{what sort of mechanism is this?}
<A>__{carlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{answer me!}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{it's perfectly all right. it's...}
<A>__{leopold carefully examines the apparatus, stepping inside. carlson freezes.}
<C>__{carlson}
<P>__{(carefully, deliberately)}
<D>__{listen to me. please. move very slowly. step out of the machine. step out and i will explain whatever you want to know.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{what is this? who are you?}
<A>__{his hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{oh, god.}
<A>__{she yanks on his arm. instinctively he pulls away, accidentally thrusting the lever into action. carlson falls from the machine.}
<C>__{carlson}
<P>__{(suddenly frantic)}
<D>__{get out of there! get out now!}
<A>__{the machine lights up.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{miss carlson... i...}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{no!!!}
<A>__{the compartment door snaps shut.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{shit!!}
<A>__{there is a bright white flash. blackness fills the screen.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior n.y.c. laboratory 1995 day}
<A>__{the compartment door slides open revealing dr. kau, 30's, an asian doctor with a thick brooklyn accent. her face full of enthusiasm drops as she sees the unconscious leopold.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{shit!!}
<A>__{she turns to her co workers, warning them.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{shit!!}
<A>__{she looks back at leopold.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{shit!!}
<A>__{her co workers, dr. plodder, austere, authoritative, dr. drake, muddled and timid, peer inside the compartment door.}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{good god!}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{everybody stay calm... lock the front door.}
<A>__{dr. drake and kau make a move to inspect an unconscious leopold.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{no, no, no. you mustn't touch him. the consequences could be catastrophic.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{he could be hurt, or even dead.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{...all right. touch him.}
<A>__{they approach leopold. dr. kau finds carlson's note pad on the ground next to leopold. she reads the last entry.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{...but i'm stuck and it's only a dance and he is the seventh duke of albany...}
<A>__{they all look at one another, then back at leopold.}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{carlson...!}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<P>__{(racing from the room)}
<D>__{give me a minute...}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{shit!}
<L>__{interior lab kate's office day}
<A>__{katherine coles, a radiant workaholic, types frenetically into the computer while talking on the phone, trying hard not to sound upset.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{who's upset? people fall in love, they have to climb back out.}
<P>__{(she laughs but she is not smiling)}
<D>__{so, what? we'll just be friends now, right?}
<A>__{she stops typing and listens for a while. she runs her hand through her hair.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i see. well i appreciate your honesty.}
<P>__{(using her middle}
<D>__{finger she pushes up}
<P>__{her glasses)}
<D>__{no. i will just think of this as surviving another dating accident. take care or good luck or whatever i'm supposed to...}
<A>__{the line goes dead.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{...say... goodbye.}
<A>__{dr. plodder bursts in. kate sees his distress and instantly becomes very centered.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{she's back.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{that's impossible! she wasn't supposed to return until...}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{kate. it's carlson. something went wrong.}
<A>__{he hands her carlson's note pad. slowly, she sits down.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{...the 7th duke...}
<L>__{interior lab day}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(all business, reading from a printout)}
<D>__{...of albany. he was the... is the son of emery and eliza. he was of no actual importance until he vanished at the turn of the century without a trace. it was a sensation. in the 30's they even made a movie about him. "the tenuous duke" with ronald coleman.}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<P>__{(absently)}
<D>__{i love ronald coleman.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{despite much speculation and a nation wide investigation, a body was never found. he was never heard from again.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{until now.}
<A>__{there is a stunned silence. they stare at leopold in awe.}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{we've altered the course of history.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{we never should have started this...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{calm down.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{what are we going to do? we can't keep him here. imagine if anyone found out!}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{think. just, think. rationally. now, no one would believe such a stupid mistake could be made because no one would believe any of this is possible. so. we fix this. we keep this to ourselves and we fix it. fast.}
<A>__{they all nod in agreement.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{dr. kau, research all our data. 1st priority: locate carlson. drake, determine the reciprocal correlation's connected to the 19th century. work 24 hours a day if necessary. in the meantime... one of us will have to take charge of him.}
<A>__{she forces back panic. only the tremor in her voice gives her away.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{this is a major scientific opportunity. it doesn't get any better than this. imagine. researching the behavior, the physical and emotional characteristics of a century ago! utilizing technology available to us today... he's a gold mine!}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{he's a man, kate. not a guinea pig.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{and while he's here, he's ours. any volunteers?}
<A>__{no one moves.}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{we'll draw names. whoever is is picked will be responsible. agreed?}
<A>__{they nod reluctantly. drake writes out names and throws them in a cup. the silence becomes deafening. finally:}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{i will do it.}
<A>__{all the scientists face her.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{you'll look after him?}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{no, i meant i will pick the name.}
<A>__{she reaches in. they wait with mounting suspense. finally she turns to kate. the scientists follow her gaze. a beat.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{leopold stirs. he blinks at the group.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{where...? what has happened?!}
<A>__{the doctors, caught off guard, smile benignly. they surround leopold as a group, not knowing where to begin. finally:}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{your grace... um... hello... weee aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge research team. a project funded by the government of the united states.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(regarding their}
<D>__{appearance with}
<P>__{distaste)}
<D>__{oh. americans. i see...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{yes, um... for the past six and a half years we've been conducting scientific experiments on density and flexibility in the dimensions of time and space.}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{yes, uh... quite by accident we came upon a formula utilizing tachyons... particles traveling faster than the speed of light, which allowed us to... fold time so to speak.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{yes. bend it between the cracks of the dimensions.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{they all laugh nervously. leopold does not.}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{now, while that wasn't the original purpose of our experiment, we opted to pursue it, well, privately, on our own.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{borrowing funds already provided.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{we journeyed to your time because it was the quickest path to follow. we debated long and hard whether we should use this knowledge at all. believe me, it was never our intent to disturb the past...}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{merely to discover if the expedition were possible. as your presence here confirms... we are very disturbed.}
<A>__{leopold nods at them as if they are insane.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{the problem facing us is not only how to get you back, but when, you see?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{we certainly don't want to miscalculate. send you to a different era entirely.}
<A>__{leopold starts to speak.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{rest assured, no harm will come to you. you'll be well looked after by dr. coles.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{dr. coles...? i do not follow. what do you mean, get me back home?... where am i?}
<A>__{awkward pause. leopold looks carefully around the room for the first time: modern mechanical equipment, data shifting and changing, giant cooling devices, bright neon lighting. the doctors are silent.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{answer me!...}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{would you have me believe... i am being detained, at present in the hereafter?... the time to come?}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{it is the year nineteen hundred and ninety five.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{...19...?}
<A>__{leopold leaps up. the doctors follow him around the room.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you're insane! all of you! this is impossible!}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{leopold, calm down!}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{a voyage through time! what do you take me for? did you bring me here by force?}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{we're scientist, not seditionists.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(truly panicked)}
<D>__{let me out of here! i won't stand for this another moment!}
<A>__{he's out the door.}
<L>__{interior underground hallway day}
<A>__{leopold moves quickly, fearfully through the darkly lit hallway, the doctors close behind.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{leopold, wait!}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{you don't know what you're doing.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{just listen to what we have to say!}
<A>__{it is too late. leopold throws open the door and runs upstairs.}
<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{blinding sunlight. skyscrapers. automobiles. traffic lights. road construction. modern day pedestrians. helicopters. car alarms. leopold stands frozen, overwhelmed, taking it all in.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{19...?}
<A>__{the doctors reach him. he collapses to the ground.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior car day}
<A>__{kate and dr. kau talk quietly. leopold, tightly holding onto his seat and the back door, gazes out the window in utter disbelief.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{squab.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{squab?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i remember reading they ate a lot of squab.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{squab... do you have a squab?}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(quietly. on the verge of panic)}
<D>__{i don't know!}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{pull yourself together!}
<P>__{(turning to leopold)}
<D>__{are you all right back there?}
<A>__{leopold, trembling, gapes at the sights, every day sounds, magnified. perspiration runs down the side of his face. kate watches him in her rear view mirror.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you're going to be fine you know. there's nothing to worry about. i have everything under control.}
<A>__{dr. kau stares at kate in concerned silence.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(quietly to dr. kau)}
<D>__{we'll never get away with this.}
<L>__{interior bedroom the next morning}
<A>__{leopold awakens alone in his room. he sits up with a jolt. his stomach sinks as he realizes this is no dream. he slowly rises to his full stature, moving to the window he looks out on the modern day city, shaking his head in awe. he makes his way to the bedroom door and tentatively touches the knob. there is a knock on the door. leopold jumps back and runs to the bed: the picture of dignity.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{how are you feeling?}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{i thought you might like some tea.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i insist on being returned home immediately.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i understand. we're doing our best.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i wish to speak with your employer, dr. coles.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you're speaking to him.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you are not suggesting that you are dr. coles?}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{miss... uh?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{dr. coles. if you like, you could call me miss dr. coles or if that's too much, how about just plain kate?}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{a woman of science?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{hard to believe?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{but a woman's brain cannot obtain enough knowledge to posses a truly scientific mind.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(jotting this down)}
<D>__{interesting. nevertheless, we've come a long way baby.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{are you attempting to be humorous?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm attempting to be informative it's just coming out humorous.}
<A>__{leopold regards her dubiously.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(clinically)}
<D>__{look, modern social science clearly states that a woman's place in society marks the level of that civilization. a science career for a woman is now almost as acceptable as being a... a... waitress. cream and sugar?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{young lady, i... surely it is not expected that i remain here with you indefinitely... unchaperoned?}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(pen poised)}
<D>__{does that make you nervous?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{certainly not!}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(writing)}
<D>__{then what are you getting so red about? it's a very large apartment... with locks on all the doors.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{the idea! my dear miss coles...}

<D>__{dr. coles.}

<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you smoke camel's, you wear old spices, and you drink mountains dew. it's revolting.}
<P>__{(to kate)}
<D>__{the pudding tonight is excellent. another thing i've noticed, everyone is in a great rush today. instant oatmeal, instant coffee, speed stick, minute maid. you'll find there's much to be said for moderation and languor.}

<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{mmmm. is it tapioca?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{it's margarine.}

<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{if you'd rather i didn't go...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{nonsense! charlie, you don't want to hurt leopold's feelings. he's going to think you don't want him to go.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh it's not that. it's just that it's sort of a vulgar crowd, is all. i'm not sure you'd have such a good time.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{a little ribald humor? i'm not as big a stick in the mud as you might think! i'd enjoy a gay night out, kicking up my heels.}
<A>__{there is an awkward pause. leopold is so enthusiastic and sincere that despite a feeling of disaster charlie relents.}

<D>__{just drop it leopold.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{but charles, it is so ridiculous. i am not interested in her.}

<D>__{hah!}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{in any case the problem is not with me but with you.}
<P>__{(quietly)}

<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{a merry andrew.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i am not!!}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{everything plays like a farce to you. the more wit, the less courage. i believe the modern woman desires passion, protection, sensitivity. no woman wants to be romanced by a buffoon.}
<P>__{(the old woman shakes her head)}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you think i should pounce?}

<D>__{how inconsiderate.}
<C>__{kate}

<C>__{kate}
