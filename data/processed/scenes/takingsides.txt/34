<L>__{exterior partly ruined church evening}
<A>__{summer evening. the first movement of schubert's string quintet in c major, d956, played by three men and two women to a large audience packed into the ruins, partly open to the sky, dymshitz among them. at the rear of the church, emmi and david, enraptured, seated side by side. the first movement ends and the adagio begins. after the music gathers momentum: rain. thunder and lightning. the musicians continue to play, unperturbed. they are coming to the end of the quintet. david and emmi huddled together. some umbrellas up and then movement which catches david's attention. he nudges emmi, i indicates with his chin. people have moved to reveal furtwangler: seated, wearing a hat, still i' as a statue, soaked, listening, expressionless. much applause. the musicians bow. the audience start to leave. emmi and david emerge from the ruins. furtwangler passes them. they nod awkwardly. he doesn't respond but is about to walk on when dymshitz pushes through, nods to david, who salutes. dymshitz catches up with furtwangler. they are near to emmi and david.}
