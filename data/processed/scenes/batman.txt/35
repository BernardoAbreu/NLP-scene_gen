<L>__{interior chemical supply room a moment later}
<A>__{jack sprints through the room, firing four shots at the metal chemical tanks on the wall. toxic chemicals gush out onto the floor in streams. the streams run together... begin to smoke and sizzle. cops right behind him. jack can't resist taking one last pot shot at a fifth chemical tank. an explosion knocks him off his feet.}
<L>__{interior factory floor a moment later}
<A>__{cops look on in puzzlement as a river of chemicals courses out into the main refinery. a second later, they go up in flames. a wall of fire bisects the factory floor. jack races along behind the spreading wall of flame. the cops can't see him now. he ducks behind a huge machine, hits a switch and sluice gates open. chemical sludge begins to churn. a big hole in the wall appears as a gate opens on the east river. it's the waste dump! up on the catwalk, batman has a perfect view of jack. if jack can just sprint through the flames without getting shot, he'll make it to the river. batman hooks a rope to his batarang, flings it at a catwalk across the floor. jack bolts. bursts through the wall of fire. and just as he does batman leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him! his foot catches a thirty foot roll of plastic, six feet in diameter, one of several standing upright on the floor. the plastic roll drops into jack's path, blocking his exit. an instant later, batman lands on top of jack. wraps an arm around his throat and raises his free hand. drug tipped steel talons appear. but before he can paralyze jack...}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hold it!}
<A>__{in all the ruckus, hood v has managed to circle back behind the heavy machinery. now he's got a gun pointed directly at commissioner gordon's head.}
<C>__{hood v}
<D>__{let him go or i will do it.}
<A>__{batman releases jack and stands back. jack chuckles to himself: what loyalty. then, with plenty of time, he strolls across the floor to a jacob's ladder mounted on the back wall... and begins to climb toward the catwalks. all action stops. batman doesn't move. the cops don't move. hood v stands there sweating, his gun hand shaking as he waits for jack to climb safely out of shooting range. eckhardt's pig like eyes glisten. his hand drops to his side. he's half tempted to pull a gun and get the commissioner plugged.}
<B>__{angle on jack}
<A>__{at a crouch, groping his way along the rail of the catwalk. he reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a supporting rod. it's a forty foot drop to the swirling black currents of the east river... and freedom. he's about to climb out when his eye falls on a .38 automatic which lies, abandoned, on the gridwork floor of the catwalk mere yards away.}
<B>__{angle on factory floor}
<A>__{the hood, one arm around gordon. with his gun at the commissioner's temple, he backs slowly toward the door.}
<C>__{hood v}
<D>__{nobody makes a move. we go out clean.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{eckhardt!!}
<A>__{all eyes turn to the catwalk overhead, where jack stands poised with the .38 in his fist. a single shot drops eckhardt cleanly. the moment's distraction is all batman needs. he hurls a ninja wheel a small, ratcheted, razor sharp disc at the forearm of hood v. one jerk of a thin filament wire a sudden shriek and gordon is free. the thug lurches forward. his gun drops to the floor,}
<B>__{discharging accidentally.}
<A>__{an ungodly howl of pain echoes out from the catwalk above. jack reels and staggers, his hands clutching at his cheeks. blood gushes from between his fingers.}
<B>__{jack napier has been shot through the face.}
<A>__{a young cop, unnerved by the sight of jack's agonized pirouette, draws his gun and opens fire.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{no!!}
<A>__{but the bullet has caught jack in the arm. he spins, totters to the edge of the catwalk... and topples over. the cops look on helplessly as jack plunges two stories down into a catch basin full of bubbling toxic waste, screaming}
<B>__{all the way.}
<C>__{gordon }
<D>__{goddammit, we had him. we }
<A>__{and suddenly, with jack out of the picture, all attention focusses on the batman. cops reach for their guns, circle warily around him. cornered now, he backs off slowly, hands}
<B>__{on his belt.}
<C>__{gordon }
<D>__{hold it right there, mister.}
<A>__{the batman raises his hands in a gesture of surrender. then as the cops advance he flicks two tiny capsules onto the factory floor. a blinding flash of light. colors burst in a wild pyrotechnic display. cops stumble backwards, momentarily dazzled, as a thick wall of black smoke conceals batman from view. a tiny grappling hook rockets out of the dense curling cloud and catches on a catwalk overhead.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{the cops are firing wildly into the smoke. but it's too late. at the end of a cord, the black majestic figure of the batman whips upward, rising out of the smoke like an avenging angel and disappearing into the shadowy heights, safely out of range.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{hold your fire!}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{... who is this guy?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i don't know, but he's one hell of a showman.}
