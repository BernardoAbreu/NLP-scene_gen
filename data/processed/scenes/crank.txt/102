<L>__{exterior street in front of tv store}
<A>__{with a last look at the tv drones he breaks from the crowd and goes into stealth mode, darting from car to car in an exaggerated ninja crouch, trying to sneak up on the cop. he comes up behind him, transfers his gun and cell phone to one hand, and heart pounding reaches stealthily for the cop’s holster with the other. car horns blare as motorists attempt to warn the cop, who flinches and whips around at the noise but it’s too late: chev has the gun. he begins to hop around maniacally, taunting the cop, as everyone panics and tries to reverse out of the traffic snarl, slamming into fenders, driving up onto the sidewalk, etc.}

<P>__{(tossing the gun up and catching it)}
<D>__{you want it? you want this?}
<A>__{the cop jumps off the bike and tries to make a go at him, but jerks back when chev catches the gun. chev holds the gun up like a fetch stick, gluing the cop’s eyes, then flings it 40 feet through the air to splash into a plaza fountain. the cop starts after it, then stops short as he sees chev dart past him and hop onto his still idling motorcycle. he kicks up the stand and revs it.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{you son of a bitch!}
<A>__{the cop makes a dive for chev, grabbing him by the waist as the bike jerks forward. chev starts to burn the bike out as the cop hangs on, dragging. smoke erupts; black bits of rubber spray like buckshot, pelting the cop. chev does a 360 degree burnout, kicking with his leg to keep the bike under control, then jerking, skidding, blasts off. the cop hangs on, cursing, dragging, boots smoking, for a half block before he bails out.}
