<L>__{exterior bathroom window and above night}
<A>__{ted hears a sound from above and twists himself around, spotting a young man (previously seen as the yuppie scumbag on the phone) leaning out of the window directly above him. after a quick moment of sizing him up, ted gathers himself.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{hi...}
<A>__{no answer. something's wrong with the guy, all the blood is drained from his face and he is mumbling something.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{listen, i'm stuck here in a situation that i can't even begin to explain, but would you be so kind as to get help? could you call the police, please?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{the young man manages to belt out the word "ice" just before hurling a mouthful of vomit toward ted. it takes all ted's strength to dodge the puke and pull himself back into the bathroom. he falls back on the floor. he props himself up and checks for damage. he notices something odd... the room is silent. no sigfried. he walks into the bedroom.}
