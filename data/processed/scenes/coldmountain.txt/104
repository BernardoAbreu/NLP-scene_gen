<L>__{exterior a path. driving rain. night}
<A>__{the home guard ride, bent under their oilskins, as the rain tips down. between the horses, unprotected and drenched, their prisoners trudge along the muddy path. inman and veasey among them. veasey has grown some beard. an older man collapses, lies where he falls, not moving. there's a domino effect and so inman falls on top of him. he picks himself up, then tries to pull up the older man. he doesn't move.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{he's dead.}
<A>__{the horses plough on. inman shouts to brown, the leader.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{this man's dead!}
<A>__{nobody pays any attention. he has to drag the body.}
