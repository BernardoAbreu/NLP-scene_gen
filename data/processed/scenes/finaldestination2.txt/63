<L>__{interior thomas' apartment night}
<A>__{kimberly whispers into the phone.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i'm sorry, dad, we're having a hard time with shaina's eulogy. i will stay here at virginia's tonight and see you tomorrow. i love you too.}
<A>__{she hangs up, looking guilty for having lied to her father. clear keeps her eyes on the pens that roll on the slightly canted table into the about to fall white pages directory.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{remember everyone, just because kimberly's got the power doesn't mean we're not all capable of seeing signs to some extent.}
<A>__{the pens softly tap the phone book one by one until it lazily tips over and plops heavily onto a goose down throw pillow. small feathers from the pillow are carried upwards by the breeze. everyone in the room watches them rise.}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{it's like forrest gump.}
<A>__{they float across the room, ultimately landing on a mousetrap! snap! the trap flies over and knocks into the base of the unstable grabber which tips and slowly slides down the wall. clear, in a chair, looks directly above her head at a large swordfish mounted on the wall. the grabber picks up speed, arcs downward and hits the mounted swordfish. the supporting brackets give, causing the swordfish to tip and slide downward! clear lurches back in her chair just in time the razor sharp bill impales the seat cushion between her legs!}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{fuck. should have seen that coming. the institution's made me soft.}
<A>__{clear gets up, carefully easing herself around the swordfish. eugene isn't quite sure what to make of what he's just seen.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{if death has got such a hard on for you, maybe you should get the hell away from us.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{we need her. she's the only one who's dealt with this before, idiot!}
<A>__{kimberly looks self conscious by her outburst. clear, however, looks grateful.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{we're all going to have to open our eyes from now on. look out for each other. sleep in shifts.}
<P>__{(looks around apartment)}
<D>__{and we've got to safeproof this deathtrap.}
<A>__{montage safeproofing the apartment everyone but nora and eugene helps unplug appliances, put out the fire, take down hanging objects, switch off the gas, put sharp objects away, affix padding to chart corners... kat, placing poisonous cleansers and flammable liquids in a box, nervously pulls out a pack of smokes. thomas watches as he takes a hanging mirror off the wall.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{screw this. i'm going outside for a smoke.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{you think you should? it's not safe out there.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{so? nora's gotta bite it before me anyway, right?}
<A>__{kat steps towards the front door, then remembers the cell phone and grabs it just in case. thomas smiles 'good job' at her. kimberly, unscrewing the light bulb, looks up when nora rises from the couch in a stupor and struggles to put on her jacket. kimberly looks concerned.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{where are you going, nora? you okay?}
<A>__{nora fights the sleeve, dazed and defeated.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{four years ago my husband died. now tim. there's nothing left for me.}
<A>__{kimberly stops pouring liquor down the drain.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{don't say that. once you lose hope, it's already too late.}
<A>__{eugene snickers. nora looks up, anger surfacing.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{if it's my time to go, to be in heaven with my family, then i can accept that.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{you can't give up. don't accept death's plan. trust me, you can fight this. if we can just survive long enough until that baby is born, we can }
<A>__{nora looks more resolute than ever.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{if you'll excuse me, i have a funeral to prepare.}
<A>__{everyone looks crushed when nora heads for the door. except eugene, who stands up as well.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{yeah, why am i listening to a girl who just got out of the nut house?}
<A>__{as eugene heads out, kimberly becomes enraged and grabs him.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{seeing you die once was enough for me.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{whatever. i control my life, not fate.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{i will be sure to put that on your tombstone.}
<A>__{rory presses a cell phone into eugene's hand on his way out.}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{be careful. and even if you don't believe, give this to nora.}
