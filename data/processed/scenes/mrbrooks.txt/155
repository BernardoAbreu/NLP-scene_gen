<A>__{repeating their arthritic performance the elevator doors open. atwood steps out into a wide sporadically lit hallway. peering at the numbers atwood goes to her left. in the middle of the hall behind her a couple exits a room and drifts to the other side of the hall on their way to the elevator. atwood re checks the number on the moving company's work order 517, she's going the wrong way. she turns around. now atwood and the couple are walking toward each other on opposite sides of the hall. atwood steps into an area of light. the reflection off her face catches the attention of the man who is wearing a wide brimmed hat. he lifts his head. it's thorton meeks. the woman with him was the driver of the van. she's wearing a watchcap. meeks gently takes his companion's arm. they stop. her eyes go to where he's looking and then back to his. at some unspoken signal they both draw their guns. intent on finding 517 and baffert, the couple hasn't registered on atwood's radar. bang! twock! a chunk of plaster blows off the wall next to her head. startled, atwood winces away. bang! the woman fires. the slug explodes the plaster on the other side of atwood's head. now atwood is turning toward them, gun in hand. meeks fires. the bullet passes through atwood's jacket. instinctively atwood assumes a classic duelist's pose offering the smallest target possible. calmly she squeezes off her first shot. the plaster explodes from the wall above meeks' head. the woman fires. a hole appears in atwood's sleeve. atwood pulls the trigger again. smack! the woman screams and falls back into meeks, a bullet in her hip. atwood's third shot takes the hat off meeks head. she now realizes who her attackers are.}

<A>__{dragging the woman in the direction of the stairs, bang! meeks fires. maybe it's his broken trigger finger that affects his aim. the shots miss. bang! bang! the woman fires. atwood's next two shots miss. meeks and the woman arrive at the stairs and before rounding the corner, bang! bang! bang!, fire at atwood who is now moving deliberately at them. atwood doesn't try and dodge the bullets or flinch away from them and her shots are unhurried. the next one catches the woman in the side. the one after that nails meeks in the left shoulder. he's spun into the woman.}
