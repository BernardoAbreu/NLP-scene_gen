<L>__{interior mumford's apartment magic}
<A>__{mumford comes in, drops his coat, gets a carton of orange juice out of the fridge and drinks directly from it. distracted, he picks up the remote from the kitchen counter and switches on the tv, then opens his freezer and stares inside. unsolved mysteries comes on. the opening segment previews a story about a couple who claim to have had a visitation from gianni versace, then one about a yacht that went down near venezuela. robert stack, in his characteristic fragmented delivery, intones the preview for the last story, accompanied by appropriate footage:}

<D>__{...a drug rehabilitation center in the lonely southwestern desert... run by reclusive monks... becomes the point of departure in a mysterious vanishing...}
<A>__{a close up of an irs identification card featuring a picture of a younger mumford, badly photographed in suit and tie. his name is not visible.}
<C>__{robert stack}
<D>__{...as an intrepid government investigator disappears without a trace.}
<A>__{in the kitchen, mumford spins to look. dissolve to: later in the program. documentary shots of irs headquarters, etc., are intercut : with hokey looking re enactments from mumford's life with a young actor who looks vaguely like mumford playing him. in mumford's apartment the telephone is ringing. clearly, it's not the first time. mumford, watching the show intently, lifts the headset an inch from the cradle and then hangs up. when it immediately rings again, mumford takes it off the hook, cuts off the call, and buries the headset under a sofa cushion. on the show: scenes of tax investigation in the show's version the irs guys have drawn guns and are storming houses are interspersed with scenes of sordid drug taking.}

<D>__{...despite brilliant promise as a fearless investigator... found himself on a downward spiral of drug abuse and dissolution...}
<A>__{mumford's sister, the real thing, a plain, middle aged west virginia woman, appears in a "dramatic", badly lit interview. (as with all the interviewees, she is identified by a supered title.)}
<C>__{mumford's sister}
<D>__{...we didn't talk much after our folks died, but i know he felt his life had taken a wrong turn...}
<A>__{a snapshot of some irs era party, happy revelers posing for a flash. camera pushes in on mumford, smiling and high, his neck encircled by gregory's arm. candy is on the other side of gregory. a shot of the pennsylvania turnpike as a state police cruiser zips by.}
<C>__{robert stack}
<D>__{his former undercover partner at the irs... is now a trooper with the pennsylvania state police...}
<A>__{gregory, in state police uniform, with a sadistic glint in his eye, is interviewed by the roadside, cars whipping by.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{the guy was obsessed... didn't always know where to draw the line... but i would have trusted him with my wife er, my life }
<P>__{(looks off camera, laughing)}
<D>__{ what'd i say? both, actually...}
<P>__{(gets serious again)}
<D>__{...i can't say i was surprised, though, when he disappeared.}
<A>__{ragged telephoto shots of the drug rehab center in the desert, low, innocuous adobe buildings.}
<C>__{robert stack}
<D>__{who was this enigma... a courageous public servant or a debauched addict?... either way, his last known stop was here... isolated in the arizona desert... taken in by an order of devoted monks...}
<A>__{in an arizona town, a monk with a clerical collar, brother timothy, is loading groceries into the back of a pick up. he's being ambush interviewed. he's polite, but not cooperative.}
<C>__{brother timothy}
<D>__{we don't talk about the people who've been our guests... but i can tell you this about our order we believe everybody has the right to start over... everybody deserves a second chance.}
<A>__{shots of wind swept desert, cactus, and dust blown highway.}
<C>__{robert stack}
<D>__{and perhaps... that is exactly the chance the now sober pilgrim took... on a blustery november day... walking away from the rehab center... never to be heard from again...}
<A>__{mumford's sister again:}
<C>__{mumford's sister}
<D>__{i'd like to know if he's alive. if he is, i just hope he's happy and his new life is...}
<P>__{(not sure how to put it)}
<D>__{...well, i hope he's found what he was looking for...}
<A>__{mumford, in his apartment, watches with real emotion. his sister's face dissolves into a new snapshot of mumford, dressed in an orkin exterminator uniform, as the music on the show comes up. a 1 800 telephone number appears across the bottom of the frame.}
<C>__{robert stack}
<D>__{if you have any information about this man or know anything about his whereabouts, contact the sheriff's department in cochise county, arizona, or call this number...}
