<A>__{outside the back door of a rowdy tavern, we find a prostitute servicing a sailor in the alley: he's got her pressed against the wall, skirt hiked up. it's not long before he's finished. off he goes, staggering back into the bar. she arranges her skirt, tucking the money away... and pauses, noticing a tall figure in the shadows. staring. she approaches with her best saucy smile:}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{want some yourself? or just like to watch?}
<P>__{(draws close)}
<D>__{what do you say, lover? i can make it good for you.}
<A>__{the creature leans into the light, clamps a massive hand to her mouth. his other arm wraps around her waist, pulling her off the ground. she gazes up, eyes wide, screams muffled in his palm. softly:}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{i know you can.}
<A>__{and he wrenches his arm, snapping her spine.}
