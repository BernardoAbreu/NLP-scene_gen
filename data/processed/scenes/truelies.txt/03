<A>__{camera moving toward: a figure in diving gear working at the metal bars with an oxygen arc cutting torch. one bar has already been cut out. two quick cuts and a second bar falls to the muddy bottom. lit now only from the floodlights filtering down through the ice, the figure slips through the bars and swims powerfully along the stone canal wall. seem from below, the figure is a black shadow moving against the rippled glass of the ice above.}
