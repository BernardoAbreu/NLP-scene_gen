<L>__{ext countryside day}
<A>__{walking. searching. the day turning late. red finds himself staring at a distant field. there's a long rock wall, like something out o f a robert frost poem. big oak tree. red checks his compass. north end. he crosses a dirt road into the field.}
<L>__{ext hayfield day}
<A>__{red walks the long rock wall, nearing the tree. a squirrel scolds him from a low branch, scurries up higher. red studies the base of the wall. nothing unusual here. just a bunch of rocks set in stone. he sighs. fool's errand. turns to go. something catches his eye. he walks back, squats, peering closer. wets a fingertip and rubs a stone. a layer of dust comes off. volcanic glass. gleaming black. he tries to get the rock out, anticipation growing. it won't come; it's too smooth. he pulls a pocketknife and levers the rock free. it tumbles at his feet, leaving a ragged hole. red leans down and solves the mystery at last, staring at the object buried under the rock. stunned. it's an envelope wrapped in plastic. written on it is a single word: "red." red pulls the envelope out and rises. he just stares at it for a while, almost afraid to open it. but open it he does. inside is a smaller envelope and a letter. red begins to read:}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{dear red. if you're reading this, you've gotten out. and if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further. you remember the name of the town, don't you? i could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels. i will keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{remember, red. hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. i will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well. your friend. andy.}
<A>__{by now, tears are spilling silently down red's cheeks. he opens the other envelope and fans out a stack of new fifty dollar bills. twenty of them. a thousand dollars.}
