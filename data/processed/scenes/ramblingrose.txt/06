<A>__{a pov shot of a tall, gaunt, almost totally bald man at the next ticket counter. the man is about sixty five and looks like a half senile great dane. he is dave wilkie, erstwhile husband of the heroine of this story. age has not been at all kind to dave; his face is lined with bitterness, he is a sour, angry, lonely man and now he is making a very unpleasant scene with a ticket girl and an airline representative, waving his ticket and gesticulating angrily. he wears an expensive, ill fitting suit and a texas type hat. we don't hear his angry complaints, no dialogue is on the track.}
