<L>__{exterior campus parking lot harvest fair entrance night}
<A>__{tim and beth, standouts as punk versions of frankenstein and his bride, stride purposefully toward the fair entrance. beth is a jumble of nerves as she runs down her checklist of events.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{seven thirty is the costume pageant ... carving jack o' lanterns at eight ... photos for the school paper at nine ... then harry lights the tree at nine thirty ... i just know i'm forgetting something!}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{relax. everything's cool. didn't i tell you harry would be here?}
<A>__{the limo crawls into the parking lot. a stampede of overzealous fans surge past them.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{that's what worries me.}
<A>__{tim and beth move into the fair, with all its noise and colorful movement.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{kids waving signs and t shirts. throwing themselves at the windows. frenzied clamoring. harry mania abound. the wknb van parks parallel to the steps of the library, adorned with harem girls and a large golden throne. the side door opens. a red carpet is rolled out. a tall, imposing figure emerges from the van and walks up the steps. spurs clanking on black boots. "jesse james" style duster. hat cocked slightly.}
<C>__{harry simms }
<D>__{hellllo, haddonfield!!!}
<A>__{the crowd turns in a mass of confusion. standing above them, waving from a microphone, is harry. dark sunglasses. gaunt, glacial features and an outrageous mane of black hair. suddenly harry throws open his duster flashing them revealing that he has nothing on beneath except his boots and a pair of bright orange boxer shorts that say "happy halloween." the kids go insane.}
<B>__{angle on loomis}
<A>__{making his way through the teeming crowd. walkie talkie in hand. the helicopter zooms overhead. wynn's voice squawks over garbled radio chatter. conducting a surveillance by air.}
<C>__{wynn }
<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{there's more people moving eastbound down old reservoir road past the elementary school.}
<C>__{loomis}
<P>__{(into walkie talkie)}
<D>__{any word on the location of the strodes?}
<C>__{wynn }
<D>__{no one's home. checked it out myself.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{good. i want around the clock surveillance on that house.}
<A>__{suddenly loomis is waylaid by a giant wall of a man sheriff holdt. loomis meets his fiery gaze.}
<C>__{holdt}
<D>__{i'm warning you, loomis stay out of my way. you may have had free reign when ben meeker was sheriff, god rest his soul, but i'm in charge now. and i'm not about to stand by and watch you turn this night into some kind of sadistic witch hunt.}
<C>__{wynn }
<D>__{sam, i just got word from the hospital. you'd better get over there right away.}
<C>__{loomis}
<P>__{(into walkie talkie)}
<D>__{what's wrong? what's happened to jamie?}
<C>__{wynn }
<D>__{i will meet you over there.}
<A>__{loomis tears off. holdt stares brazenly, throwing down his cigarette. crushes it under his boot and slowly follows him.}
