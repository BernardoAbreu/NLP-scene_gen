<A>__{a tiny apartment with a bed, chair, table, fridge, and not much else. one window has a broken pane and an old sheet neatly thumbtacked over it to keep the wind out. terry prescott comes in. he is twenty five years old: a real mess with a certain natural appeal. he wears old jeans, very old hiking boots, and a lumberjack style coat. he takes a wool hat off his head. his hair is longish and dirty. sheila sadler is sitting at the table by the fridge. she is barely eighteen, frail and damaged.}
