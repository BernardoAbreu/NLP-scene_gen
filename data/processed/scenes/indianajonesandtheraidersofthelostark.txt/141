<A>__{chaos. shliemann and the tall captain have been temporarily blinded by the light from the tabernacle. indy makes short work of his two escorts. he bashes their heads together. when only one goes down at this, indy uses the handle of his bullwhip, which has appeared instantly in his hand, to put the second one down. shliemann, hand on his eyes, aims his luger blindly at the scuffle. indy pushes the tall captain at shliemann, who fires on impact, killing the tall captain. indy knocks out shliemann. behind indy, the brilliant light and weird noise of the ark have suddenly ceased, but the tabernacle is ablaze and the fire has quickly spread to stacks of supplies on either side. smoke is already starting to fill the cavern. nazis are running around, yelling for firefighting water. a burning crate at the side of the tabernacle is pushed over, only to knock over a drum of heavy black oil. a river of flame shoots across the cement. indy grabs a rifle with bayonet from the prostrate body of one of his former escorts and runs back into the flaming tabernacle.}
