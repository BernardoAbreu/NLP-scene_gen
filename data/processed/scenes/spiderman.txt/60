<L>__{interior corridor to ock's lab day}
<A>__{ock, hiding his waldos under a white hospital robe. he stalls until he reaches the door. then one of his waldos peaks out and snaps open the new locks on the door.}
<L>__{interior control room night}
<A>__{ock, in a white hospital robe walks through the surreal debris. two waldos reach out and "sense" the ripples on opposite walls. he runs a hand through his hair.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{what a wreck. what a useless, wasted wreck. okey, dokey. we rebuild you, my damaged darling. bigger, better, hotter! a world class, super cyclotron!}
<A>__{he hears a noise behind him and reacts. and here comes weiner. bedraggled, shuffling through the control room door. he eyeballs the incredible wreckage.}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{there you are, doc... where have you been... whoa this place is messed up.}
<A>__{ock turns, waldos writhing. weiner sees them and kind of ducks, remembering how he was hit by them once.}
<C>__{weiner}
<P>__{(smirks)}
<D>__{whoa, doc! you look a little messed up yourself.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{where have you been, you imbecile?}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{i went to the wrestling...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{wrestling...}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{i went after the kid. you still want that parker guy's data, don't you?}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{well, did you get it?}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{no, i followed him... but i lost him in the crowd.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{lost him? you }
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{i will find him, maestro... i promise... soon... maybe by tomorrow.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{so how was the wrestling?}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{fantastic! there was this new wrestler... beat the mighty crusher. you won't believe it... a nothing of a guy... calls himself this stupid name... the amazing spider man... would you believe it?}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{spider man, huh? well, maybe i will just go and wrestle myself one of these days... with all my new arms... i'm sure i can beat crusher or any other monster.}
<A>__{suddenly ock throws out his waldos from under his long white coat, grabs weiner and, lifts him up in the air, smiles cynically and with cruelty!}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{will i beat him, this crusher, will i beat him or not?}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{no... no, please... i mean yes, yes... you'll beat him easily... let me down... please... i will do anything for you...}
