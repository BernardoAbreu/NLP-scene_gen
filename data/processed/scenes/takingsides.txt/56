<L>__{interior us officers' club night}
<A>__{band playing. couples dancing. david and steve at the bar, each with a drink in front of them, lost in their own thoughts. then: steve signs to the barkeeper to fill their glasses but david puts a hand over his glass. then:}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{can i ask you a favour, major?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{when you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{with more what? more what?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(flaring, hissing)}
<D>__{david, i don't understand a thing about you. you're a jew. are you a jew?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes, i'm a jew. but i like to think first i'm a human being.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{a human being, oh, good, i'm relieved, i thought you were going to say you were a music lover. this man, this great artist has made anti semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. i got letters.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti semitic remark and i will show you the gates of paradise.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(over reacting and overlapping)}
<D>__{what is it with you, david? where are your feelings? where's your hatred, your disgust? where's your fucking outrage, david?}
<A>__{he starts to go, then comes back to them.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{think of your parents, david, and then think of him conducting 'happy birthday, dear adolf'. i mean, for chrissake, whose side are you on? grow up! just grow the fuck up!}
<A>__{the customers stare at him as he stalks out. the band plays.}
