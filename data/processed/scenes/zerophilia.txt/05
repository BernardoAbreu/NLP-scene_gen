<L>__{interior road rage garage day}
<A>__{a small, run down service garage, crammed with tires, tools and discarded car parts. luke's truck idles in the service bay, billowing smoke. max, nineteen, lean, in overalls, with shoulder length hair and edgy eyes, wipes his greasy hands on a rag. dripping with masculinity, he swaggers around the truck, chewing gum, wielding a pneumatic torque wrench, which he occasionally revs for emphasis.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i can do the gasket for twenty bucks. but new t sprocks, for this thing? two, three hundred, maybe?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{shit. can i hold off on that?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no skin off my ass. but a few days, weeks, your whole transmission could blow.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{ah, jeez. i shouldn't got this.}
<A>__{max considers, sets his baseball cap on the truck fender and}
<B>__{sighs.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{four hundred seventy five horsepower. twenty eight inch wheels. it's a classic. let me dig around out back. maybe we got a used set.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{that'd be great. thanks.}
<A>__{max disappears through a squeaky door at the back. luke picks up a rag and wipes fingerprints off the fender. he sits, impatient for max to return. he examines max's cap, tries it on. he picks up the torque wrench, swaggers about, trying to look macho, in the manner of max. he spins around and revs the wrench, catching sight of michelle, twenty, watching him from out front in jeans and t shirt, with warm, confident eyes. luke swallows, wide eyed, a deer in headlights. he sets down the torque wrench.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{it's not my wrench. it's my truck.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{what's wrong with it?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, just needs a new gasket and a couple t sprocks. the flanges are sheared off. no big deal.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{you have to watch my brother, max. he's sellin' you "t sprocks?"}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{there's no such thing. last week he sold mrs. gustafson a whole set: six hundred bucks. my name's michelle.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{from new york. poli sci transfer. i sort of asked around campus.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you've prob'ly already got a stalker, huh?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{luke stares, awkward.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you heard about cafe lunizia? italian? they got new york style pizza. make you feel at home.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{you askin' me out?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, well, uh, definitely!}
<A>__{an suv pulls up at the gas pump, stuffed with keenan and other guys. chad, exuding supreme self confidence, calls over to luke as he pumps gas.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{hey, spanky, let's go! look forward to kickin' your puck ass.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{my ride.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{your name's "spanky?"}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no, puck ass, but people just call me luke. we're beatin' his frat boy team in street hockey. pisses 'em off.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{i will talk to max. tell him to just replace the gasket.}
<A>__{luke's breathing grows heavier.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{thanks. so, what do you think? i will just sit there while you eat. i won't even talk.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{look, i just split up with this total amoeba.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, i'm a paramecium. that's way more evolved. i'm practically pond scum.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{maybe i will give you a call when the truck's ready.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{great. you mean to go out, right?}
<A>__{michelle smiles, and walks out through the squeaky door at the back. keenan approaches.}
<C>__{keenan}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{whoa. that was her! jesus, you're sweatin' like crazy.}
<A>__{luke sits, nods 'yes,' wipes beads of sweat from his brow.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{we're goin' out.}
<A>__{keenan gives him a high five. luke smiles, catching his breath.}
