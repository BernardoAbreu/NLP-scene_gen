<A>__{something catches the light on the ground beside them. don reaches down and lifts a small metal fragment in his hand. metal close. on it is the familiar logo of the united space agency.}

<D>__{could these be from the probe?}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{no, major, when the hell are we?}
<A>__{suddenly don is hit in the chest with a plasma charge, goes flying. john ducks and rolls, firing his laser from behind the cover of a rocky mound. john goes up to take another shot, is bit with a powerful electrical blast, falling hard. still.}
