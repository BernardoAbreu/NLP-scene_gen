<L>__{interior corridor day}
<A>__{cut to sam coming out of his office, turning right and walking to the next door, the nameplate of which reads: officer dv 048. as is his custom, sam opens the door without knocking.}
<L>__{63a interior lime's office day 63a}
<T>__{cut :}
<A>__{to sam's pov. here is an office much like his. it's the other half of his room bisected by the partition wall. the other half of his desk is occupied by a slimy looking, round headed little junior executive wholly occupied with trying to drag a bit more of the desk into his office. he is unaware of sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{lime startled, lets go of his desk and vents his irritation on sam whom he mistakes for someone else.}
<C>__{lime}
<D>__{no, you can't have any more chairs! there's only one left in here now, and i need that to sit on!}
<P>__{(realizing his mistake)}
<D>__{oh ... er, sorry. who are you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sam lowry.}
<C>__{lime}
<P>__{(becoming unctuous)}
<D>__{ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!}
<P>__{(he advances toward sam}
<D>__{with hand out to shake.}
<P>__{shaking hands)}
<D>__{my name's lime. harvey lime. welcome to expediting.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{ah.}
<P>__{(he pauses looking around)}
<D>__{would you mind if i borrowed your computer console?}
<C>__{lime}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i will bring it back in ten minutes.}
<C>__{lime}
<D>__{you want to take my console into your office?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{lime}
<P>__{(after a moment's consideration)}
<D>__{i will tell you what .... you tell me what and i will do it for. i'm a bit of a whizz on this thing.}
<P>__{(indicates computer console)}
<A>__{sam hesitates, but sees that there's no other way.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(taking print out on jill from his pocket)}
<D>__{alright. there's someone i want to check out. a woman called gillian layton.}
<C>__{lime}
<P>__{(leering)}
<D>__{a woman eh? i see.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(trying to ignore this)}
<D>__{i know her age and distinguishing marks. but i need an address or a place of work or something}
<C>__{lime}
<P>__{(continuing to leer)}
<D>__{this is your dream girl, is it?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(recovering)}
<D>__{look, let me use the console for a few minutes.}
<C>__{lime}
<P>__{(trying to be jocular)}
<D>__{you must be joking }
<P>__{(entirely unconvincing)}
<D>__{when there's a woman involved there's no stopping me. now, let me have that sheet.}
<A>__{he takes jill's print out sheet from sam and begins to punch the keys laboriously with one finger. nothing happens.}
<C>__{lime}
<D>__{sod it, it's broken!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you haven't switched it on.}
<C>__{lime}
<D>__{oh yes. look you're putting me off, standing there! go back to your office and i will give you a knock when i've finished.}
<A>__{sam hesitates, but goes.}
<C>__{lime}
<D>__{go on. i'm not going to elope with her.}
<A>__{sam exits.}
