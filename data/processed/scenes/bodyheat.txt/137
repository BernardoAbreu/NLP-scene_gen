<L>__{exterior interior cadillac interstate night}
<A>__{the traffic on racine's side of the interstate has slowed. there's an accident up ahead. the police car that passed racine is on the scene, but the lone cop is not enough. some passing motorists have pulled over to help with the wreck and direct traffic. the fog is aglow with flashing red and white lights and burning flares. a man signals for racine to stop. the cars in the opposite lanes are allowed to pass through. racine keeps his head down. a stocky trucker comes out of the glowing fog and walks up to the cadillac. he leans down into the driver's window.}

<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i don't have them. i told you.}
<A>__{the stocky trucker gives him a disgusted look and stands up.}
<C>__{stocky trucker}
<D>__{don't put yourself out.}
<A>__{the man in the road ahead signals for racine to pull around into the opposite lanes and move on. tracking along beside the cadillac, racine moves slowly through the nightmare scene. figures move by carrying lights and tools. the injured cry out in pain. three cars are meshed in crumpled steel. a clutch of onlookers are outlined against the beams of headlights... racine might as well be driving into hell.}
