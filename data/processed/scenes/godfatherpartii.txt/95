<T>__{what he sees:}
<A>__{the white blob of fanucci opening the door and cursing in italian as he throws the cat out.}
<B>__{view on vito}
<A>__{squeezing the trigger; the muffled, but still loud blast resounding in the building.}
<B>__{view on fanucci}
<A>__{he holds onto the door frame, trying to stand erect, trying to reach for his gun. the force of his struggle has torn the buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose. his gun is exposed but so is a spidery vein on the white shirtfront of his stomach. carefully, as if plunging a needle into this vein, vito corleone fires a second bullet. fanucci falls to his knees, propping the door open, giving a terrible groan. we begin to hear the voices of girls inside the apartment. vito quickly opens his wallet, removes the two hundred, quickly fires one last bullet into fanucci's sweaty cheek. now the towel the gun was wrapped with catches fire, literally on vito's hand; quickly he throws it to the ground, stamps it out...and disappears upward.}
