<A>__{pi has rigged an additional line between the open end of the lifeboat and his raft.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{for castaways who must share their lifeboats with large dangerous carnivores it's advisable to establish a territory as your own. the following course of action is recommended. step one: choose a day when waves are moderate but regular. step two: with the lifeboat facing into the waves, making the ride as comfortable as possible, blow your whistle soothingly. step three: turn the lifeboat sideways to the waves, accompanied by harsh aggressive use of the whistle. with sufficient repetition, the animal will associate the sound of the whistle with the discomfort of seasickness. similar methods have long been used by circus trainers, though they generally lack access to rough seas.}
<A>__{he reels in this line, turning the boat sideways to the waves. the rocking increases. pi blows the whistle several times harshly ("warning" signal) as the rocking increases. from within the boat, he hears the tiger groan. he grabs the original lifeline that connects the raft to the boat and hauls himself in. pi grins, spits out the whistle.}

<P>__{(a ringmaster's call:)}
<D>__{let the trumpets blare, let the drum rolls begin! prepare to be amazed! here it is, for your enjoyment and instruction, the show you've been waiting for all your life will soon begin!}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{are you ready for the miracle of it? well, then i give to you...}
<A>__{pi lets go of the second line, raising his hand with a flourish.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{... the astounding bengal tiger!}
<A>__{he pulls the raft next to the tarp end of the lifeboat. the tiger crawls out from under the tarp, violently ill.}
<C>__{pi }
<P>__{(rocking the boat:)}
<D>__{hello, richard parker. sorry about the choppy ride.}
<A>__{pi pulls himself onto the bow. richard parker tries to lift his head, then groans, giving it up. pi lifts the whistle to his mouth and blows it repeatedly as he advances to the front edge of the tarp, opens his fly and pisses in a straight line across the midpoint of the boat.}
<C>__{pi }
<P>__{(pointing:)}
<D>__{mine! you understand? yours mine!}
<P>__{(he blows his whistle)}
<D>__{you understand?}
<A>__{he steps back to observe the effect of this provocation on the seasick tiger. richard parker staggers to the edge of the tarp. he takes a deep sniff and winces, groaning, his tongue hanging out in distaste. the tiger turns away from pi, facing the stern. pi thinks the battle is won until the tiger lifts his tail and sprays him with a tremendous burst of urine.}
<D>__{pi (reading v.o.) (cont'd) step four: disregard steps one through three.}
