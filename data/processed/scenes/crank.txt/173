<A>__{they’ve pulled up across the street from a hardware store. chev drags his carcass across the street, oblivious to the traffic swerving and braking to avoid him, and stumbles in. eve stays in the car for a few seconds, looking lost, then pulls herself together and gets out. she follows chev’s path, crossing the street through traffic. store employees and customers start bailing out of the store in a panic as she approaches the front doors. she walks through them and inside.}
