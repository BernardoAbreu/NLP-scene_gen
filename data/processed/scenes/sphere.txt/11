<L>__{interior tech room}
<A>__{barnes leads norman through the room, crammed with video monitors, screens, and grids. officers talk into radios. technicians work on computers.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{we're moving fast considering the storm.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{storm? what storm?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{a cyclone's on it's way in. i thought they would have told you on the phone.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{they didn't tell me anything.}
<A>__{norman tries to keep pace...}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{we've had divers working around the clock. take a look at this...}
<A>__{angle on a large video screen shows a diver walking on the ocean floor, holding a bright artificial flashlight.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{how deep is he?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{a thousand feet.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{a thousand? an airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water i don't want to sound pessimistic here, but i assume there are no survivors.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{survivors? no, i wouldn't think so.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{then why am i here?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what do you need me for?}
<A>__{on the video screen the diver shines his light on a large, metallic}
<B>__{object.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{what crashed wasn't an airplane, dr. johnson. it's a bit larger than that.}
<A>__{barnes walks toward a technician, sitting at a keyboard.}
<C>__{barnes}
<P>__{(to technician)}
<D>__{bring up the grid, would you?}
<A>__{angle on the monitor as an image of the craft begins to form.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what is it? a military spacecraft? like a shuttle or satellite?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{something like that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that doesn't surprise you?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{not really, no. something of the military crashes in the ocean it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret... when did it crash?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{as best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{four hundred? you're kidding, right?}
<A>__{angle on the monitor showing a grid depicting an image of the craft and a small layer of rock above it.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{see this? coral. geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{geologists?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year }
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{ wait a second }
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{ dating the crash at least that old.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{hold on }
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{maybe older }
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{ there's got to be some mistake here a four hundred year old military spacecraft? there's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{extraordinary, isn't it?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's impossible.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{i'm afraid it is dr. johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.}
