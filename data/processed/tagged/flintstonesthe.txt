<A>__{an eerie carboniferous forest dawn dew drips from strange multi leafed plants. giant dragonflies buzz and hum to and fro. bubbles rise from a still pond, and weird lungfish move onto the land. (the third one out carries a little suitcase.) camera pans past the lungfish to a muddy shore. with a dramatic musical sting, we discover a set of strange, hideous clawprints. the camera follows these, then widens to reveal the make of these footprints: a seven foot tall and fearful beast we will call the xenosaurus. it looks around menacingly. (oddly, it's carrying a canvas sack, but we don't stress this.) suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs over the xenosaurus.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{dazed, the xenosaurus gets up. as it does, we realize that we aren't deep in some primeval forest, but on the shoulder of a gravel highway. a stone road sign reads bedrock 1 2 mile. rock vegas, babylon & eden next three exits. now, the camera cranes up above the sign and we see bedrock! nestled incongruously in a savage landscape, the charming protosuburbia gleams in the dawn's early spielberg light. the xenosaurus grabs its sack and some silverware spills out. then it runs off into the bushes and out of sight.}

<B>__{following the round stones}
<A>__{they reach the ends of their respective paths, dislodging a stick... that releases a coiled rope which in turn spins a turntable which holds a little wooly mammoth. as it begins to spin around, it squirts water out of its snout. elsewhere on the lawn, other spinning mammoths repeat this performance. after a moment, they gradually slow their revolutions. the one closest to the house scrunches its trunk with a groan.}

<L>__{interior bedroom new angle}
<A>__{two shapes are visible under the bedclothes: one is a great snoring bulge, the other is a svelte and lithe shape. as the bell continues ringing, the larger bulge grunts, moans, pulls a pillow over its head, and then finally gropes under the bed for a slipper. the slipper is thrown without aiming }

<A>__{he staggers back up to his perch, and then notices for the first time that the dial on the side is pointed not to "alarm" but to "alarm & radio." the woodpecker sighs, looks over at the bed where snoring is still emanating. then the bird swings a little telescope around to point out the window. woodpecker's telescope iris shot as the 'scope pans and focuses, finally settling on a distant stone building marked radio station b rok. perched on top of the wooden radio tower are a monkey and an octopus. the monkey holds up cue cards which the octopus reads, and then waves nautical semaphore flags.}

<D>__{in the news, bedrock civic and business leaders met yesterday to discuss the growing kibble crisis. radio woodpecker (o.s.) (cont'd) ecological activist ralph naderock warned that if new supplies of kibble are not found, our animal powered civilization itself may be threatened.}

<A>__{wham! dino reappears, bounding through the window and knocking fred onto the floor. once again dino is happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously unresponsive owner. fred struggles to avoid the slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill, looks out.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{ oh, look, everybody, the mailman is here }
<A>__{"yi yi yi yi!" dino buys it again, runs to the door, lets himself out. this time fred puts a chair against the door. meanwhile, wilma turns at the sound of the toaster popping up. we see that the "claws" we saw earlier were the actual claws of a lobster in a little fireproof suit who is tucked inside the toaster. as wilma takes the toast, the lobster blows on his claws, wincing, then looks towards the camera.}
<C>__{lobster}
<D>__{well, it beats working in a seafood restaurant...}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(taking the toast)}
<D>__{thanks, wilma...}

<D>__{arnold! arnold! don't aim at the house please, not at the house }
<A>__{wham! fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams into the window frame, smashing a flowerpot, taking out a chunk of wall, and continuing diagonally through the kitchen and out another window. fred follows this action in time to see his driveway through the other window the rock paper drops like a foul shot, rips through the canvas roof of fred's car, and then bangs a huge dent in the hood.}

(interestingly, a number of these anticipate leonardo da vinci's work). many of the models are made of a strange celadon green material. fred watches, skeptical, as barney presses the car hood into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone.}

<A>__{indeed, it's on the back wall in a closed box marked fire hose in case of emergency break glass. fred and barney take a step towards it, but the fire quickly spreads and cuts them off. helpless, they step back. with a thunderous roar, the two slate scrapers visible through what's left of the picture window collapse. then the big statue of slate just outside the window begins to decompose. it falls in on itself like a sand sculpture in a storm... finally, for a split second it is, well, life sized, and then the head of the statue snaps loose, crashes through the only remaining pane of glass here ... rolls up to slate's feet. pause. everyone looks at everyone else. this is it: titanic time. fred embraces wilma... barney embraces betty. their kids are pulled into the clinch. even slate takes mrs. slate's hand. talk about grace under pressure... and speaking of }

<A>__{he's started yelping because he's realized his arm is on fire, and now he jumps up and the others begin beating at the arm with anything in their hands, and then fred suddenly pushes away from them, stands there with a small flame flickering on his forearm like a rock vegas stage magician.}

<D>__{ wait a minute i don't feel anything at all }
<A>__{with his other "claw" he slaps tentatively at the flames, and then confidentially snuffs it out.}
