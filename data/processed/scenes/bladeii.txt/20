<L>__{interior scud's workshop night}
<A>__{santa's workshop by way of soldier of fortune. industrial equipment is strewn everywhere. mills, old furnaces, gutted vehicles, an ad hoc surgical theater. we also notice the big rig which scud had been piloting. because of various leaking overhead pipes, the floor is slick with a sheen of water. blade kills his charger, looking around as he climbs out.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{scud!}
<A>__{blade's voice echoes throughout the cavernous room.}
<C>__{scud }
<D>__{lock up your daughters, people }
<B>__{angle on scud}
<A>__{a handlebar moustached, weed sucking stoner. thrift store chic, wearing a jimmy walker "dyn o mite!" t shirt.}
<C>__{scud }
<D>__{the dark knight returns.}
<A>__{scud is lowering himself down from the ceiling on a rope and pulley system where he'd been suspended in a safety harness, doing some kind of electrical wiring job. he reaches the floor and unclips himself. we notice he's wearing a surfer's charm around his neck that's been strung with vampire fangs. scud pulls a half smoked roach from behind his ear, using a lighter in the shape of a woman's torso to fire up. the flame jets from a hole in one of her tits. he takes a spicoli sized hit and offers the roach to blade.}
<C>__{scud }
<D>__{little toke of the smokage, b?}
<A>__{blade slaps it from his hand.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{knock it off. we've got work to do.}
<A>__{blade opens the trunk. scud joins him.}
<B>__{whistler}
<A>__{is inside. blade unfastens the hood, slipping it off. immediately, whistler sits up, lunging at blade!}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{fuck me!}
<A>__{blade gets whistler in a headlock, choking him as he drags him out of the trunk. it's like trying to wrestle a rabid pit bull. he looks to scud, annoyed.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you going to stand there crapping your pants or are you going to help me?!}
<A>__{scud steps forward, tentative. together, he and blade drag whistler kicking and screaming across the workshop, forcing him into a small, cell like room.}
