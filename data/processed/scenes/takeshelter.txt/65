<L>__{exterior gas station late afternoon}
<A>__{the relatively new gas station sits just off the interstate. curtis stands at the pump filling up his truck. he watches the numbers next to the dollar sign roll higher. he looks back at the busy freeway. cars passing. the pump stops. the final amount reads, "$68.79". he hangs the hose back onto the pump and pulls a cell phone from his pocket. he dials and waits.}

<A>__{curtis, phone still at his ear, turns and watches the horizon. the sun hangs low in the sky. a reddish haze.}
