<A>__{we're looking at the back of laughing man's leather chair. we hear his cackle, as well as stuey gluck's tortured screams and a horrible power tool noise. we can see the usual bright interrogation spotlight, and a couple of extra goons watching the goings on, but stuey and his actual torturer are hidden by laughing man's chair.}
