<L>__{exterior alleyways day}
<A>__{indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to avoid hitting it. it continues into the next alley. up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the alley, its metal lift rods extended to pick up a dumpster.}
<C>__{carson }
<D>__{oh, shit...}
<A>__{the duplicate van crashes into the garbage truck and explodes.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{carson, horrified, jumps out of his car. robbins and sabatini run up. they have to hold carson away from the burning van. dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick. colonel lee, wide eyed with anger, gets in carson's face.}
<C>__{colonel lee}
<D>__{you should not have interfered!}
<A>__{carson shoves colonel lee out of his way, hard.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{i'm in no mood...}
