<L>__{interior fitch senior high school calculus class day}
<A>__{mike slips inside the empty classroom, slathers krazy glue all over stan's desktop and chair. mike sits just as the rest of the class files in. stan kisses maggie and takes his seat. stan leans on his desk, placing a forearm and a hand on the sticky desktop. he catches mike looking back at him and gives him a cocky wink. mike winks back knowingly. mike's phone beeps. he checks it... a pix message... 3 perfect asses in tiny bikini bottoms. a wide eyed mike spins in his seat to find the wonder bras smiling at him. mr. adams enters.}

<D>__{settle, people.}
<A>__{adams scribbles a large equation on the blackboard.}
<C>__{mr. adams }
<D>__{this was your homework. who can come up here and solve this for me?}
<A>__{anyone? blank, uninterested faces. scattered giggles. adams tosses the chalk angrily on his desk.}
<C>__{mr. adams }
<D>__{not one person. fine. miss o'donnell. come up here and dazzle us with your brilliance.}
<A>__{maggie rises nervously from her seat, shuffles to the front of the class. as she passes stan we see... stan lifts his fingers from the desktop... it's wet... he places his wet fingers to the tip of his nose and smells. when stan tries to remove his fingers from his nose... they stick. stan tries to raise his other arm... stuck.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{stuck!!! i'm stuck! my fingers!}
<A>__{stan stands, hunched... the chair glued to his butt. the desk attached to his forearm and his fingers stuck to his nose. the kids and mike burst out laughing, break out their video phones as stan fumbles around, dragging the desk, panicking.}
<C>__{mr. adams}
<D>__{sit down, stan! sit down!}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{it's glue! i'm glued to everything!}
