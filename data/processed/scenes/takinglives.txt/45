<L>__{interior apartment day (an hour later)}
<A>__{grace watches a criminalist bag a comb from the medicine cabinet. a couple hairs entwined in its teeth. in the kitchen another criminalist dusts for prints. reynaud taking pictures with a large still camera. laval knocks on the walls. laval moves a picture frame. a photograph falls out. laval picks it up with surgical gloves. insert photo: a dead ringer for costa's sketch, carousing in a thai bar. laval shows grace.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{resembles the man costa sketched.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{have you released him? you don't want your star witness steaming in a holding cell.}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{he went home twenty minutes ago. agent grace, where do you think monsieur edwards is?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i bet monsieur edwards is in a deep grave with square corners like messieurs kohler and ford. which looks like all the victims. maybe he's subconsciously killing himself.}
<A>__{grace finds a guitar case. opens it. it's a mobile office; it has postage stamps. postcards. assorted stationery, different address labels. neat, organized. holiday cards. a cd titled: "learn flamenco guitar." hundreds of practice signatures. forged documents. victim's personal effects.}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{we'll take that with us.}
<P>__{(in french)}
<D>__{put a number and seal on that case.}
<A>__{reynaud snaps pictures of the guitar case. grace is absorbing everything this little apartment can tell her. bonding with the space. she smells a pillow. thinking.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{ever see a hermit crab?}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's a crab that lives in the shells of dead sea snails.}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{yes, yes. they have one big claw and curl up tight.}
<A>__{laval takes a long, sharpened screwdriver from his jacket. begins prying off a door molding. grace sits at the kitchen table.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{when they outgrow an old shell, they search for a new empty shell, crawl up to it and quickly switch.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{they live in these beautiful shells because they have these soft ugly bodies. they couldn't survive without the shells. neither can the guy we're after.}
<A>__{laval exposes several mini dv and micro cassettes hidden under the molding.}
