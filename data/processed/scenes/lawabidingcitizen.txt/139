<L>__{exterior county jail annex day}
<A>__{a steel door opens. clyde steps out, shackled, blinking at daylight. he comes down a short flight of steps... camera comes around to reveal his surroundings: not within prison walls, but rather behind the prison a loading area we haven't seen, comprised of fences and razor wire. nick walks in the rear gate, passed through by warden iger himself this is clearly an off the books meeting. nick and clyde walk to each other, meet halfway.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{interesting location you've chosen.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i thought we'd have some privacy.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{for what? a talk? or...}
<P>__{(gazes around)}
<D>__{maybe you've decided to take detective dunnigan's advice.}
<A>__{he's noticing guards atop the prison wall and surrounding roofs all with sniper rifles.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{be the perfect place for it. outside the wall. look like you were shot trying to escape.}
<B>__{wide angle from above}
<A>__{nick and clyde below. a scope suddenly rises into frame, turning our shot into a sniper scope pov, jumping clyde's face into magnification. he smiles in the crosshairs...}
<B>__{resume nick and clyde}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{you have some kind of signal worked out? you scratch your nose and blam, i'm a goner?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{might solve all your problems. what's stopping you? afraid of the blowback?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no. it's to prove a pointerior}
<P>__{(off clyde's look)}
<D>__{just because i have the power, doesn't mean i have to use it.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{ah. nice. good one.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{one can show mercy.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{mercy. right.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah. so why don't you?}
<A>__{we see clyde's brain bend a little trying to wrap his head around it. it's almost painful for him.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i think we've come a little too far for that, haven't we, nick? i mean, what do i say? sorry, my bad? which way to the execution chamber?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{don't give me that. death doesn't scare you.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(smiles "right")}
<D>__{yeah, but...we're in the flow of this now. you cry havoc, you let slip the dogs of war, you go with it. you don't just stop because someone says hey wait. by then the dogs are dragging you.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{until one side admits defeat. what if i did that? what if i said...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...you were right. i was wrong. what if i say i should have prosecuted both men ten years ago?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i'd say you're making progress. you should have, you know. prosecuted both.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'd have lost.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{with your head held high. and without any blame from me.}
<A>__{nick's cell rings he turns away, answers:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{she is? great news. i will stop on my way back. and royce? put some get well flowers in her room, they sell 'em in the lobby. thanks.}
<P>__{(hangs up, baleful)}
<D>__{six hours in surgery.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{but she's okay good. miss lowell is a fine young woman.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{oh, hey...your wife and little girl get out of town all right?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(beat, staring)}
<D>__{you asking that question makes me want to scratch my nose.}
<A>__{clyde glances around at the snipers with a laugh.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{just a guess. it's what i would do. get 'em out, make sure they're safe.}
<P>__{(reproachful)}
<D>__{c'mon. like i'd ever have hurt them anyway.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{there are limits. even in war. i may be many things, nick. but i'm not clarence darby. i'm not rupert ames. i'm not that kind of monster.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what kind are you?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{not the kind who'd hurt your wife and child. christ, look at me. mine were my salvation then they were killed and all i had left was this. life without them in this fucking charnel house world.}
<A>__{pause. drawing close:}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{it hurt to lose them, didn't it? your family. even knowing they'd come back.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{imagine knowing they wouldn't.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i can't. i can't imagine that.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{good. i envy you. for me, knowing mine won't come back is the only thing that's crowded my thoughts for ten years. if i could take a rusty knife and cut out that part of my brain, i would.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i won't make any more deals with murderers. if hearing that makes a difference...if that was the point of all this...you've won.}
<A>__{we see clyde's brain hurting again he's trying to believe that, would like to believe that...}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{counselor. i have no doubt, as we stand here, that you really believe that. i wish i could.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{are we done? you gonna scratch your nose, or can i go?}
<A>__{silence now. nothing left to say. they turn and walk in opposite directions...}
