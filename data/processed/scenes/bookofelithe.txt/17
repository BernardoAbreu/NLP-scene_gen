<L>__{exterior desert town main street day}
<A>__{a large crowd of townsfolk several hundred strong has assembled outside the palladium theater. an armed crew of carnegie's goons keeps watch over the crowd. carnegie stands on a balcony above the theater marquee. he treats the balcony like a pulpit, speaking through a microphone connected to an old pa system that carries his words to the far reaches of the crowd.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{i want you all to remember how far we've come together. and how far we still can go, if only we believe. when i brought us here to this oasis this promised land we knew there would be hardships. knew there would be sacrifices. but we also knew that we were creating for ourselves a world where we could be safe from the horrors of the forsaken lands beyond our borders.}
<A>__{the crowd listens intently, hanging on carnegie's every word. he is an incredibly charismatic and persuasive speaker his cultivated image and inspiring, confident delivery remind us of a television evangelist.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{and i want you all to remember above all that it is not the water with which we have been blessed that is the true lifeblood of this town... but faith.}
<A>__{this sends a murmur of discontent through the crowd. many don't like where they suspect this may be going. carnegie senses this and dials up his rhetoric delivering it now with the fire brand passion of an old time baptist preacher.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{it is our faith that sustains us, brothers and sisters! hallelujah!}
<A>__{the crowd is divided. many return the "hallelujah" with varying levels of conviction. others are not convinced. but carnegie continues unabated, selling it harder than ever.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{and mark me, the ultimate validation of that faith is coming! the sacred word of our lord that formed the world before and will reform it once again is coming to this town to bring it succor, bring it nourishment, bring it new life! for the almighty himself has spoken unto me and promised it!}
<A>__{carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker it's almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his words. his apparently unshakable belief is infectious.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{in the meantime, he has asked us all to be patient. to walk the hard road of the faithful just a little longer. and to do that, we must give just a little more.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{water rations will be halved until further notice.}
<A>__{this sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the crowd this news has not been received well at all. some still "keep the faith" but many more are perturbed by this. carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{i understand your frustration. the road to salvation is a difficult one but what lies at the end of that road is a greater glory, beyond anything you can imagine.}
<A>__{a discontented villager steps forward, pushing through the crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at carnegie.}
<C>__{discontented villager}
<D>__{we've heard this all before! when are you going to }
<A>__{carnegie's goons quickly move in and efficiently silence the man, removing him from the crowd. dissent is not tolerated here. carnegie goes on speaking as if nothing had happened.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{i know each and every one of you will understand the necessity of this action. it was faith that built this town and faith that will sustain it even through the dark times that may lie ahead. but it is always darkest before dawn and the new dawn is coming.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{may god go with you all.}
<A>__{carnegie steps back inside, leaving the crowd to talk among themselves, clearly mixed about what they have heard. as the assembled townsfolk disperse, four motorcycles roar into town and pull up outside the palladium. as the riders dismount, one detaches a cloth satchel from his bike's cargo rack. the four riders head inside. they each have long, straggly hair and brutish expressions. we recognize them now as the biker bandits who killed the couple on the road under the freeway overpass.}
