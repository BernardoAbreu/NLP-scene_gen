<A>__{climbing the stairs... suddenly stops. a small white ball on the stairs. he bends down and picks it up... a pearl.}
<C>__{kimble}
<D>__{helen?}
<A>__{silence. he can see directly into the bedroom. it's quiet. too quiet. he notices a lampshade on the floor. upstairs hall night kimble moves slowly to the opened doorway. and just before he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door. adrenal surge. kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun free. before kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him. the attacker immediately goes for the gun. kimble grabs a leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the landing and over the edge three flights to the entry hall below. sirens can be heard. distant but approaching. the man kicks free and tries to flee. this time kimble catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. to his shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow. kimble looks at the arm in his hands it's hollow. electrodes are visible inside then to the man's unreadable face... the sirens are louder... before kimble can recover, the one armed man knocks kimble down and grabs back his arm. he runs down the stairs. kimble pulls himself up and starts to follow but is stopped by a voice behind him in the bedroom...}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{he's here... still in the house...}
