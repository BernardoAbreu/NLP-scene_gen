<A>__{smiley stands staring at the owl prideaux killed, which is now stuffed, keeping guard from the top of a bookshelf. prideaux sits at a desk drinking the vodka.}
<C>__{prideaux}
<D>__{i held on as long as i could, to give everyone else time to get the hell out of there. (beat) did they?}

<C>__{prideaux }
<D>__{my networks in hungary. did they get out?}
<C>__{smiley}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no. they were blown. the story is you blew them to save your own skin.}
<A>__{prideaux nods, makes an odd gesture as if he's about to rise, but doesn't move. his expression hasn't changed, but inside him something has just been decided.}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{what was your last line of defence?}
<C>__{prideaux}
<D>__{the mole. control's crazy theory. i was going to bury that so deep, they'd never get it out of me. which was a joke.}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{prideaux}
<D>__{because they already knew. they wanted to know how far control had got in his investigation.}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{what else?}
<C>__{prideaux}
<D>__{circus gossip. was percy's wife still drinking, who was bland screwing in the office. that sort of thing.}

<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{what did he say about me?}
<C>__{prideaux}

<C>__{prideaux }
<P>__{(still looking to the side)}
<D>__{i told him to go to hell.}
<C>__{prideaux }

<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{try and put it all behind you, jim.}
<A>__{he makes to leave.}
<C>__{prideaux}
