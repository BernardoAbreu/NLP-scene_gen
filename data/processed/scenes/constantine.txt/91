<A>__{the morgue is seen across the street. the guard that chased hennessey is just outside.}

<D>__{security guard spotted him near the body, chased him out.}
<A>__{we move past angela standing with weiss. around them is a complete shambles of fine dining }
<C>__{weiss}
<D>__{he comes over here, makes a run at the entire menu and pow deflates like a fricken macy's day balloon.}
<A>__{ come to rest on john's shattered face. he stares down at hennessey. now yards of loose flesh sunken over an assemblage of bones. only that ragged black tie he wore is familiar now. john leans down to the remains of his friend. a cop starts to intervene but angela blocks him. let him be. john has trouble taking this in, reluctantly reaches into hennessey's coat pocket finds the protective amulet he himself removed from his friend. that's even more crushing.}

<D>__{why didn't you call me, you fat sonna bitch...}
<A>__{john lowers his head, then spots blood stains on one of hennessey's hands. he opens the fingers, studies the fork wound. the blood is already drying over it. john reaches over to the mess of dishes on the floor and grabs a melting ice cube. he pushes it into hennessey's hand, wiping away the dried blood. it quickly becomes apparent this isn't random stabbings. this is a shape. john takes a napkin, lays it on the palm and presses. residual blood creates a symbol onto the napkin. it's the same circular symbol we saw on isabel's wrist. john doesn't know what it is, but he knows it's important.}
