<L>__{interior sarah sorkin's beach house night}
<A>__{pasta being cooked. salad being tossed. wine glasses are filled. it's girl's night at the beach.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{it was like that scene in the godfather. frankie pentangeli is called to testify against the family. and he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his brother. they brought the brother from sicily. and frankie can't say a word. he can't testify. that's what it was like seeing pat in there. i couldn't even have ruth cross examine her.}
<C>__{ramona}
<D>__{why do you think she did it?}
<C>__{marylin}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{maybe she wanted a free trip to la. maybe they offered her money. massey is very seductive. who knows.}
<C>__{ramona}
<D>__{maybe they put a horse head in her bed?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{that stinks. they left you with absolutely nothing. it makes you wonder about the entire legal system. like rodney king.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{they bought her speech. if i was only in it for rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.}
<C>__{ramona}
<D>__{that doesn't make sense. it's like punishing you for being goal oriented.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{well, you can live here as long as you want. do you have any plans?}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{nothing specific, but i will have my own place soon.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{so, marylin. is that what you said when you were a little girl?}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{probably. every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. what was i supposed to say. anthropologist?}
<C>__{ramona}
<D>__{i begged you to have a baby!}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{in the godfather, after the courtroom scene, frankie pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you're not...}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{no. i will see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.}
