<L>__{exterior suburban house morning}
<A>__{luke hops down from the truck cab, fixes his shirt and hair, trying to look nonchalant as he rings the doorbell. hearing something behind him, he turns as max punches him in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you son of a bitch, stay the hell away from my sister!}
<A>__{luke gasps for air.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{you don't say a word?! you just leave her sittin' there?!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i came to apologize.}
<A>__{max shoves him across the yard.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{get out a' here! she's not home, anyway.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{will you tell her i came by?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no. she's honest with you, so you bolt? and then what, you wake up feelin' sorry for her?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no! is that what she thinks? i left 'cause a' what she said? that's crazy! she's like the most incredible girl i ever met!}
<A>__{max sneers, skeptical.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{i had this 'pasta quattro funghi' four mushroom. it took me a while to even figure it out, but i think someone put shrooms in it, or somehow they got in there by mistake. i was hallucinating and everything.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{amazes even me, a guy's capacity to be a world class asshole. fortunately, i'm familiar with the cause.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{will you please just tell her i came by? forget it. i will catch up with her on my own.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no. you won't.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{look, i'm gonna' see her again, if she'll see me. i don't care what the fuck you say about it.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{oh, really?}
<A>__{they face off.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah, really.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you get near her, i will feed your nuts to the neighbor's dog!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what kind a' dog is it?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i mean, is it a pitbull, or what?}
<A>__{caught off guard, a smile escapes max.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{i'm crazy about her.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{shrooms, huh?}
<A>__{luke nods 'yes.'}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{i will tell her you came by.}
<A>__{luke nods, appreciative.}
