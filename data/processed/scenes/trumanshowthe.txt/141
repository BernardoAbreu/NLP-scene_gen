<L>__{interior control room night.}
<A>__{christof has taken his place at the control panel. on the bank of monitors in front of the mixing desk, the operators systematically search through the numerous set ups in truman's home and neighborhood. occasionally marlon or an extra appear in frame as they fan out and begin a man hunt. while the on air monitor continues to play its test card, christof and simeon concentrate on another isolated monitor playing in fast rewind, time code in the bottom right corner. it is a recording of the night's transmission. simeon stops on the last on camera appearance by truman. they watch truman, on screen, switch off his bedroom light and climb into bed fully clothed, immediately pulling the covers over his head. as the light is switched off, the recording camera automatically switches to night vision. simeon continues to play at normal speed, now and then scrolling forward in fast forward mode. christof suddenly points to the screen.}

<A>__{on the blown up screen, between a cardboard box and a chair leg, it is barely possible to make out truman's hand as he crawls commando style from his bedroom, his inflatable replacement already positioned in the bed.}

<D>__{how does he know where the cameras are?}

<D>__{i don't know.}
<P>__{(noting the time code on the monitor, staring into the back of simeon's head)}
<D>__{all i know is we've been filming a blow up doll for the last three hours.}
<A>__{simeon feels the hostility.}
