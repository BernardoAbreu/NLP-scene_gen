<L>__{interior the grim house day}
<A>__{that evening. fay comes downstairs in only a towel and wet hair. she switches on the tv and looks for cigarettes. she finds mary's pills on the table and remembers to ask...}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{ma, you take your medication?}
<A>__{mary is lying on the couch. she drags her eyes from the tv and glances lazily at fay, then back to the tv.}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{guess so.}
<A>__{she sits at the kitchen table and lifts her magazine. henry shows up at the kitchen door with a pile of library books. his eyes brighten when he sees... fay sitting there wearing only her towel. he knocks. she looks back over her shoulder and sees him.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{evening, fay.}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(disdainfully)}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i've got these books for simon.}
<A>__{she turns away.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{well, leave 'em there on the counter, then.}
<A>__{he comes in and stacks the books near the sink. fay pretends to ignore him, but rakes her fingers through her wet hair anyway, to show more shoulder. this is not lost on henry, who tarries and leans back against the counter, salivating. fay flips through her magazine and henry steps closer and leans against the fridge. she casts a bored glance in his direction, then returns her attention to the tv. she senses him step aside and follows his movements without turning. suddenly his hand appears from behind her and gently strokes her hair. she freezes, waits, wonders... he leans his face down beside her. she looks at him. he looks at her, then down to... her bare legs crossed before her on the kitchen chair. his hand moves down and slides itself deep in between her things. her mouth drops open. he looks back up at her. he grins. fay jumps up and away, breathlessly clutching the towel around herself. henry casts a glance over her body, throws his hair back out of his face and shivers with lust. fay steps back and grabs hold of the staircase banister, making an unconvincing gesture of injured pride. henry comes closer and she steps backwards up the stairs. he stops, loosens his tie, holding her with his gaze. she readjusts her towel, throws back her wet hair, sighs defiantly, then sashays into her room, leaving the door ajar. henry waits there at the foot of the stairs, reaches down, grabs his crotch and repositions his hard on. he takes a step up the stairs, then stops. he looks over to the couch and sees... mary, lying there, sedately amazed. he pauses, then grins. mary blinks and smiles sleepily.}
