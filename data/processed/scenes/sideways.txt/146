<D>__{evelyn berman silverman's office.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hi, it's miles.}
<C>__{assistant }
<D>__{oh, hi, miles. let me see if i can get her.}
<P>__{(a moment later)}
<D>__{you're in luck. i will put you through.}
<C>__{evelyn }
<D>__{miles.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hey, evelyn, it's your favorite client.}
<C>__{evelyn }
<D>__{how's the trip?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{good, good. drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. so what's happening? still no word?}
<C>__{evelyn }
<D>__{actually there is word. i spoke to keith kurtzman this morning.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{evelyn }
<D>__{and... they're passing. conundrum's passing. he said they really liked it. they really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. he said it was a tough call.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{evelyn }
<D>__{i'm sorry, miles.}
<P>__{(off his silence)}
<D>__{so i don't know where that leaves us. i'm not sure how much more mileage i can get out of continuing to submit it. i think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now a fabulous book with no home. the whole industry's gotten gutless. it's not about the quality of the books. it's about the marketing.}
<A>__{miles is at a loss for words. a distant rumble begins to sound, the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack.}
