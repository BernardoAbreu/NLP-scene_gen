<L>__{int holden's bedroom night}
<A>__{holden and alyssa lie in each other's arms, moonlight bathing them. she smokes.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{can i ask you something?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{don't even tell me you want to do it again.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{why me you know? why now?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{because you were giving me that look, and i got wet...}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you know what i'm talking about.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{why not you?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i'm a guy. you're attracted to girls.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i see you've been taking notes. historically, yes that's true.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{then why this?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i've given that a lot of thought, you know? i mean, now that i'm being ostracized by my friends, i've had a lot of time to think about all of this. and what i've come up with is really simple: i came to this on my terms. i didn't just heed what i was taught, you know? men and women should be together, it's the natural way that kind of thing. i'm not with you because of what family, society, life tried to instill in me from day one. the way the world is how seldom you meet that one person who gets you... it's so rare. my parents didn't really have it. there was no example set for me in the world of male female relation ships. and to cut oneself off from finding that person to immediately half your options by eliminating the possibility of finding that one person within your own gender... that just seemed stupid. so i didn't. and by leaving my options open, i was branded 'gay', which to me was no big deal labels are labels, you know? they define what you do, not who you are, i guess. but then you come along. you the one least likely; i mean, you were a guy.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{still am.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{and while i was falling for you, i put a ceiling on that, because you were a guy. until i remembered why i opened the door to women in the first place to not limit the likelihood of finding that one person who'd compliment me so completely. and so here we are, i was thorough when i looked for you, and i feel justified lying in your arms because i got here on my terms, and have no question that there was someplace i didn't look. and that makes all the difference.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{well, you took the luster our of it.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{what luster?}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(joking in case you didn't get it)}
<D>__{of how i brought you back from the other side. how all you needed was the right man to turn you around.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{you're not the right man.}
<P>__{(kisses him)}
<D>__{you're just the one.}
<A>__{she snuggles into him and closes her eyes. holden stares at the ceiling.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{can i at least cell people that all you needed was some serious deep dicking?}
<A>__{she hits him with her pillow. the big ol' falling in love montage begins}
