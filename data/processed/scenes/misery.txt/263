<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{study. night.}
<A>__{paul is sitting at a table that annie has set up with her best china and silverware. it is as romantic as annie wilkes gets. annie enters, carrying a basket of rolls. she sits and serves paul.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i hope you like it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it looks wonderful. and so do you.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh...}
<A>__{they eat in awkward silence. finally:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{my secret is i only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. and to give it that little extra zip, i mix in some spam with the ground beef.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you can't get this in a restaurant in new york.}
<A>__{after another pause:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{annie, i think we should have a toast.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{a toast?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes, to misery. let me pour you some more wine.}
<A>__{paul pours more of the gallo wine, then raises his glass.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{to misery.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{wait, let's do this right. do you have any candles?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, i don't know. i think so. i will go look.}
<A>__{she exits into the kitchen. paul quickly pulls the packet filled with novril powder from his pants. he empties it into her glass of wine, stuffs the empty packet back into his pants, talking the whole time:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, you. i just picked things up over the years.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, it certainly says you.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you really think so?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{absolutely. listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. i just thought it might be nice.}
<A>__{annie re enters with a candle.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{are you kidding? if anyone ever told me that one day i'd be having a candlelit dinner with paul sheldon in my own house, i woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. will this do?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's perfect.}
<A>__{she places the candle on the table. with a slight tremor in her hand, she lights the candle. paul raises his glass.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{to misery and annie wilkes, who brought her back to life.}
<A>__{annie raises her glass.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, paul, every time i think about it, i get goosebumps.}
<A>__{they clink glasses. and with that, her emotions having gotten the best of her, she knocks over the candle. in trying to right the situation, she places her glass back down, and as she reaches for the candle, she knocks over her glass, spilling the wine.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(wiping up the spilled wine with her napkin)}
<D>__{oh, god, what have i done? i'm so sorry, paul. i ruined your beautiful toast. will you ever forgive me? here, let me pour another one.}
<P>__{(she does)}
<D>__{can we pretend this never happened? to misery?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{to misery.}
<A>__{so they drink their wine.}
