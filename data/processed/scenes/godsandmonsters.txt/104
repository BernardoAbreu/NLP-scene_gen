<A>__{we race along the open trench with whale, the darkened sky intermittently punctured by bursts of gunfire. he reaches the periscope, pulls an enlisted man off it. from his pov, we see barnett and mcgill dodging bullets as they attempt to make their way back.}

<P>__{(through clenched teeth)}
<D>__{come on. come on.}
<A>__{mcgill leaps over the barbed wire of a forward trench. barnett follows. just as his feet leave the ground his chest is riddled by a fresh round of gunfire. whale's eyes snap closed, trying to obliterate what they've just seen.}
<C>__{whale }
<D>__{barnett's body fell in wire as thick as briers. it was hanging there the next morning, a hundred yards from the line, too far out for anyone to fetch it.}
