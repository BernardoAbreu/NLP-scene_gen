<L>__{interior bungalow #86 morning}
<A>__{the bungalow was originally designed for lab science: glass encased cupboards, a caged white lab rat on a side counter, an 8' by 3' counter top (island) at the front of the room, including a built in sink and butane gas valve. students crowd the opened windows on the far side of the room. the chaotic atmosphere centers around one student... benny chacon (18), the tagger we met earlier. trevor's back to square one. he struggles with trepidation as he steps into the doorway of the bungalow and hesitates. a young black girl, lakesia stewart (16), stands near the doorway. she cradles a realistic looking e.n.a.b.l. baby (education now and babies later).}

<D>__{it's not real. we're studying teen parenting in home ec.' it's computerized, so it cries and shit.}
<A>__{crowd at the windows begins to disperse now, finding their seats, except for benny who doesn't budge. trevor approaches, gazes out the window, eyes sizing up the situation.}
