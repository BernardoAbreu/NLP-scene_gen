<A>__{the croc as he slowly starts to move. the teenagers start to take turns, swinging on a rope from a branch which overhangs the shoreline. as they laugh and yell, danny swings on a long rope... landing with a splash. about ten feet from the croc, waiting stealth like, his eyes barely above surface. he could easily go for danny... but he somehow knows the service will get better. as danny swims back to shore, janine takes hold of the rope.}
