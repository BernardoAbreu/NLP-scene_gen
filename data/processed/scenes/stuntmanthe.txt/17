<A>__{as cameron flies down the back steps, a cop stationed at the rear door, caught off guard, tries to stop him but is shoved flat on his back. cameron weaves and scrambles across the yard, over fences, between the shed and the barn, rolling beneath a building, out the other side. behind him, distant shouts and a gunshot.}

<A>__{as cameron runs, he moves with a skill that suggests forests are not alien to him. he crouches low, following tiny avenues in the maze of tree trunks, scrambling on all fours over needles and fallen cones. sweat pours down his face. his breath rasps in his throat. he breaks into a clearing and freezes...suddenly face to face with a man who crouches, blocking his path. it is one of the telephone linemen we saw earlier.}
