<L>__{interior prison cell day}
<A>__{rudy lies in his bunk, staring at the same paper snowflakes.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{hey, hey, listen here. "i've made my list and i've checked it twice, and as long as you're naughty, it's gonna be nice. these cold winter weeks have been killing me, nick, as i lie here alone. it's not enough to have your warmth in my heart anymore; i need your warmth next to me. work at penney's has been busy because it's christmas and that's when we do almost half of our business for the whole year ", okay, whatever, whatever }
<P>__{(skipping on)}
<D>__{" my manager's still mad at me for asking for the whole week off," whatever, whatever }
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{here we go. "and all that gets me through the day is to close my eyes and imagine holding you, and kissing you, and touching you, and tasting you everywhere because i know at that moment, i will feel i've found the reason for my whole entire life."}
<A>__{rudy still stares at the stone ceiling.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{for twenty five, she sounds pretty mature.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah. you grow up in detroit, you get matured real quick.}
<A>__{nick's doing pushups on the floor below, smoking a cig, reading sheets of pink stationery. with a new photo: of the same girl, in a bikini by a lake. vamping a childish pose.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sure as hell don't make me miss millie bobek. guess i owe millie, though. if i hadn't been rollin, her, i woulda never ended up here. and i woulda never met ashley.}
<P>__{(studies photo)}
<D>__{that's the world for ya.}
<A>__{nick climbs off the floor, paces back to the bunks, marvelling at the latest letter.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{what if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. you just don't do it for her.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{me and her got a connection.}
<P>__{(hands page to him)}
<D>__{read this part. read the part about stuffing her stocking.}
<A>__{nick drops the page on his stomach. rudy sighs, picks it up, brings it to his nose.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{she's using a new perfume.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no, i think that's just oranges. she writes here she's eating oranges.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{shoulda written to that magazine, rudy. i'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. not some one nighter, man... a relationship. you? you're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{mornin', gorgeous. more egg nog?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{shoulda written, rudy...}
<A>__{nick drops back to his bunk, pasting the new lakeside photo among his collage of pictures. admiring his pen pal:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{shoulda got yourself a girl.}
<A>__{above, rudy peruses the page nick gave him. some lipstick marks pressed to the paper. he passes it back, closes his eyes.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{all i want... is to make it to sidnaw, and sit down for christmas dinner. watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{thought you hated sidnaw.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{just taste that christmas turkey.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{thought you hate your old man.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{five years, nicky. five years.}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i just want to go home.}
<A>__{there's the echo of crashing metal gates. prisoners yelling. nick smiles, still staring at his girl.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{well, man. me and ashley. we'll be thinking about you.}
