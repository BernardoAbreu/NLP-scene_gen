<L>__{interior jack's room night}
<A>__{tins of fruit drops: three kinds: black cherry, pineapple and lemon. each tin is emptied of its fruit drops. twenty rounds of ammunition each round packed in silica fit exactly into each tin. lead rounds in the black cherry, jacketed in the pineapple and explosive in the lemon. jack re seals each tin with sellotape.}
<L>__{exterior l'aquila, corso frederico ii day}
<A>__{the colonnades of this popular pedestrain street are crowded with window shoppers, tourists taking coffee, old men discussing politics and office girls walking hand in hand and chattering like songbirds. jack is in dark glasses. he's sitting in a coffee shop under the colonnade sucking a fruit drop and reading a copy of il messagiero. c.u. we see he's studying a small column concerning the murder of two prostitutes in the nearby city of chieti. jack spots clara walking along the corso. she's with a girl he has not seen before. anna. anna is small town girl with a keen sense of fashion. she and clara are hand in hand. clara sees jack and speaks to her friend. they cross through the throng of boulevardiers.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{my friend anna. this is my friend signor farfalla.}
<A>__{clara's eyes twinkle mischievously. the girls cease to hold hands and anna offers hers to jack. jack half rises like the perfect gentlemen, folding his newspaper and accepting anna's greeting.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how do you do?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i am very well thank you.}
<A>__{ah. this is to be an impromptu english lesson. jack acquiesces gracefully.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{will you take a coffee with me?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{that would be very good.}
<A>__{he indicates two empty chairs.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{prego.}
<A>__{clara moves her chair to sit closer to jack. under the table, her knee presses against his. anna also moves her chair nearer to jack: but her motive is to move it out of the sun. she is not flirting.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{anna is learning english.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{have you been to england?}
<A>__{anna seems momentarily confused.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{but you are...}
<A>__{she looks at clara.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{lui americano?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i am.}
<A>__{jack glances at clara. how much has she told her friend?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ah. i have not been to england only to france. but i would love to go to america.}
<A>__{the waiter comes over.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{due cappuccini e un cafe corretto.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{anna is like all italians. she thinks america is like in the movies. little italy, "west side story", "chicago".}
<C>__{clara }
<D>__{i tell her in these times america is like here, there, anywhere. the streets are not... pave ed with gold.}
<A>__{she beams happily at jack. he smiles back at her.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{if not with gold, than at least not with enough medieval cobbles to loosen every self tapping screw in a fiat.}
<A>__{jack beams. neither girl understands. but everyone smiles happily. the waiter brings the coffee and clara insists on paying.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{where do you come from, anna?}
<A>__{anna frowns. jack plays teacher.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{dove abita?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ah, yes! i live in via dell' argilla. nearby to clara.}
<A>__{jack briefly wonders what else he could teach her. he scans both girls and decides clara is the prettier. clara seems to sense this. she smiles to herself. jack is touched.}
