<A>__{the same decrepit two storey place maurice et al hit earlier. now it's a crime scene. a small crowd of neighbourhood gawkers stand just behind the yellow tape. a huge spotlight lights up the front yard. karen pulls up in her rental car, gets out and badges the visibly freezing cop at the tape, working crowd control.}

<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{with everybody else.}
<A>__{karen ducks under the tape and starts up the walk. she pauses to watch as two coroner's assistants cover with a sheet a dead black woman who lies just below a broken upstairs window.}
