<A>__{the bishop from the waist up, sitting behind his beautiful desk. compassionately:}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{it's a question of continuing values. st. catherine's to do the good that she must do in the community has to maintain the position that she holds in the community. so we have a question of balance. on the one hand, the reputation, and, so, the effectiveness of our hospital, and two of her important doctors and, on the other hand, the rights of your client.}

<D>__{a young woman. in her prime... deprived of...}
<P>__{(searches for a word)}
<D>__{...life... sight... her family... it's tragic. it's a tragic accident.}
<A>__{galvin has been dreaming.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{...nothing, of course, can begin to make it right. but we must do what we can. we must do all that we can.}
<A>__{he gestures to the young priest, who crosses the room, extracts a sheet from a file folder, and places it before galvin, who is sitting as if in a dream. the bishop waits a beat, not wanting to interrupt galvin's reverie, then catches his eye and gestures down at the paper. galvin glances down.}

<A>__{the sheet: "i, frank p. galvin, duly appointed conservator for deborah ann kaye, in consideration of two hundred ten thousand dollars ($210,000.00) paid in hand to me this day by st. catherine laboure hospital do hereby release from any and all claims..."}

<A>__{galvin and the bishop as before. galvin finishes reading, looks up.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{yes. we must try to make it right.}

<D>__{it's a generous offer, mr. galvin...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{how did you settle on the amount?}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{we thought it was just.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{you thought it was just.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. two hundred ten thousand. that would mean i keep seventy.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{that was our insurance company's recommendation.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{yes. it would be.}
<A>__{a beat.}

<D>__{nothing that we can do can make that woman well.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{and no one will know the truth.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{what is the truth?}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{that that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. she has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends and the people who should care for her: her doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. we have been paid to look the other way. i came in here to take your money.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i brought snapshots to show you. so i could get your money.}
<P>__{(to young priest, waving away document)}
