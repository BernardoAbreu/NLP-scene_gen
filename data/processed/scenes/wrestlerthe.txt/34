<A>__{randy smashing kid loco in the face with a flying drop kick. kid loco falls to the canvas. randy struts around the ring, exhorting the crowd, soaking up their cheers. distracted, randy doesn't notice kid loco peeling himself off the mat. kid loco sneaks up behind randy and smashes him in the head. randy goes down. kid loco lifts randy up. they're both on their knees, chest to chest. kid loco steps to his feet, lifting randy with him. kid loco tightens around randy's arms, arches his back, presses out his chest and... wham!! he and randy fly with a lateral drop. randy's head hits the canvas hard as he slams down on his back. as randy writhes on the mat, kid loco heads for the}

<A>__{randy's pov: kid loco is untying the turnbuckle's padded cover. randy, clutching his back, discretely reaches into the waistband of his tights and pulls out a razor blade. he tucks the blade between two fingers in his cupped palm. kid loco heads back to randy. he picks up him by the hair and drags him to the turnbuckle, throwing him head first into the exposed metal post beneath. randy, clutching his smashed head, discretely runs the blade along his hairline. no one sees it happen. blood streams down randy's forehead. the crowd's electrified. kid loco slams randy's head into the metal post again. again. randy slumps over the corner ropes. kid loco cockily struts around the ring.}

<D>__{look at this loser! how pathetic.}
<A>__{angle on randy. the taunting stirs something in him. a look comes over him, like he's bruce banner about to become the hulk. kid loco saunters back over to randy. he grabs his head for another post smash, but he can't. randy's neck and arm muscles bulge. his neck veins pop like he's suddenly super charged. a look of fear comes over kid loco. he knows the tide is about to turn. randy reaches over his shoulder and grabs kid loco by the hair. he pulls him in close.}

<D>__{let's go home.}
<A>__{randy juts his hips back and bends over, gaining the leverage he needs for a throw. kid loco shakes his head, begging no. randy straightens his legs, raises his lower back, and yanks down on kid loco's head. kid loco's feet fly off the canvas as his head gets buried into the mat. he gets stuck upside down with his feet over the ropes. randy, holding onto the top rope with both hands, thrusts his knee into kid loco's stomach. again. again. kid loco somehow manages to untangle himself from the ropes. he scurries away. randy goes after him. randy hits kid loco with everything he's got. dropkicks. elbows. bodyslams. he pours it on, unstoppable. randy drags kid loco into the middle of the ring. he looks out at the crowd. randy's pov: a trio of fans are chanting.}

<A>__{randy "mulls" it over. he looks at his laid out foe. he looks at the corner. he heads for the corner. randy climbs to the top rope. he looks around at the crowd like he's still undecided. randy's pov: the fans are cheering, wild with anticipation. randy bends his arms, pressing them against the side of his head like ram's horns. (just like in the photo in the opening montage.) he leaps. the leap is not terribly high or graceful. he crashes down onto kid loco horns first. kid loco's whole body convulses. the fans lose it. this is what they wanted. the ram jam. the money shot.}
