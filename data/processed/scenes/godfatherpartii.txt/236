<A>__{connie corleone, dressed simply and now showing her age without the carefully applied makeup which we have been used to, kneels down before the shrine of santa theresa, and puts down a bouquet of flowers, along with others that have been placed there. we see that some have the simple silk ribbon with the word "mama" hand lettered upon it. her two children stand close behind her; they had been raised by their grandmother. connie steps back, and moves through the small group of friends and relatives, into michael's house.}
