<A>__{in the fishbowl of his glass office, colin is being stared at by pissed off cops. colin calms down. he opens the gray envelope. he takes out the forms that he was given by costello, opens up police personnel database and starts searching. he types in ss numbers. one, then another, then another. the result is always: "person not found". he types in costigan, william m, hits return. it comes up: "person not found". colin keeps working.}
