<L>__{exterior ridgeside road night}
<A>__{a winding two lane road, overlooking a small ravine at a grassy overlook. the road is dusted with snow; there's been no traffic here for awhile. the motor city monster steams to a stop beyond the overlook. then starts backing up, such that the gate of the trailer is fifteen feet from the edge of the ridge. a hundred foot drop into the ravine below. gabriel and ashley pile out of the cab. they lift the trailer gate, extend the tire ramps. the ramps run from the trailer to five feet away from, the ravine drop.}
<B>__{in the cab}
<A>__{gabriel pulls rudy out of the sleeper. marches him back to the ravine's edge and gives him a look. forces him to his knees. ashley is in the truck trailer, splashing the inside of the nova with a can of gasoline.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you almost got away with it, santa. got outta the tomahawk, got to your car, got halfway to canada till you caught some ice in the road. by the time you hit bottom down there, whole car was burning like a comet. musta burned up all that money too.}
<A>__{rudy glances to the trailer. ashley tosses a couple handfuls of bills into the car.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. started shooting. they won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. four dead santas and some burned up cash. merry christmas, the end.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{was it your plan, monster? or was it hers.}
<A>__{gabriel smiles at him.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{she told me 'bout the convict magazines. had to figure there'd be some boys in the pen with some useful knowledge. with nobody to talk to. nobody to listen. so we stocked up on stationery.}
<A>__{ashley hops down. gabriel puts an arm around her.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{hard life being a trucker's girl.}
<A>__{rudy eyes ashley. she stares darkly back.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i saved your life.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{you shouldn't have.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{he did love you, you know. nick. he did love you.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{who wouldn't.}
<A>__{so cold. but rudy doesn't pause.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{maybe this is where you wanted him, ashley. at the bottom of a ravine, dead as ice with a burnt up heart. maybe. but it didn't happen. 'cause what you did for him was make him the happiest held ever been. you showed him hope and taught him mercy. and he died a peaceful man. you wanted to destroy some convict... and all you did was save his soul. remember that. love your money and remember that.}
<A>__{ashley shivers, a touch shaken. but steels herself:}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{merry christmas, rudy.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i'm glad it was me.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{merry christmas.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{get in the car.}
<A>__{gabriel hauls him up. marches him to the trailer. rudy stops at the ramp. gabriel pushes. rudy doesn't move.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{get in the car!}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{how'd you know my name...}
<A>__{he turns back to ashley.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{rudy. how'd you know my name?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{rudy looks at gabriel. he's frowning. to ashley:}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you said merry christmas, rudy.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i... you told me your name was rudy. you told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't nick }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{you were screaming you weren't nick! and we just didn't fucking believe you!}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{but i never said rudy.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{you said it a million times!}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i never told you my name.}
<A>__{he stares her down. then stares at gabriel.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{ash?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{how'd you know my name was rudy.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{ash?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{how'd you know my name.}
<A>__{ashley stares daggers. shakes her head ruefully }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{men.}
<A>__{ and pulls a handgun, shooting gabriel in the heart. gabriel falls to his knees in the snow, his mouth a ring of shock. blood spurts through his red coat. he stares at ashley, incredulous. she steps forward and puts another bullet in his neck. gabriel falls still. ashley's breath frosts in the cold. rudy watches her. finally, she meets rudy's eyes. they stare each other down for a long moment, before:}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{where is he.}
<A>__{a silence. no one moves. and finally, the crunch of footsteps from around the side of the trailer. and whistling. "silver bells." a shadow moves across the snow behind the trailer, and soon steps into rudy and ashley's view. it's nick mason. alive and well.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{merry christmas, rudy.}
<A>__{ashley smiles. her muscles and mustache man pen pal is here.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i missed you, beautiful.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i missed you too, nicky baby.}
<A>__{they share a passionate kiss. ashley malts at the sight of him, embracing happily. then turns to rudy:}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{for your information. i never fuck the wrong guy.}
<A>__{rudy just stands there, his mind playing catch up.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh, hey. have you two been properly introduced? sweetness, this is rudy duncan, i did almost a year with him in the mountain. read him all your letters, talked about you all the time, made him feel like he really knew you.}
<P>__{(turns to rudy)}
<D>__{my friend... wantcha to meet millie bobek. 'member millie bobek, dontcha? my girlfriend fore i went in? worked at that bar in motor city, where i manslaughtered that guy? hell. didn't talk about her much once the ashley letters started coming, i guess.}
<A>__{rudy doesn't notice it's started to snow.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. i was in the mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{she set them up. all of them.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{why not have her pretend to find me? pretend to write me and reel me in? tell her new trucker man she'd pose as some sister of his named ashley?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{and you set me up.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{always wanted to rob that casino, rudy. way back when i worked there. what better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.}
<A>__{nick shrugs. prods rudy up the ramp. into the trailer:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{paid the alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. he's a lifer, what does he care. paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story i was dead. once the wound healed up...}
<P>__{(notes cash sacks)}
<D>__{got out of the mountain this morning. and tonight i'm a rich man.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{how'd you know i'd do it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{do what?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{walk outta there and tell her i was you.}
<A>__{nick looks back at ashley.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{because every time i read her letters, rudy... you listened.}
<P>__{(to ashley)}
<D>__{keep your gun on him.}
<A>__{nick forces rudy inside, unties the belt from his wrists and lashes them to the bottom of the steering wheel.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{five santas walked into that tomahawk, rudy. that's what the witnesses'll say. so we gotta have five santas not walk out. gotta have five...}
<P>__{(working)}
<D>__{this'll burn right away... in the fire...}
<A>__{nick gets rudy's wrists locked to the wheel. he laughs.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hell, you never needed to convince ashley you were me. just the dumb fucking truckers. i figured i'd talked enough about the tomahawk in the pen for you to get by }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot i'd remember}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hm. well. they'd have killed you if you weren't me, rudy. we knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.}
<A>__{nick slams the car door, locking rudy in.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{they had the weapons and the willpower. we just gave them their inside man.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you gave them me.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i gave them me.}
<P>__{(shrugs, smiles)}
<D>__{said some nice things about me, rudy. i appreciate it. but don't worry. i do love her. and she loves me. you had that right all along.}
<A>__{nick reaches across him, releases the brake. puts the car into "drive." turns to ashley:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sweetness! let's light up the tree!}
<A>__{ashley steps toward the ramp, taking out a matchbook. nick steps further into the trailer, to the back of the nova.}
<B>__{in the car}
<A>__{rudy immediately wriggles his hands, trying to touch his wrists together. trying to press together the white cuffs of his santa suit. trying to get the right pressure point as a blade suddenly springs out of the cuff! the switchblade he'd stolen from the blazer it's lashed to his right wrist! rudy starts sawing his wrist back and forth, cutting through the santa belt his hands at the bottom of the wheel, too low for either ashley or nick to see }
<B>__{in the trailer}
<A>__{ashley is at the hood of the car, lighting her match. nick is at the back bumper, ready to push it down the ramp }
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{goodbye, rudy! nice spending time with you!}
<B>__{in the car}
<A>__{the belt breaks! rudy snaps his hands free! but instead of trying to escape, he reaches under the steering column, ripping its panel away and pulling wires free! as ashley tosses her match onto the hood, and fire races over the body of the car, tongues racing inside, over the dash, over the seats, lapping at rudy who ducks his head beneath the wheel, frantic to locate the right leads }
<B>__{in the trailer}
<A>__{ashley jumps out of the way, to the snow. nick pushes the flaming car to the trailer's edge starting on down the ramp, the ravine ahead and as gravity starts to take the metal bonfire }
<B>__{in the car}
<A>__{rudy sparks two wires together, flames eating at him }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{like riding a bike, like riding a bike, like riding a biiiiike!}
<A>__{ and the engine ignites! rudy slams the gearshift into "reverse", grabs the wheel and looks over his shoulder at shocked nick behind him }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{rule one! never put a car thief behind the wheel!}
<A>__{ and slams the accelerator.}
<B>__{on full scene}
<A>__{as the burning nova races backwards up the ramp, and back into the trailer terrified nick turns to run but there's nowhere to go and the car slams into the trailer's back, crushing nick's legs between metal and metal!}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{nooooooo!!!}
<A>__{then rudy faces front, pounds the shift into "drive."}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{rule two!}
<A>__{ashley stands at the bottom of the ramp, vengeance and rage. she grabs her handgun, opens fire and rudy slams the gas again, shooting down the ramp as he flings open the car door, dives and rolls while the burning nova collides with ashley, throwing her onto the hood, and sending the tandem inferno speeding off the ridgetop arcing slowly as it plummets into the ravine, a smoking, blazing shooting star with a woman's figure hanging on. the shooting star hits earth and explodes.}
