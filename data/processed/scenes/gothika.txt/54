<T>__{fade out: fade in:}
<L>__{exterior woodward institute garden day}
<A>__{sprinkler systems doing their thing: thwip, thwip, thwip... the female patients are out in the gardens for their freshly dose of air. boom down to miranda alone at a bench. a cigarette appears before her, being offered to her:}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{you a marlboro girl?}
<A>__{miranda sees jenna looming above her, shielding the sun.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i don't smoke, thanks.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{all we have is our health, cupcake.}
<P>__{(sits beside her)}
<D>__{what i do is quit constantly, start again. drives them all crazy. one day i quit three times.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{huh.}
<A>__{jenna lights her smoke, blows out the match slowly. miranda turns and checks the building entrance as jenna rambles on.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{they allow me one match at a time and pretend they're not watching. check it out: salivating goon number one at three o'clock, oh so inconspicuous goon number two at five o'clock.}
<A>__{miranda follows jenna's gaze. sure enough, she's being closely watched by two orderlies.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what did you set on fire to wind up here?}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{very perceptive, doc. i burnt down the building where i worked. i found a baby at the doorstep, called the cops of course the bottom feeding pricks never showed. it's beside the point, really.}
<A>__{miranda shrugs. god knows what jenna is talking about but who is she to say? once again, miranda checks the building entrance and now sees parsons emerge. she rises }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{phil.}
<A>__{he keeps walking. headed to the parking lot beyond.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{phil!}
<A>__{he turns. his first instinct is to smile. but he checks himself, reminding himself of her new status. slips into his best professional face:}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{hello, miranda.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i wonder if i could talk to you.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{of course.}
<P>__{(checks his watch)}
<D>__{well, actually, i'm about to...}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{your staff meeting's done and thursdays you don't schedule sessions until the afternoon. this will just take one minute. promise.}
<A>__{impressive. she remembers his schedule perfectly.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{true.}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{but the sheriff wants to ask me some questions.}
<A>__{she follows his look to the parking lot where sheriff ryan emerges from his patrol car. miranda nods.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{it's about pete.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{what about him?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{perhaps he's not the most qualified person to be treating me.}
<A>__{his tone is fatherly yet direct.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{are you complaining about his methods or are you referring to the nature of your past relationship with him?}
<A>__{this surprises her.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what did he tell you?}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{he explained there might be a conflict of interest because he has feelings for you. you two engaged in a kiss at one pointerior am i right?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{i told him we're all grownups here and the fact is he's the best doctor on my staff. as such, and given the severity of the charges you face, i consider him the most qualified person to assist your recovery. now, if you'll excuse me, sheriff ryan is not a patient man.}
<A>__{stonewalled in the simplest of ways, she's left feeling like an idiot. watches parsons join the sheriff by his car. the two men shake hands when suddenly irene runs past her, yelling }
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{hey! chloe!}
<A>__{now two orderlies race past. miranda looks over to see what the fuss is all about. chloe is on top of an institute staff member we haven't seen before, a round black woman named consuelo. punching her other patients have crowded around the scuffle.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{you fucking cow giving me the evil eye, huh? fuck you, you fuckin' voodoo witch !}
<A>__{irene and the orderlies yank chloe off consuelo. chloe kicks and screams like an animal. consuelo meekly stands up.}
<C>__{consuelo}
<P>__{(heavy cuban accent)}
<D>__{is okay, she's okay she don't mean nothing.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{you bet your goddamn fat ass i mean it, you're a witch !!}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{mcgrath, that's enough!}
<A>__{the orderlies start pulling chloe away. chloe spits at consuelo, full of venom.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{take your voodoo shit back to cuba }
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{i said that's enough.}
<C>__{consuelo}
<D>__{irene, she's okay. pobrecita, la infeliz. it's a misunderstanding. pobrecita. i was only trying to help her }
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{you wanna help me? you pity me?}
<P>__{(grabbing her crotch)}
<D>__{suck me.}
<A>__{the orderlies haul chloe off. irene disperses the crowd. consuelo sighs, embarrassed, wipes a bloody lip. her manner says she just wants to get back to her duties. excitement over, the patients resume whatever it is they were doing. miranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something catches her eye: pete watching her from his office window. he quickly slides the curtain shut. odd.}
