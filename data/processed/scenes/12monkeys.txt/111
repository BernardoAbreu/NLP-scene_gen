<L>__{interior police station office morning}
<A>__{railly is being "debriefed" by police officers and fbi agents.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{then i said something to him about cooperating and he said he would do that, so i got in the car and started honking the horn. when i got out, he was gone.}
<C>__{lieutenant halperin}
<D>__{you lucked out. for a while we thought you were a body they found down state... mutilated.}
<A>__{a cop enters, hands a photo to lieutenant halperin who studies it.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{he wouldn't do something like that he...}
<C>__{lieutenant ralperin}
<P>__{(interrupts, hands her the photo)}
<D>__{this the man he attacked?}
<A>__{railly looks at the photo, an 8 x 10 of the first thug, slumped against the alley wall, obviously dead.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{i'd like to be clear about this. that man and the other one were..."severely" beating us. james cole didn't start it. in fact he saved me!}
<C>__{lieutenant ralperin}
<D>__{funny thing, doctor, maybe you can explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist why do kidnap victims almost always try to tell us about the guys who grabbed 'em and try to make us understand how kind these bastards really were?}
<C>__{railly}
<P>__{(as if reciting)}
<D>__{it's a normal reaction to a life threatening situation.}
<P>__{(suddenly animated)}
<D>__{he's sick. he thinks he comes from the future. he's been living in a carefully constructed fantasy world and that world is starting to disintegrate. he needs help!}
