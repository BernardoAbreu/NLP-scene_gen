<L>__{interior brothel. night.}

<C>__{latika}
<D>__{jamal?}
<A>__{the dance teacher turns.}
<C>__{dance teacher}

<A>__{but latika remains fixed.}
<C>__{dance teacher}
<D>__{you silly little boys. get out now while you can.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{come with us.}
<A>__{latika runs to jamal. but she freezes as she looks at the doorway. maman, punnoose and the woman from downstairs stand there. the skin around punnoose's eye bears the blisters from the chloroform burn years ago.}
<C>__{maman}
<D>__{look who we have here, punnoose. hello again, jamal. salim. never forget a face. especially one that i own.}
<C>__{punnoose}
<D>__{shall i take them to the marshes?}
<C>__{maman}
<D>__{whatever you like. have fun. just make sure that you dispose of them properly afterwards. no traces, thank you.}
<A>__{he turns to jamal.}
<C>__{maman }
<D>__{you really thought you could just walk in and take my prize away? have you any idea how much this little virgin is worth, bhen chod?}
<A>__{he fingers latika's hair.}
<C>__{maman }
<D>__{get them out of here.}
<A>__{punnoose and the muscle walk towards jamal. maman turns to the dance teacher as they grab his arms.}
<C>__{maman }
<D>__{please continue, master ji.}
<A>__{the dance teacher puts the music back on.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{suddenly, salim is holding a pistol.}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{leave him. get over there.}
<A>__{punnoose and the muscle slowly release jamal and join maman.}
<C>__{maman}
<D>__{let's not be foolish, salim. heavy, aren't they?}
<A>__{salim straightens up his gun arm.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{money.}
<C>__{maman}
<D>__{you can have money. here.}
<A>__{maman gets out his wallet and throws all the money in it on the floor.}
<C>__{maman }
<D>__{take it. go. disappear with your friend and we'll forget all about this. okay?}
<A>__{salim collects up the money.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{maman never forgets. isn't that right?}
<C>__{maman}
<D>__{oh, maman can make an exception.}
<A>__{salim walks over to the music, turns it up. picks up a cushion from the bed and walks right up to maman.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{can't take that risk, maman. sorry.}
<A>__{he wraps the cushion around the gun and pulls the trigger. or tries to. nothing happens. there is a frozen moment as they watch him fail to shoot. everybody watches with surreal interest as salim fumbles with the pistol. eventually he looks up, giggles stupidly.}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{safety catch.}
<A>__{shrugs apologetically and shoots. nobody is more surprised than maman who crumples onto the floor. latika starts desperately gathering up the notes on the floor, grabs maman's wallet. jamal just stands.}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{they run out of the room and down the stairs as maman dies on the floor in front of his frozen colleagues.}
