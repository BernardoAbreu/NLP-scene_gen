<ACTION>__{A small kid, TJ FORNEY (13), with a grubby worn cast on his arm, rides his BMX really fast down a street. He chases a tow truck towing a badly wrecked red Volvo. He struggles to keep up. The truck makes a turn. TJ follows, turning dangerously in front of oncoming traffic. The truck makes another turn. TJ turns with it, running straight into the side of a car pulling out of a driveway. He comes off his bike and is thrown across the hood. He picks himself up, stunned. The driver of the car gets out to see if he's hurt. TJ looks down the street to see the tow truck disappearing in the distance. He hurries back to his bike. He jumps on and continues after the truck. TJ gives chase. He gains on the truck. He can see it pull into a used car lot ahead - FAIR OAKS CAR CITY.}

<LOC>__{EXT. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - MOMENTS LATER}
<ACTION>__{TJ rides his bike through an eerily barren unfinished housing development - half-built houses and perfectly sealed wide streets. Up ahead, he can see a small section of unfinished road - a big patch of dirt and rocks. He veers up a driveway to avoid it. He passes the dirt patch and then comes down off the curb back onto the road, trying to keep control of his bike. He hits the road and loses his balance. The handlebars twist and he crashes onto the road. He jumps up and yelps in pain, clutching his elbow. He looks at it. It's badly grazed. He yelps again, angry. He picks up a rock lying in the street and charges towards an unfinished house. He hurls the rock through its front window. Glass crashes down. A silent beat passes, and then the front door of the house opens and a late-20s, long-greasy-haired, wiry shirtless guy in filthy black jeans emerges. He has a baby moustache and a cracked front tooth. This is HESHER. He makes a determined line toward TJ.}

Hesher makes a very serious finger-to-mouth gesture to 'shhhh'. The SOUND of a car idling outside. Hesher listens. TJ is on his stomach, freaked. TJ looks around the room - a duffel bag, some beer cans, a few porn magazines, a weathered bass guitar and a sleeping bag. A car door closes loudly. Hesher peers through the window and sees a SECURITY GUARD inspecting TJ's bike in the front yard and then making his way toward the house. Hesher looks at TJ with serious and considered venom.}

<ACTION>__{TJ jumps to his feet and looks out the window. A dirty black van screams out onto the road and tears away, spraying dirt and rocks in its wake.
