<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{close on impassive eyes. they are asian. we have seen them before. pull back to see... kabuo miyamoto. early 30's, dark blue suit, clean shirt. he sits ramrod straight, utterly motionless, expressionless, the eye of a storm of movement in... ...the assembling courtroom. a packed gallery of buzzing locals, the scent of anticipation. a bank of reporters and photographers, cosmopolitan in attire, bearing themselves as jaded dignitaries from the civilized world. as we pan their ranks...}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{it was the first murder trial on the island in thirty one years.}
<A>__{...we look over the right shoulder of ishmael chambers, early 30's, dark, a rugged, somber man jotting notes on a pad which rests on his right leg.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{our only newspaper was the san piedro review, a four page weekly that i operated alone.}
<A>__{he glances blandly at his nonchalant colleagues.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{what, i wondered, could the seattle boys know of the hearts of these people...}
<A>__{to the jury box. truck farmers, grocers, fishermen, in sober neckties. a waitress, a secretary, fisher wives in sunday dresses.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{neighbors, sitting in judgement. on their neighbor.}
<A>__{to the neighbor. the ramrod still defendant.}
<C>__{ishmael }

<A>__{ishmael writing on the pad balanced precariously on his knee, until...}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{did he know how dangerous his demeanor could be? with this jury.}
<A>__{...it falls with a clatter of pages. he reaches with his right hand, replaces the pad on his thigh. around him, cameras are being swung to the ready. ishmael looks to see... ...a slender woman of refined beauty, entering the courtroom. a few flashes pop, and ishmael's right hand retrieves a venerable box camera from beneath his seat, as his notepad falls once more, unheeded.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{hatsue miyamoto had been without her husband for 77 days.}
<A>__{ishmael pivots, and we understand his struggle with the notepad. for he is forced to rest his camera on the stump of his amputated left arm, its empty sleeve pinned at the elbow.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{he was in jail. when his baby son learned to walk.}
<A>__{through his viewfinder, we see hatsue take her place in the first row. and sensing her presence, her husband turns. their eyes meet. a string of flashes... but none from ishmael. he hesitates. as if considering whether he will violate this woman's privacy. the camera lowers. hold on his face...}
