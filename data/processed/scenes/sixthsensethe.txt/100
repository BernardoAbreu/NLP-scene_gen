<A>__{malcolm walks from the bus stop over the cobblestone streets in front of head house square. the streets are quiet and dark. night time has fallen over the city. he slowly comes to a stop in front of an old building. he holds his arm up. uses his other hand to gently touch his hairs on his arm's surface. malcolm looks up slowly. looks around. the dark shadows fill the corners of the historic building... malcolm stares into the darkness... beat.}
