<A>__{members of the royal family and upper household hurry into the icy dining room and take their designated places at the luncheon table. everybody is dressed in mourning and nobody speaks. wind whistles through the open windows. silence. among the diners we catch our first glimpse of bertie, the prince of wales. he is in his mid twenties, plump, stiff dressed and balding. he stands next to his young wife, princess alexandra, who fiddles nervously with her shawl, trying to keep warm. as bertie smooths down his thinning hair, doctor jenner bustles into the dining room, stands himself next to ponsonby and proceeds to conduct a hurried conversation with the prince of wales, entirely in whispers.}
