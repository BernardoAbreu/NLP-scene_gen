<A>__{a place of money and privilege. white coral buildings surround an open yard. tile roofs rise among banyan trees and banana palms, shimmering before a blue blaze of sky. beyond the yard is the school's playing field and beyond that the waters of biscayne bay, dappled in sunlight where the sloops of the school's sailing class bob at their moorings. for a moment all is quiet. then, faintly, the hum of many voices, rising and falling, laughter. the camera pans to the open windows of a building somewhat larger than the others. the sounds grow louder.}
<L>__{interior blue bay auditorium day}
<A>__{a hundred high school kids sit before a raised, hardwood stage. the students are not unlike the campus, radiant, well tended a veritable sea of adolescent sexuality bronze boys who seem to have just come from the boats or tennis courts girls in tight shorts riding high up shapely thighs, as... sam lombardo strolls out onto the stage. the man is thirtyish, drop dead handsome. dressed not that differently from the kids, in an izod polo shirt, khakis and boat shoes. his entrance has an effect upon the audience, particularly upon the girls. karen and janelle, 16, pretty blondes, whisper then giggle. nicole, a dark eyed beauty, 17 but going on 25, watches sam's walk, then turns to the girl at her side... kelly van ryan, 17, a fully developed knockout.}

<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{boos as we find... jimmy leach, 18, grumge look, long hair. he sits with a clique of white trashy types, or at least what passes for such at blue bay school. jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does... suzle toller, a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a loner. she studies sam lombardo with a dark, sullen stare.}

<A>__{an old black and white, with that sepia caste harkening back to another age. a handsome young man of perhaps 14 stands at the helm of a boat under sail. his hair is swept back, his eyes fixed upon an unseen horizon. there is something in this boy's pose, in the line of his jaw, in the clarity of his gaze, as if what he has fixed upon is the future itself.}

<D>__{can i play too? or is it just for boys?}
<A>__{sam and jimmy turn to find kelly van ryan at the far end of the dock. she's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse knotted at the bottom to reveal a flat, tanned stomach; open at the top to reveal the swelling of her breasts. she favors sam with a coy smile.}

<A>__{sam's jeep rolls out of the drive, jimmy's bike in back, meaning that jimmy and kelly are squeezed into the passenger seat, which is fine with jimmy. kelly's thigh is pressed against his. his arm pushes against her breast. kelly is not so happy. as they near the school's entrance, they come upon a beat to shit vw bug stalled at a stop sign. a john deere tractor mower sits nearby. a groundsman a tall black guy with a shaved head, waits at the wheel of the bug as... suzie toller in black platform shoes, a t shirt and cutoff jeans, leans over the engine, fiddling with the car's linkage. sam pulls up next to the bug and stops.}

<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{that's cute.}
<A>__{suzie gives her the finger. sam makes eye contact with suzie, offers a sad smile, while putting the jeep in gear.}
