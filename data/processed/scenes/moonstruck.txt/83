<D>__{i teach these classes i've taught for a million years. the spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. i started off, i was excited about something and i wanted to share it. now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. except sometimes. sometimes i'm droning along and i look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and i'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. and when that happens, when i look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way i always wanted to be and maybe once was, then i ask her out on a date. it doesn't last. it can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that i'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. and at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.}
