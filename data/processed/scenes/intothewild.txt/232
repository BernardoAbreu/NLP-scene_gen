<A>__{he closes the door and the car drives off. we follow chris as he goes to the overpass edge. he drops his pack over the side. chris climbs down the edge of the overpass, grabs his pack, and scurries into the underpass below. (we suddenly recognize this as his pre river run campsite) he digs up his buried belongings, returning them to his pack. last to come out of the ground, chris' copy of jack london's call of the wild. he pulls off a temp wrapping and dusts it off. chris lights his candle lantern and begins to read. o.s. voices from the past:}
