<L>__{interior spicoli's trailer home morning}
<A>__{it is a messy trailer, part of a trailer park by the sea. spicoli's area is small, but he has made it his own. the walls are covered with posters, almost all of them naked centerfolds. it is obvious spicoli's parents are not welcome in his room.}

<D>__{dad says you have to get up!}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{ugh.}
<A>__{he groans, starts to struggle out of bed.}
<C>__{spicoli }
<D>__{leave me alone!}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{dad says you're late again, you butthole!}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{leave me alone.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{dad says!}
<A>__{spicoli reaches over to the floor next to his bed. he pulls a snorkel from the mess, heaves it at the door and his little brother. it bounces off the wall and doesn't even hit curtis, but the kid starts crying anyway.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{daaaaaaaad! jeff threw a snorkel at me!!!!!!}
<A>__{spicoli gets out of bed, groans again, and kicks the door shut.}
