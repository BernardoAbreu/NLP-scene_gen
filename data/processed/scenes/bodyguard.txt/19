<L>__{interior family room day}
<A>__{frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is coming from. it is large and comfortable with plenty of seating, a bar, a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth. it is packed with people, props and video equipment. there is lots of activity, a general air of barely organized chaos. music blares out. a group of six dancers, is rehearsing an energetic dance number for a music video, directed by their choreographer rory. sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the glass wall at the end of the room. a video cameraman circles them, taping the rehearsal, which appears on a large screen tv behind them. in one corner, a pretty black girl is being pinned into a proposed costume for the video. several people are stand ing around, tending to the video and playback gear. all the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn't immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among the big cushions. as frank sits on the barstool at the back, a large swivel chair turns to reveal devaney. he waves to frank and makes his way over to him. on the other side of the room, a brawny, heavyset man in his late thirties rises to look at frank. he has a twenty inch neck. devaney signals to him that everything is all right. the brawny man looks at frank a moment more, then sits down. frank looks around the room. a shelf laden with vitamins. guitars of various makes. a flute. a gold record being used as a coaster. people smoking and chatting through the rehearsal. in one of the chairs, a pretty woman in her mid thirties (nicki, the woman we saw at the premiere) is knitting. she glances occasionally at the dancers. a man sits next to a phone busily discussing a contract with someone at the other end of the line. the music climaxes and abruptly stops. the dancers hold their dramatic final poses for a second, then relax again. applause. the clapping from the front sofa is loudest. then laughter. from elsewhere in the room comes the voice of the video}
<B>__{director.}
<C>__{director }
<D>__{playback, everybody!}
<A>__{rachel's voice comes from the sofa.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{come here, rory!}
<A>__{the choreographer skips to the sofa and disappears from sight. sound of kissing, laughter. the video rewinds on the big screen and the dancers gather round it expectantly.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{sugar, that's gonna be great. i love the ending...}
<A>__{devaney moves to the front of the room. the playback starts behind him. there are several overlapping conversations going on.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{rachel...}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{nicki, how'd you like the number? you like the end routine?}
<C>__{director }
<D>__{rachel. you wanna see it back from the beginning or just the ending...}
<A>__{nicki, responds to rachel's question.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{it was just great, rory...}
<A>__{but rachel is already replying to the video director.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{i wanna see it all. tony? i will bet tony loved it.}
<A>__{the brawny man, tony, shrugs and stands to look at frank as he speaks.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{ehh!}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{don't worry, rory. tony doesn't appreciate great art.}
<A>__{the pinned up girl has been brought forward for rachel's approval, elbowing devaney a little to one side.}
<C>__{dress designer}
<P>__{(showing the costume)}
<D>__{what do you think, rachel?}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{rachel, frank farmer is...}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{devaney, do you think this is me?}
<C>__{devaney}
<P>__{(not looking)}
<D>__{it's terrific...}
<A>__{devaney is now facing the unseen rachel.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{rachel, frank farmer is here.}
<A>__{devaney nods in frank's direction. nicki looks at frank.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{who's here?}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{frank farmer.}
<P>__{(getting no response)}
<D>__{the bodyguard.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{i think rory should be my bodyguard.}
<P>__{(to dress designer)}
<D>__{let's see the back again...}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{rachel, raise your butt out of there and meet this man.}
<A>__{rachel marron finally rises from the sofa. it's a bit of a shock to see that she is only about thirty years old. a young woman. not beautiful, not ugly. unique only in that she is immediately interesting. a superstar.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{well, i'm up.}
<A>__{rachel and frank look across the room at each other. frank comes forward.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{frank farmer, rachel marron.}
<A>__{rachel offers her hand and they shake. rachel looks him up and down.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you don't look like a bodyguard.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what did you expect?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i don't know. tough guy maybe.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{this is my disguise.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{well, his timing's good.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{this is nicki, rachel's sister and personal secretary.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{nice to meet you, mr. farmer.}
<C>__{devaney}
<P>__{(indicating)}
<D>__{... tony scibelli.}
<A>__{tony nods but makes no move to shake hands. rachel dismisses the dress designer.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(to designer)}
<D>__{the back's still not right...}
<A>__{spector, still on the phone, offers a perfunctory wave.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{... sy spector, rachel's publicist.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{can we get you a drink?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{orange juice.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{straight? nicki.}
<A>__{nicki goes to the bar. rachel sits and motions for frank to sit opposite her.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{rory, i will be with you in a second.}
<A>__{rory gets up, and goes over to his dancers at the big screen video.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{listen, this whole thing is bill's idea... this sudden obsession with protecting me. tony has always handled my security and we've done just fine.}
<C>__{spector }
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{yes, i will hold but not long...}
<C>__{rory }
<D>__{rachel, you want to run through your steps before we go again...?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i will be with you in a second.}
<A>__{nicki hands frank his orange juice. she looks at frank as she speaks.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{i think bill's right, rachel. it's time you took more precautions.}
<A>__{spector enters the conversation.}
<C>__{spector}
<P>__{(one hand covers the phone)}
<D>__{nicki, i'm sure mr. farmer would tell you the number of nuts writing fan letters jumps every time rachel is on the cover of a magazine.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{not like this.}
<A>__{an assistant hands rachel a small sheaf of phone messages, some papers for signature and a pen. rachel checks through them and signs as she talks.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{relax guys, i said i'd do it. you see what i'm dealing with here? i'm willing to go along, as long as we all understand each other. i'm not going to let this alter my life one little bit.}
<P>__{(to assistant)}
<D>__{who was this?}
<C>__{assistant}
<P>__{(overlapping devaney)}
<D>__{oh. that was clive's office. they called three times...}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{honey, that's not going to be a problem.}
<C>__{devaney }
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{rachel runs a very informal household, we're all on a first name basis...}
<A>__{spector has finished up on the phone and jumps in.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{...and i'm sure you'll blend in just fine. you can select whatever alarm systems you want for the house. some kind of improved security for the gate. what else, rachel?}
<A>__{rachel stands and starts to wander over to rory and the dancers. frank looks at devaney. devaney doesn't like the tone this is taking.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i think i'm safe when i'm here at the house so i guess the main thing will be when i go out. tony will be able to fill you in on all that. you two will have to work something out. i don't want both of you falling all over me everywhere i go. the most important thing is this i will not allow fletcher to be affected by this thing...}
<A>__{rory puts his arm around her waist and stands behind her, starting to run through her steps with her in slow motion.}
<C>__{spector}
<P>__{(punching phone)}
<D>__{i was just going to cover that. we'll have to tell the child you have some other function...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i don't want him to think he's in prison. so the house and grounds must not be altered in any way. he shouldn't be aware that you're here. is that clear?}
<A>__{frank looks at her a long time, glancing up at devaney once.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{miss marron...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{rachel.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{there's been a mistake. a misunderstanding. if you'll show me the quickest way out, we'll save each other a lot of trouble.}
<A>__{frank's on his way. someone brings a silver headpiece on a stand to rachel. she ignores it, still looking at frank.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{you can go past the pool.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{shut up, tony.}
<C>__{farmer}
<D>__{nice meeting you.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{farmer, will you wait a minute?}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{bill, i don't think we should be begging this guy for his services.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{sy, i'm handling this.}
<A>__{rachel looks on coolly as frank slides open the glass door.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{farmer, will you wait a minute?}
