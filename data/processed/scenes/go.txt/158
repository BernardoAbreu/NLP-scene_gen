<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{irene slides a plate under the candlestick, where wax is dripping onto the tablecloth. burke tips the bottle at adam.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{more wine?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{no. he doesn't want any more. unless he does, do you?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{this has been great, just wonderful, but we're going to need to leave. soon. adam's not feeling well.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i'm not. it's true.}
<A>__{burke and irene share a look.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{if you gotta go, then i understand.}
<P>__{(awkward beat)}
<D>__{but irene and i sort of had an ulterior motive inviting you here.}
<A>__{zack looks to adam.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{he makes it sound sinister. it's not.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{she's right. okay, you've looked around our place. where do you think we got most of this stuff?}
<A>__{adam and zack shake their heads.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{just guess.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{sears?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{j.c. penney's?}
<A>__{irene and burke both smile.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{it's actually from confederated products. almost everything in this house is from confederated products, from the toilet paper to the mattress to those candles.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{the wine.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{even that cologne you liked.}
<P>__{(practiced)}
<D>__{see, confederated products is a multi level direct wholesaling company. that means we don't just sell the products ourselves, we also recruit and manage teams who work under us. irene and i started eight months ago and we're already bringing in fifty thousand a year in revenues.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{we're the number four distributor in southern california. by march, we might be number three.}
<A>__{she crosses her fingers. so does burke. we look to zack, horrified.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{now, as law enforcement officers, irene and i can't recruit distributors from inside the force. it's against the rules and we'd get fired. so what we do is look for people in other industries...}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{...like the entertainment industry.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{wait.}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{you want us to sell amway.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{confederated products. it's a different company, different quality of product.}
<A>__{zack and adam share a look of disbelief and wonder.}
