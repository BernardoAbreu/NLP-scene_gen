<A>__{pi reaches into a pouch behind his back, taking out a piece of fish. he places it on the end of the stick and reaches out, offering it to richard parker, who sniffs the air. pi puts the fish on the bench. richard parker eats the fish, then backs up, growing calmer. pi takes out another fish, reaches out to tap the bench, then tosses the fish on the bench. richard parker takes the fish, eats. pi tosses the next piece near the edge of the tarp and taps, encouraging richard parker to follow his direction.}
