<A>__{bud, in raincoat and slippered feet, turns in off the street, plods along a path in the deserted park. he stops at a damp bench under a lamp post, sits. in the background, lights shine from the towering buildings on central park south. bud huddles inside his raincoat, shivering. he is very sleepy by now. his eyes close and his head droops. a gust of wind sends wet leaves swirling across the bench. bud doesn't stir. he is all in.}
