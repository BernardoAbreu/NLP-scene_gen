<L>__{interior bishop's house. day}
<A>__{a landing at the top of a crooked, wooden staircase. there is a threadbare, braided rug on the floor. there is a long, wide corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and battleships. the wallpapers are sun bleached and peeling at the corners except for a few newly hung strips which are clean and bright. a small easel sits stored in the corner. outside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling the gutters. a ten year old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully eating a bowl of cereal as he walks. he is lionel. lionel slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window. he takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove. a child's voice says over the speaker:}
<C>__{record player }
<D>__{in order to show you how a big symphony orchestra is put together, benjamin britten has written a big piece of music, which is made up of smaller pieces that show you all the separate parts of the orchestra.}
<A>__{as lionel listens, three other children wander out of their bedrooms and down to the landing. the first is an eight year old boy in a bathrobe. he is murray. the second is a nine year old boy in white boxer shorts and a white undershirt. he is rudy. the third is a twelve year old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee high socks and brightly polished, patent leather shoes. she is suzy. she carries a one month old striped kitten. the boys drop down to the floor next to their brother. they lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their fists, listening. suzy sits in the windowsill. she opens a book called shelly and the secret universe. there is an illustration on the cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her neck. suzy starts to read then pauses. she lowers her book. she raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes. she looks out into the rain.}
<L>__{exterior bishop's house. day}
<A>__{a rickety, three story, stone and shingle house on a hillside with turrets and a widow's walk. a weather vane swings creaking on the roof. tree tops sway in a cluster below. the sea is almost invisible in the misting rain, and the mainland is a shadow across the sound. suzy sits in the high window, watching.}
<T>__{titles over:}
<A>__{the family stuck indoors all day out of the rain. in bedrooms, bathrooms, and corridors, we see the boys. they shoot marbles. they throw jacks. they play cards. they eat grilled cheese sandwiches together in the kitchen. in half open doorways, we see the parents. mr. bishop is a tall, fifty year old man in madras trousers and horn rimmed glasses. he reads the newspaper and drinks coffee. mrs. bishop is a tan, forty five year old woman in a lilly pulitzer type wrap around skirt. she washes her hair, topless, in the kitchen sink. in windows, we see suzy with her binoculars. she watches wet branches shaking in the woods. she watches a man in a slicker fishing from a row boat. she watches a white colt in a field. she eats a bowl of tomato soup alone in the pantry. in the distance, a seaplane flies by below the clouds.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the edge of a cliff above a white beach. a rocky peninsula curls into the background. brisk wind rustles the tall grass. a fifty year old man, bald on top with long hair on the sides, stands next to a surveyor's levelling instrument on a tripod. he wears rubber boots and a parka. he is the narrator. he speaks to the camera:}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{this is the island of new penzance. sixteen miles long. forested with old growth pine and maple. criss crossed by shallow tidal creeks. an important seabird habitat. there are no paved roads but instead many miles of intersecting foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry that runs twice daily from stone cove. the year is 1965. we are on the far edge of black beacon sound, famous for the ferocious and well documented storm which will strike from the east on the fifth of september in three day's time.}
<L>__{exterior scout camp. day}
<A>__{a clearing in the woods with ten small, khaki tents pitched in a row. a banner on a flag pole ripples in the wind. it reads camp ivanhoe. a bugler in a khaki uniform with a yellow neckerchief plays a staccato tattoo. he has a gauze patch over one eye. he is lazy eye. a thirty five year old man in the same uniform emerges through the flaps of a larger tent. he is scout master ward. he puts on a wide brimmed felt hat. a badge on the crown reads khaki scouts, troop 55. he lights a cigarette. a thin scout with curly hair and sunglasses joins him at his side. he is gadge.}

<D>__{nickleby. spot check.}
<A>__{nickleby stands up. he looks extremely disheveled.}

<D>__{your socks are down. your shirt tails are untucked. your trousers are not properly pressed. you are reported for uniform violation!}
<A>__{gadge makes a note. nickleby slouches. scout master ward strides away. he stops in front of a work bench covered with newspaper where one scout sifts green powder through a funnel into cardboard tubes and another makes wax stoppers with a metal press. they are panagle and izod. a sign on the side of the table reads no smoking. scout master ward hands his cigarette to gadge, who holds it away at arm's length.}

<D>__{sixteen and a half.}

<A>__{the motorcycle skids to a stop in front of scout master ward, engulfing him in a thick cloud of dust. he coughs and waves his arms in the air. as the smoke clears, we see that the rider is a bronze, all american looking boy with blond hair. he is redford. his motorcycle has flames painted on the gas tank. he tries to cover for himself:}

<C>__{scout master ward}
<D>__{morning, chef.}

<C>__{scout master ward}
<D>__{shakusky? you in there?}

<A>__{scout master ward looks concerned. he produces a wooden handled scout pocket knife. he unfolds a few blades and gadgets and decides quickly on a thin tool with a hook on the end. he crouches down and slips the hook through a small gap at the base of the flap, twists left and right, then pulls up briskly, unzipping the tent.}
<L>__{interior scout tent. day}
<A>__{the lining of the tent is printed with images of trees and pine cones, and a plaid rug covers the floor. there is a foot locker, a gas lamp, a chair with a folded blanket over it, and an empty cot. scout master ward steps inside slowly, bent over, examining the space. he lifts the lid of the foot locker. he looks under the corner of the mattress. he picks up a piece of folded yellow notebook paper sticking out from under a pillow. he opens it and stares at it. he turns suddenly to the chair against the wall of the tent and slides it aside. there is neat but slightly jagged hole the size of a basketball cut through the fabric in the back corner. scout master ward looks to his staring troop.}
