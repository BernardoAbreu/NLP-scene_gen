<L>__{interior twilight lounge night}
<A>__{an old black guy in a frayed, threadbare tux plays piano. bud, nursing a highball at the bar, steps over to a redhead with too much make up on too many miles.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{that an old fashioned you're drinking?}
<P>__{(as she nods)}
<D>__{my name's bud.}
<C>__{redhead}
<D>__{nobody was born with the name bud.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{they stick you with a name like wendell, you look for an alias.}
<C>__{redhead}
<D>__{what do you do, bud?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i'm sorta between jobs. look, what do you say we, uh...}
<A>__{a hand on bud's shoulder. he turns to see dudley smith.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{lad, may i have a word with you?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{this business, captain?}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.}
<A>__{dudley starts off. bud turns back to redhead, but she's already talking to a sailor.}
<B>__{booth}
<A>__{dudley sits at a table. a newspaper is opened, a little mound underneath. bud joins dudley.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{does that paper say we've been indicted? does it say exley's a hero for squealing me and stensland off?}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{he made his play amd he got what he wanted. they're making him a detective.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{captain, what do you want?}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{call me dudley.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{dudley, what do you want?}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{lad, i admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner. i admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. and i am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters. do you hate them, wendell?}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(looks away)}
<D>__{yeah, i hate them.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{and for good reason judging from what i know of your background.}
<A>__{bud looks back over. dudley's getting too personal.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what's going to happen to stensland? he'll give himself cirrhosis over this. he's one year from his pension .}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{it would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him. why the loyalty, wendell?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{he helped me out once. that's all.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{your partner's through. department scapegoat on the chief's orders. he's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{him and me both. fucking exley .}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{don't underestimate his skills. as a politician he exceeds even myself. but the department needs smart men like exley and... direct men like yourself bud what do you want ?}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{wendell, i want you to come to work for me.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{doing what? mowing your fucking lawn?}
<A>__{smith yanks the newspaper revealing bud's badge & .38 special. bud can't believe his eyes.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{they're yours. take them.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i knew you had juice, but... there's no goddamn bill on me?}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{four of the defendants recanted their testimony.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{dudley dismisses the question with a wave of his hand.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{i need you for an assignment the chief's given me the go ahead on. a duty few men are fit for, but you were born for. you'll be working out of homicide.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{homicide? a detective?}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{your talents lie elsewhere, wendell. it's a muscle job and shooting job. you'll do what i say and not ask questions. do you follow my drift?}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{in technicolor.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{will you work for me?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{of course... but how?}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{how what, wendell?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{how'd you get them to retract?}
<A>__{dudley lays brass knuckles on the table. they're chipped, caked with blood.}
