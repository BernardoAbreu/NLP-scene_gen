<A>__{joe steps into... andrew's hospital room (interior night) ... a hand painted banner is strung over andrew's bed: "victory." opera music plays on a portable cd player. andrew lies in a hospital bed, with a pressurized oxygen mask on his face. jill sits on the edge of andrew's bed, holding his hand, smiling, speaking to andrew in low tones. with his free hand, andrew gently strokes jill's forearm. (andrew has an amazing assortment of tubes and ivs running into various parts of his body.) andrew's brothers matt and randy are sipping beers with rev. jim, miguel, miguel's sister maria, bruno and chandra, while matt does a dramatic re creation of the marine juror rendering the judgment. matt's audience is loving it. as joe comes into the room, jill rises to take the shopping bags from him. joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others. people keep their voices low, but there's a certain energy, and happiness evident in the room. on andrew: watching his friends and relatives with sparkling eyes and a weak, but grateful and peaceful smile. on joe: glancing across the room, catching andrew's look. andrew smiles at joe and pats his hospital bed, indicating he wants joe to sit there. joe crosses the room, sits on the edge of the bed. with some difficulty, andrew removes his oxygen mask. his voice is raspy, weak:}
