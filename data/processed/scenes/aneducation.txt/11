<A>__{david reaches across jenny while driving slowly, opens the glove compartment and takes out a packet of cigarettes.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{smoke?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i'd better not. i'm a bit close to home.}
<A>__{david lights one for himself.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i suppose cellists must go to a lot of concerts.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{we don't go to any concerts. we don't believe in them.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh, they're real.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{so people say.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why don't we believe in them?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i suppose...what would he say?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{your father, this is?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(darkly)}
<D>__{oh, yes. he'd say there's no point to them. they're just for fun. apart from school concerts, of course, which are no fun at all, so we go to those. the proper ones don't help you get on.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{which of course is what is so wonderful about them. anyway, you'll go one day.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(heartfelt)}
<D>__{yes. i will. i know. sometimes it seems as though that's what all this slog is for. if i get to university, i'm going to read what i want and think about what i want and listen to what i want. and i'm going to look at paintings and go to french films and talk to people who know lots about lots.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{good for you. which university?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oxford. if i'm lucky. did you go anywhere?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i studied at what i believe they call the university of life. and i didn't get a very good degree there.}
<A>__{jenny smiles.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{this is me. thank you.}
<A>__{she gets out of the car with the cello. david stares after her for a moment, then drives off.}
