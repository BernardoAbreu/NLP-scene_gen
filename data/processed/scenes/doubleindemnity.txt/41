<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{so i took her to dinner that evening at a mexican joint down on olvera street where nobody would see us. i wanted to cheer her up..}

<A>__{d 5 interior neff's coupe (day) neff and lola driving along the beach near santa monica. neff is wearing a light summer suit, very much in contrast to lola's mourning. apparently she is telling him a story and now and then she laughs, but there is no sound. camera moves past her to a: close shot of neff behind the steering wheel. he is only half listening to lola. his mind is full of other thoughts.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{next day was sunday and we went for a ride down to the beach. she had loosened up a bit and she was even laughing... i had to make sure she wouldn't tell that stuff about phyllis to anybody else. it was dynamite, whether it was true or not. and i had no chance to talk to phyllis. you were watching her like a hawk, keyes. i couldn't even phone her for fear you had the wires tapped.}
<A>__{d 6 insurance office 12th floor day neff, with his hat on and no briefcase, is walking toward keyes' office. as he comes up close to the door, he stops with a startled expression on his face. on a chair beside the door sits a familiar figure. he is jackson, the man from the observation platform of the train. he is wearing his stetson hat and smoking a cigar. he is studying something in the file folder. neff recognizes him immediately but jackson does not look up. neff controls his expression and goes on to open the door to keyes' office.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{monday morning there was a note on my desk that you wanted to see me, keyes. for a minute i wondered if it could be about lola. it was worse. outside your door was the last guy in the world i wanted to see.}
<A>__{d 7 interior keyes' office neff is just closing the door from the inside. keyes, his coat off, is lying on his office couch, chewing on a cigar, as usual.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{come in. come in, walter. i want to ask you something. after all the years we've known each other, do you mind if i make a rather blunt statement?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{about me. walter, i'm a very great man. this dietrichson business. it's murder, and murders don't come any neater. as fancy a piece of homicide as anybody ever ran into. smart and tricky and almost perfect, but }
<A>__{keyes bounces off the couch like a rubber ball.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{but, i think papa has it all figured out, figured out and wrapped up in tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i'm listening.}
<A>__{keyes levels a finger at him.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{you know what? that guy dietrichson was never on the train.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{he wasn't?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{no, he wasn't, walter. look, you can't be sure of killing a man by throwing him off a train that's going fifteen miles an hour. the only way you can be sure is to kill him first and then throw his body on the tracks. that would mean either killing him on the train, or and this is where it really gets fancy you kill him somewhere else and put him on the tracks. two possibilities, and i personally buy the second.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you're way ahead of me, keyes.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{look, it was like this. they killed the guy the wife and somebody else and then the somebody else took the crutches and went on the train as dietrichson, and then the somebody else jumped off, and then they put the body on the tracks where the train had passed. an impersonation, see. and a cinch to work. because it was night, very few people were about, they had the crutches to stare at, and they never really looked at the man at all.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it's fancy all right, keyes. maybe it's a little too fancy.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{is it? i tell you it fits together like a watch. and now let's see what we have in the way of proof. the only guy that really got a good look at this supposed dietrichson is sitting right outside my office. i took the trouble to bring him down here from oregon. let's see what he has to say.}
<A>__{keyes goes to the door and opens it.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{come in, mr. jackson.}
<A>__{jackson enters with the file folder.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{yes sir, mr. keyes. these are fine cigars you smoke.}
<A>__{he indicates the cigar he himself is smoking.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{two for a quarter.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{that's what i said.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{never mind the cigar, jackson. did you study those photographs? what do you say?}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{yes, indeed, i studied them thoroughly. very thoroughly}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{well? did you make up your mind?}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{mr. keyes, i'm a medford man. medford, oregon. up in medford we take our time making up our minds }
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{well you're not in medford now. i'm in a hurry. let's have it.}
<A>__{jackson indicates the file folder he is holding.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{are these photographs of the late mr. dietrichson?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{then my answer is no.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{what do you mean no?}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{i mean this is not the man that was on the train.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{will you swear to that?}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{i'm a medford man. medford, oregon. and if i say it, i mean it, and if i mean it, of course i will swear it.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{keyes turns to neff.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{there you are, walter. there's your proof.}
<A>__{keyes remembers he forgot to introduce jackson.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{oh, mr. jackson, this is mr. neff, one of our salesmen.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{please to meet you, mr. neff. pleased indeed.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how do you do.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{very fine, thank you. never was better.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{mr. jackson, how would you describe the man you saw on that observation platform?}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{well, i'm pretty sure he was a younger man, about ten or fifteen years younger than the man in these photographs.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{dietrichson was about fifty, wasn't he, walter?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{fifty one, according to the policy.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{the man i saw was nothing like fifty one years old. of course, it was pretty dark on that platform and, come to think of it, he tried to keep his back towards me. but i'm positive just the same.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{that's fine, jackson. now you understand this matter is strictly confidential. we may need you again down here in los angeles, if the case comes to court.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{any time you need me, i'm at your entire disposal, gentlemen. expenses paid, of course.}
<A>__{keyes picks up the telephone on his desk and speaks into it.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{get me lubin, in the cashier's office.}
<A>__{meanwhile, jackson crosses over to neff and, during the ensuing dialogue between him and neff, we hear keyes' low voice on the phone in background. we do not hear what he says.}
<C>__{jackson}
<P>__{(to neff)}
<D>__{ever been in medford, mr. neff?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{never.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{wait a minute. do you go trout fishing? maybe i saw you up klamath falls way.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{nope. never fish.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{neff. neff. i've got it! it's the name. there's a family of neffs in corvallis.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{no relation.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{let me see. this man's an automobile dealer in corvallis. very reputable man, too, i'm told.}
<A>__{keyes rejoins them at this pointerior}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{all right, mr. jackson. suppose you go down to the cashier's office room twenty seven on the eleventh floor. they'll take care of your expense account and your ticket for the train tonight.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{tonight? tomorrow morning would suit me better. there's a very good osteopath down here i want to see before i leave.}
<A>__{keyes has opened the door for jackson.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{okay, mr. jackson. just don't put her on the expense account.}
<A>__{jackson doesn't get it.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{goodbye, gentlemen. a pleasure.}
<A>__{he goes out.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{there it is, walter. it's beginning to come apart at the seams already. a murder's never perfect. it always comes apart sooner or later. and when two people are involved it's usually sooner. we know the dietrichson dame is in it, and somebody else. pretty soon we're going to know who that somebody else is. he'll show. he's got to show. sometime, somewhere, they've got to meet. their emotions are all kicked up. whether it's love or hate doesn't matter. they can't keep away from each other. they think it's twice as safe because there are two of them. but it's not twice as safe. it's ten times twice as dangerous. they've committed a murder and that's not like taking a trolley ride together where each one can get off at a different stop. they're stuck with each other. they've got to ride all the way to the end of the line. and it's a one way trip, and the last stop is the cemetery.}
<A>__{he puts a cigar in his mouth and starts tapping his pockets for matches.}
<C>__{keyes}
<P>__{(continued)}
<D>__{she put in her claim and i'm going to throw it right back at her.}
<P>__{(pats his pockets again)}
<D>__{have you got one of those?}
<A>__{neff strikes a match for him. keyes takes the match out of his hand and lights his cigar.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{let her sue us if she dares. i will be ready for her and that somebody else. they'll be digging their own graves.}
