<A>__{there are sayings on the wall: "easy does it;" "let go and let god;" "turn it over;" "one day at a time..." "h.a.l.t. hungry? angry? lonely? tired?" caroline, wearing a thick, woolly sweater, and the other patients sit around on beat up couches and chairs in a loose circle. it's a mixed bunch: trucker meth head, rocker dope fiend, yuppie crack head, fat, thin, rich, middle class, and all white. caroline is the youngest. marty, 40's, an overweight alcoholic, finishes his "share."}

<D>__{so it was my birthday an my ex wife was getting remarried and i was in some church basement telling a bunch of strangers how it was a good day because i didn't have to eat out of a dumpster. that was enough to send me out on big one.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i've been thinking a lot about the first step: that i came to believe i was powerless over alcohol and that my life had become unmanageable.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{see my disease tells me i don't have a disease. that i'm fine. that it's my birthday and i can have one little drink, then one little line, then one little valium, then two more fat lines, then two more 10 mil valium... six months later i wake up in a sober living house in philly. and i'm from dallas, people.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's a disease an allergy of the body and an obsession of the mind. i know that now. so my name's marty and today i'm a grateful recovering alcoholic who didn't eat out of a dumpster. thanks.}
<A>__{and marty looks to caroline who didn't relate to one word he said.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(slowly, very nervous)}
<D>__{hi. i'm caroline. i'm not sure i'm an alcoholic.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i mean i don't really like to drink. for someone my age it's so much easier to get drugs than beer. i don't know, this is really weird and i'm really nervous...}
<A>__{people in the room nod encouragingly.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i guess i'm angry. i mean i think i'm really angry about a lot of stuff, but i don't know what exactly.}
<A>__{she blushes, and stares out the window.}
