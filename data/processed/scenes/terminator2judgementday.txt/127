<L>__{interior interview room pescadero night}
<A>__{the photos are lying on the table in front of sarah, placed there by detective weathersby. his partner det. mossberg, and dr. silberman, sit at the table as well. two uniformed cops, plus douglas, stand by the door. sarah stares listlessly at the top photo. she's withdrawn, haggard... drugged looking.}
<C>__{mossberg}
<D>__{he killed seventeen police officers that night. recognize him?}
<A>__{weathersby slaps another black and white eight by ten on the table. a closeup of terminator taken by the japanese tourist at the mall. it's the same face.}
<C>__{mossberg}
<D>__{this one was taken by a japanese tourist today.}
<A>__{sarah doesn't react. it's hard to tell she's thinking. whether she's up hope or is just in a drugged stupor.}
<C>__{weathersby}
<D>__{ms. connor, you've been told that your son's missing. his foster parents have been murdered, and we know this guy's involved. talk to us. don't you care?}
<A>__{sarah stares up at him. a cold and empty stare. he glances at silberman. then at his partner.}
<C>__{mossberg}
<D>__{we're wasting out time.}
<A>__{one of the uniformed cops opens the door and mossberg strides into the hall. weathersby and the two uniforms follow him out, with silberman right behind.}
<C>__{silberman}
<D>__{sorry, gentleman...}
<A>__{tight on sarah, slumped under the bright lights. totally out of it. then we see her hand, creeping along the edge of the table toward the stack of photos. she slips off the paper clip binding the stills together, and hides it between her fingers. douglas jerks her up by the arms and leads her out.}
