<L>__{exterior mine new world day}
<A>__{excavations carved into a hillside. it is a blisteringly hot day. at the foot of the hill, giacomo sits at a table beneath an awning, with moxica and several clerks. one hundred fifty indians standing in line at the table. in turn, they hand over a small quantity of gold. the clerk weighs it on a scale, and notes down each contribution. moxica impatiently gestures the indians to move faster with a thonged crop. an indian approaches the table. he is nervous. he doesn't produce anything. the indian shakes his head, gesticulates, starts to speak rapidly.}

<D>__{he says he has not found any!}
<C>__{moxica}
<D>__{he's lying!}
<A>__{again the indian pleads and gesticulates. moxica hits him across the face with the thonged crop. the indian tries to run away but is held by a spanish soldier.}
<C>__{moxica}
<D>__{bring him here!}
<A>__{the frightened indian is brought back to the table. one of the clerks slips away.}
<C>__{moxica}
<D>__{tell him to put his hands on the table. like this!}
