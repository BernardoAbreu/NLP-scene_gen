<A>__{billy, with the same deadened expression as before, comes down the stairs towards the wheel. it is early morning and the walkers haven't started yet. billy looks at the pillar a dire look of reflection passing over his eyes. then he starts walking but in a clockwise motion, opposite the normal pattern; in the same methodical manner as before.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{billy, on the inner track, passes two lunatics who are walking counter clockwise. they glare at him, motion for him to turn around. billy just keeps walking. billy intersects several more lunatics going counter clockwise they motion for him to turn.}

<P>__{(grunting)}
<D>__{gower!}
<A>__{tries to block billy's way, but billy shakes his head, brushes by him determined. ahmet slides up next to billy in his rags.}
<C>__{ahmet}
<D>__{good morning, my american friend! there will be trouble if you go this way. a good turk always walks to the right. left is communist. right is good. you must go the other way... it's good.}
<A>__{more lunatics join the flow, gesturing or grunting at billy. billy stops, turns, looks at the rest of them slogging in the usual direction, looks as if he 'sees' them; and he walks out of the wheel, towards the stairs. ahmet curious about his unusual behavior, follows billy.}
<C>__{ahmet}
<D>__{why you go? why don't you walk the wheel with us?}

<D>__{to know oneself is to know god, my friend. the factory knows. that's why they put you here. you'll see. you'll find out. later on you'll know.}
<A>__{billy stops and turns to look at ahmet. his eyes glint with special knowledge and he takes ahmet into his confidence using the latter's tone of voice:}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i already know. i know that you're a bad machine. that's why the factory keeps you here.}
<P>__{(lowers s voice)}
<D>__{you know how i know? i know because i'm from the factory. i make the machines.. i'm here to spy on you.}
<A>__{eyes narrow. surprise. fear. he shuffles away. billy looks at him and turns up the stairs.}
