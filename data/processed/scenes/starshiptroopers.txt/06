<T>__{flashback:}
<L>__{interior new uni high classroom day carmen ibanez}
<A>__{is beautiful, just 18, and quite pleased with herself because johnny rico is clearly infatuated with her.}
<C>__{rasczak }
<D>__{the end of another school year, and for me no doubt another failure... rico, pay attention !}
<A>__{the teacher jean rasczak, 38, a rugged veteran who proudly displays his missing hand, scowls at johnny, bemused.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{sorry, mr. rasczak.}
<A>__{but as soon as rasczak turns back to the class, johnny begins to sketch a cartoon on his desk's touch screen.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{here in history and moral philosophy we've explored the decline of democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos, and how the veterans took control and imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since... you know these facts but have i taught you anything of value ? you. why are only citizens allowed to vote ?}
<A>__{rasczak points at lanny, 17, with his stump .}
<C>__{lanny}
<D>__{it's a reward... what the federation gives you for doing federal service.}
<A>__{rasczak is crestfallen, makes a big show of patience.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{no. something given has no value ! haven't i taught you dimwits anything ? i guess they ought to revoke my teaching credential...}
<A>__{laughter. johnny's cartoon, meanwhile, is taking shape: johnny and carmen flying round planet venus in a space ship.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{when you vote, you're exercising political authority. you're using force. and force, my friends, is violence, the supreme authority from which all other authority derives.}
<A>__{carl jenkins, 18, a superintelligent geek, jumps in.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{gee, we always thought you were the supreme authority, mr. rasczak.}
<A>__{laughter. rasczak grins.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{in my classroom, you bet. whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion, political authority is violence by degree. the people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it.}
<A>__{dizzy flores, 18, athletic, pretty, no nonsense, chimes in.}
<C>__{dizzy}
<D>__{my mother always says that violence never solves anything.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{really ? i wonder what the city fathers of hiroshima would have to say about that. you.}
<A>__{rasczak points at carmen.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{they probably wouldn't say anything. hiroshima was destroyed.}
<A>__{johnny presses "send" on his desk, and the cartoon appears across the way on carmen's screen.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{correct. naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor. the contrary opinion 'violence never solves anything' is wishful thinking at its worst.}
<A>__{while rasczak looks away, carmen throws johnny her wonderful smile, and johnny's gone, checked out, flying round venus.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{people who forget that always pay... they pay with their lives and their freedom.}
<A>__{dizzy notices the dreamy look on johnny's face. so does rasczak. he points at him with his stump, snaps johnny to.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{you. tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{the difference lies in the field of civic virtue. a citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. the civilian does not.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{the exact words of the texterior but do you understand it ? do you believe it ?}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{uh, i don't know.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{of course you don't. i doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.}
<A>__{a bell rings. rasczak shrugs, indifferent.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{well, that's it. have a nice life.}
