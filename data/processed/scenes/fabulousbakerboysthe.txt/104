<L>__{interior lobby}

<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{thrilling.}
<P>__{(glancing at jack)}
<D>__{both of you.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{the audience was a little off tonight.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{a few empty tables. it's cozier. besides, mel torme couldn't fill this place on a wednesday night.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i guess you're,right. well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? theo's should still be open.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{no, no. you boys are tired.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, we're not. jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{i'm tired. really. i should get home.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{just call me a cab.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{a cab? ma, come on. my car's just a half block down. you wait here.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{frank dashes out of the lobby. jack and mrs. baker watch him go, then turn to each other. mrs. baker smiles awkwardly, then surveys the lobby.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's beautiful, isn't it?}
<A>__{the brocade on the walls has faded and the chairs once covered with velvet, now with a cheap imitation look old and dowdy, but the room still maintains an elegant dignity.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{this was quite,a place once. after the war. on friday nights they had dances in the ballroom upstairs. it was beautiful. crystal chandeliers. white tablecloths. orchids floating in the punch bowls... it was a wonderful place to be young.}
<A>__{jack watches his mother as her eyes pass over the room. after a moment, she nods toward the lounge.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it went well tonight.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{frank works hard.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{and you don't?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he leads, i follow.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{is that the way it is?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{pretty much.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{he mentioned you had a girl for a while. a singer.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{for a while. she left.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{yes, well, it's probably best. no sense bringing someone else in.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i suppose.}
<A>__{mrs. baker glances into the lounge, at the two pianos.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{funny. watching tonight, i was remembering when you were young. how i used to stand in the kitchen, listening to the two of you practice while i did the dishes.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{my two little radios. sometimes i'd stop and go to the door and just watch. sometimes your father would too.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{he liked to listen to you play. did you know that?}
<A>__{jack shakes his head.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you miss him, don't you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's been a long time, ma.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i supposed you still have that old phone booth.}
<A>__{jack nods. mrs. baker smiles, then it fades.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{his love scared me, you know. the day he died he left a flower on my pillow.}
<A>__{jack looks puzzled. suddenly his mother reaches out and very gently touches her fingers to his face.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you look so like him.}
<A>__{they stand like this for a moment, connnected, then frank steps in from the street.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{your limo's ready, ma.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{mrs. baker takes her hand from jack's face and turns away. just before she exits, she looks back.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{good night, jack.}
