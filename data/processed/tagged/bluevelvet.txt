<D>__{right out in the car i happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. i will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. i will spray her apartment. after a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and i will then jimmy a window.}

<A>__{jeffrey sees a furious frank come storming out of the back room and come slowly up the hall directly toward him. jeffrey raises his pistol very slowly. frank enters the living room. he looks around. the yellow man moans. frank makes a face and blasts the remainder of the yellow man's head away and this time the yellow man falls dead to the floor. jeffrey tenses in the silence which hangs in the air. frank looks to the kitchen. all around the living room. he looks at the closet. he smiles he slowly goes right toward jeffrey smiling. jeffrey points the pistol. his finger moves to the trigger. he squints his eyes. he doesn't want to kill a man. any man. frank comes right to the closet door and throws it open, when jeffrey hears sandy scream.}

<A>__{a huge low roaring sound comes in. slowly we come up out of a huge dark hole. we see we are rising out of an ear but still among the crevices. they look enormous. we move up and float above the ear and traverse across a cheek to an eye. jeffrey's eye. his face is bathed in light. all sorts of springtime in the garden sounds are heard. we suddenly see that jeffrey is sleeping in his back yard. detective williams is with mr. beaumont working in the garden in the distance. the sprinkler is turning. sandy comes out on the back porch and calls.}

<C>__{sandy}
<P>__{(referring to the bird)}

<A>__{a songbird sings in a tree. we are in a beautiful park. slowly we move down and a little hat with a propeller comes into view. the hat is on the head of a small child who is dancing slowly toward dorothy. she is laughing. when the boy gets within arms reach they embrace. we move close to dorothy's smiling face. tears of happiness come into her eyes, but there is still a distant look as we hear bobby vinton sing the last lines of his song. "and i still can see blue velvet through my tears." blue velvet dissolves in and takes over the image.}
