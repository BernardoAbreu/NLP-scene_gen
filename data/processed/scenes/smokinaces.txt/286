<A>__{the diner. the day before.}
<C>__{carruthers}
<D>__{ heller was buried in agency lore }
<T>__{cut back to scene:}
<A>__{messner, head in his hands.}
<C>__{locke}
<D>__{the agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable...until now. you can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in d.c. heller's op predates the second world war. that's over sixty years of intel. do you know how valuable that could be? the man's a treasure trove.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{...so you made another deal?}
<C>__{locke}
<D>__{i wouldn't go that far.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{but you did, and have...and now people are dead.}
<P>__{(beat, seething)}
<D>__{did sparazza become more valuable than israel...and did you make another deal?}
<A>__{a beat. locke, a reluctant nod.}
<C>__{locke}
<D>__{israel's agreement with the government was tossed out. we're now attempting to rehabilitate him to the point where a transplant can be attempted.}
<A>__{messner glowers at locke...can't believe what he's hearing.}
<C>__{messner}
<P>__{(with disgust)}
<D>__{you're trying to save sparazza?}
<C>__{locke}
<D>__{no...we're trying to save heller.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{...so you knew all this and yet y }
<C>__{locke}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{ we needed cohesion to move forward. not conjecture.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{...while carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. the bureau's betrayed us...}
<P>__{(pointing to sparazza)}
<D>__{the way they betrayed him...}
<C>__{locke}
<D>__{i don't see it like that at all.}
<A>__{messner's head falls into his hands.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{no, of course you don't...of course you don't.}
<P>__{(long reflective pause)}
<D>__{...i gave all my belief and the better part of my soul to this bureau.}
<P>__{(beat, looking at the wraith like sparazza)}
<D>__{...look at the monsters you've made...}
<P>__{(beat, profoundly sad)}
<D>__{i won't be one of them.}
<A>__{locke, swallowing hard, struggling to assert his authority.}
<C>__{locke}
<D>__{i will overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. you've been fully debriefed. now i want you to return to d.c. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. i mean it. it's closed.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{no...it's not.}
<P>__{(tossing messner his fbi id)}
<D>__{what it lacks...is an end.}
<A>__{locke, not getting it as messner takes aim on the oxygen tent containing sparazza. locke's eyes inflate, he reaches grabs gropes noooo ! israel, the faintest of smiles as boom.}
<B>__{the end}
