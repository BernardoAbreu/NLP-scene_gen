<L>__{exterior hollywood blvd. day}
<A>__{betty walks aimlessly along a busy street. she moves without direction, in a daze until a glint of bright light hits her, causing her to turn. she is staring at a black lincoln sitting in a car lot, sunlight dancing off its chrome. she shudders involuntarily at it. suddenly, she hears a familiar voice.}
<C>__{del }
<D>__{what the hell are you doing here?}
<A>__{it's del. he's in a pastel version of his usual shirt, slacks, and tie.}
<C>__{del }
<D>__{well, are you gonna answer me? what'd you come here for?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i came for love...}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{you're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'cause you know what that is?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{it's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{that's right. so, if you know it, why are you in trouble?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{you sure don't. who do you think you are coming to hollywood, anyway? you should remember where you came from. and who you really are.}
<A>__{del looks up at the sun for a moment, shading his eye from it.}
<C>__{del }
<D>__{i gotta run. got some serious clients to meet, with real potential.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{goddamn, it's hot!}
<A>__{he wipes the sweat from his brow. betty looks at his handkerchief and sees that it's soaked in blood. then back at his face, now obscured by blood pouring down from his head. she stares, horrified, and in that moment del becomes... a man, staring back at her as he wipes the sweat from his brow.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{who are you talking to? are you crazy?}
<A>__{betty backs away and melts into the flow of pedestrians.}
