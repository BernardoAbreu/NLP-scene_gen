<L>__{interior karen's home lower hallway}
<A>__{karen steps out of her old kitchen expecting, hoping to be back in the forest again. nope. she blinks. then she starts to walk down the corridor. more pictures on the wall this time. one of a woman and another of a man (karen's mom and dad). karen's sure of it now. she's home. the center of her worst nightmares. she creeps along to the main stairs. and that's when the noises begin. a thumping from upstairs. a crash, like something hit the floor above. more thumping, repeatedly and then human moaning, the sound of pain. somebody is getting beaten.}

<D>__{oh no...}
<A>__{something is twisting deep inside the girl. her face goes shallow as she slowly shuffles around to the foot of the stairs...and starts to climb them.}
<B>__{on the stairs}
<A>__{karen goes up, step by painful step, as the sounds of the beating increase in their intensity. every hit seems to touch karen as she flinches. she's afraid to go on but can't seem to stop.}
