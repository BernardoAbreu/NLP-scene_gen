<L>__{interior bus night}
<A>__{continuation of the music from scene 3. georges and anne are seated side by side in the half empty bus. anne talks enthusiastically, georges says something from time to time, and smiles now and then. they are both relaxed and happy.}
<L>__{interior apartment hallway night}
<A>__{the door to the apartment is unlocked and opened from the outside. the music ends. georges comes in, turns on the light. he and anne observe the open door. around the lock, one can see the traces of an attempted forced entry. georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep grooves.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{they used a screwdriver or something like that...it doesn't look very professional...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but who would do something like that?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{no idea. why do people break in? because they want to steal something.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{from us?}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(laughs briefly out loud)}
<D>__{hey, why not? if i thought about it, i could come up with at least three or four people we know who've been burgled.}
<A>__{after having examined the outside of the second leaf of the double door, he comes in, closing the door behind him.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what time is it? can't we call the superintendent?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i will do that tomorrow morning. anyway, they didn't see anything.}
<A>__{he unbuttons his overcoat and heads toward the large closet in the hallway.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{don't let it spoil your good mood now.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{or the police?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{come on, give me your coat.}
<A>__{she goes toward him, he takes her coat off and hangs it with his in the closet.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{imagine if we were here, in our beds, and someone broke in.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{why should i imagine that?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but it's terrible! i think i'd die of fright.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{so would i.}
<A>__{he undoes his shoes.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{shall we have a drink?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i'm tired.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i still fancy a drink.}
<A>__{he puts away his shoes with the others and slips on his slippers. anne has gone into the bathroom.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{go ahead then. mathilde told me that in her building, the attic apartment was burgled from the loft. they just knocked a hole in the wall, cut out all of the valuable pictures from their frames and disappeared without a trace.}
<A>__{he goes toward the kitchen.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{they must have been professionals.}
<A>__{as he passes in front of the bathroom, he stops and appears to be looking at anne.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{did i tell you, you looked good tonight?}
<A>__{short pause. then:}
<C>__{anne }
<P>__{(flattered)}
<D>__{what's got into you?}
<A>__{with a gentle laugh, georges disappears into the kitchen, where he turns on the lights. we hear him fiddling around, apparently getting a glass and some wine. after a short}
