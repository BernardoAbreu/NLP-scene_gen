<A>__{the limo pulls into the parking lot of the tops limousine service. fifty other limos are already parked there. jelly and jimmy get out, followed by ben, now dressed in shiny suit and pinky ring.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior tops limo garage continuous action}
<A>__{ben, jelly, and jimmy enter a garage the size of a small airplane hangar. the floor has been cleared and long tables set up to form a square in the middle of the room. wiseguys with shotguns patrol the catwalks above the floor and soldiers are posted at all the doors.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{i can't do this. i'm telling you, i cannot do this.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{don't fucking whine! whining's a dead giveaway. come on! you're the consigliere, for chrissake.}
<A>__{around the tables sit forty or fifty of the biggest gangsters in the world. a few captains stand around the perimeter, ready to serve their bosses.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{these are the bosses? that one looks like my uncle max.}
<A>__{jelly steers ben to an empty seat next to carlo mangano.}
<C>__{mangano}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{what's goin' on? where's vitti?}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{on his way. don't worry.}
<A>__{mangano eyes ben with contempt.}
<C>__{mangano}
<D>__{what's he doin' here?}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{he's it's okay. forget about it.}
<C>__{mangano}
<D>__{forget about it? what the hell is that?}
<A>__{seated directly across the room from ben is primo sindone. he stares hard at ben, trying to place him, then leans over to moony, his consigliere.}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{who's the guy with jelly?}
<C>__{moony}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{ben looks away nervously.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(to jelly, borderline hysterical)}
<D>__{i can't do this.}
<A>__{he starts to get up but jelly pulls him back down. moony stands up and gets everyone's attention.}
<C>__{moony}
<D>__{all right, gentlemen. i think we better start. we have a big agenda, so for now let's stick to the big issues. and it would help if you identify yourselves when you speak, since we don't all know each other, and we didn't think anybody would be into wearing any fucking name tags.}
<A>__{laughter around the table. sindone stands up and looks straight at ben.}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{i'm primo sindone. they call me sonny long. it's good to see so many of the old faces here, and to welcome the new ones from all over the country. i see frank zello, and joe baldassare, but i'm a little disappointed to see that the head of our other new york family isn't here today. all i see is his man jelly and some sawed off little prick nobody knows.}
<A>__{jelly looks at ben, waiting for him to speak, but ben just sits, frozen, looking down at his hands.}
<C>__{jelly}
<P>__{(stands up, rattled)}
<D>__{yeah, well, the thing is mr. vitti has been detained and he sends his apologies for being detained and he apologizes for his detainment.}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{detained? what kind of bullshit is that? what's more important than this? as the host of this meeting, i take his not being here as a sign of disrespect to me and to all these other men, too, who came a long way to be here.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{mr. vitti meant no disrespect. the thing is, he's not feeling well. he's sick and he didn't feel well }
<A>__{ben rises and slaps jelly hard across the face.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{jelly! we don't ever discuss mr. vitti's health outside the family. you know better.}
<A>__{jelly is stunned. the bosses murmur.}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{all right, who is this guy and what the fuck is he doing here?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{in answer to your first question, my name is ben sobol }
<P>__{(off sindone's look)}
<D>__{ leone. sobboleone. they call me 'the doctor.' as for your second question. i'm here representing paul vitti. as his conser conghili }
<C>__{jelly}
<P>__{(prompting)}
<D>__{consigliere }
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(slaps him again)}
<D>__{don't you ever correct me again! as his consigliere, i'm intimately involved in all aspects of the family business and i'm prepared to speak for mr. vitti on all matters.}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{okay, doctor, then let's get down to business. everybody knows there's been this thing between me and paul vitti for a long time.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{which thing are you talking about? the first thing or the second thing?}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{what second thing? i only know one thing.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, i don't see how we can discuss the first thing without bringing up the second thing. didn't you talk to the guy?}
<A>__{he tugs meaningfully on his earlobe.}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{what guy?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{the guy with the thing.}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{what thing? what the fuck are you talking about?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how should i know? you brought it up.}
<P>__{(gestures helplessly to the others)}
<D>__{this is the whole problem. you can't have an intelligent conversation with the man.}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{how about if i just break your fuckin' neck? what do you think of that?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's not important what i think. what do you think?}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{what do i think? i think it's a good idea! why would i say it if i didn't think it was good?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i don't know. why would you?}
<C>__{sindone}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{i wouldn't! that's what i'm saying!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{have you always had a problem dealing with your anger?}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what do you think i'm talking about?}
<C>__{sindonsindone}
<P>__{(explodes)}
<D>__{i don't know what the fuck you're talking about!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{see, you're angry again. do you feel you have to get angry to be heard?}
<A>__{sindone turns to a couple of other bosses, frank zello and joe baldassare.}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{what's he talking about?}
<C>__{zello}
<D>__{i don't know. but you do have a tendency to get angry a lot.}
<C>__{baldassare}
<D>__{i agree, primo.}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{i'm trying to talk about vitti! why are we talking about me?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{interesting. do you feel you're not worthy enough to be talked about?}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what do you think it means?}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{zello}
<D>__{primo, calm down.}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{calm down? how can i calm down when this prick won't stop with the questions?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{could you pass the fruit, please?}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{that's it! you're a dead man!}
<A>__{sindone whips out a pistol and points it at ben, but just as he's about to shoot }
<C>__{vitti }
<D>__{primo!}
<A>__{all eyes turn.}
<B>__{paul vitti}
<A>__{he's standing there, staring at sindone, cool, clear, and unafraid. he looks like a king. the room goes silent. vitti looks around the table, nods, and crosses to ben. jelly gets up to greet him.}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(quietly, to jelly)}
<D>__{wait outside with the car running.}
<A>__{jelly nods and exits.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{saving your ass. sit down. i will take it from here.}
<A>__{ben sits, greatly relieved.}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(to the group)}
<D>__{i'm paul vitti. i'm sorry i was late. those of you who know me will know i meant no disrespect. if it's all right with you, there's something i'd like to say, then i will leave you to your business.}
<A>__{ben looks at vitti and sees a kind of serenity and clarity he's never seen before.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{about two and a half weeks ago, somebody killed my friend, dominic manetta.}
<A>__{he looks straight at sindone.}
<C>__{sindone}
<D>__{don't look at me. everybody knows you whacked him so you could take over everything.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{what i really came here to say is that i've come to a very important decision in my life. i want out.}
<A>__{a great murmur of surprise sweeps around the room. ben looks at him proudly.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i'm going away for a while, but i will respect the oath i took the day i was made, and whatever i know about anyone else's business, i take with me to the grave. you have my word.}
<A>__{a negative buzz among the bosses.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{as for my own organization, i know carlo mangano would like to be the new boss.}
<A>__{mangano smiles gratefully.}
<C>__{mangano}
<D>__{thank you, paul.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{that's why he betrayed dominic and me to our enemies and sent his own man to kill me in miami.}
<A>__{mangano is stunned.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{but i leave it to my people to deal with that and choose their own boss. and even though it's my right, i won't take revenge, mostly because i'm in a good place mentally and feeling good about me.}
<C>__{zello}
<P>__{(perplexed)}
<D>__{i don't know, paul. i can see where some people might have a problem with this.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i realize that, so as an extra token of good faith between us, i've taken the liberty of writing down everything i know and putting it in a safe deposit box in case anything happens to me or my family.}
<A>__{there's a long tense silence while the other bosses consider all this. then, finally }
<C>__{zello}
<D>__{i don't know what anybody else thinks, but i say good luck and god bless, paul.}
<C>__{baldassare}
<D>__{good luck, paul. salut.}
<A>__{they all raise their glasses and toast vitti. ben raises his glass to vitti and drinks.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(to vitti)}
<D>__{well done.}
<A>__{vitti smiles at him and drinks.}
