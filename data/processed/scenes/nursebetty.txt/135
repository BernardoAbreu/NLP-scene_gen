<A>__{charlie watches betty undress from a nearby fire escape. he stares at the object of his desperate search with relief and some fascination. betty's movements are unhurried, mindless. charlie stares, mesmerized, until she steps into the shower.}
<L>__{exterior rosa's apartment street same time}
<A>__{wesley gently nudges open the trunk to betty's lesabre. the cardboard cut out of david ravell pops out at him.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{whoa! what the fuck're you doing here?}
<A>__{he breaks it over his knee and throws it in the gutter, then quickly removes the wing nut holding the spare tire. he removes the tire, then raises the panel on the floor of the trunk as charlie joins him.}
<C>__{wesley }
<D>__{it's all here. it hasn't been touched.}
<A>__{the bottom of the trunk is lined with brown paper wrapped bricks of cocaine. charlie stares at it, shaking his head.}
<C>__{wesley }
<D>__{you were right. del wasn't lying.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, you were right about what that bartender said.}
<A>__{wesley looks at him. he appreciates the compliment.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{but you were right first. you gotta follow your instincts.}
<A>__{charlie takes a long look at wesley and smiles proudly.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{leave. take this shit back to detroit and get the rest of our money.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we could do that. i could be on my way to florida, and you could go to thailand and fuck your brains out.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? this is it for me, wesley, she's the last one. my instinct says i gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing i've tried to teach you here }
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{it's to follow my instincts. and my instincts say get the fuck out of dodge.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, i said to follow 'my' instincts. now, we go up there and conclude our business. case closed.}
<A>__{charlie walks off. wesley closes the trunk up and prepares to follow him.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{... oh, that's fucking democratic.}
