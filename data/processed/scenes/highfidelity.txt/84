<D>__{i want to see the others on the big top five. penny, who wouldn't let me touch her and then went and had sex with that bastard chris thompson. sarah, my partner in rejection who rejected me, and charlie, who i have to thank for everything: my great job, my sexual self confidence, the works. there's this springsteen song, "bobby jean," off born in the usa. about a girl who's left town years before and he's pissed off because he didn't know about it, and he wanted to say goodbye, tell her that he missed her, and wish her good luck. well, i'd like my life to be like a springsteen song. just once. i know i'm not born to run, and it's clear that halsted street is nothing like thunder road, but feelings can't be that different, can they? i'd like to call up all those people and ask them how they are and whether they've forgiven me, and tell them that i have forgiven them. and say good luck, goodbye. no hard feelings. and then they'd feel good and i'd feel good. we'd all feel good. i'd feel clean, and calm, and ready to start again. that'd be good. great even.}
