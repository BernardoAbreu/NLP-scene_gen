<L>__{interior exterior cab one & montana sail}
<A>__{lindsey is approaching the monolith of the sail, maneuvering to clear the horizontal diving plane. then her lights go dim and her thrusters loose power. suddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail and something appears right in front of her, a glowing object moving like a bat out of hell right at her! it is slightly smaller than submersible and we only get a glimpse. what we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent ovoid, open at the front with a spinning vortex of light inside... like some hallucinatory jet engine. and it's hauling ass. lindsey jinks left. the object jogs right. she fights the control as her sub slews around, slamming broadside into the sail. k bam! her power comes back up. righting can one, she spins to look through the aft viewport in time to see the object racing away in a broad arc. it pulls a high g turn and dives straight down. we see the object zip behind flatbed. one night can't see it. the thing spirals down into the darkness like a hit and run drunk, diving along the wall into the abyss until it is lost to view. hold on lindsey excited, amazed... dazed. her hands are shaking. suddenly bud's voice blares out over the open frequency.}
