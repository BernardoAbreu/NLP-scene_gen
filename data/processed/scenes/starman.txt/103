<D>__{gate three. it's boarding now.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{have a nice trip.}
<A>__{we follow jenny through the people milling around the benches in the waiting area to the star man seated in an open faced coffee shop. he is watching a mother feed her baby in the booth across from him. a map of the united states is spread out on the formica. jenny plunks herself down catty cornered from him. the tear in his sleeve has been closed with safety pins.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells...}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(pointing to baby)}
<D>__{is that a baby?}

<C>__{star man}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i can't... forget the baby. okay? the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells. you'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.}
<A>__{the star man looks at the map. lathrop wells is a small town north of las vegas on highway 95. from there he runs his finger to a spot in the funeral range of death valley.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{but i must go here.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i know that. but the buses don't go there.}
<C>__{star man}

<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{that's easy. i will explain that in a minute. this is your ticket. when you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. you will ride to omaha. when you get to omaha, ask the driver. 'salt lake city, please. i do not speak english.'}
<A>__{the star man nods that he understands.}
<C>__{jenny}

<C>__{star man}
<D>__{'salt lake city, please. i do not speak english.'}

<D>__{'las vegas, please. i do not speak english.' what is hitchhike?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you want this ticket?}

<A>__{jenny takes a few sweeps at an imaginary highway with her thumb. the stares this pantomime draws make the star man more nervous about the bus trip than he already is.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{the car will stop?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(continuing toward the loading platform)}
<D>__{not every car, but... a car will stop... maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...}
<A>__{the star man stops.}
<C>__{star man}
