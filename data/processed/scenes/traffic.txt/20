<L>__{interior office, del mar self storage day}
<A>__{it's a cluttered, rundown working office unusual only in the extent of its ordinariness. a secretary goes about her business like a somnambulist. clerks shuffle and file. castro switches into spanish }
<C>__{castro}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{good afternoon, ladies, gentlemen. we're looking for eduardo ruiz. we have a two o'clock appointment.}
<L>__{interior office, del mar self storage later}
<A>__{in a back alcove, castro and gordon sit across a cheap table from eduardo ruiz, 40's, an entrepreneur in an expensive suit and bad hairpiece. they are waiting.}
<C>__{ruiz}
<D>__{you ever buy a quarter ton? not many people have.}
<A>__{another "businessman" enters from another door and whispers in ruiz's ear, then leaves again.}
<C>__{ruiz}
<D>__{so, it's worth the wait, right? what can i do? rent a huey? have an airlift? it's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right? how many peasants would that take? a line stretching from here to mexico city }
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{nobody said shit, eduardo }
<A>__{one of ruiz's hands dips under the desk where we see a handgun is holstered on the underside.}
<C>__{ruiz}
<D>__{relax. we're waiting, that's it.}
<C>__{castro}
<D>__{hey, you want to hear a joke? i got a joke. why do women wear makeup and perfume?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{chill out }
<C>__{castro}
<D>__{it's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick. why do women wear makeup and perfume?}
<C>__{ruiz}
