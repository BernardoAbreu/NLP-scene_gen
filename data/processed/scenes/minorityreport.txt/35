<A>__{anderson looks in the door of witwer's empty office. he takes a step inside. witwer's booming voice sounds from behind him, startling him.}

<A>__{witwer immediately scans his old partner's ashen face.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{anderson can hardly bear to meet his friend's eyes. he reaches into his pocket, as if to lift the disc into the light. if he could just do that, show it to witwer.}
