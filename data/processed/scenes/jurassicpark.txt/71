<L>__{ext field in the park }
<A>__{grant and kids walk through a clearing. lex stops.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i hear something.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{timmy looks around. the morning is still and peaceful. branches are motionless. only a little bird jumps from one branch to another.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{hear it now?}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{you're hearing things. come on, we gotta get back and warn them about the boat.}
<A>__{lex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind. she runs betw een grant and timmy. then they all hear it. honking. it comes from the herd of duck bills behind them. first the honking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another and another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{they're agitated.}
<A>__{the duckbills twist and turn. they hurry out of the water, circling the young ones to protect them. with a roar, the t rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away straight toward the hadrosaurs.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i told you i heard something!}
<A>__{the earth shakes. a low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin to run in a parallel direction to the course of grant and the kids.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{outta the way, kids! run!}
<A>__{grant grabs lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like a football. timmy runs beside them. hadrosaurs run alongside of them. grant hears the crashing of trees. he takes a glance over his shoulder. grant's pov a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd into changing direction. the hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into the path of grant, lex and timmy. they all scream. back on control room the quiet black room. hammond stands by the big window. his pensive presence affects all in the room. arnold looks at his illuminated watch.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{memory should be cleared by now.}
<A>__{he pushes the main switch back on. nothing on.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{damn.}
<A>__{arnold pushes the switch off and then on again. still nothing. he glances at hammond's back. sweat forms on his brow.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{oh hell! i have to turn the safety switches back on before i restart the power.}
<A>__{arnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers. holding his breath, he turns on the main power switch. first, there is the computer beep. ellie jumps. then relaxes. the lights come on. the screens hum. hammond's shoulder twitches slightly.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{thank god!}
<A>__{the room is jubilant. hugs and cheers. ellie picks up a phone.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{arnold! they're still not working.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{no, it sounds dead but after a reset, all system modules have to be brought on line manually.}
<A>__{arnold quickly goes back to work at his console. hammond turns.}
<C>__{wu}
<P>__{(to hammond)}
<D>__{arnold's about to get the phones up.}
<A>__{arnold pushes the chair back.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{okay, we're up again!}
<A>__{ellie grabs the phone back up.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{no we're not. phones still dead.}
<A>__{arnold swings her way.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{can't be }
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{my god, look at this, arnold.}
<A>__{hammond points to the transparent map. a tight cluster of dots by the lagoon move in a coordinated way. moving fast, in a kind of swirl.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{what's happening?}
<C>__{arnold}
<P>__{(tonelessly)}
<D>__{the duckbills.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{my good god.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{it's the rex ...}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{they've stampeded ...}
<A>__{back on the hadrosaurs low angle on the stampede grant and kids run for their lives. behind them the duckbills charge with surprising speed. their enormous bodies charge in a tight group, kicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along. close on a charging duckbill as he honks, eyes wild with fear. a horrible roar of the t rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and struggling to stay out from underfoot.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{ a huge adult foot almost tramples the infant. frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the maelstrom. the frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust. grant and lex and timmy run wildly. the stampede is very close behind grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust. another deafening roar of the t rex. grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers. the animals continue to close. close on the running feet of the stampeding animals. the ground vibrates every time it is struck by the huge feet. grant and the kids scramble onto the rocks. they frantically tuck in between big boulders as the the herd reaches them. lex shields her dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks. grant pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks. grant's pov the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass. another slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood. stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl ying in the air. above, even the birds are running. disoriented, they fly frantically along. grant and the kids are enveloped in dust. just shadows of huge bodies with giant limbs. bellows of pain as animals wheel and circle. a boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward timmy. he dives out of his rocky hiding place. the boulder continues on toward grant and lex. they dive after timmy. the group buries itself anew in a group of thick roots tangled amidst smaller rocks. the boulder continues on, smashing the rocky enclave they have just left. grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under bellies oscillate above them. the stampede goes past. they lie there, unable to move. they watch the herd trample on. close on the rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor. lex screams. grant and timmy cover her mouth. the t rex hunts down the herd. he targets his prey. a young hadrosaur. as the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the rex lunges fiercely. the rex and its victim are enveloped in dust. grant holds lex close. she watches the terrible cloud with a quiet horror. timmy makes the first move to leave.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{let's go. now!}
<A>__{the herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle. grant, lex and timmy run in the opposite direction. back on control room hammond, arnold, wu, and ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly clears. hadrosaurs scatter. now the rex is calm and quiet. back to camera, he gnaws on something.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{no! oh no! he make a kill. he killed one of my animals! where's muldoon?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. hammond.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{my animals! my animals!}
<A>__{muldoon enters, limping in. hammond is very upset.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{where have you been? my rex killed a hadrosaur. you should be out there, doing something.}
<C>__{mul}
<B>__{doon}
<D>__{i just came to tell you you're minus one computer expert.}
