<L>__{interior theater lobby later}
<A>__{the boisterous crowd is in high spirits. people congratulate ed and pat him on the back. "it was great!" "it's your best one yet!" "bela would've loved it!" ed drifts through the crowd, basking in the glory. it's like a wonderful dream.}
<L>__{exterior theater same time}
<A>__{the rain comes down in sheets. the doors burst open, and ed and kathy run out.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{ed, i'm so happy for you.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{let's get married.}
<C>__{kathy}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{huh?! ed right now . let's drive to vegas!}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{but it's pouring. and the car top is stuck!}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(he gives his killer grin)}
<D>__{so? it's only a five hour drive. and it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert. heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner. i promise.}
<A>__{kathy stares in disbelief. then she smiles. they kiss. ed and kathy jump into the open convertible. the engine starts, and they drive away, disappearing into the pouring rain. a moment. and then, we move up, up, into the black clouds. lightning cracks across the sky.}
