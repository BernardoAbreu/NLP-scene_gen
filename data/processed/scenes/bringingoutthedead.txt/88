<D>__{mary burke. she's a friend.}
<C>__{kanita}
<D>__{she's not here.}
<A>__{frank pushes past her.}
<C>__{kanita }
<D>__{wait a minute. you can't go in.}
<A>__{cy coates, 45, light skinned black, stands in the smoky room. dark curtained windows block the sunlight; a dirty fish tank casts a green glow across the beat up furniture. a large framed photo of a volcano hangs over the couch.}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{it's okay, kanita. come on in.}
<C>__{kanita}
<D>__{he looks like a cop.}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{he's not a cop, he's a medic.}
<P>__{(extends hand)}
<D>__{i'm cy coates.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{frank pierce.}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{mary said you might be coming.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{sleeping in the back.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{she asked me to pick her up.}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{i know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. terrible about her father, isn't it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i better just go in and see her.}
<A>__{kanita sits on the sofa next to an unshaven sleeping man. coates gestures:}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{i call this the oasis. refuge from the world out there. did you know two people were shot in this building last week?}
<A>__{frank heads down the hall toward the rear of the apartment; coates follows. they pass an open door where inside tiger, a fat man with dried blood running down the corner of his mouth, sits punching computer keys at a desk.}
<C>__{coates }
<D>__{careful. that's the tiger. the lady's down the hall. welcome to sunrise enterprises, frank, the stress free factory.}
<A>__{in the next room mary lies on a mattress on the floor, yellow sheet pulled up to her neck. frank leans over her:}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{mary. mary, we've got to get going.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(groggy)}
<D>__{no, no.}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{she wanted something to help her sleep.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{mary, we really have to go.}
<A>__{mary blindly swings her fist at him, collapses unconscious back to the mattress.}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{frank, she's suffered enough. she's okay, i promise.}
<P>__{(puts hand on frank's shoulder)}
<D>__{c'mon, frank.}
<A>__{coates escorts frank back to the living room.}
<C>__{coates }
<D>__{i'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as i can imagine. here, sit down. what's it like? tell me some war stories.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(sits)}
<D>__{got a beer?}
<A>__{cy sits across from him, pulls out a pin sized joint, lights it:}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{that shit is poison, frank. we don't drink alcohol here. what you need is one of these.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{did you give mary something called red death?}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{red death?}
<P>__{(passes joint to kanita)}
<D>__{tell me something, frank does killing your clients make good business sense to you? the kids selling that shit have no sense. they'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i should be going. i just quit.}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{sleep is all stress reduction. here.}
<P>__{(offers white pill)}
<D>__{you take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.}
<P>__{(frank hesitates)}
<D>__{why do you think i'm telling you this, frank for my health? you ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. kanita, get him a glass of water.}
<A>__{frank watches as kanita gets up, walks to the kitchen. coates places the pill in his hand.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{is this what you gave mary?}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{that's the stuff. i call it the red lion. very king of the jungle.}
<A>__{no language, only brute power. you can't believe how relaxing it is. kanita returns with a glass of water, gives it to frank; coates stands, feeds the fish.}
<C>__{coates }
<D>__{frank, i'm trying to help you. drink up.}
<A>__{frank swallows the white pill, drinks the water. he places his arms on the chair:}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i guess i will be going.}
<C>__{coates}
<D>__{just take it easy.}
<A>__{frank looks around the smoke filled room. kanita walks over, extends her hand.}
<C>__{kanita}
<D>__{take my pulse.}
<P>__{(he does)}
<D>__{it's good, isn't it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{perfect.}
<C>__{kanita}
<D>__{i knew it. i was wrong about you. you're not so bad.}
<A>__{kanita runs her hand across his shoulders. frank starts to nod. the room getting warm and dark. his eyelids lower: sleep, precious sleep.}
