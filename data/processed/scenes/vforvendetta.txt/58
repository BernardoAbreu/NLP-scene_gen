<A>__{grunting like an animal, derek's face is frozen, locked in the rigor of a violent orgasm. after a moment, he collapses beside helen onto the sweat soaked sheets.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{there you go, baby. now my baby boy can think so much clearer. can't he?}
<A>__{she grabs her cigarette case and her lighter.}

<A>__{she straddles his chest then lights two cigarettes.}

<D>__{i know you have. ever since this terrorist appeared.}
<A>__{he smiles as she puts one of the cigarettes in his mouth.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh jesus, that smile. that smile turns me on like nothing else.}
<A>__{she whispers in his ear.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{tell me. tell me what's going on in that ruthless sadistic brain of yours.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{everyone is so worried about the terrorist. especially susan. you know why? because nobody knows what he's going to do.}
<A>__{he exhales through his grinding teeth.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{if i were him, i know what i'd do.}
<A>__{he whispers.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i'd blow that fat bastard to kingdom come.}

<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no. you're kidding.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{am i?}
<A>__{he smiles, blowing more smoke.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{there's an old train line under the new government building. it collapsed when they poured the foundation. you could haul in enough tnt to launch our leader's ass all the way to the moon.}
<A>__{helen's eyes gleam as he laughs.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you're serious, aren't you?}
<A>__{he eyes her sucking on the cigarette.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{you need to be careful, helen. your mouth is going to get you into trouble one day.}

<D>__{i know, derek. you love your country and you love your party, just like you love your wife.}
<A>__{he glares at her.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{derek. i'm sorry. i know i can be a bitch. but that's why you're here, isn't it?}
<A>__{he smiles again and she presses her body to his.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{this is it, isn't it, derek? what we've been waiting for. at last, you'll be rid of susan. i will be rid of conrad. and we'll be free. free, won't we?}
<A>__{his eyes close as he grinds his hips into hers and we rise, drifting up to the ceiling light fixture where we see a tiny hidden microphone.}
