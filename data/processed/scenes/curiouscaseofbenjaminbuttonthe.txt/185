<L>__{interior a new york loft night, 1947}
<A>__{a loft elevator opens depositing benjamin and daisy along with a bunch of people into a large loft... crowded with her friends, dancers and show people, musicians, predominantly young people, straight and gay, beatniks before there were beatniks, bohemians... music playing... people pressed together, having to shout to talk...}
<C>__{benjamin button's }
<D>__{and i met her friends...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{i will get you a drink...}
<A>__{as she turns to a kitchen to get him a drink, she is startled as a young man, david, suddenly grabs her, kissing her, a kiss that's not intended to be platonic... daisy obviously involved with him... but embarrassed by the intimacy in front of benjamin and not wanting to hurt his feelings... she pulls awkwardly away from him...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{this is my friend david... david dances with our company too... this is the man i've told you about, benjamin...}
<A>__{they shake hands... daisy, wanting to escape.}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{i will get you that drink. }
<A>__{...she goes into the kitchen...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you were her grandmother's friend or something like that...?}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{something like that.}
<A>__{and daisy comes back out with a drink for him... and one of her own... but before she can give him his drink, a woman takes it from her... and starts to dance with her... but not with her... the way dancers do... and many of the dancers are dancing just because they feel like it... david, comes to dance with daisy... benjamin standing watching daisy dancing with him... as only dancers can... in complete control of their bodies and yet totally uninhibited... benjamin sees david kiss her... and his jealousy getting the best of him, he turns and leaves...}
