<C>__{swat troops}
<D>__{do not move freeze motherfucker don't even twitch we will fire upon you let's see those hands }

<D>__{check this shit out.}
<A>__{nick turns, moves to garza's side. dunnigan joins them. all three staring at a wall. angle shifts around to reveal: the long ago photo (clipped from a newspaper) of nick and clarence darby shaking hands on the courthouse steps. angle widens to reveal: photo after photo. the crime scene photos...photos of clyde and his family in happier times...photos clipped from magazines and newspapers about the murder and trial...all very neatly and precisely arrayed. the entire wall covered with them. the music keeps booming from the record player. dunnigan turns tight to camera and yells:}

<D>__{your daughter is, what, ten now? that's a wonderful age. my daughter was always so busy at that age, so interested, so into everything. jumping around. i called her "bean," she jumped around so much.}

<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i am sorry, nick, that your daughter experienced that. you're right. that video should not have arrived that way. the person who sent it should have thought twice.}
