<A>__{tight on mike as he races through the trees. his legs trample over rocks, dirt, shrubs. then... mike trips, falls down hard. he lifts his forearm to reveal blood, scrapes and a long sharp splinter sticking out. the sight of it almost makes mike puke right then and there. mike grabs hold of the splinter, turns his head... takes about a thousand short quick breaths and... pulls the splinter out! blood squirts across his face. he removes the gray bandana from his back pocket, wraps it around his wound. mike lays back, stares up into the sky. tries to catch his breath, calm down. then... faint sound of laughter. mike sits up. again, faint sound of laughter. mike stands, takes a couple of steps toward the sound. more laughter. mike's got the scent, takes off in its direction.}
