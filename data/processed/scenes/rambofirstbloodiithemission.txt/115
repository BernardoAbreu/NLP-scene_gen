<A>__{rambo's group circles the ruins as they head for the landing zone. the trail skirts an escarpment which drops over a hundred feet to the ca river below. not far from the overgrown spires of the wat is a stream which breaks over the cliff in a graceful waterfall dropping unimpeded into a lagoon. the vista is quite stunning in the moonlight. brewer is struggling with both packs plus the heavy transat, since rambo has de fravio and co has her own pack. brewer scrambles, slipping back on the steep trail.}

<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{bury it here. work fast.}
<A>__{brewer gets out his entrenching tool. a cold pre dawn light suffuses the rain forest, giving it an expectant quality. rambo scans the ridgeline with brewer's scope. rambo's pov telephoto figures of twenty or more vietnamese soldiers can be seen threading among the trees.}
