<L>__{interior elevator day}
<A>__{corky glares at shelly and begins pumping the trigger of her circular saw. shelly hides behind his sunglasses, watching the elevator numbers go up. the doors open and he scurries out.}
<L>__{interior hall day}
<A>__{she watches him enter caesar's apartment, her smile now completely gone.}
<L>__{interior empty apartment day}
<A>__{it is later. through the wall we listen to the same sound as before of two people making love. we drop down and find corky's brush, still wet with paint, abandoned in her tray.}
<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{her face glistening with sweat, violet climaxes, letting the orgasm spread through her like melting butter.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i had this image of you, inside of me ...}
<A>__{she flattens her palms against the soft cradle of her pelvis.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{like a part of me ...}
<A>__{as she opens her eyes, we see that her lover is corky. violet watches as she gets off the bed and begins to get dressed.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you are so beautiful.}
<A>__{corky does not answer as she yanks her pants on. violet sits up. she can feel that something is wrong.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{violet pulls the sheet around her.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yes there is. i felt it this morning when i brought you the coffee.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{shit, here we go.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you didn't want to see me, did you?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{if there is one thing i can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what are you afraid of?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i'm not afraid of anything.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i don't understand ?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i know! you can't understand, because we're different, violet. we're different.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{we're not that different, corky.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{how can you sit in that bed and say that?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{because it's the truth.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{let me guess. this is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside. that inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh no, she's nothing like you. she's a lot smarter than you.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{is that what her daddy tells her?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i know what i am. i don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{what are you saying? that you don't have sex with men?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i don't.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{for christ's sake, violet! i heard you! thin walls, remember?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what you heard wasn't sex.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{what the fuck was it?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{all my life, everyone has been telling me that when i have sex, i'm not really having sex. not real sex. but they're wrong. i know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{what was it then?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{work.}
<A>__{that knocks corky back.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you made certain choices in your life that you paid for. you said you made them because you were good at something and it was easy. do you think you're the only one that's good at something?}
<A>__{violet stare pins corky to the wall.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{we make our own choices and we pay our own prices. i think we're more alike than you want to admit.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{what about that guy this morning?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you mean shelly?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{don't tell me, you're a workaholic.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{no. shelly knows what i am. he saw me in a bar with another woman.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i suppose he just wants to watch.}
<A>__{that's all violet can take.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{fuck it! i think you better leave.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i think so, too.}
<A>__{violet turns away.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{try not to steal anything on the way out.}
<A>__{that stings but corky walks out without looking back.}
