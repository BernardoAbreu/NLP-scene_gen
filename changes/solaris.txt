<LOC>__{EXT.  ROAD - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a vehicle through. The Man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle.  He is accompanied by a medium-sized LABRADOR, and seems in no particular hurry. The sound of tires appear and grow in intensity.  The Man, without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal. The dog obeys as the Man moves off the road.  The vehicle hurtles past him -- its engine quiet, its windows darkened -- spraying muddy debris in its wake. Seconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{THE MAN}
<ACTION>__{Stops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously still. The car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the Man, who remains motionless. When the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns transparent and we see a WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT in the rear seat.  His demeanor is pleasant and professional.}

<ACTION>__{The contrast between the cabin's rustic aesthetic and the aggressively high-tech equipment contained therein isn't as jarring as you might imagine. Kelvin is seated in front of a desk, scrolling through a text readout on a flat, transparent holographic screen.  Behind him is the Well-Dressed Bureaucrat from the car, and two others: A WOMAN in her 50s and a MAN in his 30s.  They are also well-groomed.  Each of their suits are embroidered with a small but distinctive LOGO of some sort that composes the acronym DBA. Kelvin scrolls through several menus, hits a few keys, and a digitized VIDEO IMAGE appears on his screen: A MAN, unshaven, looking into the camera. The man, GIBARIAN, looks very tired and somewhat apologetic. The lower part of the screen has a time of day and date display that reads: 0221 HRS 11/14/31.}

Snow and Sartorius show indications of depression, including dysthymic and bipolar I; a variety of stress disorders, including acute and posttraumatic; and suggestions of agoraphobia, obsessive/compulsive disorder, and hypersomnia.

It hasn't taken endless eons to adapt itself to its environment, but in fact dominated its environment immediately.  From the moment it existed, it was the most superior element in the Universe. And now it passes the time doing extravagant theoretical thinking about the Universe, with us as the cast.}

The fog turns into clouds and we get fleeting glimpses of the cabin, as we move farther and farther away. We stay in a translucent white stage for a few moments, until gradually the edges of a circle become apparent in the corners of the frame.  Still there is a light rain sound. These dark, rounded edges penetrate further until they are forming the shape of a circle. The misty consistency begins to gain some color and body. And we realize we are now looking at the surface of Solaris.}
