<A>__{lisa, her teeth clenched, moves forward and places the business end of the rifle against mixter's temple.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you shut the fuck about my mother, you don't know anything!!}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{i know that sometimes you wonder why you don't cry enough for her. i know you feel guilty for not doing more for her when she was alive. you feel guilty for moving on with your life and forgetting about her!!}

<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{face it lisa, you never cared for her. you never cared for anyone but yourself. she's looking up from the bowels of hell now knowing that you never loved her!}

<D>__{fuck you!!}
<A>__{lisa aims the rifle at mixter's face. suddenly the police burst in. lisa spins around, the rifle still in her hands. police open fire! her body is riddled with bullets and she falls to the floor in a blood soaked heap.}
