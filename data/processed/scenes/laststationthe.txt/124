<A>__{sofya looks out the window, sees the people lined up along the rail, mourn her loss. as she looks away, we see the people reflected in the glass, some of them kneel, some of them remove their hats. valentin watches the train pull away. he holds masha to him. as the train moves slowly through the corridor of mourners, some of them fall in and walk behind it. the camera travels up and up as the train travels north taking sofya and her husband back to yasnaya polyana.}
