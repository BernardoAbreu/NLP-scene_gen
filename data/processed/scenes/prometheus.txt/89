<L>__{exterior magellan airlock lift dusk}
<A>__{david bareheaded in the winds walks watts and holloway onto the airlock. david looks over his shoulder at the canal leading back to the central crater. as the airlock lift begins to rise, he steps backward out into the storm. turns and runs through the gale toward the pyramid. watts watches him go in astonishment.}
<L>__{interior magellan excursion chamber}
<A>__{watts helps holloway out of his space suit. janek looks on.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{i didn't think i'd see you again. you know we lost two men.}
<A>__{holloway still looks too weary to think straight. he nods.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{she told me. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{he stands abruptly, swaying a little.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{i need to lie down. we'll size things up in the morning. fair enough?}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{passageway}
<A>__{holloway and watts walk aft toward their cabin. watts looks worried but holloway shows little of the weakness he just claimed to feel.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<C>__{holloway}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{not here.}
<A>__{scientists' cabin washroom night holloway stands shirtless in the tiny space, brushing his teeth. a red weal around his neck. watts stands beside him, watching him in the mirror.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{jocelyn. i saw something. god, my mouth tastes like an old boot.}
<A>__{he spits. rinses. she touches the mark on his neck.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{neck ring of my suit, i think. fell on it.}
<A>__{he rubs his neck, eyes far away. watts watches him curiously.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{what did you see?}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{after my fall, i woke up walking. delirious. my helmet wasn't right. i took it off. i was in and out. i just wandered. i went up into a huge space like a cathedral. and i found a model of the galaxy. floating in the air.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{are you okay? you sound...}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{this was real. my headset video is wherever my helmet is...but my suit tracker will show where i was.}
<A>__{he turns to her.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{listen. this star map had a marker representing earth. very clear. another marker i'm sure represents this moon. but there were others. at least seven or eight more.}
<A>__{watts stares at him, her eyes coming alight.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{the engineers aren't from here. this moon's just an outpost. abandoned. but if we follow that map, we may yet make contact with a living civilization.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{martin.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{the location of the engineer worlds is the real prize. next to that, weyland's terraforming is chump change. we need to get coordinates. and keep them from the company. we have to play this smart.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{two men dead...vickers is jumpy. as soon as she gets what she wants, she'll take this ship home. we have to move fast.}
<A>__{holloway trembles. a sheen of sweat on his skin.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{we will. you all right?}
<A>__{he's frightened. brazens through it. pulls her into his arms.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{i'm fine, now.}
<A>__{he kisses her.}
<C>__{bedroom}
<A>__{holloway tumbles watts onto the bed. pulls her shirt off. they struggle out of their clothes, clinging to one another. holloway's ill at ease: something's wrong inside him, he feels it. he dives into watts as if for refuge. they make love. sitting atop holloway, watts lays a hand on his chest.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{your heart's beating so hard.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{that's your fault.}
<A>__{vulnerability in his voice. fear under the surface. he rolls on top of her. drives her into the mattress. she holds him protectively: not deceived by his bravado. suddenly holloway tenses, muscles rigid. shuddering. watts draws breath through her teeth with a hiss. eyes open. her fingers rake his back. he screams. horribly. eyes bulging. tendons standing out of his throat. watts jumps violently underneath him.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{martin! martin!}
<A>__{he begins to convulse. she rolls him onto the bed beside her, trying to contain his spasms. his teeth grind.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{martin!}
<A>__{a horrible crack. in the middle of holloway's chest, beneath the sternum, a grotesque head pushes out through the skin. a parasite. blood fountains from the ruinous wound. holloway goes into a massive seizure. violently lashing out. watts stares at the parasite fighting its way out of his body. it is white and boneless. glistening. it flails its hideous lunging jaw. watts screams and screams. the parasite frees itself from its savage womb and turns on watts. she slaps at it blindly. it hisses at her. she squirms away across the floor, tangled in the bloody sheet. the thing comes after her. corridor tracking shot watts's screams echo through the magellan. stillwell runs down the hallway, searching for the source.}
<C>__{scientists' cabin}
<A>__{the parasite chases watts across the floor. she leaps into the clothes locker and slams the steel door. the parasite flattens itself. slick as an octopus, it begins to slide under the locker door. watts shrieks in horror. stillwell bursts into the cabin, janek right behind him. quick as a cat, the parasite darts to a floor vent and slithers bonelessly between the bars. watts bursts out of the locker, naked and bloodied. rushes to holloway where he lies on the gory mattress, a horrific hole in his chest. he is beyond all help.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{martin. martin!}
<A>__{janek and stillwell struggle to take in what they're seeing. stillwell pulls holloway's jacket off a chair. wraps it around watts. pulls her gently away from the bed. she looks at him, uncomprehending. shock setting in.}
<C>__{break room}
<A>__{watts sits at a steel table, deep in shock. she wears an oversized crew coverall: her skin still streaked with dried blood under the fabric. a knot of crewmen around her. janek, stillwell, brick, glasse and downs. janek looks at glasse.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{take care of her. get her a sedative. downs. get holloway into a freezer. everybody else with me.}
