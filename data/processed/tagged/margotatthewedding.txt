<L>__{interior train car day}
<A>__{a cashier hands a boy, 13, his change across a counter. the boy stuffs the coins in his pocket. he lifts the cardboard tray with two hot dogs, a bag of chips, and two cokes. this is claude. we follow him: he carefully carries the meal down the aisle, balances it in one hand as he opens the door. the train noise blares as he traverses the area between cars. he enters the new car repeating the balancing act. he waits while a man shoves his back pack onto the metal rack above the seats. claude hurries a bit more now, his concentration alternating between the food and the path. he sits next to a brunette woman. he hands her a hot dog.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{he's met by a severe and pinched face. the eyes have black circles there is a scar above her lip. claude instantly blushes and mumbles:}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{he gets up and hurries a few seats further. he slides next to a pretty brunette woman, late 30's, with straight shoulder length hair. her name is margot.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{that was quick.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i sat next to the wrong person.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{really? where?}
<A>__{she stretches up and peers over the seats. he grabs her shirt.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{please don't look. she'll see you.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{careful with my blouse.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{margot is sleeping, her head against the window. claude listens to his ipod. he takes out the earphones, gets up, and walks to the front of the car. opens the door and goes between cars. the train roars and screeches. claude screams. he stops, looks around. he screams again.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{claude and his mother gaze out the dirt streaked window at a river. an old castle like structure emerges from the water. houses are run down. in the distance there's a power plant. electrical lines crisscross the sky. claude puts his finger against the glass and traces the wires.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{will the wedding be crowded?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i don't know. i think she doesn't know anyone anymore.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{how long has she known malcolm?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{only a year.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{is that short?}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{would you marry someone you'd only known a year?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i'm not going to ever get married.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i can't say i have a lot of hope for the whole thing.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{why are we going then?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{we're supporting her.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i thought she wasn't speaking to you.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{no...no...i wasn't speaking to her, but i'm over it.}
<L>__{exterior ferry dock day}
<A>__{a ferry is docked. cars pull up onto the boat. margot runs, clutching a suitcase, holding down a floppy wine colored sun hat. claude hurries alongside her, a bag slung over his shoulder.}
<L>__{exterior ferry day}
<A>__{the rumbling and sputtering of the boat. people get out of their cars and stretch their legs. claude leans against the rail and lets the spray hit his face. margot's cell vibrates. the caller id: home. she stuffs the phone in her pocket.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{why aren't you wearing your new shades?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i don't think i need them right now.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you begged for those glasses.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i know, but...i will wear them, i just feel like people might think it's weird that a kid is wearing dark shades.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{that's ridiculous.}
<A>__{claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap around punk sunglasses and puts them on. he looks around self consciously.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you look very cool.}
<A>__{he takes them off.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i don't need them right now.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{margot and claude wait. the ferry has emptied out.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{do they know we're here?}
<A>__{a maroon volvo station wagon peels around a bend and stops across the road. two eyes peer out from just below the backseat window. a man, 40, in dumpy cargo shorts rolls down the window. he has a small moustache he's harried and sweaty. this is malcolm. he points at margot and claude.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{are you...?}
<L>__{interior volvo day}
<A>__{malcolm drives. he smokes with the window open. margot is in the passenger seat. in the back, claude and the girl, ingrid, sit shyly, their hair blows turbulently in the wind. ingrid, 11, wears shorts, sandals, and a batik shirt with a panda on it.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{paul apologizes for not coming, she's still getting the house ready.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i'm sorry it was such short notice.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i don't care. paul's frantic, but i don't give a shit. oh, and ingrid wants me to tell you that she made us all bracelets.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{no, i wanted...i wanted to wait...}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{oh, i thought you asked me to tell them. anyway...}
<A>__{malcolm holds up his wrist and shows a knit blue and orange bracelet.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i got knicks colors.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{they're not knicks colors!}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{it's beautiful, ingrid.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<P>__{(to claude)}
<D>__{i made this one for myself.}
<A>__{she shows him the purple and green one around her wrist.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{yours is yellow. is that okay?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{where's your dad and josh?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{they might come later.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{josh's spring break is next week. jim teaches through friday and then they open the house in vermont on the weekend.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(bluntly)}
<D>__{it means a lot to pauline that you're here.}
<A>__{margot nods awkwardly she blushes.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{oh. good.}
<A>__{a car suddenly pulls out of a driveway, but nowhere near their car. malcolm swerves anyway.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{holy jesus! watch it, dicksack!}
<A>__{ingrid giggles. margot clutches the handle above the door.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{if you're wondering about the moustache }
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{no, i wasn't.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i had a full beard for a while and then when i shaved it i left this part for last, you know to see how it looked, and... it's meant to be funny.}
<A>__{margot nods politely. the sound of tires on gravel:}
<L>__{exterior house day}
<A>__{the trunk slams shut. the volvo is parked in a driveway alongside a grey colonial house that sits above the water. they lift bags. an old mutt ambles toward them. pauline emerges from the house. she's pretty like her sister, late 30's. she walks briskly toward them. margot smiles and opens her arms, but pauline passes her and dips down to embrace claude. she kisses him on the lips.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you're so handsome.}
<A>__{now she hugs margot. they both tear up. claude beams.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i never thought i'd get you here.}
<A>__{a loud thud. they all turn toward the property fence. a large pile of dead flowers and rotting plants has been dumped into their yard. there's whispering and movement through brush on the other side. margot looks at pauline with concern.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you're arriving in the midst of a drama. ingrid, make sure wizard is inside.}
<A>__{malcolm trudges over to the trash cans.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{it's the voglers.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{the neighbors want us to cut down our tree.}
<A>__{she indicates a large oak that extends up and into the adjoining property.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{no, that's our tree!}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{they think it's sick and rotting their property.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{we're having the ceremony under it.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you took the swing down.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{pauline thinks this is their way of trying to be friends. i think they resent us because we're...}
<A>__{he searches for the word, but can't come up with anything. he says wearily:}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i don't know what we are.}
<L>__{interior claude's guest room ingrid's room day}
<A>__{claude sits on the squeaky bed, a yellow bracelet on his wrist. an old flip clock hums on the night table. a door opens onto a bathroom which has another door open onto another bedroom. ingrid sits on her bed observing claude. she holds a realistic looking stuffed rooster in an old style tuxedo.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{this is my room.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{do you like showers or baths?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{showers. what about you?}
<A>__{ingrid shrugs. she says, already bored with the topic:}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<L>__{interior stairwell margot's guest room day}
<A>__{pauline and margot carry bags up the stairs. margot now wears a knit red bracelet. they're tentative with one another.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{is malcolm what you thought he'd be?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{well, i didn't know what to }
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{the moustache is temporary. he left it for last when he was shaving. it's meant to be funny.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{he told me.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{they enter the guest room. the windows are wide open, the curtains blowing, but the room is very neatly made up.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i'm sorry with so little time to prepare, we had to put you in malcolm's storage room }
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{this was becky's room. poor becky.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{yeah, poor becky. now it's a storage room. i've just started to feel like it's our house not my parents. you know?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{our parents.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{of course. it might still smell like paint, but...}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i thought he was a musician.}
<A>__{pauline jimmies down the stiff windows. margot begins to unpack and hang up clothes in the closet.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{well, music's officially a hobby... he's painting now. and writing letters to newspapers and magazines. he's very meticulous, he'll spend up to a week writing a response to a music review. he's incredibly smart. maybe too smart. i don't know. we're doing very well.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{good. i mean, you must be.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i don't know where to begin. what can i tell you? it seems i'm pregnant, but it's really early so... i haven't told anyone. i mean, i haven't told malcolm or ingrid.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{wow...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{yeah, if it sticks. we'll see. i hope so. things are good. we did a couples seminar two months ago or so in maine. they give you exercises and things to do. i know you're not convinced, but...}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(vaguely)}
<D>__{mm hm.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{we got engaged right afterwards. the guy who runs it, strickland, wrote a really interesting book about loving which i will lend you if you want.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(non committal)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{but only if you'll read it. because i need it back. i made notes in the margins.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i may not get to it for a while.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{well, i'm not going to lend it to you if you're not going to read it.}
<A>__{they meet eyes. pauline quickly turns away.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{it's going to be very informal by the way. just mom and becky. malcolm's brother. few friends. and now you and claude. nothing like the first one.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(wary)}
<D>__{becky's coming? pauline margot she isn't how you... i'd really like...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you go.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i was going to say, "i'd really like some white wine."}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{oh. yeah. we have a... well...i'm glad you changed your mind and came. i never heard from you after i sent the invite...i even wondered if you got it.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{well, i'm so pleased we're here.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{did you get it?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{pauline waits for an explanation.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i'm sorry you were so angry...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i wasn't angry. i was...disappointed.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{uh huh. but you see when you say, "disappointed" it puts me in a crummy situation. like i let you down.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{but you did in a way.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i don't see it like that.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{fine. i felt betrayed. is that word okay?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{again, you're making me the aggressor.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you were the aggressor.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{let's not... i've become a really good cook.}
<L>__{interior living room late day}
<A>__{malcolm strums his guitar and smokes. pauline sits at his feet with ingrid and claude. the kids look at a record sleeve. margot is curled up on the sofa writing in a little brown notebook. she wears oval tortoise shell glasses.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i can't believe you've still got all of our old records.}
<A>__{ingrid pulls an album toward her. her eyes widen at the scary image on the cover. she quickly turns it over and hands it to her mother.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{mom, can you hide this please.}
<A>__{pauline puts the record sleeve on top of a shelf.}
<C>__{pauline}
<P>__{(for margot's benefit)}
<D>__{malcolm played with ric ocasek once?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{in the late `80's. it was a solo gig after he left the cars.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{so, you're kind of famous.}
<A>__{malcolm reddens.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{no. no. believe me, i'm not. i used to want to be, but, no. do you want to be famous?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{claude wants to be very famous.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{well, make sure you can handle rejection. i can't. for me, expectation just turns to disappointment. so, ultimately i'd rather not try. it'll all go black for us soon enough anyway.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{claude, ignore him.}
<A>__{pauline sneaks a look at margot who is watching malcolm with an expression of either contempt or confusion. pauline grows uncomfortable. she says to claude:}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{when your mother moved to new york she used to send me books and records. she sent me rem's murmur...}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{and the pixies.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{and x. she was very cool your mother.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you only liked top forty.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{yeah, but i love rem now.}
<A>__{margot takes off her reading glasses and rubs her eyes.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i don't really listen to music anymore.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i was dating that guy, horace back then. remember him?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{was that the guy who liked to rough you up?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{no, that was our dad.}
<A>__{pauline and margot crack up laughing. malcolm raises an eyebrow at claude.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{our father used to strip down to his skivvies and beat us with a belt.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{that man had a sexual screw loose.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{it's awful that stuff that happens to kids. malcolm was fondled by a male baby sitter.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{just use that information however you want...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{sorry. we're with family. i figured...}
<A>__{claude looks at malcolm. malcolm doesn't meet his eyes.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i think becky got it the worst.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{did she ever. raped by the horse trainer...}
<A>__{margot breaks into laughter. pauline spits her seltzer back into the glass. they both laugh hysterically. tears stream down margot's face. claude watches.}
<L>__{exterior patio night}
<A>__{malcolm, pauline, margot, claude and ingrid sit with a homosexual couple, alan, 40's, and toby, 30's, and their son, bruce, 8, at an old wooden table eating crab, salad and soup. part of alan's face is paralyzed.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{alan rolled over in bed and looked at me and he said i can't feel my face. it took three doctors before we knew it was bells palsy.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{they say a brush of wind can do it.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{feeling is slowly coming back.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{we're all getting older... which is terrible i don't care how universal it is. i can't remember names anymore.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i have that. i blank out on certain words now too. like the other day, i couldn't remember the word for...}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i've forgotten it again. the stuff in wine. sediment! that was it.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i know that. i was talking more about not remembering who was the bassist for motley crue.}
<A>__{malcolm lights up a cigarette. he offers one to claude who shakes his head, no.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{ingrid, why don't you show claude and bruce the game trunk.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{claude reluctantly follows ingrid and bruce. he looks back longingly at the table of adults.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(relieved, to himself)}
<D>__{mick mars.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{toby, i think you need to have bruce diagnosed.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{margot, i don't want to have this conversation with you.}
<A>__{we follow the kids inside. we hear in the background:}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{it's vital. if you keep telling him he's like everyone else he'll wonder why he isn't. he's suffering.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{he's tested very well. he does b's in school.}
<A>__{claude stops his mother and toby are arguing out the window. her eyes meet his for a second they make no connection she goes back to toby.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{but, that's how autism works. one part of the brain can work fine while the other is damaged.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{we had him diagnosed, margot. nothing was found wrong.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{did you really, though?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i'm...i'm not going to have this conversation. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i know it must be so difficult for you, but i think you have to }
<L>__{interior kitchen same}
<A>__{pauline unloads the plates onto the kitchen counter. she hesitates and exhales a deep, anxious breath.}
<L>__{exterior house night}
<A>__{margot paces while talking on a cell phone in the herb garden. she drinks a white wine with ice cubes and smokes a jointerior the bottle lies at her feet, three quarters empty.}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i left you a note.}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{come back. or meet me in vermont on saturday.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{no...no. the wedding is on saturday. i'm here for that. i can't really pull out. how would that look?}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{you haven't spoken to her in years }
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{well, we're speaking now. she is my closest friend despite it all... you're the one who's been trying to get me to call her.}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{did you tell claude what you're doing?}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(suddenly laughing)}
<D>__{jim, this guy, malcolm. he's exactly what you'd imagine except i think he's clinically depressed.}
<C>__{margot }
<D>__{not ugly, but completely unattractive. and he has no job. the best i can make out is that he's a letter writer. i don't know, the house looks weird to me...she's trying too hard and it's kind of a mess...they took down the swing...}
<A>__{silence on the other end.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{you said you weren't a hundred percent on this. you said that like a week ago. can i come up there?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{no. i don't want to see you i feel happier already having done it.}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{really? you feel happier...}
<P>__{(silence)}
<D>__{please don't tell claude anything please, until we've talked more.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i need to tell him. and we need to tell josh. did he do his homework?}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{this is happening and you have to get your mind around that.}
<L>__{interior claude's guest room night}
<A>__{claude sleeps in bed. margot gently touches his face. she whispers:}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{are you asleep?}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{will you remember this?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i just talked to your dad...}
<A>__{claude's eyes remained closed, but he smiles.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i'm only going to tell you if you won't remember.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{margot hesitates. she changes her mind and says thoughtfully:}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{everyone finds you so funny and charming. i always get compliments about you.}
<A>__{margot stands. she catches herself in a warped mirror and smears some eye make up off of her face.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{are you having fun? is it nice to see pauline?}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(opens his eyes)}
<D>__{yeah, i really like her.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{yeah. she is crazy though.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{in what way?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{she's really berserk. maybe it's hormones. you don't notice anything different about pauline?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{she's pregnant she told me. but she's keeping it a secret i mean from malcolm and even ingrid. which i think is unforgiveable. now she'll have to marry him. what's she planning to get married and not drink champagne? then she'll just be lying. i guess she's afraid she'll miscarry. she probably will. i think on some level she's ambivalent about the marriage and that's why she's not telling him.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{are you stoned, mom?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{maybe a little.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i don't like it.}
<L>__{interior malcolm and pauline's room night}
<A>__{water runs from the bathroom. malcolm cradles a glass of whiskey and stands nude in front of a full length mirror.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{my scrotum is longer than my penis.}
<A>__{he turns around and looks at his ass. pauline walks out of the bathroom. she wears mens pajamas, the top open.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it's sweet how claude looks up to me.}
<A>__{he waits for a reaction and gets none.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{margot doesn't seem as crazy as you made her out to be.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{what she did to toby and alan tonight didn't seem crazy enough for you?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i guess that seemed pretty crazy.}

<D>__{kind of. we're neighbors. we employ maisy. i mean i don't care, i just think it's interesting.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{are you excited about the talk? i thought i'd come if that's okay. my friend, agnes, asked me, "what's it like to have a celebrity as a sister?" i said, i've got no problem with celebrity. alice munro taught at bennington and was kind of a friend of mine.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i'm not a celebrity.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{well, you're well known.}

<D>__{i guess i didn't realize it was a compliment.}
<L>__{exterior forest late day}
<A>__{margot walks the path alone. she hugs herself as a light breeze kicks up. her footsteps echo in the trees. the little pink sneaker still lies in the dirt. she crouches down and takes it.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{close: a note is being written. "...and if you are acting with any sort of abuse toward your child i will call the police." the word "any" is then underlined twice. the page is torn from her little brown book.}
<L>__{exterior vogler house evening}
<A>__{margot's fist is raised about to knock on the front door. she stops herself. she puts the note on the welcome mat and holds it in place with the child's shoe. she wanders around to the back of the house. she looks into a lighted window: it's a white tiled bathroom. a wet brown animal body covered in clear plastic is balanced on the sink. mr. vogler tears into the plastic. the carcass is butterflied open exposing the innards and ribs. mrs. vogler runs the tub. she pours salt from a box in the water. the man slides his hand in her waist band. she rubs against him. margot chews her cuticle. the man saws the legs. his arm jerks back and forth, straining to cut through the bone. sweat pours down his temples. margot raises her hand to her face and presses against the window. she peers through her fingers. the blade pierces the bone with a violent release and the hoof falls to the floor. margot moves to another window. the pig's face now looks at her. blood drips and leaks into the crevices of the tile. the woman brandishes a syringe filled with an orange liquid. suddenly a face appears in the glass. margot leaps back. it's a thin boy. he says something. the family turns to the window. the father flicks off the bathroom light. from inside margot illuminates like an apparition. margot scampers into the trees. she pushes through branches, her shirt tears. she runs.}
<L>__{interior claude's guest room evening}
<A>__{claude sits on the bed. the record sleeve from blondie's "parallel lines" rests in his lap. he reads the lyrics to the song, "sunday girl." he depresses the red record button on an old portable tape recorder. he sings a cappella and full voice, passionately, as sweetly as he can. maisy appears in the doorway and watches. claude turns mid lyric. he jumps, startled.}
<C>__{maisy}
<D>__{singing?}
<A>__{fumbling, claude shuts off the tape recorder.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{hm? a bit.}
<A>__{she drifts into the room and hovers closely above claude who remains on the bed. margot passes by in the hallway, disheveled from her escape. she watches: maisy takes the lyric sleeve from claude's hands. her t shirt hangs above her waist showing her smooth stomach.}

<D>__{can i make a suggestion?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{maisy}

<C>__{margot}
<D>__{it causes cancer.}

<D>__{underarm deodorant?}

<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i'm not going to die from underarm cancer.}

<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i hope you're not interested in that girl. i find her insufferable.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{it means i can't suffer her. she's loud and stupid. she goes on about things of which she knows nothing about.}

<D>__{she got into harvard early.}

<C>__{ingrid}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{my mom thinks your mom is unreliable.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{who cares.}
<A>__{but he does. claude bites into his burger. his eyes fix on the crease between maisy's breasts. maisy says to claude:}

<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{maisy}

<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{is it scary?}
<L>__{exterior field night}
<A>__{the three kids lie in the grass and watch through the slats in the fence: the vogler family eats at an outdoor table. a pig turns on a spit over a smoky barbecue. mrs. vogler says something and the kids and mr. vogler laugh. maisy climbs over claude to see better. he feels her breasts press against his back. suddenly he swats crazily at his ear. ingrid is poking him with a blade of grass.}

<A>__{malcolm drives quickly with pauline next to him. he's smoking with the window open, dick and margot in the backseat.}

<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(to dick)}
<D>__{my license elapsed. but i know how.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it's probably for the best. i have this theory, i think, historically, women have been held back in so many ways that when they get power, like they do behind the wheel, they can't help but abuse it. it's akin to hannah arendt's eichmann theory about prison guards and prisoners switching rolls.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{that's a charming philosophy.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{yeah. tell that one a lot.}

<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you should go after her.}

<D>__{i just want to keep it.}
<C>__{ingrid}

<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{because it's pointless...}
<A>__{claude hears footsteps creak downstairs. he goes to the door and peers out: pauline and malcolm, a little disheveled and dirty, climb the stairs. neither speaks. malcolm goes into the hall bathroom. pauline into their room. running water groans through the old pipes.}

<D>__{where are you going? i thought we were having a conversation.}

<L>__{interior margot's room continuous}
<A>__{claude enters. it's empty. her brown notebook rests on the bedside table. he hesitates then opens it: it's packed with writing a nearly indecipherable cursive in black ink. the name claude can be made out on the page. claude takes the book and climbs up into bed. he nestles against the pillow and squints to read the writing.}
<C>__{margot }
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{claude startles. margot stands in the doorway with a glass of water.}

<D>__{we can put a pillow between us.}

<A>__{malcolm, his moustache gone, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, hammers in a stake at the base of a collapsed, white tent. a workman holds a pole steadily. pauline sets up chairs around a series of tables. ingrid idles a few feet away. they're in the midst of talking:}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{why was it a secret?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{because i didn't want to get you excited before it was real. it's not really a baby yet. in two more weeks we can celebrate together, okay?}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{why did you tell margot?}
<C>__{pauline}

<D>__{nobody fills the ice cube trays.}
<A>__{malcolm stops, immediately embarrassed. margot is looking in the freezer. she takes out the trays and brings them to the sink. she runs the water.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{sorry, what were you }
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{nothing. it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{no, what were you saying?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it really... nothing.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{she treads back to the refrigerator, balancing the full trays.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i was saying i'm doing these abstractions in acrylic painterior but it's not... i'm not getting paid or anything. i don't know, i hate that question, "what do you do?"}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you asked me.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i know, but...}
<A>__{malcolm exhales in frustration.}
<L>__{exterior field day}
<A>__{pauline and malcolm open the gate to the vogler's property.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i think we shouldn't mention the tree, we should let them know that there will be people and music on saturday and it will be louder than usual.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{and that they can come for a glass of champagne. but you tell them. i think they respond to you better.}
<A>__{they approach the vogler's sun worn and paint chipped house.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{well, i am ultimately one of them. you shouldn't've made me shave the stache.}
<C>__{pauline}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{yeah, right.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{oh, hey, ingrid is asking me if i was ever gay. do you know what that's about?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{mr. vogler, wearing a fleece vest and carrying a hatchet over his shoulders, tramples out of the brush.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{vogler stops. his face is jagged and worn.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{hi, i'm pauline. this is malcolm. we've met before. we're your neighbors.}
<A>__{the man watches them strangely with icy blue eyes.}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{you gonna cut that tree down?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{well, we grew up with that tree and we're getting married under it saturday and }
<A>__{she waits for malcolm to jump in. he doesn't. vogler says softly, but sternly:}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{the roots are growing into our property. it's rotting, it's killing our plants.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{we had a tree doctor out and he said it was healthy.}
<A>__{pauline smacks malcolm's arm.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{would it hurt you to say anything?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what? what do you want from me?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you're making me do the whole fucking thing.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you brought up the tree.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{he brought up }
<A>__{she stops herself. she says to vogler:}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i'm sorry... this was better thought through back at the house.}
<A>__{pauline's gaze goes above vogler's head like margot described earlier. he runs his hand through his hair as if something might be caught in there.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{we were wondering if you and your wife i'm sorry i forgot her name would like to come over for...}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{you should ask her. she makes the plans. i'm going to go in now.}
<A>__{he tramps inside. the screen door bangs.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i felt like you didn't give me a chance to say what i wanted to say.}
<A>__{pauline hits him in the chest and starts to walk away. malcolm comes after her, his rage growing.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i want to punch that guy in the nose!}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you've never hit anyone.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i have too!}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{lots of you don't know them. they're not around because i've punched them.}
<A>__{a smile breaks across pauline's face. malcolm seethes.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{don't laugh, pauline. it's not funny. i will fucking punch your sister.}
<A>__{malcolm clenches his fists. he points at vogler's place.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{the threat is not out there. it's in our house. it's sleeping in my studio. i mean, i wouldn't actually hit her, but i feel...i feel like doing it. she's such a fucking idiot.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{she's not an idiot. you might not like her }
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{she is. she is an idiot! you're an idiot.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you're both fucking morons. i'm so fucking... i'm trying so hard. you don't give me any credit.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{what is wrong?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i don't know, i have the emotional version of whatever bad feng shui would be. i don't know. you tell me, you understand this shit.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{did you drink your teas?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{yeah, i drank my fucking teas! don't judge me now. really, i think when you look back at this you're going to see i'm not acting like a crazy person. that this is the right reaction. in proportion with what is going on. this is right!}
<A>__{malcolm looks around furiously. the only thing available to him is a leafy stalk. he pulls on it, but it won't uproot. he tears the leaves off in a rage.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you have the most oddly self conscious form of rage i've ever }
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i hate you.}
<A>__{exhausted he approaches her. he says, still with anger:}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{let's make love.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{pauline walks back to the house, buttoning her dress. she looks up suddenly and stops: a man watches her from the lawn. he holds a bouquet of flowers. pauline runs to him.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{jim...}
<A>__{they embrace. her hand cups the back of his neck.}
<C>__{claude }
<D>__{dad!}
<A>__{claude runs from the house.}
<L>__{exterior patio late day}
<A>__{pauline, malcolm, margot, jim, claude and ingrid eat fish stew and peasant bread. jim's flowers sit in a vase. he wears a tan knit bracelet that ingrid made.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it was a difficult decision because claude has so many friends at school now, but it is expensive and bronx science is a great public school.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i didn't get into stuyvesant.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{he's not a good test taker.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i went to stuy.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(caught off guard)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i'd rather stay at packer, but it's so expensive.}
<A>__{malcolm lifts up a bottle of jameson from the floor near his chair and pours himself another stiff drink.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{josh is a great test taker, but claude thinks more abstractly. he's more creative. right?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i guess so.}
<A>__{jim smiles warmly at his son.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i saw the one armed man who really has two arms at the bodega.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{did you give him confusing change?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i did. i tripped him up with some nickels. and a canadian quarter.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you know what i tried the other day? sitting down to pee. have you done this, jim?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no...no.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i did it as a lark. as a joke really. i was going to call pauline in and say, guess what i'm doing here...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i'm sorry i didn't get to have that experience.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i was thinking, you know, my dad used to say, "why stand when you can sit." and this is a really good example of that. i mean, it took me so long to try because i was embarrassed.}
<P>__{(to the sisters)}
<D>__{you guys do it all the time.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i never sit down in a public place. i squat and hover.}
<A>__{ingrid goes wide eyed for a moment.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{anyway, i recommend it. at least to try it.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{jim, i'm sorry about the room. it's usually malcolm's storage room so it's kind of make shift right now.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it's fine.}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{margot, open your gift.}

<D>__{i get self conscious opening presents in front of people. this weekend is about pauline.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{oh...poo. open it margot.}
<A>__{margot slowly unties the white ribbon and peels away the tape. pauline groans:}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{come on, get to it.}
<A>__{margot takes out a pair of furry slippers.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{those look warm.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i remember last year in vermont you said your feet were freezing.}
<A>__{her eyes find claude who watches his parents carefully. she leans across the table to jim and they kiss chastely and briskly on the lips.}

<C>__{margot}
<D>__{it makes me sad to get a present that i already have.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{it makes me feel like you don't know me.}
<A>__{she jams her pinky into her ear trying to get at the bug.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what's wrong with your ear?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i asked you not to come. i was so clear and you did it anyway so blithely.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{we need time alone to sort this out. you can't just run away }
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{okay, so we're here. i'm giving you this time.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(trying a joke)}
<D>__{well, now you're putting too much pressure on me.}

<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{his headlights catch a woman cowering at the roadside. they pass.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{keep driving.}

<D>__{she didn't have her purse with her. it wasn't so expensive. roger's going to live.}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{of course you would've.}

<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you're just like claude in that way...you make me feel guilty. sometimes i find you so despicable.}

<C>__{margot}
<D>__{if it were someone else i'd understand it, i'd feel sympathy even. but since it's me, i just feel bad. and horribly critical. i haven't been able to tell claude what's happening. and i have to. i'm going to.}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{how can i be all these people? how can i be married to jim. and fuck dick. and want them both and then neither of them...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i know. we're at the age where we're becoming invisible to men and if a guy wants to fuck us, it's very tempting.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i'm saying, if you get your sense of self from being fuckable and that starts to wane it's very hard. i almost had an affair too. but you know, you don't have to do it. you can, i don't know, get a manicure or something.}
<A>__{margot grows furious. she turns to hide her face.}
<C>__{pauline}

<C>__{pauline}

<D>__{yeah, i think so.}

<P>__{(suddenly)}

<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{who should i be with then?}
<A>__{a smashing sound. margot steps outside: two hooded figures turn over a recycling can, glass smashes on the ground. garbage is strewn across the driveway.}

<D>__{hey! hey, you! you pick that up. i will call the police. this is our property. pick that up.}

<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{okay.}

<P>__{(under her breath)}

<P>__{(flips through pages)}
<D>__{yeah, it's in here. i mean we were talking almost every day at this point and there was no warning. maybe a couple of remarks that she'd used some things of ours... then the new yorker comes we have a subscription and there's the story and... it's things we said and did stuff i told her in confidence.}
<C>__{pauline }

<C>__{dick}
<D>__{the father is a loathsome character yet we also feel a strange sympathy for him.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{yeah, well i was very interested in exploring a father daughter relationship. while he clings desperately to her, suffocates her really, he also silently resents the responsibility of parenthood.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{there's this sexualized push pull with daphne which i find }
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{he craves isolation really. i always thought of him as someone who so over identifies with everyone around him that he begins to lose all sense of himself.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{you make his only recourse to abandon his family, including his beloved daughter.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{right, that's true. that's true.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i write historical fiction so i don't have to answer to this, but i wonder for someone who writes so nakedly about family, how autobiographical is this portrait?}
