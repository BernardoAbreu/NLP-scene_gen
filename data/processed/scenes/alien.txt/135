<L>__{interior bridge}
<A>__{the screens are showing them a schematic of the ship's system of ventilator shafts.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{that one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets you notice? the food storage room on one end }
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{ and the cooling unit on the other.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{so it's trapped in between now we have to drive it out.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{poison gas...}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{we can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit! it'll flood the whole ship!}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{the only other thing i can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{are you crazy ?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{the man would need protection, obviously as well as some way to drive the thing before him.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{how about a flamethrower? that wouldn't poison the air.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{so one of us goes into the airshaft and drives the thing along }
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{while the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{sounds like a rough one.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{got a better idea?}
<A>__{hunter shrugs.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{so the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{let's be democratic.}
<A>__{he tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console. on one of them, he draws a large x. then he wads each piece of paper into a tiny little ball. he rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the table like dice.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{martin, take one.}
<A>__{roby picks one up and unfolds it. it is blank. melkonis picks up another and opens it. again blank. faust picks up a ball, and standard immediately picks his own up. they are both blank. they all look at hunter, who has not yet unfolded his.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{open it up, cleave.}
