<L>__{exterior mars surface day}
<A>__{they're all exhausted and a little punchy.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{how long can a man go without food or water?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{how long can you go without singing that dumb song?}
<A>__{burchenal looks hurt. walks another few paces. begins to sing again. gallagher turns to pettengill.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{there's two of us. and we can stop him from singing.}
<A>__{pettengill considers. then sings along instead. they only know the one line. it's really annoying.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{i have no idea. it's old, though. it's classic music.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i don't know the classics.}
<A>__{this sets burchenal off. he sings some more }
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{mars ain't a place to raise your kids}
<A>__{in fact it's cold as hell and there's no one there to raise them if you dig.'}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{what the hell is that?}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{you don't know any of the classics, do you? he was a rocket man.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{an astronaut wrote that?}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{never mind.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{sing the one about the dogs again.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{it's about cows.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{then why does it say doggies?}
<A>__{all this time, they've been walking across a landscape pigmented with color steel blue, alizarin crimson, malachite green the algae varietals everywhere. and then off to the left, the algae stops. erased, like it was never there, extirpated in a long crooked line.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{what the fuck?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{yeah, what the fuck? you said doggies.}
<A>__{then he sees as well. they all see. can't help themselves. they're drawn towards it. gallagher and burchenal check their course in the distance before veering off. pettengill is already heading towards it. it's maybe 100 yards away. at 50, something indistinct can be seen. sort of. it's like the line, and the surrounding terrain is out of focus, blurry. at 30, the blurriness comes into focus. it's alive. it moves slightly. you can see through it. at ten, you can see it undulating. slowly, towards us. erasing the algae, the color slowly spreading outwards behind and diffusing. and then we can see... a billion, a hundred billion...nematodes. little tiny translucent worms. eating the algae. slowly, irrevocably. advancing. pettengill pulls out his entrenching tool. carefully separates one out. lifts it up to the light to see. maybe three inches long, skinnier than an earthworm. one end lifts in the air, a tri part mouth with little crystalline teeth opening and closing, searching for something to eat. it's fucking scary. it gets worse when you realize how many of them there are. the line's moved three or four inches closer as they stand there. they take a step back. no one can really speak yet.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{what...}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{it's a nematode. or something like one. it's probably this skinny so it defrosts each morning when the sun hits them. or they'r enot water based at all.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{is it something we sent up by accident with the probes?}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i thought we said there wasn't any life on this planet.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{we did. we were wrong. maybe there wasn't when we checked. i don't know. it's not from earth.}
<P>__{(beat; yow)}
<D>__{and it's not from here.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{this can't be. this can't be.}
<A>__{burchenal actually seems kind of upset about it. gallagher looks at him. say what? burch is upset.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{it can't be here. you don't understand. the odds of there being any other life in the universe are infinitesimally small. the odds that it could survive on something other than its home planet are equally astronomical. the odds that it could travel to another solar system, let alone one where life already existed are...impossible.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{but it's here.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{burchenal seems almost unhappy about this. it rocks his world. in a bad way. gallagher turns to pettengill happily and untroubled....}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{well, it looks like we're not alone in the universe. you just discovered life on another planet, pal.}
<A>__{it takes a moment for this to sink in. then something hits robby.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{made by god. that's what's stamped on the bottom. that's what bud would have said. he woulda loved this.}
<A>__{gallagher gets down on one knee and looks at them. they're kinda horrible, but as he turns to pettengill }
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{you know what this means? you're gonna be more famous than darwin. they're gonna name buildings after you. spacecrafts, cities on mars...}
<A>__{the enormity of how badly pettengill has screwed up that in the space of one day, he's committed murder and discovered life on another planet begins to dawn on him. he doesn't handle it well. he's fucked up like few people can imagine. he tries to reset, it doesn't work. the worm twists about, starts to eat the metal right off the entrenching tool. he flicks it back to its relatives.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{right. right. motherfuck. motherfuck.}
<A>__{and then he says something really odd }
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{name them after santen.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{you hated santen.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he storms away. they're both confused by this. pettengill finds a rock, sits down behind it. he's obscured except for his head and shoulders.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{i need a minute or two.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{you wanna tell houston?}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{go ahead. you do it. just give me a few minutes.}
