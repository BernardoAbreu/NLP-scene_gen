<L>__{interior cockpit night}
<A>__{elaine enters, turns to face rumack. oveur is at controls in f.g.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{doctor rumack, mister hammen ate fish. and randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.}
<C>__{dr. rumack}
<D>__{let's see now. the co pilot had fish. what did the navigator eat?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{he had fish, too.}
<A>__{oveur is picking up on the conversation.}
<C>__{dr. rumack}
<D>__{all right, now we know what we're up against. every passenger on this plane who ate fish for dinner will become violently ill within the next half hour.}
<A>__{oveur looks down at his dinner tray and sees skeleton of the fish he just ate.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{just how serious is it, doctor?}
<C>__{dr. rumack}
<D>__{extremely serious. it starts with a slight fever.}
<A>__{oveur experiences what the doctor is describing.}
<C>__{dr. rumack}
<D>__{then a dryness in the throat. as the virus penetrates the red blood cells the victim becomes dizzy and begins to experience a rash and itching. from there the poison works its way into the central nervous system causing severe muscle spasms, followed by the inevitable drooling. at this point, the entire digestive system is rendered useless, causing the complete collapse of the lower bowels, accompanied by uncontrollable flatulence...until finally the poor bastard is reduced to a quivering, wasted piece of jelly.}
<A>__{oveur passes out and pitches forward onto the controls. rumack and elaine lose balance as plane dives.}
