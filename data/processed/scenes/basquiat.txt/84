<D>__{... had over fifty articles written about you, switched galleries how many times? dj'd in the hottest clubs }
<A>__{jean looks out the window, yawns and rubs his eyes. he now sports dreadlocks bundled into groups of spikes sticking out of his head. he wears a wrinkled wesleyan college t shirt, paint splattered jeans, and no shoes; just out of bed, it would seem. an interviewer a balding brit with all the humor of a bank clerk tries to buddy up with jean on camera.}
<C>__{interviewer }
<D>__{... one of the youngest artists ever to be included in the whitney biennial, also produced a rap record. it's said you're quite the ladies man even dated madonna for a couple months!!!}
<P>__{(takes a breath)}
<D>__{all at the ripe old age of 24. one might ask: is there anything left for jean michel basquiat to do?}
<A>__{jean and the interviewer face each other in front of one of jean's paintings. jean stares at the interviewer, incredulous.}
<C>__{interviewer }
<D>__{what is it that gets you out of bed in the morning?}
<P>__{(nervous laugh)}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{i hate this. turn that off.}
<A>__{jean walks off camera and disappears into his bedroom. shenge (the former limo driver, now working as jean's assistant) assembles stretchers. super: "great jones street, 1985" a camera crew waits in the room. jean returns.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{we're running a little late.}

<A>__{he points to some scribbled words on the canvas.}
<C>__{interviewer }
<D>__{... can you... decipher this for us?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{decipher?}
<C>__{interviewer}

<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{they're just words.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{yes, i understand but where do you take them from?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{where? do you ask miles where he got that note from? where do you take your words from?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{everywhere.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<P>__{(pointing to a detail)}
<D>__{what are they?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<P>__{(smiling mischievously)}
<D>__{leeches. a long list of leeches.}
<P>__{(looking at some frames shenge's working on)}
<D>__{it looks good like that.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{hmmm. and 'parasites.'}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you seem to be a primal expressionist.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{you mean like an ape?}
<A>__{he grabs a huge double mouthful of french fries and washes them down with champagne..}
<C>__{basquiat }
<P>__{(chewing, spilling)}
<D>__{a primate?}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{well, you said that.}
<P>__{(beat looks at notes)}
<D>__{you've got a lot of references from leonardo da vinci, don't you?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{oh, that's a "leonardo's greatest hits" painting. you like it?}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{yes, but as a black painter }
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{i use a lot of colors not only black.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{i'm not black.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{you're not?}

<D>__{not what?}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{not black.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{no, i'm haitian puerto rican.}
<A>__{the buzzer sounds. he signals for steve not to answer the door.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{yes, yes... let's talk about that.... your roots... your father is from haiti, isn't he?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<P>__{(growing weary)}
<D>__{yup.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{hmmmm. interesting. and when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?}
<C>__{basquiat}

<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{why, that's from time magazine.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{no, he said i was the eddie murphy of the art world. he said the eddie murphy.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?}
<A>__{jean walks off camera like he just received a punch in the stomach. the filming of the interview becomes increasingly erratic.}
<C>__{interviewer }
<D>__{let me... just... open something up here. you come from a nice, middle class, respectable home. your father is an accountant. why did you at one time live in a cardboard box in tompkins square?}
<A>__{jean walks back into frame.}
<C>__{interviewer }
<D>__{or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{are those the only two possibilities?}
<P>__{(cramming a french fry into his mouth)}
<D>__{you wanna french fry?}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{ok. one last thing. is there any anger in you? any anger in your work?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{should there be?}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{tell me about it. what are you angry about?}
<A>__{jean drifts off.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{mmmm. i don't know. i don't remember.}
