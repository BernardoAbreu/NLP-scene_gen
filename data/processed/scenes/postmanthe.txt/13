<L>__{76 ball}
<A>__{cramped, the postman's busy at the base of the ball, trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt. it won't budge.}
<B>__{ladder}
<A>__{the hulking bandit has only a few more rungs to go.}
<L>__{76 ball}
<A>__{no good. time's up. the postman starts rocking the pole.}
<B>__{ladder}
<A>__{the hulking bandit has reached the opening feels the rocking motion. hangs on.}
<L>__{76 ball}
<A>__{knife in hand, the hulking bandit looks inside. at that instant, the postman rocks the pole one more time. the rusty bolt is not enough to keep the ball's full weight in place. it pops. the ball is frozen for an instant before going with the pole's tilt.}
<B>__{ladder}
<A>__{the 76 ball drops off the pole, rolling over the hulking bandit's back and down the ladder's incline. the other bandits dive clear as the 76 ball hurtles past.}
<B>__{the postman}
<A>__{whips head over heels as the ball speeds away.}
<B>__{field}
<A>__{the 76 ball launches off a dirt berm, but soon comes to a stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts apart. fighting the vertigo, the postman staggers to his feet.}

<D>__{bill!}
<A>__{bill bolts from the station as the lead bandit raises the rifle and fires at the postman. losing balance, the postman lands on his butt just before a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head. wobbly, he tries to gather his packs. the bandits charge, quickly closing the ground, but bill is there first. holding as much as he can, the postman heaves himself over bill's back. as the mule gallops away, the lead bandit aims the rifle. he's got the postman in his sights. he's about to fire when bandit #20 stands up into the shot. he's got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and he's laughing like a hyena!}
<D>__{bandit #20 we're rich!}
