<L>__{interior easy's house}
<A>__{he pushes open the door. shariff loiters just inside, grinning at him, and manny stands in the middle of the living room looking at the floor. from a radio in another room tommy dorsey plays "blue skies" with frank sinatra out front. and so easy walks past the two hoods into}
<B>__{the kitchen}
<A>__{albright turns from looking out the backyard window with a porcelain coffee cup cradled in his right hand.}
<C>__{albright}

<A>__{easy looks at the coffee pot on the stove and again at albright, smiling loose and friendly but looking tired in the same clothes he had on at the pier.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{what you doin' in my house, man?}
<C>__{albright}

<D>__{where have you been this time of morning, easy?}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i went to see a girl. don't you get none, mr. albright?}
<A>__{the smile leaves albright's face and his eyes turn even colder.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{i didn't come here to play, boy. you got my money in your pocket and we've been over at that address waitin' all night for frank green and now we've found out that he moved from there over a year ago.}
<A>__{easy is scared and confused but he plays it off.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{so what do you want me to do about it? you don't think i did my job. shit, i give you the money back.}
<A>__{and he reaches for his pocket, but albright reaches too and suddenly, manny and shariff are in the room and on easy like a vice. albright presses the barrel of the .45 against easy's forehead.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{do you believe in god, easy? 'cause i'm curious to see if death is any different for a religious man.}
<A>__{easy looks down, away from the gun, and swallows hard.}

<D>__{i seen her.}
<A>__{after a moment, everyone relaxes and easy sags out from under their grip and staggers into}
<B>__{the living room}
<A>__{manny and shariff surround him as he sits down in a chair and albright stalks in holstering his gun.}
<C>__{albright}

<C>__{albright}
<D>__{why didn't you call me?}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i couldn't. she threatened to tell the cops that i had killed coretta...}
<A>__{albright looks over at his henchmen.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{easy}

<C>__{albright}

<C>__{albright}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{uh hunh.}
<A>__{albright looks around the room as if answers lie in the corners, but he is not surprised to hear about a body.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{you call the cops?}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i tried my best to keep in the speed limit. that's all i did.}

<D>__{where'd you pick her up at?}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{she left that place }
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{ write it down!}
<A>__{to his shame easy flinches and gets paper from his end table, then scribbles down the address and hands it to albright who takes easy's seat and examines the note.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{get me some whiskey, easy.}
<A>__{easy studies albright who sits knees wide apart, now the master of the house, and he can't help himself.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{get it yourself... bottle's in the cabinet.}
<A>__{albright looks up and easy braces himself for albright to bring on the end, all at once. but slowly a smile spreads across albright's face and he laughs, stamping his foot.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{well, i will be damned. get us a drink, manny... easy, you're a brave man. i need a brave man working for me... but you gotta find frank green, so he can lead us to her.}
<C>__{easy}

<C>__{albright}
<D>__{easy, you're connectable to two murders. you'll do whatever i tell you to do.}
<A>__{manny brings albright's drink and the captain turns it up and gives manny back the glass.}
<C>__{albright}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now you got three days to find him. and you make sure you count 'em right.}
<A>__{he walks out the screen door with manny and shariff following.}
<B>__{kitchen}
<A>__{easy grabs the bottle from the counter, where manny has left it, and pours himself a stiff one. but he only stares into the glass.}
