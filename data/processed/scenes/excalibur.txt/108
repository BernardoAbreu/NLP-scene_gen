<D>__{the law forbids it.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{love demands it.}
<A>__{hungry with passion, she embraces the cold unmoving armor, kissing it.}

<D>__{guenevere...}
<A>__{he folds her in his arm, and their bodies lock together as though a trap had sprung. their mouths meet, each devouring the other...}
