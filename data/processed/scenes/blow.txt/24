<D>__{california was like nothing i'd ever experienced. the people were liberated and independent and full of new ideas. george (v.o.) (cont'd) they used words like "right on," "groovy," and "solid." the women are all beautiful and seemed to share the same occupation. woman #1 i'm a flight attendant. woman #2 i'm a flight attendant. woman #3 i'm a flight attendant.}
<A>__{the weed comes out and is passed around. pipes. joints. bongs. in slow motion, barbara takes a huge hit of grass, grabs george's face, french kissing him, and giving him a huge shotgun.}
