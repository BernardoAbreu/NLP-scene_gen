<L>__{interior large winery day}
<A>__{now inside, miles grabs the first dirty wine glass he finds and shakes it out as he approaches the closest tasting station. he pushes his way to front. the pourer offers the usual one ounce dollop. miles jacks it back, immediately extending his glass for more.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hit me again.}
<A>__{the same small amount is poured and downed. once again miles holds out his glass.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{pour me a full glass. i will pay for it.}
<C>__{pourer}
<D>__{this is a tasting, sir. not a bar.}
<A>__{miles slams a twenty dollar bill on the table.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{just give me a full goddamn pour.}
<A>__{the pourer turns away to serve another party. miles looks around indignantly, as though everyone should be sympathetic to this injustice. now miles boldly reaches over and pours himself a glass right up to the brim and beyond.}
<C>__{pourer}
<D>__{sir, what are you doing?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i told you i need a drink.}
<C>__{pourer}
<D>__{then buy a bottle and go outside.}
<A>__{the pourer grabs miles by the wrist before he can drink.}
<C>__{pourer}
<D>__{put the glass down.}
<A>__{in the ensuing struggle, the wine spills, and everyone nearby steps back.}
<C>__{pourer}
<D>__{you're going to have to leave, sir.}
<A>__{the pourer signals to a security guy at the door. across the room jack notices the disturbance and heads over. miles hoists up the spit bucket, holds it aloft and starts to guzzle it. wine cascades down the sides of his face, onto his shirt and even onto his shiny new shoes. the security guy yanks the bucket away from miles, and drags him toward the exit. jack catches up.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to the horrified onlookers)}
<D>__{it's all right. his mother just died.}
