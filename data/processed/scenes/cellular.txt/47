<C>__{jessica }
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{lord of the rings! i forgot his father bought him a lord of the rings lunchbox last week!}
<A>__{ryan's heart stops in his chest. he turns to see the boy with the lord or the rings lunchbox racing down the school steps and up to one of the waiting escalades.}
<C>__{ryan}
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{ricky martin!!}
<A>__{the boy opens the car door...but turns as he hears his name called. for the briefest moment, ricky and ryan lock eyes and that's when a hand reaches out, snags his backpack and yanks ricky into the dark of the car! instantly, the door slams shut and the escalade begins to take off. whip pan to ryan's shocked reaction. he's the only one who's seen it. he tries to struggle free of the guard.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{oh shit! you just see that?!}

<D>__{rent a cops hey ! !}
<A>__{they chase after him, but ryan hops over the hood of the idling rent a cop car and throws himself into its driver's seat. rent a cop #1 reaches through the open window and grabs ryan's collar and is dragged twenty feet as ryan throws the little car in gear and burns away.}
