<L>__{ext desert day}
<A>__{... a dust storm. the wind is howling. the swirling dust thins to reveal dr.parnassus, alone, exhausted, trudging across a vast desert. he's tormented by his thoughts.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{what else could i do, valentina? what else could i have done... what other choice could i have made?... damn!... it was the right choice... of course it was... of course... but where are you?}
<C>__{dr. parnassus }
<D>__{where's my beautiful daughter? where's my darling? how long must i suffer?}
<A>__{there is no proper road, only endless sand, but nevertheless dr. parnassus reaches a signpost which indicates two distinct paths. one leads to a tidy little suburban home, the other up an dramatic mountain pass via a painfully steep staircase cut into the rock (the same one that martin the drunk chose not to climb days earlier.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus }
<D>__{no, no, no... no more choices, please... no more choices...!!!}
<A>__{enraged, he tries to push the sign over, but is too feeble. exhausted, he subsides onto a smooth protruding stone.}
<C>__{voice }
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{dr. parnassus, alarmed, rolls quickly off the stone. now on his knees he finds himself looking at the top half of percy's head and face. what he'd thought was a stone was, in fact, his old companion buried in the sand.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{percy!}
<A>__{dr. parnassus, overjoyed, begins to dig percy out.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{about bloody time!}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{where have you been?}
<C>__{percy}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{here!}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{how long have you been here?}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{how long's a piece of string? don't ask daft questions.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{thank god i found you. i need your advice.}
<P>__{(indicating sign)}
<D>__{i've got a problematical choice to make.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{problematical my arse! come on... i know it's against the grain...}
<A>__{percy grabs dr. parnassus's cloak and begins to pull him across the sand in the direction of the bungalow. we can now see the sign reads `easy'...}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(on his dignity)}
<D>__{no! suburban bungalows and all that they evoke are anathema to me. dammit percy! stop! i've got my pride!}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{yeah, it goes just before the fall.}
<A>__{percy grabs dr. parnassus's cloak and begins to pull him across the sand in the direction indicated by the sign which we can now see reads 'easy'..}
<C>__{percy }
<D>__{come on... i know it's against the grain...}
