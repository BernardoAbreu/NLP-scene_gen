<A>__{anderson waves to lisa. her big studebaker drives off down the tree lined street and away. anderson approaches his chevy. he doesn't take out a key to unlock it. there is no lock. he slides in behind the wheel. doesn't take out a key for the ignition there is no ignition. a thin metallic arm arches down from the sun visor, scans anderson's eyes, identifying him. a seat harness wraps around him, and the car starts. anderson picks up a folder marked "precrime" and begins to read through the papers. the chevy backs out of the driveway and takes him to work.}
