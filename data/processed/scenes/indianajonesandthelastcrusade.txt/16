<A>__{as indy runs from the railroad tracks and approaches his house we see the name "jones" painted on the mailbox.}

<D>__{dad!}
<L>__{interior the house day}
<A>__{indy bursts through the front door holding the cross in his hand. a husky barks as indy runs past in search of his father.}

<D>__{dad!}
<L>__{interior the study day}
<A>__{indy charges in. the study is cluttered with books. pictures, charts and maps clearly reflect the father's passion for medieval studies. professor henry jones is absorbed at his desk. in fact, he is studying a very ancient parchment volume which lies open on the desk. the page shows a beautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained glass window. the sketch incorporates a series of roman numerals. the professor is not just studying it, he is copying it into his own notebook. we never get to see the professor's face in this scene. so indy charges in.}

<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(now he shouts)}
<D>__{junior!}
<A>__{no question who is the boss here. indy gulps, his look says "what am i going to do with this guy?" and obeys starts counting, very, very faintly.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{one, two, three, four...}
<A>__{now we see what henry is concentrating on. we see his hand sketching; then, he holds up one finger.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{in greek.}
<A>__{indy's reaction:}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(louder, in greek)}
<D>__{one... two... three... four...}
<A>__{an ancient car is heard arriving. perhaps indy glimpses it going past the window. anyway, it stops outside the house. two men sit in the front seat. herman sits in the rear, blowing a trumpet. indy's reaction: trouble! henry is just finishing the sketch.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{may he who illuminated this... illuminate me...}
