<A>__{tino is about to shoot when jelly comes up behind him, throws one strong arm around his neck in a powerful choke hold, and grabs tino's gun hand with his free hand. vitti hears the sounds of a scuffle, steps out of the bathroom, and sees jelly struggling with tino. tino gets off a couple of wild shots, but jelly finally shakes the gun loose from tino's hand. vitti picks up the gun and puts it to tino's head. tino shuts his eyes and turns away, expecting the shot, but then vitti's hand starts to shake and he breaks into a cold sweat. tino opens his eyes, sees vitti frozen, and starts fighting with renewed strength. jelly hangs on, looks at vitti with concern, then wrestles tino out onto the balcony.}
