<A>__{faust's body, crushed in the inner door, floats weightlessly in the vacuum. his nose and mouth are crusted with huge gobs of dried blood.}

<A>__{the three survivors standard, roby and hunter slump into chairs. the cat emerges from a hiding place, yowling with fear.}
<C>__{roby}
<P>__{(picking up the cat)}
<D>__{poor kitty; puss puss puss.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{at least we're rid of the damn monster. it must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{no such luck. i saw it running down one of the corridors.}
<C>__{hunter}
<P>__{(groans)}
<D>__{oh no! we can't fight this thing! there's only six hours of air left we're dead men!}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{i don't buy that. there's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers. hunter how ?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{it's time for drastic remedies.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{it was time for that a couple days ago.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{that kind of remark is pointless. now come on i want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{we can't kill it on board. it's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{i've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{let's hear it.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{okay. first we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{that'll blow the ship up.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core. in the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{blow the ship up?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{and the creature with it. we can make it back to irth in the lifeboat.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{but the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{doesn't matter we're already at light speed. and when we get back to the colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{what about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold? that's the only reason we came out here. we'd have to abandon them all. we'd be broke.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{our lives are more important. anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{no, it won't work and i just realized why. there's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. only one of us could survive.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{yeah... i forgot.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{but the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.}
<A>__{they think.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{if we could just get the creature into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{good! that's good!}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{we can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{i think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{we can use the flamethrower.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{it's not going to work.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{you can't say that; i think it's a good plan.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{the flamethrower needs more fuel.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{right. we've got a lot to accomplish. let's get moving.}
