<A>__{crumpling, jack weeps. zero, ever faithful, makes himself a hankie and wipes jack's wet eyes. >>>>> jack's saddest of sad songs. jack sings as if his heart had broken in two. he is at his lowest of lows. yet, being jack, being irrepressibly buoyant, by the end of the song, he has completely worked himself back up from grief very nearly to exuberance he must save santa! he must restore christmas as it should be! he opens a tombstone, lifting it up as easily as if it were the door to a storm cellar and, filled with determination, runs back down toward halloweenland.}
