<A>__{below this is a magazine advertisement showing frances in a glossy chesterfield ad. her hair is swept up off her head, and she looks glamorous, artificial, very different from how we've seen her. lillian takes up the paste brush and liberally swabs the opposite blank page of her scrapbook. a handwritten letter from frances lies beside her. she removes a clipping from the letter and spreads it out. the clipping says: "stars of tomorrow" and shows a semi circle of girl's faces inside garish stars. lillian circles frances' photo and sits back to admire it.}
