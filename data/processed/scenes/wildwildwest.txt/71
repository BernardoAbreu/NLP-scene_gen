<B>__{night}
<A>__{eases in, stops at what he sees. and it sure ain't scientists. beside the bed, locked in an iron disco like cage, is rita, still wearing her scanty outfit. gordon squints at her, gives a charming smile.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i feel as if we know each other from someplace...?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{try again, buster...!}
<A>__{she takes a breath as if she's going to start screaming. gordon quickly holds up a hand.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{ma'am, please! while i realize i look like something straight out of james fenimore cooper... i mean you no harm. my name is artemus gordon. and you look like you're in trouble.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{to rita's amazement, gordon opens his jacket and unbuttons his vest to reveal... a complete miniature tool shop. quickly he pulls out a thin cable and attaches it to a tiny wheel on the spur of one of his boots.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i'm rita. i was hired here as an entertainer. not that i'm complaining, but what are you doin' in here?}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(looking up miles of leg)}
<D>__{looking for some missing scientists... not that i'm complaining.}
<A>__{gordon unsnaps the sole of his shoe. it becomes a pedal that operates the wheels' rotation. now he removes a bit and handle from his vest and attaches the cable. starts to pump his foot. it's a foot powered drill.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i'm a special u.s. marshal on assignment from the president.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(almost impressed)}
<D>__{if you're so special, how come you're lookin' up here when loveless has 'em all workin' down in the dungeon?}
<P>__{(rattles bars impatiently)}
<D>__{get me out of here and i will take you down there.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{too late. the 'dungeon' is cleaned out. it was the first place i checked, right after i sampled the gumbo. bit heavy on the okra.}
<A>__{but rita isn't listening to the food review. her mind's racing. finally, the lock clicks and the cage door swings open. gordon takes the distressed damsel in his arms, lifts her out.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(suddenly a coquettish smile)}
<D>__{thank you... artemus, was it?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{one doesn't forget a smile like that. now where in the world was it...? have you ever played the empire room... the bijou cafe perhaps...?}
