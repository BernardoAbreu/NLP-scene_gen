<L>__{83 exterior pet sematary night}
<A>__{dark clouds paint the foreboding sky. a broken pulse of lightning streaks through the dense haze. abandoning their bikes next to the path, drew and geoff approach the archway. the graveyard beyond is deathly silent. they pass beneath the archway, entering the clearing. and now, a soft, chilling voice drifts over the graves.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{geoff, honey. mommy's here...}
<A>__{geoff freezes in his tracks, awestruck as... a woman's body swoops down from the darkness above, materializing out of nowhere. a fluttering negligee. flowing blonde hair. renee's face appears out of the shadows, masked with sadness. geoff swallows the lump in his throat. renee's form keeps coming. but even as she approaches, her visage grows less distinguishable. just a phantom countenance now. a shadow framed by golden hair, resting atop a veiled body... she's coming so fast that she's upon geoff in no time. he fumbles back, startled out of his wits... the body is upon him now, flailing wildly. geoff thrashes and struggles, screaming bloody murder. gradually, he realizes the body isn't fighting back. geoff eases his struggle, lets his scream fall off. now he hears wild, mischievous laughter. drew pulls the body away. it's just a heavy wad of stuffed clothing: a dummy dressed in a negligee, capped by a blonde wig. it dangles near the end of a slanted wire. clyde, stevie, brad, and a half dozen other costumed kids appear from the nearby cover of bushes, doubled over in laughter. clyde tugs at a piece of twine that's connected to the back of the dummy's head and makes spooky sounds. the dummy jumps around on the slanted wire. clyde drops the dummy and saunters forward.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{look at this, junior here practically shit his pants.}
<A>__{clyde drops down, nose to nose with geoff, who's still recovering.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{maybe you're too chicken to hang out with the rest of the boys. you gonna run home to daddy now?}
<A>__{geoff brushes himself off and rises to his feet. he stares into clyde's eyes.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{fuck off.}
<A>__{geoff pushes past clyde and moves on into the graveyard, somehow managing to keep his dignity intact. drew follows, then the rest of the boys, leaving clyde staring after them, standing alone with the dummy.}
