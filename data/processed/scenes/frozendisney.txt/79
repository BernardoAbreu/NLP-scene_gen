<A>__{elsa is surrounded. it's do or die. in two swift moves, elsa traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck. the other she pushes back with a wall of ice....up against the balcony doors...which burst and crack. out onto the balcony.... the balcony doors shatter. the thug is pushed to the edge. he's inches away from falling to his death. back inside: hans and his men run in. see the destruction and the thugs near death.}

<D>__{queen elsa! don't be the monster they fear you are.}
<A>__{elsa snaps out of her rage. she sees the men, frightened, moments from death. she stops. elsa looks to hans, overwhelmed, frightened. the wall retreats from the thug on the balcony. the ice spikes lower from the second thug's neck. he takes advantage and aims his crossbow at elsa's back. seeing it. hans runs and pushes the crossbow up just as the arrow releases. the arrow hits the ice chandelier, hanging directly above elsa. the chandelier comes crashing down. elsa dives out of the way but she falls in the blast. all we see is ice smashing like glass, and all we hear is the sound of it shattering as it rings out.}
