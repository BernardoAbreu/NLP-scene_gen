<A>__{leaning over, listening, taking in the aroma of...}
<L>__{interior joan's room}
<A>__{max's cigar. he sits slightly apart from joan, sunil, aloka, ram, hasari, selima, margareta, surya, saladdin, ashish and shanta, aristotle john, mehboub, anouar, and said. hasari is stretched out, aloka rubbing his screaming legs. throughout the following, their eyes meet and deflect...}
<C>__{saladdin}
<D>__{the godfather is at least civilized. the son is vicious. remember the last elections the molotov coctails, the blows with iron bars. they'll throw us out. we won't be able to find anyone else to rent to us. we'll just have to agree to pay what he wants.}
<C>__{mehboub}
<D>__{saladdin's right. neither nature nor the people with the power have any conscience. we have to pay.}
<A>__{a sigh escapes surya. he shakes his head. eyes flick at him.}
<C>__{ashish}
<D>__{what do you say, doctor big brother?}
<C>__{sunil}
<D>__{i think we must try to break the godfather's hold on us.}
<A>__{this is startling and is met with a babble of cautious agreement and dispute.}
<C>__{sunil}
<D>__{please, hear me out. but i think we have to be very cautious.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{how the hell do you proceed with caution against these people? you can't. you have to risk everything.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{you try to negotiate with these people, you make compromises with them, they'll eat you alive. stand up against them now and they'll fold. i guarantee it. underneath, they're cowards, they got no guts. we show them we're strong and the'll just move on to easier pickings.}
<C>__{ashish}
<D>__{we? you have an airplane ticket.}
<A>__{still, he's clearly piqued a lot of support.}
<C>__{sunil}
<D>__{you know, max, this is not american gangster television.}
<C>__{saladdin}
<D>__{yes, if you're wrong, you don't have to be here.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm not wrong. you bow your heads, you plead with your gods to do what you won't do yourselves. you put up with this nightmare as if there were no choice. i'm telling you, if you don't stand up to that little pimple face now, he'll own you for the rest of your lives.}
<A>__{everyone stares at him. many of them want to buy his commitment. there's another large sigh from surya. aloka and hasari's eyes bang off of each other, she silently urging him to speak. he's deeply conflicted and deeply frightened.}
<C>__{anouar}
<D>__{even though i am invisible to some of you and i don't have a complete set of legs to stand on, i stand with the doctor big brother. maybe nature doesn't have a conscience or those with the power, but don't we?}
<A>__{said, the giant mute, mades an unintelligible sound in his throat, but clearly he's agreeing with anouar.}
<C>__{margareta}
<D>__{i agree with anouar and max daddah. i think it's worth the chance.}
<A>__{silence... until aloka and hasari's meet again and, out of his terrible fear and conflict, he says very shyly...}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{is it permitted to speak?}
<A>__{there are quick nods around the room. with great difficulty, hasari says his piece.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i want my children to be educated and cared for; this is our home, we have never had such friends. but many of us owe a great debt to the godfather. he is strong and could kill us... but we must choose. i trust my big brother. i say we must stand up.}
<A>__{there's still dissension, but somewhat more support. said makes a fierce, unintelligible supportive sound. surya sighs again. eyes flick at the old man.}
<C>__{sunil}
<D>__{sister joan, what do you think, really?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{well, i think max has hit on the heart of what we're trying to build here: a self help society. each of us has to decide for himself. as for me, i suppose i think, really, that if the bastards are going to suck us dry, i'd like to get in a couple of good left handers before i turn the other cheek.}
<C>__{salladin}
<D>__{but who will rent to us!}
<A>__{surya clucks his tongue and shakes his head; everyone assumes he is preparing a heated refutation of the resisters. his sighs, though, have been a building commitment.}
<C>__{surya}
<D>__{i have a property i will rent you for two hundred rupees a month, and not a rupee less. as for protection... you are on your own.}
<A>__{many of the faces are uncertain hasari's notable among them. montage interior exterior cowsheds day a) two cows are shooed out of the ramshackle building as bustling activity on the new clinic begins. cleaning the place. debris being torn out, hurled into a pile in the street. b) said, with the strength of three men, holds up a heavy beam while hasari tries to secure it. max, hot, smelly, and hating the place, stands in the middle of the room, wishing he were elsewhere. the beams starts to slip. max leaps to hasari's side. c) we see that max and hasari are thrown together again in some carpentering task in uneasy camaraderie. a finger pokes max on the back. he turns to find poomina holding out two cups of tea. d) the whole group shares a meal, prepared under the direction of selima, though the lepers remain separate from the normals. anouar leads the lepers in singing a song. joan and margareta pick it up, as do several other of the normals. e) equipment from the old school clinic being moved from the square down here. f) max and aloka do one of those dances where two people with arms loaded try to go around each other. finally he says he'll stand still and she should go around him. they both laugh. hasari watches. g) as max puts medicine into a cabinet, ram peeks in, nods his approval, "helpfully" passes max something max can reach just fine himself, shows max an enormous hole in his shorts and hits max for ten rupees. h) a small truck carrying a charitable organization's logo on the side is being unloaded of powdered milk and various other things. i) upstairs and stairwell hasari and max move the last cot upstairs and into place beside a window that will come into play at the end (it looks down on the street). hasari nods to max, indicating he should look. j) their pov everyone gathered as shanta and ashish put a banner above the door: "you are invited to the festival of this world and your life is blessed." the assemblage applauds and embraces. k) upstairs hasari smiles at max, brings his hands together, but doesn't embrace the doctor.}
