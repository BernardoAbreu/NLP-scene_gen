<A>__{as he enters, looks for and then spot carol. she is having a martini at the bar... sitting on a stool watching couples dance... happy by herself... turning down a man who wants to buy her another... and melvin watches... watches his date.}
<C>__{head waiter}
<D>__{shall i get her for you?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{no, it's all right. i will just watch.}
<A>__{he enjoys watching her for a few more beats... she turns melvin makes a "haul your ass over here" gesture... and she smiles and walks toward him... a waiter has lifted her drink placed it on a tray and follows her. she takes a bit of a slalom course through the tables, giddy as the music plays and couples dance in the b.g. she notices the waiter in her trail.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(mouthing the words to melvin)}
<D>__{my drink is following me.}
<A>__{melvin watches her approach. it is all too exquisite. he takes a breath it doesn't come easily.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{you look s...}
<A>__{she stops herself from saying "sexy," regathers, then...}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{you look great.}
<A>__{they arrives at the table. he holds out her chair for her.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{you wanna dance?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{no...}
<P>__{(and before she can digest that)}
<D>__{... i don't get this place. they make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. i don't get it.}
<B>__{on carol}
<A>__{melvin has no idea he has insulted her. sandbagged in extreme, she gets up actually ready to leave.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{no. wait. what? why? i didn't mean it. you gotta sit down. you can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{melvin, pay me a compliment... i need one and quick... you have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(really pissed, mutters)}
<D>__{that monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. never fails.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{that's not compliment, melvin... that's just trying to sound smart so i feel stupid... a compliment is something nice about somebody else... now or never.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{he waves her down.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(sitting)}
<D>__{and mean it...}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{can we order first?}
<A>__{she thinks and then nods. the waiter is across the room. this does not stop melvin.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.}
<P>__{(to carol)}
<D>__{baked or fries?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{fries.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{one baked one fries.}
<C>__{startled waiter}
<P>__{(shouting back)}
<D>__{i will tell your waiter.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(to carol)}
<D>__{okay, i got a real great compliment for you and it's true.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i am so afraid you're about to say something awful...}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{don't be pessimistic. it's not your style. okay... here i goes... clearly a mistake.}
<P>__{(this is hell for him)}
<D>__{i have this what? ailment... and my doctor a shrink... who i used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. i hate pills. very dangerous things, pills. "hate," i am using the word "hate" about pills. my compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never well, you were there, you know... the next morning i started taking these pills.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(a little confused)}
<D>__{i don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.}
<A>__{amazing that something in melvin rises to the occasion so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly then:}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{you make me want to be a better man.}
<A>__{carol never expected the kind of praise which would so slip under her guard. she stumbles a bit flattered, momentarily moved and his for the taking.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{that's maybe the best compliment of my life.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{then i've really overshot here 'cause i was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.}
<A>__{carol laughs.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{so how are you doing with those pills? well, i hopahopahopa.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{takes months to know... they work little by little.}
<P>__{(holds his head; then)}
<D>__{talking like this is exhausting.}
<A>__{carol moves to the chair next to him... she sits very close he tenses.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{never.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{here's the trouble with never.}
<B>__{tight shot}
<A>__{for the kiss. their faces are close she looks at him... she closes her eyes her face moving toward him he is wide eyed and afraid... his face almost moves away in a shot this close it's almost flight... but now his head moves back and he receives her kiss. it is brief. carol smiles encouragement to him and herself. melvin can't bear the pleasure.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{you don't owe me that.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{that wasn't payment. when you first came into breakfast, when i saw you i thought you were handsome... then, of course, you spoke... so now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. tell me, why did you bring me?}
<A>__{melvin's voice is soft hesitant, okay, vulnerable... as he holds up his hands in a "stop" signal.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{well, ah... that's a personal question.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{tell me even if you're scared. tell me why you wanted me here. it's okay.}
<A>__{she kisses him again.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{if you ask me... i will say, "yes."}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(dissembling)}
<D>__{there are lots of reason... i had a thought that if you had sex with simon it might...}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(humiliated)}
<D>__{sex with simon?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{it's one idea...}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{that's why you brought me? look at me! is that really why you brought me... like i'm a what and i owe you what?!}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i don't know why i brought you that idea occurred to me is all... it came out first... hey, you kiss him me... he says he loves you. you two hit it off. but you don't want to... fine... forget what i said about sex with simon. it was a mistake.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(wiping away tears)}
<D>__{i will never forget you said it.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{it was a mistake.}
<A>__{but she has already turned away and exits the restaurant... melvin alone and miserable.}
