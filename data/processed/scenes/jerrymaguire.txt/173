<A>__{jerry maguire surrounded by well wishers and backslappers and sportswriters. success has returned, in all of it's superficial grandeur. he is a star again, by association. we catch the look on maguire's face. try as he might, he can't manufacture the joy of the moment. there is a void. over the heads of the heatseekers we see dennis wilburn nodding, holding a thumbs up. he tries to get to maguire, but cannot. and then a commotion behind them all.}

<D>__{it's tidwell!}
<A>__{tidwell exits the locker room. press and media surround him. even the grizzled old time stadium workers reach in to squeeze him, to slap him, to touch him. he works his way to maguire. they hug. cameras flash. tears roll down from beneath his purple shades.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{we did it.}
<A>__{and now, in the middle of this emotional union, a portable phone rings. both men reach for their porties. it's maguire's. with anticipation, he answers.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{hello.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's marcee. she says she couldn't get through on your phone.}
<A>__{tidwell grabs the phone, and joyously shares the moment with his wife. jerry watches, as tidwell leans on his shoulder. on sugar and swenson (watching them) bob sugar watches from the nearby wall where he stands with his client, quarterback john swenson.}

<D>__{why don't we have that kind of relationship?}
