<L>__{exterior ocean day}
<A>__{waves are being kicked up by a large passenger ship as it speeds on its way. cut : to asakawa and ryuji standing on deck, looking out over the waves.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{i shouldve been more careful. when i was at your place that day, i could feel something there. i thought it was just because of the video...}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{you mean that tomoko}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{thats not tomoko. not anymore.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{yoichi... he can see them too, cant he?}
<A>__{ryuji nods his head, lowers it sadly.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{its all my fault. first tomoko died, then those three others. it should have stopped there, but it didnt. because of me.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{i wonder...}
<A>__{asakawa turns to ryuji suddenly.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{how did the rumors about the video even start in the first place?}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{this kind of thing... it doesnt start by one person telling a story. its more like everyones fear just takes on a life of its own.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{fear...}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{or maybe its not fear at all. maybe its what we were secretly hoping for all along.}
