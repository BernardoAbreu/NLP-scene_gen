<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{i think buzz is retiring soon. in fact, i think he's retiring tonight. kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of sheila.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{here, bunny. why don't you two go and do something fun tonight, on me. sheila is lured to the scent of the plastic like a junkie to a fix.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{one thing, stay away from the lanes. if junior sees you two together, he'll swallow his tongue. she reaches for the card and kastle snatches it away from her with a chortle.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{what did i say?}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{don't go near the bowling alley.}
