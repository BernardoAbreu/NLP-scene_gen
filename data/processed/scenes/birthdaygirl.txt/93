<L>__{exterior john's garden night}
<A>__{the small party has moved outside to the patio, where they sit around a low wooden table in the mellow candlelight. a huge late summer moon hangs over the fields. alexei tinkles beautifully on his guitar. he stops asks a question in russian.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{oh nothing.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{no. it is too judgmental.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{tell me what he said.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{he says why did you send to russia for a wife.}
<A>__{silence. john suddenly looks sick.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{you are not ashamed of it? it's no surprise to want to love.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no. it's not that.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{do you believe in love?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i suppose it's... i mean define your terms.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{it's very strange. how many people are truly themselves with their love? it is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. there are no marches against heartache, no ministries against loneliness, no concerts against disappointment. we look away. and still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. the one thing we all share but don't say. look john i will show you something.}
<A>__{he takes a plate and starts reaching for the food.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{here look, something beautiful from russia. here is life, there, take it.}
<A>__{john accepts the plate.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{here is bread. khylep. this is work. we all need this, here eat.}
<A>__{john eats.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{good. but we cannot survive with just work, so here is meat and blood. myasa. this is family and country, flesh, strength, eat.}
<A>__{john bites the sausage.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{but again this is not life. here is joy and pain. chyesnok. without these life has no flavour, is too serious. eat.}
<A>__{john nibbles some pickled garlic.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{but this vodka.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{is love. only this magic changes you inside. the moon and the stars and the sun.}
<A>__{yuri offers john the glass. he looks at nadia, takes it and swigs it down in one. he looks across at nadia, wiping his mouth, his eyes watering. she looks back at him. alexei begins softly singing a song. as he sings:}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{this is a love song, a soldier's song to his beloved alexei, he's afghanstya, a veteran of afghanistan. he saw terrible things.}
<A>__{they listen to the beautiful, sad voice. for the second verse yuri joins in, a slow stirring lament. for the end nadia joins in too and the three of them begin harmonising beautifully. john watches in the candlelight. john, nadia and alexei pose with the cake. nadia puts her arm round john and alexei. with a flash! yuri takes a polaroid. the guitar theme returns as we see the polaroid on the table in close up, developing speeded up. john comes into focus, beaming.}
