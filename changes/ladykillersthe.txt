<ACTION>__{Specifically, a garbage scow. We see it from ON HIGH, chugging down the placid but mighty Mississippi. Head credits play over COVERAGE of the garbage scow. No sound, except for an incongruously heroic score. The COVERAGE is a little rough, coarse-grained; along with the overbearing score it almost suggests an industrial film rather than a feature. One piece of sound -- the toot of the boat's horn -- is obviously library. And not a new library either. The garbage scow passes under a bridge spanning the broad, sluggish waters, and proceeds on to its landfill, a steaming river island. Disturbed gulls and other scavenger birds rise from where they were picking through trash. Their squawks, like the boat horn, are not quite believable as SYNC. The head credits end as the anthemic music resolves.}

At this, the dog lifts his nose to catch the breeze, sniffs, and then, whining, lowers his head to the floor and covers his snout with his forepaws. He huffs briefly and goes to sleep.

<ACTION>__{Pickles scurries along the walkway. We hear the toot! of an approaching scow. The cat reaches the middle of the bridge. He sticks his head through the bars of the railing. When we CUT CLOSE : on the cat as he looks down at the water, we see that he holds in his mouth a human finger. As the scow passes underneath, the cat opens its mouth and lets the finger drop. The finger falls away and is barely visible by the time it hits the scow. The cat looks up INTO THE LENS, and blinks. Its sideways irises adjust. The scow is gliding away. With the low mournful toot of its horn we tilt up the river to the great garbage island where scavenger birds pick through the trash.}
