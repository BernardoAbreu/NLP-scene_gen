<L>__{interior the bookshop day}
<A>__{it is a small shop, slightly chaotic, bookshelves everywhere, with little secret bits round corners with even more books. martin, william's sole employee, is waiting enthusiastically. he is very keen, an uncrushable optimist. perhaps without cause. a few seconds later, william stands gloomily behind the desk.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{classic. absolutely classic. profit from major sales push minus $b!r(j347.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{shall i go get a cappuccino? ease the pain.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes, better get me a half. all i can afford.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{i get your logic. demi capu coming up.}
<A>__{he salutes and bolts out the door as he does, a woman walks in. we only just glimpse her. cut to william working. he looks up casually. and sees something. his reaction is hard to read. after a pause...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<A>__{it is anna scott, the biggest movie star in the world here in his shop. the most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth. when she speaks she is very self assured and self contained.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, thanks. i will just look around.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{she wanders over to a shelf as he watches her and picks out a quite smart coffee table book.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{that book's really not good just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying. you'd be wasting your money.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes. this one though is... very good.}
<A>__{he picks up a book on the counter.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i think the man who wrote it has actually been to turkey, which helps. there's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{thanks. i will think about it.}
<A>__{william suddenly spies something odd on the small tv monitor beside him.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{if you could just give me a second.}
<A>__{her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and approaches a man in slightly ill fitting clothes.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{bad news.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{we've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{so, i saw you put that book down your trousers.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{what book?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{the one down your trousers.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{i haven't got a book down my trousers.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right well, then we have something of an impasse. i tell you what i will call the police and, what can i say? if i'm wrong about the whole book down the trousers scenario, i really apologize.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{okay what if i did have a book down my trousers?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{well, ideally, when i went back to the desk, you'd remove the cadogan guide to bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it. see you in a sec.}
<A>__{he returns to his desk. in the monitor we just glimpse, as does william, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the shelves. the thief drifts out towards the door. anna, who has observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{sorry about that...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, that's fine. i was going to steal one myself but now i've changed my mind. signed by the author, i see.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes, we couldn't stop him. if you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.}
<A>__{she smiles. suddenly the thief is there.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{can i have your autograph?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{rufus.}
<A>__{she signs his scruffy piece of paper. he tries to read it.}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{what does it say?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well, that's the signature and above, it says 'dear rufus you belong in jail.'}
<C>__{thief}
<D>__{nice one. would you like my phone number?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{tempting but... no, thank you.}
<A>__{thief leaves.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i think i will try this one.}
<A>__{she hands william a $b!r(j20 note and the book he said was rubbish. he talks as he handles the transaction.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh right on second thoughts maybe it wasn't that bad. actually it's a sort of masterpiece really. none of those childish kebab stories you get in so many travel books these days. and i will throw in one of these for free.}
<A>__{he drops in one of the signed books.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{very useful for lighting fires, wrapping fish, that sort of things.}
<A>__{she looks at him with a slight smile.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{and leaves. she's out of his life forever. william is a little dazed. seconds later martin comes back in.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{cappuccino as ordered.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{thanks. i don't think you'll believe who was just in here.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{who? someone famous?}
<A>__{but william's innate natural english discretion takes over.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no. no one no one.}
<A>__{they set about drinking their coffees.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it? do you know this is pretty incredible actually i once saw ringo starr. or at least i think it was ringo. it might have been that broke from 'fiddler on the roof,' toppy.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{topol.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{that's right topol.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{but ringo starr doesn't look anything like topol.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{no, well... he was quite a long way away.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{so it could have been neither of them?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i suppose so.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right. it's not a classic anecdotes, is it?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{not classic, no.}
<A>__{martin shakes his head. william drains his cappuccino.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right want another one?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{yes. no, wait let's go crazy i will have an orange juice.}
