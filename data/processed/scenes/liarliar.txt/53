<C>__{max}
<D>__{to who?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{max, sometimes grownups... need to lie. it's hard to explain, but if . . . look, here's an example. when mommy was pregnant with you, she gained a little weight. se venty pounds. i thought she was gonna give birth to a car. but she'd say to me "how do i lo ok?" so i'd say, "oh, honey, you're beautiful, you're glowing. otherwise, i would've hurt mommy's feeling s. understand?}
<A>__{max nods.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you didn't think she was beautiful.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{right. no... max, i don't know how to get along in the grown up world if i have to stick to the truth. i could lose my case, i could lose my promotion, i could even lose, my job... do you understand?}
<A>__{max shakes his head "no."}
<C>__{fletcher }
<D>__{will you help me anyway?}
<A>__{a moment then max reluctantly nods.}
<C>__{fletcher }
<D>__{that's my boy!}
<A>__{fletcher opens the box, revealing a cake and candles.... he takes out two birthday hats. he puts one on max and one on himself.}
<C>__{fletcher }
<D>__{now, do whatever you did last night... only this time, make an un wish.}
<A>__{not really happy, max turns to the candles on the cake. he takes a breath and blows them out.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i did it.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{great! great! now to test }
<A>__{fletcher spots an attractive female teacher. fletcher hurries to her and says something. a moment. then she}
<B>__{slaps him.}
<A>__{fletcher returns to his son.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{did it work?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(rubbing his sore cheek)}
<D>__{not like i'd hoped. did you really unwish it?}
<A>__{max nods.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{only...}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{only what?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{yesterday, when i wished it, i really meant it. this time when i unwished it i only did it 'cause you told me to.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(losing patience)}
<D>__{well, then do it again. only this time, mean it.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{fletcher}

<D>__{i explained this to you! i have to lie. everybody lies! mommy lies, even the wonderful jerry lies }
<C>__{max}

<A>__{max hesitates, then nods.}
<C>__{fletcher }
<D>__{i will see you tonight, buddy... that's a promise.}
