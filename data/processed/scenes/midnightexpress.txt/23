<A>__{hamidou, swinging his falaka stick rhythmically against his leg and that calm killer look on his face, leads an uneasy billy down a main walkway with a roof overhead; we gather that the prison contains several separate wings. administrative building hamidou glances back at billy, indicates with his stick "come here" and opens an office door. billy, still bewildered, his bruised feet almost back to normal, limps in warily eyeing hamidou who follows. necdit yesil, the lawyer, fleshy, grinning, thin black hair heavily greased, sits at a conference table. standing adjacent is stanley davis, the u.s. consul eyeglasses, striped tie, neat summer suit with stripes, trimmed hair, ivy league look, his eyes moving from billy to: older man, late 50's white hair, blue eyed new york irishman.a suburban insurance agent, rumpled suit, an anxious look on his face. moving towards billy fast:}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{billy!}
<A>__{father and son embrace; the father's left hand grabbing billy's arm tightly as if never to let go.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{dad!}
<A>__{hamidou looks on, intrigued by the father and son; leaves silently, closing the door. father looks into his son's eyes, his own eyes moistening. he looks tired, pain all over his face. billy looks down.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{dad...i'm...}
<B>__{another angle}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(voice quivering)}

<D>__{i can punch you in the nose later. right now we've got to get you out of here. you all right?}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(eyes moistening)}
<D>__{yeah. how's mom?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{bad. she couldn't make the trip. you know her boy...}
<P>__{(breaks off)}
<D>__{susan told us before we got your letter. she's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{no, don't let her! i will... how about peg? robbie?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{same. none of the neighbors know. we told them you were in a hospital in europe. oh... this is stanley davis. he's the american consul here... and necdit yesil, the lawyer you wanted...}
<B>__{another angle}
<C>__{davis}
<P>__{(shaking hands)}
<D>__{hello, billy.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{the professional smile from the consul, but in the handshake and the eye contact, billy is cool. the unanswered question: where were you before my father arrived?}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{i want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. believe me.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{thank you.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{yesil moves forward. unctuous. bubbling with high spirits, profusely shaking billy's hand, exuding confidence in fractured english,}
<C>__{yesil}
<D>__{vilyum, i am necdit yesil.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{mr. yesil.}
<C>__{yesil}
<D>__{i know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge, i arrange everything just right. and i think we get you bail. if very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... but i think we get you bail...}
<A>__{pause, billy looks at him wondering how to take him in.}
<C>__{yesil}
<P>__{(reassuringly)}
<D>__{you know i have lectured at the university of maryland in your country? also university michigan very nice country. we both go back.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(trying to concentrate)}
<D>__{if i get bail, mister yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into greece?}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(pacing up, hungry)}
<D>__{right! that's what we're shooting for. mister davis and have been in contact with the state department, but right now relations with the turks aren't too good, nixon's upset the hell out of them. our best bet's... right here.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{dad...}
<P>__{(pauses, glances at}
<D>__{davis and yesil,}
<P>__{embarrassed)}
<D>__{i will pay you back for all this, i promise.}
<B>__{another angle}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{don't worry about it. right now money doesn't count. okay?}
<A>__{a pause. yesil shifts, throats are cleared. billy moves to sit down, limping faintly; he is wearing sneakers and the bruises don't show.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{where'd you get that limp?}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(not wanting to alarm him)}
<D>__{nothing. just twisted my ankle.}
<A>__{sits down at the conference table.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{where you staying, dad?}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(pulls up a seat next to billy)}
<D>__{the hilton.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{how do you like it? istanbul?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{well, it's an interesting place...}
<P>__{(lowers his voice, a hint of a smile)}
<D>__{tell you the truth, i think the food is lousy. the crap they sell in these little restaurants. i went out to eat in one of them last night, and i had to run to the damn toilet... you shoulda' seen the toilet.}
<A>__{billy laughs.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you mean you got toilets?}
<A>__{father is happy to see his son laugh.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{yeah, with real toilet paper and you don't have to use both sides.}
<A>__{billy laughs again.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{so now i'm eating at the hilton every night.}
<A>__{billy smiles. a pause. a worried look returns to the father's face}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{why'd you do it, billy?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{for the money...}
<P>__{(looks away))}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{i know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border it was stupid, billy. stupid.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{glances at davis, yesil back to his father, his voice beginning to tremble, ashamed of himself for letting it show.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{dad get me out of here.}
<A>__{another angle. the father understands the desperation in his voice, puts his hand on his son's. father i promise you, billy. just sit tight and don't.. don't do anything stupid. let me work with mr. yesil and mr. davis. we'll get you out... okay? billy, okay? all the assurance of the world is written in this kindly irishman's face. billy feels it. billy being led by two guards down a huge arched corridor in the courtroom building.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{okay.}
