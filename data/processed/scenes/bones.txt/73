<L>__{interior bones' building later that day}
<A>__{in bones' old room, patrick rolls over the faded stained old shag carpet with a huge carpet cleaner.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{the transparent tubes of the cleaner fill with disgusting red fluid and carpet fibers.}
<T>__{time cut to:}
<A>__{patrick stands back and surveys his work. the carpet looks perfect. old, a little faded, but clean. no stains. with a smile of satisfaction he rolls the cleaner out of the room and closes the door behind him. we remain in the room.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{the now clean carpet. suddenly we see glutinous red liquid seeping back up through the shag, until the stain is right where it was. wet and fresh. then we see it spread and move, in the shape of a body and the path by which it was dragged out of the room. the door opens again, and patrick steps in to show off the freshly painted room clean rug to cinnabar and the others. he's brought up short by the sight of the stain.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{must be something seeping through. from the floor.}
<A>__{they roll the carpet back, thinking there must be something on the floor. the floor beneath the carpet is wet too, but can't tell if it's from the rug or vice versa. he puts his hand down on the wood. a low rhythmic rumbling.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{do you feel that?}
<A>__{the others place their hands on the floor.}
<C>__{tia}
<D>__{yeah. it's. throbbing.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{like a heartbeat.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{"like a heartbeat like a love beat." listen to the di franco twins there. just the plumbing or something, fool.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor. it leaked and stained.}
<A>__{they just look at him.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{you got a better explanation}
