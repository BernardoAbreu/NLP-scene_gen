<A>__{ginger scrabbles pathetically for a grip on the tile floor as she pulls herself into the bathroom. she clutches the rim of the toilet. low angle past her, on terminator, as he stands behind her. pan up, off her. he takes aim. and empties the clip. he calmly reloads.}

<L>__{interior hallway bedroom}
<A>__{close on phone machine, as the telephone rings loudly in the ensuing silence. terminator spins, drawing an instantaneous bead on the source of the sound, but doesn't fire.}

<P>__{(recorded)}
<D>__{hi there.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{ha ha ha, fooled you. you're talking to a machine...}
<A>__{c.u. terminator, motionless, listening.}
<C>__{ginger's voice}
<P>__{(recorded, continuing)}
<D>__{...but don't be shy, it's okay. machines need love too...}
<A>__{terminator turns abruptly back to ginger's body. he turns it over, assuring himself that she is dead.}

<P>__{(continuing, recorded)}
<D>__{...so talk to it and ginger, that's me, or sarah will get back to you. wait for the beep.}
<A>__{there is a loud tone and the incoming call is heard.}
<C>__{sarah's voice}
<P>__{(on machine)}
<D>__{ginger, this is sarah...}
<A>__{terminator's head snaps back and he freezes, listening. he rises slowly as sarah's voice continues.}
<B>__{tight on his unblinking eyes.}
<C>__{sarah's voice}
<P>__{(on machine, contin uing)}
<D>__{...i'm in this sleazy bar called stoker's on pico but i'm too scared to leave. i'm really scared, kiddo...}
