<A>__{out of black we hear the sound of an airplane roaring by.}
<L>__{exterior pov of an airplane}
<A>__{flying over american heartland. we see the earth through the pilot's perspective as sky and ground swap positions, the plane swooping down and storming over the ground.}
<B>__{the plane}
<A>__{is a biplane, racing over a field lush with young plants. it releases a trail of crop spray, and climbs again... up into a crystalline blue sky where sunshine pours like honey over family farms stretching to the horizon. maybe it's not heaven, maybe it's just tennessee. but as long as there's been an america, men have fought and died for this place as volunteers. far off, but visible from the plane is a barn day the barn is unpainted except for hand lettering that says "mccawley crop dusting." another plane noise, this one made by kids, brings us to two boys, sitting in the shell of an old plane propped on crates, scavenged of it's engine, seats, and wheels. the boys sit in it's cockpit, butts crowded onto the nail keg they've replaced the seat with. they've even attached a 2x4 as propeller, as if their imaginations needed any help. they wear overalls and have bowl haircuts: rafe and danny, 10 years old.}

<A>__{they buzz their lips in a flying noise and work the controls, rafe's bare feet on one pedal, danny's on the other.}

<D>__{kill the bastards!}
<A>__{rafe looks at danny in shock then they both laugh and go right back into their game, manufacturing their own machine gun and engine sounds.}

<D>__{there's another one!}
<A>__{their vocal motors roar again... but a man's hand grabs danny by the straps of his overalls and jerks him from the cockpit. it's danny's father and he's a fearsome sight; drunk, his hair uncombed, his face unshaven, his teeth those still left are rotting. he's also missing an arm; but the one that's left is potent, and he's shaking danny with it.}
<C>__{danny's father}
<D>__{you no count boy! johnson come lookin', said he'd pay a dime for you to shovel his pig shed, and i can't find you no place.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{daddy, i told you i was comin' here.}
<A>__{his father slaps him off his feet. rafe is so horrified he can't get a sound out. danny isn't even surprised. but when his father snatches him up again, twisting the overall straps so tight they choke him, he struggles. it does no good; his father starts marching across the field, dragging and strangling danny.}
