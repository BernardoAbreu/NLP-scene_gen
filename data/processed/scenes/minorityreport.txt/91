<A>__{anderson sits in his chair. he cocks his head, listening. his body tenses. something feels wrong. the timer shows ten minutes to go. blindfolded for a day and a night, anderson has no idea how much time he has left. three seconds, four hours? a flattened spider squeezes under his door. anderson tenses as it clicks across the floor toward him. he knows that sound. anderson stumbles up and out of his chair. he starts to grab at his dressings, remembers doc's warning, and stops himself. the spider waits for him to settle, then clicks toward him again. anderson moves around the room, avoiding the spider. he is dripping with sweat, starting to breathe hard. the spider comes faster. anderson crashes into a table, brings it down. falls across the bed.}
