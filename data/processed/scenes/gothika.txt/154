<L>__{interior cafeteria moments later}
<A>__{the door crashes open and chloe shoves the sheriff inside. she has a gun pressed hard against his ear.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{young lady, i don't know how you think you can get out of here, but }
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{you're very polite for a piggy. now take off your uniform.}
<A>__{sheriff ryan hesitates. chloe presses the gun against him.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{do it quick. i won't make fun of you.}
<A>__{the sound of the upstairs door being thrown open makes her glance up. she trains her flashlight at the second level, stepping behind the sheriff to use him as cover.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{nobody better fucking move up there or i will blow this piggy's head off!}
<A>__{her flashlight beam searches the section. catches the reflection of a police shield hiding behind a table.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{that means you, fucko. up on your feet or i will start by shooting his ear off.}
<A>__{a beat. officer turlington rises. slow and deliberate.}
<C>__{chloe}
<P>__{(to sheriff, sotto)}
<D>__{tell junior the grownups are talking now and he's not allowed in here. do it.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{turlington, it's alright. i can i'm just going to }
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{the grownups are talking. don't paraphrase me.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{the grownups are are talking now. just leave.}
<A>__{a voice startles chloe from behind, at floor level.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{chloe? can i talk to you?}
<A>__{chloe flicks the flashlight to see miranda by the door.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{dreadful timing, i'm real busy.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you have to let him go. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{chloe flinches at that. like all this multitasking is affecting her. she digs the gun deeper into the sheriff's neck, making him cower to his knees, execution style }
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{look let's not confuse things. i like you. but this is my only chance.}
<P>__{(to sheriff)}
<D>__{now take off that goddamn uniform before i get really pissed.}
<A>__{the sheriff glances at miranda. miranda nods. the sheriff begins unbuttoning his shirt }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what are you going to do? put on his uniform and walk out of here? think about it, chloe. they know you have him. the place is crawling with cops.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{what are my options? to grow old in this place? it's clear they will never let me go. never. ever.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{that's not true. you have less than a year left here.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{that's a lie! i will never stop being sick, they'll just find something new that's wrong with me. no wonder you doctors can't help anyone all you have are deficit columns and stupid tests designed to point out what part of the puzzle you think we're missing!}
<A>__{she starts sobbing. letting everything go }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you're right, doctors never concentrate on the things patients are actually capable of. but i know you, chloe, you've been through things that most people don't survive. and you have a wonderful future in front of you if you choose it. it's up to you.}
<A>__{this gets through to chloe. her grip loosens on the gun.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{no more guilt, no more hatred, no more unbearable sadness. you have no use for any of that anymore. your life begins this very second.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{i'm so tired. so goddamn tired }
<A>__{miranda walks over and embraces her. chloe hands her the gun. and that's when the power returns. miranda and chloe frozen in their embrace. sheriff ryan on his knees. in the sudden, shocking glare of returning light, color abruptly re enters the world and every radio, phone, fan and machine that were left on hum to}
<B>__{life.}
<A>__{miranda finds herself staring at sheriff ryan, bathed in the glow of the flashing red and blue lights from the cruisers outside. the image a replica of the andrea white and jenny dixon visions. peeking from his half unbuttoned shirt is the beginning of a chest tattoo. miranda slowly trains the gun on the sheriff, finally struck with the realization:}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{it was you, wasn't it?}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{she opens his shirt to reveal the tattoo: a 1950s pinup style woman surrounded by flames, arms raised, shackled. anima sola. miranda's recurring vision from the night of the slaughter.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{'not alone.' that's what rachel has been trying to tell me all along. doug was not alone. you were with him. this whole time it's been you. you covered up their deaths to look like suicides.}
<A>__{the sheriff throws his jacket on, starts walking }
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{you've lost your mind.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{don't fucking move.}
<A>__{the click! of a safety being released makes him pause. he turns to look at her. a tense beat.}
<C>__{pete }
<D>__{miranda, don't do it!}
<A>__{she glances at pete's pleading face and the room around her: cops everywhere. all guns trained on her. sheriff ryan speaks low so only she can hear the following:}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{and just exactly who would believe you? no proof, no living witness. everybody knows you're crazy.}
<A>__{miranda's finger itches on the trigger as they face off. her hand starts to shake. sheriff ryan turns and strides off. getting away. further. further... but as much as she wants to, she can't bring herself to do it. finally brings the gun down. the armed policemen rush over and disarm her, shove her to the floor and cuff her.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{i want that woman in custody. she has a judge to face in the morning.}
