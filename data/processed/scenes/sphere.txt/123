<D>__{i don't want you talking to jerry.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{but sir, i think it's imperative. i think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed edmunds, the reading you got earlier i think they're all related.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{jerry isn't hostile, norman. he said earlier we were his friends }
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{of course he did. he's been isloated for 400 years. he wants someone to talk to. look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic. we're talking about 400 years here. an alien that shows emotional responses. i think we need to address him, before he reacts further.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{you think he killed edmunds?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{yes, i do. whatever's out there, i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{bullshit. what's out there isn't alien. it's an animal.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{maybe so. but i think we need to ask jerry about it.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{no. i think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat. he might be listening now.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i think he already is.}
<A>__{they turn to the monitors: on the monitor: "do not ignore me"}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{nice work, captain sir.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{shut up, beth. i don't want to hear it.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{jerry, we don't want to ignore you.}
<A>__{"don't underestimate my power"}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{we don't.}
<A>__{"yes you do"}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{jerry }
<A>__{the monitor blinks back we see the sphere. it is closed. still. we hear the sensor: pong. pong. pong.}
