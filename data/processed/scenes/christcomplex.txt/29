<L>__{interior quinn's room moments later}
<A>__{quinn opens the door to his room and spies a silhouette in the far corner.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{where have you been?}
<A>__{the silhouette comes out of the darkness and into view. it should come to no surprise that louis is emerging from the darkness.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{you've been waiting long?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{no i figured you were on your way back }
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{ because you are spying on me again? so i don't need to tell you where i've been.}
<A>__{louis sits down on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{who's the girl?}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{it's started again. you're already jealous. you are going to do the same thing you did during the war...you're going to sabotage this.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i'm insulted frankly.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{don't you play that game. you are being facetious.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{no, i'm being serious. you care about the girl, it's obvious. not in a friendship or i'm curious about human behavior way.}
<A>__{quinn sits down beside him.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{so why are you here?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{have you told her?}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{who i am? of course not!}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{quinn you only have a few days left and you care for this girl }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ what's the harm in telling her?}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{there's a lot of harm in telling her.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{if this is real and you really care for this girl, you have to tell her. it's only fair to her.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{she has a best friend who is very guarded of me...it's odd she eluded to the same thing. you know the whole "i'm hiding something, and i need to come out into the open" thing.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{sounds to me like she is right.}
<A>__{quinn gets up and walks to the door.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{well i better do this now then.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yeah you don't want to lose your nerve.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{can you let yourself out?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{quinn slowly opens the door and walks out. the door creeps shut behind him. louis smiles to himself, feeling satisfaction. his face looks evil, almost demonic.}
