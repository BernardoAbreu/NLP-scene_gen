<B>__{close on}
<A>__{the nose cone of a titan missile, its 20 megaton nuclear warhead wrapped in the steel re entry shell. cold, silent, fearsome.}
<C>__{general taylor }
<D>__{mr. president, the orders were limited to our strategic forces in the continental u.s.}
<L>__{interior oval office continuous}
<A>__{taylor continues on.}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{technically, general lemay is correct that sac has the statutory authority }
<A>__{the president punches his desk.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{ i have the authority. i am the commander in chief of the united states, and i say when we go to war!}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{we are not at war, sir, not until we're at defcon 1.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{general, the joint chiefs have just signalled our intent to escalate to the soviets. you have signalled an escalation which i had no wish to signal, and which i did not approve.}
<A>__{but taylor knows this very well. and the way he's suffering, it's clear he's taking the heat for his underlings. from over on the couch bobby chimes in:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{lemay... he's history.}
<A>__{the president glances at kenny who stands there, speechless.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{get out of here, max.}
<A>__{the general leaves. kenny closes the door, wanders deeper into the office. he looks from the president to bobby. there's a long, long beat of shocked silence.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{jesus...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{rescind the order. can all the chiefs. put nitze, gilpatric and the undersecretaries in charge.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{we can't do that, bobby.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{he's right, we can't rescind defcon 2. the soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{and we can't purge the chiefs. our invasion talk will look like a bluff. or even that there's been an attempted coup.}
<A>__{bobby is disgusted, but knows they're right.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{mcnamara won't be able to handle them. it's too much for one man...}
<P>__{(knowing look to kenny)}
<D>__{...with all due respect to our heroic fifth column.}
<A>__{the president collapses in his rocking chair. kenny leans over the back of the sofa next to bobby.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{we've got khruschev's attention with the blockade. if we want a political solution. i think it's time to turn up the diplomatic heat. cause if we let this go on too long, we're going to find ourselves in a war.}
<A>__{bobby looks at the president, meaningful. the president turns to kenny.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{i've been considering a variation on one of stevenson's ideas. we're going to send up a trial balloon through lippman. the jupiter missiles.}
