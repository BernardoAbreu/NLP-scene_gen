<A>__{suddenly a rush of sea water shoots straight under the raised crate of the piano wetting her shoes. ada stands, pushing flora onto her feet. she is aghast to see the tide has crept in completely unnoticed. they watch three of their boxes float out to sea. one of the hens has escaped the crate and is bobbing up and down in the waves. scene 13 deleted sc 14 exterior beach dusk sc 14 there is just a pink streak left in the sky. ada and flora shelter inside their make shift tent, a hooped petticoat secured at the edges with stones. inside the tent a candle lights up their conversation. ada is hand signaling a story to flora who lies back watching, nervous and afraid. ada's whole self is involved in the "telling", her face is alight with expression, now tender, now sad, now humorous, now soft, while her hands and fingers are deft and precise. from outside it is an odd shadow play.}

<A>__{sc 15 exterior bush on way to beach day sc 15 through a dense bush walk a party of fourteen maori people and two european men. the wetness, closeness and darkness of the bush is such that the air seems green, like at the bottom of a deep sea. two of the maoris share one pair of shoes and all of them are clothed in a mixture of native and european costume. of the europeans one is small and has a shy manner. he has a half completed maori tattoo across his cheeks. the other is a similar age about 45 and wears a suit, muddy and out of place here in the bush. he staggers, spurts forward then slows to a stop. his hair and face are wet and his skin reflects the green foliage. baines the younger man turns and slows.}
