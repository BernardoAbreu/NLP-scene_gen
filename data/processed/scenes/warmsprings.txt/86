<A>__{fred lays in franklin's bed while franklin sits by the bedside. roy lays a cold compress on fred's forehead. franklin is using his watch to take fred's pulse. roy pulls back the sheet to give fred air revealing his withered legs. alabaster skin stretched over bones. franklin looks away.}
<L>__{interior cottage day}
<A>__{franklin sits at a card table with his check book in front of him. tom stands before him, shifting uncomfortably.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{how many can pay?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{fewer than half.}
<A>__{franklin opens the check book and begins writing.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i want these people in the cottages, not in the inn. it's safer.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well, it's the way it has to be.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i've already had some complaints.}
<P>__{(awkwardly)}
<D>__{this is the start of the season, franklin. i've got regulars who have come for years. healthy folks over all... they're threatening to check out, afraid they might catch polio.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{such ignorance! don't they know that after the fever breaks we are no longer contagious?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i'm going to have to ask that you not use the pool during regular hours. i will put time aside for you late in the day... and it won't be possible for you to eat in the dining room either. but i promise i will find someplace suitable.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{they don't want us to eat in their presence?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{of course for you i can make other accommodations.}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{that won't be necessary.}
<A>__{franklin goes back to writing out the check. tom stands waiting, the sound of the pen scratching seemingly interminable. their mutual discomfort is obvious. franklin rips the check from the ledger and holds it for tom.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{we still need a doctor here.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{for fred?}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{for everyone.}
