<L>__{interior mess hall tables day}
<A>__{rudy and nick sit at a cafeteria table. beside rudy is a frail, nervous, fiftyish inmate, zook. zook sits alone, talks to no one, always has the shakes.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to motor city for new year's. she says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? i'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no, i'm through with that shit. ashley's right. gotta start doing something i got a stake in. get a business going.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i don't know, i've seen the business world.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hotwiring cars, rudy, does not qualify as a small business. chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.}
<A>__{rudy shrugs. he checks across the room, on the whereabouts of the alamo. the big indian has his back turned.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{ashley's talking about maybe we can start something up together...}
<A>__{next to rudy, zook has stopped eating. he is still as stone, staring at his tray.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{whatsa matter, zook?}
<A>__{they both watch zook put down his utensils and reach into his red and green jello with his bare hand.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{the hell you doing, zookerman?}
<A>__{gloppy gelatin drips from his hand, as the frail man lifts a large black cockroach out. zook's shaking.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{just a roach, zook.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{good for you. protein.}
<C>__{zook}
<D>__{monsters in the gelatin...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's a roach, guy }
<C>__{zook}
<D>__{there are monsters...}
<P>__{(voice rising)}
<D>__{...in the gelatin...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh, man }
<A>__{zook stands up, holding jello aloft:}
<C>__{zook}
<D>__{there are monsters in the gelatin!}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{fuckin, zookerman }
<C>__{zook}
<D>__{there are monsters! in the gelatin! there are monsters! in the gelatin!}
<A>__{a grumbling murmur sweeps through the cafeteria as inmates sift through their jello, searching for }
<C>__{distant inmate}
<D>__{sonofabitch!}
<A>__{he pulls something bug like out of his dessert, holds it aloft, and then hurls it at the cafeteria line. a staffer ducks away. the inmates laugh and suddenly they're all on their feet }
<C>__{zook}
<D>__{there are monsters! in the gelatin!}
<A>__{ grabbing handfuls of jello and throwing it at the cafeteria line. inmates get errantly splashed, and respond by wheeling on their fellow inmates red and green globs flying to and fro!}
<C>__{guards}
<D>__{sit down! sit the fuck back down!}
<A>__{as guards immediately rush in to restore order }
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{rudy, don't move }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{two days, we got two days! don't do nothing. don't touch nothing }
<A>__{an inmate at the end of their table picks up their table and overturns it, sending food flying. rudy and nick stand back, hands raised in surrender. jello hits rudy in the face.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{don't move, rudy!}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{standing right here, man!}
<A>__{zook is still shouting until a guard clubs him senseless with a blackjack. whistles are blowing. guards scream for order.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(as a guard eyes them)}
<D>__{ate the jello, jello was fine!}
<A>__{the guard leaves them alone, runs on. the melee's still out of control. as rudy turns and suddenly sees the alamo charging across the room, with murderous eyes, a metal shank in his hand! five feet away!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{rudy, look out!}
<A>__{nick grabs him, trying to push him out of the way and the alamo's shank plunges deep into nick's stomach burying between his ribs. blood splashes. nick slumps.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{nick!}
<A>__{the alamo pulls the blade out with a ferocious yell, pushes nick to the floor and spins on rudy! rudy blocks with a chair, stumbling back, cartwheeling over a table as the alamo roars over him for the kill and two guards tackle the big indian out of nowhere! knocking the knife away, hammering him with blackjacks. it takes another three guards to keep the alamo down. rudy scrambles across the floor. nick's on his back, blood pumping freely from his gut }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{guard! guard!}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(in shock)}
<D>__{alamo...}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{guard!!!}
<A>__{no one's helping, the guards nearby all subduing the alamo. nick grabs rudy's shirt, gasping to speak }
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{jesus, rudy }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{take it, man! you're all right! hold it in! guard!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh, fuck, rudy... oh jesus...}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{guard!!!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{ash... ashley...}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{no, man! no, no, no!}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(choking)}
<D>__{tell her... i will be there ...}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you're gonna be there! we're getting outta here! take it!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{tell ashley... i...}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you tell her!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{...be with her...}
<A>__{blood spills out nick's mouth. his eyes go vacant.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{no!!!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{...for christmas...}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{nick!!!}
<A>__{and rudy's suddenly hauled backwards. a trio of guards descend, grabbing nick's body as his life fades away. dragging his figure out of the melee. whistles are blowing.}
<C>__{guards}
<D>__{get him out of here! lock down!}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{nick!!!}
<A>__{rudy struggles, enraged, and gets blackjacked across the skull for his trouble. he hits the jello covered floor. and the world goes dark.}
