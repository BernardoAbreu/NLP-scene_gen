<L>__{interior captain's control room dusk}
<A>__{the captain sees some sort of whirlpool sucking water down into a hole. the ship begins to slowly turn toward the hole, being sucked in.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{oh, my god!}
<A>__{passengers rush over to the starboard railing where a robot emerges from the whirlpool. woosh!!! hundreds of gallons of water are tossed up with the robot. the water in the air turns to snow as it falls on the ship. the robot's engines howl in the air.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(fearing danger to his son) robbie!!!}
<A>__{the robot's claws begin pushing the ship making it lean to one side and finally tip over on it's side. robbie is already running towards ray. at the turn of the ship, the three go into the water. cars start coming towards them. woosh!!! a car comes right for them. splash!!! the car hit's the water where they are, instantly pinning robbie and ray to the front of it. rachel is holding on to robbie's back, also going down. the people in the car are screaming as the car fills with water. as the ship completely capsizes, people are thrown or washed into the water. cars sink down, people float and the ship bobs in the water. ray is able to un pin himself and pulls robbie out. they all begin swimming to the surface. rachel lags behind and robbie grabs her and helps her up. at the surface, they meet. a ship propeller at full power. they begin to swim away from it. claws from the ship over head are grabbing people and pulling them into the robot's holds.}
