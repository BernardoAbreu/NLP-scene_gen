<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{you drive well for somebody who hasn't done it in five years.}
<A>__{he ignores her as they get out of the car.}

<D>__{learn anything from lindenmeyer's file?}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{he had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. all he did day and night was play the violin.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what happened when he was 17?}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.}

<C>__{undercover}
<D>__{not until somebody gets a search warrant signed. it's sunday. i don't think they've even found a judge, yet.}

<D>__{so will i...}
<A>__{inside lindenmeyer's duplex madison races through the broken front door to find parker checking his weapon. before she can speak, he motions for madison to freeze and be silent. parker hears something. something moving inside the duplex. his every movement is now that of a predator. madison awkwardly removes her own weapon from her purse. she does not handle it with confidence. parker shakes his head.}
<C>__{madison}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you've got a problem with me carrying a gun?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{do me one favor if you shoot at anything, make sure i'm nowhere near it.}
<A>__{parker bolts through the duplex, storming into rooms furiously. his movements are aggressive. madison searches other rooms methodically. she is not timid. just inexperienced in the field. she passes a video camera mounted on a tripod. pointed out the window at a neighbor's bathroom. dozens of cassettes surround the tripod. the labels are dated covering every day of the last month. parker and madison enter opposite sides of the kitchen with their guns drawn, nearly shooting each other. madison puts down her gun. parker does not. the noise persists.}

<P>__{(looking through his sight)}
<D>__{bang...}
<A>__{he smiles wickedly, and continues on. madison takes a deep breath, then resumes her search. parker and madison end up inside lindenmeyer's home office it's as if the information superhighway ended in here. cluttered stockpiles of hardware and software: computers, books, folders, disks, and tapes. what you notice, however, is that all the data relates to different kinds of criminals: serial killers, mass murderers, terrorists, kidnappers, rapists, bombers, extortionists, anarchists, you name it, it's here. the psychology of, the methodology of, the history of, the encyclopedia of, the autobiographies of human villainy. classical music and lifelike sound effects can be heard coming from a computer. this is what parker has been hearing. he holsters his sidearm. so does madison. who checks her pulse.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{madison}
<P>__{(clinically)}
<D>__{checking my pulse. it's elevated.}

<D>__{you've studied me, now i'm studying you. seems only fair, don't you think?}
<B>__{on the computer monitor}
<A>__{an animated man, who resembles lindenmeyer, walks peacefully through a park. he then starts killing everything in sight. men, women, squirrels, even flowers. all to classical music. the scene immediately starts over, with the man once again walking peacefully through the park. this was lindenmeyer's}

<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(looking at a book shelf)}
<D>__{maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...}
<A>__{he runs his finger along a book shelf, pausing at two books in particular. their titles are: understanding the criminal mind, and criminal pursuit a psychological guide for law enforcement. they were written by dr. madison carter.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{i'm surprised you didn't write one about me.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{i'm still working on it.}
<A>__{noticing something on the floor, she picks up a bizarre looking synthesizer keyboard off the floor. you read its name: maestro.}

<C>__{madison}
<D>__{the government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...}
<A>__{madison elects not to respond. she sits down at the computer, which rests between busts of beethoven and mozart, and begins typing at the computer. she works with efficiency. knowing exactly what she's doing. she is now in her element. from a shelf, parker picks up a moldy piece of licorice inserted into a half eaten pudding cup. then flips through one of the books written by madison. only half interested.}

<P>__{(pointing to the screen)}
<D>__{he's part of the mix. sid 6.7 is a composite.}
<B>__{on the computer screen}
<A>__{the graphics show you that sid 1.2 was a combination of charles manson and billy the kid. you see what look like two viruses, which represent each criminal's psychological profile, attacking each other. the result is a molten blob. berkowitz was added to create sid 1.3. a three way psychological battle, more hostile than the first, occurs. sid 1.4, adding the terrorist, abu nidal, makes the conflict even more violent. and so on. inside lindenmeyer's office madison stares at the computer screen in awe. parker flips through cd rom hard copies of the different versions of sid.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(understanding)}
<D>__{creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{but rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.}
<A>__{she continues opening the files of the higher versions of sid. version 5.9 consists of 67 different profiles. the visualized psychological battle is intense. and extremely violent. the 6.7 version, with 183 profiles, is even worse.}
<C>__{madison }
<D>__{it's a good bet a couple of the dominant personalities teamed up to overpower the others.}
<P>__{(a beat)}

<C>__{parker}
<D>__{this is getting you pumped up, isn't it? this is like the world series to you.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, it is.}
