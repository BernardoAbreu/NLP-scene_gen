<D>__{draw swords!}
<A>__{the men draw their sabres in silence. the birds chirping, oblivious. then nicholls just turns to his two friends and almost whispers...}

<A>__{the men start to float over the grass swept along by their invisible horses, until... suddenly they emerge from the tall grass the immense power of the galloping horses silence explodes into a violent crashing of hooves. the noise is immense, swords are flying in the air. hundreds of horses racing towards the german encampment. on the german side, two soldiers wake to the sound of hoofbeats. they pull their tent flap aside to find the invincible charge coming towards them. the germans are totally unprepared. we see them scramble back towards tents, rush towards their guns one man pulling up his trousers rushes for cover. one german drops some dirty dishes into a wash pot, screaming:}

<D>__{charge!}
<A>__{the british head in for the kill, the men scream battle cries with sheer exhilaration. we see the horses at close quarters running with all their might. nicholls and stewart yell as they approach the enemy. the surprise attack is a huge success. the first row of unprepared germans are falling... the regiment sweeps through the encampment, cutting down soldiers and driving the rest in a panicked retreat to the tree line. but then we see, in the shadows of the forest behind the}

<A>__{a machine gun. no, a line of machine guns at least twenty guns, sandbagged apart the logical, new, modern defence of a garrison. in an instant, the fleeing germans have manned the guns. all now firing. the noise of the blast of bullets drowns out everything else. a score of men and horses are suddenly on the ground, it happens almost so quickly joey and topthorn don't realize anything's wrong and find themselves racing straight towards the guns. the bullets keep coming, now suddenly half of the regiment are on the ground. horse after horse races past the guns into the woods...all of them now riderless. nicholls watches helplessly as one of the barrels swings towards him. his face goes slack as he realizes he is about to die. a moment later, joey runs on we pan up to see he is running on riderless he has not realized that nicholls is gone. the bullets whizz around his head, but he still runs directly ahead. we would always know him by the red pennant nicholls tied on his saddle. joey is now running through the german lines. no one bothers to attack him as the german's concentrate their efforts on the cavalry behind him. the line of machine guns fire as one, decimating the horses and their riders. joey leaps and dances nimbly through the german ranks, but suddenly rears up in the confusion, surrounded by germans. near him, surviving english officers are hauled from their horses. stewart wheels back around on topthorn, sabre in hand. but he, too, is quickly surrounded by several germans with their rifles trained on him. a furious german officer storms over, speaks perfect english:}
