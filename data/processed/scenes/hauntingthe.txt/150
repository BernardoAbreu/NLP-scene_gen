<L>__{exterior main gate night}
<A>__{marrow hurries around the back of the car, staying clear of the lake of gas spreading about it. luke rolls off. marrow helps him up, and gets him away a safe distance.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i'm okay. okay. just my chest. just my wind knocked out.}
<A>__{marrow looks up at the gate. it is even more impassible than before with the gasoline saturated wreck in it. no way to try another break out either.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{sorry about your car, nell.}
<A>__{he turns around. the others do too. no nell. luke and theo look up. mute dread. no nell anywhere.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{oh, no.}
