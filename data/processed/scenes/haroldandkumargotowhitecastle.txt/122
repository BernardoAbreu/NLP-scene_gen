<L>__{exterior krispee kreme donuts}
<D>__{harold and kumar walk over to the parking lot. unfortunately, they notice a familiar yellow jeep covered in stickers.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{oh great. here we go again. cole and the extreme sports punks are hacky sacking in the parking lot. their skateboards are sitting nearby.}
<C>__{cole }

<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(to rold)}
<D>__{fucking asshole. suddenly, harold stops in his tracks. he's noticed something through the krispee kreme window. he stops kumar and points...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{look! through the window, we see rosenberg and goldstein inside, sitting at a booth. they both have a dozen donuts and five cartons of milk. it looks like they just sat down... goldstein savors his first bite of his powdered blueberry filled donut and rosenberg licks his fingers after his first bite of his chocolate cream filled donut. harold and kumar watch through the window longingly...}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(yearning)}
<D>__{i want that.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{what? a chocolate cream filled?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{no. i want that feeling.}
<P>__{(beat)}

<D>__{i need that feeling.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{are you saying what i think you're saying?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{we gotta go to white castle.}
<A>__{kumar gives harold a hug.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{yes! i knew you had it in you!}
<A>__{suddenly, kumar notices something else inside. someone else is sitting down at rosenberg & goldstein's table...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{is that cindy kim?}
<A>__{harold watches as cindy kim sits down next to goldstein. goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of donut. it looks like goldstein and cindy are "an item."}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{you should have boned her when you had the chance.}
<A>__{before harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head by a hacky sack! cole and the punks laugh at harold.}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(to cole)}
<D>__{hey, why don't you just leave us alone?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{oh yeah? what are you gonna do about it, mr. miagi?}
<A>__{cole gets in the crane position a la the karate kid... harold is quiet for a moment as he looks at cole's little racist routine. he then lets out a little laugh...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{harold turns around and starts walking towards the krispee kreme entrance. kumar follows. in the background cole and the punks are laughing about what a "pussy" harold is.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(pissed off, but powerless)}
<D>__{fuck! i'm so sick of their bullshit!}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(totally calm)}
<D>__{don't worry. the universe tends to unfold as it should.}
<A>__{kumar gives a "what the fuck is he talking about?" look.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{besides, i have a plan. follow my lead...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{your lead?}
<A>__{harold walks past the krispee kreme entrance and heads towards the yellow jeep at a brisk pace. kumar follows. suddenly, harold snatches cole's keys from the hood of the jeep and rushes inside the driver's side. one of the extreme sports punks sees harold doing this...}
<D>__{extreme sports punk #1 hey, cole! look!}
<A>__{cole turns to see harold in his car. kumar is about to get in the passenger's side. cole and the punks start running towards the car! kumar sees this and quickly gets inside. harold puts the car in reverse, nearly hitting the punks.}
