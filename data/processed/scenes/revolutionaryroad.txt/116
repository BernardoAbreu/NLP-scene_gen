<A>__{a toyland of white and pastel houses along the road. the crisp green lawns. the blue televisions flickering behind the glass. we hear the whisk of running footsteps on the asphalt, the rush of a man's breath... frank is running down the middle of the street, tears streaming silently down his face...}
<L>__{interior campbell living room evening, one year later.}
<A>__{four high ball glasses with glistening cubes of ice. shep puts the finishing touches on four drinks. mr. and mrs. brace, a pleasant looking young couple fresh from the city sit on the couch.}

<D>__{...it was the worst experience of my life. such wonderful people. weren't they shep? poor april.}
<A>__{shep picks up the drinks and carries them across the room. he stands there beside the three of them, but he can't bring himself to sit down and join in.}
