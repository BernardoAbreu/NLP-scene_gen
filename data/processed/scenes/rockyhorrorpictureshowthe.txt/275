<L>__{interior ballroom night}
<A>__{magenta who during all this has been filing her nails, looks up at frank who is in an attitude of supplication.}
<C>__{magenta}
<D>__{how sentimental.}
<A>__{riff raff moves slowly to the stage.}
<C>__{riff raff}
<D>__{and also presumptuous of you. you see when i said "we" were to return to transylvania, i referred only to magenta and myself.}
<A>__{frank looks appalled. the guests are deeply troubled, realising that they also are not part of the "we".}
<C>__{riff raff}
<D>__{you see, you are to remain here, in spirit anyway.}
<A>__{he produces a ray gun.}
<C>__{dr scott}
<D>__{great heavens, that's a laser.}
<C>__{riff raff}
<D>__{yes, dr scott. a laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti matter.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{you mean you're going to kill him? what's his crime?}
<C>__{dr scott}
<D>__{you saw what became of eddie. society must be protected.}
<C>__{riff raff}
<D>__{exactly, dr scott. now frank n. furter, your time has come. say goodbye to all this and hello to oblivion.}
<A>__{frank raises himself to his full height.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{do your worse inferior one.}
<A>__{as riff raff pulls the trigger, columbia dashes between them. she is killed instantly. riff raff fires again at frank. frank takes a leap fro the rope on the curtain. the entire proscenium crashes under the weight. and frank is crushed to death among the velvet and glittered facia. rocky breaks down completely. although he despised frank, he was all he had in the world. he rushes to the body and cradles it in his arms. riff raff can stand no more. he fires a blast of laser beam at rocky who starts climbing the stairway towards the fox skyline. riff raff fires again and again. with the body of frank in his arms, rocky beats on his chest and lets out a wild sound like a giant beast of the jungle. riff raff fires a sustained beam. rocky climbs to the top of the fox sculpture. riff raff fires again and again. they crash to their deaths.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{good god.}
<C>__{riff raff}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{you've killed them.}
<A>__{magenta has found the entire sequence of events quite distasteful.}
<C>__{magenta}
<D>__{i thought you liked them. they liked you.}
<C>__{riff raff}
<D>__{they didn't like me. they never liked me.}
<C>__{dr scott}
<P>__{(he tries a calming hand)}
<D>__{you did right.}
<C>__{riff raff}
<D>__{a decision had to be made.}
<C>__{dr scott}
<P>__{(the big sell out)}
<D>__{you're ok by me.}
<C>__{riff raff}
<D>__{dr scott i'm sorry about your nephew.}
<C>__{dr scott}
<D>__{yes, well perhaps it was for the best.}
<C>__{riff raff}
<D>__{you must leave now dr scott while it's still possible. we are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of transylvania. go now.}
<A>__{the guests flee down the ballroom and out the door. we see the laughing figures of riff raff and magenta making a special sign to each other.}
