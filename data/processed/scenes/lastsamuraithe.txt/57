<L>__{interior katsumoto's house night}
<A>__{katsumoto is arranging flowers. algren watches in confusion, as this powerful lord goes about doing something so feminine and delicate. finally:}
<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{the parliament of your country has two houses. why is that?}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{to keep either one from being too powerful.}
<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{does not a people need a powerful ruler to protect them?}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{we believe the opposite.}
<A>__{katsumoto thinks about this.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{i have a question. how do you come to speak english?}
<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{members of the council were required to study}
<A>__{............ it. ........yes, i was a member of the government.}
<D>__{i helped restore the emperor to the throne.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{so that japan could have a powerful ruler to protect it.}
<A>__{katsumoto understands algren's irony, but doesn't smile.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{and now you must hate him for what he's done.}
<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{he is my blood. i serve him with my life.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{by fighting his army?}
<A>__{katsumoto looks at a1gren.}
<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{i do not fight the emperor. i fight those who seek to influence him, those who betray the soul of my country.}
<A>__{he slowl y draws his long samurai sword, and places it next to the flowers on the table in front of him.}
<C>__{ka tsumoto}
<D>__{the emperor gave this blade to my ancestors 400 years ago. it has been used only to defend his sacred honor.}
<A>__{katsumoto hands the sword to algren. algren studies it.}
<C>__{katsmuoto}
<D>__{it takes many years to make a sword. it is a holy act. a samurai's sword is his soul.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{this sword is flawed. what is this uneven line near the edge?}
<A>__{katsumoto smiles at algren's ignorance.}
<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{one man is flexible and compromises too much to avoid conflict. another man is so fierce he wins ever y battle, but so rigid he can never know peace. a man who knows both is the perfect warrior. the lame is true of a blade .. one steel bends, and the other cuts. and where they meet is never perfect hold the blade up. .}
<A>__{algren holds the sword, cutting edge up. katsumoto takes a silk cloth and drops it. it gently billows down and splits evenly on the edge.}
<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{some believe a blade is thirsty until it tastes the blood of its enemy.}
<A>__{algren hands the sword back. suddenly, katsumoto swings the sword, cleanly splitting the table in two. silence.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{the crew at winchester can produce one rifle ever y seven minutes.}
<C>__{ka tsumoto}
<D>__{we gave up firearms two hundred years ago. it takes no courage to kill. a man from half a mile awa y. you must look into the eyes of your enemy to know who you have killed.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{i'm not sure an artillery officer would agree.}
<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{i think all killing's a filthy business.}
<C>__{katsumo}
<D>__{to taking a man's life is nothing. it is his honor you can never take awa y.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{in other words you have no respect for human life.}
<C>__{ka tsumoto}
<P>__{(fierce) .}
<D>__{what do you know of human life? you come here to kill for money where is your family? where is your wife, your sons? what is your legacy?}
<C>__{algren}
<P>__{(undaunted)}
<D>__{and what is yours? to rebel against the future? i fought the south in our civil war. their leaders believed they were fighting for "honor" just as you do. and their people died by the thousands!}
<A>__{katsumoto simply looks at him.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{and my wife is dead.}
<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{mine, too.}
<A>__{they look at each other. some unexpected recognition has taken place.}
<C>__{katsumoto}
