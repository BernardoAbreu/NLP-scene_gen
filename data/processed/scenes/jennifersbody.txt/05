<A>__{devil's kettle is a quiet farming community, surrounded by dense woods and mirrored lakes. it's the kind of town that has one high school, one pizza joint, and one stoplight. on an overgrown rural route we see a rustic sign that reads "welcome to devil's kettle pop. 7,036. come see what's cookin'!"}
