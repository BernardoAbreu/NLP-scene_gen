<L>__{interior o'reily's night}
<A>__{late. the bar is nearly empty. no sign of the knight. brenna looks at her watch, sighs, and drops a bill onto the counter.}
<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{brenna has left the bar and is now walking down a dimly lit street. she hears something and turns. nothing. a breeze rustles the trees above. after only a few more paces she hears something again. brenna abruptly turns. right into the face of the knight. brenna screams. the knight reaches into his leather carrying bag.}
<B>__{a group of noisy teenagers}
<A>__{exit a facing townhouse. the knight removes his hand from the bag as they spill onto the sidewalk laughing and yelling. brenna moves close to the group as they walk to the corner. the knight follows at a measured distance. at the corner the teenagers climb into a pickup and drive off. brenna bolts into the intersection. weaving through screeching brakes, she disappears into a pair of lighted glass doors.}
