<L>__{interior tenement hallway night}
<A>__{tommy clears the stairs, heads for his door. unlocking the second lock, he looks around, alert, like he heard something. then opens the door.}
<L>__{interior tenement tommy's apartment night}
<A>__{alex waits for tommy, crouched by an open window that looks out onto an alley, a four story drop.}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(sees alex, then)}
<D>__{march?!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{sssshhh. she's resting.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{where the fuck did you come from?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator? all possibilities. although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.}
<A>__{tommy starts toward alex, who pulls the knife from the evidence room.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{you lied at my trial.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i don't know you, man.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{capital case nine nine dash c one one five. alex corvis.}
<P>__{(flashes knife)}
<D>__{exhibit a.}
<A>__{wham. alex pins what looks like tommy's arm. it's just his jacket, but it immobilizes tommy.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{hey. i said what i saw. two kids arguing. a guy and a girl.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you said you saw me with this. i never held it until today.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{what's your damage, man? corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.}
<A>__{alex heaves tommy crashing into the window, smashing the glass and cheap aluminum frame. tommy hanging halfway in, halfway out. four floors above the alley. alex rips tommy's shirt where the knife already cut it. jacks the sleeve down. no scar there.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{one chance to tell the truth, tommy. who is the man with the scar? he planted this in my car.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{there's no scar. corvis made it up.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{wrong. answer.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{tommy's wife}
<D>__{tommy!}
<A>__{tommy's wife enters from the bedroom, screaming. heavy eye makeup, looking like she just woke up. os, a toddler cries as she throws herself on alex and they spill back inside.}
<C>__{tommy's wife }
<D>__{let him go! let him go!}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{honey. take the baby. get out of here now!}
<A>__{but she doesn't leave. she pleads in wrenching sobs that seem to affect alex. the crow lands in the window.}
<C>__{tommy's wife}
<D>__{he's all i got. tommy and the baby. don't take him. the baby needs a father.}
<A>__{her mascara runs down her cheeks, a facsimile of alex's mask. they share a long look, connected by pain. the crow cawing a warning, hopping in the window as...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{your baby is crying. go.}
<A>__{tommy nods at his wife, who heads off to the bedroom. the crow gives alex an admonishing caw, then takes flight.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{what did they give you?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{they showed me pictures, what he did to her. evidence. said all i had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(repeats, insistent)}
<D>__{what did they give you?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{a job. construction. twelve an hour.}
<A>__{tommy's wife returns, holding a fifteen month old boy. alex unfolds "the list," passes it to tommy, blank side up.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{write down their names. all of them.}
<A>__{but tommy takes a look at "the list" and flips it over... "the list" tommy points to the police witness list. dutton, erlich, larkin, toomey.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you already got 'em. right here. these cops said the needed an eyewitness, or corvis would walk.}
<A>__{alex drops his head. all clear now. he laughes gently at the sound of sirens approaching, still blocks away.}
