<B>__{med. close}
<A>__{clayton kisses her.}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{i was roundin' up some stock. that's why i didn't come sooner.}
<A>__{marcia hugs him. in the b.g. clay goes over to the fire, kicks the dirt off the embers and piles on wood. the fire flares up.}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{what do you mean running off without a word.}
<B>__{two shot}
<A>__{mary and helen.}
<C>__{marcia's voice}
<D>__{i didn't know who to tell, it all happened so sudden, those people comin' and throwin' us out on the street.}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{don't you think about it, darlin'. don't you think about anythin' but us.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{looks like we lose a good piano player.}
<A>__{camera angle widens as marcia and jim come forward. the fire now burns briskly. clay rejoins the group.}
<C>__{marcia}
<P>__{(happily)}
<D>__{jim came after me, mary.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{i see he did.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{with a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(sharp)}
<D>__{why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in aspen. i told the man in sonora there were four of us. if only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. we've got to stick together. like we've always done.}
<C>__{marcia}
<D>__{i've got a chance to get married.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{that's what i'm gettin' at. it never works. don't forget we were thrown out of aspen.}
<C>__{marcia}
<D>__{jim doesn't care, do you, jim?}
<A>__{mary speaks before jim can answer.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{but jim isn't the only one you're marrying. he has folks and friends. what are they going to say? and how're they going to feel? i tell you, it won't work.}
<A>__{the joy goes out of marcia's expression. she looks up at jim, her eyes begging him to tell her it will work. jim, a naturally shy man, loses his tongue momentarily. clay jumps into the breach.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{of course it'll work. you can get another girl to fill out the act.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(ignoring him)}
<D>__{and look at it this way. how about jim it puts him in a sort of tough spot.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i know what i'm doing. my folks got nothin' to do with it }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you've talked this over with them?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{they know about marcia.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{and they don't like the idea!}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{suppose they don't. this is his problem. he's over twenty one. he wants to marry marcia and marcia wants to marry him so let 'em alone.}
<A>__{mary turns on clay.}
<B>__{two shot}
<A>__{clay and mary. the others in the b.g.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{if you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.}
<A>__{camera angle widens as he turns back to the fire, embarrassed by the spot he's in, and throws wood on it, mary watching him. steve comes over to mary.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(friendly)}
<D>__{i would!}
<A>__{clay swings around and comes back.}

<D>__{go on, there's a good boy.}
<A>__{clay gives steve a gentle push. steve exits.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(bitter)}
<D>__{don't you want him to hear your answer? well, i know what it is. for the other fellow it's all right but not you. all you want is to get rid of one of us.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{wait a minute.}
<A>__{jim, his arm around marcia, moves closer. helen is in the b.g., watching.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no need of you two arguin' about this. we know what we want to do, and nothin' either of you says makes any difference. we want to go home tonight.}
<P>__{(to clay)}
<D>__{will you sell me one of your horses?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i can't do that. i went a long way to get those horses.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{all right, we'll ride double. come on, marcia.}
<A>__{taking her arm he leads her to where the horse stands at the edge of the camp.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{featuring marcia and jim. in the b.g. mary comes after them.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no need to do that, marcia.}
<A>__{jim and marcia turn.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we've got two horses and they're four of us. so half of one of 'em is yours.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{the other half's a wedding present.}
<A>__{marcia comes over to hug mary. as marcia and jim leave, mary moves to clay.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{big hearted fella. can't see young love thwarted especially if it makes one less girl to worry about. that's all you really want, isn't it.}
