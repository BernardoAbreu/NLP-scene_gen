<L>__{interior the grand ticino night}
<A>__{the dinner crowd is in and most of the tables are occupied. the entranceway door opens and rose enters. she's got herself up very nice. the host, jimmy, quickly approaches her. she's very dignified.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{hello, mrs. castorini. who's coming?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{it's just me. i want to eat.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i got a table for you right now.}
<A>__{jimmy leads her to a table for two against the wall.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{this alright?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{he seats her.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{enjoy your meal.}
<A>__{jimmy breezes off. there's another table for two against the wall to rose's front. we see a woman's back from rose's pov, and a pretty head of hair. this woman, whose name is sheila, is having an argument with the man across from her. but the man's face is blocked by sheila's back and head, and the argument is too low to be made out. bobo approaches rose's table.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{good evening mrs. castorini. you eating alone tonight?}
<C>__{rose}

<C>__{bobo}

<A>__{bobo reappears with the martini and serves it.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{you wanna see a menu?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{not yet. i will wave.}
<A>__{bobo is gone. rose is mildly intrigued with the argument at the next table now. she tries to see past sheila, to see the man, but she can't without making too big a move. the argument goes on.}
<C>__{sheila's voice}
<D>__{i really do hate it though, when you take that tone with me. like you're above it all and isn't it amusing.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{but it is, isn't it?}
<C>__{sheila's voice}
<D>__{not to me! this is my life, no matter how damned comical it may seem to you. i don't need some man standing above the struggle while i roll around in the mud!}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{i think you like the mud and i don't. that's fair, isn't it? if i don't care to...}
<A>__{sheila stands up abruptly and flings a glass of water in the man's face. she pulls her coat off the back of her chair and stalks off. this whole operation took about two seconds. when she stalks off, the face of the man becomes visible to rose for the first time. it's perry, the professor in his}
