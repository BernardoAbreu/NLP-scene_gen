<L>__{interior coffin moments later}
<A>__{the zippo lights. paul holds it in his hand, using it to illuminate the inside of the coffin. he attempts to push it into its now customary resting place, but the sand has loosened, making it difficult for the zippo to stay in place. it almost falls to the floor. looking around, paul sees there is a crack between two planks, located on the opposite wall of the coffin. he wedges the lit zippo into the crack. with his hands now free, paul haphazardly positions himself so that his back is facing the top of the coffin. his every move is arduous; the claustrophobic nature of the coffin bearing down on him. paul positions his bent knees underneath his chest, with his shins and feet pressed against the bottom of the coffin. using the strength of his legs, he attempts to lift the top off the coffin with his back. trickles of sand fall in from the side of the coffin, sprinkling against the wooden base. he fails, only to immediately try again. and again. and again. exhaustion sets in. staring ahead, the phone sits in front of him. he notices that the battery life bars are still at one solid and one blinking. he grabs the cell phone, staring at it, trying to think of someone else to call. the battery life is limited. every call has to count. he tries to remember some phone numbers, but has trouble recalling the information.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{come on, what's her number?}
<A>__{he cannot remember the number he's thinking of. he notices that the flame of the zippo flickers, indicating its use of his much needed oxygen. paul closes the lid, extinguishing the flame. a second later, we see him, lit by the cell phone display screen. he dials the international code for the united states, followed by 411 information. a male 411 operator answers.}
<C>__{male 411 operator}
<D>__{what city and listing, please?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hastings, michigan. i'm looking for donna mitchell.}
<C>__{male 411 operator}
<D>__{i have two donna mitchells, sir. one on federal road and one on ardmore avenue.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{ardmore avenue...i think. yeah. shit, i don't know. just give me that one.}
<C>__{male 411 operator}
<D>__{ardmore avenue?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes, ardmore avenue.}
<C>__{male 411 operator}
<D>__{please hold for your number.}
<A>__{paul is switched to an automated message.}
<C>__{automated message}
<D>__{the number you requested, 269 948 1998 can automatically be dialed for a charge of twenty five cents by pressing the number one.}
<A>__{paul writes donna's number and name on the top of the coffin and then presses the number one. he is connected. her phone rings and rings. paul's frustration is evident.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{come on! where the hell is everyone?}
<A>__{the phone rings some more. paul checks the battery life still at one and a half bars. donna eventually answers.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{hearing her voice, paul hurriedly places the phone to his ear.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{donna, it's paul.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{hey, how's it going?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{where's linda? she's not answering her phone. i need to talk to her, i've been taken hostage by...}
<A>__{donna interrupts. we realize, as does paul, that her voice was actually coming from her answering machine.}
<C>__{donna}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{fooled you. i'm not really home. but if you leave a message, i will get back to you as soon as i get in. bye bye.}
<A>__{his hand falls to his forehead, defeated.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{donna, i need to talk to linda. it's an absolute emergency. have her call me. use star sixty nine and find out the number i'm calling from and have her call me...}
<A>__{donna picks up the phone.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{paul?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{donna.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i need to talk to linda. where is she?}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{i don't know. i haven't talked to her all day. call her cell phone.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{are you near a computer or something?}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{uh...yeah. why?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{turn it on.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{it is on.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{look up the number for the state department for me.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{i was just heading out to the supermarket. i really don't have time }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{donna, please, please, please just get me the number.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{is everything alright?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no! everything is not alright! so, please, just look up the number.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{don't fucking yell at me, paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm not yelling!}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{yes you are. just like you did last year at the cookout. i'm not going to tolerate }
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{just get me the fucking number!! get me the number, get me the number!!}
<A>__{donna hangs up on him. realizing this, paul bangs his fists and claws at the top of the coffin, bloodying some of his fingers and knuckles in the process. he violently tosses and turns and screams at the top of his lungs, like an animal trapped in a cage. tears spray from his eyes as spit shakes free from his mouth by the force of his shudder. he eventually calms quite a bit. sniffing away tears and taking notice of the damage he's done to his hands, paul slows his breathing as best he can. he lies there, motionless. the silence is almost comforting. paul closes his eyes, regretfully accepting what appears will be his inescapable fate. after a beat, he calls donna back. knowing it is paul calling, she answers right away, attitude at the ready.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{it takes every ounce of paul's being to keep himself from going off the deep end. he takes a beat to compose himself and then finally offers a very delicate and deliberate response.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{donna, i'm very sorry i yelled. but, i'm only going to ask you once more to get me this number. if you don't get me this number, i'm going to die.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't have time to explain. please...the number.}
<C>__{donna}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hold on.}
<A>__{we hear donna put down the phone. in the b.g., we hear the sound of keys being pressed on a computer keyboard. after a beat, she picks the phone back up.}
<C>__{donna }
<D>__{okay...state department. it's 202 134 4750.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{202 134 4750?}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{paul writes the number on the top of the coffin, beneath the man others. he writes the initials "s.d." next to it.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{what the hell's going }
<A>__{paul hangs up on donna mid sentence. he dials the number the state department right away. a state department rep answers after a few rings.}
<C>__{state department rep}
<D>__{united states department of state.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm an american citizen, working in iraq. i've been taken hostage. i need to speak to someone right away.}
<C>__{state department rep}
<D>__{where are you calling from, sir?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{from iraq. i'm a truck driver for crt crestin, roland and thomas. we were attacked and now i'm being held for ransom.}
<C>__{state department rep}
<D>__{are the kidnappers with you?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no. i'm buried somewhere.}
<C>__{state department rep}
<D>__{you're buried?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah, in a coffin, a wooden box. it's an old coffin, i think.}
<C>__{state department rep}
<D>__{did you try contacting the military out there?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't have the number.}
<C>__{state department rep}
<D>__{what number?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i was given a number to call, a safety number. but the people took it.}
<C>__{state department rep}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{state department rep}
<P>__{(disconcerted)}
<D>__{i don't know...hold on. let me connect you...hold on.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no. wait...}
<A>__{paul is placed on hold. as he waits, his eyes wander around the coffin. he looks at the numbers he has written. after a moment, rebecca browning, a state department official, picks up the phone.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{rebecca browning.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{yes, hello. i was just informed of your situation.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah, my situation. i'm running out of time and you people keep putting me on hold. what the hell is wrong with you?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{don't be sorry. just help me.}
<C>__{rebecca}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{wait, wait, wait...how did you know my name?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i never gave you my name. i don't think i gave it to the other guy, either.}
<A>__{rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{what the hell is going on right now?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{we received a call from a representative at crt. you left him a message?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah...?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{he contacted us right away.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, since you know what the hell is going on, what have you done to get me out of here?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{there's little we can do from washington.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so, that's it? i'm just supposed to rot in here because there's little you can do?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{then what?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i need to know where you were when your convoy was ambushed.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{in the diyala provence. in baqubah.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{okay. and has contact been made with the kidnappers?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes. the guy told me that he wants five million dollars by nine o'clock tonight.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{or else...?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{or else he'll bring me to sea world. what do you think, lady?}
<A>__{even faced with paul's sarcasm, rebecca remains stolid. professional.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{we'll do everything we can.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so you'll pay them?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no. that we can't do.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{wait...what?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{it's the policy of the united states government to not negotiate with terrorists.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{to hell with that! it's easy for you to worry about policy, you're sitting in an air conditioned office somewhere, probably finishing up your sandwich from lunch. you're not the one stuck in a coffin, buried in the god damn desert!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i understand your frustration }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{frustration? lady, i'm going to fucking die in here. understand that!}
<A>__{rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone. paul wonders if she is still there. the idea of being alone again scares him terribly.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{worried, paul lights the zippo. the reflection of the flame dances on his frightened eyes.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i'm here.}
<A>__{momentary relief. after a beat:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, then say something. tell me how you're going to get me out of here.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{what's the number on the phone you're calling from?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't know. did it come up on your end?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{no. it's listed as unavailable. do this take down this number.}
<A>__{paul takes out his pen.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{410 195 5453.}
<A>__{paul writes the number onto the top of the coffin.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{dan brenner. he's the commander of the hostage working group over in iraq.}
<A>__{paul writes "d. brenner" next to dan's phone number.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hostage working group?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{we formed it in 2004 to deal with situations such as yours.}
<A>__{paul shakes his head in disgust.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{situations. i love how you keep calling it that.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{did you write down the number?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{good. hold on, i will connect you with him now. he should be expecting you.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what about the news? i'm going to call them.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{no. do not, i repeat, do not contact the news.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{it will only complicate things further and threaten your chances of rescue.}
<A>__{paul doesn't buy it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's bullshit. you're just covering your ass.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{no, i'm covering yours. everyone who needs to know about this does.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you don't go looking for something if you don't know it's missing.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{that's why you need to contact dan brenner right away.}
<A>__{paul still contemplates contacting the news, but soon acquiesces to rebecca's pleas for him not to.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i'm transferring you now.}
<A>__{rebecca's gone. paul waits. several beeps sound as he's being transferred. paul hears a faint sound coming from behind him, outside the coffin. while the beeps continue to sound, he lights the zippo, circumspectly looking behind him. he doesn't see anything. with the zippo still lit, paul takes a deep, centering breath, followed by another. a few more long beeps pass before a ring is heard. after two rings, dan brenner answers.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{brenner.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{dan brenner?}
<A>__{dan is quick to figure out who it is that must be calling him.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{is this paul conroy?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{yes, yes it's me. it's paul.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{paul, i was informed of what's going on. i want you to know that we're already working on trying to get you out of there.}
<A>__{paul is relieved. his first glint of hope has appeared. tears of joy instantly escape his eyes.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh, thank you, god.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i was told that we have until 9pm. is that right?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's what he said.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{alright. that doesn't give us a whole lot of time. and just so i have this right, the kidnappers buried you in the ground?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah, in an old, wooden coffin.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{okay. my guess is that since you're able to get a cell signal, you're no more than a few feet underground.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{what about battery life? how much does the phone have left?}
<A>__{paul looks at the display to find out.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{less than half.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{okay. you have to conserve that battery. our best bet of finding you is by tracking your cell signal. is the ringer set on a sound or vibrate?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{vibrate.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{press and hold down the asterisk key to change it to a ring tone. it will use less power.}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{what about my zippo?}
<C>__{dan}
<A>__{you have a lighter?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{yeah.}
<C>__{dan}
<A>__{use it to look around for markings, a logo whatever you can find.}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{won't it use up oxygen?}
<C>__{dan}
<A>__{not much. don't worry about that now. try to find }
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{it's really dark in here without it.}
<C>__{dan}
<A>__{i understand, paul. try to find anything in there that might indicate where that coffin was made.}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{you guys have to hurry.}
<C>__{dan}
<A>__{we're working as fast as we can, paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{do you know if there were any other survivors?}
<C>__{dan}
<A>__{from your convoy?}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{yeah.}
<C>__{dan}
<A>__{that's still unclear at this pointerior}
<C>__{paul}
<A>__{i just wanted to do right by my family. that's all.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{i didn't know it was going to be like this over here.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i don't think any of us did.}
<A>__{while on the phone with brenner, paul gets another call coming in. he checks the display and reads the number. matching it against a number he wrote on the top of the coffin, he sees that is jabir calling.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's him. he's calling.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{the kidnapper?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah. what do i do?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{you know his number?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{give it to me.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what about the call?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{give me the number first.}
<A>__{the phone has rung several times. paul fears that jabir may hang up.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{he's going to hang up.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{take the call.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{take the call. now.}
<A>__{paul complies with dan's demand and switches to the other line.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{two hour, six minute.}
<A>__{paul looks at his watch. indeed, he has but two hours and six minutes until the time reaches 9pm.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you have to give me more time.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{you talk to embassy? they give money?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes. no. i talked to...someone. government. they said that they won't pay the money.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{no pay?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no. they said that they don't negotiate with terrorists.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{terrorists? i am terrorist?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes. you are terrorist, you son of a bitch.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{you are terrified, so i am terrorist?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what did i ever do to you?}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{ever do?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah. i'm here because it's a job, to make money. that's it.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{i have job until you come. now, my family have nothing.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's not my fault!}
<A>__{jabir retorts with a spirited conviction similar to paul's.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{nine, one, one was not my fault, but still you are here! saddam was not my fault, but still you are here!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i told you, i'm only here to work. to help rebuild.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{rebuild what you destroyed.}
<A>__{paul cannot handle his stress any longer. he begins to crumble under the pressure.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{stop! just please, stop! i'm just a guy. i'm just a truck driver. okay? i'm nobody that makes decisions about anything. i just want to go home.}
<A>__{silence from the other end of the phone for an extended period of time.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{you make video, ransom video.}
<A>__{this surprisingly comes as good news to paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes. please. get me out of here and i will make the video.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{no. you make video now.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what...? how?}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{you use video on phone.}
<A>__{paul's hopes are dashed. his sanguine head falls back onto the coffin floor.}
<C>__{jabir }
<D>__{near foot. you read note near foot in box.}
<A>__{paul shines the flame of his zippo lighter toward his feet. he doesn't see anything.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{where? i don't see }
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{near foot. read note inside box.}
<A>__{paul repositions his legs as best he can. he can vaguely see the corner of a small metal box, partially sticking out of a broken plank on the bottom of the coffin.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the video...if i make it, will you let me go?}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{only if we get money.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{nobody's going to pay five million dollars for me.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{we take less. one million money.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{if they pay it, will you let me go?}
<C>__{jabir}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{one million money.}
<A>__{jabir hangs up, ending the call. paul sits motionless for a moment, soaking in all that jabir has just told him. he again looks down toward his feet. he can see the protruding corner of the metal box, but it's positioned in such a way that it will clearly not be easy for him to reach it. paul then tries to clasp the box with his feet, but after several unsuccessful attempts, he realizes that a new strategy is necessary. he makes efforts to reposition himself in the coffin, so that his head and feet will ultimately switch places. he struggles, inch by troubled inch, to make this maneuver. sweat pours down the side of his face. the extremely tight quarters of the coffin make the repositioning nearly impossible. after expending a great deal of energy doing so, paul eventually completes the turn of his body. he examines the small, rusted metal box. on it is a cartoon picture of a small arab boy and girl playing with a red rubber ball. skeptical at first, paul carefully examines the box and shakes it gently. items are heard rummaging inside. he carefully opens it. a fluorescent green light shines from inside. paul looks inside and finds a lit, green glow stick, fluorescing brightly and now illuminating much of the coffin. he closes the lid of the zippo. removes the stick. looking into the small box again, he finds several other items: a small, disused flashlight; a second, unlit glow stick; a jackknife; and lastly, a folded piece of paper. he slowly unfolds the piece of paper. we see that his ransom message is written in an unintelligible mix of english and arabic. paul shakes his head and lets out a sigh of disgust. he crumbles up the paper into a ball and listlessly drops it to his side. he covers his face with his hands, his labored breaths echoing in his palms. under the low light of the green glow stick, paul picks up the phone and dials his home. per usual, he gets the answering machine. his son, shane, is heard on outgoing message.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{thanks for calling the conroy's. we're not home right now. please leave a message at the beep. thanks.}
<A>__{paul's eyes well up with tears. he smiles at the sound of his son's voice. the beep is heard. paul hangs up without leaving a message. he looks at the time. it's 7:02pm. battery life is holding steady at one and a half bars. he remembers something.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{paul presses and holds down the shortcut button on the phone that changes the ringer from vibrate to an audible tone. the glow stick begins to slowly fade. paul dials dan brenner. after a few rings, dan answers.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{paul?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{here's his number...}
<A>__{paul presses the green key, bringing up the last numbers dialed and received.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{hold on. alright, go ahead.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's 07902 24 921.}
<A>__{dan says something to someone who is in the room with him, and then returns his attention to paul.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{this is huge. unless they're using a cloned line, we should be able to find where this is coming from in minutes.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what about me? can you track my cell signal?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we're having a lot of trouble with yours. seems to be an eds line, probably through one of the egyptian carriers.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{that...it's not going to be easy.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{he wants me to make a ransom video.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{no. hold off for as long as you can.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{if it's going to get me out of here, i'm making it.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{the last thing we want is for this to end up all over al jazeera.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we?}
<A>__{paul becomes angry, again sensing that more emphasis is being placed on containing the situation than rescuing him.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{this can't turn into an international incident.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's all you people care about! but what about me? don't you care about me?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we do. that's why we're }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no you don't! you people don't care about any of us. i've had eight friends killed out here, six of them today. we don't have any guns, any armor. nothing.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{you're not soldiers.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{tell that to the people who put me in this box! tell that to the people who shot my friends!}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we're doing the best we can.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, you're not. all you people understand are your secret plans and your back room politics.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{if i were some diplomat or something, maybe even a hostage working group leader or whatever your fancy title is, i'd be out of here by now. wouldn't i? but i'm not, so i'm just supposed to keep my mouth shut and die.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i need you to stay focused, paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{dan's heard enough.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{paul, listen to me: finding you is our primary concern. bottom line. and we're searching just as hard as we would be for a four star general, so don't literally waste your breath suggesting otherwise.}
<A>__{paul does not respond at first. dan's retort clearly has an effect on him.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{who are they? the people who put me here?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{they're just that people. no different from you and me.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm no terrorist.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{neither are they.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{if you were homeless, starving...actually, i take that back. if your family was homeless and starving, what would you do for them?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i wouldn't kill someone.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{how can you be sure?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(getting frustrated)}
<D>__{what difference does it make?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{they're criminals, desperate ones at that. they don't care about anything other than getting the money.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so pay them, then.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{trust me, if it was an option, i would do that in a heartbeat.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{how many others have there been?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{since i got here? hundreds. journalists, contractors, soldiers...hundreds have been taken. it's one of the only functioning businesses out here.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{how many have you rescued?}
<A>__{dan is reluctant to answer the question.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{not many.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{tell me their names.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{any of them. make me know they really do matter to you.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{mark white.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{who was mark white?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{a kid from new hampshire. twenty six years old. med student. came over here to help out local doctors.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what happened to him?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{insurgents grabbed him.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{about three weeks ago.}
<A>__{paul writes "mark white" on the top of the coffin, below the list of phone numbers. he circles the name.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you remember his name.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i remember all their names.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(afraid to ask)}
<D>__{did he...? is he...?}
<A>__{the glow stick begins to fade.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{yeah. yeah, paul, he's alive.}
<A>__{hearing this affords paul some semblance of relief. paul shakes the glow stick, returning it to its full strength.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{home. probably happy to be back at school.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i want to get out of here.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we found him; we'll find you, too.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we already have a solid lead on the number you gave us.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{a unit's on it's way over there now.}
<A>__{this news calms paul's nerves.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's...that's good.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what should i do in the meantime?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i know it's hard, but try to relax. the more worked up you are, the more air you're going to use.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i can't help it. i'm always anxious. i take pills for it.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{do you have them with you?}
<A>__{paul checks his pants pockets. he removes a small, orange pill bottle.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{take them. you need to preserve your oxygen level any way you can.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{is your zippo still lit.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{not now.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i feel nauseous.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{you have to calm down.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm trying.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{and you need to save that battery. we're expecting some intel in about ten minutes. call me back then.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{just hang in there, paul.}
<A>__{the glow stick begins to slowly fade. paul shakes it, causing it to brighten only momentarily before dimming again.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah. i'm trying.}
<A>__{dan ends the call. paul lets out a deep breath, finding it difficult to lay claim to its replacement. he looks at his watch. it's now 7:18pm. the ticking sound of the second hand turning is inordinately loud, due to the extreme silence of the coffin. just then, the cell phone rings. checking the number on the display, paul sees that it is jabir. paul answers.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{did you make video?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{jabir yells something in arabic to the other iraqi men we hear in the background. collectively, they do not sound pleased. slightly panicked, in fact, though it is difficult to tell for sure.}
<C>__{jabir}
<P>__{(to paul)}
<D>__{you make video!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{let me out and i will make it.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{no! you make video now. in box.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i can't. i can't read the paper.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{make video now!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i can't. i don't know what you want me to say. i can't read the paper.}
<A>__{jabir is heard speaking with the men we hear arguing in the background. although they speak in arabic, it is clear from their tone that they are becoming worried and increasingly hostile. jabir returns his attention back to paul.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{you make video now.}
<A>__{jabir ends the call. paul closes the phone to help conserve battery life. he then reopens the phone and scrolls through the menu options. everything is written in arabic. he eventually comes across an icon with a movie camera the video function. he turns it on. looks at himself though the viewfinder. after a beat, he closes the phone, clearly frustrated and growing more panicked. his breaths grow heavy and rapid, utilizing a great deal of oxygen.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm never getting out of here.}
<A>__{paul begins to freak out, restlessly squirming inside the coffin and pressing against the sides and top. the glow stick fades out almost completely, offering very little light. paul shakes it, but with no change to its brightness. moments later, it dies. paul tries the flashlight. click click. click click. nothing. he bangs it a few times with his hand. the white light turns on, but quickly turns back off. he twists the top, which causes the flashlight to switch bulbs. a red beam emits momentarily. paul twists the top again and gives the flashlight a few good whacks. it turns on. white light shines dimly on his face. he takes a breath. in efforts to calm himself, he once again removes the orange pill bottle from his pocket. he pours two into his hand. he then removes his small, metal alcohol flask from his back pocket and takes a large swig, swallowing the two pills in the process. still, paul's heavy, labored breathing continues. he drops four additional pills into his and swallows them with yet another generous pull from the flask. he sits and waits. nothing is happening, except that his extremely limited time keeps passing. after a moment, paul picks up the cell phone. he holds it in front of him, hesitant to make a call. after some consideration, he dials. after a few rings, a nursing home nurse answers.}
<C>__{nursing home nurse}
<D>__{mountain view nursing home.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i was hoping i could speak with maryanne conroy, please.}
<C>__{nursing home nurse}
<D>__{um...okay. ah...let me bring the cordless phone to her room. hold on a moment, please.}
<A>__{we hear the nurse walk down the tiled corridor floor. she soon reaches paul's mother's room.}
<C>__{nursing home nurse }
<D>__{misses conroy, you have a telephone call, dear. here, you can use this phone.}
<A>__{paul's mother, maryanne, answers. her voice is pleasant but confused. it's clear that she suffers from advanced stages of alzheimer's disease.}
<C>__{maryanne}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{mom...it's paul.}
<C>__{maryanne}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's paul, mom. your son.}
<C>__{maryanne}
<D>__{my son?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's okay, mom. how are you?}
<C>__{maryanne}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's good.}
<C>__{maryanne}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's your son, mom. it's paulie.}
<C>__{maryanne}
<D>__{paulie?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah. remember? we lived over on colfax street, in the duplex. remember?}
<C>__{maryanne}
<P>__{(remembering slightly)}
<D>__{paulie?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's right, mom.}
<C>__{maryanne}
<D>__{is this paulie?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it is, mom. it's paulie. how's everything at the home?}
<C>__{maryanne}
<D>__{very nice. your father and i have been playing gin rummy every night.}
<A>__{it's almost too much for paul to take. he cries silent tears over a heartbroken smile.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah...i don't think pop's there with you, mom.}
<C>__{maryanne}
<D>__{how are you doing, sweetie?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{not very good. this...uh, this may be the last time i talk to you.}
<C>__{maryanne}
<D>__{that's nice, honey.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{did you get the flowers i sent a few months ago?}
<C>__{maryanne}
<D>__{flowers?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah, i sent...never mind. listen, i...i'm going to go now. i just wanted to talk to you, you know, just to say bye. i love you, mom.}
<A>__{maryanne doesn't respond.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{did you hear me? mom? i told you...do you want to tell me you love }
<C>__{maryanne}
<D>__{yes, dear. your father and i have been playing gin rummy every night.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{okay, mom. tell pop i said hi.}
<A>__{paul ends the call and instantly begins crying his heart out. he lays there, sobbing relentlessly. after a long beat, the cell phone rings. decidedly different than his past reactions to an incoming call, paul seems hopelessly disinterested. the ring is maddening. he mindlessly presses the shortcut button, resetting the ring to vibrate mode. he eventually picks up the phone, but there is not anyone on the other end. it's then that he sees that it was not a call that came in, but instead was a picture message. pressing what appears to be the accept button, the incoming picture begins to download. several seconds later, the picture downloads and an image appears on the display of paul's cell phone. it's of a woman bound and gagged, a gun pressed against the side of her head.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh no. no, no, no!}
<A>__{paul frantically dials the number to reach jabir. as soon as the phone connects, paul begins his desperate plea.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{video make?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{let her go. please. please don't hurt her.}
<A>__{the woman is heard in the background of jabir's phone, crying muffled words through her muzzled mouth.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{we shoot her if you no make video.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no! no, please no shoot. no shoot her.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{you get money. american million.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i will, i promise. just don't shoot her. she's a mother, she's got two kids.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{two kids?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes. she has two kids.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{i have five. now only one. you make video. now!!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{wait...}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{no wait!! i give three seconds.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i can't read the paper.}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{three...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no. wait!}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{two...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't know what you want me to say!}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{one.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{okay! okay, i will make the video. just, please, don't shoot.}
<A>__{jabir does not fire his gun. paul attempts to catch his breath.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{i need to hang up to make the video. okay? is that okay?}
<C>__{jabir}
<D>__{you have three minute to send video.}
<A>__{jabir hangs up, ending the call. paul reaches for the balled up piece of paper that has the ransom script written on it. it takes some trouble for him to grab it, but he is soon able to. placing the flashlight next to the paper, paul is again reminded of the incoherent nature of the script.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(re: the script)}
<D>__{fuck...}
<A>__{he drops the paper to his side and opens the phone, setting it to the video record function. he places the flashlight close to his face so as to make his image more visible on the small, phone display screen. he presses the record button.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(speaking at the phone)}
<D>__{my name is paul conroy. i'm an american citizen from hastings, michigan. i'm a civilian truck driver for crestin, roland and thomas. i've been taken hostage somewhere in iraq...and i need one million dollars by nine o'clock tonight, baghdad time, or else i will be left to die in this coffin i'm buried in. i've been told that if...}
<A>__{the flashlight goes out. paul continues speaking in the darkness. after a few quick smacks, the flashlight turns back on.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{...the money is paid, i will be let go. if it's not, i will die in here. these threats are real and will be followed through on.}
<A>__{trying to think of more to say, paul soon opts for not saying anything further. he saves the message and then sends it to jabir. we see that the screen displays an icon confirming the video has been sent. paul places the phone on his chest. still rubbing his temples, his eyes begin to flutter a bit. he tries to control his breathing and remain calm. he opens the phone and displays the photo of the woman. he stares admiringly at her, hoping dearly that she will not be harmed. the effects of the anxiety pills finally taking effect, his eyes soon close and he drifts off to sleep.}
