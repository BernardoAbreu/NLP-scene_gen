<L>__{interior arab bar night}
<A>__{a dark, smoke filled den on iniquity. the patrons, almost all fearsome arabs, sit in small shadowy groups around the room. indy stands at the bar finishing off a fifth of bourbon. he is drunk. the arab bartender places a new bottle of expensive bourbon in front of him. indy eyes is queerly.}
<C>__{arab bartender}
<D>__{the gentleman in the corner sent it. he would like you to join him.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(doesn't even look)}
<D>__{too bad. i'm drinking alone.}
<A>__{the arab bartender does a take, looking at the three, tough german henchmen who have surrounded indy from out of the smoke, their hands stuffed in bulging trenchcoat pockets. indy notices them now with a bleary glance. he decides he's in no shape to kill or be killed and moves with them across the room, taking his bottle with him. the arab patrons take this in and mind their own business. the occupant of the smoke shrouded corner table becomes visible only as indy reaches there: it is emile belloq. he is drinking wine.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{belloq.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{good evening, dr. jones.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i ought to kill you right now.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{it was not i who brought the girl into this dirty business.}
<A>__{indy knows its true; that's what's tearing him up.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{sit down, please, before you fall down. we can behave as civilized people. i'm afraid it will be your last opportunity.}
<A>__{indy sits, glancing at the german henchmen, who settle nearby, just out of earshot.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{not a very private place for a murder.}
<C>__{belloq}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{these arabs will not interfere in the white man's business. they do not care if we kill each other off.}
<P>__{(takes a sip of wine, refers to it)}
<D>__{terribly difficult finding a decent vintage here. you were quite vigorous in shanghai. unfortunately, our friend the wild boar had taken the precaution of making several copies of the piece.}
<A>__{indy registers this as he takes a drink. belloq watches him with disdainful amusement.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{how odd that is should end this way for us, after so many... stimulating encounters. i almost regret it. where shall i find a new adversary so close to my own level?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{try the local sewer.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{i know you despise me. we always hate in others that which we most fear in ourselves. and you and i are very much alike.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{now you're getting nasty.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{we have always done the same kind of work. our methods have not differed as much as you pretend. i am a shadowy reflection of you. but it would have taken only a nudge to make you the same as me, to push you out of the light.}
<A>__{there's a certain amount of truth to this; the recognition of it flickers across indy's bleary eyes. belloq sees it there.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{you know it to be true! how nice. and how ironic the timing.}
<A>__{belloq leans forward, eyes shining, voice suddenly different.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{do you realize what the ark is?}
<P>__{(very intense)}
<D>__{it's a transmitter. a radio for talking to god! and now it is within my grasp.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{what about your boss, der fuhrer? i thought he was waiting to take possession.}
<A>__{belloq glances into the gloom at the german henchmen.}
<C>__{belloq}
<P>__{(quieter)}
<D>__{when the time is right. when i am finished with it.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i hope your friends are patient. dangerous work, belloq.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{yes. very. you may consider yourself fortunate that your involvement concludes here.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{tell me, did you get away with the idol?}
<C>__{belloq}
<P>__{(negative)}
<D>__{i was lucky to get away with my life. the hovitos proved quite narrow minded about the whole matter.}
<A>__{indy takes a drink.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{you know, if it's god you want to talk to, maybe i can arrange it.}
<C>__{belloq}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you have not changed. but, please, do not reach for your weapon until you are ready to die.}
<A>__{the front door of the bar slams open and all nine of sallah's children scamper in and over to a surprised indy. two of the smallest hop into his lap.}
<C>__{little son}
<D>__{uncle indy, we have been looking for you.}
<C>__{little daughter}
<D>__{come home now, uncle. hurry!}
<A>__{suddenly the arab patrons of the bar take an intense interest in the situation, shifting their weapons.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{yes. yes, i will come now.}
<A>__{indy stands up. the german henchmen and poised. belloq eyes the arab patrons and signals for the henchmen to relax.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{next time, indiana jones, it will take more than children to save you.}
<A>__{the children usher indy out.}
