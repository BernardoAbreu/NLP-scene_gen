<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{just some guy. does it even matter who? i stopped asking myself why a long time ago. no reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. a couple of junkies, too strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. when you killed him, i've never seen you so happy i was convinced you'd remember. but it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. like this won't stick.}
