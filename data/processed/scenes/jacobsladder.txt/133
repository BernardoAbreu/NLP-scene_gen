<T>__{cut to jacob :}
<A>__{pressed up against the wall, defying gravity and logic, as though about to merge with the solid surface. his body holds there for a moment and then collapses to the floor. jezzie goes to him.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{jake? jake?}
<A>__{he doesn't answer. he looks at jezzie with a blank stare. his body begins shaking.}
<L>__{interior jacob's bedroom night}
<A>__{jacob is lying on the bed, curled up in a fetal pose. jezzie is stroking his hair and trying to calm him.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{it's going to be all right, jake. it's going to be all right. don't be afraid. i've got you now.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hold me, jezzie. hold me.}
<A>__{jezzie wraps herself around his shivering body and warms him with her own. the image seems tender and comforting until we notice jezzie's tongue darting nervously in and out. it looks strangely like a snake's. addendum 6: the hospital the resident injects the serum into jacob's veins while two orderlies hold him still. jacob barely struggles. his eyes fixate on the emergency room wall. it is white and sterile. within moments it begins to emit a reddish glow. jacob watches with astonishment as the wall's two dimensional surface separates into three dimensional planes. the solid surface gives way to a dark chamber that was not there before. out of the transmuted space creatures begin to form. bosch like demons with horns and tails, undeniably of another world. slowly several of them emerge from the wall and approach jacob. they look like parodies of doctors and nurses, wearing traditional hospital gowns. without a word they wheel him through the space where the wall had been. jacob tries to scream but no sound comes out.}
