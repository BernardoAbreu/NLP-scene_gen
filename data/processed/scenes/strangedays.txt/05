<A>__{lit by miles of fluorescent. empty and echoing. close on lenny. he has something on his head. something that looks like a mutated set of walkman headphones, except they have little gecko fingers that fit along the temples and over the forehead. playback "trodes". lenny whips off the trodes, gasping as if he got gutpunched.}

<D>__{goddamnit! you know i don't deal in snuff. how many times i hafta tell you?!}
<A>__{lenny is with a guy everybody knows as "tick", a pale skinned creature of the night in t shirt and leather jacket. tick is a bottomfeeder in the techno underground of the near future.}

<D>__{don't have a fucking coronary, lenny.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{well you could've at least warned me. you know i hate the zap... when they die. it just brings down your whole day. jeez, tick.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{lenny nero is low thirties. handsome. charming. and you better check to see if you still have your ring after you shake with him. he is wearing an expensive italian jacket, and what he thinks of as a "power tie." his rolex isn't real. his greasy hair is too long and curls around his collar. he needs to shave. a little sleazy. but he has energy, and heavy street smarts. lenny is sitting on the hood of his '97 bmw 1035i. tick is facing him, sitting in the back of his beat to shit}
