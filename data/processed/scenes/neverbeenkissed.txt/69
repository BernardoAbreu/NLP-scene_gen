<L>__{interior den continuous}
<A>__{josie storms into the den, and plants herself on the sofa. she sees that rob has been watching baseball on t.v., and she turns it off.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{i can't do it. i thought i could. i can't. i give up i'm never going to be a reporter.}

<D>__{why is that impossible?}
<A>__{josie's eyes get teary.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. no one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. you never dreamed about being popular you already were. all i wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. i can't do all that again. i can't go back to southglen south.}

<D>__{don't you realize how much i wanted to be you in high school? just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{come on! it's not that hard. all you need is one person. once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. everyone else will be too scared to question it.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{is that true?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{little known fact.}
<A>__{josie takes this in.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{look, don't you wanna show them gus, billy prince, yourself that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? that you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{yes, desperately.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{plus, if you quit you're no better than me.}
<C>__{josie}
