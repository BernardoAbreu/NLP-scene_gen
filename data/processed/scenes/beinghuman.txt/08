<L>__{exterior valley another angle day}
<A>__{hector and the children have reached the safety of a small valley higher up in the hills. the raiders have been slowed down by their capture of deirdre. hector is hoisting his two children into the lower branches of a solitary tree on the hillside. he coaxes them up into the higher branches.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{i'm hungry.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{don't move from here. i will come for you in the morning. there's no food. try and sleep in the branches. don't cry. don't make a noise.}
<A>__{hector moves off, looking back to his children in the tree. they too gaze anxiously at him. they don't wave. maybe waving hasn't been invented yet. hector heads off alone, higher into the hills.}
