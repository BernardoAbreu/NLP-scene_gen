<L>__{interior mib building hallway day}
<A>__{as kay leads edwards down an impossibly long corridor, he hands him a file folder stuffed thick with eight by ten photographs. he hands jay the first picture, a shot of eight or nine men in plain black suits standing around a fifties style office with metal desks and fluorescent lights. dee and zed are there, much younger.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{everybody thought the agency was a joke. except the aliens. they made contact on march 2nd, 1961, outside new york city.}
<A>__{another photograph, a grainy black and white image of two ships hovering in the night sky classic flying saucer shapes.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{there were nine of us that night. seven agents. an amateur astronomer. and one poor kid who got lost on the wrong back road.}
<A>__{yet another photograph, this one showing a young kay, in a shirt and tie, holding a bouquet of flowers, staring at the open door of the landed flying saucer. alien shapes are visible within.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{you brought the aliens flowers?}
<A>__{kay steers edwards to the right, down another corridor, just as long as the first.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{they were intergalactic refugees with a simple request. let us use the earth as an apolitical zone for people without a planet. ever see "casablanca?" same thing, no nazis. we agreed. so we masked all evidence of their landing.}
<A>__{another picture, this one of the 1964 world's fair grounds, still under construction. giant models of rockets mark the fair's theme of space travel; most prominent in the construction are two tall towers, with the flying saucers now mounted at the top of each.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{the 1964 world's fair was a coverup?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{why else would we hold it in queens?}
<P>__{(another hallway)}
<D>__{now left. more nonhumans arrive every year. they live among us, in secret.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{i see. not to change the subject, but when was your last cat scan?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{every six months; it's company policy.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{well, thanks for the very amusing morning, but i'm hopin' you'll show me where i came in? 'cause this is where i go out.}
<A>__{they have stopped next to an unmarked door. kay throws it open and steps inside.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{yeah, sure, hang on, i wanna grab a coffee while we're right here.}
<A>__{as kay walks into the kitchenette, edwards' jaw drops, his eyes widen, and he stares in wonderment at three worm like aliens standing around a water cooler. tall, impossibly thin, most certainly not from new york, the aliens hold an animated conversation in a language that seems like a combination of esperanto and microphone feedback.}
<C>__{kay }
<P>__{(to the aliens)}
<D>__{don't tell me we've only got that powdered shit for cream again?}
<A>__{one of the worm aliens answers him in their native tongue and points to the counter.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{he finds the cream sitting out on the counter where the alien indicated, dumps some in his coffee, and comes back outside, closing the door behind him. he reaches up and gently pushes edwards' jaw up, closing his mouth.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{for future reference, this is a better look for you.}
