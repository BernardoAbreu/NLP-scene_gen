<A>__{nick gets up slowly and whispers intensely to wanda, wolf, and the rest of the crew.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{roll camera. roll sound. let's go. right away.}
<A>__{wolf grabs the camera and puts it on his shoulder (hand held) as the rest of the crew moves quickly and silently into position. on a terse signal from nick the camera starts rolling.}

<A>__{nicole takes the silent "action" cue from nick.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i am so hungry.}
<A>__{right on cue cora walks through the door, holding the golden apple out in front of her. she circles nicole with determination, seemingly oblivious to nick and the rest of the crew hovering behind wolf as he begins following her with the hand held camera. wolf is now in his element; gliding like nureyev with the camera. when he pans suddenly with cora the whole crew ducks wildly and dives out of camera range. cora finally stops circling nicole and stops abruptly. suddenly she raises the apple right out in front of nicole. wolf glides forward with the camera, framing an amazing cu of the apple with nicole seen behind it. nicole reaches out, grabs the apple and takes a huge, resounding bite out of it. cu nick's face, eyes wide in anxious delight. cora takes one step forward. cu her fuzzy slippers stopping right on the yellow tape mark. cora waits momentarily until wolf has reframed both her and nicole, then lets out a huge laugh.}
