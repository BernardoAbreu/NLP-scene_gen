<L>__{35. back to scene}
<A>__{paul enters the room and jessica closes the door behind them.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{paul, this is the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam. she is going to... observe you...}
<P>__{(to reverend mother)}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{ }
<C>__{reverend mother}
<D>__{jessica, you know it must be done. i enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{your reverence.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{what does she fear?}
<P>__{(out loud)}
<D>__{what about my father?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{paul... please, paul... listen to the reverend mother and do what she tells you.}
<A>__{jessica leaves the room. the reverend mother speaks to paul using the voice, a bene gesserit training which permits an adept to control others merely by selected tone shadings of the voice. it sounds as if two people are talking one normal and the other gutteral and slightly electronic. the effect is strange, yet subtle.}
<C>__{reverend mother}
<P>__{(using the voice)}
<D>__{now you come here.}
<A>__{paul finds he cannot help but obey her, yet he fights her controlling him.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{she's using the voice.}
<P>__{(out loud)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she sees him struggling.}
<C>__{reverend mother}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{some strength there. surprising!}
<P>__{(out loud)}
<D>__{come here.}
<A>__{the reverend mother holds up a green metal cube.}
<C>__{reverend mother }
<D>__{see this... put your right hand in the box.}
<A>__{paul stares at the hole in the box. }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what's in the box?}
<C>__{reverend mother}
<D>__{pain.}
<A>__{just then, she raises one hand to his neck. paul sees a glint of metal. he tries to back away.}
<C>__{reverend mother }
<P>__{(the voice)}
<D>__{stop! put your hand in the box.}
<A>__{paul's hand goes in. fear passes over his face.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{the voice again.}
<C>__{reverend mother}
<D>__{i hold at your neck the gom jabbar. don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. a duke's son must know about many poisons this one kills only animals.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{are you suggesting a duke's son is an animal?}
<C>__{reverend mother}
<D>__{let us say i suggest you may be human. your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. if you do so you will die. you will feel an itching there... see? now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{it burns.}
<C>__{reverend mother}
<C>__{silence... silence.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(inner voice)(struggling to compose himself)}
<D>__{i must not fear. fear is the mind killer. fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. i will face my fear... i will permit it to pass over me and through me.}
<A>__{ the reverend mother moves her face up to his. her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. she is smiling.}
<C>__{reverend mother}
<D>__{you feel the flesh crisping?}
