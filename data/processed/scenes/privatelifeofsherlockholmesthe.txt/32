<L>__{exterior baker street night}
<A>__{the cabbie has tossed the blanket into the hansom, and is mounting the driver's seat. across the street, a man steps out of the fog into a pool of light cast by one of the street lamps. he is a craggy faced prussian of about fifty, and his name is von tirpitz. he looks up toward the holmes flat. as the hansom makes a u turn and comes abreast of him, he hops into the cab. the hansom disappears into the fog.}
