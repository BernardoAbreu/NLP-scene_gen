<D>__{this is new. all this. for the both of us. dealing with all this, just us. so i'm going to make this as clear and simple as i can: you're not friends with alice dainard. when i say no, i don't mean maybe. i don't mean yes. i mean no. i've known louis dainard for alotta years he's been nothing but trouble. your mother used to say he's not a bad guy, he just needs a chance, he's just sad well i tried to be good to him, but i can't. not anymore. i will not allow him or his daughter in this house. i will not allow you spending time with her, doing projects or whatever it is that you're doing. that's it. i hope we're clear.}
