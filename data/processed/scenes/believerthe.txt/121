<A>__{people are chanting avinu malkenu so fervently that the gunfire outside seems only a faint popping. no one particularly notices. danny, freaking, doesn't hear the gunshots. he tries to address the people in the front rows....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{wait a minute...}
<A>__{but the praying is too loud, too strong. no one stops or listens. he steps down off the bema....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{stop praying. you've got to get out of here.... all of you...}
<A>__{a few people in front are puzzled by his strange behavior, but the rest keep chanting. stuart comes up to danny....}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{you wanted to daven. now daven....}
<A>__{danny glances over people's heads at the clock: 7:25. he doesn't notice...}
<B>__{the door}
<A>__{bangs open. drake stands there, .357, bleeding profusely from the head, the swastika on his lips. at first, only a few people notice, they stop praying.}
<C>__{people}
<P>__{(panic, confusion)}
<D>__{who's that?... what is he...oh, my god...}
<A>__{avi is the first one out of his chair, walks right at drake.}
<C>__{avi}
<P>__{(calm, forceful)}
<D>__{put down the weapon. put it down....}
<A>__{drake shoots him. avi goes down, writhing in pain. screams, panic. people come at drake, but he grabs an 11 year old girl, puts the gun to her head.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{drake! up here...}
<A>__{everyone turns, including drake who's blinded by the blood in his eyes, but recognizes the voice.}
<C>__{enraged man}
<D>__{see, he knows him. the nazi bastard...}
<A>__{drake moves unsteadily toward the front, pulling the girl with him. a woman (a doctor) goes to tend avi, who is still conscious. people begin to slip out the back, taking children. others stay, looking to jump drake, but he keeps the .357 on the little girl.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(to carla, miriam, stuart)}
<D>__{get everybody out of here. fast.}
<A>__{he steps back onto the bema, separating himself from the others and drawing drake's attention. the clock reads 7:28. outside we begin to hear sirens....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{drake...}
<A>__{drake refocuses, pulls the girl on.... from the hall, we hear other groups in the building, chanting....}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{avinu malkenu, choney nu v'aneyenu... avinu malkenu, choney nu v'aneyenu, ki eyn banu ma asim...}
<P>__{(our father, out king, graciously answer us though we are undeserving...)}
<D>__{ nu va aneynu...}
<A>__{at the front, drake wobbles. people start forward. he cocks the gun against the little girl's head. she's weeping silently.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{drake, i'm right here....}
<A>__{drake looks. danny reaches out a hand. drake points the .357 at him and fires, missing. a hand grabs the little girl, pulls her to safety. the room is nearly empty now, save miriam, carla, stuart, a few others. the avinu malkenu can still be heard from the hall....}
<C>__{enraged man}
<P>__{(from the door)}
<D>__{let them kill each other. they're animals.}
<C>__{enraged wife}
<D>__{barry, for god's sake...}
<A>__{drake wobbles from loss of blood. nearly drops the .357. danny glances at the clock: 7:30. what is it, another dud?? drake fires again, hits danny in the shoulder....}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{danny!}
<A>__{she runs forward. the shoulder hurts; he calls to the others....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{get her out of here!}
<A>__{miriam, others, grab carla, pull carla toward the door. drake comes toward danny, trying to lift the .357 for the kill.}

<A>__{danny grabs drake's gun hand, forces it up in the air. the gun goes off. plaster rains down on them. drake dies. danny catches him under the arms. he looks at the watch: 7:32. he relaxes.}
