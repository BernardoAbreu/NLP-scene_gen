<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior u.t. lecture hall day}
<A>__{thirty animated students (circa 1992) are listening to david lecture. he's younger (31), vibrant looks like a grad student himself. on the white board behind him are phrases: "lucan," "objet petit a," "fantasy theory."}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{think. what do you fantasize about? world peace?}
<P>__{(as no one responds)}
<D>__{thought so.}
<P>__{(light laughter)}
<D>__{money fame ferrari?}
<P>__{(as some guys applaud}
<D>__{loudly; others then}
<P>__{boo them)}
<D>__{a pulitzer? nobel? m.t.v. music award?}
<P>__{(applause)}
<D>__{a genius hunk ostensibly bad but secretly simmering with noble passions, and willing to sleep on the wet spot?}
<A>__{as women applaud...}
<C>__{large woman}
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{i will take two!}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{a victoria's secret model just slumming between law school and running her family's vastly endowed foundation for tragically sad eyed children?}
<A>__{the crowd laughs, david changes tone.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{okay, good, you see lucan's pointerior fantasies must be unrealistic. the minute you get something, you don't, you can't, want it anymore. to exist, desire needs absent objects. so desire supports itself with crazy fantasies...}
<A>__{the over dressed sexy grad student enters loudly from a side door, out of breath and discombobulated. the crowd laughs at the timing. david pauses.}
<C>__{student}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{he animatedly gestures to the seats, waits a beat as she moves towards them.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{this is what pascal means when he says the only time we're truly happy is when day dreaming about future happiness.}
<A>__{the sexy student sits, adjusts herself.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{or why we say, 'the hunt is sweeter than the kill' or 'be careful what you wish for.'}
<A>__{a guy behind the sexy student taps her on the shoulder, she turns and he hands her letter from the registrar's office. it's from a girl friend two rows back. the girlfriend mouths, "it came today?"}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{not because you'll get it, but because you're doomed not to want it if you do. think about it next time you're at a wedding.}
<A>__{laughter. the sexy student turns back around, throws the letter in a book.}
