<A>__{carrie scans the landscape with her camera. she sees adele walking around a small roadside graveyard. she is reading the epitaphs on the headstones. carrie fires off a few shots. then she sees early, she can't help but notice early's lean body. she zooms in on his muscles and prison tattoo. click!! early completes the task. together he and brian begin putting everything back in the trunk. suddenly, from behind, adele jumps onto early's back, surprising him. he gives her a "horsey ride" around the lincoln.}
