<A>__{kym, stung, exhales a plume of smoke.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i've known the bride her entire life. not biblically, except for that one time we french kissed at evan yassky's party in the ninth grade.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{film! i want film!}
<A>__{whoops and hollers.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{commence embarrassing story.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{that wasn't it?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{rach, do you remember the time i was teaching you to drive in the wagoneer and you sideswiped that taxi driver and knocked off his side mirror?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i have no memory of that whatsoever.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{do you remember trying to outrun him and leading him on a high speed chase across 96th street?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{gotta say no.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{well i would like to share with everyone that miss rachel before she got her license or even had any idea how to drive out maneuvered an irate, screaming cab driver across 96th street to the east river, handily avoiding two emt guys loading an old lady on a gurney, while at the same time, applying cocofudge lip gloss in the rearview mirror.}
<A>__{bravos all around.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{wait, wait. she actually got the number of one of the e.m.t guys and went out with him. twice.}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{was that the guy with the peroxide hair?}
<A>__{abby, not looking at her daughter, shushes her.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{anyway, when the taxi driver finally caught up with us, rachel talked him down from his middle eastern fury in pretend farsi, and ended up using his radio thing to call his dispatcher and recommend this guy for a commendation.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{mahamoud! such a nice man.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{we were driving so fast! it was one of the more exhilarating moments in my life...sadly...but i knew that miss rachel would make it okay. so here's to you, my dear, dear friend. a woman who can drive fast, pick up a paramedic, make up languages and get you home in one piece. sidney, you are a lucky bastard.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{hear hear.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{where? where?}
<A>__{abby smiles broadly at rachel and blows her a kiss. kym rises with her glass and takes emma's place on stage. she glows in the candlelight.}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(for the crowd)}
<D>__{relax, it's seltzer.}
<A>__{low giggles.}
<C>__{kym }
<D>__{hello. i'm shiva the destroyer and your harbinger of doom for the evening. i want to thank you all for coming and welcome you even though i haven't seen most of you since my latest stretch in the big house...}
<A>__{scattered low giggles.}
<C>__{kym }
<D>__{you all look fabulous. during the twenty minutes i was not in the hole for making a shiv out of my toothbrush, i actually did participate in the infamous 12 step program. 12 steps. step ball change, step ball change. i'm still waiting for the change part.}
<A>__{some guests laugh. sidney grins. carol, paul, rachel, and abby sit silently. andrew moves in towards his wife.}
<C>__{kym }
<D>__{but as they say, relapse is an almost always inevitable component of recovery, god knows i've got high marks in that mode!}
<A>__{everyone is staring at kym.}
<C>__{kym }
<D>__{anyhoo, as more of you know than are likely to admit, one of the actual steps is about making amends.}
<C>__{kym }
<D>__{so i spent a lot of time calling up people who barely remembered me who barely remembered anything and apologizing to them for bouncing a check or passing out in the bathtub and flooding their house, or otherwise involving them in sordid activities they were desperately trying to forget. i had to call this one girl who was, i think, fourteen, but i couldn't talk to her because her mom took out a restraining order.}
<A>__{kym thinks this is hysterical. paul does not.}
<C>__{kym }
<D>__{anyway, i did a lot of apologizing to people who were practically strangers so i very much want to take this opportunity to not only congratulate my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in matters of the mind, thank you very much, and her adorable, impending husband on the occasion of their unprecedented nuptials.. but also to apologize to my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in matters of the mind, for... everything! and i really mean that, rachel. i've been a nightmare and you've been a sainterior i'm so damned glad i'm here with you and sidney and his family and ours, and i am so happy for you guys, i really am. so, i am hereby raising my seltzer in celebration of my laudatory sister and herewith making amends. sidney, you are robbing our dysfunctional family of one of it's most vital ingredients, and it's only member still willing to lend}
<P>__{me money. (she pauses for a second)}
<D>__{enjoy hawaii. la chaim.}
<A>__{she lifts her glass and downs it's contents. there is a smattering of applause.}
<C>__{kym }
<P>__{(to the group)}
<D>__{one down. what's for dessert?}
<A>__{kieran stares sympathetically at kym.}
