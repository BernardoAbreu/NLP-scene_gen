<T>__{camera on:}
<L>__{interior jimmy's house jimmy's bedroom day}
<A>__{camera's on a tripod. jimmy sits in a chair, the back of his shoulder foregrounds judy.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i'm not good on camera. it makes me nervous.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{forget about the camera. talk to me.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{tell me what you said earlier. about me about how you felt when you saw the video.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(relaxes)}
<D>__{it felt like someone had been reading my mind.}
<A>__{she stops.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{it was like someone had jumped into my head and watched what was being projected.}
<A>__{now judy completely has forgotten that the camera is there.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{and earlier, what you said about god.}
<A>__{jimmy zooms in the camera by remote. judy's distracted.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{tell me.}
<A>__{judy refocuses.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i said that it felt like god had sent someone to protect me, and to look out for me.}
<A>__{she looks at jimmy as if he is an angel.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{and i said that you are the only person in my life who has ever looked after me like that.}
<A>__{judy tries to stifle tears, but they're starting to flow again. as camera zooms in further, judy catches sight of jimmy's finger on the remote and blows her fucking top, leaping from her chair.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{god, i hate it when you film me crying!}
<A>__{judy goes for the camera, struggling to get it off the tripod, she finally frees it and points it at jimmy.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{how do you like it, huh? how do you like having a camera shoved right up your ass?}
<A>__{camera's framed poorly, moves around a lot, goes in and out of focus, etc.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{do you like it? do you?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i don't like it or dislike. i'm used to it.}
<A>__{judy moves the camera directly in his face. the lens is millimeters away from his nose. we see an extreme close up of his nostrils.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{generally i'd place the camera further away from my nose, but if this is your preferred shooting style then i guess i will have to adjust to it.}
<A>__{jimmy leans in and rests his nose on the lens.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{how's this work for you?}
<A>__{judy pulls back and continues filming him.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{give me a break.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{now judy's the interviewer. her framing is not quite as adept as jimmy's.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{so... why do you have to film everything?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i don't film everything.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{why do you like to film me crying?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i don't.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{then why do you?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{because it's rare that i get to find someone that lets their emotions go. when a person is crying, i mean truly crying, or truly laughing or smiling or frowning or gasping. for a few seconds or minutes i get a chance to see that person's soul. and really, now that you've forced me to think about it. i think it's a very rare and beautiful thing to be afforded that opportunity.}
<A>__{judy is shaken and speechless.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{anything else?}
<A>__{judy's moved and forgets herself. camera drops from jimmy.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{why me?}
<A>__{jimmy helps her put the camera back up on him.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{because.}
<A>__{jimmy sits still. judy doesn't know what to do with that.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{why do you think?}
<A>__{judy doesn't have an answer. jimmy reaches forward and takes the camera away from her and turns the interview around.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{why you and why me? why are we together right now?}
<A>__{judy doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{go ahead say it. i want you to. i know what you're going to say so just say it.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{stop.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{tell me.}
<A>__{judy fidgets.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(bullies her)}
<D>__{tell me!}
<A>__{judy fidgets again, then...}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(blows her top)}
<D>__{because we're both fucking weird!}
<A>__{judy pauses. the pressure of the camera from jimmy makes her feel like she has to give him more.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{because we're the two weirdest kids in the world. and god made us for each other and i fucking love you, and you did all this because you love me too, and fuck everyone and everything that doesn't get it!}
<A>__{judy's out of breath. camera still points at her.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{that's right, right?}
<A>__{judy stares back at the camera, longing for an answer from jimmy. she told him she loved him. camera shuts down.}
