<L>__{intercutting}
<A>__{now, while cinnabar is advancing towards her mother and father across the room patrick, at the wall, tries to place his ear near it in order to hear where the voice is coming from. while cinnabar is now within bones' reach. pearl steps back to allow jimmy to embrace cinnabar. they're reunited.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{welcome home, baby girl.}
<A>__{pearl watches as bones caresses his daughter's cheek. patrick now close to the wall trying to hear the faint voice calling to him.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{please...help me...}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{suddenly something enormous presses out from the wall. patrick stumbles back as his father's head and torso press out from the wall, stretched in straining effort.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{help me. i'm so sorry. but please, help me...}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{daddy?}
<A>__{jeremiah, or what he's become embedded into the wall, his face stretched, mouth huge and hollow eyes dripping bloody tears.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{please. help me. i'm scared.}
<A>__{patrick in anguish.}
<C>__{jeremiah }
<D>__{it hurts. i don't want to spend forever like this.}
<A>__{jeremiah's arm reaches out from the wall, grasping towards patrick, who reaches out to his father when suddenly with frightening speed jeremiah grabs it, and wrenches patrick to him, pulling patrick flush up against the wall, even starting to suck him in to the wall.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{no!!!}
<A>__{as patrick struggles and writhes and twists to get free from his father's grasp, he can see back across the room to the others. he sees the room as it really is he can see what's really happening. pearl, not in a new dress, but in a horrible tattered, blood encrusted old dress, standing next to a rotting cadaver that's stroking cinnabar's cheek and holding her close... jeremiah pulling patrick into the wall, into the necropolis itself. patrick, though, just as concerned with cinnabar as with himself, yelling at her across the crib.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{cinnabar! stop!}
<A>__{but cinnabar doesn't even turn her head. she just steps into her father's embrace. but pearl does seem to hear something. she looks back at patrick, beneath the illusion of the room she sees him being pulled into the awful wall, and can hear him more clearly now.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{no! cinnabar, no!!!!}
<A>__{slowly, pearl turns and looks into the mirror and she gets a full length view of herself: a woman in ruined tatters of her old, rotted dress. then, coming into her view in the mirror is her only daughter dancing with a decayed corpse.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{noooooo!}
<A>__{pearl whirls and rips cinnabar away from bones, who at first sort of chuckles to himself. but he stops laughing when pearl grabs the nearest candle and presses the flame to her breast. in a terrible whoosh, the dried old dress and pearl are engulfed in flames.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{noooooooooo!!!!!}
<A>__{bones runs to pearl and throws his arms around her, trying to smother the flames any way he can.}
<C>__{pearl}
<P>__{(to patrick and cinnabar)}
<D>__{get out!!! go!!!}
<A>__{cinnabar in a shattered daze on the floor, sees her mother in flames. patrick desperately tries to escape his father's death grip. finally, with horrible sound, patrick wrestles free from the wall, and from his father. he lurches free from them and makes it over to cinnabar and drags her out the door just as the room dissolves around them. as the flames destroy the dress and the last vestiges of bones' blood on it, the room begins to turn to ash. an eerie wind from nowhere begins to howl, blowing the ash and smoke from the dress and from the dissolving walls. cinnabar taking one last glance at the funeral pyre that was her mother and bones now, too, sees them almost lost in a shroud of flame and ash.}
<B>__{angle as}
<A>__{patrick and cinnabar run down the corridor and back down the stairs, the moon overhead and the flames from bones crib giving everything a flickering hellish cat. everything behind and above them crumbling to dust. the floor and then the stairs and all the howling bodies trapped inside.}
<B>__{on the first floor}
<A>__{they reach the open elevator shaft.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{we gotta jump!}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{i can't!}
<A>__{everything around them rumbling and crumbling.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{we have to!}
<A>__{patrick jumps and lands in the muddy ashes, dazed but unhurt.}
<B>__{looking up}
<A>__{he sees cinnabar peering over the edge in fear. then, behind her, he can hear a low rumbling growl. he sees cinnabar turn and scream ashes and falling debris then temporarily blind hen he wipes his eyes and looks up, cinnabar is gone from view.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{cinnabar! where are you!?}
<A>__{he immediately climbs back up the shaft when he sees cinnabar standing at the edge of the shaft above him.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{cinn! jump!!}
<A>__{and she jumps, landing right next to patrick, who quickly gets her to her feet.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{let's go!!!}
<A>__{they run out of the shaft and into the sub basement just as the elevator and shaft dissolve into ash. a hurricane wind blowing down and out of the shaft now. mixed with the sound of all the screaming, moaning souls in the necropolis. patrick in a fury to live tears away the boards and debris blocking the exit. he pulls cinnabar out with him and they walk up the cellar stairs, step into the dawn, weary, beaten down but not dead.}
