<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{two beautiful youths, lying asleep on a couch, by a table full with a half eaten meal. lestat sighs.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{oh, claudia, you've outdone yourself. where did you find them?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{drunk on brandy wine. a thimbleful. i thought of you when i saw them.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{we forgive each other then?}
<A>__{claudia stares at him, sitting. she nods. lestat bites into the neck of one of the youths, sucks greedily and horribly. claudia watches him without expression. he finished one, is about to take the other when he staggers. he looks at claudia.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{absinthe? you gave them absinthe?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{no. laudanum.}
<A>__{lestat stares wildly at her, tries to move towards her, then slips to the floor.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{laudanum!}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{yes. it killed them, unfortunately. but it keeps the blood warm.}
<A>__{lestat tries to rise.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{ah louis, louis, she killed them... and let me drink...}
<A>__{louis watches, appalled. he goes to move.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{don't louis }
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{louis, put me in my coffin...}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i will put you in your coffin. forever.}
<A>__{she pulls a knife out from under her shawl, walks rapidly to him and slashes his throat. blood explodes from it.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{claudia! don't do this thing!!!}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{louis, louis, i gave you the gift help me }
<A>__{claudia lacerates his face. blood pours from everywhere. she plunges the knife in his chest. he falls back, fangs bared, clutching the knife. claudia leaps on him then, bites deep into his neck as he dies. louis screams, runs forward, pulls her away.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what have you done, claudia }
<A>__{he drags her off lestat, tries to pull her out of the room. she hisses at him.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{louis! look what's happening to him!!}
<A>__{louis looks. the floor is a sea of blood. lestat has begun to shrivel, as if he'd been a bag of blood. his skin is shriveling against his bones like parchment, his eyes are slipping back into his skull like face. his lush, beautiful hair remains unchanged. but his clothes are virtually being emptied of the body. it is no more than bones, wrapped in paper and the pupils of the eyes suddenly roll up into the papered skull.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{lestat. oh, god forgive us.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{don't mock me, louis. help me.}
<A>__{she stares at the shriveled skeleton in its skin wrapping. she is fascinated. she sees the vampiric blood flow all over the floor. she touches it and brings her finger to her lips.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{goodnight, sweet prince, may flights of devils wing you to your rest.}
<A>__{louis walks forward, touches the skeleton, the blonde hair.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{he's dead, claudia, dead.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{the one good lesson he taught me, louis. never drink from the dead.}
<A>__{she stands up, all business suddenly.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{help me. we must get rid of him.}
<A>__{she drags the coverlet from the table, knocking the crockery over the dead youths, and wraps lestat's skeleton in it. she takes a bunch of chrysanthemums and places them in his skeleton hands.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{should we burn him? bury him? what would he have liked, louis?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{don't mock, claudia...}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{the swamp...}
