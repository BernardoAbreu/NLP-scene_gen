<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior constellation of orion night}
<A>__{stars glitter like diamonds on the black velvet backdrop of space. the belt of orion is center screen, but much nearer and larger than ever seen by an earth bound astronomer. a speck of light appears in the lower left corner of the screen. no spaceship can be seen, but only a glowworm, a solitary sperma tosoan gliding through the womb of the universe. over this we hear the voice of an astronaut. he is concluding a report.}
<C>__{astronaut's voice}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{so ends my last signal until we reach our destination. we are now on automatic, a mere hundred and five light years from our base ... and at the mercy of com puters. i've tucked in my crew for the long sleep. i will join them presently.}
<L>__{interior cabin of spaceship establishing shot night}
<A>__{the cabin is neither cramped nor spacious, but about the size of the president's cabin in air force one. in the immediate f.g. is a console of dials and switches flanked by four chairs. only one of the chairs is occupied. the astronaut's back is to camera. there is a ladder amidships which leads to an escape hatch. the after dart of the cabin is obscured in darkness. we hear the music of a mozart sonata emanating from a phonograph of stereotape. the astronaut is speaking into a microphone.}
<C>__{astronaut}
<D>__{within the hour we shall complete the sixth month of our flight from cape kennedy. by our time, that is ...}
<A>__{he pauses, looking up at:}
<L>__{3 two large clocks on cabin wall}
<A>__{one clock is marked self time, but instead of twelve numerals it has twenty four. one of the needles is moving very slowly. the other clock is labeled earth time, and its units, like those of a tachometer, are given by hundreds and thousands. the largest needle of this clock makes one revolution every second. over this we hear:}
<C>__{astronaut's voice}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{but according to dr. hasslein theory of time in a vehicle traveling at close to the speed of light, old mother earth has aged a few thousand years since our de parture while we have scarcely aged at all.}
<L>__{4 close on astronaut}
<A>__{this is taylor. he wears simple dungarees (or churchill suit) and comfortable boots. he seems calm and pensive. extracting the butt of a cigar from the breast pocket of his dungarees, he lights it, then continues:}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{it may be so. this much is probable: the men who sent us on this journey have long since been moldering in forgotten graves; and those, if any, who read this message are a different breed. hopefully, a better one.}
<A>__{he begins to roll up his left sleeve.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i leave the twentieth century without regret. who was it? marshall? ... said 'modern man is the missin 'a link between the ape and the human being.'}
<A>__{he removes the cigar from his mouth, turns to look out through one of the portholes into the astral night.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{one final thought nothing scientific, purely personal. seen from up here, everything looks different ... time bends and space is boundless. it squashes a man's ego. he begins to feel like no more than a mote in the eye of eternity. and he is nagged by a question: ahat if any thing, will greet us on the end of man's first journey to a star? are we to believe that throughout these thousands of galaxies, these millions of stars, only one, that speck of solar dust we call earth, has been graced or cursed by human life?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i have to doubt it.}
<A>__{he extracts a hypodermic needle from his breast pocket and injects it into the vein of his forearm. he continues speaking.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(sardonically)}
<D>__{that's about all. i wonder if man, that marvel of the universe, that glorious paradox who has sent me to the unknown... still makes war against his brother., and lets his neighbor's children starve.}
<A>__{taylor withdraws the hypodermic needle from his vein and secures it in a drawer of the console.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{well then, earthmen: a missing link salutes you. bless you, my descendants.}
<A>__{taylor snuffs out the cigar butt and places it in the drawer beside the hypodermic. then, flicking a switch au cut off the mozart, he rises and looks up again at:}
<L>__{5 the clock marked earth time}
<A>__{the longest needle of this clock now makes nearly two revolutions per second. the shortest needle points to the numeral 2105.}
<L>__{interior cabin tracking with taylor}
<A>__{space scientists have presumably solved the problem of weightlessness, for taylor walks the short distance from; the console to the after section without particular effort. camera follows him, and we can now see four glass capsules, or "caskets", in the rear of the cabin. taylor looks down at them.}
<L>__{7 several shots the four caskets from taylor's p.o.v. 10}
<A>__{one of them is open. the other three are occupied by astronauts: dodge, landon and stewart. they, too, wear dungarees and boots. dodge and landon are thirtyish, clean shaven, virile america's finest. stewart is a handsome young woman, her hair bobbed short. their eyes are closed and they do not appear to be breathing yet no undertaker could make them so alive.}
<L>__{11 another angle favoring taylor}
<A>__{he grasps the handle of his own casket and slowly pulls himself into it. continuing silence. camera moves in as taylor dulls the glass lid shut and secures it. he adjusts two dials inside the capsule and lies back, buckling his safety belt. camera moves into a closeup of taylor. his eyes are open. he seems serene, even enraptured. (note: credits will appear here over a series of shots designed to convey a sense of loneliness, of separation, and of the passage of time.)}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{12 a series of shots a distant globe (miniature) 16}
<A>__{we see a strange and distant planet. at first the globe occupies but a small area of the screen; but with each new view it comes closer and looms larger, as if" observed from a spaceship in a spiraling orbit of descent. the topography of the planet bears little resemblance to our own. much of it is obscured by cloud cover; even more of it appears to be cratered desert of reddish hue. we can, however, make out a few narrow "green belts" and a patch of blue water. in the final shots of this sequence we see the strange planet as it would be observed from a spacecraft plummeting from twenty thousand feet to one thousand feet. it appears that the ship will fall into a vast lake surrounded by soaring sandstone pinnacles. the water is blue black, the pinnacles vermillion. (this is the lake powell location, at lone rock.)}
<L>__{interior spaceship full shot day}
<A>__{four empty pilot seats are seen in f.g., the four glass caskets in b.g. we hear the rhythmic bleat of a warning signal, a rush of wind as in a rapid descent, and perhaps the roar of retrojets. then, a great crash as the craft hits water. the whole ship shudders on impact. loose equipment falls to the cabin floor. camera moves down the cabin aisle as the ship begins to roll in the water and holds on the four glass caskets. there are three loud metallic clicks as the glass domes of the caskets swing open automatically.}
<L>__{18 close on taylor}
<A>__{he now has a full beard. his eyes come open. instantly alert, he rises to a sitting position, gazing across at:}
<L>__{19 dodge and landon from taylor's p.o.v.}
<A>__{they, too, awaken and sit up, starring at taylor. they, too, are bearded.}

<A>__{its dome remains unopened. the young woman is a skeleton in a churchill suit.}
<L>__{22 reaction shot the three astronauts}
<A>__{dodge and landon have joined taylor and stare at the grinning skull of their dead comrade. a low, descending hum of equipment is heard. simultaneously the lights begin to fade. a moment later they brighten, but not as much as before.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{there goes our primary power. we're on auxilliary.}
<A>__{a slight cracking sound is heard. taylor turns quickly away and o.s.:}
<L>__{23 reverse angle the forward cabin}
<A>__{a trickle of water has begun to seep through a ruptured seam in the cabin. taylor darts to a porthole and peers cut.}
<L>__{24 long shot what taylor sees:}
<A>__{water the porthole is no more than six inches above the line. in the distance we discern a shoreline of red desert.}
<C>__{taylor's voice}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{we're in the soup. we're sinking.}
<L>__{interior cabin full shot}
<A>__{the leak in the seam becomes a growing spray of water. taylor turns away from the porthole, calling:}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{dodge! read the atmosphere!}
<A>__{dodge moves instantly to the ladder beneath an escape hatch and mounts it. taylor stumbles down the aisle of the rolling ship toward the console and addresses landon, who is still staring at stewart's skeleton.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{landon! send a last signal.}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(dazed)}

<L>__{exterior tim strange planet long panoramic shot late afternoon (lone}
<A>__{rock, lake powell) we are looking at a lifeless desert of sandstone buttes and pinnacles. there is no sign of vegetation anywhere. camera pans down to a body of water that could be the bay of an inland sea. the deep blue of the sea contrasts sharply to the red sands of the shoreline. camera holds on the stricken spaceship, wallowing like a beached whale a hundred yards offshore. the portholes of the craft are beneath the water, and only its roof and the tail fin of its tail assembly are visible. the red hot skin of the ship vaporizes the water around it. suddenly a snorkel like tube sprouts from the escape hatch, which is located amidships.}
<L>__{interior cabin close on closed escape hatch}
<A>__{dodge, standing halfway up the ladder., has fastened a kit of gauges to the end of the snorkel tube. he reads the dials, removes the kit, sniffs the air in the tube and then, taking a deep breath, announces:}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{it's breathable.}
<C>__{taylor's voice}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{okay! blow the hatch before we lose auxilliary power.}
<A>__{dodge reaches for a control mechanism near the escape hatch.}
<L>__{28 close on taylor and landon}
<A>__{the spray of water coming through the ruptured seam is increasing. the lights dim again and the sound of the warning signal fades. while landon fiddles with the radio, taylor tries to get the tape recorder rolling, but all we hear are scrambled and unintelligible noises.}

<D>__{it's no use ... there she goes.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{forget it. abandon ship.}
<L>__{29 wider angle tim cabin}
<A>__{the escape hatch is now open. taylor darts over to the ladder and passes a folded life raft up to dodge. when landon reaches the ladder, taylor hands him two neatly packed rucksacks, and landon climbs through the escape hatch. taylor is about to follow with a third rucksack, then turns and crosses the cabin for a last look at:}
<L>__{30 the two clocks from taylor's p.o.v.}
<A>__{both clocks have stopped: the red needle of the clock labeled self time rests on the numeral 18; the red needle of the clock marked earth time rests on the numeral 3975.}
<L>__{exterior top of spacecraft med. shot}
<A>__{dodge inflates the raft with a cartridge of compressed air and tosses it into the water. he and landon jump into the water and climb onto the raft as taylor emerges from the hatch, taylor slips into the water and climbs onto the raft. he and landon begin to paddle toward shore, while dodge immediately opens another kit and takes a sample of the water.}

<D>__{take your soil test, dodge. i will check the equipment.}
<A>__{dodge moves inland about ten yards, removes a small hand drill from his belt, extends the rod of the drill three feet and begins to take some subsoil samplings. taylor begins to examine the contents of the three rucksacks. landon sits down on the beach., hands around his knees, gazing moodily at the sunken spaceship. during this and succeeding scenes we sense that dodge's obsession with scientific inquiry leaves him immune to fear: landon is possibly more courageous and certainly more "human," for he has many fears to control: while taylor detached, cool and misanthropic is something of an enigma.}

<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{why? from the first, i've terrified you, doctor. and in spite of every sign that i'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. why?}
<C>__{zaius}
<P>__{(calmly, without rancor)}
<D>__{because you are a man. and you were right i have always known about man. from the evidence, i believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. his emotions must rule his brain. he must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him even himself.}

<D>__{i may just have saved it for you.}
<A>__{julius and zira look at each other, befuddled. once more their eyes follow the retreating figures of taylor and nova. the beach separating the water from the canyon becomes narrower as they move downstream.}

<A>__{taylor and nova are already far downstream. there is a striking change in the terrain. the area is still desolate,but some vegetation can be seen on the palisade above the narrow beach, and the river has widened to form a vast tidal basin where it meets the sea. a note on production: if feasible at new location site, this scene should be shot at high tide, so that the water laps at the base of the cliffs, making a passage difficult and risky.}

<L>__{416 back to taylor and nova}
<A>__{frowning with concern, taylor gazes for a moment at the smoke, then decides this is no time to linger. he digs his heels into the horse's flanks and they move off at a canter, riding toward the promontory that splits the beach. they are nearing the promontory that blocks their view of the beach beyond.}

<L>__{421 the strange formation as seen by taylor}
<A>__{an immense column juts from the beach at a thirty degree angle. we can now see that it is not rock, but metal. green metallic tints show through its gray salt stained surface. as we draw closer, the object takes on the appearance of a massive arm, its top shaped like a hand holding a torch.}

<L>__{423 tracking with taylor what he sees:}
<A>__{near the base of the column, where the shore and water meet, are a row of metal spikes. from this angle they look like tank traps. a 423 closer taylor dumbfounded, he slides from his saddle, approaches the spikes. nova dismounts and follows him.}

<P>__{(a cry of agony)}
