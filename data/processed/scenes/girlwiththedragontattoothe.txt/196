<A>__{she turns the bathtub's hot water tap }
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{is it still bleeding?}
<P>__{(touches the wound)}
<D>__{it's still bleeding ... why is it still bleeding ...}
<A>__{she pulls a length of dental floss from its case }
<C>__{blomkvist }
<D>__{is that dental floss?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{splits it in two thinner lengths with her chewed finger nails feeds one of the lengths of floss through the eye of a needle }
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{what is that }
<P>__{(he can see it's a needle)}
<D>__{is that necessary?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{we can't just tape it?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she perches on the edge of the tub where he sits still in his pants half submerged in tepid water bottle of vodka in his hand.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{did you sterilize that?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{you didn't?}
<A>__{she splashes some of the vodka on the needle. most of it goes in the water. hands the bottle back to him.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{drink some more.}
<A>__{he takes a swig from the vodka bottle. she reaches to his face with the needle and floss }
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{careful, it's my eye.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{don't move.}
<A>__{it takes all he's got not to move, and even that isn't enough as she first sticks the needle through the flesh. he pulls away with a groan. she just looks at him. waits for him to take another swig of vodka to steel himself. she pierces him a second time, draws the floss through the skin. and after that it doesn't seem to be so bad. as she works, his eyes glance to hers with a mixture of dread and gratitude, but hers are focused on the work. hers then briefly glance to his, but now his are down.}
