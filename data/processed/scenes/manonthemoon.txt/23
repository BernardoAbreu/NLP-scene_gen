<L>__{interior soho health food restaurant night}
<A>__{a bohemian health food restaurant, staffed by hippie waitresses in sandals. andy and george sit together, trying to get a sense of each other.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{you see, i want to be the biggest star in the world.}
<A>__{george is surprised at this hubris.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{people love... comedians.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i'm not a comedian. i have no talent.}
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<D>__{i'm a song and dance man.}
<A>__{george looks up at andy and inexplicably there is a giant moist booger hanging from andy's nostril. george cringes. he doesn't know what to say. a waitress brings over two plates of awful 70's health food seaweed, beans, stringy paste. george frowns. andy beams.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{mmm! i particularly recommend the lotus root.}
<A>__{andy pulls out a little handi wipe and cleanses his hands. then he starts arranging the food in compulsive little piles: beans in pinwheel shapes. sprouts in piles. george peers at the bizarre food behavior.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you show a lot of promise... but... my concern is i don't know where to book you. you're not a stand up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(bright)}
<D>__{i've always wanted to play carnegie hall.}
<A>__{george is unsure if that's a joke.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yeah, ha ha. that's funny.}
<A>__{andy dips his silverware in the water glass. two dunks, then he dries it with his napkin. george stares, perplexed. he looks back up and andy's booger has suddenly switched nostrils. huh?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{see, i don't want easy laughs.}
<A>__{andy's about to eat but first bows his head in silent prayer. george raises an eyebrow. andy snaps his head back up.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{i want gut reactions! i want that audience to go through an experience. they love me! they hate me! they walk out it's all great!}
<A>__{andy triumphantly eats a bean. george peers, unable to take the booger anymore. he hands andy a napkin and points to his nose. andy nods, removes the rubber booger, and carefully puts it in a little box.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{after i'm famous, i can sell these as "worn by andy kaufman."}
<A>__{and at that... george is won over. he smiles broadly.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you're insane.}
<P>__{(then sincere)}
<D>__{but you might also be brilliant. alright, andy... let's do it.}
<A>__{george warmly extends his hand. andy slowly smiles, then takes george's hand. the men shake. a moment of supreme importance. est. beverly hills day the glitz strip of los angeles. money. beauty.}
