<L>__{interior church tent, new orleans a saturday night, 1926}
<A>__{a sweltering shout 'em up negro gospel tent. queenie pushes benjamin in his wheelchair past a line of people looking to be healed, bringing him face to face with a mountain of a preacher, pouring sweat and full of fire...}
<C>__{the preacher}
<D>__{what can i do for you, sister?}
<A>__{and queenie whispers something to him.}
<C>__{the preacher }
<D>__{her parts are all twisted up inside so she can't have little children...}
<A>__{he puts his hand on her stomach...}
<C>__{preacher}
<D>__{lord, if you could see clear to forgive this woman her sins so she can bear the fruit of the womb.}
<P>__{(and shouts)}
<D>__{out damnable affliction!}
<A>__{he presses on her stomach... making queenie nearly fall over... held up by a "nurse" in a crisp white uniform. and once she's regained her balance...}
<C>__{the preacher}
<P>__{(at benjamin)}
<D>__{and what's this old man's irrediction?}
<C>__{queenie}
<D>__{he's got the devil on his back... trying to ride him into the grave before his time...}
<C>__{the preacher}
<P>__{(touches benjamin)}
<D>__{out, zebuchar! out, beelzebub!}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{how old are you?}
<A>__{and he says what is only true.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{i'm seven, but i look a lot older.}
<C>__{preacher}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{god bless you. he's seven!}
<A>__{the congregation laughs...}
<C>__{the preacher}
<D>__{this is a man who has optimism in his heart! belief in his soul! we are all children in the eyes of god. now we are going to get you out of that chair... we're gonna have you walk...}
<P>__{(his hands on ben's shoulders)}
<D>__{in the name of god's glory, rise up!}
<A>__{and benjamin, doing what he's asked, barely able to, his legs akimbo, stands... the people all applaud...}
<C>__{the preacher }
<D>__{now god is going to see you the rest of the way... he's going to see this little old man walk without the use of a crutch or a cane...! he's going walk by himself on faith and divine inspiration alone...! we'll show that devil where to go...! walk on...!}
<A>__{and benjamin takes two very precarious steps and his poor arthritic legs give out... and he sprawls to the floor... the aides in white nurse's uniforms move to help, but:}
<C>__{the preacher }
<D>__{don't touch him!}
<P>__{(kneeling to benjamin)}
<D>__{rise up, old man!}
<A>__{but benjamin stays crumpled on the floor... the preacher comes to his feet, standing like a mountain over him...}
<C>__{the preacher }
<D>__{rise up like lazarus!}
<A>__{benjamin still lies on the floor...}
<C>__{the preacher }
<D>__{i said rise up!!}
<A>__{and benjamin, slowly but surely, makes his way to his feet...}
<C>__{the preacher }
<D>__{yes, and say hallelujah!}
<P>__{(hallelujah!)}
<D>__{now walk, my old friend... walk on...!}
<A>__{and benjamin, one crippled leg at a time, hobbles across the stage... the people urging him on... a string of "hallelujahs...!" queenie comes to join him... urging him...}
<C>__{queenie}
<D>__{let the lord carry you... ...}
<A>__{...the preacher, walking along with him, more a dance than a walk, shouting the name of the lord... queenie and the preacher walking benjamin across the stage... benjamin making it to the other end... to a roar of "amens"!}
<C>__{benjamin button's }
<D>__{now, when i look back on it, it was kind of miraculous... but you know the saying, "...the lord giveth and the lord taketh away..."}
<A>__{... that mountain of a preacher... in full exaltation to god...}
<C>__{the preacher}
<D>__{praise be to the lord on the highest...!}
<A>__{suddenly pitches over, flat on his face... having had a spontaneous coronary... lying center stage, deader than the proverbial doornail... the crisp uniformed "nurses" running to attend to him, and poor "old" benjamin haplessly looking around.}
