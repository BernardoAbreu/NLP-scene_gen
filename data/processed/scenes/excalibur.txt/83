<L>__{interior chapel day}
<A>__{a chorus of children sings. the bishop waits at the altar with his friars and altar boys. cornucopias overflowing with vegetables and wildflowers adorn the church, which glows with the light of a thousand candles. sir kay is satisfied. he comes back up the petal strewn aisle.}
<L>__{exterior chapel, site of the sword in the stone day}
<A>__{arthur and guenevere are ushered in by kay. they are flanked by leondegrance and sir ector. lancelot and merlin follow, leading the cortege of knights and ladies. merlin is incapable of entering the chapel, as if at the threshold there is an unseen force that repels him.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{lord merlin, are you ill?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{no, no, i need air.}
<A>__{strangling a laugh he wrenches himself away. just then uryens and a small party of knights rides up through the tents and dismounts in front of the church. uryens helps a lady off her horse and joins the cortege on foot.}
<C>__{uryens}
<D>__{merlin, don't you join the celebration?}
<A>__{merlin, who was slinking away through the throng of bystanders, looks up. what he sees sends a chill through his body. at uryens' side stands a young woman of sinister beauty, with bewitching eyes of ice. merlin just stares at her, and she smiles back at him faintly.}
<C>__{uryens}
<D>__{my wife, merlin. lady morgana of cornwall.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{i remember you, merlin. i was a child. you took my brother away.}
<A>__{merlin laughs. uryens shrugs and continues into the chapel with morgana. as she enters she glances back, and just then merlin steals a look, their eyes meet.}
