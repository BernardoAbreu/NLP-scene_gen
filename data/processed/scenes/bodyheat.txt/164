<D>__{... mary ann and i left wheaton together and went to chicago. we didn't know what we were doing. i got in bad trouble with drugs. speed. really bad. i did things...}
<P>__{(she looks up at him)}
<D>__{whatever's the evilest thing you can think of me now, i did worse things then. there's nothing lower than the animal i was then. worse than you can imagine. i thought i would die. i prayed i would... and then a man helped me. he got me clean. he didn't want much in return, either... he was a lawyer and he put me to work in his office. i learned a lot there. one time i even thought i might go to law school. ... that's where i picked up the business about making a will invalid. that happened to him once. i swear i would never have used that if i'd known about your case... i was afraid to tell you, ned. i knew you wouldn't let me do it. i'm greedy, like you said. i wanted us to have it all.}
