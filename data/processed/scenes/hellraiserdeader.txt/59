<A>__{amy comes down the stairs. no sign of life. the fluorescent lights flicker some dead. amy fumbles for her metro card. this is one of those unattended entrances with entry through the top to bottom turnstiles. she starts through the turnstile. then with a squeak, it sticks and she finds herself stuck half way through, unable to move forward or backward. she tries to back out, but the thing won't turn in that direction. she heaves forward. it finally gives way. she looks this way and that, back through the turnstile, she sees her bloody footprints leading all the way through. amy hears footsteps echoing towards her. through a large mirror at an intersection, she sees the source of the footsteps. a cop on the beat. amy looks down and sees she is standing in a pool of her own blood. the footsteps get louder. she sees a stack of newspapers next to her on a stand. she grabs one and throws it down in front of herself to cover the blood. it soaks threw in no time. the cop is nearing the corner. she grabs another, then another, and throws them down. the pool of her blood leaks from under them all. the cop rounds the corner, he has a baton he taps against his leg. amy grabs the whole stand and tips it over. with a loud smash, it spills the newspaper everywhere. as the cop walks in front of amy, the blood is hidden beneath the pile of newspapers. amy bends down to attend to the mess. she makes eyes with the cop and shrugs her shoulders at her "mistake". the cop smiles and nods, and keeps on walking. the sound of his footsteps vanish down the corridors. amy collects herself with a few deep breaths, and moves on towards the platform.}
