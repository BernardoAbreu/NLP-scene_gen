<L>__{interior slum apartment, adjoining room morning}
<A>__{the blond cop enters, gun trained, looks around in confusion. the room's tables, chairs and floor are covered with hundreds of colorful, plastic air fresheners.}
<L>__{interior slum apartment, main room morning}
<A>__{somerset moves in, looks around. he notices the area around the bed, the ceiling, walls and floor, has been painted indigo, while the rest of the room is its original white. on a wall, a white sheet is pinned up with a square drawn on it in excrement.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i said get up, sleepyhead!}
<A>__{mills pulls the indigo blanket off the bed, reveals the shriveled, sore covered form of a black man who is blindfolded and tied to the bed with a thin wire wrapped time and time again around the bed. tubes lead from the stained loincloth around the man's waist and snake under the bed. the victim is partially covered by what seem to be piles of black spaghetti.}
<C>__{california}
<D>__{oh, fuck me!}
<A>__{somerset pushes past the cops who recoil from the stench.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{sloth... it's sloth.}
<A>__{the black cop touches the black spaghetti. holds a piece.}
<C>__{black cop}
<D>__{what the hell... those are dead worms.}
<C>__{california}
<P>__{(to somerset)}
<D>__{check this out, dick.}
<A>__{california points with his gun to the end of the black man's right arm. the hand is gone, severed at the wrist long ago.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{it's him. it's zero.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{someone call an ambulance.}
<C>__{california}
<D>__{someone call a hearse, more like.}
<A>__{the female cop has gone to the wall where the sheet is pinned up. she pulls the sheet aside and finds: fifty two polaroid pictures; all pictures of zero tied to the bed, with a date written at the bottom of each. it is a visual history of zero's physical decay. the blond cop enters from the other room.}
<C>__{blond cop}
<D>__{what the fuck is going on?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{hey, california. get your people out.}
<A>__{somerset takes out rubber gloves and puts them on.}
<C>__{california}
<D>__{you heard him. hit the hall, and don't touch anything.}
<A>__{the other cops file out as mills goes to examine the polaroids under the sheet. somerset replaces the sheet over zero's body. california stays by his side.}
<C>__{california }
<D>__{it looks like he's some kind of friggin' wax sculpture.}
<A>__{somerset places his finger along zero's throat.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{somerset, you... you better look here.}
<A>__{mills studies the polaroids. somerset walks to join him.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{all pictures of zero tied to the bed.}
<P>__{(crouches)}
<D>__{the last one's dated three days ago.}
<A>__{somerset looks at the first photo. in it, zero is bound and gagged, but he is fit, healthy.}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(awed)}
<D>__{the first photo... it's dated one year ago. almost to the day.}
<A>__{california lifts zero's blanket to peek under, examining with morbid curiosity.}
<C>__{california}
<D>__{mo ther...}
<A>__{mills kneels and lifts the bottom of the sheet off the floor, finds an open shoebox. on the box: to the detectives.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{what's this?}
<A>__{california leans close to zero's gaunt, blindfolded face.}
<C>__{california}
<D>__{you got what you deserved, zero.}
<A>__{somerset leans down beside mills. mills looks through the shoebox. inside are plastic, zip lock bags. one bag contains small clumps of hair, one contains a yellow liquid...}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{a urine sample... hair sample... fingernail clippings. he's laughing at us.}
<A>__{california is still close to zero's face when suddenly zero's lips twist. zero lets out a loud, guttural bark. california jerks back in fear, shouting, falling over a chair. mills and somerset reel, standing. they see california on the ground, scared out of his mind, pointing.}
<C>__{california}
<D>__{he's alive!}
<A>__{mills and somerset look towards the bed. zero's lips move feebly as he lets out a sick, gurgling moan.}
<C>__{california}
<D>__{he's still alive!}
