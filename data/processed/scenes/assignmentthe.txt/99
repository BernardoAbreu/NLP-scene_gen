<A>__{jack is in the car with amos, who drives, and ramirez. ramirez has a bandage across his nose. he has black eyes from plastic surgery. jack hands ramirez a small bundle which he opens. inside is a black t shirt and black jeans.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what you'll wear from now on. black t shirt and jeans... it's the only thing carlos ever wears whenever he's not out being a terrorist. it's the opposite of what he was forced to wear as a child... you know... the school uniforms, the white tight collared shirts... it's become like a fetish for him.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{and to match your new wardrobe, in another two days your bandages will come off and you'll get to show your beautiful new nose to carla.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{who's carla?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she's a venezuelan. she was carlos' main squeeze about fifteen years ago. she'll put the finishing touches on the act.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{why's one of carlos' girlfriends helping us?}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{carlos used her... like he uses a lot of women. she emigrated to israel. now she wants to get even.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{what do you mean used her. how?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he put her on an airplane with a bomb in her suitcase. she would have gone up with everything else. what's that song say? there are fifty ways to leave your lover? make that fifty one.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{she's about thirty seven... still attractive.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so it's not gonna be a hardship.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{what's not gonna be a hardship?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{making love to her.}
<A>__{ramirez looks at jack in shock.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{annibal... the way in is a woman... her name is agnieska. it's part of the trap. the kgb will be watching her... we'll make sure of that... she's a more recent girlfriend of carlos... but they've got to be convinced and so does she. carlos, you, are going to ask her to do something. she has to believe you're him or she won't risk it.}
<A>__{ramirez just looks at him, as if cheating on his wife was obviously not part of the bargain.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what the fuck are you lookin' at? you're gonna help murder this guy, you draw the moral line at extramarital sex?}
<A>__{ramirez is quiet.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't think of it as cheating. think of it as fucking for the flag.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{"when in doubt, close your eyes and think of england."}
