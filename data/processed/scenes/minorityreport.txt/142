<L>__{exterior the street.}
<A>__{even as anderson rushes out of the boarding house, the workers have lost their grip on the window. the little boy in the blue hat and his mother walk unwittingly toward disaster. they do not appear to hear the men's cries. the window falls end over end above the boy's head. the sunlight sparks off of the glass, so that from a distance it looks like a star falling from the sky. a woman across the street sees what is happening, and cries out. but what anderson does is run. he runs faster and harder than humanly possible. he does not care if he is recognized or hit by a passing taxi. he is going to get to that boy. he has to get to that boy ... anderson rams the boy from behind just as the corner of the window frame kisses the boy's blue hat. he knocks the boy to safety as glass and metal smash into the sidewalk. the mother does not even have time to scream. she is on the ground, stunned, but anderson has saved the boy. he rolls away, and gets to his feet. before anyone can put together what has happened, anderson has ducked into an alley, and is gone.}
