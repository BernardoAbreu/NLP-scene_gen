<L>__{interior the rose theatre. stage auditorium. day.}
<A>__{onstage, the rehearsal continues. wessex strides in. among the audience are henslowe, a few actors...and john webster...who sees wessex and jumps up and goes to him.}
<C>__{webster}
<D>__{my lord!}
<A>__{wessex knocks him aside and continues.}
<C>__{wessex}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{shakespeare!}

<C>__{wessex }
<D>__{you upstart inky pup! now i will show you your place, which is in hell!}

<D>__{you are on my ground.}

<D>__{by god, i will fight the lot of you}
<A>__{will draws his sword.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i am more than enough.}
<A>__{viola reacts. she almost gives herself away. but the fight has started. wessex slashes at will. will knows how to fight. he parries and thrusts. wessex is surprised. the fight goes fast and furious around the stage, until will thrusts accurately at wessex's chest...and would have killed him but for the button on his sword pointerior wessex grapples with him, and now it becomes a parody of the hamlet duel; wessex's unbuttoned sword falls to the ground, will puts his foot on it, tosses wessex his own safe sword, picks up wessex's sword and continues the fight until he has wessex at his mercy. will has fought with a passionate rage that has everybody staring at him. now the look in his eyes is merciless.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{absent friends!}
<P>__{(to the assembly)}
<D>__{this is the murderer of kit marlowe!}
<A>__{ned alleyn comes forward looking worried and dubious.}
<C>__{alleyn}
<D>__{will}
<C>__{wessex}
<D>__{i rejoiced at his death because i thought it was yours. that is all i know of marlowe.}
<C>__{alleyn}
<D>__{it's true, will it was a tavern brawl...marlowe attacked, and got his own knife in the eye. a quarrel about the bill}
<C>__{henslowe}
<D>__{the bill! oh, vanity, vanity!}
<C>__{alleyn}
<D>__{not the billing, the bill!}
<A>__{will steps back, and sinks to his knees. his relief could not be greater.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(to the heavens)}
<D>__{oh god, i am free of it!}
<A>__{wessex gets to his feet. tilney enters the auditorium from the public entrance.}

<D>__{close it!}
<C>__{tilney}
<D>__{my lord wessex!}
<C>__{wessex}
<P>__{(foaming)}

<A>__{wessex storms out past the bewildered tilney.}
<C>__{henslowe}
<D>__{mr. tilney, what is this?}
<C>__{tilney}
<D>__{sedition and indecency!}

<C>__{webster}
<D>__{master of the revels, sir, over here, sir.}

<C>__{webster}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{i saw her bubbies!}
<C>__{tilney}
<P>__{(shocked and gratified)}
<D>__{a woman on the stage? a woman?}
<C>__{webster}
<D>__{i swear it!}
<A>__{the company of actors are dumbstruck. none more than}
<B>__{viola.}
<C>__{tilney}
<D>__{so, henslowe! i say this theatre is closed! on the authority of the powers invested in my by the court i close this theatre!}
<C>__{henslowe}
<D>__{why so?}
<C>__{tilney}
<P>__{(triumphantly)}
<D>__{for lewdness and unshamefacedness! for displaying a female on the public stage!}
<A>__{tilney is unstoppable. he jumps on the stage...and seizes sam gosse. before webster or anyone can intervene, tilney pulls up his skirt, ignoring sam's rather gutteral yell of protest and pulls down sam's drawers. tilney's face is a study. so is everybody else's. webster rolls his eyes (oh, these stupid grown ups!) and deftly throws one of his mice onto "romeo's" hair. viola gives a shrill scream, the startled mouse descends her neck via viola's ear, and seeks an entry into her collar. by which time viola has gone berserk and torn off her wig. her hair is pinned up but there is no question her gender. will is paralysed. viola gives him a look of terrible despair and apology.}
<C>__{webster}
<P>__{(pointing at sam)}
<D>__{not him.}
<P>__{(pointing at viola)}
<D>__{her.}
<C>__{henslowe}
<D>__{he's a woman!}
<A>__{by now the scene is playing to a crowded theatre, or so it seems.}
<C>__{tilney}
<D>__{that's who i meant! this theatre is closed! notice will be posted!}
<A>__{sam has picked himself up, and his drawers.}
<C>__{henslowe}
<P>__{(to ned)}
<D>__{ned, i swear i knew nothing of this!}
<C>__{viola}
<P>__{(hoping to protect will)}
<D>__{nobody knew!}
<C>__{webster}
<P>__{(pointing at will)}
<D>__{he did! i saw him kissing her bubbies!}
<A>__{everybody looks at will, who stares at viola, helpless.}
<C>__{tilney}
<D>__{closed! closed, mark you, henslowe!}
<A>__{tilney turns on his heel and leaves in triumph. the company is still polaxed.}
<C>__{henslowe}
<P>__{(in despair)}
<D>__{it is over.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{i am so sorry, mr. henslowe. i wanted to be an actor.}
<P>__{(she turns to will)}
<D>__{i am sorry, will.}
<A>__{will shakes his head. this cannot be the end. viola walks away, leaving by the public entrance. they all let her go, watching her silently. as she passes wabash}
<C>__{wabash}
<D>__{y y y you w w w were w w w w wonderful.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{as she is leaving, will comes to life. he starts off towards her...but his progress is halted by a sock to the jaw from ned alleyn. will falls down in the dust. fennyman enters, still bent over his sheet of paper, mumbling his precious lines. when he reaches the groundlings yard, he finds to his surprise the whole company is standing about in attitudes of despair or worse. fennyman looks around.}
<C>__{fennyman}
<D>__{everything all right?}
