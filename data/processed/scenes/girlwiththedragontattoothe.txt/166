<A>__{blomkvist and martin drink skane. martin's normally breezy demeanor seems to have suffered from his mother's public displays. embarrassed by them and her, he's more serious now.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{my family is impossible. it's why the company is such a mess.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{please accept my apology for my mother's behavior.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{it's all right.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{it's not all right, she's unbearable. but it has nothing to do with you. it's between her and henrik ... she lost it when my father died. the drinking her state of mind it all got so bad henrik took me and my sister away from her, leaving her alone in our old house on the other side of the island like she was excommunicated. she's never forgiven him.}
<A>__{and he seems as lost now as he must have been then.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you have to stay and keep working. you're henrik's last chance at some kind of resolution. put this to rest for him one way of the other, and i will try to keep my mother away. but, please, do it as quickly as you can.}

<C>__{martin}
<D>__{how do you do.}
<C>__{salander}
