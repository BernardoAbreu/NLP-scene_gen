<A>__{clifford has just finished dialing the phone. he waits, nothing happens. then a strange, siren like noise comes out of the telephone. clifford listens, then hangs up. he picks up the .38 he has lying on the desk and idly starts flipping the cartridge chamber with one of his jimmy needles. after a moment, he lays the gun down and picks up the phone again, this time calling the operator.}
<C>__{operator }
<D>__{operator.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{can you dial a local number for me?}
<C>__{operator }
<D>__{what is the number, please?}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{555 2183.}
<A>__{the operator dials. there is a pause. then the same strange noise cuts in.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{operator, what does that mean?}
<C>__{operator }
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir, that line seems to be disconnected.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{why don't i get a recording?}
<C>__{operator }
<D>__{i don't know, sir. maybe the number was just recently disconnected. maybe there's a temporary malfunction in the wiring. why don't you try it again in the morning?}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{yeah, okay. thanks.}
