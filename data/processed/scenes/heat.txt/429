<B>__{hanna}
<A>__{runs across the grass between the fence to the strobe lights. closer: hanna among the structures housing the ballasts for the lights. the roar of a 757's 95,000 lbs. of thrust beats an him. he spins to protect his face. his clothes and hair are whipped. as he runs to us ... closer: hanna looks up.. hanna pov: up into lights searching for neil. suddenly: neil (slo mo) is there. his .45 is up, centered into hanna's face. he's eight feet away, framed against the glaring racks of strobes. neil's hand (slo mo) squeezing the trigger, both eyes over the front sight, moving laterally on target through the liquid air and lights... neil's .45 (slo mo) as the trigger's squeezed and the sear's released and... macro: the .45's hammer (slo mo) falling. hanna (slo mo) coming up with his 9mn. he's too late...}
<B>__{neil}
<A>__{the hammer drops. nothing. his .45 misfires. hanna (slo mo) his 9mm. coming up... neil's hand (slo mo) swipes across the .45's slide. macro: the breech of neil's .45 (slo mo) the misfired round, ejected and spinning away. the new round, moving forward, the slide returning to battery...}
<B>__{hanna}
<A>__{fires three perfectly controlled, hammered on shots. his front sight barely moved.}
<B>__{neil}
<A>__{hit three times in the chest is blown back into the racks of lights. he lies still.}
<B>__{hanna}
<A>__{approaches, slowly. his gun hand drops to his side. wide: neil + hanna neil's on the ground, his back against the rack. one arm is in his lap. the other is flung over the top bar of the strobe rack. neil looks at hanna and gestures with his hand. hanna takes it. neil holds on tight.}

<C>__{neil}
<D>__{...not half bad.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{...pretty good your own self.}
<A>__{then neil's eyes dim. and he dies. long rear shot: hanna + neil neil's head has fallen onto his shoulder. hanna still grips his hand and looks down the runway into the west at the lines of blue runway lights like rivers. the two of them stay there like that.}
