<D>__{the biggest waste of time since television.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{do you remember anything i've said that wasn't negative?}

<D>__{just the two of us.}
<A>__{it takes robin a few seconds to answer.}
<C>__{robin}

<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{robin whispers her answer. peter pulls away and settles down on his back. robin doesn't move for the longest time. finally, she eases onto her back and turns out the light.}
