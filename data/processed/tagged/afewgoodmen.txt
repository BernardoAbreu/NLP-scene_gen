<A>__{ross walks to the jury box.}
<C>__{ross}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the facts of the case are this: at midnight on august 6th, the defendants went into the barracks room of their platoon mate, pfc william santiago. they woke him up, tied his arms and legs with rope, and forced a rag into his throat. a few minutes later, a chemical reaction in santiago's body called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to begin bleeding. he drowned in his own blood and was pronounced dead at 32 minutes past midnight. these are the facts of the case. and they are undisputed. that's right. the story i just told you is the exact same story you're going to hear from corporal dawson, and it's the exact same story you're going to hear from private downey. furthermore, the government will also demonstrate that the defendants soaked the rag with poison, and entered santiago's room with motive and intent to kill.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now, lt. kaffee, is gonna try to pull off a little magic act, he's gonna try a little misdirection. he's going to astonish you with stories of rituals and dazzle you with official sounding terms like code red. he might even cut into a few officers for you. he'll have no evidence, mind you, none. but it's gonna be entertaining. when we get to the end, all the magic in the world will not have been able to divert your attention from the fact that willy santiago is dead, and dawson and downey killed him. these are the facts of the case.}

<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{there was no poison on the rag and there was no intent to kill and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile because it just ain't true.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when dawson and downey went into santiago's room that night, it wasn't because of vengeance or hatred, it wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't because they were looking for kicks on a friday night. it's because it was what they were ordered to do.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{let me say that again: it's because it was what they were ordered to do. now, out in the real world, that means nothing. and here at the washington navy yard, it doesn't mean a whole lot more. but if you're a marine assigned to rifle security company windward, guantanamo bay, cuba, and you're given an order, you follow it or you pack your bags.}

<D>__{i wanted the damn transfer order!}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{bullshit! you could've gotten it by picking up the phone and calling any one of a dozen departments at the pentagon. you didn't want the transfer order. you wanted to see jessep's reaction when you asked for the transfer order. you had an instinct. and it was confirmed by markinson. now damnit, let's put jessep on the stand and end this thing!}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{what possible good could come from putting jessep on the stand?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{he told kendrick to order the code red.}

<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{i told kendrick to tell his men that santiago wasn't to be touched.}
<C>__{kaffee}

<D>__{i ordered markinson to have santiago transferred off the base immediately.}

<D>__{why?}

<P>__{(to jessep)}
<D>__{upon hearing the news that he was finally getting his transfer, santiago was so excited, that do you know how many people he called? zero. nobody. not one call to his parents saying he was coming home. not one call to a friend saying can you pick me up at the airport. he was asleep in his bed at midnight, and according to you he was getting on a plane in six hours, yet everything he owned was hanging neatly in his closet and folded neatly in his footlocker. you were leaving for one day and you packed a bag and made three phone calls. santiago was leaving for the rest of his life, and he hadn't called a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. can you explain that? the fact is there was no transfer order. santiago wasn't going anywhere, isn't that right, colonel.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{object. your honor, it's obvious that lt. kaffee's intention this morning is to smear a high ranking marine officer in the desperate hope that the mere appearance of impropriety will win him points with the jury. it's my recommendation, sir, that lt. kaffee receive an official reprimand from the bench, and that the witness be excused with the court's deepest apologies.}

<D>__{no. it's not. it's tragic.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{do you have an answer?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{absolutely. my answer is i don't have the first damn clue. maybe he was an early morning riser and he liked to pack in the nq. and maybe he didn't have any friends. i'm an educated man, but i'm afraid i can't speak intelligently about the travel habits of william santiago. what i do know is that he was set to leave the base at 0600. now are these really the questions i was called here to answer? phone calls and footlockers? please tell me you've got something more, lieutenant. please tell me there's an ace up your sleeve. these two marines are on trial for their lives. please tell me their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill.}

<D>__{there wasn't a flight that left seven hours earlier and landed at andrews airforce base at 2 a.m.?}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{lieutenant, i think we've covered this, haven't we?}
<A>__{kaffee gets the two log books from his table as well as the piece of paper that sam scribbled on.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{your honor, these are the tower chief's logs for both guantanamo bay and andrews airforce base. the guantanamo log lists no flight that left at eleven p.m., and the andrews log lists no flight that landed at 2 a.m. i'd like to admit them as defense exhibits "a" and "b".}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{i don't understand. you're admitting evidence of a flight that never existed?}
<C>__{kaffee}

<D>__{colonel, i have just one more question before i call airman o'malley and airman perez: if you gave an order that santiago wasn't to be touched, and your orders are always followed, then why would he be in danger, why would it be necessary to transfer him off the base?}
<A>__{and jessep has no answer. nothing. he sits there, and for the first time, seems to be lost.}
