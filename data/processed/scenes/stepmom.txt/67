<L>__{interior jackie's kitchen night}
<A>__{jackie takes a kettle from the stove. pours the water into a tea cup. then, fills a second cup. drops a tea bag into each. carries both cups to... ...the kitchen table. where rachel is waiting. she looks more than tense. actually, scared. jackie taking this in, as she sets down the tea.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{okay, what is this? if you want to dump luke on me, no sale. you're stuck with him.}
<A>__{and before she can sit...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i know your secret.}
<A>__{jackie freezes. to stone. no one says anything. two hearts beating at red line.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i don't know wh...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i was looking for annabelle's book, and i found your tickets. and the note. from your new boss.}
<A>__{my what? jackie leans forward. her hands resting on the back of the chair she never sat in.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{my boss.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you're not working at random house, i talked to them.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you what?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you're taking the kids. and moving to san francisco.}
<A>__{and jackie has to laugh. cold. bitter.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{look, you've never liked me...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{don't flatter yourself.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and i know checking into your life was inexcusable...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{nobody likes a snoop.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{but i came here to...}
<A>__{all the air comes out of this young woman. so vulnerable, so real.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{...to beg you. not to do it.}
<A>__{and at this. a look of intense interest crosses jackie's face. really?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'd have thought this was the answer to your prayers. lose the witch, and her two brats, in one swoop. problems solved.}
<A>__{rachel is clearly distraught. this is no act.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you can't take luke's children away from him.}
<A>__{jackie thinking. reading this girl's face.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{bi coastal parenting. happens every day. luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(blurts)}
<D>__{we can't live like that.}
<A>__{and jackie straightens. cocks her head.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{did i hear the word...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{luke. can't live like that.}
<A>__{ah.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{then let him talks to me. we don't need you to solve our prob...}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{...it's my problem, too.}
<A>__{and rachel's eyes. fill with tears. she hates that. jackie won't take her off the hook. stands waiting, until...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i got used to...thinking of them. as...my kids too.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{really. by what right? six months of part time screw ups?}
<A>__{rachel lifts her chin. defiant and tender at once.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{no right at all. i just love them.}
<A>__{now it's jackie's eyes. that begin to fill. and she hates that even more.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{there's so many publishing houses in new york. surely, you could find a good one?}
<A>__{jackie takes a step back. shakes her head. goddammit, life is full of surprises. she walks around in a little circle. turns back...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{sure, i could. if i was looking for one.}
<A>__{rachel's turn to be surprised. confused.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you're a moron, kid. you guessed the wrong secret.}
<A>__{an odd, almost defiant look. jackie reaches up to her own head, and... ...slowly, holding eye contact all the way, she slips the wig from her head. her scalp covered by the partial regrowth that chemo therapy has left her. you can hear rachel's gasp clear to kansas.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{charlie drummond used to be a colleague at random house. i'm crashing at her place, while i take some new protein injections my oncologist recommended. i can only get them in san francisco.}
<A>__{rachel's lips part. but no sound comes.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{life's a trade off. you get cancer, your hair falls out, but you do get to smoke dope.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(please)}
<D>__{you're not dying.}
<A>__{the kid so painfully sincere.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{no such luck. i'm beating the shit out of this. pardon my french.}
<A>__{rachel can't find her breath. she is clearly the worse off of the two, in this moment. then she starts to nod...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you bet you are.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{how the hell would you know?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i don't, but...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{how would you know anything ?}
<A>__{that was sharp. rachel startles slightly.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i exercise, i eat the healthiest foods, you live on pork rinds and ho ho's, and i've got cancer!}
<A>__{that leaves a silence.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and cigarettes. i smoke, too.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you are marrying the greatest guy who walks this earth . who i have loved from my heart for twelve years !}
<A>__{listening?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{and you walk in. you smile that smile. you move that boy. and he's yours for free.}
<A>__{she sags back against the counter.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{and you. love my kids. how fucking touching.}
<A>__{comes forward. stalks her.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{they came out of my body !}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{see, i know that.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i have given them more love and more care every fifteen minutes of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty years !}
<A>__{leans over the table. rachel looks scared to death.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{okay, i'm undeserving.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ironic, huh?}
<A>__{and staring in rachel's eyes, jackie's fierceness fades.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ironic, that i'm gonna need you.}
<A>__{all the air comes out. her heart as naked as her skull.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{to be a little less. undeserving.}
<A>__{the look holds. and holds.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{drink your tea while i go vomit.}
<A>__{and turns, goes to the door. turns back.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you love my kids, that's a start.}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{we'll work on it.}
<A>__{and gone. hear her footsteps. climbing stairs. rachel lifts her cup. looks at it.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{this is very good tea!}
<A>__{then tastes it. makes a face.}
