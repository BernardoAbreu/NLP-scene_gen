<L>__{interior notary public, records room day}
<A>__{ichabod sticks his head in, not liking what he sees. hardenbrook's amidst unbelievable disarray. tables, shelves, and baskets of unevenly piled documents. hardenbrook looks on a shelf, confused, then goes to a table, lifting papers, mumbling.}
<C>__{hardenbrook}
<D>__{damn... damn... damn...}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{master hardenbrook...}
<A>__{hardenbrook turns, a bit startled.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{perhaps, i could assist in finding them?}
<C>__{hardenbrook}
<D>__{well... that might be... helpful.}
<L>__{interior notary public, records room (time cut) day}
<A>__{hardenbrook is asleep in a chair, snoring, blind eye open. ichabod and young masbath face official looking documents, with ichabod focused on one will in hand.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{my father had farm land. it was the only thing we owned of any value.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<P>__{(still reading)}
<D>__{and it now belongs to you, according to baltus. i heard him say it.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{ichabod turns the will in his hand to masbath.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{then look here at your father's will, and tell me why you are not listed.}
<A>__{young masbath takes it, boggled. ichabod grabs another.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{van garrett had denoted his elder son in his last wishes; the same son murdered along with him. but van garrett's wife and two infant children are not written... and they were spared.}
<P>__{(picks up another will)}
<D>__{do you see? philipse had no family to bestow his farm to. but, here...}
<P>__{(picks up another)}
<D>__{the widow windsor was listed on her late husband's will. after her inheritance, she amended the document to include her bastard child. this is why the horseman made absolutely certain to impale the unborn descendant.}
<A>__{ichabod sits back.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{only the heirs were killed. proof that the horseman slaughters by assignment.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{but, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{no one yet, far as i can tell. it has gone intestate.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{in test... what?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{intestate. your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{what does it mean?}
<A>__{ichabod stares off.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. and, who in this town is owed a great many debts?}
<C>__{young masbath}
<P>__{(realization)}
<D>__{baltus van tassel.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{did your father take a loan?}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{yes. i rode with him on payment days.}
<A>__{ichabod stands, grim, gathering wills and his ledger.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{tonight, we answer questions. and, to discover who moves about the van tassel house after dark... all we need is a candle.}
<A>__{a loud noise is heard from the other room. ichabod looks.}
