<B>__{parking lot}
<A>__{we are high and wide on the office building's parking lot. jerry emerges wrapped in a parka, his arms sticking stiffly out at his sides, his breath vaporizing. he goes to his car, opens its front door, pulls out a red plastic scraper and starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice that has developed on his windshield. the scrape scrape scrape sound carries in the frigid air. jerry goes into a frenzy, banging the scraper against the windshield and the hood of his car. the tantrum passes. jerry stands pantin, staring at nothing in particular. scrape scrape scrape he goes back to work on the windshield.}
<B>__{front door}
<A>__{a beat, silent but for a key scraping at the lock. the door swings open and jerry edges in, looking about, holding a sack of groceries.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{hon?}
<A>__{he shuts the door.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{... got the growshries...}
<A>__{he has already seen the shower curtain on the floor. he frowns, pokes at it with his foot.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{... hon?}
<B>__{upstairs bathroom}
<A>__{jerry walks in. he sets the groceries down on the toilet tank. he looks at the open window, through which snow still sifts in. he shuts it. he picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink, frowns at it, puts it back in the medicine chest. he looks at the shower curtain rod holding empty rings.}
<B>__{foyer}
<A>__{once again we are looking at the rumpled shower curtain. from another room:}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{yah, wade, i it's jerry, i.}
<A>__{then, slightly more agitated.}
<C>__{jerry}

<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{... wade, it's jerry, i we gotta talk, wade, it's terrible...}
<A>__{beat.}
<B>__{living room}
<A>__{jerry stands in wide shot, hands on hips, looking down at a telephone. after a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in a number.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{... yah, wade gustafson, please.}
<B>__{black}
<A>__{hold in black. a slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large paper mache figure into frame. it is a flannel shirt woodsman carrying a double edged ax over one shoulder. as we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a pedestal. a sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal: welcome to brainderd home of paul bunyan. the headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the background. the two lane highway is otherwise empty.}
