<L>__{interior prison locker room, night}
<A>__{kable is alone, toweling off privilege of being a top}
<B>__{slayer.}
<A>__{we see now the damage his body has taken he is covered in dark, ugly bruises from bullet hits the body armor has absorbed including a flinch inducing cluster of black, blue and yellow from the most recent session. from down the row of lockers, a whisper:}
<C>__{hackman}
<D>__{hey. kable.}
<A>__{kable turns to look. hackman's head is poked out sideways from around the corner; he's maybe 20 feet away.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{not interested.}
<C>__{hackman}
<D>__{no. wait. look.}
<A>__{he brings his hands out where kable can see them they are}
<B>__{slick with fresh blood.}
<D>__{hackman (cont'd) (cont'd) i just deleted someone.}
<A>__{hackman is almost giggling, high on it.}
<D>__{hackman (cont'd) (cont'd) this is the blood. look.}
<A>__{hackman rubs his slippery hands together, relishing it; he nods his head toward the area behind the lockers... to call the situation creepy would be a serious understatement.}
<C>__{hackman }
<D>__{he's back here. want to see?}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{your head ain't on straight.}
<A>__{hackman cracks his neck. maybe not. kable pulls on his prison greys quickly, refusing to make eye contact.}
<C>__{hackman}
<D>__{i'm going to delete you too. on sunday.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{yeah, probably.}
<C>__{hackman}
<D>__{that's why they put me here.}
<A>__{kable's eyes narrow what? hackman disappears; he starts to move along an adjacent row of lockers, slamming the doors singing fucking pinocchio:}
<C>__{hackman }
<D>__{i've got no strings... so i have fun... i'm not tied up to anyone... they've got strings but you can see there are no strings on me...}
<A>__{kable tenses up, ready for instant violence.}
<C>__{hackman }
<D>__{you got two whores, kable...}
<A>__{if he didn't have kable's attention before, this got it.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{ the fuck did you say?}
<C>__{hackman}
<D>__{on the outside... oh, i'm sorry i meant your pretty girls... you want to get back to them but i'm going to visit them first...}
<A>__{kable is instantly all business he's going to make hackman disappear right the fuck now... he jams around the corner but hackman is nowhere to be seen... past another row of lockers nothing... another... another... where the hell is he?}
<B>__{nowhere.}
<A>__{kable slams a fist into a locker, busting it off it's hinges.}
