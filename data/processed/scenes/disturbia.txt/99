<L>__{interior kale's bedroom night later}
<A>__{kale enters amidst a few more lightning flashes and distant rolls of thunder. he heads to his window, glances out at giles' house. dark. the wind's picking up. kale closes his window, draws the shade, sticks his cell in the charger. he collapses to the bed, stares at the roof over his head for a beat then "like a virgin" suddenly blares on his cell phone. kale stares at it... then jumps from his bed, races to the phone, rips it from the charger, flips it open on the phone's lcd screen a text message: look at your screen. the lcd screen suddenly blacks out. the battery's dead. a wide eyed kale puts the cell phone on his desk, slowly shifts his gaze to his computer monitor a grainy image suddenly pops on shaky at first then it finally steadies, and clears up. a torso and face come into focus: ronnie, lying in the corner of a very enclosed space. eyes open, head tilted against the wall. dead.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{oh my god }
<A>__{nearly hyperventilating, kale leans closer to the screen, sees a pile of clothes and a stray racketball trophy lying next to ronnie.}
<C>__{kale }
<D>__{shit }
<A>__{kale realizes ronnie's in his closet. kale slowly turns, eyes his closet door. he then steps toward it, reaches out and slides the closet door open to reveal ronnie lying dead in the corner.}
<C>__{kale }
<D>__{ronnie }
<A>__{kale kneels down to ronnie who suddenly pops back to life!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{boo!}
<A>__{kale screams, falls back to the floor as ronnie cracks up. more lightning flashes and thunder. kale staggers to his feet. stunned. not knowing whether to hug ronnie or beat the shit out of him.}
<C>__{ronnie }
<D>__{dude, don't kill me, don't kill me i can explain }
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{how how long have you been here?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you should have seen your face }
<P>__{(off kale's glare)}
<D>__{i got out his front door. i got lucky. i heard you yelling, but dude, cops were everywhere }
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{still, you could have }
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what, popped out and said, "oh yeah, officers, my friend's right, i was just in that house, i'd gone to get my cell phone out of the guy's car i broke into earlier..." are you kidding me?}
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(beat; then)}
<D>__{i get it.}
<A>__{kale paces around, runs a hand through his hair as ronnie steps out of the closet, dv cam in hand.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{dude, i am sorry. can we just... hug it out?}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{why didn't giles tell the cops someone broke in? i mean, he did see you, right?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you know, let's be positive for a change. i thought he did, but maybe he didn't. or maybe he's a nice guy afterall, and he didn't wanna make a big deal of it, you know? i mean, he's a guy, he was a kid once...}
<A>__{kale eyes ronnie.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{what if he wasn't always a guy?}
<A>__{ronnie eyes kale for a beat, wondering if he's serious. then kale cracks a smile. ronnie cracks up.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{but i do have to ask... what was in the bag?}
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(as if it were obvious)}
<D>__{dead deer.}
<A>__{kale and ronnie lock eyes a beat. then crack up again. both laugh hysterically, slap happy as hell.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{naturally...}
<P>__{(re: dv cam)}
<D>__{hey, you want more evidence, detective?}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{i was watching, remember?}
<A>__{kale grabs the dv cam from ronnie ronnie pulls it away.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no, no, this is comedy, it deserves big screen treatment.}
<A>__{ronnie grabs some wires, starts hooking the camera up to kale's tv.}
