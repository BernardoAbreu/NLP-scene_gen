<D>__{i was sitting in my house on prom night wearing that goddamned rented tuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a bottle of champagne in the other. so i was just sitting there, and then the whole night flashed before my eyes, and it struck me like a bullet in the head i realized, finally, and for the first time, that... i wanted to kill somebody. so i figured because i loved you so much, that'd it'd be a good idea if i didn't see you anymore. but now i'm different.}
<A>__{he turns and points the gun at the front door and fires two shots through it, leaving two baseball size holes in the door. martin bolts out of the room toward the back of the house. debi and newberry run as fast as they can away from martin. newberry opens the front door, preparing to rush out with debi. they stop at what they see: newberry's & debi's p.o.v. as assassin lies on the porch, shot dead through the door by martin. in one hand is a gun, in the other is a fuller brush kit. two men, grocer and an assassin, clamber out of van, their guns rising up fast toward us. debi pulls newberry inside, slams the front door, and locks it. they dive away just before ten rounds hit the door from outside.}
