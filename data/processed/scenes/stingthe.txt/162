<A>__{dark and somewhat foreboding, its peeling dragons and shoddy lanterns compete for space with the many slot machines and arcade games that line the walls. hooker, lonnegan and twist sit at one of the more secluded tables. they are not eating.}

<D>__{can't do it. there're telegraph inspectors all over the place. i got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and i'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees. we'll get somebody else to do our betting.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{i could come up with 750 grand in a day if i had a reason to.}
<C>__{twist}
<D>__{but who says you will. i got a guy i can depend on. he's liquidating everything he has for this. you wouldn't even give carver his money back.}

<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{and what do we know about your guy. he says a week, but who knows if it's a month? lonnegan here's a banker. he can get that dough with no questions asked.}
<A>__{twist says nothing for a minute, then:}
<C>__{twist}
<D>__{all right. be at the booth at 1:00. i will give you all three places this time, lonnegan. that better be proof enough.}
<A>__{hooker and lonnegan smile at each other like life long friends. they get up to leave, and we frame the shot with a coffee cup large in the foreground. as they go out the door, a black gloved hand with four fingers enters the frame and puts a nickel down next to the cup.}
