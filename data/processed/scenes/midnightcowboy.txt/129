<A>__{... ratso staring out at joe, paralyzed in the act of lighting a cigarette intercut in flashing close ups joe outside the window, ratso inside reflecting their conflicting emotions joe's murderous rage ratso's panic one almost subliminal flash of each revealing something like pleasure at finding a long lost friend...}

<A>__{... ratso staring up into camera, holding his breath.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{don't hit me, i'm a cripple.}
<A>__{joe's hand falls on ratso's shoulder.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh, i ain't gonna hit you, i'm gonna strangle you to death...}
<A>__{the cigarette in ratso's mouth burns into his lip. he jerks spasmodically, choking on smoke as he rips skin away with the butt and drops it in his coffee cup.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{... only first i'm gonna turn you upside down and shake you out right here and now.}
<A>__{coughing, eyes tearing, ratso empties his pockets on the counter, finally producing: sixty four cents, a few sticks of gum, an almost empty cigarette package, a book of matches and two pawn tickets. he raises his eyes, somehow ashamed. joe kicks the toe of ratso's loafer.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what's in your socks?}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{not a cent, i swear to god, i swear on my mother's eyes.}
<A>__{ratso removes his loafers and shakes them, glancing at the counter man. his socks don't even conceal his toes. disgusted, joe shoves ratso's small pile back at him.}
<C>__{ratso }
<D>__{you keep the sixty four cents. i want you to have it.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it's sticky. what you do, slobber on 'em? i wouldn't touch 'em.}
<A>__{joe should leave ratso obviously has nothing tangible to offer but joe hesitates, lighting a cigarette as ratso pulls on his loafers.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{how do you like that o'daniel, flipping out like that? i wanted to get in touch with you when i heard, but i been laid up with this cold...}
<A>__{ratso touches his chest, forcing a cough which continues itself beyond his intention.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{okay, right, right, okay. another subject. where you living? still at the hotel?}
