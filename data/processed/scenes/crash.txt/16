<L>__{interior james's car night}
<A>__{numbly watching james as she fumbles to undo her seat belt, the woman in the other crashed car inadvertently jerks open her blouse and exposes her breast to james, its inner curve marked by a dark, strap like bruise made by her seat belt. in the strange, desperate privacy of this moment, the breast's erect nipple seems somehow, impossibly, a deliberate provocation.}
<L>__{interior hospital day}
<A>__{we are close on a face having makeup applied to it. it is a very pale, blotchy face, and the makeup is smoothing it, making it appear healthy and even slightly tanned. there are also some crude black stitches in this face, and we realize that it is james's face, and that a very serious catherine is applying the makeup. james's legs are up in a sling, drainage tubes coming from both knees. wounds on his chest: broken skin around the lower edge of the sternum, where the horn boss had been driven upwards by the collapsing engine compartment; a semicircular bruise, a marbled rainbow, running from one nipple to the other. stitches in the laceration across the scalp, a second hairline an inch below the original. unshaven face and fretting hands. catherine is dressed more for a smart lunch with an airline executive than to visit her husband in hospital.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{there, that's better.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{james examines himself in her hand mirror, staring at his pale, mannequin like face, trying to read its lines. catherine looks around her as she puts her makeup away. there are twenty three other beds in the briskly efficient looking new ward, all of them empty.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{not a lot of action here.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{they consider this to be the airport hospital. this ward is reserved for air crash victims. the beds are kept waiting.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{if i groundloop during my flying lesson on saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i will listen for you buzzing over.}
<A>__{catherine crosses her legs and tries to light a cigarette with a heavy, mechanically complex lighter with which she is obviously unfamiliar.}
<C>__{james}
<P>__{(referring to the lighter)}
<D>__{is that a gift from wendel? it has an aeronautical feel to it.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{yes. from wendel. to celebrate the licence approval for our air charter firm. i forgot to tell you.}
<A>__{catherine finally succeeds in lighting the cigarette. she takes a deep drag. james props himself up on his elbow, breathing with transparent pain.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{that's going well, then.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{well, yes.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you're getting out of bed tomorrow. they want you to walk.}
<A>__{james gestures for the cigarette. catherine puts the warm tip, stained with pink lipstick, into his mouth.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{the other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor dr helen remington. she's here, somewhere. as a patient, of course. maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{and her husband? what was he?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{he was a chemical engineer with a food company.}
<A>__{a dark haired student female nurse comes into the ward. she wags a finger at james.}
<C>__{student nurse}
<D>__{no smoking, please.}
<A>__{as catherine retrieves the cigarette from james and stubs it out in a glass, the nurse examines catherine's glamorous figure, her expensive suit, her jewelry.}
<C>__{student nurse}
<P>__{(to catherine)}
<D>__{are you this gentleman's wife? mrs ballard?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{student nurse}
<D>__{you can stay for this, then.}
<A>__{the nurse pulls the bedclothes back and digs the urine bottle from between james's legs. she checks the level and, satisfied, drops it back, flips over the sheets again. both catherine and james watch her closely, her sly thighs under her gingham, the movement of her breasts as she bends to check the chart at the foot of the bed, the pulse in her throat. the nurse catches them watching her, smiles enigmatically back at them, and leaves. catherine pulls out a manila folder from her bag and slips a set of storyboards for a commercial out of it.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{aida telephoned to say how sorry she was, but could you look at the storyboards again, she's made a number of changes.}
<A>__{james waves the folder away. catherine examines his body, aloofly curious.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{where's the car?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{outside in the visitors' car park.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{what!? they brought the car here?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{my car, not yours. yours is a complete wreck. the police dragged it to the pound behind the station.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{have you seen it?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{the sergeant asked me to identify it. he didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{it's about time.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{it is?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{after being bombarded endlessly by road safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in an actual accident.}
