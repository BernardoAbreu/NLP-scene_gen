<L>__{interior habitat hallway}
<A>__{down a long corridor we see barnes, through a half closed door, pacing, talking on the phone...}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{... it's definitely something alien ... another civilization, yes, sir... well, we don't know yet, but we think we've found a door...}
<L>__{interior video feed room}
<A>__{edmunds, barnes, and the team members (minus ted) look at the monitor.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{so how do we get it open?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ted seems to have some ideas.}
<A>__{on the monitor ted pushing on the sphere door. banging into it with his shoulder.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{maybe we shouldn't.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{if it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(nodding to norman)}
<D>__{man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows. the anthropomorphic problem. good, norman.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i mentioned it in my report. didn't you read the report?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{everything ever written about extra terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human. if it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{so? what's the problem?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's nonsense. there's enough difference between our own species to prove that.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{cannibalism, to be extreme. and now we're talking about a new life form. their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{like "thou shall not kill"?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{or maybe, it can't e illed.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{you mean, what's in that thing is immortal?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i don't know. that's the pointerior}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{everything can be killed.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{not everything. even on earth. take ... yeasts.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{yeasts? thank you, beth, but i don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and we're just talking about three dimensional creatures. what if it's five or six or seven dimensional? so dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{good pointerior i don't know what you're talking about, but good pointerior}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it could. but the odds of it being any use to us are against it.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{you don't know that.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval europe. suppose you went back to medieval europe with a tv set. there wouldn't be any place to plug it in.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{just tell me worst case. worst case of what we might find?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{produce radioactive waste and disintegrate us into nothing.}
