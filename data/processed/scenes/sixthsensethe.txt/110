<L>__{interior antique store day}
<A>__{we are in an antique store. filled floor to ceiling with furniture and knickknacks. anna stands with a young couple. all three lean over and peer into a glass cabinet. an antique engagement ring sits on a velvet stand.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's edwardian. beautifully worked. entirely platinum with a mine cut diamond and an actual color burmese sapphire... it's timeless.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{you got anything a little plainer?}
<A>__{the young woman looks at her beau.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{plainer? you want a plain ring to go with your plain fiance. is that how it is?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{no, baby. don't get in a tizzy. it's just... you're so beautiful... you're like a burmese sapphire all by yourself. you don't need all that.}
<C>__{young woman}
<P>__{(disbelief)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{anna smiles as she takes the ring out of the cabinet.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{why don't you two hold it?}
<A>__{she places it in their hands.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{do you feel longing?}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{when i touch this piece i feel a longing. i imagine the woman who owned this, loved a man deeply she couldn't be with.}
<A>__{the young woman looks at anna with great intrigue.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{did he have wavy hair and broad shoulders?}
<A>__{the young man throws an odd glance at his fiance.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't know... but maybe...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a lot of the pieces in this store give me feelings. i think maybe when people own things and then they pass away a part of themselves gets printed on those things like fingerprints.}
<A>__{beat. the young man and the young woman gaze at anna silently. they look down at the ring. they place their hands on it reverently, delicately like checking for a pulse. anna can't hold back her sweet smile.}
