<A>__{emerging from the blackness... the same strong male hands that unearthed the rock now pulls his rain soaked jacket clear of his torso. a crude bandage wrapped around one of the fingers. the rock is slipped up under his jacket... up against his bare chest. the jacket is pulled down to conceal the rock and the faceless figure drifts away.}

<C>__{brian}
<D>__{this is it. this is the where he'd take her whenever he had the urge to molest her.}
<A>__{the flashlight finds the corner in question. flash!! the warehouse lights up again, revealing a huge machine room.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{of course! nobody would have heard her cries over the noise of the machines.}
