<L>__{exterior montana avenue day}
<A>__{pete and debbie get out of the car and walk down the street.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{it's your birthday, you don't need to go to the store.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i know, just five minutes. i think desi and jodi are fighting.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{all right, five minutes. but then i'm pulling you out.}
<L>__{interior debbie's store day}
<A>__{pete and debbie enter and we see their two employees, jodi and a new, gorgeous employee, desi, who is up on a ladder.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{hi. how's jodi treating you?}
<C>__{desi}
<D>__{jodi? oh, jodi's my new bff. she's like a little kitty cat. sometimes she comes and rubs up against my leg.}
<C>__{jodi}
<D>__{you're a ball of shit.}
<C>__{desi}
<D>__{she loves me.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{huh.}
<A>__{debbie goes behind the register. she looks at jodi.}
<C>__{debbie }
<D>__{can you do inventory so that we can do the sidewalk sale? and you really need to pay attention to the numbers because we have twelve thousand dollars unaccounted for.}
<C>__{jodi}
<D>__{i think it's probably desi. she's been having a really hard time using these simple computers.}
<C>__{jodi }
<D>__{it's because she's stupid. i think she might be stealing.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{she's not stealing. she's our best employee. she made nine grand last month.}
<C>__{jodi}
<D>__{well, how much did i make?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you brought in twenty two hundred.}
<C>__{jodi}
<D>__{that's not bad.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{well, that's not that good. i mean, i'm not comparing you, but you're not as good.}
<A>__{pete is still staring at desi on the ladder.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(to desi)}
<D>__{all right. see you.}
<A>__{pete walks over to debbie.}
<C>__{pete }
<D>__{i don't think she's wearing underwear.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{it's all dark up there.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{what? why are you looking?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i didn't mean to look, i just said, `hey woah!' there it was.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{maybe she's wearing dark underwear.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yeah. maybe she has underwear that has a picture of a vagina painted on it.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{stop looking.}
<A>__{desi comes down to help a customer at the front of the store.}
<C>__{desi}
<D>__{maybe some deep oranges and browns and maybe dark greens? that would really play up your features.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{i will just take out my amex and you pick what stuff you think is good.}
