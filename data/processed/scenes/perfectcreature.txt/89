<L>__{ext: jamestown slum, alleyway continuing}
<A>__{lilly's pov down the alleyway. it seems empty. the pov moves in a little and there in an offshoot of the alleyway we can see freddy. he is standing over a woman who cowers; she's plainly a prostitute. freddy points a gun at her head.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{you've been ripping me off! i should blow your dirty little brains out!}
<C>__{steph}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{police! put the gun down now!}
<A>__{and now we see, it's not lilly we've been watching, but steph. she points her gun at freddy. freddy turns to steph. he slowly raises his arms.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{it's ok. i'm complying officer, see.}
<C>__{steph}
<D>__{put the gun on the ground and step away!}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{i'm doing it.}
<A>__{freddy puts the gun down. the prostitute on the ground now scrambles to her feet and heads towards steph.}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{he's crazy! fucking crazy!}
<A>__{she gives freddy the finger then heads off.}
<C>__{steph}
<P>__{(to the prostitute)}
<D>__{wait!}
<P>__{(to freddy)}
<D>__{down! right now, down on the ground!}
<A>__{freddy gets down.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{i'm getting wet now.}
<A>__{low angle on steph approaching. behind her a figure is descending the wall behind him.}
<C>__{steph}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{steph is over freddy now. he's staring up at her. he can see that a shape has appeared behind steph. edgar, his eyes gleaming. steph pulls out some handcuffs.}
<C>__{steph}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{put your hands behind your back.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{sure. anything you say.}
<A>__{but before steph can move forward, edgar has her gun hand in a vice like grip. she cries out in pain as her wrist disintegrates. as a reflex she stamps on edgar's foot and kicks him in the groin with her other. he does not flinch. he smashes steph into a down pipe on the wall of the alley so that wet grit is ground into her face. we then see edgar's face at her shoulder.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{nice to meet you again.}
<A>__{edgar pulls back the jacket at steph's neck to find no scars. he pulls steph's face towards him brutally, staring at her profile. he then smashes her head against the pipe so that she falls unconscious to the ground.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{you brought me the wrong one.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{does it matter, one's as good as the next?}
<A>__{edgar's stare makes freddy shut up and avert his eyes. edgar then turns on the tube on his arm so that blood drips into the unconscious steph's mouth; making her gag.}
<C>__{freddy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you promised me some of that.}
<A>__{freddy's licking his lips. edgar studies freddy, then raises his arm. freddy just stares. we see the tube on edgar's arm that connects to his veins. and in a moment freddy has latched onto it and is sucking like some kind of human leech.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{what do you see freddy. visions? can you see your future?}
<A>__{for a moment edgar strokes freddy's hair, then rips the tube away.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{freddy moves forward, but is pushed back by edgar.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{don't be a greedy little pig freddy. you have to earn more.}
<A>__{close on edgar, his repellent features under the hood. he looks up. far above, through the falling rain, past the high rise slum around them; we see the moon hanging like a pearly crescent in the sky. the moon is slowly obscured by clouds.}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{we have more to do.}
<A>__{cut to}
