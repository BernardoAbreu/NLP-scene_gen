<L>__{exterior mount holliston day}
<A>__{peace. fresh snow glistens in the sunlight and reflects off of the giant pine trees covering the serene mountain side. it's quiet. so quiet.}

<T>__{hard cut to:}
<L>__{exterior the chair lift day}
<A>__{tight on a gloved hand as a lever is released. tight on the cables at the top of a rickety chair lift as they kick into motion. wider as an empty chair swivels around and beneath the asses of a threesome of skiers. even wider to reveal a long line of skiers and snowboarders awaiting their moment to step up to the chair. the camera finds a group of three standing off to the side of the line, decked out in their winter gear.}
<L>__{exterior snow bank overlooking the chair lift continuous}
<A>__{angle on dan walker (college age, shaggy hair, holding a snowboard and a helmet in one hand) as he studies the situation. next to him stands an impatient joe lynch (college age, goggles on his head and a face full of fresh stubble, standing on skis).}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i don't see her.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{the shift change is late. just wait.}
<A>__{parker o'neil (college age, red hair, holding a snowboard) sighs and stares back at the lift lane.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{are you sure about this?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we've been doing this forever. trust me. this lady loves lynch. she always goes for it.}
<A>__{lynch smiles at parker.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i'm cute.}
<A>__{just then, jason (a ski mountain employee) approaches the front of the line and excuses the employee working the chair.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{is um... is that her?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{dude.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{it's cool, it's cool.}
<P>__{(to parker)}
<D>__{look, all you have to do is smile real pretty and tell him }
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{ what? me? no way. this is your thing.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{parker, listen, listen. it's so easy. all you do is tell the guy that you and your friends }
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{ girlfriends. say "girlfriends".}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{ you and your girlfriends forgot your credit card and you can't pick up your lift tickets.}
<A>__{he grabs a wad of cash out of lynch's glove and shoves it in parker's hand.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{start at $50. that's what we usually give the other lady. he'll take it. trust me.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{dan, no. you do it. i feel stupid.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{you've got this. you can totally do this.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{parker, you've so got this.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{the worst thing that happens is he says no. he won't say no. no one ever says no.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{why me?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{`cause you're a girl.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{a very beautiful girl with a very charming smile.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{just...}
<A>__{he unzips her jacket a little bit, showing some more of her body.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{there.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{my charming smile?}
<A>__{dan and lynch smile back at her. she exits reluctantly towards the lift line.}
<L>__{exterior chair lift line continuous}
<A>__{parker pushes her snowboard forward and moves up the side of the line, passing all of the skiers who are waiting. she approaches jason who is now running the lift. he lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{jason looks up at her.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{could i bum a smoke?}
<A>__{she flashes an adorable but forced smile and he quickly obliges with a cigarette.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he lights her cigarette.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{i'm parker.}
<A>__{he looks around, not all that sure why a cute girl is talking to him for more than just to get a smoke.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{jason.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{oh, cool. my brother's name is jason.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{yeah, so i don't want to waste your time and bullshit you cause you seem like a wicked busy guy and everything...but..this is gonna sound so stupid...}
<A>__{jason is all ears.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{my girlfriends and i drove all the way up here from salem state, and i was sort of the dumbass who told everyone that i could cover the lift tickets on my mom's credit card...but then i left her credit card at the gas station...and so...}
<A>__{jason totally sees where this is going.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{no but i mean, we totally have some cash and stuff. we just don't have enough to cover all 3 lift tickets, you know?}
<A>__{jason exhales two lungs full of smoke as the next group gets onto the lift.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{like...fifty?}
<A>__{jason scoffs and starts the lift.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{i could lose my job.}
<A>__{he looks around.}
<L>__{exterior snow bank overlooking the chair lift continuous}
<A>__{lynch and dan watch parker at work.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{he's not going for it.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{will you shut up? he's gonna go for it. it's either stand there and do the job for minimal... minimal, what is it?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{minimum.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{ minimum wage or do it for minimum wage plus a little bit more.}
<A>__{lynch sighs, then changes the subject.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{she had to come skiing with us?}
<A>__{dan looks back at him, offended.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{you said you didn't mind?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i don't. i don't mind. don't mind at all.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{i'm just saying, you haven't done dollar pitchers at fezziwigs with us since last semester. you never come around for monday night football, nobody has seen you at }
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{ i watched the game with you last week!}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{for ten minutes, dan. football games are more than ten minutes. they're lots of ten minutes es, you know?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{dude, i have a girlfriend now. i love this girl. i don't know what you...}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{no, no it's fine. i'm just saying, the mount holliston day trips were our thing, you know? she doesn't even know how to board yet.}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{she's getting better.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{now i feel like a dick. you should have said something if it was a problem.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{it's not a problem. it's not. forget i ever said anything.}
<A>__{they see parker hand jason something. he pockets it and she glides her way back to the end of the line. she looks up at the guys waiting on the hill and then excitedly waves. proud of herself. dan smiles at lynch.}
<L>__{exterior chair lift line continuous}
<A>__{lynch and dan join parker and slowly work their way up the line.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{good work! see? they always go for it.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i did good, right?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{you did great.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{oh, so where's my change?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{there isn't any.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{you gave him the full hundred?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{he wasn't going for it at 50.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{so what happened to the other fifty numbers in between there? like, i don't know, $51 or maybe even $75?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you gave me two 50's. what was i supposed to do, ask for change?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i would have asked for change.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{it's still way cheaper than paying for tickets, right?}
<A>__{dan is disappointed.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i would have definitely asked him for change.}
<A>__{they get up to the front of the line. jason looks at dan and lynch behind parker.}
<C>__{jason}
<P>__{(scoffs at parker)}
<D>__{"girlfriends"?}
<A>__{parker gives him an apologetic smile. the three get in front of the chair. it descends under them and scoops them off of the ground into the air.}
<L>__{exterior chair lift moments later}
<A>__{the threesome float high above the mountain as the chair slowly makes it's way to the top.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{look at that. see? all these other idiots are paying top dollar to ski. not us. all thanks to you, baby.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{oh, now i'm "baby"? you never call me pet names.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i'm just not a `pet name' guy.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(to lynch)}
<D>__{he calls me "parker."}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{it's your name.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{yeah but you're supposed to call me something affectionate, you know? like "honey" or "sweetie".}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed. it was so weird. "oh, lynch! your hair is so soft! do me harder, lynch!" it was like i was throwing it to dan over here.}
<A>__{dan looks back to parker.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{see? at least i don't call you "o'neil".}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you don't touch my face enough either.}
<A>__{dan laughs.}
<C>__{lynch}
<P>__{(to no one imparticular)}
<D>__{third wheel.}
<A>__{parker reaches across and playfully taps lynch.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{watch it, lynch.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{hey, that's not fair. i'm not dating you, you don't get to make my life suck.}
<A>__{parker shoots dan a look: "oh, really?"}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{wha ? i never said that. i never said you make my life suck.}
<P>__{(then, forced)}
<D>__{sweetie.}
<A>__{after a beat he awkwardly reaches out and touches her face. nothing sweet or sensitive about it, but he's trying.}
<C>__{parker}
<B>__{e}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{aww!}
<C>__{lynch}
<P>__{(to parker)}
<D>__{dan tells me you're getting the hang of that board?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i wouldn't say that. but last time we went i did pretty good, right?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{you did awesome. i'm telling you, the first few times are frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it's like riding a bike.}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(to lynch's skis)}
<D>__{are you gonna trade in those ancient things for a board?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{please. snowboards are too emo for me. give it ten more years and that fad will be dead.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{that's what they said about rap.}
<A>__{parker removes a cigarette and lights it.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{mmm mmm. smell that fresh mountain air, huh? kind of smells like... cancer.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you know what, i am so sick of potheads giving me shit about smoking butts.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{at least pot does something for you. cigarettes are just gross. especially out in the cold. it like sticks to you and then you smell like a mixture of ash tray and an old man's used floss.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{used floss? where do you come up with this shit.}
<C>__{lynch}
<B>__{e}
<D>__{have you ever sniffed your floss? it's nasty.}
<A>__{dan and lynch both crack up at this, huge.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{no, i have never why would i ever sniff my floss? why am i friends with you?}
<A>__{parker blows more smoke out.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{gimme a drag.}
<A>__{he takes her cigarette from her.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what time do you think we'll get back? i have about 2 weeks worth of chapters to read tonight.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{oh no. she broke the rule.}
<P>__{(to parker)}
<D>__{parker you just broke the first rule.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{no worrying about the bullshit of real life. the whole point of this is to relax and have fun. worry about school when you get home.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{but, i haven't read a }
<A>__{the chair suddenly stops and lurches forward slightly. the sound of the chair lift cuts out. a deep silence takes over quickly, like the type of silence that used to suddenly happen in school when you were taking a test and the radiator that you never even noticed was on would suddenly shut off. random skiers and boarders in the surrounding chairs express their disgust for the delay. parker instinctively grabs dan's hand.}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{it's alright.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{uh oh! is someone afraid of heights?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{so it doesn't bother you when i do this?}
<A>__{lynch rocks the chair back and forth. parker grabs hold of the safety bar.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{quit it!}
<A>__{dan motions to lynch to stop.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{i'm not afraid of heights. i just don't like them.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{baby, in the whole history of time, only one chair has ever fallen off of a lift.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{points for calling me "baby" but you just made that statistic up.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{yeah, statistics don't work on smokers.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(nervous laughter)}
<D>__{oh, shut up.}
<A>__{lynch turns around and yells behind him.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{ok, what asshole couldn't get on the chair right?}
<A>__{laughter echoes from the chairs behind him. he yells forward.}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{come on, i paid good money to do some skiing!}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{actually, i paid good money.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{yeah, but i'm gonna pay you back so it's like the same thing.}
<A>__{with a lurch, the chair starts moving forward again and the whirring sound of the cables above them start up again. applause is heard from all of the other chairs.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{that's what i'm talking about! woo!}
<A>__{dan lets go of parker's hand and gives her a smile. she smiles back. he playfully sticks his tongue out at her and she laughs as their chair moves forward exiting frame.}
<L>__{exterior top of the chair lift later}
<A>__{the three begin to get situated with their boards and skis.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{why do i have to wear a helmet?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{safety first.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{but you guys don't wear them.}
<A>__{she looks around.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{i only see little kids wearing them.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{cause they're still learning, too. come on, i'm not gonna argue about this.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{even extreme boarders wear helmets. nobody makes fun of them.}
<A>__{she begrudgingly puts on her helmet. she's not happy about it. dan and lynch smile.}
<D>__{dan lynch awww.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you're just doing this to make fun of me.}
<A>__{dan's laughing.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{no, i'm not. i swear. you look hot in a helmet.}
<A>__{off to the side, lynch spots shannon (cute, brunette, 20's) struggling with her boot strap. she falls down on her ass. lynch nonchalantly maneuvers over to her side.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{need some help?}
<C>__{shannon}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{do you think?}
<A>__{lynch puts out a hand to help her and pulls her up almost directly into his face. parker and dan watch from afar as lynch helps her with her boot strap. he has one hand innocently on the back of her knee and he is fastening the strap with his other.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{aww, check out lynch.}
<A>__{from their point of view, they watch lynch helping the girl.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{see? chick magnet.}
<A>__{almost as if on cue, ryan (an enormous dude, 20's) stomps over and shoves lynch down into the snow.}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<A>__{lynch tries to get up.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{woah! shit, man! i was just trying to help!}
<A>__{instantly, dan moves over to lynch's aid. parker follows slowly behind him. she's clearly not too good on her board.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{ryan, what the hell?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{he had his hands all over you!}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{no he didn't. i can take care of myself!}
<A>__{she shoves him back. ryan just shakes his head at her and shoves off, away from the group. he waits for her down the hill a few feet. dan and shannon help lynch to his feet.}
<C>__{shannon }
<D>__{i am so sorry about that. he can be such an asshole sometimes.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i was seriously just trying to help. i mean, how could i even compete with a catch like that?}
<A>__{he waves to ryan. ryan just looks away.}
<C>__{shannon}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{are you ok?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{yeah, i'm fine.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{well, thank you for your help. i am so, so sorry about that.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i'm shannon, by the way.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{joe.}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{ryan}
<P>__{(calling to her)}
<D>__{shan!}
<A>__{shannon rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{well it was nice to meet you.}
<A>__{she takes off after ryan.}
<C>__{lynch}
<P>__{(to his friends)}
<D>__{i was like one second away from beating that guy's ass.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i know you were, man. come on. don't sweat it.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{seriously, that guy was such a dick.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{come on boys. we can talk about how tough you both are at the bottom.}
<A>__{lynch starts down the hill.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i'm tough.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i know you are.}
<A>__{they push off out of frame.}
<L>__{exterior ski trail later}
<A>__{dan, parker, and lynch move down the mountain on their snow boards and skis. quick cuts of dan helping parker learn. lynch impatiently waits. finally, parker comes to a stop on her own next to dan and he claps for her.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{look at you! see? having fun?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{are you kidding? we are totally doing this every weekend. in fact, if they were open during the week i'd say we should cut class, too.}
<A>__{lynch suddenly flies over the hill and sprays both of them down with powder.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{last one to the bottom is buying dinner!}
<A>__{he eats it mere seconds later and lands on his ass. parker and dan take off laughing while lynch feebly tries to get back on his feet.}
<L>__{interior ski lodge early evening}
<A>__{parker gets herself some hot chocolate in the distance while dan and lynch pick at what's left of a pizza on the table in front of them.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we gotta take a weekend trip up north one of these days. hit up killington or okemo and really do it up right.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{why don't we just do it over christmas. you and me.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{done. when i stayed with my cousin out west two years ago it was like the stuff you see in commercials. we had to take like 3 lifts to get to the top and it was powder as far as you could see.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{well, speaking of good skiing... it's been cool doing the bunny hill all day but do you think we could get one real run in before we leave tonight?}
<A>__{dan feels bad.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{dude, you didn't have to stay with us. it's totally cool if you want to go off for a few.}
<A>__{parker is now walking back to their table behind lynch and is pretty much right on top of them.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{no, it's fine. i'm just saying let's step it up a notch at some pointerior it's been cool watching parker fall on her ass all day but i would like to actually ski at some pointerior}
<A>__{parker feels horrible.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you know, i've probably had enough for today anyway. i can just stay in the lodge if you guys want to go }
<A>__{now lynch feels horrible.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{ no, no, no that's not what i meant. i didn't mean it like that.}
<A>__{parker looks to dan.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i told you i didn't have to come.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{parker, i didn't not want you to come.}
<A>__{dan tries to help.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{it was his idea that we invited you in the first place.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{exactly. remember? i was like "hey man, why doesn't parker come with us?" and you were like }
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{ i was like, "ok that would be cool".}
<B>__{e}
<A>__{parker isn't buying it. she puts on a smile.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{it's ok, you guys. the last thing a girl wants to do is intrude on "guy time". i won't be offended. i've got stuff i could do anyway.}
<P>__{(to dan)}
<D>__{actually, can i have the key? i should check my messages.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{no. no locker key. i can tell you right now that every message on there is going to be from your mom giving you more aggravation about whatever the hell.}
<A>__{parker laughs.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{she does not.}
<A>__{dan looks to lynch.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{ready for this? two nights ago we were watching a movie and her mom kept calling and calling.}
<P>__{(to parker)}
<D>__{and what did she want?}
<A>__{parker laughs.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{she wanted to know if we wanted to have chicken soup or vegetable soup with christmas dinner. christmas dinner! four weeks away, and she had to now right then and there what kind of soup we'd prefer.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{what did you say? you said chicken.}
<C>__{dan}
<B>__{e}
<D>__{hell yes, i said chicken, but that's not the pointerior}
<P>__{(to parker)}
<D>__{the point is you can go a few more hours without hearing from annette.}
<A>__{parker looks to lynch.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i'm sorry if i ruined skiing for you today.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{you didn't! you didn't at all! you missed the part before you walked over here when i was all like, "dude, this has been so cool...you know...doing..."}
<A>__{parker and dan are beaming at him. he knows he's beat.}
<C>__{lynch }
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{what?}
<L>__{exterior front of lodge moments later, night}
<A>__{parker, dan, and lynch come out of the lodge. from their pov the chair lift is still moving but the line is empty. they start to move to the empty lift line when...}

<D>__{joe!}
<C>__{lynch}
<P>__{(to his friends)}
<D>__{wait up.}
<A>__{lynch walks over to shannon while dan and parker move towards the lift line.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{hey. i just wanted to apologize again.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{oh, no big deal. he's just lucky he didn't make me mad. you know, i just look half your boyfriend's size.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{ex. he's my ex boyfriend. we're, you know, trying to still be friends and everything but as you can see, that's not really gonna work.}
<C>__{lynch}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{a group of us all agreed to go skiing this weekend and well, whatever. it's a whole story and }
<A>__{she looks over at dan and parker.}
<C>__{shannon }
<D>__{ i don't want to hold you up. but that was just really embarrassing. so i just wanted to say sorry.}

<D>__{i know right? they're supposed to stay open until 10 on sundays. whatever happened to night skiing?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{wachusett still has night skiing. we should have gone there. it's kinda like ward hill but not as lame.}

<P>__{(then)}

<C>__{dan}
<D>__{what do you think the worst way to die would be?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{that's not morbid.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{yeah, seriously. that's kinda spooky, dan.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i think getting eaten by a shark would be the worst way to go.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{not if it was like one of those surfers where they get hit from behind and they don't even know what happened.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know. cause it like came up from beneath them.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{like on the jaws poster.}
<C>__{lynch}

<C>__{parker}
<D>__{she was?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i don't know. she was naked. naked chicks are hot.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{but if you actually like saw the fin coming for you in the water. that would be worse than actually getting eaten. knowing that this animal is coming for you but you can't get away. and that it's going to eat you. like you're gonna get eaten alive? have you guys ever seen that footage of the great white jumping out of the water to eat that seal?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{that's why i only swim in pools.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i think burning to death would be the worst.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{well yes and no. because most people die of the smoke inhalation before any fire even hits them.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i remember watching tv for like 3 days straight after 9 11. that footage that they kept showing of all of those people leaping off of the top of the trade center? can you imagine how bad it was inside to know that jumping was a better way out?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{but they say that when you jump from that high up your heart stops before you hit the ground and you don't even feel it.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{ok, then lynch. what is the worst way to die?}
<C>__{lynch}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{no, you have an answer for everything. what's your biggest fear?}
<A>__{lynch has been waiting for this.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{easy. the sarlaac pit.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{the sarlaac pit. from return of the jedi? hel lo...being slowly digested over 1,000 years? worst. death. ever.}

<D>__{give it a minute.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{this is nothing man. at stowe last year, me and solet were stranded for like 25 minutes. this big chick fell getting off up top and twisted her leg. it was like "move her to the side and keep the line going people". but no. they had to stop and celebrate it right there and we all had to }

<C>__{parker}

<D>__{what did you say to the guy?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{me? nothing!}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do this.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i didn't do anything! he knows we're still up here.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{then why are the lights off, dan? is that part of their policy? shut off the lights and scare the customers?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{they just lost power or something. i'm sure it's gonna come back on any second.}

<B>__{e}
<C>__{dan}

<C>__{dan}
<D>__{it's true. i've done it before. you just get tired of waiting, you wait for a spot with some serious powder and you just jump. it's actually kind of fun, but they can ban you from the mountain for it.}

<D>__{no. i dumped her. we were in the cafeteria, right? and i was sitting facing her, facing the wall...and she was facing everyone in the cafeteria behind me. and i kept seeing her smiling at someone behind me and like, almost laughing. so i was like, "who are you laughing at?" you know? like "what the hell is going on?" and she's like, "dean's making fun of you."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so i turn around, and i'm like ready to kick the shit out of this guy. and all i see is a sea of fucking random people. just all of these faces. this guy could see me and was making eyes with my girlfriend...but i couldn't see him.}

<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{you have no idea. but then, the teacher... mrs... what was her name? mrs. schifrin? she was trying everything to get the fat kid to stop crying. and so she says, "well dan, is there anyone else in the class that you know?" you know, like, "maybe there's a friend you'd like to sit with?" and the fucker points right at me and says "him"! i had never seen this kid before in my life, you know? but for whatever reason, he points right at me.}

<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{no. no it's not.}
<A>__{slowly he makes his way the remaining distance and positions himself over the other chair. he drops down onto it, sending shards of ice cascading down into the snow below. he quickly sits down, breathing heavy and clutching the sides of the chair.}

<D>__{i said throw my pole as far as you can this way. when i get on the ground i will need some defense.}

<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{rrrrugh!}
<A>__{this gets the wolves attention. in the bushes their ears and eyes perk up to the sky, watching their potential next meal grapple with the high wire cable. with reserved strength, lynch shimmies across the cable as quickly as he can. back at parker's chair, she eyes the bending metal bolt that}

<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{please god, don't let me fall. don't let me fall.}
<A>__{he stops once to catch his breath, but begins moving as quickly as possible. finally, he reaches the second chair behind them and drops down into it. looking at the lift pole from this position, he can clearly see that it wasn't as close to the chair as it looked. but it's possible.}
