<L>__{exterior rough road evening}
<A>__{della turns to see headlights in the distance on the road behind, pointing upwards.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{huh!}
<A>__{the plymouth must have skidded and got stuck in the mud.}
<L>__{exterior edge of woods evening}
<A>__{she closes the trunk softly then runs to the front of the car, clutching the toolbox and the wrench. she reaches back into the car and unlatches the hood from underneath the dash. pop. she softly closes the door again. punches her way through the branches. slides her fingers under the hood, pries up the lever. it pops up only a few inches.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{damn!}
<A>__{she tries to manually lift it. but it's heavy with the weight of pine branches. voices drift towards her.}
<C>__{tomas }
<D>__{keep hitting on the gas and you gonna dig them wheels into a dirt grave.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{save yo talk and get out and push.}
<A>__{the sound of car doors opening, feet squishing into the mud and cussing. the boys materialize in the light from the headlights.}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{hell, no.}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{shit!}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{what's aggravating you now?}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{our new sneakers are stuck up in the dirt like they was last years.}
<A>__{doors slam and two sets of footsteps join the others.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{soon as we taken care o' mrs. podunk you and the spanish dancer can hit the next mall. but first you fakers best haul this rider out of the filth.}
<C>__{vinh}

<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{screw the car, chuckie. case you forgot we got a witness on the loose! i ain't want to end up in the clink as some chimp's prison pillow.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{trust me dog, hoe's going down execution style before we see the other side o' them bars.}
<A>__{della drops the hood. it makes a faint squeak but doesn't slam down, seems it's stuck open these last few inches.}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{yo talk a real mob threat, chuckie. but what if she gone already?}
<A>__{chuckie's eyes scan the housing estate.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{she ain't gone.}
<A>__{della frantically sweeps pine branches and cones from the hood. but some larger branches are jammed, wedged by the broken tree. when she looks back over for the boys she sees the car headlights are off and there's no sign of them. she stands stock still, listening, scanning the landscape for a sign of them. the sound of glass shattering breaks the silence. della jumps out of her skin, spins around. her eyes settle on a light in the distance.}
