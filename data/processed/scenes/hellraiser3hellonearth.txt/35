<L>__{interior jp's private room night}
<A>__{jp, on his bed in his shorts enjoying a post coital cigarette, blows smoke rings at the ceiling and all but ignores sandy. sandy has put some of her clothes back on and is wandering around the room, admiring it and chattering.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{so cool ...}
<A>__{she approaches the pillar ... leans in close ... closer ... and ... nothing happens.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{radical.}
<A>__{she walks on to look at a painting on one of the walls.}
<B>__{angle on painting}
<A>__{it's a painstakingly rendered but crudely imagined piece. the kind of crap you'd buy in a melrose gallery. perhaps it's called biker crucifixion. night time, somewhere rural. a hell's angel, arms outstretched and stripped to the waist, is tied to a tree by cruelly tight barbed wire wrapped around his body. at the foot of the tree his biker friends party, drink, and fuck, harleys parked in the distance. the crucified angel's eyes are raised to the moon. he's smiling.}
<B>__{wider angle on sandy and painting}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{wow. you've got great taste. this ... well ... this really says it, you know? it's really ... dark.}
<B>__{angle on jp}
<A>__{still staring at the ceiling, jp pulls a pained face like he's heard this embarrassing shit a hundred times.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{don't you think?}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{mmn hmnn.}
<A>__{sandy turns to look at jp, troubled by his unresponsiveness.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{do you mind me talking about your stuff?}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{unh unh.}
<A>__{a beat. sandy stares at jp. jp stares at the ceiling.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{if it bothers you, just say so.}
<A>__{jp sighs.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{it doesn't bother me. i'm just not interested.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{oh. like i'm not an interesting person.}
<A>__{jp blows a smoke ring at the ceiling. sandy walks back across the room to stand at the foot of the bed. ( and yes, fright fans, this does put her in front of the pillar though hopefully the blossoming argument will distract audience attention.)}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{but you gave me a rose ...}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{and tomorrow i will give one to somebody else. get dressed. get out.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{you shit. who do you think you are?}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{i'm jp monroe, you stupid little bitch. now get the fuck out of my life.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{you ... i can't fucking believe you, you bastard! you get me in here ...}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{right. like you were hog tied or something.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{look at you! you think you're some god damn prince or something. with your shitty little kingdom out there and all this ugly shi ....}
<A>__{sandy is waving her arms to illustrate her point and, halfway through her last line, has turned to indicate the pillar. suddenly bam! big scare moment! two blackened arms fly out from the center of the pillar and grab sandy's gesturing arms. the blue light burns from within, illuminating pinhead's face as his eyes open, filled with demonic glee and hunger. an impossible wind begins to whistle through the room, as if an echoed glimpse of a storm in hell. sandy screams in mortal terror. jp jumps from the bed, cigarette falling to the floor. he backs away to the opposite wall, face shocked, scared shitless.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<A>__{pinhead smiles sardonically.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{not quite.}
<A>__{pinhead's arms pull sandy tight against the pillar and his face, stifling her scream. jp flattened against the far wall, watches in horror as sandy, held tight against the pillar, suffers a horrible death: sandy's life force is sucked from her. drawn into the pillar. into pinhead. it is a matter of seconds only but, in those few seconds her body begins to collapse in on itself, turning grey and lifeless. it is made worse by the fact that until the very end sandy keeps struggling, writhing in the grasp of the monster. the wind keeps blowing through the room. finally, a dry lifeless husk, she is dropped to the floor. the blue light fades from within the pillar. the wind disappears. the pillar is again black and stationary. but its contours are different, more rounded. it looks more organic, as if shifting its raw material into new alignments, new configurations. the pillar seems to be in a process of becoming. and the obvious suggestion is that what it is becoming is pinhead. pinhead's head, arms, and torso now protrude from the pillar. they are not completely free and now that the "eating" of sandy is concluded seem incapable of independent movement but there is plainly a lot more of him than there was before. even though the blue light has faded, pinhead's face is noticeably different. it is blue tinged and more fleshy in appearance. capable of movement. and speech.}
<B>__{angle on jp}
<A>__{ who has sunk to the floor, staring at the pillar.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{what ... what ... ?}
<B>__{wider angle}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{what did you see? the same as i. appetite sated. desire indulged. you saw the working of the world in miniature.}
<A>__{jp shakes his head in denial. but he's already a little more together than he was: after all, the pillar can't move and he's several yards from it.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{that had nothing to do with the world. not this one, anyway.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{on the contrary. it has everything to do with the world. and our dreams of how it will succumb to us. you enjoyed the girl?}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{good. so did i. and that's all ...}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{no! no. it's not the same ... i ... no. what you did ... it was ... evil.}
<A>__{pinhead laughs.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{how uncomfortable that word must feel on your lips. evil. good. there is no good, monroe. there is no evil. there is only the flesh and the patterns to which we can submit it. you will help me to ...}
<A>__{jp shakes his head in furious denial.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{no. no no no. no fuckin' way. i'm gone ...}
<A>__{grabbing at his jeans, jp heads out of his room. rapidly.}
