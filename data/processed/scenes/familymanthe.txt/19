<L>__{interior jack's outer office continuous}
<A>__{...continuing past adelle's desk, jack looking at his messages, and into jack's office...}
<L>__{interior jack's office continuous}
<A>__{a cavernous office, you could land a helicopter in it high tech fixtures, full bar, leather sofa, $3,000 stairmaster... jack walks to an enormous, bare mahogany desk, and sits down in a high tech ergonomic leather chair.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{oh, and oxxford called...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ooh, my suits are ready...}
<A>__{he gets to the last message, sees the name on it, and reels back.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{kate reynolds...}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.}
<A>__{jack stares at the message like he's looking at a ghost.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{her assistant?}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{yeah jack, her assistant...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(lost in the message)}
<D>__{kate reynolds was my girlfriend in college. i almost married her...}
<C>__{adelle}
<P>__{(a hearty laugh)}
<D>__{you? married?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(snapping out of it)}
<D>__{almost married. and almost a junior broker at e.f. hutton...}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she didn't want me to go to london. we're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{so you left her? just like that?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{god, no. i thought about it for practically the entire flight...}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{stop jack, i'm getting all weepy.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i took the road less traveled, adelle.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{and look where it's led you...}
<P>__{(picking up the phone)}
<D>__{i'm gonna get her on the phone...}
<A>__{jack pauses, focused on the message, his mind drifting back... adelle begins dialing the number. finally, jack reaches out and hangs up the phone.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{no?! you almost married this woman. aren't you even curious what she wants?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she's probably just having a fit of nostalgia. you know, lonely christmas eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.}
<A>__{adelle rolls her eyes at him.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i'm telling you, it's ancient history...}
<A>__{jack looks up as peter lassiter, 60s, founder and chairman of p.k. lassiter and associates, saunters into the room.}
<C>__{lassiter}
<D>__{eight forty five on christmas eve and jack campbell is still at his desk. there's a hallmark moment for you...}
<A>__{lassiter heads to the bar like he's done it a million times.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{peter. i don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.}
<C>__{lassiter}
<P>__{(pouring himself a scotch)}
<D>__{that's because i'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and god love you for it.}
<A>__{lassiter drops down in a soft leather chair opposite jack.}
<C>__{lassiter}
<P>__{(sipping the scotch)}
<D>__{i just got a call from terry haight. bob thomas is nervous...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...}
<C>__{lassiter}
<D>__{someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why are you staring at my breasts, peter?}
<C>__{lassiter}
<D>__{i need you, tiger..}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{lassiter}
<D>__{aspen.}
<A>__{jack pauses for a beat.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to adelle)}
<D>__{call aunt irma. tell her i won't be able to make it tomorrow...}
<A>__{adelle rolls her eyes at him...}
<C>__{lassiter}
<D>__{you're a credit to capitalism, jack.}
<A>__{jack glances at adelle, then looks back at lassiter.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey peter, lemme ask you a question. an old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on christmas eve...}
<C>__{lassiter}
<D>__{you suddenly having trouble getting dates?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{not by a long shot.}
<C>__{lassiter}
<D>__{then leave it in the past. old flames are like old tax returns. you keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.}
<A>__{jack shoots adelle a satisfied smile, crumpling up kate's message and tossing a perfect hook into a n.y. knicks hoop.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to adelle)}
<D>__{i will leave from the office tomorrow afternoon. call the group. schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{that'll be a nice little holiday treat.}
