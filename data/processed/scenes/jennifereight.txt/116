<L>__{115: exterior rear of institute. fire escape. night.}
<A>__{close on a bulb in a flashlight. the merest glimmer of energy. barely the light to see the blood. it seeps into a long frozen footprint in the ice. fills it fast and expands over the sides. somebody say this can't be happening? berlin crumples to knees in the snow. dumps his light gasping for breath. oblique light creating desperate silhouettes. berlin howls like a dog. howls into his radio. "nine nine nine." blood all over his hands. "this is a nine nine nine officer down." ross is heaving like an old bull elephant. on the verge of unconsciousness. he tries to speak. got hit in the throat. berlin fights off tears. "don't talk old man." repeats the emergency code but this time he can't be heard. almost imperceptibly a carol filters in (in the bleak mid winter) and the camera moves slowly away. berlin cradles ross's tragic head and the song drowns the raging wind. this beautiful christmas carol will articulate rhythm of these cuts. and there will be no other sound until the sequence ends.}
