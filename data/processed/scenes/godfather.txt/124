<L>__{ext day: mall (spring 1946)}
<A>__{high angle on the corleone mall. it is a gray, rainy day. young button men in raincoats stand in quiet groups of various points around the main house and compound. things have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new and secure gate house has been built. security measures that had been make shift and temporarily have now been made a permanent part of the mall, evolving it into a medieval fortress. we notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the result of a recent bomb attempt. the house nearest the crater is damaged by fire. a taxi arrives; kay adams steps out, huddled in a bright yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the shelter of the gate house. they are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they call the main house. kay looks at the imposing, depressing mall, while rain still runs down onto her face. she notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the sullen faces of the button men. tom hagen exits the main house, and hurries toward her.}

<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{nobody knows where he is. we know he's all right, but that's all.}
<A>__{kay looks in the direction of the crater, filling with rainwater.}

<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{an accident. no one was hurt.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{listen tom, i let my cab go; can i come in to call another one?}
<A>__{tom is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has to.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{sure...i'm sorry.}
<A>__{they hurry through the rain and into the main house.}
