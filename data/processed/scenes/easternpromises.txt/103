<L>__{exterior london street night}
<D>__{anna and nikolai ride through london streets.}
<L>__{exterior nine elms. abandoned dock night}
<D>__{on the edge of the dockside, kirill is kneeling with the zip up bag before him. suddenly fireworks begin to burst over the thames. it is the stroke of midnight. kirill unzips the bag. when he looks inside christine stops crying. he peers at her, wiping away tears.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{she's a little girl, papa, a little sweet fucking girl... kirill sobs then christine cries...}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{shush, shush... kirill lifts her out of the bag and holds her close to him, fireworks still illuminating the london skyline. he looks down at the freezing cold water, utterly confused. he whispers...}
<C>__{kirill }
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, my little sister. for a moment we believe he is going to throw her into the water. instead he begins to sing a lullaby to her and her crying stops. then we see a single light behind him. in a firework flash we see nikolai and anna climbing off the bike. they approach cautiously. kirill stares at the man he loves. a pause. christine begins to cry.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{kirill, let me take the baby.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{you stay where you are.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{she's cold, kirill. kirill suddenly screams as another barrage of fireworks explodes. nikolai doesn't move. kirill is dangerously close to the edge of the dock. maybe he'll throw himself in too.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{kirill, a vor doesn't kill little babies. kirill is motionless.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{something like this would be bad for all of us. your dad has gone too far, kirill. a pause.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{it's our turn now. nikolai steps forward slowly. as he gets closer kirill hugs the baby. finally nikolai reaches kirill and hugs him. as he does he edges him away from the dockside. the three of them are locked in a long embrace. nikolai emerges from the embrace with christine in his arms. he quickly hands her to anna who hugs her close. kirill turns to nikolai.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{i swear i didn't know my dad was setting you up.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{he's going away. when he's gone the family business will be yours. a pause.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{we can be partners again. thunder and lightning, right? kirill smiles through his tears and nods.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{get into the car. i will drive you home. a pause. kirill dries his eyes and heads for the car. nikolai looks at anna, who is hugging the baby. he waits a long time before realizing he must leave her.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{you're ok, yeah? anna nods.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{who are you really? why have you helped us? nikolai can't answer truthfully, though he longs to do so. there is a long pause before he manages to finds a suitable lie.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{how can i become king if the king is still in place? a pause. he laughs. anna studies him, unsure. more new year fireworks explode over the river. kirill yells from the car...}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{you come on, nikolai! we're missing the fucking party of the year out there!! get here and drive!!}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{that's a fucking order!! nikolai and anna peer at each other.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{maybe i can drive you somewhere? she shakes her head.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{there's someone i can call. he'll come and fetch us. nikolai nods, not liking the information but hiding it. nikolai comes close and gently uncovers christine's face. he smiles. kirill is hooting the car horn. after a moment nikolai and anna kiss each other gently before nikolai heads for the car.}
