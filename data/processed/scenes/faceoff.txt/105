<L>__{exterior garage night}
<A>__{the automatic door lifts revealing tito's old buick. the big v 8 rumbles as archer pulls out. he doesn't get far as... menacing cholos block his way.}
<D>__{cholo # 1 where are you going? cholo #2 ten bucks he's the guy who popped tito!}
<A>__{the cholos surround the buick. archer's cornered like an animal as the angry teens pound on the windows. archer hits the gas scattering all except cholo #1 who jumps on the hood. archer slams the brakes sending the guy flying. he lands hard, but is only shaken up. as archer roars off, cholo #1 pulls out his cell phone.}
<D>__{cholo #1 9 1 1? i want to report a stolen car and don't put me on hold!}
