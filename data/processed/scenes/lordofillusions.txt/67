<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{valentin sitting on the mausoleum steps reading a book. he glances up. harry and dorothea are wandering between the graves, deep in conversation.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{i want you to help me help my husband. i know he's in some kind of trouble. and it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{did your husband know quaid?}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{yes. they weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while. i think philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you don't?}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{i think we make our own futures.}
<A>__{harry makes an approving murmur.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what's the connection?}
<C>__{dorothea}
<P>__{(covering now, but well)}
<D>__{i don't exactly know. philip doesn't like to talk about the past.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{dorothea stops talking. takes off her sunglasses. her gaze is troubled, but direct. there is an attraction between the two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{he's a secretive man.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and you don't ask questions?}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{we don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{does that mean...?}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{we haven't slept in the same bed for years.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{but obviously you still care what happens to him.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{we wouldn't be having this conversation if i didn't. swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.}
<A>__{harry, frowns.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{you don't believe me.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{he's an illusionist. it's not exactly brain surgery.}
<A>__{dorothea stares at him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sorry. you asked.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{no. you're right. he could have been something more. maybe a lot more. but people get lost. even good people. too much fame. too much money,}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{where do i sign?}
<A>__{dorothea laughs lightly.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{will you take the job, mr. d'amour?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{harry.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm no bodyguard.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{that's not what i'm asking for. i want somebody who can find out what philip saw in those damn cards. and stop it from happening.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{when do you want me to start?}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{come to the show with me. tonight i want you to see him with an audience. they love him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{do you?}
<A>__{the question catches dorothea off guard.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{i didn't marry him for love, mr. d'amour. tonight?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{dorothea makes a little smile, and walks away. harry watches her go, exhaling an appreciative breath at the sight of her departing figure.}
