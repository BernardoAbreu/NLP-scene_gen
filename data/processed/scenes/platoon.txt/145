<A>__{but the second sapper runs right into the bunker in a kamikaze charge, the light from inside momentarily revealing a bulky satchel strapped on his person and the face of the astounded major.}
<C>__{rto 3}
<D>__{sir!!}
<L>__{exterior perimeter #3 battalion cp night}
<A>__{the bunker explodes with a deafening roar.}
<L>__{exterior perimeter #3 chris' foxhole night}
<A>__{in their foxhole, chris and francis look at the curling ball of flame, stunned.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{oh no!}
<L>__{exterior perimeter #3 company cp night}
<A>__{in their foxhole, chris points.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{there!}
<A>__{shapes moving in the trees. chris blows his claymore handles. one explosion on top of the other out front. then return fire. flashes from a muzzle, rak a tak, rak a tak, rak a tak, the heavier sound of an ak 47. chris opening up with his 16. then being blown down by a grenade explosion at the edge of the foxhole. then nothing. a pause. chris' ears ringing, slightly concussed. suddenly from down the perimeter there is the sound of a faulty loudspeaker crackling out from the jungle. a pidgen english, the words mauled, then a snatch of patriotic north vietnamese music, played from a scratchy old record. chris uneasy, looking at francis who looks terrified. the sound now of a whistle. two hoots, then a sharp third. then yelling. chris grabbing francis' arm, pointing. there is a voice directly out to the front of them muttering something in vietnamese, no more than 20 yards away but unseen. it's like hearing a casual conversation from another room, then the sounds of several bodies moving in separate directions encompassing the foxhole.}
<C>__{chris }
<P>__{(to francis, a whisper)}
<D>__{out of the hole! fast!}
<A>__{chris crawls out, stops, looks back. francis won't leave, hugs the shelter.}
<C>__{chris }
<P>__{(a fierce whisper)}
<D>__{goddamit francis! move your fucking ass. now ... they gonna blow it!}
<A>__{reaches in and yanks him with all his strength half out of the hole. francis, finally sparked, now moves out. both of them bellying it into the brush behind the hole. not a moment too soon. an rpg rocket whistling in. the foxhole takes a direct hit, caving in, whirls of smoke spinning off it. chris and francis look back covered with debris. they hear movement. shadows are swarming towards the foxhole, firing into it to finish them off. francis grabs chris' leg, indicating they get out of there. chris hesitates a moment, a decision made now in angry passion rises up and charges the nva. shadows scatter and tumble, caught by his surprise close range fire. chris moving forward into them, blasting, agile, his instincts finely tuned, and totally insane in this moment of time, indifferent to his life. he yells insanities, pumping himself up with the adrenaline of courage.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{die you motherfuckers!!! yaaaaaaaaa!!!}
<A>__{screams from the dark shadows, they fall. chris smashing a wounded shadow with the butt of his gun down into the foxhole. he jumps back into it, reoccupying it. blasting the dead gook. opening fire out to the front, driving the shadows back. francis watching this, amazed. after a moment of doubt, he too tears back out to join chris in the foxhole, unbelieving, as he jumps in with him.}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(joining in the frenzy)}
<D>__{yaaaaahhhh!!!! killlll!!!}
<A>__{then stunned again to see chris suddenly rise up out of the foxhole and charging forward into the jungle. he is now over the edge.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(charging off into the jungle)}
<D>__{die you motherfuckers!!!}
