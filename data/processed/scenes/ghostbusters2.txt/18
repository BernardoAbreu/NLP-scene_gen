<L>__{interior wkrr tv studio reception area day (later)}
<A>__{a bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on wkrr, channel 10 in new york. we push in on one of the monitors as a title card and logo come up accompanied by some eerie synthesizer music, and we return to the show in progress: "world of the psychic with dr. peter venkman." there is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and sitting there is our host peter venkman, the renowned and somewhat infamous ex ghostbuster.}
<B>__{venkman}
<A>__{he turns to camera and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone, understated and intimate.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{hi, welcome back to the 'world of the psychic,' i'm peter venkman and i'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, milton anglund.}
<P>__{(to his guest)}
<D>__{milt, your new book is called the end of the world. isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease. yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{well, i think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{i predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on new year's eve.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{this year? that's cutting it a little close, isn't it? i mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right? so you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year. and it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie of the week or mini series potential. you would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.}
<C>__{milton}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{this is not just some money making scheme! i didn't just make up the date. i have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on new year's eve.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(placating)}
<D>__{well, for your sake, i hope you're right. but i think my other guest may disagree with you. elaine, you had another date in mind?}
<A>__{the camera reveals elaine, an attractive, aggressive new jersey housewife, sitting on the other side of venkman.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{according to my sources, the world will end on february 14, in the year 2016.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{valentine's day. that's got to be a bummer. where did you get that date, elaine?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i received this information from an alien. i was at the paramus holiday inn, i was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking. then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{your alien had a room in the holiday inn?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{it may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the holiday inn. i can't be sure, peter.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(humoring her)}
<D>__{no, you can't, and i think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. you may get some nice ones occasionally like starman or e.t., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard. anyway, we're just about out of time.}
<P>__{(does his wrap up right to the camera)}
<D>__{next week on 'world of the psychic,' hairless pets.}
<P>__{(holds up a hairless cat)}
<D>__{until then, this is peter venkman saying ...}
<P>__{(puts a finger to his temple}
<D>__{and sends out a though to his}
<P>__{viewers)}
<D>__{... good night.}
