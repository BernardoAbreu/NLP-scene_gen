<L>__{interior restroom stall heathrow airport day}
<A>__{koj has ramirez's head with one hand, while he holds the gun on him with the other. he forces ramirez's head down deep into the toilet bowl. he flushes. the water level sinks and then rises, covering ramirez's face. koj holds him under water long enough to almost drown him. then, instead of lifting his head out, he flushes again and the water level lowers.}
<C>__{koj}
<D>__{tell me what i want to know quickly or you're dead.}
<A>__{just then ramirez manages to kick back and overpower koj and send him flying back out through the door of the stall. ramirez is back on him in a second but koj has his gun up and pointed right at ramirez's head. they have shifted position now, so that they are not facing the stall, but the door of the bathroom. koj is about to pull the trigger when we hear:}
<C>__{amos }
<D>__{down!!}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{ramirez ducks and rolls out of the way and amos fires two shots into koj's chest but not before koj can get off a round right into amos' chest. in an instant ramirez is on the still alive koj grabbing his head in his hands and slamming it down onto the edge of the sink with a thud that cracks his skull. he quickly crosses to amos who is dying.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{get out of here... now...}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i've got to get you to a doctor.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{get out now...}
<A>__{ramirez cradles him.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i'm not going to let you die here... i've still got a lawsuit against you, remember?}
<A>__{here, amos speaks as a doomed father would to a son who still has a chance to save himself from the holocaust.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{my dear boy... my dear dear boy... i am dead. please god, don't let it all be for nothing... get out now...}
<A>__{ramirez stands as amos literally pushes him away. ramirez is the brave and dutiful son as his father says, coaching, teaching him to the last...}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{walk slowly... no attention.}
<A>__{ramirez is ashen faced, knows amos is right and forces himself to stand up and walk almost robot like out of the restroom.}
