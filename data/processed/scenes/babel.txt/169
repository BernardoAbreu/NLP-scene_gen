<D>__{it is well into the morning. amelia and the children sleep deeply. there is a noise and amelia opens her eyes. she sees a border patrol truck driving around near them.}
<A>__{looking through the branches, she spies on the truck and watches another one join it. mike awakes and sits up.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what happening?}
<A>__{amelia ducks and lays mike face down. the two trucks slowly approach.}
<C>__{amelia}
<P>__{(to mike, in a low voice, in spanish)}
<D>__{stay still.}
<A>__{a truck drives by about eighty yards away and then passes. the other one cuts diagonally across its path and then gets lost in the desert. amelia gets up and shakes off the dust. she looks out of place, wearing her best clothes torn by the bramble. she makes sure the trucks are leaving.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{why are we hiding if we didn't do anything wrong?}
<C>__{amelia}
<P>__{(in english)}
<D>__{because they think we did something wrong.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{that's not true: you're bad.}
<A>__{amelia freezes upon hearing the boy's words.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{no, sweetie, i'm not bad. i just did something stupid.}
<A>__{she pulls him toward her and hugs him tenderly.}
<C>__{amelia }
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{i love you very much, sweetie.}
<A>__{amelia turns and tries to wake debbie.}
<C>__{amelia }
<P>__{(in english)}
<D>__{debbie, we've got to go.}
<A>__{the girl opens her eyes, but doesn't answer.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{debbie, sweetheart, wake up. she closes her eyes again. amelia notices her lips are dry and her breath is irregular: she is visibly dehydrated. upon seeing that she doesn't react, amelia looks for the trucks: they're far away.}
