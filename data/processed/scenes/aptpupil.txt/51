<L>__{interior dussander's kitchen day}
<A>__{dussander sits at the table. he holds the iop card out at arm's length to read it. the bourbon bottle next to him is empty. todd sits across from him.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{well, this calls for a celebration, no?}
<A>__{dussander gets up and goes to the refrigerator.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{look, i guess i owe a lot of this to you. i'm not proud of it, but it's true.}
<C>__{dussander}
<P>__{(eyeing him cautiously)}
<D>__{your gratitude humbles me.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{how about some ritz crackers and velveeta?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{sure, what the hell.}
<A>__{dussander goes about his task, taking items from the cabinets, etc. todd watches all of this intently, but without expression.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i would have expected you to be doing back flips down the hallway after such good news. you are so quiet.}
<A>__{todd does not respond.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{today, i think, i give you the day off from studying. how's that? how about one of my stories instead? i still have a few good ones saved up.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i don't care. whatever you want.}
<A>__{todd is wringing his hand together nervously under the table. dussander places a box of crackers on the table and goes back to the counter.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{let's see. i could tell you about the special soap we made. or there is always the story of how i escaped from berlin after i was foolish enough to go back. that was a close one, i promise you.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{anything, really.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{no, none of these i think. you don't seem to be in the mood.}
<A>__{dussander slices open a pack of velveeta and puts it on a plate.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{i think today i will tell you the story of an old man who was afraid. he was afraid of a certain young boy who was, in a queer way, his friend. the boy proved to be a very good student, but perhaps not in the way his mother or his teachers had envisioned. at first the old man disliked the boy intensely, but then he grew to... to enjoy the boy's company. of course, there was still a great deal of distrust between them.}
<A>__{he puts a glass of coke in front of todd and goes back to the counter. he opens a drawer, takes something out, closes it.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{each knew something that other wanted to keep secret. but over time, the old man began to feel that things were changing. he felt his hold on the boy slipping away from him.}
<A>__{dussander goes to the cellar door. his back is to todd. he opens the door and clicks on the light. todd stands up silently.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{so. one sleepless night the old man got out of bed and wrote down the story of his involvement with the boy. everything he could remember, from the first day forward.}
<A>__{todd has moved across the floor, careful not to let the floor creak under his steps. he is right upon dussander. dussander reaches out with one arm for a fresh bottle, grasping onto the railing with the other. his body hangs over the steep staircase.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{when he finished his hand was stinging from arthritis but he felt good for the first time in weeks. he felt safe.}
<A>__{he gets his balance again and turns to face todd. dussander holds the kitchen knife he was using earlier down at his side where todd can see it. a tense silence passes between them. todd is frozen. dussander steps past him and back into the kitchen. he closes the cellar door behind him.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{he climbed back into bed and slept until it was time for general hospital.}
<A>__{dussander sits back in his chair, cutting the seal on the fresh bottle.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{on the following day the old man put on his best suit and went down to one of the local banks and rented a safety deposit box. the bank officer explained to the old man that he would have a key and the bank would have a key. to open the box both keys would be needed. no one but the old man could use the old man's key without a signed, notarized letter of permission from the old man himself. with one exception.}
<A>__{todd sinks into a chair across from dussander and takes a sip of coke.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{that exception is made in the event of the box holder's death.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{then what?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{then the box is opened in the presence of a bank official and a representative of the internal revenue service. the contents of the box are inventoried. in this case they will find only a twelve page document. non taxable... but highly interesting.}
<A>__{todd understands what the old man has told him. he slams his glass down on the table and jumps out of his chair.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you can't... you can't do that.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{my boy, it is already done.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{but... christ! look at you. you could go at any time.}
<A>__{todd stares at dussander in disbelief. after a moment he storms out the back door to the porch.}
