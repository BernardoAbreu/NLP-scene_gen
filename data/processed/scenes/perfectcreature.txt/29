<L>__{int: jamestown slum, alleyway day}
<A>__{the alleyway is full of forensics personnel. lilly moves deeper into the alleyway. we see her pov moving forward, finally revealing the body of the young woman who is surrounded by various forensics staff. lilly talks to one.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{can i step in?}
<C>__{forensic guy}
<D>__{with the traffic. what's it matter.}
<A>__{lilly moves forward. she can now see the woman more clearly. the woman is obviously dead; her pale white skin like wet shining alabaster in the dark alley. flashes from photographic machines light the scene, almost blinding lilly and briefly revealing the true horror of the scene. lilly kneels and carefully begins to examine the body. another man now walks up and kneels next to lilly; young, good looking, obviously takes pride in himself.}
