<A>__{titles: 2:00 pm. forty five precious minutes have slipped away. mertz sits alone at olbricht's desk, lighting a fresh cigarette with the remains of another. the ashtray says he's been at this for quite a while. he stares at the clock, as if attempting to will time forward. his eyes sweep across olbricht's desk, past his files, his stationery, framed photographs of his family. then he looks up at a portrait of hitler. mertz is struck suddenly with a notion. he looks again at olbricht's desk. his stationery... "fuck it." he grabs the stationery and feeds it into a typewriter.}
