<L>__{interior the grim house day}
<A>__{mary is sitting, brooding in front of the tv, which displays only static white noise. she turns it off with the remote and sits in silence for a moment. she gets off the couch and moves to the kitchen table, where fay's computer sits. she goes over and reaches up above the fridge, opening the cabinet containing simon's notebooks. she hesitates, then takes them down and holds them in her hands, as if to begin reading. but then she puts them back. she walks over to the piano and stands there, hesitating, before slowly sitting down and opening it. she lifts her hands to play, then pauses and looks around behind her, making sure no one is there. but, finally, she turns back and begins playing. she plays a sad sounding modern classical piece with rusty accomplishment. at one time she was probably quite good. she plays for a while, gradually letting herself become moved by the music. but then she stops, pauses, and looks behind her. simon is standing in the kitchen. he has been deeply affected by her playing.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{please don't stop.}
<A>__{she stares him down a moment longer, then looks away and closes the piano. she returns to the couch and switches on the tv. simon comes closer. he sits.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{that was nice what you were playing.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yes, it was nice. but it was unremarkable.}
<A>__{simon waits. eventually...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{does that matter?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(looking right at him)}
<D>__{yes. it does.}
<A>__{she gets up off the couch and goes upstairs. she slams her bedroom door and leaves simon alone on the couch. he thinks. then, he gets up and goes into the kitchen. he takes the typed manuscript of his poem from the cabinet above the refrigerator and goes to the door. he pauses, clutches the poem and goes out.}
