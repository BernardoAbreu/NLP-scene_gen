<L>__{exterior rome wagon day}
<A>__{senator gracchus, an imposing, moral and corpulent man in his 60's, is riding in a luxurious wagon with senator gaius. and captain marcellus, the handsome head of the roman city guard. their wagon slowly maneuvers through the crowded streets of rome. the cosmopolitan bustle of the great urban center is everywhere around them.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{we have plague in the hebrew quarter and it is spreading... we have looting at the granaries... we have so much filth in the tiber that the water is undrinkable... we have praetorian guard units that are demanding protection payments from the merchants at the exchange }
<C>__{marcellus}
<D>__{my city guard units have tried to curtail these excesses but no constabulary can police the entire city. and the praetorians outnumber us two to one.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{rome dies as the emperor plays at beneficence. at least nero gave us music!}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{do you think he'll listen to us?}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{it is his duty to hear the will of the senate.}
<A>__{their wagon stops hopelessly stuck in a massive traffic jam of chariots, wagons and sedan chairs.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{not to mention the damn traffic!}
