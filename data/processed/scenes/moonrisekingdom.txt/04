<D>__{this is the island of new penzance. sixteen miles long. forested with old growth pine and maple. criss crossed by shallow tidal creeks. an important seabird habitat. there are no paved roads but instead many miles of intersecting foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry that runs twice daily from stone cove. the year is 1965. we are on the far edge of black beacon sound, famous for the ferocious and well documented storm which will strike from the east on the fifth of september in three day's time.}
