<L>__{interior hotel bar late night}
<A>__{on henry (the assistant cameraman who eli screamed at), his luggage beside him, his elbows, empties, loose change scattered before him on the bar top.}

<A>__{as the bartender is taking away the empties, henry puts his finger down on a dime.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{change is for you, except that. that's a very special dime.}
<P>__{(holds it up for cameron to see)}
<D>__{know what this is? ask me!}

<A>__{cameron pales, knowing that drunken henry's desire for revenge can expose him to the police. he grabs the dime from henry's fingers and drops it into a peanut vending machine.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what the hell you doin'?}
<A>__{cameron stuffs the bag of peanuts in henry's shirt pocket, grabs his suitcase and hustles him out of the bar toward the front door.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i'm putting you in a cab for your own good and sending you to the airport. he's mine, henry, all mine. just leave that son of a bitch to me!}
<A>__{they have reached the hotel doorway. by now, henry is convinced cameron means business. he stops.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{do whatever you wanna do, but i better do it with ya! you'll need help 'cause that goddamn looney is dangerous.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(blustering)}
<D>__{not to me, he ain't. i'm going to the cops. you gotta earn your living in pictures, but i don't give a shit. he can't hurt me.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{don't be too sure. damned psycho nearly strangled me! don't believe me? wanna see marks...?}
<P>__{(tears open shirt collar to show bruises)}
<D>__{...lucky to be alive!}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{henry, what are you talking about? i watched that whole thing today, he didn't even touch you.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{not today. when burt went into the water.}
<P>__{(cameron is wide eyed)}
<D>__{i could tell from up there in the chopper something' was wrong. so, i stopped shootin' and that crazy man gets me by the throat and starts screamin' to roll the film...i mean that guy's down there dying and he's screamin', "keep shooting! keep shooting!" then, he starts fighting me for the switch and it falls down...like a crazy house up there, with him thrashin' on the floor...he didn't care about burt. all he cared about was to get that man dyin' on film! sickest thing i ever seen!}
<A>__{as henry's last words sink in, cameron stands pale and shaken.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{i better grab that cab.}
<A>__{henry takes the suitcase from cameron's numb hand and pushes through the door, looks back for a parting shot.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{you tell 'em everything...don't mince words...}
<A>__{as he goes towards cab, some merrymakers push their way into the lobby.}
