<A>__{this one's gotta be pretty rough. george will know what to do. we finally see gage, but it should be clear to us that it's not really gage at all. some daemonic presence is riding inside the mouldering, disfigured shell of gage. there is a struggle. jud is repeatedly slashed with the scalpel. perhaps he gets gage a time or two with the pocketknife. gage screams and gibbers nothing intelligible here; only sounds. jud expires. gage sits on top of him...and then bites into his throat.}
