<L>__{interior honeymoon suite}
<A>__{the entire room is filled with swirling dust and smoke, completely obscuring everything from sight. as the sound of breaking furniture and grunting fighters echoes, a few pieces of debris bounce into view. and then there is silence. the dust settles and the smoke dissipates. the dream police stand alone in the rubble of a totally trashed room.}
<C>__{power cop}
<D>__{where'd he go?}
<C>__{sound cop}
<D>__{i thought you had him.}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{shit...}
<A>__{krueger has escaped.}
<B>__{hotel corridor}
<A>__{jacob runs, gina trailing behind him, the two of them trying to find a way out. they pass a door. the door slams open and freddy reaches out, grabs gina and yanks her into the room. the door bangs shut. jacob twirls around and runs towards the door. and the door disappears. nothing but flat wall remains as jacob hits it. he starts banging his fist against the side of the corridor.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no no no no!}
<A>__{the dream police run up next to him. jacob spins around angry.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{he's got gina!}
<C>__{sound cop}
<D>__{stand back.}
<A>__{everyone backs off. sound cop opens his mouth. boom! an almost visible sound wave bursts forth from his lips and crack, a huge hole is punched in the wall. the police leap into the hole, quickly followed by jacob.}
