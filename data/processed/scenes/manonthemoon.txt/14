<A>__{the club is empty. at the bar, the manager cleans up. andy eagerly comes over. offstage, his presence is soft, placid his voice barely above a whisper.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{so, mr. besserman, same slot tomorrow...?}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(awkward)}

<C>__{manager}
<D>__{look i don't wanna seem insulting. but... your act is like amateur hour: singalongs... puppets... playing records...}
<A>__{a stunned beat. andy is hurt.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{what do you want? "take my wife, please"??}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{sure! comedy! make jokes about the traffic. do impressions. maybe a little blue material...}

<D>__{i don't swear. i i don't do what everyone else does!}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{well, everyone else gets this place cookin'! pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "pop goes the weasel."}
<A>__{andy stares, disheartened.}
<C>__{manager }
<D>__{i'm sorry. you're finished here.}
<A>__{an uncomfortable beat and then andy starts crying. the manager is dumbfounded. he doesn't know what to do. tears are rolling pitifully down andy's cheeks. the manager is confused totally disoriented. shamed, andy covers his face, then runs out. silence. the manager stares after him... having no idea what just happened.}
