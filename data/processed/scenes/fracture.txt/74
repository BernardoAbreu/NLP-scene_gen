<L>__{interior marchand's office s.i.d. sunday afternoon}
<A>__{a mess of courtroom exhibits, copies of evidence, lists, depositions, photos, diagrams, take out food containers and coffee cups. marchand surveys it. the bleary end of a long day sifting clues, dead ends.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{willy. there's nothing here.}
<A>__{willy has barely slept all weekend. he shakes his head, reviewing the hotel surveillance tapes on a vcr tv, stubborn.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{guns don't just walk out of crime scenes.}
<A>__{marchand waves copies of crawford's evidence stills printed from home video dick took at a hostage negotiation: nunally doing his job, his methods, his routine.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{two months before he shot his wife, this guy had his investigator watching the cop at work. he knew exactly how it would go down and he didn't leave any loose ends.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{then what is this:}
<A>__{willy uses the remote. on the tv, in black and white: jennifer and nunally come out of their room and head for the pool indistinct figures zip jerkily in and out of rooms on fast forward until he slows it: crawford comes to let himself in.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{hotel surveillance. from that day. he was there. why?}
<A>__{marchand watches over willy's shoulder. shrugs.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{had to see it for himself.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{see what? they were out at the pool.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{the unmade bed. her panties. man's gonna shoot his wife in the head, he needs to get himself all worked up.}
<A>__{willy stares at the grainy black and white figure emerging from the room, walking away down the corridor. unconvinced:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{yeah. worked up.}
<A>__{marchand gets his jacket, pulls it on.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{willy, go home. tomorrow you go back into court and take your lumps then you start your cushy new life, and you forget all about this one.}
<P>__{(hoping to get a smile:)}
<D>__{and then you can lend me money and shit.}
<A>__{willy says nothing. runs the tape back and then slow motions it forward again. marchand goes out. leaving willy alone, watching crawford.}
