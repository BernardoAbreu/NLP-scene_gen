<L>__{interior cells night}
<A>__{a guard sits on a stool next to a heavy metal door. behind him, the captain of the guard beats a chained one eyed prisoner to a pulpy mess. there's a knock at the door.}
<D>__{guard #1 what is it?}
<C>__{muffled voice }
<D>__{need to see the captain.}
<A>__{the guard exhales, frustrated. he stands up, getting his keys out. he stops. opens the small eyehole to see into the other room. the lieutenant stares back at him.}
<D>__{guard #1 fine, fine.}
<A>__{he opens the door only to see conan standing there, holding the decapitated head of the lieutenant. the shocked guard goes for his sword. conan swings the lieutenant's head, smashing it into the guard's jaw and putting him down for the count. that's when the captain of the guard turns around. and we recognize him! he's lucius, the disfigured aquilionian who was one of khalar singh's lieutenants.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{men!}
<A>__{from around a corner come five more guards, drawing their weapons. lucius draws his as well.}
<C>__{lucius }
<D>__{you've made a huge mistake, ape. you'll never make it out of this place.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i came for you, lucius.}
<A>__{lucius nods to the guards, who advance on conan.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{you talk as though you know me, ape.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i do. and i am no ape. i am cimmerian.}
<A>__{as recognition crosses lucius' face, conan springs into action. he kicks the table at the men, sending the knives and other torture implements flying right into the first guard. the second guard tries leaping over the falling table. conan just grabs him in midair and throws him even faster into the iron bands of the prisoner cells. lucius lunges at conan, conan steps in on him, grabbing his sword hand. in a show of strength, he twists lucius' own sword until points down at the floor, then thrusts it through lucius' foot and deep into the wood floor below. lucius bellows in pain, pinned to the spot. the next three guards rush forward, forcing conan to deal with three weapons attacks at once. the first to strike swings a mace and chain that wraps around conan's sword and he tries to yank it free from conan's grip. instead, conan pulls him in a wide circle, sending him flying into a wall mounted torch. the guard burns like dry kindling. the second to strike hits conan on his sword hand, carving a deep gash and causing him to drop his sword. conan turns to face him, eyes filled with rage. the guard's face goes pale. conan head butts him with all his might and the guard goes down, bleeding from mouth, nose and ears. however, the last guard is upon conan before he can react. the powerful soldier uses the shaft of his poleax to lift conan off his feet and back against the far wall, pinned by the neck. conan struggles to breathe, the polearm shaft driving his throat into the wall. the thickness of the cimmerian's neck gives him time to reach into his bracer, pulling out a hidden knife which he buries into the guardsman's eye.}
