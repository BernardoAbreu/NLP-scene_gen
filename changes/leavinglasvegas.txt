<ACTION>__{It is the kind of bar where the well-to-do folks of LA go to pick up - or be picked up. Lesser-known actors, agents and executives of all ages. Into this bar comes Ben. Ben is in his thirties. He is wearing an Armani suit that could use a visit to the dry-cleaner's. He hasn't shaved in the last twenty-four hours (but neither has any of the actors in the bar). He is a good-looking man but is clearly in trouble of some kind. Although still in control of his faculties, it becomes clear in the following scene that he is much the worse for wear with drink. He looks around the room until he sees someone he recognizes and then walks over to a table where two couples are seated. The men are young execs, the girls, both blonde and busty, have very white teeth and smile all of the time. The camera follows Ben over to the table. One of the execs looks up as Ben gets close. He recognizes him but delays his recognition until the last moment in the hope that Ben is not looking at him.}

Music wafts across the soundtrack, almost drowned by the dense texture of thousands of slot machines, creating an insane New Age symphony. Credit sequence ends. Into the lobby from the street comes Sera. It's hard to tell how old Sera is - somewhere between twenty-five and thirty-five. She is a beautiful American girl. Her face has the freshness of a model in a Sears catalogue. She is dressed simply in a short black skirt and matching jacket. High heels complete the picture. Heads turn as she passes a group of businessmen and it's clear they find her very sexy. She acknowledges their glance with a half-smile and steps into the elevator. She could be a secretary, or a PA to one of the many execs here in Las Vegas at a convention. The body language is a bit different, though.}

There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car.
