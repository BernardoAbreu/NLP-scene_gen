<A>__{we've landed in hollywood, 1952. we're outside a teeny, grungy playhouse. the cracked marquee proclaims "'the casual company,' written and directed by edward d. wood, jr." pacing nervously in the rain is ed wood, 30, our hero. larger than life charismatic, confident, errol flynn style handsome, ed is a human magnet. he's a classically flawed optimist: sweet and well intentioned, yet doomed by his demons within. the doors open, and ed's pal john "bunny" breckinridge, 45, hurries out. bunny is a wealthy, theatrical fop wearing a string of pearls.}

<A>__{she hands ed her white shoes. he snatches one, grabs a pair of scissors, and starts cutting up the shoe. everyone is baffled. he keeps cutting the shoe... and it slowly takes on the shape of a dove! ed then grabs some pipe cleaners, works them into a shape, and sprints into the dressing room. he takes some green eye shadow and excitedly smears it on the pipe cleaners. ed then hurries back out, jams the green pipe cleaners into the cut up shoe... and it looks like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth! the cast is flabbergasted.}
