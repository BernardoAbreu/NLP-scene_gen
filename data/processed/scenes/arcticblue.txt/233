<A>__{mitchell and lemalle scatter under the hail of bullets.}
<B>__{angle on eric and corbett}
<A>__{as they hear lemalle's labored footsteps run past them, nearby. eric peers cautiously around the corner toward the depot. there is no further movement. eric waits a moment, then leads corbett cautiously toward the depot.}
<L>__{exterior rear wall of airstrip depot}
<A>__{reaching the rear wall, they practically stumble over something. it's mitchell, lying on the ground near the wall, badly wounded by eric's barrage. eric gasps. anguished, corbett kneels next to mitchell. mitchell pulls him closer.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{glad to see you're okay. i told lemalle not to shoot.}
<P>__{(tries to smile)}
<D>__{had some fine seasons, didn't we...}
<A>__{mitchell's grasp on corbett's coat relaxes as he dies. horrified, eric stares at the man he killed. noticing the scrimshaw lying on the snow where it slipped from mitchell's pocket, corbett picks it up.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(to eric)}
<D>__{fifteen years on the trail with this man, i never saw him rise to anger.}
<A>__{glaring at eric, corbett dips his hand in mitchell's blood, and suddenly smears it across eric's mouth. repelled, eric pulls back.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing; bitterly)}
<D>__{your first kill. how does it taste?}
<A>__{wiping his face, sickened and desolate, eric has no reply.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{then, from somewhere close by, lemalle fires at them. eric stuffs the .357 in his belt and uses a brick to knock the padlock off the back door of the depot. he pushes corbett inside.}
