<L>__{interior robinson's may day}
<A>__{... we stedicam into robison's may with them. we lose them for a moment behind racks of dresses and mannequins, but end up landing on jackie in her black suit, looking in a mirror and talking to amy on the designer clothes floor.}
<C>__{am}
<D>__{... you wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room...}
<A>__{we pan away and find louis and melanie by a dress rack, watching jackie.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{that's a nice outfit on her. i'm gonna go over and look at this michi moon display.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{just stay right fuckin' here, all right?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{are you sweating?}
<A>__{louis' hand immediately goes to his forehead and touches dampness.}
<C>__{melanie }
<D>__{job a little too much for you?}
<A>__{louis shoots melanie a hard convict look. melanie smiles at him, feeling the stare, but too much of a natural born smart ass to change.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i will be over here. you're too conspicuous.}
<A>__{louis looks over at the fitting room. jackie is going inside it, and the saleswoman is walking away towards him. he watches the saleswoman walk by him, then looks back in time to see melanie enter the fitting room.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{goddammit, not till i tell ya.}
<A>__{he decides he's watching the fitting room entrance too much, so he starts throwing his look around when he sees something that stops him cold.}
<B>__{max cherry}
<A>__{max is looking at dresses, paying no attention to the fitting room. he thinks, 'what the fuck is max cherry doing here?' max, doing what he's doing, looks up and sees louis staring at him across the floor. max smiles and gives louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues to do what he was doing. he quickly looks around the store to see anything else; any more surprise guests, possible police surveillance. everything looks normal. the saleswoman is behind the register ringing up jackie's purchase. the few customers there are doing customer stuff. then he sees melanie come out with a robinson's may bag and head down a different aisle. he hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. their whole fight is said tense and low.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what are you doin'?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i'm getting out of here. what do you think?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{lemme have the bag.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{fuck you. i can carry it.}
<A>__{she tries to push past him, and he catches her by her arm and pulls her around.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{goddam you. gimme that bag,}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{watch it, dipshit. you wanna rip the fuckin' bag?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{gimme that bag before i knock you out and take it.}
<A>__{melanie realizes louis ain't fuckin' kiddin'. not only that, this old guy looks close to buggin'. she lets go of the bag.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{okay, okay. take it. jesus, what's wrong with you?}
<A>__{he takes it. they start walking. we stedicam in front of them.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i'm carrying it.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{okay, you got it. just take a chill pill, for christ sake.}
<A>__{louis has had enough of her slang and says tensely through gritted teeth;}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{fuck you with your chill pill.}
<A>__{in mid walk, melanie asks him;}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{remember where we came in?}
<A>__{louis stops dead. he looks around, confused.}
<C>__{melanie }
<P>__{(like a teacher on romper room)}
<D>__{nooo, that's towards sears. we came in through bullocks. i know where it is. want to follow me, lou is?}
<A>__{pissed, he leaves frame. melanie, wearing her melanie smirk, follows behind.}
