<C>__{madeleine }
<D>__{ordinarily she would be repatriated to her country of origin. but because she is an orphan, she finds herself without a home. i'm pleased to announce that we have found a foster family in the united states. i want to thank janet wells for her assistance in making this happen. i believe this can stand as a signal that the international community in bosnia and beyond is finally ready to recognize the growing epidemic of sex trafficking, a human rights abuse as abhorrent as the war crimes that drew the international community to intervene in bosnia in the first place. thank you.}
