<L>__{exterior mountain, flat rocky area morning}
<A>__{a frog sits next to carl's glasses. it croaks. carl's hand smacks it like an alarm clock. the frog hops away. carl rises, looking up at the house.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{morning sweetheart.}
<A>__{the balloons on the house are wilting.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{we better get moving.}
<A>__{he scans the camp. the bird is gone.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{huh. bird's gone. maybe russell won't notice.}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{alright, everybody up!}
<A>__{russell sits up with a snort.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{where's kevin? he's wandered off! kevin! dug, find kevin!}
<A>__{dug crazily searches and sniffs, looking for the bird.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{find the bird. find the bird... point!}
<A>__{dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and "points" to the left.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{oh, look! there he is.}
<A>__{russell points to the right. the bird is on top of carl's house. dug turns around.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{point!}
<A>__{the bird has gathered a pile of food on carl's roof.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hey, that's my food! get off my roof!}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{yeah, get off of his !}
<A>__{in the distance, baby birds call out. the bird calls back.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what is it doing?}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{the bird is calling to her babies.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{her babies! kevin's a girl?}
<A>__{the bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{her house is over there in those twisty rocks.}
<A>__{miles off is a huge grouping of rocks; the labyrinth. the baby birds call from somewhere inside.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{she has been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them.}
<A>__{the bird "hugs" russell goodbye and pats carl on the head with her beak. she hisses at dug.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{wait, kevin's just leaving? but you promised to protect her!}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{her babies need her, we gotta make sure they're together.}
<A>__{the bird hurries off toward the labyrinth. carl gathers up the hose tether.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{sorry russell. we've lost enough time already.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{yeah...}
