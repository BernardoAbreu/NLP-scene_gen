<C>__{jane}
<D>__{well...}
<A>__{he interrupts her with the smallest of kisses so mall and swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid air. and then he does something he's thought about many times before he briefly caresses her breasts while continuing to look at her.}

<C>__{jane}
<D>__{three...i just thought of a third... if you talk about it, you don't have to do it.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{that's not it.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{good...another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.}
<A>__{she looks at him he's thinking.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{or it's that great feeling that you don't want to hold anything back. you know, intimacy.}
