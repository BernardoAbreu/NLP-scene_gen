<L>__{interior garage night}
<A>__{hockney, fenster, mcmanus and verbal are all laughing in a secluded garage. they are still in their black clothes from the robbery. hockney is throwing everyone a can of beer. keaton sits off by himself. he watches the others, unable to join in the festivities. the others sit around a cheap card table. it is covered with emeralds. dozens of them. everyone is in awe.}
<D>__{mcmanus there's more than i thought.}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{when does the fence come? mcmanus redfoot? he never comes to see me. i have to go see him.}
<C>__{verbal}

<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{hold the fuckin' phone. you and fenster? no, no, no. mcmanus guys, come on.}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{i'm sure you can understand my hesitation.}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{then who goes?}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{we all go. how about it, keaton?}
<A>__{all eyes turn to keaton. he comes out of his trance.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{we need to lay low for a while. mcmanus fine with me.}
<B>__{pause}
<A>__{everyone looks at each other, their moment of distrust blowing over. all eyes drift back to the emeralds on the table. hockney begins to snicker, then mcmanus, then fenster. verbal joins in at last. mcmanus grabs verbal and hugs him, shaking him violently.}
<P>__{mcmanus (cont'd)}
<D>__{my boy with the plan.}
<A>__{suddenly, everyone yells and pours beer over verbal's head. he laughs as he is drenched in white foam, nearly choking as the others chant his name. keaton watches from across the room, trying to smile in vain.}
