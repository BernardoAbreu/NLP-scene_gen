<A>__{first come the hatchlings, streaming right into their faces then veering away at the last second, repulsed by light. next come feral sounds overhead.}

<D>__{don't look.}
<A>__{thin blue liquid spatters them.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{do not look up.}
<A>__{more spattering. fry looks up and stumbles when she beholds... a ceiling of predators . at the cusp of light, they dive and weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to sound out the humans below. it's like looking into a bucket of angry eels.}

<D>__{keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going!}
<A>__{his voice whips them like the devil's coxswain. chastened, fry keeps her eyes down and speed up. more blue blood showers down followed by entrails dropping out of the sky. could this be hell itself?}

<D>__{"so dark the clouds around my way i cannot see, but through the darkness i believe god leadeth me. i gladly place my hand in his when all is dim, and, closing my weary eyes, lean hard on him...."}
<A>__{now whole corpses are crashing down around them, victims of in fighting. fry and imam start slaloming through the ghastly mess. pilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse: a blade slices his leg, drawing blood. he keeps his mouth shut.}
