<A>__{the door begins to close as the girls straighten up in the corridor and as chatterer ii turns around to come back out at them. he tries to put his hand out to stop the door closing, but succeeds only in trapping his fingers in the door. kirsty, as soon as the doors began to close, had hit the down button. now, she squeals with horror as she realises what is about to happen. the elevator begins to descend we can tell this because chatterer ii's fingers move down to the floor and are then sliced off. the girls run off down the corridor.}
