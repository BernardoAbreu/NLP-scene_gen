<L>__{interior kirk's apartment, terra night}
<A>__{kirk reads the novel, trying to focus. his flat befits an admiral and a loner with few possessions, except a collection of antiques.}
<B>__{we hear a soft bong.}
<A>__{startled, kirk lowers the book and pushes a button.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{come.}
<A>__{the door slides open and bones enters. he carries two packages, one of them wrapped in brown paper.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{'beware romulans bearing gifts.' happy birthday...}
<A>__{with a flourish, he pulls out a bottle of blue liquid.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{romulan ale! bones, you know this stuff is illegal }
<C>__{bones}
<P>__{(broad)}
<D>__{i only use it for medicinal purposes. don't be a pring...}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(reading the label with difficulty)}
<D>__{twenty two, eighty three...}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{takes the stuff a while to ferment. gimme.}
<A>__{he takes the bottle and pours; continues talking.}
<C>__{bones}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now open the other one.}
<A>__{kirk starts to obey.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i'm almost afraid to. what did you bring me, contraband klingon }
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{more antiques for your collection cheers!}
<A>__{they drink. the package is opened: a pair of gold "ben franklin" half glasses. (n.b.: romulan ale is an instant drunk: both men react.)}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{cheers. bones, these are... charming.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{four hundred years old. you don't find many with the lens still intact.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{uh what are they?}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{for your eyes. for most patients of your age, i generally administer retlax five to restore flexibility of the lens.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{but i'm allergic to retlax.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{exactly. happy birthday.}
<A>__{he toasts. kirk is unsure how they work.}
<C>__{bones}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{slide them down your nose. now look at me over the top. and you read printed matter through the bottom.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(reacts)}
<D>__{amazing! i don't know what to say }
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{say thank you.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{an awkward silence.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{damn it, jim, what the hell's the matter? other people have birthdays. why're we treating yours like a funeral?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{bones, i don't want to be lectured.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{what do you want? damn it, why isn't there a girl here? you know this has nothing to do with age. this is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping galaxies.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{spare me your notions of poetry, please. we all have our assigned duties and...}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{bull. you're hiding hiding behind the rules and regulations }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{and who am i hiding from?}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{from yourself, admiral.}
<A>__{pause. kirk pours another drink.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{don't mince words, bones; tell me what you really think.}
<C>__{bones}
<P>__{(mild take)}
<D>__{i'm your doctor and i'm your friend, jim. get back your command. get it back before you really do grow old. before you turn into part of this collection.}
<A>__{they look at each other.}
