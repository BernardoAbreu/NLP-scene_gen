<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{fellgiebel walks to the sink and dumps what is left of his drink in the basin. close on: mingling among the melting chunks of ice is a glass eye staring back at him. he scowls in the mirror at stauffenberg, waiting.}
<C>__{fellgiebel}
<D>__{you realize how close i am to hitler. with one word i could have the gestapo make you disappear.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{why haven't you then?}
<A>__{fellgiebel checks the stalls to make sure they are empty. stauffenberg collects his glass eye from the sink, dabbing it dry on a hand towel.}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{none of my associates know we've been talking if that's what you're afraid of.}
<C>__{fellgiebel}
<D>__{but you know. and when the ss catch you, they'll pull you apart like warm bread. it'll be a crime just to have known you then. i warn you. if it means protecting myself, i will expose you. do not try to contact me again.}
<A>__{fellgiebel heads for the door but stops on:}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{you can't report me. maybe if you had when i first approached you, you'd have been keeping your oath. but now you're just as guilty as }
<C>__{fellgiebel}
<D>__{so you think that makes me a sympathizer, eh? you give a man the choice of betraying a fellow officer or his fuhrer and assume his actions will show you his heart. it's not that simple.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{it is to me.}
<C>__{fellgiebel}
<D>__{for the last time, don't push me to make a decision.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i have no choice. it's clear now that without you we have no hope of success.}
<A>__{pause. fellgiebel's silence speaks volumes.}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{you want us to succeed. don't you?}
<C>__{fellgiebel}
<D>__{and what if you do, eh? what then? will you be any different from hitler? what of his reich, his people, the very momentum of history? will all of that let you be something he isn't?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{fellgiebel}
<D>__{there it is.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{but my pregnant wife, our four children, the germany i first swore to defend... they demand that i be something different. they demand that i fight for their future even if it means...}
<A>__{and for a moment his voice breaks and he chokes back what may be tears.}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{even if it means that i never see them again.}
<A>__{in that moment we see a side of stauffenberg we were starting to doubt existed. we see his humanity. this puts fellgiebel in his place. he adjusts his tie and we see the wedding ring on his finger.}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{action is inevitable. as are the consequences. when they come for me i will do what i can to hide what you knew and when you knew it.}
<P>__{(stepping closer now)}
<D>__{but don't delude yourself. you were involved in a crime against your country long before you met me. there's still time to redeem yourself. only god can judge you now.}
<A>__{bang. the door bursts open, startling them both. but it is only a drunken officer and a young woman looking for some privacy.}
<C>__{drunken officer}
<D>__{are you two finished or just getting started?}
<A>__{the woman laughs. stauffenberg walks out past them, leaving fellgiebel with hitler's finest.}
