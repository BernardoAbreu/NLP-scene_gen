<L>__{exterior favela day}
<A>__{cat leaps from one rooftop to another, shinnies down a drain pipe onto another roof.}
<B>__{angle on the gunmen}
<A>__{jumping down from the window of cat's home, start to sprint across the roof in hot pursuit.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she drops down to another roof, this one filled with a vegetable patch, where an old man is gardening.}
<L>__{exterior favela day}
<A>__{marco exits cat's house, wrapping his bloody hand tightly with a piece of his shirt.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{go! go!}
<A>__{he orders four more gunmen who have just zoomed up on motorcycles. the souped up rice rockets take off in four different directions.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{as she comes off the last rooftop, down into a small alley. she sprints across to a small door. she kicks at the door, which gives way and enters...}
<B>__{an open courtyard}
<A>__{where a half dozen women are doing laundry by an open tap. they look up to the sight of this little girl in the blood splattered school uniform, do not say a word. and neither does cat. she just runs through to a small gate on the far side of the courtyard, opens it, and disappears. one of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the gate, hiding it.}
<B>__{on the gunmen}
<A>__{they crash through the vegetable garden. the old man deftly kicks a rake leaning against the wall. it falls in between the rows of tomato vines. when the gunmen sprint through, the first one trips over the rake, goes crashing through the vines, which causes the two men behind him to also trip and fall. the fourth man hurdles his fallen cohorts, bounds over the roof. and the fifth man, looks at the old man. knows what he has done. shoots him dead before jumping off the roof.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she races down a steep hill in the crowded favela streets.}
<B>__{on the gunmen}
<A>__{they enter the laundry yard. the women don't even look up. the gunmen look around, just see laundry hanging from the fence, do not see the hidden door. race back out.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she runs down a steep alley, filled with people sitting outside their homes, chatting, playing dominoes. at the end of the alley, two motorcycles appear. the riders see cat, as she sees them. they turn their bikes into the alley... vrrooom! and bear down on cat. cat sprints back up the hill. she goes to escape into one of the open doors, but she finds that one after another the doors have closed shut, the people fled inside. the bikes eat up the hill. cat's legs are no match for them. it seems she will be caught any second. she ducks down a street where laundry is hung on a concealed metal pipe running the length of the alley. as cat ducks through the sheets the gunmen gun their bikes right towards her, tear through the sheets...}
<B>__{and the concealed metal pipe catches them across their throats. on cat}
<A>__{she looks back, to the dead gunmen, disappears over the hill.}
<B>__{and just as she does...}
<A>__{marco, in an open top jeep, with three of his gunmen on board, comes rolling up the road. he sees cat.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{there!}
<A>__{the jeep screeches around. cat dashes down an alley.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{as she runs up the alley with it's open sewers running on either side.}
<B>__{on marco}
<A>__{the alley is too narrow for the jeep. the men spill out, spring up the alley.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{alive!}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she runs up the alley, then ducks down another one. she comes to a ladder that leads up a fence, begins to climb.}
<B>__{on the gunmen}
<A>__{running up the alley, turning into the next one. where they see the ladder. one of the gunmen pulls out his cell phone.}
<B>__{on marco}
<A>__{in the jeep, scouting as it rolls along.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she is running for all she is worth, out of breath, scared.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{more thugs on bikes, on foot, in cars. they are everywhere.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she is leaning against a wall on a rooftop, gulping air, when she hears the roar of engines. looks over the side of the building to see dozens of gunmen flooding the area.}
<B>__{on gunmen}
<A>__{climbing the ladder.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{hearing them coming.}
<B>__{on gunmen}
<A>__{surrounding a building. throwing grappling hooks onto the roof ledge.}

<B>__{on gunmen}
<A>__{rappelling up the side of the building on the grappling ropes.}
<B>__{on gunmen}
<A>__{flooding onto the roof from both sides. coming to the spot where cat was only moments before. to find no cat. one of the gunmen takes out his cell. dials.}

<B>__{on gunmen}
<C>__{gunman}
<D>__{north!}
<A>__{the gunmen clear the roof. as the last one leaves, he takes one last suspicious sweep of the roof, cannot figure where this wisp of a girl went to. his eyes briefly focus on the chimney...}

<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{he clambers over the side of the roof.}
<B>__{the camera stays focused on the chimney.}
