<L>__{79 closer angle on tower night}
<A>__{as nina's arm raises into view with the middle finger extended.}
<C>__{nina }
<P>__{(hollering)}
<D>__{light this, eli!!!}
<L>__{exterior churchyard beneath the tower night}
<A>__{the church door swings open. nina and cameron emerge, covering their embarrassment with bravado. nina is prattling as though to a tour guide.}
<L>__{81 close on cameron and nina}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{...and those bells are so interesting. imagine four hundred years ago by boat from amsterdam. thank you for the tour. it was so informative. i'm going to write my father. he's so interested in god and things like that.}
<C>__{eli's voice}
<D>__{hiya. want a lift?}
<A>__{eli miraculously appears from above. he descends and rides around beside them in the bucket of the crane.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(ducking)}
<D>__{oh, for christ's sake...}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{there once was a maiden fair, smooching a guy with red hair...}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{eli, get away with that thing!}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{...could it be raymond who's turning this dame on? ...or his double, young lucky pierre?}
<A>__{unable to elude eli in his basket, nina turns on him in mock frustration.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{it's gotten to the point where i have to look under the stopper of the bathtub when i take a shower to make sure i've got some privacy!}
<P>__{(broadly gesturing to group)}
<D>__{thank you one and all and good night!}
<A>__{privately, she gives cameron's arm an affectionate squeeze, then disappears around the corner of the building. he is left holding the beach bag, pursued by the peter pan in the basket. it has now dropped to ground level so eli is looking up at cameron.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{step right in, folks...the "killer crane" ride of the century.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{thanks, i will walk.}
<A>__{eli's basket now moves up a few feet so he's looking down at cameron, riding beside him while he walks.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{ah, youth. six hours in town and caught with the leading lady. not bad. shouldn't be so upset.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{okay to be upset about what happened in the dining room? why'd you promise to show that cop the film? he'll recognize me.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you really don't trust me, do you? hop in. i got a present for you.}
<A>__{he pulls cameron into the basket beside him so unexpectedly that cameron drops sam's bag. eli picks it up and plops it into cameron's lap. suddenly cameron finds himself soaring skyward at a stomach churning rate while eli rattles on...probing, disarming, quixotic...}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{you constantly amaze me. you don't go to movies. what's that tatoo, a disguise? you a commie? don't you know that king kong was only three feet tall? he came up to fay wray's belly button. if god could only do the tricks we can. what are you worried about the film and the cop for?}
<A>__{now, hanging ten stories above the city, eli is adjusting his viewer, looking at a cluster of red flashing lights in the distance. he hands the viewer to cameron, who looks through it.}
