<L>__{interior helen's apartment night}
<A>__{andy answers the door. m.j. and ruben...}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{she just got to sleep. do you have to tell her about it now?}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{tell her about what ?}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(mock admiration)}
<D>__{gaahhd! what a cop ! you busted me!}
<P>__{(real)}
<D>__{the new one, in the marina.}
<P>__{(to their reaction)}
<D>__{she has a police radio scanner. it's always on. she turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again. she's obsessed. she can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it.}
<B>__{helen appears in whatever she sleeps in.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i am not going to look at any more pictures. they're like a disease. they get into my head. i can't get them out.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{i don't look at pictures. i look at the real thing . i don't feel infected.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{maybe that's why you can't catch him. i know what she looks like the red headed woman in my computer.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{i just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.}
<A>__{m.j. takes out a picture of the dead red headed woman. her manner is that of cop with a witness.}
<C>__{m.j. }
<D>__{a forgery of the mary sullivan murder scene, he's done it perfect. except for the sign.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(looking at photo)}
<D>__{she probably let him in the door without a thought. where are their mothers?! where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{look at the sign. 'hell'? in the festival of love? you make any sense in that?}
<A>__{helen stares at the picture.}
<C>__{m.j. }
<D>__{for 'hell', read 'helen'. he's talking to you.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it's anybody connected to author ity. they write, they even knock on your door. they're fans . it thrills them to flirt with getting caught.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on tv or the news... why would he want to get in your computer?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{because i'm his damned pin up girl! his, all of them! they know me. they're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, i'm their worthy opponent. you keep my name out of this.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{my promise.}
<A>__{andy, who has ducked out, now reappears, dressed for a date.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{the moon is up, my night to howl. will you be okay?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh, god, i forget. yes. yes. you go. poor thing, you ought to get out.}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(to m.j.)}
<D>__{look out for her. she's tougher than you think.}
<A>__{he goes...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i know 'halloran.' what's the rest of it?}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{maryjane. we call her m.j.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{maryjane. you think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night. i did once. but you know how he'll get caught? he'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky. you can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard. or the worst: there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month. the news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark. and then, one day, there are no more. what happened? did he just stop? get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? did he kill himself? did he die in an auto accident? or a fight. or get sick and die? it's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth. and you never know. but you keep asking yourself when you read about a new murder is he back?}
<A>__{m.j. stands. she has noted ruben's reaction to helen's story. there is an edge of sarcasm in her voice...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{that's amazing. a whole new book, thought up in a minute. very good.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{all i know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. hope, if he does another i will nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. where is andy going?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he's going home. he slept over because i was a little anxious...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{i want a guard on you. i'm worried about leaving you alone.}
<C>__{ruben}
<P>__{(to m.j.)}
<D>__{we're through for the night, aren't we? you go on. get some sleep. i will stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that would be much appreciated. thanks.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<P>__{(to helen)}
<D>__{somewhere down the line we're doing to find a connection between him and you. i want you to worry that idea like a loose tooth.}
<A>__{three voices chime self conscious 'good nights.'}
