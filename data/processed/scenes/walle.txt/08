<A>__{open racks for storing wall es line both walls. knickknacks of found junk littered everywhere. the tired robot removes his newfound treads. ahh... home. wall e motors down the center aisle. flicks on an ancient betamax player. jury rigged to an ipod. pushes in a cassette labeled, "hello dolly!" the image is very poor quality. actors sing and dance to put on your sunday clothes (poysc). the same song wall e worked to.}

<A>__{wall e opens his cooler. newfound knickknacks. pulls out the hubcap from his chest. looks back at the tv. mimics the dancers on the screen. pretends the hubcap is a hat. continues to unpack: a spork. a rubik's cube (unsolved). a zippo lighter. he presses a button by the rack of shelves. they rotate until an empty space appears. his new items are lovingly added to the shelf. the zippo joins a pre existing lighter collection. a new song, it only takes a moment, plays on the video. wall e is drawn to it. presses his "record" button.}
