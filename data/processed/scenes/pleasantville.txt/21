<A>__{david and jennifer are standing in the middle of the 1950's living room, dressed in bud and mary sue's clothing. they still clutch the remote control in the exact same position that was occupied by their fictional counterparts. david and jennifer glance at one another, then look horrified around the room. the world has turned to black and white...}

<C>__{voice }
<D>__{psst! over here.}
<B>__{different angle.}
<A>__{they whirl around to see dick van dyke's face smiling at them from the tv set in the comer. it's an old '50s set with a big round picture tube. they run over to him as he smiles. his face is the only color in the room.}
<C>__{dick van dyke}
<P>__{(beaming)}

<C>__{dick van dyke}
<D>__{a miracle.}
<A>__{they stare stunned at the tv set.}
<C>__{dick van dyke }
<D>__{... see, every time i thought i'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. they'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... they'd know all about muffin but they wouldn't know about bud ...}

<C>__{dick van dyke}
<D>__{well, you don't have to worry about that anymore.}
<A>__{full shot. television set. (color) all at once the scene on the tv changes and dick van dyke's picture gives way to a wide angle shot of the wagner house. mark davis is standing at the front door, banging on the brass knocker. he checks his watch, shifts restlessly for a moment or two, then turns and heads down the flagstone walk never looking back.}
<C>__{mark davis}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{... bitch.}
