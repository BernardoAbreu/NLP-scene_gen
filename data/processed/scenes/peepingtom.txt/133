<L>__{interior dark room night}
<A>__{the big drying drum is turning, feeding the dry print into a box. a small motor drives it. close shot of the box. mark is spooling up the film as it comes off the drier. once or twice he can't help glancing at an image. close up of vivian's face, in the image. mark stops the motor and the drum, loosens the end of the film, spools up with a snap, slides the spool off and hurries out with it. mark hurries to his projector, threads the film and starts the projector. he flicks it on, as if it were a gramophone, then looks eagerly at the 16mm screen. behind him something moves in the shadows reverse shot of mark. over the shoulder of someone who is standing deep in the shadows we see mark. his head obscures what he is watching on the screen. he turns round suddenly from mark's pov we see the processing sinks deep in shadow. he starts to move towards them, then suddenly stares at the shadows at the back of the room. silence except for the whirring of the 16mm projector. close shot of mark's hand switching on the light. mark turns round... he is as astonished at what he sees as he can be. camera pans in its own good time to the back of the room. mrs. stephens is standing in the shadows... a heavy hand rests on a heavy stick... the sightless eyes stare unerringly towards the light switch.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{good evening, mark...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{...how did you?}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{the young man bathing himself brought me to your door... i managed the rest of the adventure alone...}
<A>__{he stands motionless, staring at her standing motionless. above her head an ancient, half blind camera also stares at her. the only movement in the room is her smile.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{this is one room i expected to find locked.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i was never allowed a key..., can't get used to them.}
<A>__{mrs. stephens' sightless eyes stare at him.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i brought her home early.}
<A>__{close shot of her hand tightening on the heavy stick.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{thank you...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{is there something you...}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{... a talk.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{next door would be more...}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{i'm at home here... i visit this room every night.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{visit?}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{the blind always live in the rooms they live under...}
<A>__{mark nods.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{every night you pace for hours above my head! why?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i've no one to talk to... in the rooms i live over...}
<A>__{mrs. stephens nods. her hand touches the black cloth loading bag, lying on the table.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{i'm told that you stare too much... so do i.}
<A>__{close shot of her hand touching the black cloth bag. close shot of mark walking slowly towards her. at once she raises the heavy stick pointing it towards him. close shot of the stick. it is a shooting stick with a sharp spike on the end of it, similar to the tripod on mark's camera. mark stares at the stick, fascinated. close shot of mrs. stephens exploring the inside of the black cloth bag with her free hand.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{cloth... with something hard inside it...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's a changing bag... we put films in it so that the light won't spoil them...}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{how odd that the light can spoil anything...}
<A>__{the screen greys out. in mrs. stephens' own dark room we hear the hum of mark's projector and the pounding of mark's heart and, very faintly, the sounds of tony bathing himself.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{every night you switch on that film machine.}
<A>__{we hear his tiny intake of breath.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{what are these films you can't wait to look at?}
<A>__{the sound of his footsteps softly approaching. like a chair?}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{like a chair?}
<C>__{mrs. stephens }
<D>__{what is the film you're showing now?}
<A>__{very faintly we hear tony singing in his bath.}
