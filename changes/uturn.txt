<LOC>__{EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE DESERT SOUTHWEST - DAY}
<TRANS>__{BEGIN TITLES OVER:}
<ACTION>__{It is early morning and already hot.  INSECTS drone, crackle, and scurry for shade.  PRAIRIE DOGS burrow to escape the sun. We can see the heat shimmering off the surface of the Earth. On a dusty highway, a pair of VULTURES dine on a dead coyote. One of them snags an intestine and tugs a few feet of it out of the carcass. In the distance, where a long, dusty road meets the horizon, a small shape appears -- a Sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang convertible, its top down.  Its candy-apple red burns like a brilliant fireball under the sun.  As the car drifts closer, we see steam escaping from under the hood.  Sammi Smith's "Please Help Me Get Through The Night" plays on the car's radio.}
<LOC>__{INT. BOBBY COOPER'S MUSTANG - DAY}
<ACTION>__{At the wheel, ignoring impending disaster, BOBBY COOPER, young, good-looking, fiddles with the RADIO dial, annoyed only to find country stations. He's been driving since noon yesterday and it shows -- along with a heavily-bandaged left hand resting on the steering wheel. He finds something by Pearl Jam or Smashing Pumpkins and he cranks it. He pops a Percodan with his good hand as, in the shimmering distance ahead, he sees black shapes in the road and lays on the horn.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Get off the goddamn road!}
<LOC>__{EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY}
<ACTION>__{As the MUSTANG powers by, the VULTURES move off the shoulder, silently watching.}
<LOC>__{INT. MUSTANG - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The RADIO blares as BOBBY fights to stay awake. His attention is caught by blue and red lights flashing in the oncoming lane. He sits up as the POLICE CAR (SHERIFF POTTER inside) closes quickly. The SIREN starts faintly, then SCREAMS as the cruiser roars past at speed.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fuck you!}
<ACTION>__{There is a loud pop from the front of the Mustang and a thick cloud of steam now pours from the hood. The temperature gauge now starts rising.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No!...Not now!...Shit!}
<ACTION>__{A couple of SEMIS roar past in the opposite direction, buffetting the Mustang with their air waves.}
<LOC>__{EXT. FORK IN THE ROAD - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The car rolls into a fork in the road, limping with the droop of an animal that won't make another hundred yards. One sign on the larger road says "GLOBE" is 29 miles away. The other sign, on the lesser road, tells us "SUPERIOR" is only 2 miles. A third sign confirms his destiny with "Gas, Food, 1 Mile." BOBBY seems to have no choice. He aims the car down the lesser road towards "Superior, Arizona."}
<LOC>__{EXT. OUTSKIRTS SUPERIOR - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The car rattles on its last legs, as BOBBY mutters incantations, noticing a old, ghostlike MINING COMPANY at the base of the mountains overlooking the TOWN. It's deserted now, no one visible, the gates shut, but in its vast, dark bulk, we sense the ancient richness and power of this town. Bobby moves on.}
<LOC>__{EXT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Down the road from the MINING COMPANY, BOBBY'S CAR pulls into a small GAS STATION, made of weather-beaten wood, its windows long since dusted over. The pumps themselves look to have been manufactured in the early fifties. Above the station is a sign so faded it's barely readable: HARLIN'S. Bobby gets out of the car and with great care, favoring his bandaged left hand which seems to give him a great deal of pain, he opens the hood. A plume of steam hits him in the face.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh shit!}
<ACTION>__{Bobby looks around for someone, anyone.  After a few moments he reaches into the car and blows the horn.  He waits, then blows it again.  From out of the station walks DARRELL - a slow-looking man in coveralls caked with grease and dirty.  He looks the part of a yokel.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You Harlin?}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nope.  Darrell.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Harlin around?}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He's up at the Look Out.}
<ACTION>__{Darrell points a scraggly finger at a plateau in the distance.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Will he be back soon?}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You own this place?}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yep.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then why do you call it Harlin's?}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{'Cause Harlin used to own it.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But he's dead.}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So?}
<ACTION>__{Bobby is confused, but chooses to drop the matter.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...}
<ACTION>__{Darrell mops his brow with a greasy rag.  It doesn't so much wipe the sweat as it does streak his forehead with dirt.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Darrell--}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.}
<ACTION>__{Darrell is clearly upset at being cut off.  He leans into the car and looks at the engine.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So?}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, I can fix it.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Great!}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How much time?}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Time.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(rewinds his watch)}
<DIAL>__{What time is it now?}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Twenty-after-ten.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.}
<ACTION>__{Bobby wipes the bandaged hand across his forehead.}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What happened to your hand?}
<ACTION>__{Self-consciously Bobby quickly drops his hand to his side.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Accident.}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?}
<ACTION>__{Darrell slams down the hood.}
<CHAR>__{DARRELL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Just a car.}
<ACTION>__{Bobby reaches into the car, pulls out a small ugly gym bag which he slings onto his shoulder and moves to the trunk, pops it open.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not just a car. It's a sixty-four and half Mustang convertible. That's the difference between you and me, and why you live here and I'm just passing through.}
<ACTION>__{The trunk lid rises in the air, partially blocking Bobby from Darrell, acting as a partition between them.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now do you mind? I got to get some stuff out of the trunk.}
<ACTION>__{He throws the car key to Darrell who takes the hint, spits grotesquely into the dirt, scratches his nuts, and walks back to the shack. Concealed by the trunk lid, Bobby pulls out a GUN (a .9mm black Baretta), wrapped in a t-shirt, from the top of the bag. Perhaps we see a flash of green money, lots of it. Sports pages and betting sheets are piled inside. With a look around, Bobby takes the gun and stashes it underneath the rubber mat in the trunk. Briefly we notice a towing ROPE under the mat. There is a small travel bag, from which he peels a fresh bottle of Percodan, quickly taking two, as well as the sports page.}
<LOC>__{INT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{DARRELL watches out of the darkened office through the front window, as BOBBY slams the trunk and starts walking down the road, with the bag on his shoulder.}
<LOC>__{EXT. DESERT ROAD - LATER}
<ACTION>__{BOBBY walks along a dusty patch of road into town past a sign saying "SUPERIOR - HOME OF THE GOLDEN DOOR RETIREMENT COMMUNITY." As he walks on, a pair of MOTORCYCLERS roar past on their Harleys blanketing him in a cloud of DUST.  He shouts after them, but his words are lost under the whine of the cycle engines.}
<LOC>__{EXT. SUPERIOR MAIN STREET - DAY}
<ACTION>__{BOBBY hits town, such as it is:  The Freeway left here a few years back. There are only a few little stores:  A general store, a catalog outlet, a post office that doubles as a bus depot.  All of them built for the desert heat. The busiest spot in town seems to be the truckstop/diner with a few 18 wheelers parked outside it. At the corner of one street sits an old BLIND MAN dressed in raggedy clothes, perhaps an Indian. His SEEING-EYE DOG lies next to him. He's talking to TWO OLD MEN, veterans perhaps, Indian or Spanish. They both have missing limbs and slide off with furtive alcoholic looks as Bobby passes. The Blind Man yells out in an American Indian accent.}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey!  You there!}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You want something, old man?}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You want something?}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You can't do that yourself?}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry, I didn't--}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Christ no!}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I said I was sorry.}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, sure.  You got change?}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{All right, old man.  Christ.}
<ACTION>__{Bobby walks across the street to a very old soda machine; it has bottles instead of cans.  The blind man shouts to Bobby.}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Colas. Colas ain't nothing but flavored water.}
<ACTION>__{Bobby puts change in the machine and pulls out a bottle of Dr. Pepper.  He starts back to the blind man.}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Christ!}
<ACTION>__{Bobby goes back to the machine and opens the bottle, then walks back to the old man who pours a splash on the ground.}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A little for Mother Earth. I'm about fifty percent Indian, you know. To all our relations.}
<ACTION>__{He takes a hearty swig of the soda.}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ah!  Just what I needed!  Want some?}
<ACTION>__{The blind man holds the bottle out to Bobby.  A string of saliva runs from his lips to the bottle's neck.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll pass.}
<ACTION>__{Bobby reaches down and pets the old man's dog. Flies buzz around both the dog and the Blind Man.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's 'cause he's dead.}
<ACTION>__{Bobby jumps back.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, Jesus.}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hell no!}
<CHAR>__{BLIND MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(as Bobby moves away) I'll see ya later,}
<DIAL>__{unless I come across something worse.}
<ACTION>__{Bobby noticing a beautiful woman down the street, GRACE McKENNA, compulsively turns and catches up to her.  She is dressed better than the usual t-shirts and tank tops of this town -- perhaps a mail-ordered dress or a mother's hand-me-down.  With her raven hair and caramel skin, it is obvious she is Native American. Her arms are full with an awkward package she can barely manage.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can I give you a hand, beautiful?}
<CHAR>__{GRACE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Do you have to call me that?}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't know your real name.}
<CHAR>__{GRACE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maybe I don't want you to.}
<ACTION>__{Grace stops walking.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.}
<CHAR>__{GRACE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{It's Grace.}

<DIAL>__{Wasn't nothing.}
<CHAR>__{GRACE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's all right.  I got it.}
<ACTION>__{Bobby takes up the package and they begin walking again.  The package seems to have gained weight.}

<DIAL>__{And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.}
<ACTION>__{Grace steps to Bobby and places her hand against his chest.  She rubs away some of the sweat. They look at each other a beat. A POLICE CAR, seen earlier, pulls up beside them from behind and idles. SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER is a weathered, handsome, middle-aged man with suspicious eyes, black haired in contrast to Bobby's sandiness.}

<ACTION>__{They lift the corpse, and with great effort, haul it towards the edge of the drop. As they pause on the way, Bobby, wary of Grace's strange coldness, tries to soften the blow of separation.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look, it's not so bad we split up. It might be months before they find these guys. If at all. I mean with the mountain lions around here. Remember, if they can't find no bodies, there's no crime... (She doesn't respond.) We'll be in Phoenix by noon. Lose this car, get another one. Texas, Mexico are big countries, all that money Grace, you'll meet someone else, you know, there's a lot of hope with a $100,000...}
<ACTION>__{They lift Jake again, and move to the edge.}
<CHAR>__{GRACE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hope is a four-letter word.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But we all need that too. Hold him.}
<ACTION>__{He props Jake at the edge, standing, and transfers the weight onto Grace. Jake's head is on her shoulder.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You make a pretty couple.}
<ACTION>__{It seems he might push them both over but instead takes the gun, wipes it of his prints, and slips it through Jake's belt.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Won this in a poker game in Reno. God knows who it's registered to.  You shoulda been more careful, Jake. See you later.}
<ACTION>__{As he takes Jake's weight off Grace and pushes it over the drop. Grace watches him go, her eyes shifting to Bobby, his back momentarily to her, also watching. She moves towards him. Bobby turns, slips on the edge.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now all we got to do is try and --}
<ACTION>__{He feels a blur of motion, almost like a bird, and he is falling...falling, his life coming to an end. Grace is standing somewhere up above, briefly seen. Did she push him? He doesn't know. He's stunned as he falls on the rocks next to the bodies of Jake and Virgil. He screams out in sharp pain. His leg feels broken. But he is alive. Grace walks away, cutting it all off, deeply shaken. She must get away from the past and all these hollow men. She closes the trunk of the Mustang, gets in the driver's seat, reaches for the ignition key. Her hand fumbles for it a moment. It isn't there.}
<CHAR>__{GRACE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shit!}
<ACTION>__{She sits there. Bobby is calling from below.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Grace! Help me, Grace...! We been through too much together.  We've only had one day, but you and me have been through more than most people ever will. I know you were angry at me, and, you know, you were right! I'm sorry I hit you. I was wrong about leaving you. You don't belong in Mexico.}
<ACTION>__{She finally gets out and walks back to the edge of the cliff, looks down.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.}
<CHAR>__{GRACE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Bobby? Are you all right?}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I busted my leg!}
<CHAR>__{GRACE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can you make it back up?}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.}
<ACTION>__{She looks. Of course the trunk is closed. She closed it.}
<CHAR>__{GRACE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Bobby, the trunk...it's locked. Throw the keys up to me. I'll get the rope.}
<ACTION>__{Bobby's eyes pass over Jake a few feet away, his eyes staring upwards in death. They take in the gun still attached to his waist. He knows the trunk wasn't locked when they took Jake out.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I can't throw that far. You got to climb down here and get the keys. You can make it. It's the only way Grace.}
<ACTION>__{Grace looks down at the drop.  It's a tough descent but she knows she could make it and get back up as well.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Grace!...Please, Grace!  You have to help me.}
<ACTION>__{Grace takes a look around.}
<CHAR>__{GRACE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay. I'm coming. Calm down!}
<ACTION>__{She starts down the cliff face. As she descends, he talks deliriously.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(off)}
<DIAL>__{I knew you'd help me. I knew you wouldn't leave me baby, cause we're tied together too close. We belong together always.}
<ACTION>__{Grace makes it to the bottom of the drop, and walks cautiously towards Bobby.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{GRACE (yelling back, echoing)}
<DIAL>__{Bobby! Don't flip out on me. I can't do this alone. I know you don't trust me, but you gotta pull yourself together, I'm not gonna leave you...I never wanted it to go down like this. It was different with you Bobby. You had dreams like me. You listened... I would've gone anywhere with you, Bobby. We can make this work. I'm sorry...I really am. I didn't wanna hurt you.}
<ACTION>__{Can he believe her? She sounds so sincere this time. She's heading for the body of Jake. And the gun. Bobby knows that and is already crawling there.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(as he crawls)}
<DIAL>__{They're right here, Grace.  The keys.  Come get me out of here... Know why else I could never leave you?}
<CHAR>__{GRACE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why's that?}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{'Cause I love you.}
<ACTION>__{Inching closer. Closer. They meet at the apex of Jake's corpse.}
<CHAR>__{GRACE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And I love you too.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...}
<ACTION>__{Grace leans close to Bobby.  He dangles the keys out in front of her, but she doesn't reach for them. Her eyes go to Bobby. She reaches for him. At that instant Bobby's hands shoot out and clamp hard around her.  A sharp gurgle is all that escapes Grace as Bobby twists the life from her, as Jake leers up at them.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{... or kill you .}
<ACTION>__{Grace twists and flails in Bobby's hands, but in spite of his bleeding stump, he holds her like a bear trap holds a grizzly.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I love you Grace, but I just can't trust you !}
<ACTION>__{She looks at him, trying to protest, shaking her head. Grace's flailing goes into overdrive. Somewhere in his semi-delirious state, Bobby's eyes might notice the gun at Jake's waist is no longer there. Grace manages one word:}
<CHAR>__{GRACE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jake ...}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He can't help you now, honey!}
<ACTION>__{Bobby is in agony as he kills her, part beast, part lover, he kills that which he loves. Suddenly, a SHOT is heard. Bobby buckles with the blast, hit in the side. He kills her with one last wrenching thrust of his hands, breaking her neck. Bobby looks down at Jake's gun, which she clutches in her hand, and sees the hole in his side and the river of blood that flows from it.  He manages to stand, looks at Jake; their bodies lying side by side. Bobby, with great difficulty, claws his way back up the rocks to the car, his fast-flowing wound staining the white rocks with blood. He makes it to the top and, losing more blood, climbs into the driver's seat. He checks the money in the bag. All there. All his. As he pulls a huge clot of blood from his side, the vultures circle. Perhaps one, smarter than the others, lands close by. It spooks Bobby but he's okay. He looks in the mirror.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're still lucky.}
<ACTION>__{He puts the key in the ignition, the engine comes to life.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(waves back)}
<DIAL>__{Adios --}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly, the RADIATOR HOSE Darrell installed blows apart loudly. Bobby knows exactly and immediately what it is as a cloud of steam now rolls from under his hood. He shakes his head, frustrated.}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(sighs)}
<DIAL>__{Oh shit!...(then) Arizona.}
<ACTION>__{He can't help but laugh at his bad luck. As we rise off the desert floor and take flight with the vultures, eventually leaving them all as specks of earth in the vast empty canyons of Arizona.}
