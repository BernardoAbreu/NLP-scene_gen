<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you don't fight fair.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i've seen where that gets me! i'm sick of the whole notion of the enduring female. grow up! cause while you're going through your fifth puberty, the world is falling apart and your kid can't handle it!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{our kid is just trying to deal with this goddamn madhouse you've dragged her into.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{this madhouse is my home.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{think about that statement for a second, why don't you?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{jean is here with me because this is a family event.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{jean's here with you because she's a buffer between you and the shrill insanity of your mother.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{y'know, you'd have a lot more credibility if you had any credibility.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you can't resist, can you?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you're a pretty easy mark.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you're so goddamn self righteous, you know? you're so }

<D>__{surely you must've known when you started porking pippi longstocking you were due for a little self righteousness, just a smidge of indignation on my part }
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{maybe i split because of it. they've reached the back porch stairs. she turns on him.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{is this your confession, then, when you finally unload all?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you're thoughtful, barbara, but you're not open. you're passionate, but you're hard. you're a good, decent, funny, wonderful woman, and i love you, but you're a pain in the ass. bill pushes past her up the stairs, disappears inside.}
