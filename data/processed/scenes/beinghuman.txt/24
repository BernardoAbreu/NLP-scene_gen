<L>__{interior house day}
<A>__{at home, we find lucinnius and hector with the diviner hermas. they are gathered around a shrine in the large public room. the entrails of a chicken lie on a slab of marble. hermas prods them with a knife. he makes much of the mysteries of his craft, as if it were a skill beyond ordinary men. the other two peer over his shoulders. suitably mysti fied, lucinnius talks in a reverent low voice.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{are my ships from sicily still afloat...?}
<A>__{hermas tetchily stops him.}
<C>__{hermas}
<D>__{no, no... offer the grain first... sprinkle it on the altar...}
<A>__{lucinnius obeys.}
<C>__{hermas}
<D>__{... and we can't ask the gods specific questions like that... it's a gentle, probing enquiry... general questions... but let's see.}
<A>__{he cuts into the chicken liver and prods around the in side. the other two wait in silence.}
<C>__{hermas}
<D>__{general answer... no...}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{hermas}
<D>__{i mean, no. the liver says no...}
<A>__{lucinnius objects.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{do it again... i want you to do it again... is it the gods' will... that cyprian... be well disposed towards me... in the future?}
<C>__{hermas}
<D>__{if you want to do it again, you need another chicken and another fifteen sesterces... and i'd like the first fifteen now please.}
<A>__{hector looks a lucinnius, who nods reluctantly. hector opens his purse and counts out the coins for hermas.}
