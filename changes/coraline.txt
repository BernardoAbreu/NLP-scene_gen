<ACTION>__{Written by Henry Selick Based on the novel by Neil Gaiman HEAD CREDIT SEQUENCE MYSTERIOUS SEWING ROOM - NIGHT, A HAUNTING LULLABY plays against a black, star-pricked sky when something appears in the distance. A BUTTON-EYED DOLL floats towards CAMERA, through the open window of a small sewing room where it lands in a pair of WAITING HANDS, hands that are made of SEWING NEEDLES. The doll - which resembles a YOUNG BLACK GIRL in old- fashioned clothes, hair fixed with ribbons and braids - is placed on a sewing table. An elaborate sewing kit is opened, and, in flickering green light, the NEEDLE-HANDS go to work. The doll's old clothes are cut away; button- eyes torn off; hair pulled out. The doll's stuffing is removed and then the empty cloth body is pulled inside out, turning from NUT BROWN to PALE PINK. Sawdust is poured in the NEW DOLL's mouth; facial features added; blue yarn hair punched in; and then a fresh pair of shiny black button eyes is selected from a button drawer. The transformed doll, in a LITTLE YELLOW RAINCOAT, its new button eyes affixed, is released out the window and}

A MANGY BLACK CAT walks right in front of the lens and looks at us with concern. OFF-SCREEN, a door bangs open.

Coraline - breathing hard - removes the key and string from around her sore neck. She pulls up the corners of her blanket - with the needles on it - around the rock, and ties it all together with the string. The key is left attached. The two friends carry the heavy package to the well and DROP IT DOWN THE HOLE. By the light of a stray moonbeam, they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in the dark water at the bottom. They slide the well cover in place. Still catching his breath, Wybie stands, holding his injured hand, its glove ripped by the Beldam's claw.
