<L>__{exterior highway day}
<A>__{a merciless sun beats down on a long stretch of highway. the black tar from the road melting slightly. no sign of maurice. we see into the distance, not a soul in sight. we look to a hillside a hundred meters from the road. there we see a figure lying still in the shade of an overhanging rock formation. maurice has a towel over his eyes and his feet propped up on his shoulder bag. he is fast asleep.}
