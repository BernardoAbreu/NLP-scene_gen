<A>__{an old guy with a staccato voice delivers a monologue:}
<D>__{voice over there used to be a staff of fifty in this place. i'm the only one left from those days. it all comes down to one sap: the night shift bellhop, that's me. what the hell is a bellhop? you know where the name comes from?}
<P>__{(silence)}
<D>__{of course not... it's so simple it's stupid. they ring a bell and you hop. you hop to front and center. no heroes in this line, kid. just men doing a job. no questions asked, none answered. i try to keep it simple, kid, not too personal...}

<D>__{you met any of those old stars?}
<C>__{the old guy}
<D>__{stars! are you kidding me? i took rin tin tin out for a shit, for christ's sakes. i taught shirley temple how to roller skate. i saw fatty arbuckle regurgitate three cheese sandwiches right on the spot you're sitting, kid. what did you say your name was?}

<D>__{ted.}
<C>__{the old guy}
<D>__{ted, right. i remember marilyn used to come down at night and doze off in the kitchen. she liked the sound of the fans out back spinning around. sure, these were stars, kid. errol flynn used to call me "alibi." you'll pick up a few stories yourself, kid.}

<D>__{i don't think so, not like yours.}

<C>__{ted}
<D>__{beats me.}
<C>__{the old guy}
<D>__{he pulls his pants down and takes a crap just like you and me. take my word for it.}
<A>__{a wisp of smoke passes over a napkin pinned to the wall with a lip print on it signed "marilyn." the camera pulls back to reveal ted and the old guy sitting on a foldout cot in a small back room of the hotel mon signor. the old man is dressed in a striped t shirt with a bellhop's cap on. he looks like an old pirate. next to him on the bed sits ted, a young guy with a bellhop jacket draped over his knees. the old bellhop takes a long drag off a big cigar.}

<D>__{camacho!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{the old guy}
<D>__{the cigar. cuban. a good cigar, wrapped in miami. i get a box of them every christmas from the chairman of the board. i think he sends them to me to keep my mouth shut. it's tough not to get a little personal in this business.}
