<L>__{exterior fence night}
<A>__{claude runs up and grabs ray's legs, pulling for all he's worth. the shirt rips free, sending ray and claude tumbling to the ground. they leap to their feet and turn toward the car running smack into the barrel of dillard's shotgun.}
<L>__{exterior superintendent's mansion day}
<A>__{an old black prisoner delivers a frosty mint julep to superintendent abernathy who rocks slowly in his chair. at his feet, his 10 year old daughter mae rose is playing jacks. her long blonde hair makes her look like a little angel.}
<C>__{mae rose}
<D>__{look, daddy. they caught those two men who escaped last night.}
<A>__{mae rose is pointing down the drive, where dillard and a couple of trusties march ray and claude toward the house.}

<D>__{they ain't men, mae rose. they're convicts. and nigger convicts to boot. can you say nigger?}

<C>__{abernathy}
<D>__{no, nigger.}
<C>__{mae rose}
<D>__{nigger.}
<C>__{abernathy}
<D>__{that's my girl.}
<A>__{bound by leg irons and handcuffs, ray and claude are deposited at the bottom of the stairs.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{here they are, superintendent. we tracked 'em all the way to the tallahachie.}
<C>__{abernathy}
<D>__{that's quite a ways. i'm glad you new york boys could see some of our lovely countryside while you're down here. what do you say, mae rose? how should we teach these two a lesson?}
<A>__{mae rose considers their faces. ray and claude look like they've been to hell and back.}
<C>__{mae rose}
<D>__{a night in the hole?}
<C>__{abernathy}
<D>__{better make it a week.}
<A>__{dillard nods and turns ray and claude around. as they march back down the drive, abernathy takes sip of his mint julep and affectionately pats mae rose on the head.}
