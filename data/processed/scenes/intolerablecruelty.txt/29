<C>__{miles}
<D>__{for the first time in my life, i stand before you naked... vulnerable... and in love. love. a word matrimonial lawyers shy away from. ironic isn't it that i have been frightened of this emotion which is, in a sense, the seed of my livelihood. but today, i am here to tell you: love should cause us no fear. love should cause us no shame. love... is good.}
<P>__{(he lets it sink in)}
<D>__{let me ask you a question. when our clients come to us confused, angry, hurting because their flame of love is fluttering and threatens to die should we seek to extinguish that flame, so that we can sift through the smoldering wreckage for our paltry reward? or should we seek to fan this precious flame this most precious flame back to loving, roaring life?}

<D>__{extinguish?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{should we counsel fear or trust? should we seek to destroy or to build? should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism or with love?}

<P>__{(another raised hand)}
<D>__{kramer?}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{build?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{the decision of course, is each of ours. for my part, i have made the leap of love, and there is no going back }
