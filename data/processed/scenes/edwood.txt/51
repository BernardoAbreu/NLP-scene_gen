<L>__{exterior street early morning}
<A>__{we are on location for ed's first film! a small crew of a dozen unpacks the camera and reflectors from their cars. ed's voice rises above the hubbub.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{excuse me, could i have everyone's attention?! could you gather around? i've got something to say.}
<A>__{the crew members put down their things and gather in a circle. in the middle, we reveal ed, in complete drag. dress, nylons, pumps, lovely blonde wig... he's quite a sight. like an eager scoutmaster, he addresses his troops.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{everybody, we're about to embark on quite a journey. four days of hard work... but when it's over, we'll have a picture that'll entertain, enlighten, and maybe even move millions of people.}
<A>__{a couple grips glance at each other.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{now the only way we're gonna achieve all this is if we stay on schedule. day one today we'll start easy. we have eighteen silent scenes that can be shot quickly: cars parking, patrick's suicide, me strolling as a man, me strolling as a woman, etc.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{after lunch, we'll bring in the inspector and the doctor. the doctor is very important to the plot, so we might have to spend time on retakes. but it's worth it. scene totals for the first day is thirty four.}
<P>__{(he catches a breath)}
<D>__{day two, we'll be a little busier }
<A>__{veteran cameraman bill, an old guy with thick glasses, speaks.}
<C>__{cameraman bill}
<D>__{excuse me eddie, i don't mean to interrupt... but i'm gettin' a little worried about those clouds.}
<A>__{he points up. everybody looks at the sky. the clouds are gray. ed nods in agreement.}
<D>__{ed good thinkin' . we'll talk about days three and four later. now let's get that first shot off! it's scene 17, glenda looking in the window.}
<B>__{the crew}
<A>__{disperses. ed quickly runs in his heels over to the burly make up man, harry.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{okay, do i need any touch up? make up man harry i'm telling ya, eyelashes are the way to go.}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{harry, we've discussed this a million times. i don't want to look like a girl. i want to look like myself. make up man marry}
<P>__{(disgruntled)}
<D>__{fine. then you look beautiful .}
<A>__{harry humorlessly powders ed's nose. ed turns away and suddenly shouts into a giant megaphone.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{places, everyone! roll camera!}
<C>__{cameraman bill}
<P>__{(nonchalant)}
<D>__{rolling.}
<B>__{wide}
<A>__{ed chucks the megaphone and runs crazily past the camera and behind a building.}
<C>__{ed's voice}
<D>__{and action!}
<A>__{a pause, and then ed, in character as glenda , calm and dignified, steps out and walks down the sidewalk. ed stops at a store window. he's totally in shadow. a grip grimaces. he turns on a light ed lights up. he looks in the window, admires a dress on display, then silently walks out of frame. a beat. ed screams.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{and, cut! print it! let's move on!}
<C>__{cameraman bill}
<D>__{don't you want a second take, for protection?}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(exhilarated)}
<D>__{what's to protect? it was perfect!}
<A>__{suddenly a police car turns the corner.}
<C>__{crew member}
<D>__{cops!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{we don't have a permit. run!}
<A>__{everyone grabs equipment and takes off.}
