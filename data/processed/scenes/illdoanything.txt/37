<L>__{exterior theater night}
<A>__{cathy and matt are leaning against burke's car. cathy is distraught temporarily, but horribly, unsure of herself. matt is looking at her. if he had a little more confidence going for him right now, he would make his move. but, for now, they are two self doubters on different trips.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i never thought it would do this well. there were so many holes; i told everybody it wasn't going to do business. why am i so public with my opinions?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you might be right.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{not with that score. you know, maybe tonight's the night i'm losing my entire mind, but weren't you in 'platoon?'}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{incredible. i was only there for a minute in the rape scene, moving past charlie sheen when i left the hut... i had a great scene cut out... i was...}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{but there was that one long close up where you seemed ashamed of yourself but still arrogant.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{that's exactly what i was going for.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{it reminded me of my last boyfriend.}
<P>__{(indicating book bag)}
<D>__{got to go.}
<A>__{she hefts the bag puts it back down crosses her eyes, burlesquing the weight of the bag. he helps her put it on her shoulder.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you have to read all that?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{beast of burden.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(sincerely)}
<D>__{so what are you, totally wonderful or what?}
<A>__{she smiles and is gone, staggering a bit under the weight of her scripts. matt looks after her. burke and nan approach.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{how come you haven't said anything? this is great, right?}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{what no?}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{the definite recommends are way off for a score this high and, even for action adventure, it's just too low for women.}
<P>__{(burke looks anguished)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{he leans against the car for support.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{it was such a good score.}
<C>__{nan}
<P>__{(extraordinarily sympathetic)}
<D>__{i know... and, unfortunately, yesterday's tracking wasn't...}
<P>__{(he reacts)}
<D>__{i'm sorry... they just don't seem in the mood for action adventure right...}
<P>__{(he reacts)}
<D>__{sorry... may i tell you one more thing?}
<P>__{(he looks up in anticipatory fear)}
<D>__{i think it's so wonderful that you don't worry about even trying to act strong.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{thanks. you want to eat something sometime?}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{i'm, uh... i'm blushing from head to foot.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{good. i will call you.}
<A>__{as burke moves to his car. he sees the group captain paying matt.}
<C>__{group captain}
<D>__{thirty two, thirty three.}
<A>__{burke is looking at matt with some surprise.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you want to do this regularly for me? i was gonna offer, but i thought it would humiliate you.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(straight at him)}
<D>__{i don't mind an occasional odd job. but i can't work tomorrow. i have to get my kid.}
<A>__{as they get in the car, burke has the front door open, about to get in reconsiders, and gets in the rear door.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{okay, i got the cards to look at i think i will ride back here.}
<P>__{(to nan)}
<D>__{maybe i will drop by your place tomorrow.}
<A>__{matt gets behind the wheel, thereby ending the day as a full fledged chauffeur. they drive off.}
