<A>__{perry nods. truman waits for more. it doesn't come.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{we're not so different as you might think. i was abandoned repeatedly as a child. my mama'd drag me along to some new town so she could take up with another man she'd met. night after night she'd lock me in the hotel room mama'd turn the latch and tell the staff not to let me out no matter what. i was terrified i'd scream my head off till finally i'd collapse on the carpet next to the door and fall asleep. after years of this she just left me with relatives in alabama.}
<C>__{perry}

<A>__{truman's laughs, surprised by the joke, though it's unclear whether perry meant it as one. he stares at perry.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{what i can't decide is if you understand how fascinating you are.}
<A>__{perry doesn't respond, then }
<C>__{perry}
<D>__{i'm sorry about your tie. they took it away from me because we're all on suicide watch. it's why the lights stay on at night.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i hope we're past that now. you had me worried.}
<C>__{perry}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i don't care about the tie. it's just a pity because it looked so good on you.}
