<L>__{interior greek restaurant night}
<A>__{a woman smashes a plate over a man's head. it's plate smashing party time, greek style. twenty drunk people having fun. zorba music. plates are thrown, stamped on, smashed. jack sits alone at a corner table, drinking, watching the fun, unsmiling. one plate cracks into a wall behind him. a man stumbles backwards into jack's table. jack swiftly moves his drink out of the way. the man apologises, turns to jack. it is matt.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{jacko! how're you doing?}
<P>__{(shakes jack's hand vigorously)}
<D>__{i heard about the raid. pity they didn't pull it off. i wish i'd been there.}
<A>__{matt has to shout above the noise and music. jack smiles.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{but you were there matt.}
<A>__{matt doesn't hear.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what? you know what happened to me, don't you? that bitch bella shopped me. i'd like to beat the shit out of her.}
