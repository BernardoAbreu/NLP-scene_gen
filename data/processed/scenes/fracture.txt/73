<L>__{interior crawford house later that night}
<A>__{empty. dark. willy lets himself in. he looks for the light switch finds only a complex computerized dimmer panel. he tries it. accent lights come on, buried in the living room planters. he can't get any other pre sets to work. the crime scene is creepy, lit like that. the dried blood is black. shadows stretch up the walls, strange. willy grimaces, moves through it sees another panel by the french doors to the garden. goes over and jumps back, startled }
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{ by nunally, on the other side of the glass. catching his breath, willy stares. he unlocks the french doors and nunally steps in, uneasy, haggard.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{the hell are you doing here?}
<A>__{nunally looks around taking a pint bottle from his overcoat pocket, uncapping it.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{we need to talk.}
<A>__{he drinks, then offers the bottle. willy hesitates, takes it. as he drinks:}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{we have to find the gun.}
<A>__{willy winces at the liquor and the remark, hands back the bottle.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{thank you, professor einstein. it would also be good to find a couple of}
<C>__{willy }
<D>__{eyewitnesses. if one could be the dalai lama, it would be even better.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{no willy: we need to find the gun.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i've had three different teams here }
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{he didn't leave between the shooting and when we took him out in cuffs. the gun is here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so we have to find it.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{well we can't! you want to move on?}
<A>__{nunally tosses something from an inside pocket of the coat willy catches it. a heckler & koch nine millimeter in a plastic bag. willy stares down at it. then at nunally, who holds up: a bullet, deformed by impact.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{there's a guy in the evidence room, owes me a favor. well it's not so much a favor as i know stuff about him. he can trade this for the bullet from jennifer, give us a ballistic match.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{it's a crime.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{so who's gonna get away with a crime this asshole, or us?}
<A>__{willy sighs. tosses the gun back.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{go home.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{what else have you got?!}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i will find a way.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{no you won't.}
<A>__{willy watches nunally stalk out through the big, strangely lit room. the front door opens, and slams. a little worried, willy takes a deep breath. gets to work. he still has three days to break this open. walking through the crime again. playing it out in his mind. standing in different places, getting different perspectives. willy stands in the alcove. looking around. there's something here. but he can't get it. his eye falls on the rube goldberg device. moves closer, peering into the mechanism. turns away: no gun. but now he's facing the big wooden bowl of ball bearings, sitting out in the middle of the room on the coffee table. hide in plain sight. he walks over pushes his fingers in, feels around. nope. he sighs. takes a ball bearing, rolls it in his hand. goes to the device drops the ball in the slot. the machine is amazing. the ball rolls and leaps and clatters lights flash, elevators rise and fall, at one point the ball lifts on a jet of compressed air then it spirals out of sight and reappears somewhere unexpected until at the end the ball suddenly catapults out and sails across the living room to land neatly back in the bowl on the coffee table. willy grimaces. this guy is really good.}
