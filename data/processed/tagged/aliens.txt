<A>__{ripley carries an exhausted newt through the inner connecting rooms of the medical wing. she reaches an operating room which is small but very high tech ...vaultlike metal walls, strange equipment. several metal cots have been set up, displacing o.r. equipment which is pushed into one corner. newt is resting her head on ripley's shoulder, barely awake...out of steam. ripley sets her on one of the cots and newt lies down.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{now you just lie here and have a nap. you're exhausted.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{i don't want to...i have scary dreams.}

<C>__{ripley}

<A>__{ripley lifts the doll's head from newt's tiny fingers and looks inside. it is, of course, empty.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{nothing bad in here. maybe you could just try to be like her.}

<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{yes, there are, aren't there.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{why do they tell little kids that?}
<A>__{newt's voice reveals her deep sense of betrayal. she's seen that the world can be just as terrifying as her most primal child's nightmare if not more so, and that's a lot worse than finding out there is no santa.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{well, some kids can't handle it like you can.}

<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{gone.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{you mean dead.}
<A>__{it's more statement than question. ripley nods slowly. she turns, reaching for a portable space heater sitting nearby, and slides it closer to the bed. she switches it on. it hums and emits a cozy orange glow.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{ripley, i was just thinking... maybe i could do you a favor and fill in for her. just for a while. you can try it and if you don't like it, it's okay. i will understand. no big deal. whattya think?}
<A>__{ripley gazes at her a long time before answering... a conflict between the urge to crush the child to her in a forever hug and the knowledge that neither of them may see another dawn.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i think it's not the worst idea i've heard all day. let's talk about it later.}
<A>__{she switches off the light and starts to rise. newt grabs her arm. a plaintive voice in the dark.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{don't go! please.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i will be right in the other room, newt. and look...i can see you on that camera right up there.}
<A>__{newt looks at the video security camera above the door. ripley unsnaps the tracker bracelet given to her by hicks and puts it on newt's tiny wrist, cinching it down.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{here. take is for luck. now go to sleep...and don't dream.}
<A>__{ripley walks away and newt rolls on her side, hugging casey and gazing at the hypnotically pulsing function light on the bracelet. the space heater hums comfortingly.}

<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{how is he?}
<A>__{ripley stands over the lieutenant, who is lying motionless on an examining table. bishop looks up from his instruments nearby, the light of a single gooseneck lamp giving his features a macabre cast.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{i've isolated a neuro muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis. it seems to be metabolizing. he should wake up soon.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{now let me get this straight. the aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...}
<A>__{ripley points at the stasis cylinders containing the face hugger specimens.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{which would mean lots of those parasites, right? one for each person...over a hundred at least.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{yes. that follows.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{but these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{that is the question of the hour. we could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. an ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{well, the queen is always physically larger then the others. a termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all. it is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors. she is the center of their lives, quite literally the mother of their society.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{could it be intelligent?}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{hard to say. it may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves. that's if she exists, of course.}
<A>__{ripley ponders the ramifications of bishop's analysis.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{i want those specimens destroyed as soon as you're done with them. you understand?}
<A>__{bishop glances at the creatures, pulsing malevolently in their cylinders.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{mr. burke have instructions that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs. he was very specific.}

<L>__{interior med lab annex}
<A>__{in a small observation chamber separated from the med lab by a glass partition, ripley and burke have squared off.}

<D>__{those specimens are worth millions to the bio weapons division. now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes. set up for life.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you just try getting a dangerous organism past icc quarantine. section 22350 of the commerce code.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you've been doing your homework. look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{but they will know about it, burke. from me. just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty seven colonists here }
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{now, wait a second }
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(stepping on him)}
<D>__{you sent them to that ship. i just checked the colony log... directive dates six twelve seventy nine. signed burke, carter j.}
<A>__{ripley's fury is peaking, now that the frustration and rage finally have a target to focus on.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, burke. why didn't you warn them?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right? and if i'd made it a major security situation, the administration would've stepped in. then no exclusive rights, nothing.}
<A>__{he shrugs, his manner blase, dismissive.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{it was a bad call, that's all.}
<A>__{ripley snaps. she slams him against the wall, surprising herself and him, her hands gripping his collar.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{bad call? these people are fucking dead, burke! well, they're going to nail your hide to the shed... and i will be there when they do.}
<A>__{she steps back, shaking, and looks at him with utter loathing, as if the depths of human greed are a far more horrific revelation than any alien.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{i expected more of you, ripley. i thought you would be smarter than this.}
<C>__{ripley}

<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{guns a and b. tracking and firing on multiple targets.}
<A>__{the rss guns pound away, echoing through the complex. their separate bursts overlap in an irregular rhythm. a counter on the display counts down the number of rounds fired.}

<D>__{they must be wall to wall in there. look at those ammo counters go. it's a shooting gallery down there.}
<L>__{interior service tunnel tight on rss guns}

<C>__{hicks}

<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{man, listen to that.}

<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{well, that's a switch.}
<L>__{interior operations minutes later}
<A>__{everyone, including bishop, is crowded at the window, intently watching the ap station which is a dim silhouette in the mist. suddenly a column of flame, like an acetylene torch, jets upward from the complex at the base of the cone.}

<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{how long until it blows?}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{i'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours. the blast radius will be about thirty kilometers. about equal to ten megatons.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{we got problems.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{i don't fucking believe this. do you believe this?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{and it's too late to shut it down?}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{i'm afraid so. the crash did too much damage. the overload is inevitable, at this pointerior}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{oh, man. and i was gettin' short, too! four more weeks and out. now i'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock. it ain't half fair, man!}

<D>__{hudson, give us a break.}
<A>__{they watch as another gas jet lights up the fog shrouded landscape.}
<C>__{ripley}

<D>__{we need the other drop ship. the on one the sulaco. we have to bring it down on remote, somehow.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{how? the transmitter was on the apc. it's wasted.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(pacing)}
<D>__{i don't care how! think of a way. think of something.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{think of what? we're fucked.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what about the colony transmitter? that up link tower down at the other end. why can't we use that?}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{i checked. the hard wiring between here and there was severed in the fighting.}
<A>__{ripley is wound up like a dynamo, her mind spinning out options, grim solutions.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{well then somebody's just going to have to go out there. take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{oh, right! right! with those things running around. no way.}
<C>__{bishop}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i will go.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{i'm really the only one qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway. believe me, i'd prefer not to. i may be synthetic but i'm not stupid.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{all right. let's get on it. what'll you need?}
<C>__{vasquez}
<D>__{listen. it's stopped.}
<A>__{they listen. nothing. an instant later comes the high pitched trilling of a motion sensor alarm. hicks looks at the tactical board.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{well, they're into the complex.}
<L>__{interior med lab}
<A>__{one of the acid holes from the colonists' siege has yielded access to subfloor conduits. bishop lying in the opening, reaches up to graph the portable terminal as ripley hands it down to him. he pushes it into the constricted shaft ahead of him. she then hands him a small satchel containing tools and assorted patch cables, a service pistol and a small cutting torch.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{this duct runs almost to the up link assembly. one hundred eighty meters. say, forty minutes to crawl down there. one hour to patch in and align the antenna. thirty minutes to prep the ship, then about fifty minutes flight time.}
<A>__{ripley looks at her watch.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it's going to be closer. you better get going.}
<C>__{bishop}
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{see you soon.}
<A>__{she squirms into the shaft, pushing the equipment along ahead of him with a scraping rhythm. the diameter of the conduit is barely larger than the width of his shoulders. vasquez slides a metal plate over the hole and begins spot welding it in place.}
<L>__{interior conduit}
<A>__{bishop looks back as the welder seals him in. he sighs fatalistically and squirms forward. ahead of him the conduit dwindles straight to seeming infinity. like being in the bore of a very long howitzer.}
<L>__{interior med lab}
<A>__{ripley jumps as an alarm suddenly blares through the complex.}
<C>__{hicks}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{they're in the approach corridor.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{on my way.}
<A>__{ripley jumps up, unslinging a flamethrower from her shoulder in one motion, and sprints for operations with vasquez. the sound of sentry guns opening up in staccato bursts echoes from close by.}
<L>__{interior operations}
<A>__{ripley runs to the tactical console where hicks is mesmerized by the images from the surveillance cameras. the flashes of the sentry guns flare out the sensitive video, but impressions of figures moving in the smoky corridor are occasionally visible. the robot sentries hammer away, driving streamers of tracer fire into the swirling mist.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{twenty meters and closing. fifteen. c and d guns down about fifty percent.}
<A>__{the digital readout whirl through descending numbers. an inhuman shrill screeching is audible between bursts of fire.}

<D>__{now many?}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{can't tell. lots. d gun's down to twenty. ten. it's out.}
<A>__{then the firing from the remaining guns stop abruptly. the video image is a swirling wall of smoke. small fires burn, dim glows in the mist. there are black and twisted shapes, and pieces of twisted shapes, scattered at the edge of visibility. however, nothing emerges from the wall of smoke. the motion sensor tone shuts off.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{they retreated. the guns stopped them.}
<A>__{the moment stretches. everyone exhales slowly.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{yeah. but look...}
<A>__{the digital counters for the two sentry guns read "0" and "10" respectively. less than a second's worth of firing.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{newt time then can walk right up and knock.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{but they don't know that. they're probably looking for other ways to get in. that'll take them awhile.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{maybe we got 'em demoralized.}
<C>__{hicks}
<P>__{(to vasquez and hudson)}
<D>__{i want you two walking the perimeter. i know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. we've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.}

<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{how long since you slept? twenty four hours?}
<A>__{ripley shrugs. she seems soul weary, drained by the nerve wracking tension. when she answers, her voice seems distant, detached.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{they'll get us.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{maybe. maybe not.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{hicks, i'm not going to wind up like those others. you'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{if it comes to that, i will do us both. let's see that it doesn't here, i'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.}

<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{m 41a 10mm pulse rifle, over and under with a 30mm pump action grenade launcher.}
<A>__{ripley hefts the weapon. it is heavy and awkward. but there is an irrational promise of security in its lethal cold steel lines, to at least the sense that she will be in some greater measure the master of her own fate. she raises it clumsily.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what do i do?}
<L>__{interior conduit}
<A>__{bishop is in claustrophobic limbo between two echoing infinities. the pipe rings with his scraping advance. he approaches an irregular hole which admits a tiny shaft of light. he puts his eyes up to the acid etched opening. his p.o.v. as drooling jaws flash toward us, slamming against the steel with a vicious scraping snap. bishop flattens himself away from the opening and inches along, looking pale and strained. he glances at his watch.}

<D>__{just pull it in real right. it will kick some. when the counter here heads zero, hit this...}
<A>__{he thumbs a button and the magazine drops out, clattering on the floor.}
