<A>__{dr. redfield places evan's cat scan slides on the light box. andrea squints, unable to interpret them.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{well, the good news is that the results are negative. i've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{and the bad news?}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. it's harder playing detective now.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{but you must have something to go on?}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{if i had to guess, i'd say the blackouts are stress related.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{but he's seven. what kind of stress can he have?}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{plenty. who knows? maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{come on, i doubt the answer's that simple.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{you'd be surprised how often they are.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but i've been putting it off.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{it's worth a shot. i can arrange a controlled meeting. a careful dose of sedatives for jason, some security, you and i monitoring. evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{how soon?...}
