<A>__{frank gets ready for bed. he takes off the watch cara gave him and something on the back of it catches his eye. it's engraved with a name:}
<B>__{alexander pearce}
<A>__{he stares at the name for a moment, then unzips his travel bag. takes out his pills. pops a bunch. brushes his teeth. he pauses and stares at himself in the mirror as if wondering how in the world he ended up here. it's like he's staring into the face of stranger. he puts his tooth brush down and pads off to sleep on the sofa.}
