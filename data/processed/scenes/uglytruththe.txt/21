<L>__{interior abby's apartment night continuous}
<A>__{abby, now infuriated, picks up the phone and begins dialing.}
<T>__{we intercut :}
<A>__{between the stage and her apartment, as mike continues his rant.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{men don't fall in love. men fall in "want." we want things. we're hunters and gatherers. we're the same as we were when we were cavemen and a gillion years of evolution hasn't done squat. trust me, there was a pamela anderson of cave women and all the cave guys were trying to stick their dicks in her.}
<A>__{mike walks over to a chalk board with the word "love" on it. he crosses it out and writes "lust."}
<D>__{mike (cont'd) (cont'd) now girls, if you want to think lust is the same as love, that's fine, but you're delusional. let's take some more calls.}
<P>__{(picks up the phone)}
<D>__{you're on the air.}
<A>__{abby is now on the phone.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{so you're saying men are incapable of love?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{did i burst your little harlequin romance bubble?}
<A>__{irritated, abby begins to compulsively remake her bed.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{the only thing you burst is your credibility. men are absolutely capable of experiencing love.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{okay, i will bite. who's the guy?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{the guy, mr. wonderful, the one who's so capable of love. who is he? what's he like?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{well, he's not like you, that's for sure.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{thank you very much. go on.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{he's smart...he's handsome but doesn't know it...}
<P>__{(enjoying the fantasy)}
<D>__{he's successful, but in a job that means something. he loves red wine, classical music, cary grant movies...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{this is a guy in america, right? you're not calling from europe or anything.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{are you interested in listening or not?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no, please. i'm loving this.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{he works out, not because he's vain, because it's healthy. he's socially liberal but fiscally conservative. he likes dogs but he's a cat person. he never gets out of bed before you on a sunday morning }
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{oh my god. you're a lesbian!}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{well, you're describing a woman.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{why are those qualities so threatening to you? perhaps because your complete lack of any one of them is the real reason why women aren't interested in you. at least women of quality.}
<A>__{mike scoffs, but he's thrown. he takes a moment, then...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{where is this guy? i will give you one hundred dollars of my own money to bring him down here and let me meet him.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{oh, he's out there...somewhere.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{wait a second. you're not even dating this guy?!}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{well, no...i'm just describing a type...i thought that's what we were doing.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you don't even know him?!?}
<A>__{mike bowls over laughing. abby realizes she's been had.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{hold on...whoa...now i get the whole picture. you're a dog.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<A>__{she rips the perfectly made bed apart and starts over.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you heard me. you must be. if you were hot, you'd be out breaking some poor schmuck's heart instead of spending all your time fantasizing about mr. wonderful. face it, you're ugly!}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i am not ugly!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{well, of course you don't think so. ugly people never know they're ugly. it's like people who have b.o. they never know it because they're surrounded by their own stench all the time.}
<A>__{now abby's really fuming. she snaps a sheet violently.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{that is the most ridic }
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{look, lemme help you out here. you might as well just face the fact that you're gonna be alone and stop pining away for some fantasy guy you're never going to get. get a hobby. build housing for the poor. anything.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{how could you possibly }
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{hey, lassie the show's called "the ugly truth". if you can't face it, don't call.}
<P>__{(switching gears)}
<D>__{well that about wraps it up for today. i'm mike alexander reminding you that the truth is never pretty.}
<A>__{as he smiles smugly, abby screams and throws the phone across the room. d'artagnan, terrified, jumps off the bed, which is now in total disarray.}
