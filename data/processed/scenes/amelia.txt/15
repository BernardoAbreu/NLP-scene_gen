<L>__{interior hangar, east boston airport night}
<A>__{the heavy door rolls open. george and amelia enter the brightly lit hangar to see two men working on the friendship, a sea plane with golden wings. its red orange fuselage stands beside gigantic pontoons, each 29 feet long. the pontoons have been opened, and the men are attaching them to the plane. they turn toward us now. bill stultz is short and wiry with quick eyes. only 28, he seems weathered by his adventures and the streaks of gray through his hair. he is not necessarily happy to see us.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{george had told me stultz was adm. byrd's favorite pilot, fearless, gifted. he drank. but george said it never affected his work.}
<A>__{george waves as we approach. bill and amelia seem locked on each other.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) when he said it, i must have had a funny look. so i just said, ‘yeh, i grew up around a guy like that.’}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{boys, i'd like to introduce your commander, miss amelia earhart.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{we felt ‘commander’ was less grandiose than, say, ‘empress.’}
<A>__{bill doesn’t smile. the other man does...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{say hello to slim gordon your navigator.}
<A>__{she is shaking hands in that strong, direct way.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{and bill stultz here, simply the most talented pilot working.}
<A>__{she takes bill's powerful hand. the look between them calm, yet somehow intense. as if each is establishing a tone for their relationship.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{we've got byrd's pilot, we've got his plane...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{you mean the admiral flies on those?}
<A>__{the pontoons. she does not seem admiring.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{nope, those are new, personally suggested by the old man himself.}
<A>__{bill nods on that. sure were.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{this way, if you're forced down at sea, you can wait for a rescue.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{hmmn. what does that do to our fuel?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{costs us at least 400 gallons. don't bother bringing clothes for paris, we'll be lucky to hit the nearest beach in ireland. real lucky.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the admiral estimates the pontoons only cut our range by 200 miles.}
<A>__{but amelia looks to bill. that's not really possible is it?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the admiral is the admiral. he gets to estimate any damn thing he wants. all we have to do is figure out how to fly without petrol.}
<A>__{she turns to george with challenging eyes.}
<P>__{bill (cont’d)}
<D>__{don't go blaming the bookseller. he's been all through this with mrs. guest, but she worships the admiral. and it's money that puts planes in the air.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i wonder if it can keep them up there. not that i've ever had enough to try.}
<A>__{bill’s small smile. maybe the girl’s all right.}
