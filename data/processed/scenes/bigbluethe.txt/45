<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{jacques, my friend, how are you?}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(happy)}
<D>__{enzo...}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{i leave you swimming and twenty years later, you're still in the water! what the hell are you doing? training?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{an uneasiness sweeps over enzo's face and quickly disappears.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{that's good.}
<P>__{(smiling again)}
<D>__{you never would have recognized me, huh? check out the suit! looking good, no? you know i'm the world champion?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{yes, i know.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{i dove 315 feet!}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{great!}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{they say i'm like lazarus. you know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!}
<A>__{he laughs. jacques smiles. enzo goes on.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(serious)}
<D>__{doesn't it surprise you that i just show up like this... listen, the world championship starts in ten days in taormina. be my guest.}
<A>__{enzo puts down an airplane ticket on the side of the pool.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{your ticket.}
<A>__{surprised, jacques looks over at the ticket.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{because i'm sure you're dying to beat me.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{i don't want to be in any competition... i dive because i like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{no. all you need is to want to be the best.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you're the best, enzo!}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(with a tense grin on his face)}
<D>__{that's too easy! every time i beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me: "d'you know that french guy, mayol? he's supposed to be very good! too bad he doesn't compete." so, you're going to come with me to taormina! first, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.}
<P>__{(he pushes the}
<D>__{airplane ticket to}
<P>__{jacques)}
