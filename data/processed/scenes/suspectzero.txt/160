<A>__{o'ryan is behind the wheel, driving.}
<L>__{interior stolen car driving moments later (dusk)}
<A>__{the radio is blasting anything to shake those images out of his head. driving, unsettled... which may be why he doesn't notice that there's a siren wailing behind him. he looks in the rear view. a texas state trooper is on his tail. shit. o'ryan tightens, pulling over...}

<A>__{the trooper approaches, noting the condition of the vehicle. he stands before o'ryan's window. o'ryan's face reveals no evidence at all of anxiety.}

<D>__{evening.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{evening, officer.}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{see your license, sir?}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{'course. is there a problem?}
<A>__{o'ryan reaches into his back pocket, produces an i.d. hands it over. trooper eyes it. according to this i.d., we are now staring at "james garvey" from littleton, colorado. but the trooper doesn't seem too convinced.}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{see your registration, please?}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{o'ryan opens up the glove compartment, starts searching through it. but it's a stall, that's obvious.}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{mind stepping out of the car, please?}
<A>__{o'ryan pauses. there is no way in hell he's going to let himself get deterred by a state trooper. but he gets out.}
