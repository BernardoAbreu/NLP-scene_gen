<L>__{interior the sub base docking bay}
<A>__{the wurrfler has arrived at an extraordinary base built in the hollow interior of the island. this chamber, with the docking bay, is almost all water. a huge natural cavern, it has been reinforced and enlarged by the germans. the wurrfler sits surfaced at the dock. the ark has been unloaded and placed on a cart. shliemann, belloq and marion have just disembarked and been met by a nazi contingent from the base. marion looks worse for the trip. her white nightgown is now ripped and smudged. one of the greeting nazis, a tall captain, salutes shliemann and belloq. as he speaks to them, we notice that right behind this group, just above a great deal of sub unloading activity, indy's whip hangs from the periscope. working nazis pass within feet of it unaware; the tall captain would see it in a moment if he were not so focused on the new arrivals.}

<P>__{(to belloq)}
<D>__{the tents have been arranged in accordance with your radioed instructions, sir.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{good. we must take the ark there now.}
<A>__{shliemann looks a little unhappy about this exchange, but says nothing. the group moves swiftly toward the end of a mine train arrangement. the train, consisting of small, separate, electric powered cars, sits on a track which disappears into a tunnel cut in the rock. on the turret of the wurrfler, the wurrfler's captain lights a cigarette as he watches the mine train disappear, then returns his attention to the activity on the dock. he leans idly against the periscope, his head two feet below indy's dangling whip. something catches his eye, he yells an order and climbs down from the turret to deal with the matter. we hold on the whip for a long moment, until its owner's hand appears and quickly reclaims it.}
