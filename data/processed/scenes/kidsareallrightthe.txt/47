<L>__{exterior alley day}
<A>__{we cut onto paul and laser, looking out at something. laser is holding a digital video camera.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{this may not be a good idea.}
<C>__{clay }
<D>__{are you filming?!}
<A>__{we cut to clay on a skateboard on the ledge of a brick wall. he's preparing to ride the ledge, jump a dumpster and land his board on the ground.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(to laser)}
<D>__{he's not gonna make it.}
<P>__{(calling to clay)}
<D>__{clay, you're not gonna make it!}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{i think he may be right, dude. maybe this isn't such a good idea.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{will you quit being a man gina and run the camera! i'm only doing this once so keep my shit in frame!}
<A>__{laser sighs, then holds up the camera. paul looks at laser, wondering why he puts up with this guy. video camera's pov: we watch as clay psychs himself up with an assortment of deep breaths and head slaps. finally, he starts down the ledge. he starts his jump, catches air and hits the edge of the dumpster and falls. we see him go into the dumpster and land with a nauseating thud. paul and laser rush up and look over the edge.}
<D>__{paul laser are you okay?!}
<A>__{there's clay, his arm bent at a disturbing angle, in agony.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{did you get that?!}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{seriously, dude, are you okay?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm fucking fine! fuck! did you fucking get it?!}
