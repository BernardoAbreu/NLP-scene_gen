<L>__{exterior n.y.c. street early evening}
<A>__{kate races from the subway station, entering the arthur murray dance studio. leopold, thoroughly disheveled, follows at a distance.}
<L>__{interior dance studio evening}
<A>__{elderly blue haired couples chat amongst themselves, men on the right, women on the left. kate, in dance clothes, out of breath, stumbles in, making a b line for the women's side.}
<C>__{mrs. pincus}
<D>__{i was worried. i thought you weren't going to make it.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(smiling happily)}
<D>__{miss my lesson? this is the only thing i have to look forward to all week. is that a new dress mrs. pincus?}
<A>__{mrs. pincus executes a fancy spin, proudly showing off her purchase. across the room, mr. pincus beams in anticipation. an elderly, overly made up dance instructor enters. she claps her hands together loudly.}
<C>__{instructor}
<D>__{all right, kids. pair up!}
<A>__{the men slick back their hair. the women straighten their gowns. kate stands to the side, self consciously studying the floor. the men take their places on the dance floor. they flick their hand twice, inviting their women to dance. cooly, elegantly, the women approach their partners. after a while kate looks up, relieved. she stands alone. ballroom music plays. the couples effortlessly shift between steps and turns. kate dances with an imaginary partner, stumbling, more than a beat behind, counting, animated, a concentrated yearning look spread across her face. the instructor approaches with a look of resignation.}
<C>__{instructor}
<D>__{don't think so much, katie. feel the music.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(sweating)}
<D>__{i am!}
<C>__{instructor}
<D>__{dancing should not be work. it should be a vacation the body takes from the mind. let the music wash over you.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{it is!}
<C>__{instructor}
<D>__{repeat after me: i've got the muusic in me.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i've got the muusic in me. instructor & kate}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{i've got the muusic in me!}
<C>__{instructor}
<D>__{keep telling yourself that.}
<A>__{kate does. her instructor shakes her head and moves away. across the room, through the window, leopold watches, moved. leopold's p.o.v. over the music, beyond the swirling couples, kate remains in the corner, dancing with her imaginary partner, fighting valiantly for the right steps, muttering to herself, dancing alone.}
