<A>__{pk stoops in the small cave, dripping wet. a moment later doc's foot appears at the entrance. pk helps him in. doc slumps down, exhausted.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{breathing too hard to reply, doc shakes his head in the affirmative. pk looks out at the rain forming a sheer wall of water outside. he turns to doc, who is getting up, flashlight in hand.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{exploring.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{why don't you just rest?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{plenty time for resting when i am something else. look.}
<A>__{he strikes a match. a wind from inside the cave blows it side to side.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{when does a cave have wind? this is more than some little cave, my friend.}
<A>__{doc crouches down and follows the beam of his flashlight to the rear of the cave where there is a small opening. he shines the light into it.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{here. see? there is a passage.}
<A>__{before pk can say anything else, doc has wriggled through the small opening. pk, a bit peeved, takes his own flashlight and follows.}
