<A>__{cosette turns and runs in to the house. valjean walks down the overgrown garden path to the gate. marius moves quickly away, instinctively nervous of discovery, and hides behind the wall. valjean peers into the shadows. he senses that perhaps cosette has been talking to someone. he looks pensive. valjean returns inside. cosette has dropped a keepsake through the gate. marius picks it up. marius makes his way back down the street, filled with thoughts of his love. completely forgetting eponine is there. shadows move up the street from the other direction. it's thenardier and his gang. they gather at the wrought iron gate.}
