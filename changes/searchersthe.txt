<LOC>__{EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - CLOSE SHOT - MOVING JUST ABOVE GROUND}
<ACTION>__{LEVEL - A STUDY OF HOOFPRINTS - LATE AFTERNOON The hoofprints are deeply etched in the ground, picking their way through scrubby desert growth. An occasional tumbleweed drifts with the light breeze across the pattern of prints; and lightly-blown soil and sand begin the work of erasing them. The CAMERA FOLLOWING the hoofprints}
<TRANS>__{RAISES SLOWLY TO:}
<LOC>__{EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON}
<ACTION>__{We see the rider now. BACK TO CAMERA, jogging slowly along -- heading down a long valley toward a still-distant ranch house with its outlying barn and corrals.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - MED. SHOT - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON}
<ACTION>__{The CAMERA FRAMES and MOVES with the lone horseman. He is ETHAN EDWARDS, a man as hard as the country he is crossing. Ethan is in his forties, with a three-day stubble of beard. Dust is caked in the lines of his face and powders his clothing. He wears a long Confederate overcoat, torn at one pocket, patched and clumsily stitched at the elbows. His trousers are a faded blue with an off-color stripe down the legs where once there had been the yellow stripes of the Yankee cavalry. His saddle is Mexican and across it he carries a folded serape in place of the Texas poncho... Rider and horse have come a long way. The CAMERA HOLDS and PANS the rider past and we see another detail; strapped onto his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray silk sash wrapped around it... Horse and rider pass, moving closer to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come tearing around the corner of the house.}
<LOC>__{EXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. SHOT - DEBBIE -}
<ACTION_ALT>__{LATE AFTERNOON}
<ACTION>__{She is staring wide-eyed at the distant horseman o.s. Her little dog has seen him too and is barking excitedly. DEBBIE quickly reaches to grab the dog by the scruff of the neck, crouching over him. Debbie is 11 years old with a piquant, memorable face.}
<LOC>__{EXT. THE YARD - CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE}
<ACTION>__{Here we must establish and dramatize what it is about her face that is memorable, so that if we were to see her again five or six years later, we would know it is she -- perhaps the eye color or the slant of eyebrow, or a trick of scratching bridge of nose with crooked forefinger.}
<LOC>__{EXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. SHOT - AARON - LATE AFTERNOON}
<ACTION>__{The ranch house is of adobe, solidly built, with a sod and cross-timbered roof, deep windows. A small gallery or porch extends across the front. AARON EDWARDS comes through the door, attracted by the dog's barking -- and then he, too, sees the approaching horseman and comes farther out -- curious but not at all apprehensive. Aaron is a lean, weathered and tired man, with a down-swept mustache; a gentler-looking man than Ethan and possibly a few years older. As he squints off, studying the rider, his older daughter, LUCY, comes out to stand behind him. Lucy is from 16 to 18 -- a pleasant, feminine girl. She is carrying a mixing bowl with some sort of batter in it, which she now completely forgets to whip in her interest in the approaching stranger. In the next instant MARTHA EDWARDS follows the daughter onto the porch. Martha is a still-lovely woman, although the years have etched fine wrinkles about her eyes and mouth, and work has worn and coarsened her hands. Those hands will never be idle when Martha is on scene... And now, while she shares the family's interest in the approaching horseman, she automatically notes that Lucy has forgotten her task -- and she takes the mixing bowl from her and stirs the batter.}
<LOC>__{EXT. YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON}
<ACTION>__{Along the side of the house comes BEN EDWARDS, 14, with a man-sized armload of chunkwood clutched to his chest. He, too, has spotted the stranger and is all attention. So much so that he trips, but recovers his footing. He pauses to dump the wood into a woodbox by the door -- his eyes always riveted on the oncoming rider -- and then he moves toward the others, biting a splinter out of a finger. Beyond Ben, MARTIN PAULEY emerges from the barn and crosses the open ground heading toward CAMERA. Martin is somewhat under 20, a lithe, perfectly coordinated male animal, with Indian-straight hair and a white man's eyes. He is carrying bridle or other horse-gear. He looks to the family on the porch -- to see if they recognize the stranger -- then out again. He continues, followed by Ben, toward where Debbie crouches over her dog.}

<LOC>__{EXT. THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA, LUCY, AND}
<ACTION>__{AARON - LATE AFTERNOON Suddenly, Martha's eyes widen as she -- even before Aaron -- recognizes the distant rider. Her hand goes to her mouth to check the name that trembles on her lips... An instant later Aaron, too, identifies the oncoming horseman.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(incredulous)}
<DIAL>__{Ethan?}
<ACTION>__{He looks at her, frowning, then slowly steps out onto the hard ground. Martha hands the bowl back to Lucy and follows Aaron.}

<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hello, Aaron...}

<DIAL>__{Martha...}
<CHAR>__{MARTHA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a bit shakily)}
<DIAL>__{Hello, Ethan.}
<ACTION>__{Ethan slowly, stiffly swings out of the saddle. Aaron and Martha exchange quick glances... troubled, puzzled. Aaron pastes on an uncertain smile as Ethan comes around his horse toward their side.}

<DIAL>__{How's California?}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{But Mose Harper said...}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That old goat still creakin' around?... Whyn't someone bury him?}
<ACTION>__{He goes to his saddle pack, begins unlacing it. Ben and Debbie have inched closer -- half-shy, half-curious. Debbie's dog begins sniffing at his heels. Ethan looks down at them - not unfriendly, just a man not used to children.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ben, ain't you?}
<ACTION>__{Ben nods.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(wheeling on him)}
<DIAL>__{MOMENTO!}
<ACTION>__{Martin checks his stride, stares in surprise.}
<CHAR>__{MARTHA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(contritely)}
<DIAL>__{Martin!... Here we've been standing... Ethan, you haven't forgotten Martin?}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh... Mistook you for a half-breed.}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(levelly)}
<DIAL>__{Not quite... Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh... So they tell me.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{It just happened to be me... No need to make any more of it...}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll take care of your horse for you, Uncle Ethan.}
<ACTION>__{Again, he starts to lead away.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hold on!}
<ACTION>__{Martin stops again.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll take this...}
<ACTION>__{He completes unlacing the pack and takes it -- treating it as though it contained something of value. Martin watches with a touch of resentment: Ethan doesn't trust him. Ethan turns and sees the look. He doesn't care what Martin thinks, nor does he explain. Martin leads the horse off.}
<CHAR>__{MARTHA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Supper'll be ready by the time you wash up... Let me take your coat for you, Ethan.}
<ACTION>__{He hesitates, then grudgingly surrenders it -- conscious of its sorry condition.}
<CHAR>__{MARTHA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(smiling faintly)}
<DIAL>__{And... welcome home.}
<ACTION>__{He just nods, then turns to follow Aaron around the side of the house toward the wash-up.}

<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE TO:}
<LOC>__{INT. EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The family is finishing dinner -- and the scene is not quite, but almost, a still-life. Loud in the room is the pendulum tick of a Seth-Thomas clock on the mantel above the fireplace -- in which logs are burning briskly. Ben crouches near the fireplace, fascinatedly examining the scabbard and sabre Ethan has brought home from the wars. He tries to ease the blade just a bit out of its scabbard. Aaron sits at one end of the hand-hewn table, Martha at the other. At her right is Ethan, his fork scraping the last crumb off his plate. Lucy sits at her father's right and Martin at his left. Next to Martin is Debbie. In the center of the table is the sorry remnant of what was once a meal. Lucy and Martin have finished eating. Aaron is sipping his coffee, and Martha -- her own plate largely untasted -- is watching Ethan. Ethan has shaved, changed his shirt. He straightens contentedly and every eye is on him, expectantly.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good.}
<ACTION>__{The clock rattles alarmingly -- the usual preliminary to its striking; and then it bangs out the strokes like a fire-alarm gong. Eight fast clangs.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ben! Deborah! Bed!}
<CHAR>__{DEBBIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But I've got to help with the dishes.}
<CHAR>__{MARTHA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not tonight... Ben, put that sword back.}
<CHAR>__{BEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not a sword, ma... it's a saber!}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(moving to Ethan)}
<DIAL>__{Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(matter-of-factly)}
<DIAL>__{Some...}
<CHAR>__{BEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How many damYankees, Uncle Ethan?}
<CHAR>__{MARTHA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ben!... Martin, he'll sleep in the bunkhouse with you tonight.}
<ACTION>__{Martin nods and crosses to kiss Martha good night.}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good night, Aunt Martha... Uncle Aaron...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(he hesitates)}
<DIAL>__{Good night, Uncle Ethan.}
<ACTION>__{Ethan doesn't like being called Uncle -- as we must know from the quick look he shoots at Martin. But he acknowledges it.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Night.}
<ACTION>__{Ben reluctantly puts the scabbard away, turns to Ethan.}
<CHAR>__{BEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Will you tell me tomorrow about the war?}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The war ended three years ago, boy!}
<CHAR>__{BEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It did?... Then whyn't you come home before now?}
<CHAR>__{MARTHA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{BEN!... Go 'long with Martin. MARCH!}
<ACTION>__{As Ben reluctantly heads out with Martin, Deborah crosses to Ethan's side and studies him gravely.}
<CHAR>__{DEBBIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Lucy's wearing the gold locket you gave her when she was a little girl...}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh?}

<DIAL>__{She don't wear it much account of it makes her neck green.}
<CHAR>__{LUCY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(aghast)}
<DIAL>__{Deborah!}
<CHAR>__{DEBBIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(defensively)}
<DIAL>__{Well, it does... But I wouldn't care if you gave me a gold locket if it made my neck green or not.}
<ACTION>__{Ethan looks at her gravely.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{'Fraid I...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(then he remembers something, rises)}
<DIAL>__{Wait.}
<ACTION>__{He crosses to where his pack is -- a side table or something -- and burrows into it. Debbie is at his side.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How about this?}
<ACTION>__{It is a gold medal or medallion -- something appropriate to Maximilian of Mexico -- suspended by a long multi-colored satin ribbon.}
<CHAR>__{DEBBIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh! LOOK! My gold locket!}
<ACTION>__{She holds it high for mother -- and all -- to see. Martha takes it and reacts at its weight.}
<CHAR>__{MARTHA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's solid gold... Ethan, I don't think she's old enough...}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Let her keep it... Just something I picked up in Mexico.}
<ACTION>__{Martha reluctantly surrenders it to Debbie's eager hand. Aaron hasn't missed the word "Mexico" and looks sharply at Ethan.}
<CHAR>__{DEBBIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, thank you, Uncle Ethan...}
<CHAR>__{LUCY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Debbie)}
<DIAL>__{Come along...}
<ACTION>__{The two girls leave the main room. Martha and Aaron both look at Ethan -- half expecting some further explanation. He turns from them and looks into the fire. Martha begins to clear the table. Aaron gets up, takes a pipe and a spill -- lights it at the fire.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{They gave up... went back to the cotton rows... So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know... She wouldn't let a man quit.}
<ACTION>__{Ethan turns and looks at her -- still busy with her dishes.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(change of tone)}
<DIAL>__{Ethan, I could see it in you before the war...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Ethan looks at him)}
<DIAL>__{You wanted to clear out!}
<ACTION>__{Martha freezes in what she's doing -- listening.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And you stayed out beyond all need to... WHY?}
<ACTION>__{Ethan can't answer, but he takes it as a challenge and almost welcomes it.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(hard)}
<DIAL>__{You askin' me to clear out now?}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(straightening -- with grave dignity)}
<DIAL>__{You're my brother... You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to... Ain't that so, Martha?}
<CHAR>__{MARTHA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(almost a whisper)}
<DIAL>__{Of course he is.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I expect to pay my own way...}
<ACTION>__{Martha resumes her activity. Ethan crosses to his pack, reaches into it for a leather pouch, brings it back and tosses it onto the table. It lands with a resonant clink. Both Martha and Aaron draw close to the table. (NOTE TO WINTON HOCH: This scene should be dramatically back- lighted.)}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There's sixty double eagles in there... twelve-hundred dollars.}
<ACTION>__{He opens a waistline shirt button and hauls out a leather money belt and drops that on the table.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{An' twice that in here.}
<ACTION>__{He reaches into the belt and takes out a few mint-fresh gold pieces which he slides across the table.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...only these got the late Emperor Maximilian's picture on 'em.}
<ACTION>__{Martha picks up one of the gold pieces, staring at the face on the coin: the same as that on the medal -- staring sharply then at Ethan. Aaron is examining another coin with a different interest.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mint fresh... not a mark on 'em.}
<ACTION>__{He glances questioningly at Ethan.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So?}
<ACTION>__{Aaron shrugs and crosses to a barrel chair. He raises the seat and lifts out a pair of old boots, some rags of clothing and then raises a false-bottom lid and drops pouch and money belt into it. Carefully he replaces everything. During this Ethan's attention has gone to Martha's hand, to one cut finger, its wound barely healed. He takes the hand -- gently.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Cut yourself?}
<ACTION>__{She nods and withdraws the hand.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(softly)}
<DIAL>__{You were always hurting about your hands.}
<ACTION>__{She looks quickly at him and self-consciously tries to hide her hands, conscious of their work-worn appearance. Then for a moment their eyes meet and hold -- and a world of sadness and hopelessness is in the look. Aaron closes the seat of the barrel chair.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Time for bed...}
<ACTION>__{He picks up one of the lamps and starts away toward their bedroom door. Martha looks at Ethan again. His expression is bitter.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Night, Ethan... Come 'long, Martha.}
<ACTION>__{She turns obediently and follows Aaron. Ethan looks after them and waits as Aaron opens the bedroom door. Martha goes into it and Aaron follows and closes the door. Ethan crosses to the lamp on the mantel, blows it out. Only the firelight strikes his face as he stares broodingly at the closed bedroom door.}

<TRANS>__{THE SIX HORSEMEN ARE:}
<ACTION>__{CAPTAIN, THE REVEREND SAM CLAYTON, a big man with frosty blue eyes, graying hair, a bristly full mustache and the air of grave and resolute authority. He is a minister of the Gospel with a .44 on his hip. LARS JORGENSEN, the Edwards' neighbor, is a harried little man, Scandinavian. As we shall find out soon, he has a brisk and buxom wife and a rather astonishing brood of children. BRAD JORGENSEN is one of these: sandy-haired, brash, amiable, impulsive. He is in his early twenties. CHARLIE MacCORRY, slightly older than Brad, is Sergeant of Company A of the Rangers. (He is also Company A.) Charlie is a taciturn, gently-spoken, competent man, clearly patterned by his association with Captain, the Rev. Sam. MOSE HARPER is an old scout -- a walking bone-rack, yet capable of tireless feats of endurance. Some think him "tetched" yet he has managed to endure to his age during a time and in a region where few men lived to see their grandchildren. He wears a ragged dark overcoat in all weather, a narrow-brimmed hat with a feather in its band. ED NESBY is a rancher and homesteader in his mid-thirties; resolute, honest, self-effacing; nothing picturesque or dramatic about him; just a solid citizen and a realist.}

Martin, with an armful of trade goods -- a few yards of bright calico, a couple of AGED SOW rosettes and some trinkets -- is indicating the blanket. Look glances shyly at her father. He shakes his head negatively. Look is disappointed. The father points to Martin's pile of trade goods. Martin bends and picks up the indicated object: it is a battered high-crowned beaver hat. The Indian grunts his approval and puts it on. Look looks relieved. Martin reaches for the blanket. Look takes a quick step backward and holds up one finger: wait!

<ACTION>__{Martin is running with Debbie, trying to pull her along, while she kicks and claws and tries to break free. (They are about thirty yards from the camp proper.) Riderless horses are milling, circling. O.s. we can hear the firing, the yells.}
<LOC>__{EXT. SCAR'S TEPEE - FULL SHOT}
<ACTION>__{Ethan remounts and heads around the side of Scar's tepee. In the distance we see Martin and Debbie. The Rangers, regrouping, are charging back through the camp, driving the Comanche horse herd.}

<ACTION>__{He goes running into the path of Ethan's horse.}
<LOC>__{EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MOVING SHOT - ETHAN}
<ACTION>__{as Martin runs and grabs hold of his stirrup, trying to fight the horse to a stop. Ethan swings on him -- once, twice -- and Martin is knocked sprawling. Ethan rides on, relentlessly.}
<LOC>__{EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - DEBBIE AND ETHAN}
<ACTION>__{She is running and dodging, trying to escape the horseman. Ethan has his gun drawn. She ducks to one side and the horse goes past. Both figures are almost obscured in the dust. Ethan spins his mount and charges after her. She runs and then falls -- and he is off his horse and striding toward her.}
<LOC>__{EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - ETHAN AND DEBBIE}
<ACTION>__{Ethan is at the left of CAMERA and slightly closer to the foreground, with Debbie at the right, supine on the ground and the dust swirling around her. Ethan draws and raises his gun. The hammer goes back.}

<DIAL>__{I'm sorry, girl... Shut your eyes...}
<ACTION>__{The dust clears. The CAMERA MOVES slightly forward along the gun arm and HOLDS on Debbie's face -- the eyes gazing fearlessly, innocently into Ethan's. We HOLD for a long moment and then the gun lowers. Ethan slowly holsters it and walks over to her.}

<ACTION>__{The line of Rangers is afoot now, each man near his horse, each man with rifle out, pumping shot after shot at the fleeting remnant of Comanches riding down the long valley with their scattered horse herd milling and criss-crossing in mid-ground... And then as the firing slackens, from afar we can hear the blare of a cavalry bugle sounding the charge: sign of the approach of Greenhill's troop.}

<ACTION>__{It is perhaps half an hour later. Clayton is very grim of face and occasionally wincing. His trousers are down over his ankles, his shirt-tails flapping over his long-handled red underwear. Behind him Charlie MacCorry is kneeling, applying some crude first aid to Sam's rump. Beyond them some of the Rangers are readying for the move-out. Sam looks up angrily as COLONEL GREENHILL, a guidon bearer, and bugler ride in. Greenhill is a choleric man.}

<LOC>__{EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - CLOSE SHOT - LT. GREENHILL}
<ACTION>__{He is standing with his sabre at salute -- looking as miserable as any shavetail would look when in disgrace. It could be that the end of the sabre has a pronounced bend.}

<ACTION>__{Sam suddenly slaps MacCorry's hand away and grabs for his pants and pulls them up -- and around a tepee come three figures -- Ethan, Debbie, and Martin -- with Ethan holding Debbie's hand. And Sam's face is split by a grin as he tucks his shirt-tails in and goes to meet them.}

<ACTION>__{He is in a rocker on the porch. Suddenly he stares out and stops rocking. Faint in the distance, but coming closer, the clop-clop of two horses, moving at a walk. A moment later Jorgensen emerges and comes to stand beside Mose, shading his eyes and squinting against the sun, still not recognizing the distant horsemen.  He is joined by Mrs. Jorgensen. And then Laurie comes out and she too stares, frowning at first, then with dawning realization. Lars and Mrs. Jorgensen also begin to guess... to suspect... and then to know. And Laurie starts to run. CLOSE SHOT - MOVING WITH LAURIE The CAMERA MOVES ahead of her as she runs blindly over the hard-packed ground, running as hard as she can toward the still unseen but nearing horsemen. FULL SHOT - THE GROUP Ethan has Debbie on the pommel of his saddle, his arm supporting her, and she is asleep. Martin is riding beside them. Laurie comes running up to stare at Ethan and at the girl. He smiles and puts a finger to his lips -- cautioning her against waking Debbie -- and then he rides by. Laurie looks then at Martin. He doesn't know whether to smile or not; he just waits. And then she is beside him and she steps onto his stirruped foot and vaults up beside him, and she kisses him just as she had on the day he left the graves to take up the search. And still holding her beside him, he rides slowly after Ethan and Debbie toward the house.}
