<L>__{interior transformation chamber night}
<A>__{leonard leads the thing inside. the ominous chamber sits with its door open. victor enters from the control station.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{ben, come in.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what is this? where's reed?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{where do you think? with sue.}
<A>__{ben looks at the flickering lights. suspicious. victor turns to leonard, who looks a little scared by this dark room.}
<C>__{victor }
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{i will take it from here, leonard.}
<A>__{leonard nods, all too eager to get the hell out of here.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<A>__{leonard disappears fast, as victor turns back to ben.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what do you want, vic?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{to help you. i've run every test known to man. and they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.}
<A>__{ben shakes his head, wanting to believe, but...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{reed said it'd be weeks till }
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{he also said we'd avoid that storm in space. and we know how that turned out.}
<A>__{ben nods. reed was wrong before. ben gets closer to the machine, drawn to it. he wants to believe, so badly.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{he couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. yet another mistake for "mr. fantastic."}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{and you can? power it up?}
<A>__{victor stands in shadows, but we see the tiniest little spark around him. the lights...? or his skin...?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{yes. i've found a new energy source.}
<A>__{he keeps his arm behind his back his fingertips course with electricity. it starts to build, sparking up his arm.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{tell me...do you want to be ben grimm again?}
<A>__{ben keeps his eyes on the machine. his dream is alive.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{let's do it.}
