<D>__{to be reduced to the condition of visitor in my own home! it is not to be borne, elinor!}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{consider, mamma! we have nowhere to go.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{john and fanny will descend from london at any moment, followed no doubt by cartloads of relatives ready to turn us out of our rooms one by one do you expect me to be here to welcome them? vultures!}
<A>__{she suddenly collapses into a chair and bursts into tears.}

<D>__{i shall start making inquiries for a new house at once. until then we must try to bear their coming.}

<D>__{i meant something less mournful, dearest.}

<A>__{john and fanny are waiting as the ostlers make the final adjustments to their carriage. the landlord hovers, waiting for a tip.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{a hundred pounds a year to their mother while she lives. would that be more advisable? it is better than parting with the fifteen hundred all at once.}
<A>__{he displays some coins in his hand. fanny removes one and nods.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{but if she should live longer than fifteen years we would be completely taken in. people always live forever when there is an annuity to be paid them.}

<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{why are they coming to live at norland? they already have a house in london.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{because houses go from father to son, dearest not from father to daughter. it is the law.}

<A>__{john and fanny joggle on.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{twenty pounds now and then will amply discharge my promise, you are quite right.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{indeed. although to say the truth, i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them money.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{they will have five hundred a year amongst them as it is }
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{ and what on earth can four women want for more than that? their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage, no horses, hardly any servants and will keep no company. only conceive how comfortable they will be!}

<A>__{the large contingent of servants who staff norland park are gathered in gloomy silence as elinor addresses them.}

<L>__{interior norland park dining room early eve}
<A>__{the entire family, with the exception of margaret, is present. betsy is serving food in an atmosphere of stiff silence. cutlery clinks. john chews loudly. marianne is rigid with resentment. mrs dashwood maintains a cool, removed dignity. elinor tries to play hostess.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{how is mrs ferrars?}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{my mother is always in excellent health, thank you. my brother robert is in town with her this season and quite the most popular bachelor in london! he has his own barouche.}
<A>__{in the brief silence which follows this, fanny surreptitiously checks the hallmark on her butterknife.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{you have two brothers, have you not?}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{indeed, yes. edward is the eldest mamma quite depends upon him. he is traveling up from plymouth shortly and will break his journey here.}
<A>__{mrs dashwood looks at elinor pointedly. john notices.}

<P>__{(to mrs dashwood)}
<D>__{if that is agreeable to you, of course.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{my dear john this is your home now.}
<A>__{fanny looks about, barely able to conceal her satisfaction.}
<L>__{interior norland park elinor's bedroom day}
<A>__{elinor is sitting with a little pile of parcels. she puts a shawl into some paper and ties it with ribbon as marianne thunders in, looking mutinous.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{fanny wishes to know where the key for the silver cabinet is kept.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{betsy has it, i think. what does fanny want with the silver?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i can only presume she wants to count it. what are you doing?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{presents for the servants. have you seen margaret? i am worried about her. she has taken to hiding in the oddest places.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{fortunate girl. at least she can escape fanny, which is more than any of us is able.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{you do your best. you have not said a word to her for a week.}
<C>__{marianne}
<P>__{(truculently)}
<D>__{i have! i have said 'yes' and 'no'.}
<L>__{interior norland park breakfast room day}
<A>__{fanny, mrs dashwood, elinor and john are at breakfast. marianne enters. elinor catches her eye and indicates fanny with a slight motion of her head. marianne makes a face.}
<C>__{marianne}
<P>__{(very polite)}
<D>__{good morning, fanny.}
<A>__{fanny is rather startled.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{good morning, marianne.}
<A>__{elinor is relieved.}
<C>__{marianne}
<P>__{(to fanny)}
<D>__{how did you find the silver? is it all genuine?}
<A>__{elinor rushes in before marianne gets any further.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{pray, when may we expect the pleasure of your brother's company?}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{edward is due tomorrow. and my dear mrs dashwood, in view of the fact that he will not be with us for long, i wondered if miss margaret would mind giving up her room to him the view is quite incomparable from her windows and i should so much like edward to see norland at its best.}

<A>__{elinor and marianne are removing margaret's toys.}

<A>__{a very capable horseman (edward ferrars) canters up the gravel drive. close on his face as he gazes up at the elegant facade.}
<L>__{interior norland park drawing room day}
<A>__{everyone except margaret is present. edward has just shaken bands with elinor. he behaves with great respect to the dashwoods and seems embarrassed by fanny's pro prietorial air.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{but where is miss margaret? i declare, mrs dashwood, i am beginning to doubt of her existence! she must run positively wild!}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{forgive us, mr ferrars. my youngest is not to be found this morning. she is a little shy of strangers at present.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{naturally. i am also shy of strangers and i have nothing like her excuse.}
<C>__{marianne}
<P>__{(dangerous)}
<D>__{how do you like your view, mr ferrars?}
<A>__{elinor glances at her warningly but edward replies with careful consideration.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{very much. your stables are very handsome and beautifully kept, mrs dashwood.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{stables! edward your windows overlook the lake.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{an oversight, fanny, led me to the wrong room. i have rectified the situation and am happily settled in the guest quarters.}
<A>__{marianne and elinor look at each other in surprise. fanny looks furious. mrs dashwood smiles warmly at edward. close on elinor. she is impressed.}
<L>__{interior norland park staircase day}
<A>__{fanny is walking with edward, who looks at the pictures with interest.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{they are all exceedingly spoilt, i find. miss margaret spends all her time up trees and under furniture and i have barely had a civil word from marianne.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{my dear fanny, they have just lost their father their lives will never be the same again.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{that is no excuse.}
<L>__{interior norland park library day}
<A>__{fanny leads edward in. she sniffs with distaste.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{i have never liked the smell of books.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{oh? no. the dust, perhaps.}
<A>__{as they speak, edward notices a large atlas retreating apparently all by itself across the floor. someone is obviously under the table, pulling it out of sight. he registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to shield it from fanny. he turns back, searching for something to divert her.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i hear you have great plans for the walnut grove.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{oh yes! i shall have it pulled down to make room for a grecian temple.}
<A>__{there is a stifled wail from under the table, which edward covers with a cough.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{how picturesque. will you show me the site?}
<A>__{and he ushers fanny out, flicking a quick glance over his shoulder at the fugitive's foot.}
<L>__{interior norland park velvet room day}
<A>__{elinor, mrs dashwood and marianne are sitting round a table with a pile of letters. elinor is handing one back to her mother.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{too expensive. we do not need four bedrooms, we can share.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{this one, then?}
<A>__{elinor reads the letter quickly.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{marianne, we have only five hundred pounds a year. i will send out more inquiries today.}
<A>__{there is a knock on the door. hesitantly, edward appears.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{pardon my intrusion, but i believe i have found what you are looking for.}
<A>__{marianne and mrs dashwood are puzzled by his elliptical manner but elinor immediately understands and rises, in smiling relief.}
<L>__{interior norland park entrance hall outside library day}
<A>__{edward is standing outside keeping a discreet lookout. the door is half open and he can hear elinor trying to coax margaret out. fanny walks by with a butler to whom she is giving instructions. edward pretends to examine the mouldings and she passes on unsuspecting.}
<C>__{elinor }
<D>__{won't you come out, dearest? we haven't seen you all day. mamma is very concerned.}
<A>__{more silence. edward thinks hard. he makes a decision.}
<L>__{interior norland park library day}
<A>__{edward walks in loudly.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{oh, miss dashwood! excuse me i was wondering do you by any chance have such a thing as a reliable atlas?}
<A>__{elinor looks up at him in astonishment.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i believe so.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{excellent. i wish to check the position of the nile.}
<A>__{edward appears to be utterly sincere.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{my sister says it is in south america.}
<A>__{from under the table we hear a snort. elinor looks at him in realisation.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{oh! no, no indeed. she is quite wrong. for i believe it is in in belgium.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{belgium? surely not. you must be thinking of the volga.}
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(from under the table)}
<D>__{the volga?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{of course. the volga, which, as you know, starts in...}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{vladivostok, and ends in...}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{st albans.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{indeed. where the coffee beans come from.}
<A>__{they are having such a good time that it is rather a pity the game is stopped by the appearance from under the table of margaret who reveals herself to be a disheveled girl of eleven. she hauls the atlas up and plonks it in front of}
<B>__{edward.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{the source of the nile is in abyssinia.}

<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{margaret dashwood.}
<A>__{edward shakes margaret's hand solemnly and looks over her head at elinor. they smile at each other, a connection made.}

<A>__{john is reading a newspaper. mrs dashwood sits across from fanny, who thumbs through a fashion plate magazine. elinor is at a desk by the window writing a letter we see the words 'of course we should like to leave as soon as possible'. suddenly she hears a commotion outside. margaret runs past the window brandishing a stick. edward follows, and proceeds to teach her the first principles of sword fighting. they feint and parry, edward serious and without a hint of condescension, margaret concentrating furiously. edward suddenly turns, as though feeling elinor's gaze. she smiles but looks away quickly.}
<L>__{interior norland park velvet room another day}
<A>__{edward comes into the doorway and sees elinor who is listening to marianne playing a concerto. elinor stands in a graceful, rather sad attitude, her back to us. suddenly she senses edward behind her and turns. he is about to turn away, embarrassed to have been caught admiring her, when he sees she has been weeping. hastily she tries to dry her eyes. he comes forward and offers her a handkerchief, which she takes with a grateful smile. we notice his monogram in the corner:}

<C>__{elinor}
<P>__{(apologetic)}
<D>__{that was my father's favourite.}
<A>__{edward nods kindly.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{thank you so much for your help with margaret, mr ferrars. she is a changed girl since your arrival.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{not at all. i enjoy her company.}

<C>__{edward}
<D>__{not yet. would you do me the honour, miss dashwood? it is very fine out.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{with pleasure.}
<A>__{they start to walk out of shot, still talking.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{margaret has always wanted to travel.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i know. she is heading an expedition to china shortly. i am to go as her servant but only on the understanding that i will be very badly treated.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{what will your duties be?}

<D>__{sword fighting, administering rum and swabbing.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{ah.}

<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{as?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{she hardly knows. any fine figure will suit a great orator, a leading politician, even a barrister would serve, but only on the condition that i drive my own barouche and dine in the first circles.}
<A>__{his tone is light but there is an underlying bitterness to it.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{and what do you wish for?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i always preferred the church, but that is not smart enough for my mother she prefers the army, but that is a great deal too smart for me.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{would you stay in london?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i hate london. no peace. a country living is my ideal a small parish where i might do some good, keep chickens and give very short sermons.}

<A>__{edward nods and smiles at the irony of it.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{our circumstances are therefore precisely the same.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{except that you will inherit your fortune.}

<D>__{no voice divine the storm allayed no light propitious shone, when snatched from all effectual aid, we perished each alone: but i beneath a rougher sea, and whelmed in deeper gulfs than he.}

<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{no particular reason, marianne, only that we know so little of him }

<A>__{elinor and mrs dashwood are at the accounts. willoughby and marianne are on the other side of the room in the window seat, whispering together. clearly, he is already part of the family.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{surely you are not going to deny us beef as well as sugar?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{there is nothing under tenpence a pound. we have to economise.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{do you want us to starve?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{no. just not to eat beef.}
<A>__{mrs dashwood is silenced but sighs crossly. elinor looks over to the lovers and sees willoughby in the act of cutting off a lock of marianne's hair, which he kisses and places in his pocket book. elinor is transfixed by this strangely erotic moment. willoughby senses her gaze and looks over. she snaps her head back to her sums and is astonished to find that she has written 'edward' at the top of the sheet. hastily she rubs it out and writes 'expenses'.}
<L>__{exterior barton church. day.}
<A>__{mrs jennings is talking to the elderly curate. other parishioners exit the church as willoughby's curricle (the eighteenth century equivalent of a sports car) goes flying by. marianne sits by his side, the picture of happiness. mrs jennings nudges the curate and whispers. the parishioners stare after them and comment to each other.}
<L>__{exterior barton cottage garden path day}
<A>__{marianne and elinor are coming down the path together. marianne is dressed to go out. the argument has evidently started indoors and is being continued here.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{if there was any true impropriety in my behaviour, i should be sensible of it, elinor }
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{but as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks, do you not begin to doubt your own discretion?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{if the impertinent remarks of such as mrs jennings are proof of impropriety, then we are all offending every moment of our lives }
<A>__{the conversation is halted by the arrival of colonel brandon on horseback.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<P>__{(dismounting)}
<D>__{miss dashwood! miss marianne!}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{good morning, colonel!}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{i come to issue an invitation. a picnic on my estate at delaford if you would care to join us on thursday nexterior mrs jennings's daughter and her husband are traveling up especially.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{thank you, colonel, we shall be delighted.}
<A>__{at that moment, willoughby's curricle hoves into view and marianne's face lights up.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<P>__{(to marianne)}
<D>__{i will of course be including mr willoughby in the party.}
<A>__{even marianne is a little embarrassed and recollects her manners. she smiles kindly at brandon.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i should be delighted to join you, colonel!}
<A>__{the colonel helps her into the curricle, exchanging nods with willoughby, who is regarding him with some suspicion.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{good morning, miss dashwood; good morning, colonel.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{the colonel has invited us to delaford, willoughby!}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{excellent. i understand you have a particularly fine pianoforte, colonel.}
<A>__{the undercurrents of this conversation are decidedly tense.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{a broadwood grand.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{a broadwood grand! then i shall really be able to play for you!}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{we shall look forward to it!}
<A>__{marianne smiles her perfect happiness at him and he whips up the horses. they drive off, waving their farewells. brandon looks after them for a silent moment, and then collects himself and turns to elinor, who is less than satisfied with their behaviour.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{your sister seems very happy.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{yes. marianne does not approve of hiding her emotions. in fact, her romantic prejudices have the unfortunate tendency to set propriety at naught.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{she is wholly unspoilt.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{rather too unspoilt, in my view. the sooner she becomes acquainted with the ways of the world, the better.}
<A>__{colonel brandon looks at her sharply and then speaks very deliberately, as though controlling some powerful emotion.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{i knew a lady like your sister the same impulsive sweetness of temper who was forced into, as you put it, a better acquaintance with the world. the result was only ruination and despair.}
<A>__{he stops, and briskly remounts his horse.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{do not desire it, miss dashwood.}
<L>__{exterior barton park drive day}
<A>__{people and carriages fill the drive, the sun shines and the atmosphere is pleasantly expectant. sir john is organising the provision of blankets and parasols and colonel brandon is busy furnishing the drivers with their routes. there are three new faces a pretty, blowsy woman (charlotte palmer), a stony faced man (mr palmer) and an exceedingly good looking girl (lucy steele), who are standing with elinor, marianne, margaret, mrs jennings and mrs dashwood. marianne is standing slightly apart, looking out along the road, impatient for willoughby.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{imagine my surprise, mrs dashwood, when charlotte and her lord and master appeared with our cousin lucy! the last person i expected to see! 'where did you pop out from, miss?' says i. i was never so surprised to see anyone in all my life!}
<A>__{lucy steele smiles shyly and looks at the ground. mrs jennings continues sotto voce to mrs dashwood.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{she probably came on purpose to share the fun, for there are no funds for such luxuries at home, poor thing.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i had not seen you for so long, dear mrs jennings, i could not resist the opportunity.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{oh, you sly thing! it was the misses dashwood she wanted to see, not delaford, mamma! i have heard nothing but 'miss dashwood this, miss dashwood that' for i don't know how long! and what do you think of them now you do see them, lucy? my mother has talked of nothing else in her letters since you came to barton, mrs dashwood. mr palmer are they not the very creatures she describes?}
<A>__{mr palmer regards his wife with a less than enchanted expression.}
<C>__{mr palmer}
<D>__{nothing like.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(laughing gaily)}
<D>__{why, mr palmer! do you know you are quite rude today? he is to be an mp, you know, mrs dashwood, and it is very fatiguing for him for he is forced to make everybody like him he says it is quite shocking }
<C>__{mrs palmer}
<D>__{i never said anything so irrational. don't palm all your abuses of the language upon me.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<P>__{(to mrs dashwood)}
<D>__{mr palmer is so droll he is always out of humour.}
<A>__{mr palmer does indeed have the air of a man under siege. willough by suddenly appears in his curricle. marianne waves to him with a radiant smile. mrs jennings nudges charlotte and points to marianne.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{here he is! now you shall see, charlotte.}
<A>__{willoughby drives up as close to marianne as possible, making her laugh.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{how now, mr willoughby! you must greet my daughter charlotte, and mr palmer }
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{how do you do?}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{and my little cousin, miss lucy steele.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{welcome to our party, miss steele!}
<A>__{lucy bobs demurely. willoughby inclines his head politely, leaps from the curricle and hands marianne in. mrs jennings coos and chuckles at them. charlotte nudges elinor.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i know mr willoughby extremely well not that i ever spoke to him but i have seen him forever in town. your sister is monstrous lucky to get him. mamma says colonel brandon is in love with her as well, which is a very great compliment for he hardly ever falls in love with anyone.}
<A>__{elinor smiles politely. willoughby moves the curricle out to the front of the drive. charlotte points after them and laughs with mrs jennings. lucy edges up beside elinor.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{may i beg a seat beside you, miss dashwood? i have so longed to make your better acquaintance! i have heard nothing but the highest praise for you.}
<A>__{elinor is relieved to change the subject.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i would be delighted. but sir john and mrs jennings are too excessive in their compliments. i am sure to disappointerior}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{no, for it was from quite another source that i heard you praised and one not at all inclined to exaggeration.}
<A>__{lucy speaks in a knowing, confidential undertone, as though not wanting anyone else to hear. at that moment a horseman thunders up the drive towards them. everyone turns to face the new arrival.}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{what can this be?}
<A>__{it is a messenger who has obviously had a long, hard ride. he asks for colonel brandon and hands him a letter, which brandon tears open. mrs jennings is puce with suppressed curiosity.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{my horse! quickly!}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{what is the matter, brandon?}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{i must away to london.}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{no! impossible!}
<A>__{everyone gathers round brandon, who is, naturally, mortified. a servant brings up the colonel's horse.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{imperative.}
<A>__{there is a murmur of disappointment from the party. sir john is embarrassed and protests again.}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{but brandon, we are all assembled. we cannot picnic at delaford without our host! go up to town tomorrow.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{or wait till we return and start then you would not be six hours later.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{i cannot afford to lose one minute.}
<A>__{as he speaks, he is mounting his horse. his grave urgency silences all protest and he gallops off, leaving everyone stunned and, of course, deeply curious. then they all start to talk at once. lucy is still next to elinor.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oh, miss dashwood, i cannot bear it! just when i was to have the opportunity of speaking with you.}
<L>__{exterior meadow near barton cottage day}
<A>__{having been denied their trip, the dashwoods and willoughby have set out an impromptu picnic. willoughby is wandering restlessly about. the weather is sublime.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{frailty, thy name is brandon!}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{there are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. i think he wrote the letter himself as a trick for getting out of it.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<P>__{(indulgently)}
<D>__{you are a very wicked pair, colonel brandon will be sadly missed.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{why? when he is the kind of man that everyone speaks well of and no one wants to talk to.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{exactly!}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{nonsense.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{colonel brandon is very highly esteemed at the park.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{which is enough censure in itself.}

<C>__{willoughby}
<P>__{(imitating mrs jennings perfectly)}
<D>__{come, come, mr impudence i know you and your wicked ways oh!}
<A>__{he gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing her walk. he comes up to elinor and puts his head on her shoulder.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{come, miss dashwood, reveal your beau, reveal him, i say! let's have no secrets between friends! let me winkle them out of you!}
<A>__{elinor hits him on the nose with her teaspoon and he waddles off to marianne.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<P>__{(as mrs jennings)}
<D>__{i declare, miss marianne, if i do not have you married to the colonel by teatime, i shall swallow my own bonnet.}
<A>__{marianne laughs. willoughby drops the parody suddenly.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{as if you could marry such a character.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{why should you dislike him?}
<A>__{there is indeed an edge to willoughby's raillery. he flicks elinor an almost alarmed glance and then sweeps marianne to her feet and starts to dance around the garden with her.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{because he has threatened me with rain when i wanted it fine, he has found fault with the balance of my curricle and i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare. if it will be of any satisfaction to you, however, to be told i believe his character to be in all other respects irreproachable, i am ready to confess it. and in return for an acknowledgement that must give me some pain.}
<P>__{(he is slowing down)}
<D>__{you cannot deny me the privilege...}
<P>__{(slower still)}
<D>__{of disliking him...}
<P>__{(and stopping)}
<D>__{as much as i adore...}
<A>__{he and marianne are standing looking at each other. the expression on willoughby's face is heart stopping. margaret has stopped eating and is staring with her mouth open. elinor glances at mrs dashwood but she is gazing up at them with almost as many stars in her eyes as marianne. suddenly willoughby breaks the mood by swinging away from marianne and gesturing to the house.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{ this cottage!}
<A>__{the tension is broken. margaret starts to chew again.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{i have great plans for improvements to it, you know, mr willoughby.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{now that i will never consent to. not a stone must be added to its walls. were i rich enough, i would instantly pull down combe magna and build it up again in the exact image of that cottage!}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{with dark, narrow stairs, a poky hall and a fire that smokes?}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{especially the fire that smokes! then i might be as happy at combe magna as i have been at barton.}
<A>__{he looks at marianne, who has gone to sit at her mother's feet.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{but this place has one claim on my affection which no other can possibly share.}
<A>__{marianne is so irradiated with happiness that she looks like an angel.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{promise me you will never change it.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{i do not have the heart.}

<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{willoughby, we are always alone!}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{but there is something very particular i should like to ask you.}
<A>__{there is something about his formal tone that makes her feel shy.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{of course. i shall ask mamma if i may stay behind from church.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{thank you. until tomorrow then miss marianne.}

<A>__{he enters a bare room partitioned with filthy rags hung from the ceiling and lit with stinking tallow lamps. at the window stands the slight figure of a very young woman. she turns. brandon reacts with a tender smile which stiffens into an expression of deep shock. we see her silhouette. she is heavily pregnant. she bursts into tears and runs into his arms.}

<A>__{he takes her hand somewhat confusedly and accepts her offer of a seat. there is an awful silence. marianne tries to help.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i hope you have left mrs ferrars well?}

<D>__{tolerably, thank you.}

<D>__{is mrs ferrars at the new parish?}
<A>__{edward looks extremely confused.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{no my mother is in town.}
<A>__{he plucks up the courage to look at elinor again and is evidently not much comforted by what he sees.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{i meant to enquire after mrs edward ferrars.}
<A>__{edward colours. he hesitates.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{then you have not heard the news i think you mean my brother you mean mrs robert ferrars.}
<A>__{they all stare at him in shock.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{mrs robert ferrars?}
<A>__{elinor has frozen. edward rises and goes to the window.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{yes. i received a letter from miss steele or mrs ferrars, i should say communicating the... the transfer of her affections to my brother robert. they were much thrown together in london, i believe, and... and in view of the change in my circumstances, i felt it only fair that miss steele be released from our engagement. at any rate, they were married last week and are now in plymouth.}
<A>__{elinor rises suddenly, edward turns and they stand looking at one another.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{then you are not married.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{elinor bursts into tears. the shock of this emotional explosion stuns everyone for a second and then marianne makes an executive decision. wordlessly, she takes margaret's hand and leads her and mrs dashwood out of the room.}

<C>__{edward}
<D>__{elinor! i met lucy when i was very young. had i had an active profession, i should never have felt such an idle, foolish inclination. at norland my behaviour was very wrong. but i convinced myself you felt only friendship for me and it was my heart alone that i was risking. i have come with no expectations. only to profess, now that i am at liberty to do so, that my heart is and always will be yours.}

<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{your mother, i suppose, will hardly be less angry with robert for marrying lucy.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{the more so since she settled the money upon him so irrevocably }
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{ no doubt because she had run out of sons to disinherit.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{her family fluctuates at an alarming rate. then, in london, when you told me of the colonel's offer, i became convinced that you wanted me to marry lucy and that well, that you and colonel brandon...}

<D>__{me and colonel brandon!}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i shall not forget attempting to thank him for making it possible for me to marry the woman i did not love while convinced he had designs upon the woman i did do love.}

<A>__{a large wedding party is gathered outside the church. the entire village is present children, farmers, labourers, shopkeepers, and all our principals. we see mrs jennings in a gigantic mauve bonnet, charlotte and mr palmer, sir john, mrs dashwood, margaret, thomas, john and fanny, who is dressed in a fantastically inappropriate concoction, and some men in regimental uniform. the path to the church is strewn with wild flowers and everyone holds a bunch of their own. the church bells start to peal, and a great cheer goes up as the door opens and betsy comes out holding the bridal cake aloft. the bride and groom appear: marianne, in white lawn, and colonel brandon in full uniform. behind them come edward in his parson's garb and, on his arm, elinor as matron of honour. close on them as they watch the party moving away. marianne and brandon make their way forwards, everyone throws their flowers over them, whooping and singing. an open carriage decked with bridal wreaths comes to meet them, and brandon lifts marianne in. his melancholy air is all but gone and he radiates joyful life and vigour. marianne also looks extremely happy but there is a gravity to her joy that makes her seem much older. according to the custom of the time, brandon throws a large handful of six pences into the crowd, and the village children jump and dive for them. the coins spin and bounce, catching the sun like jewels. one hits fanny in the eye. she reels and falls over backwards into a gorse bush. cam pulls back as the wedding procession makes its glorious way from the church. we draw away into the surrounding countryside. then we see, on the far edge of frame, very small, a man sitting on a white horse, watching. it is willoughby. as we draw back further still, he slowly pulls the horse around and moves off in the opposite direction.}
