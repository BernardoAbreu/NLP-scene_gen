<A>__{the captain and the science officers stare through the plexi dome and out into the freezing, cobalt blue of the palawan trough. the music intensifies as they round each curve. then, dead ahead, is the end of the trough, which is half blocked by a rock encrusted embankment. the music builds. the shinkai approaches the embankment. slowly starts to glide up the side. the captain and science officers seem mesmerized by all the lonely creepiness. they crest the embankment. and the plexi domed view fills with an unimaginable horror. as far as the eye can see, the entire murky landscape is filled with whale bones. a valley of death. cluttered here and there, carelessly flung about, are the rusting hulks of several ships. seemingly ripped apart. clusters of shark cartilage float through the water like white ghosts. the captain, the science officers and the entire crew just stare, frozen in place by the strange horror before them.}
