<L>__{exterior hospital next morning}
<A>__{sam, holding the baby, and becca, having just checked out, walk down the steps of the hospital holding their complimentary plastic baby bag. sam is nervous haling the precious cargo and becca is agitated. they see the bus pulling up and down the street and sam moves quickly so they can hurry and catch it. as he approaches the bus, he looks to becca by his side, but she is not there. he looks around and no sign of her. frantically turning in a full circle, he sees the fabric of her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street. he screams.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{becca! becca!}
<A>__{the more he screams the faster she moves away. till there's no trace of her. sam stands in the middle of the busy block holding lucy to his chest, devastated. we hear, "look for the girl with the clouds in her eyes, but she's gone."}
