<D>__{you see, karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. he couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. but, his father made sure that his mother knew what the bible said. and she made sure karl knew. you know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?}
