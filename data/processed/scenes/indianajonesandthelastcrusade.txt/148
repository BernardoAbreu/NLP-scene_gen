<P>__{(to indy)}
<D>__{where's marcus?!}
<A>__{before indy can answer, vogel is up and swinging with the shovel. indy ducks but the shovel catches henry sending him over the side and onto the moving tread. indy grabs his whip, knocking vogel aside. as henry speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, indy, with lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around henry's right ankle.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{dad!}
<A>__{henry is bouncing across the treads like a rag doll. indy struggles to hold onto the end of the bullwhip.}

<C>__{sallah}
<D>__{give me your hand!}
<A>__{sallah manages to hold onto henry as he brings his horse to a stop just at the cliff's edge. indy finally frees himself of vogel's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away from indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to vogel's head.}
<B>__{indy}
<A>__{looks down at the fast approaching cliff, his face filled with horror. we see his hat blow off and sail over the cliff's edge.}

<B>__{long shot}
