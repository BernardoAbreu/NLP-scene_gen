<T>__{dissolve back to:}
<L>__{exterior asphalt night}
<A>__{as the gasoline continues to burn, the rowboat gone. adjust to find rennie's face, the flames of the car wreckage flickering over her glassy eyes. she looks up at miss van deusen's body one last time before: angle squad car (efx) the auto's fuel tank explodes, shrapnel flying}
<B>__{everywhere.}
<L>__{exterior alley #4 continuous}
<A>__{she looks up at her uncle with knowing eyes. eyes that tell him she's remembered everything.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{you pushed me...}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{i was only trying to teach you. but i pulled you out, rennie. i saved your life.}
<A>__{rennie just stares, incredulous.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{you son of a bitch...}
<A>__{she lets it build until she's ready to explode...then:}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{he was down there!!!}
<A>__{and rennie runs off. mcculloch starts to follow but sean grabs him, shoving him down.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{you keep away from her!}
<A>__{sean chases after rennie. camera methodically pans back to mcculloch, crumpled on the ground. a very bitter man. he wipes his hands, getting ready to stand when the shadow falls over him. his skin fades to porcelain white.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{you...are...not possible.}
<A>__{but possible, and actual, he is. a pair of rotted arms}
