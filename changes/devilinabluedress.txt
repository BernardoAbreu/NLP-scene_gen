<DIAL>__{The men might get to thinkin' that I'm weak if I take you back.}
<ACTION>__{The cup rises to the face of BENNY GIACOMO, late forties, with salt and pepper hair that was once jet black. Skin darker than a Louisiana Creole. He takes a sip and bares his teeth in a grimace from the whiskey. As he talks we gradually see more of him -- feet kicked up on the desk, fully in charge. A Betty Grable like pin-up girl is giving us background in more ways than one in a swimsuit and high heels on a calendar tacked to the wall: May, 1948.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing)}
<DIAL>__{And I didn't tell Dupree that I'd give you your job back... All I said was that I'd be glad to talk to you if you said the right thing... Do you have something to say?}

<CHAR>__{MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mr. Giacomo, when one of the white guys has come off a double shift and says he's too tired to work overtime, you don't fire him.}

<DIAL>__{Fella, what'd I tell ya? If you're not willing to give a little extra, Champion can't use you.}
<ACTION>__{EASY RAWLINS, thirty, handsome and a much darker brown than Giacomo, takes a drag off a Chesterfield cigarette. Through the window behind him, a team of men pour over a partly assembled airplane, their voices echoing in the hangar that surrounds the office. Benny measures out his words one at a time.}
<CHAR>__{BENNY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.S.)}
<DIAL>__{Now... Do... you... have... something... to say?}

<DIAL>__{S'cuse me, Ezekiel.}

<ACTION>__{Black and grey cars, Packards and Buicks from 1928 to 1948, come and go on Central Avenue. Two-storied storefronts with canvas awnings, above black men and women in hats... all in a hurry. The Red Car rumbles through and then a white Cadillac convertible pulls to the curb in front of a butcher shop. Above the shop on the next floor are large partly open windows with JOPPY'S BAR in boldface letters. Inside sits Easy, back to the window reading the classified ads.}
<LOC>__{INT. JOPPY'S BAR}
<ACTION>__{T-Bone Walker's "Westside Baby" plays on the jukebox as Easy takes a final drag off his cigarette and stubs it out. THE FRONT PAGE of the LOS ANGELES TIMES lies face up on the table beneath the ashtray displaying A PHOTOGRAPH of a middle-aged white man and his pretty young woman companion smiling and waving. Above the happy couple is a headline "CARTER DROPS OUT OF RACE"... The caption under the photo reads "Wealthy civic leader, Todd Carter, shown here with his lovely bride-to-be, Daphne Monet, at a fundraiser last month was unavailable for comment on his surprising withdrawal from the Mayor's race."}

<DIAL>__{Hey, watch the marble!   Dammit, what'd I tell you?}
<ACTION>__{The fifty-year-old burly bartender leans over his big stomach checking for cracks and buffing the veiny marble top of the bar with a filthy rag. Behind him is a yellow billboard from 1932 with big black letters reading "Fuller vs. Shag. 10 ROUND MAIN EVENT." We could make out more of the poster and the eight-by-ten framed boxing photos around it if it wasn't so smoky in the place.}

<ACTION>__{His words hang as his eyes stray toward the door. Easy looks up also at THE DOORWAY which fills with the large frame of the white MAN in an off-white linen suit, his pale eyes surveying the room. Satisfied that all but two of the six tables in the tiny room are unoccupied, he smiles at Joppy and walks to the far end of the bar. Easy is surprised to see Joppy, tough ex-heavyweight that he is, duck his head and smile as he makes his way over like he's answering a summons. The white man extends a friendly hand and the two of them shake like old friends and lean in close to talk in private. Easy finds it hard not to watch their conversation as he takes a sip from a short glass of bourbon on the rocks. After a moment...}

<CHAR>__{JOPPY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I didn't say that... But if there's a dollar laying in the street I don't think he'll let a little dirt stop him from picking it up. If you worried about making that house note this month, maybe you wanna pay him a call. All them pretty girls you be with ain't gonna buy you a house.}

But at the moment I was wondering if there was any such thing as a sprained chin. But other than that and a headache, a loose tooth and a kidney that a doctor would need to look at, I felt like five thousand, three hundred dollars... And unless Albright was alive somewhere, that feelin' was gonna last a while.}
