<L>__{interior miles's apartment evening}
<A>__{miles enters his tiny apartment. he loosens his tie and puts down his satchel. on his way to the kitchen, he presses a button on his answering machine. as it plays, he opens the refrigerator and looks inside.}
<C>__{answering machine}
<D>__{one new message.}
<C>__{maya's voice}
<D>__{hello, miles. it's maya.}
<A>__{miles freezes, not wanting to miss a single syllable.}
<C>__{maya's voice}
<D>__{thanks for your letter. i would have called you sooner, but i think i've needed some time to think about everything that happened and what you wrote to me. another reason i didn't call sooner is that i wanted to finish your book, which i finally did last night.}
<A>__{miles's heart pounds.}
<C>__{maya's voice}
<D>__{i think it's really lovely, miles. you're so good with words. who cares if it's not getting published? there are so many beautiful and painful things about it. did you really go through all that? it must have been awfully hard. and the sister character jesus, what a wreck. but i have to say i was really confused by the ending. did the father finally commit suicide, or what? it's driving me crazy. and the title.}
