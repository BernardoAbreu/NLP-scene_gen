<L>__{interior lab night}
<A>__{someone kicks the door shut. now the figures are in silhouette, lit by the light in the office. and then the light goes out.}
<L>__{exterior fedex offices next morning}
<A>__{a nondescript office park near the airport. no sign. chuck's car screeches into the parking lot. he jumps out, glances at this watch, and heads for the building at a run.}
<L>__{interior executive conference room moments later}
<A>__{a large room dominated by an animated map of the world. lights at various locations blink and flash. above the map are a large sign saying "here today, gone tomorrow" and two huge digital clocks one keeping time, the other a countdown clock for that day's package sort at the superhub. the operations team of fedex sits around a large table. each has on a headset. becca twigg, the business like senior vice president of operations, addresses questions to a man colin parker bowles, the european operations manager on a large tv screen in front of her. "london" is superimposed on the screen.}
<C>__{becca}
<D>__{so why was milan late, colin?}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{one of the race horses coming from ireland got colic and had to be off loaded in brussels. that put the jumbo 15, six hours late into charles de gaulle. customs had difficulty locating the dutiable items...}
<A>__{colin continues as chuck, out of breath, slips under the screen and heads for the one remaining vacant seat across from stan. next to stan is maynard graham, an mba systems man. becca addresses a question over to stan.}
<C>__{becca}
<D>__{stan, can we get p&a down to work with milan customs?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{we're already on it.}
<C>__{becca}
<D>__{good. and let's look at our live animal policy. i don't think the income stream justifies delaying ip product, especially at christmas.}
<A>__{colin disappears. a red light goes on. becca pushes a button. another face comes on the screen. "oakland" appears under the face.}
<C>__{becca}
<D>__{stand by, benson, we're still wrapping up foreign.}
<A>__{she turns pointedly to chuck.}
<C>__{becca}
<D>__{chuck, thanks for joining us. status?}
<A>__{chuck swallows nervously, tries to talk matter of factly.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{becca, as you know st. petersburg was consistently running late by six to ten hours sometimes a full day or more. i replaced the station manager. we identified inefficiencies and worked out a quality improvement plan i believe can be met.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{you replaced the station manager with a driver. a local with no knowledge of our systems.}
<C>__{becca}
<D>__{shouldn't you have brought in someone from memphis? russia is priority one.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{james pottinger is available.}
<A>__{the process is being ripped out of chuck's hands. he struggles to get an answer.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{he's a numbers cruncher. chuck's done all the right things here...}
<A>__{stan is doing his best to back up chuck.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{jim's a terrific financial man, no question. but we can't always parachute in from memphis. we've got to build up our local staff.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{we've got to improve foreign on time, that's what we've got to do. if this new guy's so good, how come the very first plane he sent missed the connection in paris?}
<A>__{maynard knows how to go for the jugular. everyone looks at chuck.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{we're building a new team here. we got every package on the truck for the first time ever. success is the best teacher.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{i don't call missing the plane a success.}
<A>__{everyone looks at chuck.}
