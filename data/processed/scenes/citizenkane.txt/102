<A>__{as camera pulls back over shoulder of official, taking in kane, leland, and bernstein, we see the bustle and noise of departing ocean liner. behind the principles can be seen an enormous plain sign which reads: "first class." from offstage can be heard the steward's cry, indispensable in any mercury production, the old familiar cry, "all ashore that's going ashore!" gongs, also blasts of the great whistle and all the rest of it.}
<C>__{the official}
<D>__{there you are, mr. kane. everything in order.}
