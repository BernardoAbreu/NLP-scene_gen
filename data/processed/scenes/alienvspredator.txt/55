<L>__{exterior mouth of the tunnel continuous}
<A>__{quinn stumbles through the whiteout. suddenly he runs straight into something. looks up in shock to see a dead body. what's left of klaus. after that, quinn sees three more bodies. all strung up by their ankles. swaying in the wind. quinn's entire team is dead. half buried in the snow, quinn sees klaus' gun. he reaches for it, but as he brings up the desert eagle from nowhere a predator appears! the predator knocks the gun out of quinn's hand. we prepare for a fight between the predator and the one man who can probably fight a predator. quinn finds a pipe buried in the snow and picks it up. he charges the predator and swings at him but the predator swats it away as if it were a toy and backhands quinn in the chest. quinn goes down hard. he is stunned by the predator's power. quinn won't surrender. he starts to pick himself up but as he does the predator steps on his leg, snapping it in half like a piece of wood resting on two rocks. quinn screams in pain. the predator kicks him in the ribs, sending him into the air and down the mouth of the tunnel! quinn screams as he continues to fall!}
