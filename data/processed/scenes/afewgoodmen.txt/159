<D>__{thank you, sir, would you have a seat, please.}
<A>__{jessep sits.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{colonel, when you learned of santiago's letter to the nis, you had a meeting with your two senior officers, is that right?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{the executive officer, lt. jonathan kendrick, and the company commander, captain matthew markinson.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{and at present, captain markinson is dead, is that right?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{objection. i'd like to know just what defense counsel is implying?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i'm implying simply that, at present, captain markinson is not alive.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{surely colonel jessep doesn't need to appear in this courtroom to confirm that information.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i just wasn't sure if the witness was aware that two days ago, captain markinson took his own life with a .45 caliber pistol.}
<A>__{and from the back of the room, sam enters. he's escorting two young airmen in airforce dress uniforms. sam shows the airmen to a seat near the front, and takes his place at the defense table. over this we hear }
<C>__{randolph }
<D>__{the witness is aware, the court is aware, and now the jury is aware. we thank you for bringing this to our attention. move on lieutenant.}
<A>__{sam scribbles something on a piece of paper, kaffee walks over, looks at the paper on which are wrttten two names: cecil o'malley and anthony perez, then turns back to randolph.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{yes sir. colonel, at the time of this meeting, you gave lt. kendrick an order, is that right?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{i told kendrick to tell his men that santiago wasn't to be touched.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{and did you give an order to captain markinson as well?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{i ordered markinson to have santiago transferred off the base immediately.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{i felt that his life might be in danger once word of the letter got out.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{grave danger?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{is there another kind?}
<A>__{kaffee holds up a document from his table.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{we have the transfer order that you and markinson co signed, ordering that santiago be lifted on a flight leaving guantanamo at six the next morning. was that the first flight off the bass?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{the six a.m. flight was the first flight off the base.}
<A>__{kaffee nods and decides to move on. jessep steals a quick glance at the two airmen sitting out in the courtroom.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{colonel, you flew up to washington early this morning, is that right?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{yes.}

<C>__{ross}
<D>__{please the court, is this dialogue relevant to anything in particular?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{the defense didn't have an opportunity to depose this witness, your honor. i'd ask the court for a little latitude.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{a very little latitude.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{colonel?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{i wore fatigues on the plane.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{and you brought your dress uniform with you.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{and a toothbrush? a shaving kit? change of underwear?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{your honor.}
<C>__{kaffee}

<D>__{you better get somewhere fast with this, lieutenant.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{yes sir. colonel?}

<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{lt. kaffee, i have to }
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i'm wondering why santiago wasn't packed.}
<A>__{that landed. on the jury, randolph, ross...}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i will tell you what, we'll get back to that one in a minute.}
<A>__{jo hands kaffee the computer printout.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this is a record of all telephone calls made from your base in the past 24 hours. after being subpoenaed to washington, you made three calls.}
<A>__{handing jessep the printout }
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i've highlighted those calls in yellow. do you recognize those numbers?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{i called colonel fitzhuqhes in quantico, va. i wanted to let him know i'd be in town. the second call was to set up a meeting with congressman ramond of the house armed services committee, and the third call was to my sister elizabeth.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{why did you make that call, sir?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{i thought she might like to have dinner tonight.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{judge }
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{i'm gonna put a stop to this now.}
<A>__{jo's handed kaffee another printout and a stack of letters.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{your honor, these are the telephone records from gitmo for august 6th. and these are 14 letters that santiago wrote in nine months requesting, in fact begging, for a transfer.}
<P>__{(to jessep)}
<D>__{upon hearing the news that he was finally getting his transfer, santiago was so excited, that do you know how many people he called? zero. nobody. not one call to his parents saying he was coming home. not one call to a friend saying can you pick me up at the airport. he was asleep in his bed at midnight, and according to you he was getting on a plane in six hours, yet everything he owned was hanging neatly in his closet and folded neatly in his footlocker. you were leaving for one day and you packed a bag and made three phone calls. santiago was leaving for the rest of his life, and he hadn't called a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. can you explain that? the fact is there was no transfer order. santiago wasn't going anywhere, isn't that right, colonel.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{object. your honor, it's obvious that lt. kaffee's intention this morning is to smear a high ranking marine officer in the desperate hope that the mere appearance of impropriety will win him points with the jury. it's my recommendation, sir, that lt. kaffee receive an official reprimand from the bench, and that the witness be excused with the court's deepest apologies.}
<A>__{randolph ponders this a moment.}
<C>__{randolph}
<P>__{(pause)}

<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{is this funny, sir?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{no. it's not. it's tragic.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{do you have an answer?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{absolutely. my answer is i don't have the first damn clue. maybe he was an early morning riser and he liked to pack in the nq. and maybe he didn't have any friends. i'm an educated man, but i'm afraid i can't speak intelligently about the travel habits of william santiago. what i do know is that he was set to leave the base at 0600. now are these really the questions i was called here to answer? phone calls and footlockers? please tell me you've got something more, lieutenant. please tell me there's an ace up your sleeve. these two marines are on trial for their lives. please tell me their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do you have any other questions for me, counselor?}
<A>__{the courtroom is silenced. jessep's slammed the door. kaffee looks around the room, sees that the world is waiting for him to do something...}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{lt. kaffee?}

<C>__{randolph}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{lieutenant, do you have anything further for this witness?}
<A>__{kaffee doesn't respond. jessep gets up to leave.}

<D>__{thanks, danny. i love washington.}

<P>__{(to randolph)}
<D>__{i'd appreciate it if he addressed me as colonel or sir. i believe i've earned it.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{defense counsel will address the witness as colonel or sir.}
<C>__{jessep}
<P>__{(to randolph)}
<D>__{i don't know what the hell kind of an outfit you're running here.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{and the witness will address this court as judge or your honor. i'm quite certain i've earned it. take your seat, colonel.}
<A>__{jessep goes back to the stand.}
<C>__{jessep}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what would you like to discuss now! my favorite color?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{colonel, the six a.m. flight, was the first one off the base?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{there wasn't a flight that left seven hours earlier and landed at andrews airforce base at 2 a.m.?}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{lieutenant, i think we've covered this, haven't we?}
<A>__{kaffee gets the two log books from his table as well as the piece of paper that sam scribbled on.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{your honor, these are the tower chief's logs for both guantanamo bay and andrews airforce base. the guantanamo log lists no flight that left at eleven p.m., and the andrews log lists no flight that landed at 2 a.m. i'd like to admit them as defense exhibits "a" and "b".}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{i don't understand. you're admitting evidence of a flight that never existed?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{we believe it did, sir.}
<P>__{(glancing at the paper,}
<D>__{then motioning to}
<P>__{the airmen)}
<D>__{defense'll be calling airman cecil o'malley and airman anthony perez. they were working the ground crew at andrews at two a.m. on the seventh.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{your honor, these men weren't on the list. rebuttal witnesses, your honor, called specifically to refute testimony offered under direct examination.}
<A>__{if you looked closely at jessep, you could see a drop of sweat.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{i will allow the witnesses.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{this is ridiculous.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{colonel, a moment ago }
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{check the tower logs for christ's sake.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{we'll get to the airmen in just a minute, sir. a moment ago said that you ordered kendrick to order his men not to touch santiago.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{and kendrick was clear on what you wanted?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{crystal.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{any chance kendrick ignored the order?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{ignored the order?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{any chance he just forgot about it?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{any chance kendrick left your office and said, "the 'old man's wrong"?}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{when kendrick spoke to the platoon and ordered them not to touch santiago, any chance they ignored him?}

<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing; beat)}
<D>__{colonel, i have just one more question before i call airman o'malley and airman perez: if you gave an order that santiago wasn't to be touched, and your orders are always followed, then why would he be in danger, why would it be necessary to transfer him off the base?}
<A>__{and jessep has no answer. nothing. he sits there, and for the first time, seems to be lost.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{private santiago was a sub standard marine. he was being transferred off the base because }
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{but that's not what you said. you said he was being transferred because he was in grave danger.}
<C>__{jessep}
<P>__{(pause)}

<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{you said, "he was in danger". i said, "grave danger". you said }

<D>__{why did you }
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{sometimes men take matters into their own hands.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{no sir. you made it clear just a moment ago that your men never take matters into their own hands. your men follow orders or people die. so santiago shouldn't have been in any danger at all, should he have, colonel?}
<A>__{everyone's sweating now. everyone but kaffee.}

<D>__{the court'll wait for answer.}
<C>__{kaffee}
