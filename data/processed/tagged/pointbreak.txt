<C>__{point break}
<D>__{by james cameron & kathryn bigelow from the screenplay by w. peter iliff}
<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{we are in the belly of a wave. light refracts in a constant collision of water. slow motion, the hallucinatory prisms, like liquid diamonds taking flight, dreamlike...}
<L>__{exterior ocean dusk}
<A>__{backlit against a flaming sun a solitary surfer glides across the green glassy peak. time is stretched until his movements gain a grace and fluidity not of this world. total zen concentration. body weight centered, eyes forward and on the next section.}
<L>__{exterior urban street dusk}
<A>__{slow motion on a black sedan. creeping along store fronts. past a winchell's. people splash steps down rain washed sidewalks in dream motion. the sedan turns past the first virginia bank and into an alley.}
<L>__{interior black sedan}
<A>__{two men and one woman in suspended time put on overcoats and hats. under their hats strips of scotch tape stretch taut from the base of their nose to their forehead, hideously distorting their features. makes them look like human pigs.}
<L>__{exterior ocean}
<A>__{silvery in this light, almost metallic, as if from some future scape. the lone surfer shreds a long, endless right wall. accelerating into real time as he stares into the pit, digs in, drops into the sweet spot on the wave, hunkers down. his moves becoming aggressive, frenzied }
<L>__{interior black sedan}
<A>__{an m 16 clip is smacked into place and cocked with a cachack! ammo clips are snick snicked into handgun butts and a long clip is sssnicked into an uzi. watches are checked. the pig nose people nod to each other.}
<L>__{exterior bank}
<A>__{pig nose #1, steals into position near the glass doors, slams his back to the wall, weapon to cheek, breath fast.}
<L>__{exterior ocean}
<A>__{fast now the surfboard rips a brutal gash in the face of the wave. the surfer trims down the line, pivoting the board and going straight down, carving the bottom. he slashes viciously back toward the lip and in a radical inverted air attack sails six feet above the wave in an explosion of water }
<L>__{interior bank}
<A>__{ baaaaaammm! glass doors explode open and pig nose #1 spins inside. he fires a burst into the ceiling. brraamm!!}
<D>__{pig nose #1 everybody on the floor!}
<A>__{people drop. very fast here two bandits handle bank employees and customers another pig nose watches the door pig nose #1 moves behind counter, uzi and canvas sack in hand.}
<L>__{interior surveillance van}
<A>__{dark. monitors show slow scans of the bank interior. two men wear headphones and black windbreakers with fbi stenciled on the back. one watches with binoculars.}
<C>__{binoculars}
<D>__{bingo. we're on. let's go. where's the big college quarterback?! are you with us, utah?}
<L>__{exterior bank wall}
<A>__{a man in his twenties. his head spins revealing rain slicked hair and face, eyes wide, bright. an edgy handsomeness to him. he pops a stick of wrigley's in his mouth, rests a shotgun on one leg and leans against the wall. he wears a headset... through which we hear the fbi guy yelling for him. this is johnny utah.}
<C>__{binoculars }
<D>__{utah, where the hell are ya!?}
<A>__{utah takes his headset off...}
<L>__{interior bank}
<A>__{pig nose #1 leaps over the counter, holds a canvas sack filled with booty from tellers' drawers.}
<D>__{pig nose #1 fuckin' shake it!}
<A>__{pig nose #2 nods with his snubby nose, hurries toward the exit.}
<L>__{exterior first virginia bank}
<A>__{the bandits burst through the doors and sprint to the alley where they jump into the sedan. the driver, the woman pig nose, punches it and the tires whirrr on the slick pavement. the sedan launches down the alley. utah running. like a freight train. splashing through a cross alley. he doesn't break stride as he slams his shoulder into a large, steel garbage dumpster. driving it like a football training sled into the alley where the sedan locks 'em up seconds too late as it skids and slams into it, crunching into the brick wall and still alive grinds into reverse back down the alley, headlights smashed, it guns it backward as utah leaps over the dumpster and sprints after the car. he has a brick in his right hand. he cocks it back. johnny heaves the brick thirty yards and smash! the brick explodes into the windshield, spiderwebbing the glass. lady pignose flinches from the glass fragments thrown into her face.}
<C>__{lady pignose}
<D>__{son of a bitch!}
<A>__{the car slews backward onto the street, slamming a parked car. lady pignose slams the thing into drive, cuts the wheel hard, and punches it, skidding on wet pavement. utah hurtles from the alley. he leaps, somehow tackles the driver's door handle and is dragged along the street. he pulls himself up, reaches inside the window, and whips the steering wheel hard right. the sedan fishtails into a parked toyota. utah bounces forward, slamming into the asphalt. glass shards and crushed steel are strewn everywhere, as radiator steam whistles hot. pig nose #2, riding shotgun, is trapped. can't get his crushed door open. the driver pushes open her door. gropes for her pistol. utah springs no respect for a lady. he slams the door, pins her arm and slams again and again until the gun drops. utah kicks it away as the woman collapses in pain. pig nose #1 bails out and runs across parking lot. utah leaps up onto the crushed hood and draws down with the shotgun.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{halt. fbi!}
<A>__{pig nose #1 spins. we sense reckless anger. he raises the uzi. utah squeezes the trigger. no death. no blood. just buzzers and flashing bulbs. pig nose's flak vest lights up like a pinball machine. utah's laser weapon hit the "kill zone". pig nose rips the tape off his face and the fbi cadet shakes his head in disgust. observers step forward. bank customers. bank tellers. all fbi personnel. medical staff offer the woman driver assistance. pig nose #1 heads for johnny, but is subdued by other agents.}
<P>__{pig nose #1 (fbi cadet)}
<D>__{i wanna say just two words to you, asshole, simu lation!!! johnny fuckin' utah. guys like you will do anything to win!}
<A>__{utah stares back in defiance. the surveillance van pulls up nearby. binoculars runs out and pinches two fingers together, right in johnny's face.}
<C>__{binoculars}
<D>__{this far, utah! you're this far from being the most overqualified guy burger king ever had. get me?!}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{yes sir. sir?}
<C>__{binoculars}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{johnny gestures to the car.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{i did stop the perpetrators.}
<A>__{utah turns to go. as he passes he casually raises his laser shotgun and re triggers pig nose's flak vest.}
<B>__{lights and buzzers.}
<A>__{pig nose explodes. more agents restrain him. screams and shoving matches and pissed off guys. utah walks off, down the simulated street, past a sign which bears the fbi seal and reads "combat village, quantico, virginia."}

<A>__{red sky. a luminous pacific. five foot faces. nice curl. a lineup of surfers wait outside the break. silhouetted, bobbing like a pack of sea mammals.}

<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior venice beach}
<A>__{johnny utah trudging across the sand, holding his shoes. garment bag and a big duffel over his shoulder. he looks silly in his dark suit, tie loosened, wearing a turned around baseball cap. he wiggles his toes in the sand, looks around like a kid. a pack of bouncing beauties jog through frame. utah grins, reaches up and turns his cap around. it reads "i love l.a."}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior federal building}
<A>__{looking down the face of the concrete monolith at wilshire and veteran. ant like, johnny utah's tiny figure moves toward the entrance.}

<L>__{interior federal building fbi bullpen}
<A>__{supervising agent ben harp leads utah across the bullpen. rows of desks. agents sitting at computer terminals. data hell. looks like he got a job at xerox.}

<C>__{utah}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{utah is wearing a suit, carrying a briefcase. harp is mid thirties, confident of stride, tanned of skin, perfect of hair. gq. aggressive.}

<P>__{(poker face)}
<D>__{i take the skin off chicken.}
<A>__{harp glances at him, eyes narrowing. they reach a glassed in compound of small offices. harp swings the door open and the other agents look up as utah enters.}

<D>__{this is us. bank robbery. and you're in the bank robbery capital of the world }
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{last year in la county. up percent from the year before.}
<C>__{harp}
<D>__{that's right. and we nailed over a thousand of them. we did it by crunching data. good crime scene work, good lab work, good data base analysis. nobody had to tackle a car once. you getting the signal, special agent?}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{zero distortion, sir.}
<A>__{he picks up a donut from someone's desk, a succulent glazed jelly.}

<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{a blue field with a pulsing network of rippling lines. voom! a figure rockets down into frame in a curtain of bubbles. a gawky agent, in less than stylish fbi trunks, flails around blindfolded looking for bricks at the bottom of a pool.}
<L>__{interior gymnasium pool day}
<A>__{the pool casts wavy distortions upon two dozen men, all grumbling as they stand in line, wearing t shirts with fbi logos, sweats and sneakers. we hear a splash, and the men shuffle forward.}

<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{just read the goddamn number.}
<C>__{corey}

<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{screw you and this holistic fitness crap! at least my arms don't flap in the wind.}
<A>__{corey secretly squeezes his bicep as... a whistle blows. a broad shouldered man wearing an fbi cap barks at the greek.}
<C>__{big shoulders}
<D>__{okay, pappas, let's put on the blindfold. wanna see you retrieve at least two bricks from the bottom.}
<A>__{johnny utah enters the pool area in the distance. says something to one of the agents. is pointed toward us as corey ties the blindfold and guides pappas to the edge of the pool.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{i've been in the field 33 years, fired my piece 23 times in the line of duty, and i got no idea what a blind man fetching bricks has gotta do with being a special agent!}
<A>__{johnny has walked up. pappas, blindfolded, turns directly to utah as he continues, thinking it's corey.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{added to which indignity, i got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue flamer fresh out of quantico for a partner. some quarterback punk, johnny unitas or something.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{the shit they pull, huh?}
<A>__{pappas snorts agreement and cannonballs into the pool. huge backblast of water. the other agents hoot and holler. corey swears and wipes off his clipboard. johnny steps to the edge, looks down. we see the blindfolded pappas groveling along the bottom. the other agents cheer as pappas heads for the surface.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{here he comes. hold up a fish, he'll take it right outta your hand.}
<A>__{pappas surfaces in an explosion of spray as he sputters for breath. he grabs the edge and angrily slaps two bricks on the tiles. he rips off the blindfold looks up and frowns. a hand enters frame to help him up. pappas takes it and johnny hauls him on deck.}

<C>__{reagan}
<D>__{use a gun, go to heaven.}
