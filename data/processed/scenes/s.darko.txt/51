<L>__{interior motel room 15 night}
<A>__{corey lays on her stomach in bed, her head buried in the philosophy of time travel book. the television is on in the b.g. (out of focus), playing a repeat of the foreman grill}
<B>__{infomercial...}
<A>__{suddenly, there is a slight tremor from outside and ripple runs over the tv screen. corey looks around, taking no notice of the odd change on the television instead of george foreman's voice, hulk hogan is heard promoting the brand new hulkster grill... just then, there is a knock at the door. she gets up to answer it and finds randy he looks distraught.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{do you hate me?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{you think it's my fault she's dead.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{you mean it?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{yeah... it wasn't your fault.}
<A>__{randy sighs as if a big weight has been lifted.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{corey looks down and realizes that she's still holding the philosophy of time travel book in her hand.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{oh, it's just... something of sam's.}
<A>__{randy nods. corey tosses the book onto the bed.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{you wanna get outta here for a while? i got my dad's car.}
<A>__{i e. randy's dad's car lookout night randy's dad's car navigates a dirt road up a wooded hill to a vantage point where the whole of el reno can be seen. sparse lights flicker over about 80 square miles of civilization. there are a few other vehicles parked at the lookout, most containing couples with music playing low. randy pulls into a more secluded clearing, away from the other cars but still with a nice view.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i've been comin' up here since i was a kid. good place when you wanna just get away from everything.}
<A>__{randy pushes in a tape (suggestion: river of deceit, by mad season), then takes a joint from his pocket and sparks it up.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{is ruth your girlfriend?}
<A>__{randy passes the joint to corey and she hits it.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{naw, we're just friends. she's pretty weird sometimes. too like... intense, or something.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{seems like you guys are pretty close.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{yeah... don't worry about ruth.}
<A>__{randy takes another hit and holds it in.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{do you ever have a hard time telling what's real and what's not real?}
<A>__{randy exhales and looks over at her, perplexed.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{sometimes... sometimes something can feel really real, but it's just your mind playing tricks on you.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{i've got so much shit in my head right now... i've never felt so outta control. i think i'm really goin' psycho.}
<A>__{he passes her the jointerior}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i got some acid from my buddy one time... this like flying eagle pyramid shit. i took two hits, and man... next thing i knew i was on the floor, curled up in ball, and mike and jeff were just standing there lookin' down at me. i could see this like glowing grid cutting through my brain, and i knew when it got all the way through i'd be this sketched out vegetable. i could picture my dad staring down at me in the hospital in my straightjacket, crying and shit...}
<A>__{corey blows out a hit, captivated...}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{the whole time my esophagus was like twisting and turning in my throat and cutting off my air supply... it was terrible.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i can still slip back into it sometimes, but i know now that my brain is what's making it real... and that's like a blessing and a curse, man, `cause that means you have to decide what's real and what's not.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{the things that feel the most real right now are... impossible. more like a dream.}
<A>__{corey passes him the joint and he stamps out the roach in the car's ashtray.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i know what you mean. the scariest part is thinking you're not the same person anymore. something's changed... like your identity.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{what if the change is for the better?}
<A>__{randy finds an inhaler in his pocket and takes a puff.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{that's fucked up.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{i don't think i even care if i'm crazy.}
<A>__{corey turns and looks into his eyes. randy leans forward... they're about to kiss, when }
<C>__{corey }
<D>__{what the fuck?}
<A>__{a dark shape scurries to an enclosed area at the edge of the forest where there's a tarp, some water bottles, cans of food and a rifle... it's vietnam tom, and he's brought some supplies to his new}
<B>__{squatting ground.}
<C>__{corey }
<D>__{that fucking guy again...}
<A>__{randy and corey both laugh, relieving the tension. but tom's proximity has spoiled the mood.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{let's get outta here.}
