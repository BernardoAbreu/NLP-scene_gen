<A>__{"no. fuck you, choi, you just think you can come and go when you}
<D>__{please?"}
<A>__{choi is ignoring her now, walking straight for the phone booth as she is having a fit. tears are welling in her enraged face.}
<D>__{choi, if you have one shred of decency, if you even care about me }
<A>__{inexplicably, choi hangs his trench coat on the side of the booth. standing behind it, he reaches around with his arm, keeping the coat between his body and the phone. the woman doesnt even notice the web of gun harnesses and what looks like a ton of ammunition covering the inside of the jacket.}

<D>__{doing?"}
<C>__{choi}
<A>__{"the jacket stops fragmentation. sometimes they bomb the phones. kiss}
<D>__{me for luck."}
<A>__{he grabs her to him and thrusts his mouth onto hers. cu: phone his hand grabs the phone. we hear the dialtone, and he mashes down one of the numbers of the keypad. the number tone rises in pitch to a crescendo. we pull back and: the booth explodes. choi and the woman are bowled over by the flame.}
