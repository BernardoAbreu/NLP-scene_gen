<A>__{a comfortable drawing room, filled with the photographs and memorabilia of a former political life. margaret stands by the window, half a dozen of denis' ties in her hand. pulling back the net curtain, margaret peers out two policeman stand down below next to a police bmw car. they are lost in conversation, pointing to the door, clearly concerned. one police man nods to the other, a sense of the changing of the guard as he drives off in the bmw. suddenly from behind }
