<A>__{olive drops her defenses and gets real.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{have you ever decided just to play along? because it's maybe easier than fighting tooth and nail to defend it?}

<P>__{(he searches for the word)}
<D>__{damage you.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{you know, i think you should give me extra credit for going the extra mile. i'm really attempting to understand this puritanical ostracism.}
<A>__{mr. griffin smiles at her.}
<C>__{mr. griffin}
<D>__{hey, i'm really sorry i had to send you to the principal. if you tell anybody, i will deny it, but i really wanted to cheer with the rest of the class.}
