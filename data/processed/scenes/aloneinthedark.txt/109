<A>__{carnby puts the dishes from their meal into the kitchen sink. the sink tap is running. aline clears the dishes. the para meter fischer gave carnby starts faintly beeping, but the running sink tap covers the sound. something is coming. the lights in the loft flicker once. carnby turns off the tap and they listen intently. they can hear the scanner beeping faintly. the lights in the loft flicker and go out. aline grabs the flashlight and switches it on. carnby runs to his revolver and holster. he checks the chamber in his revolver. the bullets glow. carnby looks up, sensing something. he spins around, ready. a figure stands behind him. it is john. john looks fierce, his face drawn, gaunt. his eyes are sunken into dark recesses, with nearly clear irises.}

<D>__{john?}
<A>__{john lunges at carnby. carnby is too surprised to defend himself. john slams carnby against the wall, knocking his revolver out of his hands. john picks carnby up and hurls him across the loft. carnby crashes through furniture as he lands heavily. out of the shadows behind aline, two figures emerge. they are both missing orphans, one male, one female. they have the same gaunt faces and clear irises as john. carnby picks himself up. he spots the orphans behind aline.}

<A>__{the two orphans lunge at aline, but she's able to dodge out of the way. the orphans are fast and fierce. aline leaps forward, sliding across the floor towards carnby's revolver. she grabs it and spins to face the two orphans. they're gone. but then the female orphan leaps out at her. aline fires, hitting the female orphan in the shoulder. the female orphans jumps away, into the shadows. aline scrambles to her feet, the revolver ready. but the female orphans has disappeared. aline runs over to carnby. he grabs a shotgun from the weapons cabinet and loads it.}

<D>__{it is. the other two are from the orphanage as well.}
<A>__{carnby pumps the shotgun. carnby and aline creep forward into the darkness of the loft. they listen. suddenly, john lunges at him, his teeth bared. carnby smashes john across the head with the shotgun. but john keeps coming, slamming him against the wall. carnby breaks john's hold and swivel kicks him out of the way. john skitters off into the shadows. the female orphan leaps out at aline, trying to tear into her with her teeth. carnby grabs a pipe leaning against the wall and runs for aline. the male orphan lunges out at carnby. he smashes the male orphan across the face with the pipe. aline struggles with the female orphan. carnby turns to see john rising up behind her, about to strike.}

<A>__{arnby reacts instinctively. he fires, shooting john in the chest with a shotgun blast. john flails back, dead. the male orphan jumps out at carnby. now working on instinct, carnby spins and jams the pipe into his gut, impaling him. the male orphan stumbles to the ground and dies. aline gets away from the female orphan. as the female orphan lunges at her again, aline fires, shooting her three times in the chest. but it's only the third bullet, the one that hits the female orphan dead center in the chest that takes her down. the female orphan falls back, dead. aline comes up to carnby. he stands over john's corpse.}
