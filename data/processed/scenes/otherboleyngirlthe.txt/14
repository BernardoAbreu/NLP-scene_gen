<L>__{interior mary's room night}
<D>__{the duke of norfolk, sir thomas, and george boleyn arrive in mary's bedroom, and stare anxiously as the labour begins in earnest..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{does the king know?}
<C>__{a}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{he's on his way.}
<A>__{anne, who overhears this, surreptitiously adjusts her dress. mary screams in agony. the labour is well and truly under way. medically, it's a primitive, brutal affair.. no comprehension of sterilisation. midwives have dirty hands. physicians use rusty, blood stained instruments.. presently: the king arrives with several courtiers..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{any moment, your grace.}
<A>__{but the king hasn't heard. he has seen anne. suddenly, it's as if all sound, all vision disappears, except for anne. he stands beside her.. all around them the violence and dramatic activity of the birth unfolding; but for all their connection with it, henry and anne might as well be in a rose garden..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{anne..}
<A>__{anne stares ahead at mary's bed..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{anne, i love you..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{your grace, this is not the time..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i love you anne. i cannot stop thinking about you. i cannot eat, i cannot sleep..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but how could i ever trust you?}
<A>__{norfolk cranes his neck to listen..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{when i have seen how you have betrayed first your wife. and now my sister.}
<A>__{henry takes anne to one side...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i vow from this moment forth i will never lie with my wife, or speak to your sister again. i will do anything you ask..}
<B>__{a a}
<A>__{mary's contractions build. birth is imminent. physicians and midwives work to deliver the baby. anne thinks, then..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{then don't acknowledge the child.}
<A>__{henry is thrown..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{with a blood curdling scream, mary finally gives birth. sir thomas and norfolk crowd into the room, anxious to see..}
<C>__{physician}
<D>__{a boy!}
<A>__{sir thomas turns towards henry, beaming with happiness..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{it's a boy, your majesty. a strong, healthy boy.}
<A>__{henry's face: a boy? his eyes fill with emotion. this is what he has waited for. a son. anne notices his conflict, and prompts him again..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what my sister has given you, i could, too.}
<A>__{henry looks at the baby, then turns to face anne. his eyes are full of conflict, then..he silently nods. anne's face breaks out in a smile..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{very well.}
<A>__{then, in front of everyone, not caring how inappropriate it is, henry falls to his knee, takes anne's hand and kisses it. the audible sound of gasps. mary watches in horror as henry falls to his knees and kisses anne's hand..}
<C>__{m}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(a dagger in her heart)}
<D>__{henry..?}
<A>__{henry gets to his feet, then turns and walks away without looking in the direction of mary or the baby.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{my lord..?}
<A>__{mary stares after the king, but he does not turn around.}
<C>__{l}
<C>__{l}
<C>__{a}
<C>__{a}
<D>__{instead, mary's eyes meet anne's. anne's eyes stare back. the ultimate moment of revenge. barely perceptible smile of satisfaction, then anne turns and goes. the midwives and physicians stare at one another, visibly embarrassed by what they have just witnessed. the clearing of throats, averting of eyes. then they get on with their work to the sound of the mary's cries.. interior sir thomas's study night `crash', sir thomas and norfolk burst into the study, angrily slamming the door closed behind them. anne is inside.}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{damn you! three years we've been working on this! not a single detail was left to chance! and now, in the moment of our greatest glory.. norfolk stares at anne..}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{all i can say is you'd better have a plan. and it had better work. anne stares back defiantly..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{or what...uncle?}
<C>__{lady elizabeth}
<D>__{stop it! both of you. what shall we do about mary? and the child? or have we forgotten them already?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{mary should go back to her husband. not a flicker of emotion on her face.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{she has been inconvenienced long enough by this family.}
<C>__{ady elizabeth}
<D>__{fine. then you can be the one to tell her. ady elizabeth stares at anne..}
<C>__{a}
<C>__{lady elizabeth}
<D>__{i think you've earned that privilege. lady elizabeth turns and walks out. anne's smile fades. interior mary's apartment day mary lies in bed. she looks pale. exhausted. interior corridor day anne stares into the room through a crack in the doorway. a flicker of doubt. what has she done? to her own sister? anne checks herself. enough sentiment. she swallows it. nd enters. interior mary's apartment day mary looks up as anne enters, and freezes..}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{how can you show your face in here?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i understand you're angry but be assured. i did nothing, except remind him of you.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{oh, spare me. you did this deliberately. as revenge.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{and now you have what you wanted you probably think justice has been done.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{well, hasn't it?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{be careful, that's my advice. learn from my experience. because he'll only do to you what he has done to me.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{never. i will make sure he understands i'm a greater thing by far. that he can never have me until he makes me a far greater offer.}
<C>__{o}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you'll never get henry percy back, if that's what you mean.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{that's not what i mean. anne's eyes burn with anger..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{and don't you ever mention his name to me again. i will never forget how you betrayed me.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{if that's what you think, fine. tell yourself that.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i did, sister. every day for three years. anne turns, and walks out. exterior courtyard day mary is leaving court. pale. weak. her belongings have been packed into boxes. ahead of her, the baby is being carried by midwives, led by william stafford. mary walks across a courtyard, then stops in her tracks. ver by the stables: the king and anne are mounting horses to go riding together. henry lifts anne up into the saddle behind him,}
<P>__{(how she has learned!). anne holds tight, her arms wrapped}
<D>__{around his waist.. at that moment, anne looks over and sees mary. their eyes meet. they stare for a beat, then.. anne kicks henry's horse, `hah!', and they ride out. galloping into the distance. mary's face: fighting to hold onto her dignity. william stafford watches her, his eyes burning with sympathy. reverse angle: to reveal, this is all being watched by queen katherine, from a palace window above.. queen katherine turns, and coldly lets the curtain drop.. exterior countryside day mary and her entourage travel through the countryside in a small caravan of horses and wagons. it's raining heavily.}
<C>__{w}
<D>__{exterior hillside day the rain continues. mary's carriage approaches the manor house. at one time this was everything she wanted. now it's a prison. interior manor house night mary sits at the dinner table with her husband, william carey, who's health has deteriorated. he drinks heavily. a shadow of his former self. he stares at the baby..}

<C>__{william}
<D>__{have you christened the child?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{henry.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i see. a painful smile..}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{and is he to take my name? or is he to be a fitzroy or some other sign that he is a royal bast...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{he is to be henry carey.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i see. a silence, then..}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{well, then, here we are. william stares at mary. clearly still in love with her.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i could pretend none of this ever happened. start again.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{if you could. mary's face. manages a brave smile. interior carey's house court night mary lies in bed, her eyes open and staring blankly at the moon outside, as william carey makes love to her.}
