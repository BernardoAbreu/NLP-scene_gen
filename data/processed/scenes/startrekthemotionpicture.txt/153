<A>__{the crew all watching the awesome spectacle of v'ger's interior (on the viewer) as the enterprise is being pulled toward the brain complex. all are somewhat sub dued, for all realize how their journey will end but at the same time they also realize there is no other way. the camera pans, catching facial reactions as, in the b.g., we hear a constant flow of ad libbed crew comments:}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{twenty five minutes to device activation, sir. alt. (twenty two) alt. (eighteen)}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{starfleet has been apprised of our situation, captain.}

<B>__{angle on spock}
<A>__{his back to the viewer, the angle does not reveal his facial features, but we can discern him struggling to contain his feelings. wider angle (include kirk, mccoy, and decker) kirk's back to spock as he watches the viewer, kirk now turning toward spock.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{spock... spock...}
<A>__{spock does not respond, then kirk reacts with momentary annoyance, then realizes spock is totally distracted. kirk peers at him a moment, then suddenly rises and steps up to: spock's station kirk and spock (mccoy in b.g.) as kirk arrives, with spock still facing away from him, clearly distracted.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(starts)}
<D>__{mr. spock i think...}
<A>__{spock moves to face him, turning fully into the camera so we can see now, just under spock's eye: a tear ! welling fom the eye, rolling down his cheek. kirk is speechless a moment, glances at mccoy who has also witnessed this phenomenon, and started toward spock; but kirk gestures mccoy to stay back, as he addresses spock:}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(quiet, feeling)}
<D>__{not for us?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{no, captain, not for us... for v'ger.}
<A>__{spock pauses as kirk peers incredulously at him, then continues:}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i weep for v'ger, as i would for a brother far more knowledgeable than i and yet one step behind.}
<A>__{angle on mccoy and decker listening, mccoy's face reflecting concern; decker's face compassion and understanding, with decker step ping closer to spock, as spock continues:}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{as i was when i came aboard... so is v'ger now: empty, incomplete. searching. logic and knowledge are not enough. mccoy}
<P>__{(with empathy)}
<D>__{spock, are you saying that you found, what you needed but v'ger hasn't?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{has not, doctor and now, because of what we are planning... will not...}

<P>__{(almost hard)}

<D>__{mr. spock, what would v'ger need to fulfill itself?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{v'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. to fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; v'ger believes this can be achieved only by}

<D>__{each of us, at some time in our life, turns to someone, a father, a brother, a god and asks 'why am i here?' 'what was i meant to be?' v'ger hopes to touch its creator to find its answers.}
<B>__{across kirk to decker}
<A>__{as decker reacts with sudden, almost evangelical en lightenment, as kirk says:}

<P>__{(understanding)}

<B>__{past kirk and spock to the viewer}
<A>__{where another opening is suddenly visible another chamber . but the violent and color energy effects of the previous chambers are no longer evident. instead, the entire chamber appears beautifully symmetrical, with a strange, subdued glow, which increases as we move closer.}

<D>__{captain, i believe that is our destination.}
