<L>__{interior poppa joe yakavetta's office day. a.k.a. the joke.}
<A>__{rocco, still sporting a shiner, enters an office. there are papers everywhere and it is a cluttered mess of telephones, filing cabinets, lamps and chairs. rocco clutches a brown paper bag as if it is made of gold. poppa joe yakavetta, rocco's boss, is on the phone. he is in his late forties. he's always comfortably dressed; sleeves rolled up, collar unbuttoned. vincenzo lipazzi swaggers across the office to rocco. he is in his late thirties. he goes out of his way to look like elvis; open shirt, gold chains and medallions. he is overweight and has a bouffant hairdo, accompanied by elvis shades. vincenzo flips a half dollar in his hand constantly. rocco and vincenzo hate each other. yakavetta talks on the phone.}

<P>__{(snatching the package)}
<D>__{gimme the fuckin' thing. now sit the fuck down!}
<A>__{rocco obeys like an angry child. vincenzo puts it in front of yakavetta. he sits on a filing cabinet and flips his coin. vincenzo giggles and whispers as he pokes fun at rocco. the two of them resemble kids behind the teacher's back.}

<D>__{hey, rocco, wait. come back here.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{yeah boss?}
<A>__{vincenzo continues whispering for a few more seconds, long enough for rocco to see. vincenzo's lips are tight. his teeth grind.}

<D>__{i always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. they always come around telling me what a crack up you are. what is it they call you?}

<C>__{rocco}
<P>__{(deflated)}
<D>__{he says, "what's your third wish?" and the guys says, "i i want you to beat me half to death."}
<A>__{there's a long tense pause. suddenly, yakavetta throws his head back and roars with laughter. vincenzo joins in. rocco lets out a semi audible sign of relief and gradually starts laughing himself.}
<C>__{yakavetta}
<P>__{(still in guffaw)}
<D>__{very good stuff, rocco. very good stuff. tell me another one.}
<A>__{rocco returns to terror. yakavetta erupts again pointing at rocco.}
