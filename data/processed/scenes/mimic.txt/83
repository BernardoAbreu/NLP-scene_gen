<L>__{interior hospital hallway near morgue}
<A>__{an orderly (jeremy) argues with an emt. their point of contention: a small form lying on a stretcher.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{take it out back and throw it in the friggin' dumpster!}
<C>__{emt}
<D>__{not unless somebody signs for it.}
<A>__{susan walks toward them, catches sight of the tiny form. her eyes go wide.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<A>__{jeremy notices her.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{hey, you can't...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{jeremy...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{okay, jeremy...go get dr. chris raymond, will you?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{lady...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{did you hear me? get dr. raymond! now!!}
<A>__{jeremy hesitates. but if her tone wasn't enough, the stare she gives him certainly is.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{jeremy backs away, takes off down the hall. susan approaches the stretcher.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(to emt)}
<D>__{where'd you find it?}
<C>__{emt}
<D>__{washed up at the filtration plant on bank street. some asshole there thought it was a baby. they called us.}
<A>__{susan bends over it. she covers her mouth and nose at the stench.}
<C>__{emt}
<D>__{it's a lobster, right?}
<A>__{but it's not. what lies on the stretcher before them looks more like a demon from a brueghel painting. a three foot insect. it's mephitic, pink white body is rotten, falling apart. the head's intact, with strange, large jaws thrown wide open. the chitin on one is half gone.}
