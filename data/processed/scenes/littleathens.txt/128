<L>__{interior carter's house, living room night}
<A>__{allison is lying on her back on the couch with her head in heather's lap. heather is stroking allison's hair. they're both obliterated and just stuttering away.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{i'm all talk. i can't cheat on derek. i love derek. it's just that he makes me so mad. and that makes me a psycho. every time a girl loses her temper, she's a fucking psycho. can't i be upset without being a psycho? can't i just be mad?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{it's just every time you find a woman near derek, you go absolutely nuts.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{let's not use the word nuts, alright?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{yeah, well, don't say nuts.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{alright, you are mighty, mighty... not very nice when another girl is near your boyfriend.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{don't say nuts, don't say psycho, don't }
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i don't say those things.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{yes you do! yes you do!}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{what i meant, i don't mean them. i meant that i don't mean them. that i don't mean to say them.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{well, what do you mean?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{i don't know. i mean, you get so angry, it's a little scary.}
<A>__{allison sits up on the couch. heather sits up directly facing allison, her hands on allison's lap.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{i get scared when you get all angry. you get so mad sometimes, you start doing things, saying things to hurt people. around you.}
<C>__{heather}
<P>__{(starting to cry)}
<D>__{oh, i don't mean to! i'd never say anything to hurt you, ally!}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(also starting to cry)}
<D>__{i know. deep down, i know. but you get so angry...}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{i'm so sorry! oh, you're right! i am a psycho! a rotten bitch psycho! i scare you ally who would never hurt anyone or, or anything!}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{it's alright, i know you don't mean it!}
<A>__{heather hugs allison, who hugs back. both are bawling as they embrace.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{i don't mean it! you're my best friend! my sister! i love you so much!}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{no, maybe you shouldn't. maybe i don't deserve it!}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{you deserve it! you're so perfect!}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{don't say that! i'm not, i'm not!}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{yes you are!}
<A>__{wide on heather and allison. the noise of the party drowns out their conversation. allison is whispering forcefully into heather's ear. heather is listening, but cannot hear. we see her lips form the word "what?" allison continues whispering, and heather's face becomes furious. she pushes allison back.}
<C>__{heather }
<D>__{you fucking slut!}
<A>__{heather shoves allison hard off the couch. as allison stumbles roughly and attempts to recover, partygoers, mostly guys, gather around, cheering wildly. heather kicks furiously at allison, who is on all fours employing the turtle defense. we catch a glimpse of allison's face she is in utter panic. heather's foot catches allison square in the face, knocking her limp. most of the crowd has stopped cheering. heather continues to kick at allison's limp body, and two skinny guys pull heather away. heather shakes them off and leaves in a huff, while everyone is tending to allison.}
