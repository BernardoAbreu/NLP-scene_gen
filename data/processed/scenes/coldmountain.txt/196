<L>__{exterior three way crossing, cold mountain. day}
<A>__{inman has roped stobrod to the horse which he pulls down a steep slope. behind him, their hooves muffled by the snow, a group of riders join the trail, in slow but steady pursuit. inman walks on, apparently oblivious to who's behind him. he and stobrod are some distance from broken ground, a fringe of trees.}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(quietly to stobrod)}
<D>__{don't look round.}
<C>__{stobrod}
<D>__{got it.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{how many men does he have?}
<C>__{stobrod}
<D>__{there were five. you can't reason with that man.}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(takes off his gloves)}
<D>__{i got a conversation stopper.}
<P>__{(they're getting closer)}
<D>__{closer we get to that broken ground the better.}
<A>__{inman opens his coat. stobrod looks at the lemats. they're at the edge of the trees.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{you hold on tight, do you hear? when i say three, look round, nice and slow.}
<C>__{stobrod}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{one, two, three.}
<A>__{stobrod looks round. inman doesn't. teague has some new bodies in his entourage but they're all dead. a spare horse has three corpses hung over it, another horse drags a makeshift litter with a couple more, souvenirs of their cave visit. teague waves.}
<C>__{teague}
<D>__{god damn! you're a hard fucker to put down.}
<P>__{(they approach)}
<D>__{good directions to that cave from the fat boy saw the squirrels, sat on the tree made some friends, brought some back with me.}
<A>__{his riders begin, quite casually, to fan out. in one movement, inman slaps the flank of the horse. which careers down the track, then turns and fires, twice, before}
<B>__{pitching himself into a roll towards the trees. his first}
<A>__{shot knocks jo from his horse, the second mo, who falls into the snow, bleeding from the groin and screaming. the riderless horse gets tangled up with the others. inman is in the trees, shots around him. he doesn't move away from, but towards the riders inside the line of trees. grayling charges him, riding into the trees. inman shoots him, then rushes from the trees, firing, missing bosie, who rides away, evidently not relishing the fight, and throws himself at teague, whose horse is bucking wildly. teague's carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air. inman yanks the gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the shotgun barrel of the lemats with the other, the big pistol almost leaping from his hand with the recoil. teague's chest opens out as he's thrown off the horse. mo is still screaming. inman walks over and shoots him in the head, then walks to teague, who is saying something, the blood blotting the snow under him. inman studies him, picks up the spencer carbine, turns to look where bosie has gone, steps up onto teague's horse, reins the horse in, and trots it over to the prostrate teague, leans over and shoots him dead. he turns the horse in the direction bosie had headed. he can't see horse or rider, but in the stand of hickory trees ahead, the gusts of steaming breath betray them both. he rides slowly towards the stand of trees.}
