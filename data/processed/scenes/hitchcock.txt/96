<L>__{interior hitchcock house, dining room day}
<A>__{hitch and alma sit at the table having lunch. alma eats a pork chop while hitch defiantly nibbles at his healthy salad. he has a nice big glass of red wine which alma ignores.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{so i read your finished treatment. "taxi to " where was it?}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{dubrovnik.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{that's it. dubrovnik. care to hear my opinion?}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{yes. naturally.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{there's no other way of saying it. it's stillborn. dead in the water.}
<A>__{alma blinks, unable to hide her shock.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<P>__{(with mock compassion)}
<D>__{the plot's a muddle. some of the jokes are awfully like things we already did better hundreds of years ago in the lady vanishes. and your villain is weak. but the biggest failure is the relationship between the hero and heroine.}
<A>__{he picks up a radish and bites into it.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{if you weren't so smitten with your friend whitfield cook you'd probably see that.}
<A>__{alma is entirely stunned. hitchcock has delivered the killer blow he intended. he gets up and goes over to the garden door.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{women never really care to face the truth when their hearts are involved, do they?}
<A>__{as he steps out into the garden }
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{how would you know what really goes on between a man and a woman?}
