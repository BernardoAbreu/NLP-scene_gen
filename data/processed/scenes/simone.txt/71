<D>__{well, no one could accuse you of being over exposed, simone. why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?}
<C>__{simone}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i just think actors talk too much. does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening friday?}
<C>__{frank brand}
<D>__{of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.}
<A>__{viktor is in his element, his effeminate gestures frighteningly convincing.}
<C>__{simone}
<P>__{(from tv)}
<D>__{don't i know it. that's the only reason i'm here now to put the attention back where it belongs, on mr. taransky's film.}
<C>__{frank brand}
<D>__{you don't secretly want the attention?}
<C>__{simone}
<D>__{i'm not even sure i deserve it. after tonight i will have almost as much screen time on your show as i do in my movies. how is that healthy for a performer?}
<A>__{ie. elaine's mansion day lainey has turned her back on the tv screen, preferring to look through a book.}
<C>__{simone}
<P>__{(from tv)}
<D>__{because, you have to understand, frank, these interviews none of this is real. who i am on screen and who i really am are two totally different people.}
<C>__{frank brand}
<D>__{who are you really?}
<C>__{simone}
<D>__{that's a good question.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{as nietzsche said, "whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."}
<C>__{lainey}
<P>__{(reading from a bookmarked page, along with simone)}
<D>__{"... he ends up finding it is difficult to be himself again."}
<C>__{frank brand}
<D>__{well put.}
<A>__{lainey regards the name written on the inside page "viktor taransky".}
