<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{no... if you were carrying something for me i would have to worry about you... if you go empty handed i can put you out of my mind!}
<A>__{hector smiles uncertainly, unsure if francisco is making a joke. then he becomes more serious.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i want to ask you something. there's no easy way to do it...}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{go on, hector...}
<C>__{hector}

<C>__{hector}
<D>__{can i have them? you can have mine... they'll be fine for here... but i have to walk six hundred miles...}
<A>__{hector lifts a foot to show francisco his boot. francisco is stunned into silence. but then a smile comes to his face.}
<C>__{francisco}

<A>__{francisco starts to take off his boots. hector does the same. he can't believe his luck. at this moment, he loves francisco. he makes nonsensical small talk, hopping around on one foot.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{they were made by da fosca, weren't they?}
<A>__{francisco is giggling now.}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{the best bootmaker in goa... pray for my soul in lisbon, hector... and pray for your own...}
