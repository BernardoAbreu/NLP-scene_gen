<L>__{interior charlie's saloon night}
<A>__{as haven enters. it is crowded. haven pauses by a table. he sees charlie at the piano singing. he sees mick cross to prince and say something, then prince gazes in his direction. haven's eyes meet those of prince suddenly turned to him, cold as glass. charlie, seeing that haven is watching and listening to her impromptu singing, stops and makes her way through the crowd towards a booth off the dance floor. haven's eyes follow her. med. shot of booth as charlie sits down. a sandwich is waiting for her. she takes a bite of it, then glances up to see haven standing beside the table.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{how about eating alone? is that a bad habit too?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{just when you have to pay for it.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{it's only money.}
<P>__{(sitting down)}
<D>__{i've changed my mind since i left here awhile ago. i don't want to pick a fight or break the bank or }
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{what changed your mind?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{that's what i came back to find out.}
<A>__{charlie glances at him, then at the crowd where mick marion stands beside prince. both are looking coldly towards the booth. haven's gaze follows hers towards mick, as prince leaves the big man.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{maybe it would be better if you found another girl.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{no, it wouldn't... i looked.}
<A>__{she smiles slightly back at him, glances away towards mick. haven looks too, curiously. mick is still watching, coldly. others glance too, as though this were an unexpected thing. mick takes a drink from a passing waiter; kills it in one gulp. haven looks back at charlie's face and smiles.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{that man in ape's clothing could he be charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{his eyes follow you around like a couple of flies.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{they follow me to see that strangers don't annoy me.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{only strangers?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no one else would be so foolish.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{first, you're beautiful. then i like the way you sing and now you're a woman of mystery.}
<P>__{(to a passing waiter)}
<D>__{champagne?}
<A>__{the waiter nods and leaves. charlie is still gazing at haven with that slight provocative smile.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i don't want to be a stranger, so i will have to be foolish.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you like to take chances, don't you?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{if i feel lucky.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{then i'd advise you to try the dice table.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i'd rather get lucky here.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{every man has a right to go to his own funeral.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(as the waiter sets}
<D>__{down the champagne}
<P>__{and glasses)}
<D>__{i could be your cousin from waxahatchio. i could be cousin john, a missionary on his way to china.}
<A>__{the waiter leaves, as charlie still regards haven with a curious interest. haven is glancing again toward mick, just as that animal barrels down another whiskey.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{he seems to be a lot of man.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{the most in town.}
<A>__{at this moment prince comes into scene and sits at the table. haven looks at him but charlie offers no introduction.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{it's a very small town.}
<P>__{(he sips and gazes around)}
<D>__{you could get it all in this saloon.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we usually do.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{so charlie probably runs the town.}
<C>__{prince}
<P>__{(toying with his dice)}
<D>__{why do you care?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i'm going to spend some time here. i want to know who winds the clock.}
<A>__{he glances up and a slow smile comes over his face as mick marion is seen approaching deliberately and with cold menace. her eyes follow his, then back to his face.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's been a nice conversation. i hate to have it end.}
<A>__{blank faced and big, mick arrives at the booth. he stares from charlie to haven. haven looks at him then at charlie. charlie watches haven's face, but the smile remains. it seems to sway her, this little test of expression.}
<C>__{mick}
<D>__{who's this?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(after a taut pause)}
<D>__{mick this is cousin john.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{from waxahatchie.}
<A>__{mick is not quite sure.}
<C>__{mick}
<D>__{what's keeping him?}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{i think he's wondering if he couldn't do more good here.}
<A>__{haven senses now it is a little game they're playing together on him. his smile remains. he reaches for the bottle, his hand grasping the base of it, just as mick reaches for it too, clenching the top. mick lifts at it; haven's hand holds. they look at each other as this little game of strength goes on.}
<C>__{mick}
<D>__{you aren't very friendly, are you, mister?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(quoting)}
<D>__{a friend to all is a friend to none.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{you ought to learn not to pick 'em so easy, like you do your cousins.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(indicating charlie)}
<D>__{ask her?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{i never saw him before in my life.}
<A>__{that does it. mick wrenches at the bottle, and as he does so, haven releases his grip. the bottle shoots up. the wine spills over mick's face and clothes. infuriated, mick flings the bottle at haven, but haven ducks as he comes out of the chair. the bottle crashes against the wall, and haven's fist crashes against mick. the big man grunts and staggers back, but he doesn't drop. as haven sets himself, he is suddenly pinned from behind by two bouncers. mick stands still, staring at him, his cut lip bleeding.}
<C>__{mick}
<P>__{(icily)}
<D>__{you're too little to make that big a mistake.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you want to correct me or just bleed at the mouth?}
<A>__{there is a dead silence. at the crap table the dice read seven but no one looks at them, all turning toward the scene. a minor rises and the girl on his lap hits the floor. a drunk steals a drink and no one sees him. (business with glass) prince looks on coldly. mark bristow, moving up from the dice table, pauses and stares.}
<C>__{mick}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{bring him outside.}
<A>__{the two bouncers start with haven toward the door, mick following. a rear rises and men begin following in their silent wake. only the guy at the piano keeps on playing: he never stops. angle on charlie as she rises. bristow and prince have sauntered over to her as the place empties, leaving only the piano player.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{a misunderstanding.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{did you find out what he wants?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(starting out)}
<D>__{he wanted to be my cousin.}
<P>__{(they follow her)}
<D>__{only i haven't any aunts or uncles.}
<P>__{(still casually)}
<D>__{but you never know and the least i can do is bury him.}
<A>__{prince lets go with one of his rare smiles as he looks admiringly at charlie. they reach the door. the crowd opens for them a little.}
