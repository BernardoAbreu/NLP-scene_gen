<L>__{exterior car}
<A>__{as the car squeals to a halt hi is catapulted through where the windshield used to be, tumbling over the hood onto the front lawn. he rolls to his feet and, as he runs up the lawn, calls back over his shoulder:}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{thank you.}
<L>__{into the house}
<A>__{we are tracking behind hi as he runs up to the house and crashes through the screen door. still tracking behind him as he runs through the living room. a middle aged couple sits on the couch watching tv. they look up as hi rushes by. hi plunges down a staircase. as he does so we hear: ka chick ka chock ka chick ka chock. he emerges into a rec room where he and we rush past two kids playing ping pong. he runs out the back door.}
<B>__{tracking with the policeman}
<A>__{as he runs into the house. as he runs through the living room we catch a glimpse of the middle aged couple gaping at him. officer steensma plunges down the stairs.}
<B>__{tracking on hi}
<A>__{outdoors now, running, crossing the street behind the house and entering the parking lot of a supermarket on the other side.}
<B>__{back to the house}
<A>__{as a pack of dogs thunders in. the lead doberman with chain and spike has now picked up about a dozen neighborhood dogs. the dogs thunder through the living room and down the stairs. as they hit the rec room the thunder of their feet turns into the clatter of nails on tile.}
