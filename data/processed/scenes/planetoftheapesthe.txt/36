<L>__{39 another angle favoring landon}
<A>__{he seems not to have heard.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{landon! join the expedition.}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{sorry...}
<P>__{(crossing to his kit)}
<D>__{i was thinking of stewart. what d'you suppose happened?}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{air leak. died in her sleep.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{you don't seem very cut up about it.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{it's a little late for a wake. she's been dead nearly a year.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{then we've been away from earth for eighteen months.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{by our time.}
<P>__{(smiling at landon)}
<D>__{you've turned gray.}
<A>__{landon involuntarily touches the gray hair of his temple as taylor adds lightly:}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{i read the clocks. they bear out hasslein's hypothesis. we've been away from earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{still can't accept it, huh?}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{long pause)}
<D>__{you know it.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for they're dust.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{prove it. if we can't get back, it's still just a theory.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{it's a fact, landon. buy it. you'll sleep better.}
<A>__{dodge enters scene. a handful of reddish sand dribbles through his fingers.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{any sign of dangerous ionization?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{okay. if there's no life here, we've got just seventy two hours to find it. that's when the groceries run out.}
<A>__{he picks up one of the rucksacks and puts it on. the others follow suit.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{which direction?}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(decisively, pointing west)}
<D>__{that way.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{any particular reason?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{none at all.}
<A>__{he moves out. dodge follows. camera pans with them. they have gone only a few paces when taylor looks back over his shoulder and halts.}
