<L>__{interior penthouse night}
<A>__{the penthouse is huge, far and away the best suite in the house. and standing in the middle of the biggest room in the hotel is the hottest, newest comedy star to burst onto the hollywood scene in nearly a decade: chester rush. at this moment in time, he's the king, and he has the swagger of a new king. after only one movie, he's pulled the sword out of the stone. and the look on his face says, "king's good." surrounding him is his entourage. they all look like once upon a time this evening they were dressed sharp; however, at this late hour, everybody looks about as disheveled as ted. one of the lads, norman, has planted roots in a comfy chair with his leg thrown over the arm and a bottle of jim beam in his hand. the second guy, leo, is in the back of the room pacing back and forth on the telephone. he is completely oblivious to the rest of the room's activity. in chester's hand is an ever present glass of champagne, which he constantly spills as he gestures wildly. around the room are the leftovers: pizza boxes, fast food hamburgers, and empty bottles of cristal champagne.}

<P>__{(still sitting)}
<D>__{entrez, entrez, come in, come in.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(wheeling in the tray)}
<D>__{hi, sorry i took so long, but i got everything you asked for }
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{ not a problem, my friend mr. bellboy.}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(closing the door)}
<D>__{his name's theodore.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{actually, it's not theodore,}
<P>__{(he throws a look at angela)}
<D>__{it's ted.}
<A>__{chester rises from the couch.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{so, ted the bellboy, as i was saying would you care for some champagne? that's not what i was saying, but would you care for some champagne?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{ya sure? cristal. it's the best. i never liked champagne before i had cristal, now i love it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay, yeah, sure.}
<A>__{as chester goes and pours ted a glass:}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{ as i was saying, ted, don't worry about being late. for our purposes, promptness is far behind thoroughness.}
<A>__{on "thoroughness," he hands ted the glass.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{chin chin.}
<A>__{they clink glasses and drink.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{whadya say, ted?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{thank you?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{no, not thank you. whadya say about the tasty beverage?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's good.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{fuckin' good, ted. it's fuckin' good. let's try it again, shall we? so, ted, whadya think about the beverage.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's fuckin' good.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{you bet your sweet bippy, ted. it's fuckin' cristal, everything else is piss.}
<A>__{norman in the chair starts yelling at ted.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{bellboy! bellboy! bellboy!}
<A>__{ted knows he's being laughed at, but not why.}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(to norman)}
<D>__{knock it off, you're making my friend ted here uneasy.}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{pay no attention to norman here, ted, he's just fuckin' wit' ya, that's all. that's from quadrophenia. now me, myself, when i think of bellboys i think of "bellboy" isn't an insult, is it? is there another name for what you do that i'm ignorant of? bellman, bellperson }
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{bellboy's fine.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{good. i'm glad they haven't changed that. there's a friendliness to "bellboy." as i was saying, ted, when norman thinks of bellboys, he thinks of quadrophenia.}
<A>__{but me, when i think of bellboys, i think of the bellboy, with jerry lewis. didja ever see the bellboy?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{you should, it's one of jerry's better movies. he never says a word through the entire film. a completely silent performance. how many actors can pull that off? and he has to go to france to get respect. that says it all about america right there. the minute jerry lewis dies, every paper in this fuckin' country gonna write articles calling the man a genius. it's not right. it's not right and it's not fair. but why should that surprise anybody? when has america ever been fair? we might be right every once in a while, but we're very rarely fair.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{where do you want this?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{you in a hurry, ted?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(he is, but doesn't}
<D>__{want to rush the}
<P>__{movie star)}
<D>__{no, not particularly.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{good, then stop playing "beat the clock." now let me introduce you to everybody.}
<A>__{he puts his arm around ted and leads him around the room. angela crosses frame, drink in hand.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{our friend from downstairs you already seem to be acquainted with.}
<A>__{as she snuggles up in a big comfy chair:}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{oh, me and theodore go way back. don't we, theodore?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{the name's ted, angela. i only let people with loaded guns at my head call me theodore.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{angela's like you, ted, a newfound friend.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{we met at the pool.}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{have you ever seen angela in a one piece?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{well, it's somethin' to see.}
<P>__{(arm around ted)}
<D>__{the man sitting in the chair, with the bottle of jim bean in his hand and the sense of humor, is norman. norman, say hello to ted.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what's up?}
<A>__{norman shakes his hand.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{the sociable son of a bitch on the telephone is leo. and the person on the other end of the phone is his lovely wife ellen.}
<P>__{(to leo)}
<D>__{leo, say hello to ted.}
<A>__{leo breaks away from his phone conversation for two seconds.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{hi, ted, glad you could make it.}
<P>__{(back to phone)}
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what does punctuality have to do with love?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{which brings me to me, chester rush, ted. pleased to meetcha.}
<A>__{chester shakes ted's hand.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i know. i'm sorry i haven't seen your movie.}
<A>__{chester stops. ted wonders if he should have said that. chester walks over to the table and pours himself some more champagne. when he talks now it's slower and somewhat distracted. the tone of the scene starts changing.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{it's quite all right, ted, nothing to feel sorry about. that's why god invented video. but you know, ted, a lot of people did see it.}
<A>__{chester takes a drink of champagne, a disgusted look crosses his face, and he slowly puts it down. his manner gives the room a chill. when he talks, he addresses the room.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{who drank out of this bottle last?}
<A>__{no answer. chester walks over to ted and fills his glass.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{who drank out of this bottle not the other bottles this bottle last?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what's wrong, chester?}
<A>__{he spills the champagne from his glass onto the floor.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{it's fuckin' flat, norman, that's what's wrong. the champagne the fuckin' cristal's fuckin' flat.}
<A>__{chester improvises a temper tantrum about the flat cristal. everyone looks at him, not knowing what to say. even leo walks over to witness. the whole room is uneasy and a little frightened. when chester finishes his tantrum, he turns his attention back to ted. as he talks to him, he opens up another bottle. but it's not the rapid pace delivery chester has done so far. it's more troubled and distracted.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{i was saying, ted, a lot of people did see it. and not just on video, either. leo, what was the final take on domestic?}
<A>__{leo is still in the doorway making sure his boy's cool.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{72.1 million.}
<P>__{(worried tone)}
<D>__{you okay, champ?}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(struggling with bottle)}
<D>__{i'm cool, so talk to your wife.}
<A>__{leo turns his attention back to the phone and goes inside the room.}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{72.1 million dollars. that's before video and before foreign, and before pay tv and before free tv. we're talking fuckin' asses in fuckin' seats.}
<P>__{(he pops the cork)}
<D>__{before all that other shit, the wacky detective made 72.1 million dollars.}
<A>__{chester walks over to ted and fills his glass.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{and my new one, the dog catcher, it's projected to break a hundred.}
<P>__{(he clinks ted's glass with his)}
<D>__{the dog catcher.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{the dog catcher.}
<A>__{they both drink. the tantrum's over, and chester's back to his fast talking, good natured self.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{now let's stroll over here and see what goodies you brought us.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{do you mind me asking what's all this stuff for?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{one thing at a time, ted. i'm not a frog and you're not a bunny, so let's not jump ahead. c'mon, norman, you should be interested in this.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{damn skippy!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{tell it.}
<A>__{ted produces the things they called for.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{a block of wood.}
<A>__{chester knocks on it.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{three nails.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{why three nails?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{that's how many peter lorre asked for. continue, ted.}
<A>__{ted is completely bewildered.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{a roll of twine.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{that's definitely a roll of twine. continue.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{a bucket of ice.}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(to norman)}
<D>__{you into it?}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(to chester)}
<D>__{i'm into it.}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{a donut.}
<A>__{chester takes it and eats it.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{that's for me. continue.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{and a hatchet.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{a hatchet as sharp as the devil himself is what i asked for.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, you be the judge.}
<A>__{ted holds the hatchet out for chester to take. norman snatches it instead.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i will be the judge.}
<A>__{norman touches the end of the blade with his thumb.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{whadya think?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{that's a sharp motherfucker. bring all this bullshit over to the bar.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{you heard him, ted.}
<A>__{ted is completely confused and starting to get a little scared, but he does what he's told. leo slams down the phone.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{bitch!}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you still married?}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{maybe, maybe not, but i don't give a flyin' fuck either way. i've had it with that machiavellian bitch! i'm too drunk to drive home. i'm sorry about that, i'm real sorry about that. i got drunk on new year's eve, cut my fuckin' head off...}
<P>__{(noticing ted at the bar)}
<D>__{what's going on here?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{we now return you to the man from rio, already in progress.}
<C>__{leo}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{noooo, you're gonna do it?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{looks like.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{you guys ain't bullshittin', you're gonna really go for it?}
<A>__{angela is still curled up.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{after talkin' about it all night, they better. i wanna see a show.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{when we do it, you'll have something to see.}
<A>__{leo walks up to norman and throws his arm around him.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{you are one radical dude.}
<A>__{ted doesn't know what anybody's talking about, which is just fine with him. he finishes laying out everything on the bar and says:}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, that's everything, so if you don't need me for anything else, i will go back downstairs.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{not so fast, ted. we ain't quite done yet. why don't you take a seat at the bar, get comfortable, and have an open mind when we explain the festivities of the evening to you.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, guys, you paid for the room. as long as you don't break up the furniture, you can do whatever the fuck you want. and me personally, i don't care if you break up the furniture. you don't have to explain anything to me. whatever constitutes a good time as far as you guys are concerned is your business.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{well, it's your business, ted. 'cause we want you to take part.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{take part in what?}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{chester, your way of breaking the news to him gently is scarin' the shit outta him.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{look at the poor guy. just spit it out.}
<A>__{little by little everybody has gathered around ted.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{first off, let me say that there's nothing homosexual about what we're going to ask you to do. there's nothing sexual at all about what we want. but i was thinkin' you might be thinkin' we want you to do some sex thing. pee on us, suck us off, shit like that. let me assure you nothing could be farther from what we want }
<A>__{angela interrupts:}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{can i jump in here?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{no, you can't jump in here, this is my story.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{theodore's been here fifteen minutes and you've talked about everything but.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{hey, if you don't like it, you can get the fuck out.}
<A>__{leo taps his champagne glass with a tiny spoon, shutting everybody up.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{if it'll please the court, let me explain to ted our intentions.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{i second the nomination!}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{move the nomination be closed!}
<A>__{chester takes the hatchet and brings it down on the bar like a hatchet.}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{leo, the floor is yours.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{ted, did you ever watch the old "alfred hitchcock show"?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(totally bewildered at this point)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{did you ever see the episode the man from rio, with peter lorre and steve mcqueen?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{oh, you'd remember it all right. in the show, peter lorre makes a bet that steve mcqueen can't light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row. now if steve mcqueen can light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row, he wins peter lorre's new car. if he can't he loses his little finger.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{norman and chester just made the same bet.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{norman's putting up his pinky against chester's mint convertible, 1964 red convertible chevy corvelle that he can light his zippo ten times in a row.}
<A>__{pause. ted looks at all of them, taking in the information, before saying:}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you guys are drunk.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{well, that goes without saying, but that doesn't mean we don't know what we're doing.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i will tell ya what i'm doin'.}
<A>__{norman lays an issue of hot classic cars in front of ted on the bar. on the cover is a picture of chester smiling, standing next to a beautiful 1964 red convertible chevy corvelle. the headline reads: "hollywood's hottest new star next to america's hottest old car."}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i drive a motherfuckin' honda my sister sold me. you hear what i'm sayin'? a little white motherfuckin' honda civic.}
<P>__{(he holds up the magazine)}
<D>__{you see this shit?!}
<P>__{(reading the magazine)}
<D>__{"hollywood's hottest new star, next to america's hottest old car."}
<P>__{(he hands ted the magazine)}
<D>__{now you take a good look at that machine that this motherfucker over here is standing next to. that's a 1964 nigger red, rag top chevy corvelle. and i love that car more'n i love hips, lips, and fingertips. cut to we sittin' here celebrating, gettin' high, drinkin' champagne }
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{ cristal. when you're drinkin' anything else, you're drinking champagne. when you're drinkin' cristal, you say you're drinkin' cristal.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{ drinkin' cristal. watchin' tv. "rockin' new year's eve." when all of a sudden we flip on steve mcqueen and peter lorre bein' fuckin' badass. and i look at this funny motherfucker over here, and i say, "i'd do that for the chevelle."}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{and chester replies...}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{"...oh, really?"}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you guys wouldn't be doin' something this stupid unless you were drunk.}
<A>__{everybody breaks into a "here, here" murmur.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i think that pretty much goes without sayin'. we'd probably chicken out. but when you're fucked up, you don't lie. you tell the fuckin' truth. and the fuckin' truth is, my lucky zippo's gonna win me chester's car.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(to chester)}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{thrill of the bet. i'm the one with something to lose here. 'cause i can pretty near guarantee that i love my car more'n norman loves his pinky.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(to leo)}
<D>__{how 'bout you guys, you're just gonna sit back and let your friends mutilate each other?}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{why not? life don't get much more exciting than this. i mean if norman was puttin' his dick on the choppin' block, i'd step in, 'cause, ya know in the morning, we'd really regret that. but his pinky? who gives a fuck? i mean theoretically, he could lose that choppin' onions tomorrow. life still goes on.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(to angela)}
<D>__{how 'bout you?}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{which brings us to your part in this little wager.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i don't have a part.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{now, ted, my old granddaddy used ta say: "the less a man makes declarative statements, the less he's apt to look foolish in retrospect." now there're some inherent obstacles in this undertaking. first of all, i'm not some sick fuck like peter lorre on that show, travelin' the countryside collecting fingers. we're all buddies, here. nobody wants norman to lose his finger. we just wanna chop it off. so if fate doesn't smile on ol' norman, we'll put his finger on ice and rush 'im to a hospital, where in all likelihood be able to sew it back on.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{hopefully.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{eighty percent.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{our side.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{so norman's protected. his interests have been looked after. my interests, on the other hand, have not. i am as emotionally attached to my car as norman is physically to his finger. i'm putting up a very expensive piece of machinery on this wager. now, if i lose, i lose, i have no problem with that. i'm a big boy, i knew what i was doing. however, if i win, i wanna win. if norman lights his lighter ten times in a row, he's gonna have no emotional problems about taking my car keys whatsoever. but if i win, it's not inconceivable that leo or myself, at the last minute, might not be able to wield the ax. which brings us full circle to you, ted. sober ted. clear eyed ted. we want you to be the diceman.}
<A>__{pause as they all look at him. angela breaks it.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{helluva night, huh, ted?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i gotta get out of here.}
<A>__{ted abruptly gets up and makes a beeline for the door. chester whips out a hundred dollar bill and quickly calls to ted from his position at the bar.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{ted, i got a hundred dollar bill here with your name on it, whether you do what we ask or not, just to sit back down in the chair for one minute more.}
<A>__{ted spins in his direction.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'm not gonna cut off his finger!}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{maybe you will and maybe you won't, but that has nothing to do with this hundred dollar bill in my hand. you can tell us all to go fuck off and walk right out that door. but if you sit back down and wait sixty seconds before you do it, you'll be a hundred dollars richer.}
<A>__{ted just stands across the room, thinking.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{ted. take the money.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{ted, you're gonna do whatever you want to do. we're just askin' you to indulge us for another minute more. and chester's willin' to pay for it.}
<A>__{ted thinks.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i will take your money, and i will sit back down. but a minute from now, i'm gonna walk out the door, and when i do, there'll be no hard feelings?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{well, i want you to have a bit more of an open mind than that, but, yeah, we'll either convince you or we won't. no hard feelings. right, guys?}
<A>__{everybody agrees. ted wearily sits back down. chester positions himself in front of ted at the bar.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{okay, leo, you be the timekeeper. let us know when one minute begins and when it ends.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{you got it.}
<P>__{(he checks his watch)}
<D>__{gentlemen, start your engines.}

<C>__{chester}
<D>__{okay, pay attention here, ted, i ain't got much time. now i'm gonna make two piles here on the bar.}
<P>__{(he takes the hundred }

<P>__{it out on the bar)}
<D>__{one pile,}
<P>__{(pointing at the hundred dollar bill)}
<D>__{which is yours. and another pile,}

<P>__{a second pile)}
<D>__{now, what you have to be aware of is we're gonna do this bet, one way,}
<P>__{(he lays another}
<D>__{hundred on the end}

<D>__{how much is on the bar already? i lost count.}

<D>__{ barring alzheimer's of course. now, what we're proposing is so unusual, so outside the norm, that i think it would be a pretty good guess that this will be one of those experiences that sticks. so, since you're gonna be stuck remembering this moment for the rest of your life, you gotta decide what that memory will be.}
