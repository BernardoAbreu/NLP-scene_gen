<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where i keep 'em.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{doesn't have to figure out shit. you told him you keep 'em at your house.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(shrugs, big smile)}

<D>__{twenty two months, three days, two hours. why?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i was just thinking that i could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way. i'm talkin' about when you're outta here. i mean, you can't rob banks for ever.}
<A>__{foley looks at ripley.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{it's a little late for me.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{hey, jack? bullshit. i didn't make my first million until i was forty two. forty two. you really want to change, it's never too late.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm not exactly the nine to five type.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{who is? but then you gotta look at a job as more than just work. you gotta look at it as peace of mind. as security , you know what i mean? i got offices in detroit, miami, boston, take your pick.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{my ex wife's in miami. it's nice down there.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no need to decide now. be like the fish. let whatever happens happen.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{the fish?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{yeah, fish live in the present. they don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow. even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved. no guilt afterward. no whining on some fish shrink's couch. they just do it. they accept.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i can't say that i've paid that much attention to 'em before.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{the fish saved my life. two years ago, i found out i had high blood pressure. so my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time i felt myself stressing out.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{and the guy sent you a bill for this?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it works. you should try it sometime.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{the next time i walk into a bank.}
<A>__{ripley shakes his head, then gets up...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{think about my offer, jack.}
