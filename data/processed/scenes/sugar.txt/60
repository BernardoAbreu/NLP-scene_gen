<L>__{exterior spring training field day}
<A>__{from the observation tower, we look down over the multiple field spring training complex, where the minor leaguers work out. the vast facilities are triple the size of what we saw in the dominican republic. on the field, miguel, marcos, and jorge stretch out on the grass. jorge, wearing an elastic knee brace, points out a young, african american guy running wind sprints across the field...}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{brad johnson. he just signed for a million dollars out of college.}
<A>__{miguel and marcos watch brad with fascination, searching for some sort of physical representation of his wealth.}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{there's a lot of guys like that. but you can't let that intimidate you. everyone knows dominicans rule the game.}
<A>__{two venezuelan players, orlando mato (23, catcher) and ed poveda (22, center field) step up.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{what's this about dominicans ruling the game?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{no, he must've said venezuelans.}
<A>__{jorge stands up, exchanges hugs with orlando and ed as they continue their debate over which latin country has the best players.}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{sammy, manny, pedro...}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{santana, zambrano, the guillens!}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{are you guys all from the same family?}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{look who's talking... are these your brothers?}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{what, all dominicans look the same, now?}
<A>__{they all smile, stop razzing each other momentarily to meet the new players.}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{this is miguel and marcos. up from boca chica.}
<P>__{(to miguel and marcos)}
<C>__{jorge }
<D>__{orlando and ed. we all played in bridgetown together before i moved up to double a and left these fools behind.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{but you couldn't hang in wichita.}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{i injured my knee, asshole. but i'm healthy now. you'll see.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{fifty bucks you're back in iowa next month.}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{fifty bucks you're still an asshole next month.}
<A>__{they all laugh. on the field later pitching coach, stu sutton (white, 40s), addresses the minor league pitching staff in mid speech.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{you've gotta show us your best game here. remember that, until you reach the top, there's always guys above you, hustling to keep you here. and guys below you pushing to take your job. we have 75 pitchers in this camp competing for less than 50 positions come april 3rd. so you gotta work hard...}
<A>__{while all the players respectfully listen to stu, it is clear that very few of the latino players can understand him.}
<B>__{later on the practice mounds}
<A>__{miguel stretches his arm, while observing another group of pitchers throwing in the bullpen. he stares at them with intensity, sizing up his new competition.}
<B>__{later on the field}
<A>__{miguel faces off against a hitter in a simulated game scenario. one, two, three, he strikes him out on three straight pitches. stu and another coach exchange impressed looks.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{bring over leonard.}
<A>__{the other coach calls over to the adjoining field.}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{bring over leonard!}
<A>__{on the field minutes later on major league all star rob leonard in the batter's box, awaiting miguel's pitch. miguel takes a deep breath, psyches himself up. he puts everything he has into a hearty fastball, which... ...sails right over the plate for a strike, as leonard calmly watches and readies himself for the next one. feeling confident with his stuff, miguel fires in the next pitch, and... whack! leonard sails it over the right field wall. stu sutton smiles at miguel.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{welcome to america, kid.}
