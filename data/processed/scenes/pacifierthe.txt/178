<L>__{interior secret vault}
<A>__{light is at the end. they anxiously tiptoe, reaching... the vault! spare, bright and white. the floor is covered with square tiles. at the far end is a large elevated safe. beside the safe is a red switch, with two settings: armed and disarmed. it's set on armed. the air is filled with an ominous, low pitched hum, like a monstrous computer. bill eyes the safe.}

<D>__{you bring your stethoscope?}
<C>__{mrs. chun}
<D>__{no. but i've got some c4.}
<A>__{she confidently strides toward the safe which sets off hidden flame throwers in the walls. a jet blast of flame shoots out! she leaps back just in time, but the shoulder of her jacket is on fire. bill pats out the flames with his own jacket. chun is bokay, just missing both eyebrows.}
