<A>__{sam longson stands by the window, looking out into the car park. he sees the leeds united players. reads their mood. their faces. their focus. their murderous intent. a flicker of concern on sam longson's face. he thinks, then calls out to his secretary..}
<C>__{longson}
<D>__{get me today's team sheet, will you?}
<A>__{he lets the curtain fall..}
<L>__{interior corridor baseball ground day (1973)}
<A>__{sam longson walks through corridors of elland road, carrying the team sheet. walking towards the dressing rooms. he turns a corner and runs into clough..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{what's up, uncle sam? bit below stairs for you here, isn't it? taken a wrong turn somewhere?}
<C>__{longson}
<D>__{just seen the team sheet. hinton, o'hare, todd, mackay.}
<P>__{(looks left and right)}
<D>__{that's our strongest side.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{of course it's our strongest side. it's leeds united. would you prefer i sent out the apprentices?}
<C>__{longson}
<D>__{we're at juventus mid week. semi final of the european cup. biggest night in the club's history!! couldn't you just field...}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{longson}
<D>__{y'know...}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{a weaker side? am i hearing right? is the chairman of this football club seriously asking his manager to lose?}
<C>__{longson}
<D>__{you know what i mean..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{against their biggest rivals?}
<C>__{longson}
<D>__{the chairman of this football club is asking his manager to be pragmatic. manage his resources. prioritise. we've embarked on a huge program of refurbishment and improvements. new stands. better floodlights. we need a good run in europe to pay for it.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{i'm going to pretend i didn't hear a word of this.}
<A>__{clough turns to walk away. longson calls after him..}
<C>__{longson}
<P>__{(checking watch)}
<D>__{we've still got twenty minutes before kick off. i'd reconsider if i were you. i wouldn't want my employer to be unhappy..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{my employer?}
<C>__{longson}
<D>__{chairman of derby county. and chairman long before you ever showed up.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{that's right. you were chairman of derby county before i came here. i remember that. when derby county were at the fucking foot of the second division, when nobody had heard of them for twenty years and nobody had heard of sam bloody longson ever. full stop. and that's where you'd still fucking be if it wasn't for me; at the foot of the bloody second division, where nobody remembered you and nobody had heard of you. there would be no derby county without me, no league title, no champions of england; not without brian clough.}
<A>__{a door opens and peter taylor walks out in time to hear...}
<C>__{longson}
<D>__{i'm going to give you some good advice, brian clough.}
<P>__{(mo re)}
<C>__{lon gson }
<D>__{no matter how good you think you are, or how clever, or how many fancy new friends you make on the telly, the reality of footballing life is this: the chairman is the boss, then come the directors, then the secretary, then the fans, then the players, and finally, last of all, bottom of the heap, lowest of the low, the one in the end we can all without, is the bloody manager.}
<A>__{longson turns and storms off. taylor looks at clough..}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{what have you done now?}
<A>__{clough doesn't answer, and storms off in the opposite direction. taylor is left alone, visibly anxious.}
