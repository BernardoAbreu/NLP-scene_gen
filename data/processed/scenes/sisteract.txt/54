<L>__{interior convent schoolroom an hour later}
<A>__{a plain whitewashed classroom, with battered student style desks. a group of about eight local teenage girls has gathered. the girls wear extremes of hair, makeup and clothing; they are bored and scruffy, clearly the local bad girls. sister mary patrick is leading the class, in her usual perky manner.}
<C>__{mary patrick}

<A>__{the girls make grunting noises.}

<A>__{angle on the girls, exchanging glances and rolling their eyes. page 38}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{anyone? yes?}

<C>__{mary patrick}
<P>__{(blushing)}

<C>__{lawanda}
<P>__{(goading christy)}
<D>__{how come? sister?}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(still trying to behave)}
<D>__{well... because it's in the bible. "thou shalt not..." thou shalt not.}
<A>__{the girls all laugh and make jeering noises.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{excuse me just what are you all doing here? at sunday school?}
<C>__{lawanda}
<D>__{'cause we love it so damn much. and cause we gotta come here. probation.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{probation?}
<C>__{charlene}
<D>__{yeah. we all got caught. shoplifting. cuttin' school. cuttin' up some bitch with a blade. so we gotta come here. so we'll be good, in the future. so we'll learn valuable lessons. and i learned mine. i will be incredibly good, i will never rip out nobody's nose ring by accident ever again. can i go now?}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(getting fed up)}
<D>__{yeah, you learned a whole lot, i can tell.}
<C>__{lawanda}
<D>__{well, what would you know about it, anyway? what do any of you nunheads know about anything? about doin' the nasty, or gettin' high?}
<C>__{conchita}
<D>__{leave her alone, lawanda, she's just some ol' nun! don't pick on no nun, it's bad luck!}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(fed up)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{all the girls look up, stunned by christy's language.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{okay, so maybe i'm a nun so, you want to ask me something? you want to listen, for once in your little lives? you want to pay some attention?}
<C>__{charlene}
<D>__{what about crack? you a user?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{i said i was a nun, not an asshole.}
<A>__{all the girls jeer at charlene.}
<C>__{keshia}
<D>__{got you, charlene!}
<C>__{conchita}
<D>__{dunked by the nun!}
<C>__{lawanda}
<P>__{(more sincerely)}
<D>__{well, what about the sex stuff? what if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow. like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it. oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{and you listen to that?}
<C>__{lawanda}
<D>__{no, but... i don't know... sometimes.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{hey, i know, it's hard. but do what i do.}
<C>__{lawanda}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{what you do?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{just tell him, i do love you, but i can't i'm a nun.}
<A>__{the girls all laugh; they are really beginning to like christy.}
<C>__{charlene}
<D>__{but, like what if you are doin' it? what about protection? who's responsible?}
<C>__{conchita}
<D>__{what about them things, you know, for the guy? aren't they like, a mess to put on? don't they kinda mess up the mood?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{deal with it, sweet thing. it's important, nowadays. you just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.}
<C>__{mother superior }
<D>__{mary clarence!}
<A>__{mother superior has returned, with mary patrick. everyone has been so wrapped up in the discussion, that no one has noticed their entrance.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(thinking on her feet)}
<D>__{because a banana is part of a balanced breakfast. and don't forget fiber.}
