<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior lancey's room}
<A>__{he is shaving. apparently much stronger but his hand is shaking. he looks at it. it steadies. after a moment he smiles a little.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior bathroom, bill's suite}
<A>__{camera is on the shower door as the sound of running water ceases. the kid can be seen indistinctly through the door.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{reach me a towel?}
<A>__{melba, who is dressed again and applying her lipstick, comes into the shot, takes a towel from a rack and hands it to him after he opens the shower door. he gives himself a quick once over with it, the secures it around his waist, steps out of the shower stall, and begins the process of shaving. melba meanwhile finishes restoring her makeup.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{you any idea how much the shooter has involved in this game of yours?}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{if schlaegel bet as much on me as i heard, i guess he'd pay a nice piece of change to be sure i won.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{it's worse than that. schlaegel staked him for three years. he has his hooks so deep in shooter man, he'll take out his liver when he pulls them out.}
<A>__{the kid stops shaving and looks at her.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{you asking me to go along with the fix?}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{i'm asking you to consider whether your ego is worth destroying another man's whole life.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{you're still working for him. on my time you're still working for him.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{what kind of switch is this? you criticize me for trying to chippie on him, then i get a little loyal and you're at me for that.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{no i don't hold it against you. you wanting to make things right for him but this game i handle my way win, lose, or draw.}
<A>__{there is a knock on the door.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{rolls and coffee for the hard headed hero.}
<A>__{camera pans to take in the view of the bedroom as she crosses it to the door, talking as she goes.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{believe me kid there is too much at stake for us to rely on your doing it on your own.}
<A>__{she has paused at the door to finish her sentence. now she unlocks and opens it to christian. melba is so taken aback she can't do anything but stand there holding the door open. the kid, in the bathroom in f.g., is similarly frozen in his tracks. after a moment christian advances into the room. reverse angle christian in f.g. the scene as it looks to christian is circumstantially incriminating. camera moves with her gaze from the kid to the one mussed bed, to melba. the faces and the silence of the two people are even more incriminating than the circumstances.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{hello, kid. hello, melba.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{you said wait home 'til you let me know.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{yeah, that's what i said. we took a break in the game to catch some sleep. shooter sent his woman up here to wake me up.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{yeah, i woke him up.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{it don't take much.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{no, i didn't find it any trouble.}
<P>__{(awkwardly)}
<D>__{well, you children don't need me, that's for sure. see you downstairs.}
<P>__{(to christian)}
<D>__{you, too, honey, right?}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{i will be around if the kid wants me.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{see you, melba. thanks.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{por nada, as they say. it was nothing.}
<A>__{she walks past camera and a moment later comes the sound of the door closing behind her. the kid, who has moved into the bedroom, crosses to his clothes on a chair, and picks up his undershorts and trousers. he returns to the bathroom, using the door for partial concealment as he removes his towel and puts on his shorts and trousers.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{you been to the place?}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{no, i've got my bag downstairs. maybe i will take it over later on tonight.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{how's your mama and papa?}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{fine. how's the game going?}
<A>__{the kid fastens his trousers and returns to the basin to give his face a last few strokes with the razor and wash off the soap.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{it's come to be just me and lancey.}
<A>__{he comes back into the bedroom to finish dressing. as his movement brings him fairly close to christian, he realizes he hasn't kissed her, and repairs the omission before putting his shirt on.}
<C>__{christian}
<P>__{(after the kiss)}
<D>__{i was wondering.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{i got my mind on the cards.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{i know. and i don't want to rattle you. we got plenty to talk about, but it can all wait. except i want to say this. i came back because i figured if it was going to work with us, it's silly me sitting home with mama while you're playing your big game. i mean if i'm any use to you at all, this is when it's most important.}
<A>__{to the kid preoccupied by the game and the fix, feeling both affection and guilt. the idea that she can be any use to him against lancey is one he can't grasp.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{i'm glad you came, christian. you got as much right here as anybody.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{more right, i should have said.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{should you?}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{hell, yes. the change i come out with when i win this one, you're going to be the one to spend it.}
<A>__{he moves toward the door.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{eric }
<C>__{the kid}
<P>__{(turning back)}
<D>__{look, i said i'm glad you came and that's all until i wrap this up i'm a poker player, remember?}
<A>__{she looks at him. after a moment he exits. she follows.}
