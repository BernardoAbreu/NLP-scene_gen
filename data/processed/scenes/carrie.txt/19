<L>__{18 the house}
<A>__{as still larger stones hail from the sky. and then just as suddenly and inexplicably as they started, they stop.}
<L>__{19 two shot the women}
<A>__{mrs. horan with her hands still over her ears, her daughter standing next to her, transfixed on the lawn. once again, it's quiet.}
<L>__{20 the white house}

<D>__{yes, momma.}
<C>__{margaret's voice}

<A>__{a moment of hesitation on carrie's part, a very slight hint of rebellion, but:}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{i always do, momma.}
<A>__{then she turns, walks to the street, gathering pace, quickening.}
