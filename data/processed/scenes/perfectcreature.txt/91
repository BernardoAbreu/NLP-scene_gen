<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{a shopkeeper heard yelling. went to see, found this. one witness. a prostitute.}
<A>__{jones tosses down a photo. it is freddy, looking suitably scummy in a police identikit photo.}
<C>__{jones}

<D>__{she identified this lovely citizen. we thought maybe he had a grudge or was crazy. i guess we were wrong.}
<A>__{silus stands by the window; lights make patterns on his face.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{it is edgar.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{and now he's got steph. why does he want her?}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{she is not what he was after.}
<A>__{we see lilly slowly getting it.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{steph was staying with me. she was wearing my coat. it was me he was after. wasn't it?}
<A>__{silus now turns, slowly moves towards her, coming out of the shadows. lilly finds it hard to return his gaze, involuntarily touches her neck where it is scarred from edgar's attack. jones is watching all this very carefully.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{yes. he will come for you lilly.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{right, then we put you somewhere safe and set up this place. shooters on the roofs. and when he comes we blow his fucking brains out.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{he will know. he will see and hear it.}
<A>__{lilly is staring at steph's id.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{it has to be me. that's what he wants. it's the only chance steph's got.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{what are you talking about, she's probably dead already...}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{jones! and we can't make it too hard. he has to be able to get in. he can't suspect anything.}
<A>__{jones is shaking his head. silus just stares at lilly.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{that's the way it will be. i'm the bait.}
<A>__{close on silus.}
