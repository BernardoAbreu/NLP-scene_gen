<L>__{interior farmhouse grampa's room night}
<A>__{in a cramped, darkened room we see the huge shape of tiny hovering over a bed containing the hunched, fragile old body of grampa. grampa struggles to sit, then slowly slides his legs over the edge of the bed. tiny helps him to stand.}

<D>__{god damn it, i can do it. i can do it myself, ya big monkey. i ain't dead yet... so don't you and your sister start counting out my money yet.}
<A>__{grampa steadies himself against tiny. they slowly walk out of the room.}
<C>__{grampa}
<D>__{god damn, my dogs are barking.}
<A>__{as they move into the light of the hallway, it is clear that grampa is in his late 80's. grampa quickly grows tired. tiny picks him up in his arms and carries him down the stairs to the dining room. as they move past, the camera comes to rest on a strange object sitting on a shelf. a large glass jar containing a deformed baby. the pickled punk looks to have a small second head growing from its temple. the label on the jar reads stuffy 1973. the sound from the tv fades up in the background. bela lugosi's voice can be heard.}
<C>__{bela lugosi }
<D>__{your hands, please. your left hand shows your past...}
