<L>__{exterior jail night}
<A>__{the town's in complete chaos. there are fires everywhere. still stunned and bleeding, brandt looks from where he lies on the ground as... gordy bursts out of the inferno carrying armstrong. they're singed and smoking, but they're alive. gordy drops armstrong, pats himself and armstrong down, knocking out the burning embers on their clothes and hair, when... gordy's eyes meet brandt's. the two men hold the look for a moment. if brandt could speak, he'd be yelling at gordy to stop, not to go on. and gordy knows it. but gordy's not stopping. picks up armstrong again and moves off toward the waterfront.}
