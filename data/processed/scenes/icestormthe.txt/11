<L>__{interior school party. night}
<A>__{paul, francis and friends enter the dark, crowded room. various kids are awkwardly dancing to some progressive fm style undanceable rock (jethro tull, etc.) francis hands paul the tail end of a joint, but paul waves it away.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no more man. i'm about to drop as it is.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{see ya.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{where you going?}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{paul, let me enlighten you about something. you and i exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. i'm off to get laid. see you.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{flame on, asshole.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{and remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.}
<A>__{he waves his fingers toward paul's eyes, in the classic "stoned" gesture, then wanders off. paul looks on at the gathering. marge waves to him from the dance floor.}
