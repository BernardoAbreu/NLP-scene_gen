<A>__{high shot showing progress of party, still crowded, still high. if we look sharp we can see charlie seated on the floor in the rear of the shot, his back against the wall. closer shot of charlie sitting morosely, back against the wall, regarding his drink with sodden eyes. the chatter of the party, an occasional shrill laugh. full shot of eddie coming out of the kitchen, carrying two drinks. he picks his way through the people to the living room with the general intention of getting to the arrangement of divans around the coffee table, when he spots charlie and moves across to him.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{hey, what's the matter, charlie?}
<P>__{(squats down beside charlie)}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{let's get out of here, eddie.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{the last time i saw you, you was with that girl you picked up. what happened?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{she's over there talking to that old guy with the glasses.}
<A>__{their point of view, the existentialist on steps with landlord.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i didn't like her. she's one of these real greenwich village phonies. if i added up all the guys she told me about, she must have had her first boy friend when she was two years old. where are you going, eddie. stick around a minute.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(who has stood)}
<D>__{i'm with that one over there not bad, huh? i think she's a communist. i think she's trying to talk me into joining the party.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{how are you making out?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{not so hot. i may have to join.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hang around. let's talk a bit.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i better get back. she's liable to recruit somebody else.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{where's arnold?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{he's in the kitchen. i think he's out cold. i will see you.}
<A>__{charlie nods as eddie moves off. he returns his morose attention back to his glass of liquor. then his eyes close, and his face, though impassive, shows pain. after a moment, he opens his eyes and slowly clambers to his feet and makes his way, a little unsteadily, through the living room in the direction of the kitchen. in the background we can hear the piano and somebody singing indistinguishable lyrics. charlie gets to the kitchen door and looks in. arnold is at the tiny kitchen table, head on the table, out cold. the kitchen is in a state of havoc.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey arnold you okay, arnold?}
<A>__{arnold makes no answer. charlie regards his prostrated friend expressionlessly for a moment. then turns and shuffles aimlessly back to the group around the piano in the living room. he looks over to the stairway again. the existentialist is alone now, the landlord having gone for the moment. she is looking at charlie, and he drops his eyes. he turns away from the piano and moves out a few steps into the middle of the living room. he moves to the stairway. the existentialist looks up at him as he approaches, charlie kind of nods to her, and, for a moment, she just sits and he just stands. then ...}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<D>__{that old man i was talking to before? that's my landlord. about ten thirty last night, someone began pounding on my door. so i got up and opened the door, and there was this white haired man with a pince nez standing there. i said: "what do you want?" so he said: "i'm the landlord, and i want the rent." well, i just looked at him because the landlord i knew was a hungarian man named frank, who was crazy about me, and the issue of rent never came up, you see. well, it turned out that this man with the pince nez had just bought the building the day before and he kept grabbing my arm and saying he wanted the rent. well, then i got the point, of course. well, meanwhile, a boy named bob i knew had come over. he's engaged to a javanese girl with wonderful planes in her face who lives at the international house. but he's crazy about me and he drops in about twice a week. well, meanwhile, my new landlord was grabbing my arm and kept quoting poetry to me which he was trying to pass off as his own. he was an absolute fraud. he scotched the whole thing from baudelaire. "tu mettrais." you know that one. well, he kept screaming about the rent i didn't like him, you know and i called this boy named george who used to live in poughkeepsie when i was going to vassar, and he's crazy about me. he lives in st. luke's place now, but he goes to poughkeepsie every wednesday to see his mother, he's got an oedipus, so that was out. well, my new landlord kept telling me how much he was in love with me. i said: "how existentialist can you get? you just met me five minutes ago." he was absolutely crazy about me.}
<A>__{charlie has been sort of half listening to all this. his attention, if any at all, has been vaguely given to the girl's bare arms, the lines of her body.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{you have an apartment around here somewheres?}
<P>__{(looks up to second floor)}
<D>__{what's up there? what kind of rooms are up there?}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<D>__{so, i finally got to sleep around six thirty....}
<A>__{charlie bends down to her, takes her arm.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{come on, let's go.}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<P>__{(wrenching her arm away)}
<D>__{no! oh, stop trying to be so primitive.}
<A>__{charlie straightens with an irritated sigh.}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<D>__{i find you very unpleasant.}
<A>__{he stands, she sits in sullen silence.}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<D>__{there's nothing upstairs.}
<P>__{(suddenly rises, mumbles)}
<D>__{oh, i don't care.}
<A>__{she starts up the stairs, charlie following close behind her. they pick their way past the other people sitting on the stairs to the second floor landing. they walk in hostile silence down the landing to the bedroom door, which she opens.}
