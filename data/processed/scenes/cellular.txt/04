<T>__{we push into its doors:}
<L>__{interior darkened attic kidnappers' safehouse}
<A>__{a door crashes open. light slices through the dark revealing the dusty, skeletal interior. jessica is hurled into the room and falls to the floor. with bound hands, she frantically pulls her blindfold off to see the lead ski masked kidnapper standing in front of her. sturdier than the rest. solid. imposing.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{wh... what do you want?}
<A>__{unsettlingly, the kidnapper says nothing, staring at her. jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze... then suddenly, the kidnapper turns and exits the room. jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her throat as he returns ten seconds later with a baseball bat. grim as death, he stalks toward her }
<C>__{jessica }
<D>__{no, wait..}
<A>__{and reaching.her, he hauls back and swings }
<C>__{jessica }
<D>__{no! please }
<A>__{smash! the bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above jessica's head, obliterating the rotary dial telephone that hung there. as phone guts shower down on her, the lead kidnapper turns and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking jessica in the darkness. only now that they're gone does jessica allow her fear to show through. trembling, tears running down her face, jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic }
<C>__{jessica }
<D>__{wha... what the hell is happening?!}
<A>__{the attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.}
