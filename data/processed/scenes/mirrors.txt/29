<L>__{interior early evening house bathroom}
<A>__{in the bathtub, daisy and michael cannot avoid overhearing their parents arguing. in denial, michael blocks his ears with his hands and lies back under the water... back in the bedroom amy seems distrustful of ben, scared of how close he is to the edge. we can see the anger in his eyes...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{look at yourself. you're still carrying around so much of that anger.}
<A>__{he catches a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror and of the desperate violence in his eyes... ben steps back.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(trying to calm down)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i didn't mean to yell at you... things could be so different between us.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{yes i know, but it's up to you ben.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yeah... anyway, i wasn't planning on staying. my shift starts in an hour. i will just kiss them goodbye and then i'm leaving.}
<A>__{ben exits the room. amy is left alone through the window, she watches ben exit the house and get into his car. when she turns away, she discovers michael and daisy standing outside the bathtub dripping wet in their towels. she smiles, and quickly comes to dry them.}
