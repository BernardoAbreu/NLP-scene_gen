<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{sharon is drying her hands in the bar's bathroom, staring into the mirror. no smile now. we see into her mind for a second. flashback man pointing the gun at her face today. back to sharon (present) in the mirror and see how shaken she still is.}
<B>__{on catch}
<A>__{a waitress is leaving his table, and he looks back at sharon's booth and sees that she still isn't there. he starts to turn, and then freezes as he hears...}
<C>__{sharon }
<D>__{there you are.}
<A>__{she has stepped out of the bathroom and spotted him. he is surprised, face to face now.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{we thought you wouldn't show. why you sitting here?}
<A>__{he shrugs.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i don't talk to a lot of people. would you...?}
<A>__{he half rises and gestures to the other chair. she glances back at her booth, then sits. she's nervous, too.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i didn't have a chance to thank you. i'm sharon pogue.}
<A>__{she puts out her hand. he stares at that hand for just half a beat before taking it. they shake. the feel of her hand holding his evokes the memory of the accident, but he covers this.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you look familiar.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i guess i live on the beat you patrol.}
<A>__{her way to cover nervousness is to be blunt, even tough.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{why would you do that jump a man with a gun?}
<C>__{catch}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{he was going to shoot you.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{he could've shot you. you have a death wish? you a bungee jumper?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{no. i didn't have time to think about it.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{what d'you think about it now?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i figure... it was worth the risk.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{for someone you don't even know?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{yeah and for what you do. i think cops are great. out there, trying to keep it safe. you know? tough job. firemen are everybody's heroes. kids wave at firemen. people should wave at cops. did you ever think about how many people are walking around this town because you saved them?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i never thought about it.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{... because you helped them or because you arrested somebody who would've hurt them or because you just... did your job?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{now i'm walking around this town because of you. ever think about that? maybe you should be a cop.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i don't know... i look pretty dumb in a hat...}
<A>__{he has made her smile.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{... and i don't drive and, like i said, i don't talk to many people. am i talking too much? i am. you go ahead.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{okay. what d'you do? you employed around here? oh, god. sorry. every time i try to talk to somebody, it comes out like an interrogation.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{where do you want to be ten years from now?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{somebody taught that to me. kind of a shortcut. you ask somebody, what are your plans for tomorrow what're your dreams for ten years from now. it's supposed to get things started.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{does it work?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i never tried it.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{no. really. i just remembered it god is my witness.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{not in here. it's mostly cops.}
<A>__{now she has made him smile, the first real smile we've seen from catch. it's open and real and she is charmed by it.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you have a nice smile.}
<A>__{she's a bit self conscious, saying that, and just as she says it, the waitress arrives with shots and beers for both of them. sharon looks up, questioning, and the waitress nods toward the booth. catch and sharon see the cops, staring, smiling, raising their glasses. there is a hint of teasing in their grins. and now sharon is more self conscious, and a bit tough again, taking her drink and turning back to catch.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{so... what were we talking about? oh, yeah, you were giving me some line about starting a conversation.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{the shortcut.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{okay. i will play.}
<A>__{they clink glasses and drink. then...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{tomorrow i've got a night watch shift. if the weather clears, in the morning i will go hiking. if it rains, i will go to the gym and the laundromat. ten years from now... i want to be living in some mountainous place.}
<C>__{catch}

<A>__{but now ray juliette is approaching the table.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hey, pogo don't keep him all to yourself. come on over, lambert, join the group. we'll buy you dinner, give you a medal for saving pogo's ass.}
<A>__{sharon drains her shot and stands.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{actually, i'm kind of tired, ray. i'm taking off.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{oh. i will... walk you to your car.}
<A>__{catch stands and turns to ray.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{thanks for the drink.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{least we could do. we don't like her very much but we don't want to lose her.}
<A>__{sharon frowns and waves to the booth of cops. ray smiles and shakes hands with catch as a good bye.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{take care.}
<A>__{and catch and sharon leave.}
