<A>__{brian pulls off jennifer's stockings. as she kicks it away...}
<L>__{interior high rise upper floor night}
<A>__{the elevator stops. ding. the door opens. no howling blaze, not even any noise, but enough hanging smoke that you can't see your hand in front of your face. they fan out gingerly onto the floor, looking for the fire. hide and seek in a white fog bank. everybody stops and listens. slowly, carefully, they feel their way through the haze.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{it's here.}
<A>__{on cue something snakes past behind the walls, whispers and whines and shivers up and over them and then is silent. grindle attaches a hoseline to the building standpipe.}
<C>__{grindle}
<D>__{these high rise gigs give me the creeps.}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{let's wait for a back up, stephen. we're early on this one, it hasn't even broke out yet. we're one short as it is with brian gone.}
<A>__{but stephen's on the hunt now. obsessed.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{want to learn something?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{yes sir!}
<A>__{stephen and tim take the lead, their axes gripped like shotguns. grindle backs them up with a charged hoseline.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{adcox, go with pengelly and check the other side.}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{it isn't safe, man. don't go splittin' us up. not with this one.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{ what the hell's the matter with you? you always check the other side. i haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? we got a job here.}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{let me take the lead, stephen...}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{goddamn it adcox! just do your fucking job!}
<A>__{adcox folds. with a stricken look on his face he takes his crew down the other way. stephen and tim slowly feel their way.}
<B>__{crack}
<A>__{everybody spins around in terror. nothing. something inhuman giggles down ahead of them. stephen smiles.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(like a mantra)}
<D>__{oh, you're so very sly, but so am i...}
<P>__{(to tim)}
<D>__{...listen to it... you can tell when a wall cracks which way it's gonna jump... you can hear the doors breathe if they're hot...}
<A>__{tim looks confused. he doesn't get it. they come to a side door. stephen runs his hand down the jam, feels for heat. then he steps back, takes a deep breath, and crashes the door down with one axe blow. quiet inside.}
