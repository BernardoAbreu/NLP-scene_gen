<L>__{exterior park. day}
<A>__{typical weather, neither good nor bad. the park is nondescript arid green with a few bushes. this is not kew gardens. renton and sick boy appear, dressed as before but for the addition of cheap sunglasses. renton is carrying a battered old cassette player and a carry out in a plastic bag. sick boy is carrying a small, tatty suitcase from oxfam. they scan the horizon and give each other the nod. they walk towards the bushes.}

<D>__{the down side of coming off junk was that i knew i would need to mix with my friends again in a state of full consciousness. it was awful: they reminded me so much of myself i could hardly bear to look at them. take sick boy, for instance, he came off junk at the same time as me, not because he wanted too, you understand, but just to annoy me, just to show me how easily he could do it, thereby downgrading my own struggle. sneaky fucker, don't you think? and when all i wanted to do was lie along and feel sorry for myself, he insisted on telling me once again about his unifying theory of life.}
