<D>__{the magic bullet enters the president's back, headed downward at an angle of 17 degrees. it then moves upward in order to leave kennedy's body from the front of his neck his neck wound number two where it waits 1.6 seconds, turns right and continues into connally's body at the rear of his right armpit wound number three. then, the bullet heads downward at an angle of 27 degrees, shattering connally's fifth rib and leaving from the right side of his chest wounds four and five. the bullet continues downward and then enters connally's right wrist wound number six shattering the radius bone. it then enters his left thigh wound number seven from which it later falls out and is found in almost "pristine" condition on a stretcher in a corridor of parkland hospital.}

<D>__{take a look at ce 856, an identical bullet fired through the wrist of a human cadaver just one of the bones smashed by the magic bullet. yet the government says it can prove this with some fancy physics in a nuclear laboratory. of course they can. theoretical physics can prove an elephant can hang from a cliff with it's tail tied to a daisy, but use your eyes your common sense }
<P>__{(he holds the bullet)}
<D>__{seven wounds, skin, bone. this single bullet explanation is the foundation of the warren commission's claim of a lone assassin. and once you conclude the magic bullet could not create all seven of those wounds, you have to conclude there was a fourth shot and a second rifleman. and if there was a second rifleman, there had to be a conspiracy, which we believe involved the accused clay shaw. fifty one witnesses, gentlemen of the jury, thought they heard shots coming from the grassy knoll, which is to the right and front of the president.}
