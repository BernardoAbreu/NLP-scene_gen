<L>__{interior courtroom}
<B>__{on the door}
<A>__{as ted enters, looks around. mrs. willewska sits in one of the back rows, wearing her best easter hat. ted pauses by her, thanks her for coming. several rows in front of her is thelma. ted crosses to her, they talk quietly between themselves for a few moments. then ted moves on to a table at the front of the room where john shaunessy waits.}
<B>__{on the doors at the back of the courtroom}
<A>__{as they swing open and joanna, along with her lawyer, a mr. gressen. the camera pans with them as they walk to the front of the room and take their seats at the table opposite ted and his lawyer.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{oyez, oyez... the third circuit court of the state of new york, judge atkins presiding is now in session. all rise...}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{as the judge enters, takes his seat. opening business of the court.}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{as gressen (joanna's lawyer) gets to his feet.}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{your honor. as our first witness i would like to call joanna kramer.}
<B>__{two shot ted and shaunessy}
<A>__{the lawyer leans across to ted.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<P>__{(stage whisper)}
<D>__{real direct. motherhood... they're going right for the throat.}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{as joanna gets to her feet, crosses to the witness stand and is sworn in. note: throughout the following, we continually cross cut : to ted kramer, leaning forward, listening intently. it becomes evident that, in spite of himself, there are moments he feels great compassion for joanna.}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{now then, mrs. kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{six years.}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{and would you describe those years as happy?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{the first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{mrs. kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex husband?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{no, i did not.}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{did you wish to?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{yes. i tried to talk to ted my ex husband about it, but he wouldn't listen. he refuses to discuss it in any serious way. i remember one time he said i probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby sitter for billy.}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{tell me, mrs. kramer, are you employed at the present time?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{yes, i work for jantzen as a sportswear designer.}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{and what is your present salary?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{i make thirty one thousand dollars a year.}
<B>__{reaction ted}
<A>__{stunned.}
<C>__{gressen}
<P>__{(switching tactics)}
<D>__{mrs. kramer, do you love your child?}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(emphatically)}
<D>__{yes. very much.}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{and yet you chose to leave him?}
<A>__{there is a long pause, then:}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(speaking carefully, with great thought)}
<D>__{yes... look, during the last five years we were married, i had... i was getting more and more... unhappy, more and more frustrated. i needed to talk to somebody. i needed to find out if it was me, if i was going crazy or what. but every time i turned to ted my ex husband, he couldn't handle it. he became very... i don't know, very threatened. i mean, whenever i would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack. anyway, we became more and more separate... more and more isolated from one another. finally, i had no other choice, i had to leave. and because of my ex husband's attitude his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, i had come to have almost no self esteem...}
<P>__{(with feeling)}
<D>__{at the time i left, i sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me that my son would be better off without me. it was only when i got to california and started into therapy i began to realize i wasn't a terrible person. and that just because i needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.}
<C>__{gressen}
<P>__{(to the judge)}
<D>__{your honor, i would like to place in evidence a report on mrs. kramer's therapy by her therapist, dr. elinore freedman of la jolla, california.}
<A>__{and with that he hands both the judge and shaunessy a thick sheaf of papers. then, turning his attention back to joanna:}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{mr. kramer, why did you set up residence in new york?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{because my son is here. and his father is here. as a mother, i don't want my child to be separated from his father.}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{mrs. kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?}
<A>__{there is a pause, then:}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{because he's my child... because i love him. i know i left my son, i know that's a terrible thing to do. believe me, i have to live with that every day of my life. but just because i'm a woman, don't i have a right to the same hopes and dreams as a man? don't i have a right to a life of my own? is that so awful? is my pain any less just because i'm a woman? are my feelings any cheaper? i left my child i know there is no excuse for that. but since then, i have gotten help. i have worked hard to become a whole human being. i don't think i should be punished for that. i don't think my son should be punished for that. billy's only six. he needs me. i'm not saying he doesn't need his father, but he needs me more. i'm his mother.}
<A>__{there is a beat of silence, then:}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{thank you, mrs. kramer. i have no further questions.}
<B>__{on shaunessy}
<A>__{as he stands, collects his papers from the table and, taking his own sweet time, crosses to joanna.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{now then, mrs. kramer, you said you were married seven years. is that correct?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{in all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{a heavy drinker?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{was he unfaithful?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{did he ever fail to provide for you?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<P>__{(wry smile)}
<D>__{well, i can certainly understand why you left him.}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{objection.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<P>__{(switching his line of questioning)}
<D>__{how long do you plan to live in new york, mrs. kramer?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{permanently.}
<A>__{note: during the early part of shaunessy's cross examination, joanna has been very forthright, very sure of herself. now, as he starts getting tougher, she begins to falter.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{permanently?}
<P>__{(smiles, like a shark smiles)}
<D>__{mrs. kramer, how many boy friends have you had permanently?}
<B>__{on joanna}
<A>__{her head snaps back as though she's been hit.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{i don't recall.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<P>__{(boring in)}
<D>__{how many lovers have you had permanently?}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(looks toward gressen for help)}
<D>__{i don't recall.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{more than three, less than thirty three permanently?}
<B>__{on gressen}
<A>__{he is again on his feet, outraged.}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{objection!}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{overruled. the witness will answer, please.}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(almost a whisper)}
<D>__{somewhere in between.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{do you have a lover now?}
<C>__{gressen}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{objection!}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<P>__{(to the judge)}
<D>__{your honor, i would request a direct answer to a direct question. does she have a lover?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i will allow that. the witness will answer please.}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{is that... permanent?}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(by now she is becoming thoroughly rattled)}
<D>__{i... i don't know...}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{then, we don't really know, do we, when you say "permanently" if you're planning to remain in new york, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent.}
<A>__{on the petitioner's table gressen jumps to his feet.}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{objection! i must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{sustained.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<P>__{(a new attack)}
<D>__{mrs. kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?}
<C>__{gressen}
<P>__{(red in the face)}
<D>__{objection!}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{sustained.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{i will ask it another way. what was the longest personal relationship you have had in your life other than parents and girlfriends?}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(rattled)}
<D>__{ah... i guess i'd have to say... with my child.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<P>__{(wonder, irony)}
<D>__{whom you've seen twice in a year? mrs. kramer, your ex husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{i suppose...}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{would you speak up, mrs. kramer? i couldn't hear you.}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{how long was that?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{we were married two years before the baby. and then four very difficult years.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{so, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.}
<C>__{gressen}
<D>__{objection!}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{overruled.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{i was not a failure.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{oh? what do you call it then a success? the marriage ended in divorce.}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(so angry she forgets her cool)}
<D>__{i consider it less my failure than his.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<P>__{(seizes on this)}
<D>__{congratulations, mrs. kramer. you have just rewritten matrimonial law. you were both divorced, mrs. kramer.}
<C>__{gressen}
<P>__{(on his feet)}
<D>__{objection!}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<P>__{(to the judge)}
<D>__{your honor, i'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?}
<P>__{(to joanna)}
<D>__{mrs. kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?}
<B>__{close on joanna}
<A>__{who sits silently.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{please answer the question, mrs. kramer.}
<C>__{joanna}
<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{it did not succeed.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<P>__{(suddenly fierce)}
<D>__{not it... not it, mrs. kramer you. were you a failure at the most important personal relationship of your life?}
<B>__{closer in on joanna}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{were you?}
