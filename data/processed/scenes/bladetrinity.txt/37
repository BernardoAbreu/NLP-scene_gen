<P>__{(on screen)}
<D>__{that was just a taste of the mayhem that occurred during tonight's brazen shoot out that left at least four people dead. now apparently an anonymous citizen captured the whole event on video }
<A>__{the image freezes. we hear the clatter of keyboard keys as we pan over to an adjacent computer monitor where a series of video captures of the event flash by us in slide show mode. agent ray cumblerland studies the screen. ray is a career agent. dedicated and dogged to the point of annoyance, utterly humorless. his office is cramped and institutional, devoid of any personal touches. it's also overflowing with files, photographs, and charts concerning blade and whistler.}
<B>__{a bulletin board}
<A>__{features numerous surveillance photos of blade and whistler in action, along with various news clippings and two wanted posters ("unlawful flight to avoid prosecution murder, aggravated kidnapping, armed violence"). most of the photos are blurry and indistinct akin to snaps taken of bigfoot.}
<C>__{hale }
<D>__{ray! heard we've got a lead!}
<A>__{wilson hale (20s), ray's subordinate, rushes in, excited. ray stands, ripping down a photo of blade and whistler.}
