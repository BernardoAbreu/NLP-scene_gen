<L>__{exterior outside the treasury department, washington morning}
<A>__{a new flagpole is being dedicated. lincoln, in a black overcoat and his stovepipe hat, and treasury secretary william fessenden, 59, stand by the pole. they face an audience of officials, clerks, dignitaries, wives, soldiers. a marine band finishes a jaunty instrumental rendition of "we are coming father abra'am." two soldiers fasten a flag to the halyards. lincoln moves into place; as the crowd applauds, he takes a sheet of paper from inside his hat and glances at it. then he looks up.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{the part assigned to me is to raise the flag, which, if there be no fault in the machinery, i will do, and when up, it will be for the people to keep it up.}
<A>__{he puts the paper away. the audience waits, expecting more.}
<C>__{lincoln }
<D>__{that's my speech.}
<A>__{he smiles at them. they applaud, some laughing. as lincoln turns the crank, hoisting the flag, a solo trumpet plays "we are coming father abra'am" and the audience joins in. among them, secretary of state william seward, 64, in a thick, exquisite winter coat and hat, and lincoln's dapper assistant secretary, john hay, 27. seward looks pleased.}
<C>__{audience}
<D>__{"we are coming, father abra'am, three hundred thousand more, from mississippi's winding stream and from new england's shore..." we leave our plows and workshops, our wives and children dear, with hearts too full for utterance, with but a silent tear. we're coming father abra'am..."}
