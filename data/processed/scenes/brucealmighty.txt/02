<L>__{interior bruce and grace's apartment night}
<A>__{bruce is with his longtime girlfriend, grace. she has a box of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them into a photo album.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{so, what do you think?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's good.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{it sucks. it's a story about a cookie. people with eating disorders will be riveted,}
<P>__{(goes into huge pathetic fan character)}
<D>__{dear bruce, love the bakery piece. i can't wait to vomit so i can make room for more cookies.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i thought it was funny. i love the hair net. how'd you get it to do that?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what? i'm cutting that. they made me wear that stupid thing. i don't even look like myself. the hair is one of the most important parts of an on camera persona. right out of the gate, i lost the hair advantage.}
<A>__{grace looks at a photo,}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh, my gosh, look at this one. my sister is so drunk.}
<A>__{she places it in the album.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{grace. try to stay focused here. i need your help.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{aren't you taking this a little too seriously?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{it's sweeps grace. it is serious. there's an anchor job open. this is important. this is our future!}
<A>__{bruce points to the tv as he says "future," not realizing he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the hair net bun. grace can't help but giggle.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{bruce collapses into grace's arms like a child. he clearly has a fragile temperament.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{i'm never going to get anchor doing these kind of assignments. i want my work to matter.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it does matter. you're funny. you make people smile. come on, take a break, help me put this album together.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(reluctant)}
<D>__{alright.}
<A>__{grace holds up a photo.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh look at this. it's the first day we moved in together.}
<A>__{it's the two of them, younger, laughing.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(down)}
<D>__{yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh, here's me at my sister's wedding. i caught the bouquet.}
<A>__{it's a picture of grace overpowering the other bridesmaids for the bouquet.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{you look pretty intense, hun.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{well, i was thinking about you.}
<A>__{grace cuddles into bruce.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{so, you're attracted to me in some way, is that what you're trying to say?}
<A>__{grace rolls over onto bruce.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you have no idea.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i was saving myself for the wedding night, but if you keep this up, i may lose my resolve.}
<A>__{grace stands, pulling bruce up.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{well, that's the way the cookie crumbles.}
<A>__{they kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{hey, that's a good line, but you need more resonance. from the diaphragm.}
<P>__{(newscaster voice)}
<D>__{that's the way the cookie crumbles.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh, say it again.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(bigger)}
<D>__{that's the way the cookie crumbles.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(sweet, southern groupie)}
<D>__{oh, i just love on air personalities.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(newscaster voice)}
<D>__{well then, let me take these clothes off and slip into my hair net.}
<A>__{grace laughs, bruce joins in as they disappear into the bedroom.}
