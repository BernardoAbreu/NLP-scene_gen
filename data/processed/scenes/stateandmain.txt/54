<D>__{now what is this, you sonofabitch! because if you haven't heard about the laws of malicious prosecution, you're about to. don't flinch while i'm talking to you, you two bit speedtrap fraud: there's an old saying, two scariest things in the world, a black man with a knife and a jew with a lawyer. now, i am a lawyer, and i am the jew, and you continue one moment with this slanderous shit here in this public place, i'm going to have your ass over my mantleplace. the kid was not in the car, she says that she wasn't in the car, no one says she wasn't in the car, no one says that she was in the car, you have no corpus and you have no case, and you know it. so i'm not paying patsy with you here, you motherfucker. look in my eyes: i made eleven million bucks last year and i don't like being trifled with. now i think that the better part of valor, though we've got your back up here...the better part of valor is to step away. or, before g d, i will see you disbarred.}
