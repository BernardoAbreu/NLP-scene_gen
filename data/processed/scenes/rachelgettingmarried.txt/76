<A>__{the exotic tent looks beautiful out there in the sprawling backyard, reflections of the pool lights shimmering off its sides. the whole backyard is enchanted with magically deployed twinkle lights, japanese lanterns and other special lighting effects adding to the aura... "rachel loves sidney" is being played in a mellow, super romantic trumpet solo mode now by christian scott. an assorted bunch of guests have relocated to the poolside patio in their finery. the oxygen guy and his matronly wife are seated on a transplanted living room couch, talking intently to a be feathered headdressed dancer. norman sklear and emma are sharing a stylish, quietly triumphant slow dance, whispering punctuated by gusts of laughter. angela paylin is out there too. little kids are running around the lawn and a few are playing with olive the dog. kym kneels at the far corner of the swimming pool, unnoticed by anyone. a wooden serving tray floats on the surface of the water, supporting a candle wrapped in rice paper. a couple of smaller candles surround the slightly larger one. kym lights the candles, extinguishes the match, gently slides the illuminated tray out towards the center of the pool, watches. kym rises and walks towards the house, looking for something.}
