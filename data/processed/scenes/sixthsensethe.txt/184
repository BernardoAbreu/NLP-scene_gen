<A>__{anna rushes across the room to a crumpled malcolm laying on the floor. malcolm's hands are clutched at his side. anna pries his hands away to reveal the tiniest tear in his shirt. anna's eyes catch something dark moving... a pool of blood is forming under malcolm. she slowly turns him over on his side... a horrific sight... an enormous exit wound on his lower back pours out blood uncontrollably. malcolm's jaw is locked open. his breaths are long and strained. anna is screaming, but her voice sounds far away. malcolm's open jaw releases a long strained breath and then becomes silent. anna tries to cover the wound with her hands desperately.}
