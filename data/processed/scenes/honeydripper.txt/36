<L>__{exterior 1st cotton field afternoon}
<A>__{blazing hot. cotton chaff in the air as the prison work gang bend to their task, dragging long sacks behind them like snakes. even the deputies are sweating rivulets as they stand by with their shotguns in hand. sonny is way behind the others, not dressed for the work, wincing as he pricks his fingers for the umpteenth time. ned, a little prisoner picking his way back in the opposite direction in a parallel row, takes pity on him }
