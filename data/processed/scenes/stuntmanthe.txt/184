<L>__{interior garage late night low angle on the black duesenberg}
<A>__{which stands alone like moby dick awaiting its victim. chuck and cameron appear from behind the car, stalking it like it were the sunday special on a used car lot, chuck the "hearty" salesman, cameron the reluctant customer.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{look at this mother...i will bet these guys could build an arabian out of a jackass.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{why not? you built a stunt man out of one.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{stunt man? three days and you've already grown those big brass balls? jump up and down and let me hear 'em clang, and then do me a favor and leave 'em home for this gag.}
<P>__{(yanks open the door)}
<D>__{there's just enough room in that duesenberg for a normal guy...who thinks!}
<P>__{(cameron slides in)}
<D>__{show me how long you can hold your breath.}
<A>__{cameron inhales deeply and chuck clicks his stopwatch.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{now, look around. whaddya see?...no roll bar in the roof. that's because the roof caving in really looks gassy on film. you got your protection in the back of the seat...steel sheeting. if the roof goes too far, you get your goddamn head down quick! you listening to me?!...nod your head.}
<P>__{(slapping cameron on back)}
<D>__{you got good lungs.}
<P>__{(buckles cameron's seatbelt)}
<D>__{you got no shoulder harness because it would show on camera. so when you hit the water, you brace yourself against the steering wheel. it's reinforced. you couldn't break it loose with dynamite...you gettin' light headed yet?}
<A>__{cameron shakes his head, "no."}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{keep your hands off the doors... you're leaving through the window. you lower them slowly as you sink to equalize the pressure. what are you waitin' for? i'm not gonna be down there holding your hand.}
<P>__{(cameron lowering windows)}
<D>__{slower. when you hit bottom, the windows are open and you're gonna make like a minnow. but first, a little fresh air wouldn't hurt. you reach down under the seat and, what do you know, a respirator...make like you're reaching for it. there'll be one there tomorrow.}
<A>__{cameron reaches for the non existent respirator.}
<C>__{chuck }
<D>__{no, keep your face forward, the camera is behind you and it's still running.}
<A>__{by this time, cameron's breath is giving out and he's struggling to hold it.}
<C>__{chuck }
<D>__{you feel like your lungs are gonna burst? good. that's the way you're supposed to act like you feel. the moment that water gets above your nose, you gotta look like you're drowning. remember? burt wasn't so good at that.}
<A>__{that knocks the wind out of cameron.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{he sure as hell convinced me.}
<A>__{chuck clicks his stopwatch and scowls.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{things happen crossin' the street! if somethin' goes cockeyed...screw the scene! get that mask on. there's enough oxygen to get you to china.}
<P>__{(rolls up the window)}
<D>__{we'll try it again.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(still panting)}
<D>__{let me catch my breath.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what you'll catch is a lungful of water! you're at the bottom of the river!...you breathe when i goddamn tell you to breathe!}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(the pupil tricking the teacher)}
<D>__{hey, chuck, you blind?...can't you see i've got my respirator on?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you just goddamn remember you don't have gills!!}
