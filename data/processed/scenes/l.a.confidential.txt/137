<A>__{exley's had it. a menacing step forward. lynn's smile becomes a laugh. lost to himself, exley leans in and kisses her. lynn pulls back, then kisses back. in a beat, they're rolling to the floor, shedding clothes. as they trash the furniture, lynn looks over his shoulder at her own reflection in a closet door mirror. reverse angle inside closet two way glass. sid hudgeons is in here snapping pictures. as lynn and exley continue with their frantic lovemaking...}
