<L>__{interior the farmhouse kitchen later night}
<A>__{surgical implements are laid out on a clean cloth. scalpel, forceps, a clamp, a sponge, medical thread and needles. we pull back to reveal: sam, stretched out on the kitchen table. around him we see vincent and jean pierre, who are wearing rubber gloves and examining sam's wound. jean pierre holds a mirror up so that sam can see what's going on. sam, with his medical training, is treating himself.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{it's right there, beneath the surface. i can just make it out.}
<A>__{sam is in terrible pain, but necessity dictates that he focus on what's going on so that he can talk vincent through this next procedure.}
<D>__{jean pierre are you sure you won't have a drink?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{no booze...pain's in the mind, and the mind i can control.}
<P>__{(quick beat)}
<D>__{alright, let's do it.}
<A>__{during this next sequence, we cut back and forth : between sam's reactions to the surgery, and the mirror itself where he's watching.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{douse the wound with alcohol.}
<A>__{vincent pours a healthy splash of rubbing alcohol onto the wound and sam grits his teeth as the pain explodes up his central nervous system.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to jean pierre)}
<D>__{take that sponge and wipe away as much of the blood as you can, keep it clean so i can see.}
<A>__{jean pierre does as sam says, wiping away the blood that keeps filling the wound. throughout the procedure jean pierre will do this; every time the sponge is saturated he squeezes the excess blood into a bucket which sits on the floor, slowly filling up with drippings from the sponge.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to vincent)}
<D>__{take the clamp...}
<A>__{vincent picks up the clamp.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{peel back the skin and attach the clamp.}
<A>__{vincent attaches the clamp to sam's wound. it takes perhaps fifteen seconds, and everyone of those seconds is agonizing for sam. he sweats, he grits his teeth, he grunts the smallest of grunts. but he doesn't move. finally vincent is done.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{alright, it's done.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you see the bullet?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{clearly.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{good. now take the forceps, and remember, vincent, what we're doing here is routine. i've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field. there are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries you can't kill me. just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.}
<A>__{vincent probes the wound with the forceps. this takes probably thirty seconds, and it hurts even more then when the clamp was attached. several times vincent seems to have the bullet in his grasp, but it slips, and each time it slips sam makes the smallest of noises, as if to indicate the level of the pain. finally the forceps firmly grasp the bullet, and with a single tug, vincent extracts it.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(holding the bullet aloft)}
<D>__{a souvenir...}
<A>__{he tosses the bullet through the air, and we follow it in slow motion as it lands in a saucer, which sits on the kitchen counter. we're back in real time, as the bullet rolls around the plate for a second before coming to a halt. now sam breathes the hugest of sighs, and his face relaxes. instantly, vincent puts a lighted cigarette in sam's mouth, and he drags deeply on it.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to vincent)}
<D>__{you think you can stitch me up on you own? jean pierre don't worry, we'll take care of it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{then if you don't mind...}
<P>__{(he hands the cigarette back to vincent)}
<D>__{i'm gonna pass out.}
<A>__{and that's exactly what he does.}
