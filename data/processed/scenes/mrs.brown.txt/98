<L>__{exterior balmoral castle day}
<A>__{disraeli hurries through the pouring rain.}
<C>__{disraeli }
<D>__{... no prime minister made greater sacrifice than attempting to run the country six hundred miles north of civilization.}
<A>__{reaching the castle, he hurries inside and the great doors bang behind him.}
<L>__{interior balmoral castle, queen's drawing room day}
<A>__{the next day. queen victoria is playing the piano like she walks, with great vim and vigor. the tune is some quaint scottish ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice, almost drowning out prince arthur, prince louise and prince leopold who are meant to be accompanying her. they stand in a nervous semi circle, fumbling their harmonies. ignoring them completely, victoria bobs up her head with a quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated. disraeli and the rest of the household stand a few yards off, smiling rigidly. disraeli, the consummate politician to his inch high insteps, out smiles the lot of them. this man is in raptures of delight. and the more liquid his smiles, the happier he makes victoria. he beams, she belts, until her children are drowned out completely. and then, with characteristic suddenness, victoria stops playing and launches into one of her tirades. the household wobbles in shock like children on a switch back, but disraeli glides smoothly from delight to sober concern.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{how dare the irish break with the anglicans? if albert were alive today he would never allow the crown to give up church patronage. no, the irish must be told, very firmly, to stay exactly where they are. it is the thin edge of the wedge, mr disraeli. next, you will be telling me that the crown no longer governs this nation.}
<A>__{a beat. a nervous silence in the household.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{your majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance. as for your people, look no further than the sales of your highland journals to see in what affection the nation holds their queen.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you sell even more copies than mr dickens.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{but i lack your prose, mr disraeli.}
<A>__{victoria gives him a tiny smile. disraeli acknowledges it, then steers the conversation back.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{of course i understand your concern. you miss your people.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{and they miss you.}
<A>__{victoria registers a slight flicker of defensiveness at the implied criticism.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{then they may read about me.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{is that not enough?}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{in so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave. a figurehead.}
<A>__{victoria has the measure of him.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{i never thought to be bullied by you, mr disraeli. you, i thought, understood a widow's grief.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{forgive me, ma'am, i cannot speak for the nation, only for myself. as prime minister i confess i miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and i should not burden you with it.}
<A>__{the household waits. has he clawed himself back? victoria acknowledges his apology. her voice drops and she talks directly to disraeli, straight from the heart.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{i stay here because i am happy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{is that such a terrible crime?}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{no, ma'am.}
<A>__{at this moment the far door opens and brown walks in.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{time for your walk.}
<A>__{without a word, victoria rises from her chair and starts following him out. as they pass disraeli, she stops.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{this is my good john brown.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<P>__{(taking him in)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{i have asked him to show you a little of highland life while you are with us at balmoral.}
<A>__{brown measures disraeli suspiciously.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{what brings you here?}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{a man can refuse only so many invitations from his queen. it was remiss of me not to come earlier.}
<A>__{victoria smiles. brown stares.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{what do you know about the highlands?}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{i am a blank sheet.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{do you hunt?}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{occasionally.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{dare say you can be taught.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{to shoot perhaps, but not to kill.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{if you hunt, you kill.}
<A>__{disraeli counters effortlessly.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{well then, i will do my best.}
