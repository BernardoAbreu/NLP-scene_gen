<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{i don't. i just know they were there when i left. i'm giving you helpful information is all. you know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.}

<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{why are you lecturing me?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{this isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake. i think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences. you're very young, tracy underage, in fact but maybe one day you'll understand.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{i don't know what you're referring to, but i do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i agree. but i also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{and i think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant. and they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. and if you want to keep questioning me like this, i won't continue without my attorney present.}
