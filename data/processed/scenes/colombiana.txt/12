<L>__{interior chimney day}
<A>__{cat, holding her breath, listening keenly to the sound of the men departing, is wedged into the chimney, her hands and feet clinging like a lizard to the walls on either side.}
<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{cat comes over the top of a hill, the soot of the chimney, mingled with the blood of her parents, staining her dress. the doors and windows all along the street are shuttered tight. her eyes search the curb as she makes her way down the street. when she hears the sound of a vehicle. she looks up to a jeep turning the corner.}
<B>__{reverse on marco}
<A>__{in the windshield of the jeep, staring at her.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{we got her! close the net!}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she sees marco. she pauses for a moment, and then does something that stuns even marco. she starts to run right towards the jeep!}
<B>__{on marco}
<A>__{a bit stunned.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{what is she doing?}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{she keeps sprinting toward the jeep. another jeep appears over the hill behind her. starts to come at her.}
<B>__{on marco}
<A>__{as his jeep speeds right for her.}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{as she runs, her eyes go to the right, and it becomes apparent she knows exactly what she is doing. she has a plan. and she executes it. suddenly, she leaps for the curb and...}
<B>__{a sewer grate. on marco}
<A>__{sees cat dive to the curb.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{no!}
<B>__{on cat}
<A>__{as she wriggles her skinny little body down the grate, with barely enough room to squeeze in. but in she does squeeze.}
<B>__{on marco}
<A>__{in total disbelief, watching her disappear down the narrow slit in the curb. both jeeps pull up. the men jump out. marco flattens to the street, peers into the grate, sees cat staring up at him. marco takes his gun out. jams it in the grate... bambambambambam!!!! empties his clip into the dark. when he runs out of ammo, he peers down again. cat is gone. the gunmen run to the next sewer grate fire into that one. marco looks down, no cat.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{get down there!}
<A>__{the gunmen rip the grate out, jump down the hole.}
