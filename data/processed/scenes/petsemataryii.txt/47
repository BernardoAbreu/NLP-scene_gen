<L>__{exterior rabbit cages night}
<A>__{zowie swings his head in the direction of the house as gus bursts through the back door. drew is one step behind. gus swings the gun up and fires off a shot. zowie bolts for the shadows of the hillside. drew rushes in and deflects the aim of the rifle.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{don't shoot him!}
<A>__{gus' eyes are wild with anger.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{what, drew? what did you say?!}
<A>__{gus throws drew aside, brings the rifle back up and fires another random shot after the fleeing dog. all the while, his eyes remain on drew, as if this were the boy's lesson to be learned. he squeezes off one more shot... a pained yelp echoes from the hillside. zowie's yelp. drew whips his head aside in sickened shock. even gus is sobered by the unexpected hit. all they can hear now are zowie's whimpering cries diminishing in the night. drew shoots gus a look of such unbridled hatred that gus is speechless. he backs away from gus and darts off toward the dark hillside. when gus turns back for the house, amanda is standing there.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{jesus, gus, what have you done?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{ah, come on, amanda, stop looking at me like that. he's had ample warning about that dog.}
<A>__{amanda glares at him, an outpouring of pent up strain. gus defiantly marches past amanda, entering the house without ever meeting eyes with her.}
