<A>__{he walks from the parked car toward the pool, returning bill's salutation.}
<L>__{exterior area around pool}
<A>__{shooting from behind the shooter as he approaches the attractive family group that includes, besides bill and the baby, a five year old girl who is having her hair brushed after swimming by rosanna schlaegel, her beautiful mother. a family dog completes the picture. bill continues to feed the baby as he hails the shooter.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{shooter very generous of you to come on such short notice. rosanna you know, and i think you've met my daughter june.}
<P>__{(indicating baby)}
<D>__{no point introducing you to william the fourth. he has a bad memory for names.}
<C>__{shooter}
<P>__{(greeting them in turn)}
<D>__{mrs. schlaegel. how are you, june. what's it all about, bill?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{little something i'd like to sound you out on. but the least i can do is offer you a drink.}
<C>__{rosanna}
<D>__{like me to fix it, love?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{wonderful. why don't you do a batch of your bloody marys? if that's okay with you, shooter?}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{great. whatever.}
<A>__{as she goes off, rosanna cautions june about her hair.}
<C>__{rosanna}
<D>__{just don't let it get wet again.}
<A>__{as soon as his wife is gone, bill goes right to the topic he doesn't want to discuss in her presence.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i've been quite busy on the telephone since i last saw you. there's a lot of interest all over the country in this game with lancey and the kid.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{betting interest?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{jack doyle in new york is giving twelve to five on lancey. same odds in reno. i've taken fifty thousand of it so far.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{fifty thousand!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i will probably go for more but i didn't want to rock the odds.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{i knew you liked the kid's style but why you going in so deep?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{two reasons. first, i want to see that smug old bastard gutted worse than he gutted me. second, as long as that's going to happen, i don't see why i shouldn't make some money out of it.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{but how can you be so sure? the kid could do it, we both know that, but }
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{"could" isn't good enough for a man who hates to lose money as much as i do. he's going to need help from the best man with a pack of cards between omaha and new orleans.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{not a chance, bill. you ought to know i never ever use what i got with the cards for nothing but tricks and dressing up a game.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{sure, i know it. that's why you're the man they choose to give them a square deal. that's what makes it so perfect. nobody'll be looking for it.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{it's out. out.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the great thing is they'll be so close, the kid won't need much. three or four key hands.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{understand this, bill. i'd like for the kid to win, and i sure as hell don't want to see you lose all that money }
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{if i did, i'd have to collect that twelve grand you owe me. not myself. my collection agents. you knew poor wildwood jones, didn't you?}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{ok but i'm paying it off! it's comin' in ain't it? six grand already.}
<P>__{(then as bill just looks at him)}
<D>__{bill, you got to listen to me !}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no, i don't. it's quite the other way around. you have some delusion you're a free agent, but you're not. i own you.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{for god's sake !}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{shut up. i will cross the twelve off the books and give you ten thousand dollars in cash. and you can tell the kid if he needs more of a stake, i will put it up.}
<P>__{(looks o.s. and smiles)}
<D>__{marvelous. here's rosanna with what you need.}
<A>__{camera moves to include rosanna carrying a tray with glasses and a pitcher full of bloody marys.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{ for that dry feeling on the roof of your mouth.}
<P>__{(time lapse)}
