<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{a white title appears on a black screen. "as night fall does not come at once, neither does oppression...it is in such twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become victims of the darkness."}
<D>__{justice william o. douglas}
<A>__{the title fades off, replaced by a second title. "i not only think that we will tamper with mother nature, i think mother wants us to."}
<D>__{william gaylin}
<A>__{the second title fades off, leaving a dark screen. the darkness gradually gives way to a dawning light. we are confronted with sight of a barren, empty landscape. a wide expanse of wasteland. suddenly, without warning, an elephant tusk falls from the sky and crashes onto the parched ground. the earth shuddering impact causes the tusk to rebound once in slow motion before finally settling to the desert floor in a cloud of dust. the first tusk is quickly followed by a second, also dropping from the heavens. it lands near the first. another tusk smashes to earth several yards away. yet another comes crashing into the foreground. finally the dust settles upon a graveyard of tusks.}
