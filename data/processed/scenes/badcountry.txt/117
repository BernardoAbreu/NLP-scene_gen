<L>__{interior fbi warehouse late night}
<A>__{televisions broadcast news coverage of the shoot out. agents work, uncomfortable, as bud and fitch argue. explosive...}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{keep your voice down! this was out of my control!}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i'm telling you, your agents best pull their shit together! who the hell y'all trying to protect?!}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{look, carter. this is a joint task force with multiple agendas, that run up the chain of command through me. intel came forth at the eleventh hour that naseem kazuri an international arms dealer would be present at this meet. atf was tasked to observe and report.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{that ain't what they did !}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{ no! because your informant }
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{my informant, that's right! }
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{ your informant and his psychopath crew greased half our political interests over a bag of fake cash! you weren't informed, so what?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{well i better be informed! 'cause this ain't fallin' short! now, any of y'all got a collaborative agenda in the works? i want to see it. these other agencies, what time lines they lookin' at? what deadlines and why?}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{above your pay grade }
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{and is there a purposeful lack of communication between competing agencies, who are right now charting future mistakes, as we fuckin' speak?!}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{that's not your concern, carter!}
<A>__{braddock suddenly arrives, steps into the room...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{we're not talkin' about me!!}
<C>__{braddock}
<D>__{bud!}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(spins)}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{braddock}
<D>__{you're over involved here.}
<A>__{and bud's taken off stride. braddock looks bud right in the eyes, so there's no doubt...}
<C>__{braddock}
<D>__{i will handle this.}
<A>__{bud, red with anger, walks out. braddock watches him go. fitch comes over, relieved...}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{thanks for coming down, mike. he's been berating my agents for the last hour.}
<A>__{braddock pours a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{we're trying to band aid a situation here, and frankly, carter's preference for thug tactics isn't helping. it'll all be in my report...}
<C>__{braddock}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{"isn't helping?"}
<A>__{a big mistake. now braddock turns on fitch, zeroing in...}
<C>__{braddock}
<D>__{"isn't helping?" let's not miss what happened here, fitch. we work for the same cause doesn't mean we work for you. what are you gonna do now? send jesse back out? earn his trust? bud carter delivered the biggest informant in the history of this state to your lap, and you and the people you work for are gonna let it go to shit.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you can expect that will be in my report.}
