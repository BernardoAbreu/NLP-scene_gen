<L>__{interior bedroom apartment day}
<A>__{the sweet silence of slumber. suddenly, an alarm clock on a nightstand shrieks the operatic tones of maria callas. a well manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze button and mutes maria. a few seconds reprieve. then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the fortissimo pounding of the "william tell overture." toes, also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser. letty mayer, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music. she opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are arranged by color, from white to beige to black. behind the panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. letty pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties. letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen suit. she lays it on the bed. beast, her cat, jumps on the bed and settles into the jacket. letty swoops the animal off her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{listen, beast. what have i told you about linen?}
<A>__{the scolding is cut short by an "urge overkill" song that screams out from another room. on cue, letty heads down the hall, dressing as she goes. she clucks for beast to follow.}
<L>__{interior kitchen same}
<A>__{letty turns off the alarm clock that blasts "urge overkill" from the counter and checks the time against her watch. she swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food arranged by type. seafood on the left, chicken in the middle, then, naturally, beef. letty reaches for a can.}
<C>__{letty}
<P>__{(looking at beast)}
<D>__{it's liver saute.}
<A>__{letty considers the cat a moment, and chooses another can.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{fine, then, chicken in gravy. but you're going to have to eat the liver tomorrow.}
<L>__{interior bathroom same}
<A>__{letty puts the finishing touches on her make up and pulls back her hair, plastering an errant curl into place with hair spray. yet another alarm clock sounds, this time blaring the voice of shock jocks mark and brian.}
<L>__{interior entry hall same}
<A>__{letty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock, which is mounted near the front door. she bends down to kiss the cat good bye, grabs a briefcase and leaves.}
<L>__{exterior hallway chasen elementary school day}
<A>__{a school bell buzzes. grade schoolers, clutching lunch pails, scurry past letty, who stands outside an office door. she straightens her jacket, takes a deep breath and starts to turn the handle. letty is stopped cold when chandra, 7, the victim of a bloody nose, runs up to her, bawling.}
<C>__{chandra}
<D>__{miss mayer. miss mayer.}
<A>__{letty looks quickly at chandra, her watch, the door.}
<C>__{letty}
<P>__{(to chandra)}
<D>__{goodness, this is a bad one. tip your head back.}
<A>__{she bends down and pushes back chandra's head. chandra, off balance, places one very bloody hand on letty's jacket lapel, staining it for all eternity. letty, grimacing, takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and guides chandra down the hall, coaxing the child as she goes.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{come on. pinch it, chandra. pinch it.}
<L>__{interior principal's office chasen elementary school later}
<A>__{principal gail lauer, 40s, sits in uncomfortable silence with bill johansen, the 50 something school superintendent. also present are mrs. montes, who is a school board member, and two other board members. principal gail glances at the clock. mrs. montes taps her foot. johansen clears his throat.}
<C>__{johansen}
<D>__{well, i have a full calendar today, and i'm afraid...}
<A>__{the door bursts open. letty stumbles into the room. she clutches her briefcase to her chest, trying to cover her blood smeared lapel.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{mr. johansen, hello. i'm so sorry i'm late. it's very nice to meet you.}
<A>__{letty continues to hug the briefcase while awkwardly bending down to shake hands with johansen and the others.}
<C>__{principal gail}
<D>__{the superintendent was just getting ready to leave.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i do apologize. a student had a crisis.}
<C>__{mrs. montes}
<D>__{a crisis, you say?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{a bloody nose...}
<A>__{there is no response. letty reluctantly lowers the briefcase and reveals the stain.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{a bloody nose of epic proportions.}
<A>__{johansen smiles.}
<C>__{johansen}
<D>__{ok. miss mayer. ten minutes. wow us.}
<L>__{exterior playground chasen elementary school later}
<A>__{a bunch of boys play kickball in a haze of sawdust. chandra sits on a bench, clamping an ice pack to her nose. jenny, a limber 8 year old, hangs upside down from the jungle gym. letty talks on her cell phone. she glances around to monitor her wards, eyes darting like a hawk's toward the kickball game.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{no cherry drops, jenny.}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{yes, hi. i'm calling for paul lascher.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{could you tell him it's letty?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he can't? um, well, tell him, tell him that they went for my math idea. thanks.}
<A>__{letty dials again. she sees two boys fighting over the ball and moves in to break them up.}
<C>__{letty}
<P>__{(to boys)}
<D>__{not so rough, guys.}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{mom? hi. you'll never guess what...i've got the best news.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no, about work. how about dinner?}
<A>__{brawl averted, out of the corner of her eye, letty catches jenny make the daring cherry drop back flip off the bar. she blows a series of angry, staccato notes on her whistle.}
<C>__{letty}
<P>__{(to jenny)}
<D>__{you're in trouble, young lady.}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{i know, mom. but it's the only place i can call from.}

<C>__{letty}
<D>__{got to go, mom. the monsters call.}
<L>__{interior restaurant night}
<A>__{tuxedoed waiters glide through the tony restaurant, where the patrons dare speak only in hushed tones. letty sits sipping wine with her mother, mrs. martha mayer, immaculate in a cream suit, young looking for her 50 odd years. letty's sister ruth early 20s and pretty, with flyaway hair and an ever present smile bounds into the restaurant, oozing happiness. letty discretely waves her over.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{sorry i'm late.}
<A>__{letty pours her a glass of wine.}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<D>__{letty was just getting ready to tell me her good news.}

<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<P>__{(leaning toward letty)}
<D>__{letty, dear, is that a cat hair on your blouse?}
<A>__{letty removes the nasty hair from her blouse.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{so, i got the district to approve my after school math program.}
<A>__{ruth smiles at her, but vacantly.}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<D>__{how wonderful, darling.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what does that mean for you?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i will be running it three days a week, and...}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<D>__{will you get time off to do that?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.}
<A>__{ruth stares around the restaurant, a shit eating grin plastered across her face.}
<C>__{letty}
<P>__{(to ruth)}
<D>__{what's up with you?}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{me? nothing. tell me more about the job.}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<P>__{(to ruth)}
<D>__{not a job, a promotion.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{no, mom, it's more of a prestige thing.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{mmmmmmm.}
<A>__{letty passes her hand in front of ruth's eyes.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{ruth. calling ruth.}

<C>__{letty}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{no, really. tell me about the promotion.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...}
<A>__{ruth can't hold it a moment longer without bursting.}
<C>__{ruth}
<P>__{(almost screaming)}
<D>__{i'm getting married.}
<A>__{mrs. mayer's eyes immediately fill with tears. ruth leaps up and hugs her mother. other diners glance toward the table. one woman in the restaurant taps the side of her glass with her fork and raises a silent toast to ruth. other diners follow suit. ruth grins back and starts to giggle.}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<D>__{i'm so happy for you. it's just wonderful.}
<A>__{mrs. mayer dabs her eyes with her napkin.}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<D>__{my goodness. a wedding. my goodness.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{wow. congratulations.}
<A>__{ruth dashes around the table to embrace the stunned letty.}
<C>__{ruth}
<P>__{(to letty)}
<D>__{can you believe it?}
<A>__{ruth sits back down and pulls a gorgeous ring from her purse. she slips it on and wiggles her finger in front of letty and her mother, who peers at it with approval.}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<D>__{tell us every detail.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{you've only known jake a few months.}

<L>__{interior bedroom letty's apartment night}
<A>__{letty's in bed, drawing a giant multiplication chart. paul lascher, early 30s, handsome in a corporate way, shrugs off his expensive suit. he opens a drawer of letty's dresser, and removes a neatly pressed t shirt. he smooths out another shirt he has accidently rumpled in the process.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so, another one bites the dust.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{it's not another one. it's my sister.}

<C>__{letty}
<D>__{believe me, i know your feelings on the matter.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the receptionist said you called earlier about something.}
<A>__{letty holds up her multiplication chart and shows it to paul.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{my math program. the superintendent said he'd fund it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{good going. i knew you could do it.}

<D>__{my dog ate my turtle, and the shell went crunch. i brought it for show and tell.}
<A>__{the children perk up at this news.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i'm sorry about your turtle bobby, but you know we only have show and tell on mondays. today, we're scheduled for grammar.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{but my mom says i have to throw it away tonight.}

<D>__{don't even think about it.}
<A>__{she grabs the bag. from outside, there is a knock. letty and the students look toward the window. it's ruth. she's been crying. she waves to letty. chandra waves back at ruth. letty puts up her finger to signal "just a minute" to ruth. she sets the turtle bag on bobby's desk.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{class, why don't you...}

<D>__{come on up, zach.}
<A>__{zach approaches the board and begins to write, "i am..." he doesn't get any further before letty cuts him off.}

<D>__{neater, zach.}
<A>__{zach begins again, but letty stops him when he reaches "am."}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{zach, you know the line by the "a" has to come straight down or it looks like an "o."}
<A>__{zach looks back toward his classmates for help.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{what's wrong, zach?}
<A>__{letty picks up a piece of chalk and writes an "a." she erases it furiously and works at it until the "a" is perfect.}
<C>__{l}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{try again, zach. like that.}
<A>__{letty jabs at the board with a piece of chalk. zach freezes. he sees letty's shoes, her arm, her contorted face, and, above all else, that perfect "a" staring right back down at him. letty grips zach's arm, guiding the chalk to form what looks like a pretty good "a."}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i don't believe it. you still can't do it.}
<C>__{zach}
<D>__{i'm sorry, ok. miss mayer?}

<C>__{letty}
<D>__{it has to be good, zach. do you understand me?}
<A>__{zach wrests free of letty. he's in full cry now. he backs away, stumbles, then makes a run for his seat. bobby snickers at zach's misfortune. other children glance around, unsure, confused. letty looks vacantly at the children, stares at the board and looks at the children again. she sits down at her desk and buries her face in her hands. letty's fists, clenched at first, slowly relax. she takes a deep breath and raises her head.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i'm very, very sorry, zach.}
<A>__{zach continues to cry. letty looks down at her desk. she grabs a piece of construction paper and a jar of paste.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{you know what, guys? wednesday's not a grammar day. it's a collage day. it's a collage on the wall day.}
<A>__{letty jumps up. she slaps the paper on the wall with some paste. she motions for the students to join her. the children slowly approach her. zach lags behind.}

<D>__{it's just i've got those parent conferences, and i'm supposed to set up the math program by next week.}

<C>__{letty}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{of course it will. remember the big talent show you planned last year? and what about the christmas benefit when santa canceled at the last minute? but you still pulled it off.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{yeah.}

<D>__{you just need to get more organized. l}

<C>__{letty}
<D>__{well...}
