<A>__{a box of mothballs that roll across the floor. okra has to step over boxes of toilet paper.}
<C>__{okra}
<D>__{why did you buy so much toilet paper?}
<C>__{m.c.}
<D>__{i got that on the job when i was a janitor. they didn't pay me.}
<A>__{harry picks up an old cigar box that falls opens. dice, shotgun shells, some spent .38 slugs and an old rusty knife, a crab apple switch, land on the floor. harry picks up the knife.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{whose old piece of knife is this?}
<C>__{herman}
<D>__{that was my brother's knife.}
<A>__{harry gives the knife to babe brother and signals him to put it in his pocket. the sound of the thunder has an unreal violence to it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. come with us, boy. we are going to have a good time.}
<C>__{babe brother}
<D>__{this would be a bad time for me to leave.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{we are going where the action is. ain't that right, okra?}
<P>__{(then back to babe brother)}
<D>__{let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up.}
<P>__{(beat)}

<D>__{had moms and pops given me my share of what was mine, i could have been rich by now. linda and i had it all worked out.}
<A>__{harry wins the first hand.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i know your mind is on your wife but you should never treat a woman as an equal. you want to get your wife back, get another woman, one of those big hip women that will ride you till you sweat.}
<A>__{harry wins another hand. m.c. and okra are still packing while herman is eating argo starch.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{double the stakes?}
<A>__{babe brother agrees but his thoughts are obviously somewhere else. harry studies his hand and looks at babe brother; he puts down his hand. babe brother wins and is quite pleased. the next series of hands are won by babe brother.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{m.c., you ever heard of a real man having one woman?}
<C>__{m.c.}
<D>__{no, lord!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{when one woman puts you out, you have another to take you in. you don't drive around without a spare tire, do you? the more mules you have hitched, the easier it is to plough.}
<A>__{harry loses another hand and babe brother suddenly has a pile of money.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{herman, let me borrow a few bucks.}
<A>__{herman stand over him with a roll of bills and peels off several.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{bless you. bless you.}
<A>__{herman is standing behind babe brother, singing to himself.}
<C>__{herman}
<D>__{in the ground there is a hole and green grass growing around the hole. now in the hole there is tree and green grass growing all around the tree. now there is a hole in the ground, a tree in the hole and green grass growing around the hole.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{let me share something with you.}
<A>__{harry stops and thinks for a while.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{hattie is a snake. that woman broke up so many homes and caused a lot of misery and because she calls herself getting religion everything is put right.}
<A>__{okra is taking several shotguns out of the closet.}
<C>__{okra}
<D>__{these damn things are unloaded, ain't they?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's important to know the difference between the incoming fire and the outgoing fire. as amos and andy might say, "we is the outgoing fire." come with us, son. we'll show you some steaming hot juke joints, steaming hot women.}
<C>__{m.c.}
<D>__{a pot full of chitlins and a good time.}
<C>__{babe brother}
<D>__{let me go by the house first.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{we will wait for you as long as we can. i got to get my things from your mother's house.}
<A>__{babe brother hurries out. m.c., herman and okra flop down in chairs and on the bed and look at their watches. harry sits at the table tapping out a rhythm on the table and whistling very softly to himself. suddenly harry sees that babe brother left the pile of money on the table. a look of concern comes over his face.}
