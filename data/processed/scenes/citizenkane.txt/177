<L>__{interior leland's office chicago enquirer night }
<A>__{leland, as in the same scene in the bernstein sequence, is sprawled across his typewriter, his head on the keys. the paper is gone from the roller. leland stirs and looks up drunkenly, his eyes encountering bernstein, who stands beside him (also as in the previous scene).}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{hello, mr. leland.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{hello, bernstein.}
<A>__{leland makes a terrific effort to pull himself together. he straightens and reaches for the keys then sees the paper is gone from the machine.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{where is it where's my notice? i've got to finish it!}
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{mr. kane is finishing it.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{kane? charlie?}
<P>__{(painfully, he rises to his feet)}
<D>__{where is he?}
<A>__{during all this, the sound of a typewriter has been heard off a busy typewriter. leland's eyes follow the sound. slowly he registers kane in the city room beyond. this is almost the same shot as in the previous bernstein story.}
