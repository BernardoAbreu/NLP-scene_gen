<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior tavern night}
<A>__{moments later. porthos regales the barmaids with a tale.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i said, 'a queen is no different than a barmaid in the dark. though less... practiced in the arts of pleasure...'}
<A>__{the barmaids accept his leering compliment with glee. but d'artagnan isn't so sure. porthos, with two barmaids, bellows a reply.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{if you're going to be a proper musketeer, you'll have to learn the manly art of wenching. right, ladies?}
<A>__{the barmaids heartily concur. d'artagnan looks over porthos' shoulder, to the dark haired barmaid seen previously. porthos follows his gaze, grins.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{ahh, very good. your first subject. but you'll need instruction. watch closely.}
<A>__{porthos pulls one of the barmaids to his chest, brings her lips toward his.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{the secret to wenching is the first kiss. for in that kiss, a lasting impression is made. if it is weak, she will think you are weak. and if it is comical, she will think you are a clown. with me?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{weak... weak. comical... clown.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{very good. and as a musketeer is never weak, and only rarely a clown, your first kiss must be all the things that you are. like this...}
<A>__{porthos gives the barmaid a powerful kiss. he breaks it, turns to d'artagnan with a grin.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{you may speak first if you like, your name, her name, an endearment or two. but words are usually a waste of time.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{only if you don't know which words to say.}
<A>__{all turn to regard aramis. he'll play along too. porthos reacts with delight. d'artagnan with interest. aramis continues:}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{words may make a more lasting impression than a thousand of porthos' kisses.}
<C>__{barmaid}
<P>__{(still reeling)}
<D>__{not likely.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i will demonstrate. please. sit beside me.}
<A>__{aramis' courtly behavior is as out of place in these environs as it is persuasive. the barmaid slips from porthos' lap, sits down on the bench beside him. aramis does not touch her. he simply looks into her eyes... and begins to speak.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{'shall i compare thee to a summer's day? thou art more lovely and more temperate: rough winds do shake the darling buds of may, and summer's leash hath all too short a date; sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, and often is his gold complexion dimmed; and every fair from fair sometimes declines, by chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed; but thy eternal summer shall not fade.}
<C>__{aramis }
<D>__{nor lose possession of that fair thou owest, nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade, when in eternal lines to time thou growest; so long as men can breathe, or eyes can see. so long lives this, and this gives life to thee.'}
<A>__{the barmaid, once skeptical, sits silently. her face covered with tears. aramis pauses, almost embarrassed by the outcome. he turns to d'artagnan, cites:}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{shakespeare.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{that's cheating.}
<A>__{the barmaid on his lap disagrees.}
<C>__{barmaid}
<D>__{it's beautiful.}
<A>__{d'artagnan looks at the dark haired barmaid across the room. porthos urges him on.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{come on, d'artagnan. we haven't got all night.}
<A>__{d'artagnan steps forward. the dark haired barmaid sees him coming and smiles. d'artagnan stands before her, hesitates, not sure where to start. then, remembering as best he can:}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{'shall i compare thee to a summer's day? thou are move lovely and more tempest, er, more tempered...'}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ahh, to hell with it }
<A>__{d'artagnan takes the barmaid into his arms, delivers a powerful kiss. as previously demonstrated. porthos and aramis smile proudly. the barmaids cheer.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{the boy's a natural.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{so little time, so much to learn.}
<A>__{d'artagnan drains his flagon, indicates athos sitting at a table by himself, scowling, working on his third bottle of burgundy.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{in all the years i've know him... i have never seen athos smile.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{why is he sitting by himself?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{athos takes his drinking seriously. ignore him. he'll be his usual warm, charming self by morning.}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{service! my lap is cold!}
<A>__{a barmaid scurries into view. porthos grabs her by the waist, adds the barmaid to the one already sitting on his lap. the chair breaks beneath them, and all three go sprawling on the floor, laughing heartily.}
<B>__{athos}
<A>__{he remains lost in drink. d'artagnan appears beside him. he hides his concern behind a cheerful attitude.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{come join us.}
<A>__{athos pulls d'artagnan down with a dark smile. he fills his flagon for him.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{you fight like a musketeer. let's see if you can drink like one.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i will drink anything you put in front of me.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{famous last words.}
<P>__{(raising his flagon)}
<D>__{what shall we drink to?}
<A>__{d'artagnan notices the dark haired barmaid eyeing him across the room.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{love?}
<A>__{the word nearly makes athos grimace. he stares at d'artagnan for a long beat, then beyond. as if to look into another time and place. finally:}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{love.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{would you like to hear a story, d'artagnan? a love story?}
<A>__{athos' voice reveals unexpected vulnerability, the pain he keeps inside. d'artagnan is fascinated, moved. he nearly whispers:}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{athos takes a long pull from the bottle of burgundy, wipes the blood red wine from his lips.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i once knew a man... one of the counts of berry. my native province. when the good count was about your age, he fell in love with a visitor from paris. a breathtaking girl of seventeen. she was more than beautiful, d'artagnan. she was... intoxicating. and this man, the poor idiot, he married her.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{isn't that what people do when they fall in love?}
<C>__{athos}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{be quiet and listen.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the count took her to his castle and made her the first lady of the province. they were happy for a time, as happy as a man and a woman can be. then one day, while riding in the woods, the girl was thrown from her horse, and knocked unconscious. the count hurried to help her. her dress was torn.}
<C>__{athos }
<D>__{on her her arm, the woman wore a gold band in the shape of a serpent. it was the only article of clothing she refused to remove. the count's curiosity got the best of him. he reached over and slid down the gold band. he saw something on her arm... something she'd kept hidden 'til then...}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{the fleur d'lis. she'd been branded...}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{d'artagnan reacts with shock.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{the count's angel turned out to be a murderess who escaped the executioner's blade. she swore that she loved him. swore that she had changed. and if he would just keep her secret, they would live a long life together.}
<A>__{athos pauses, imagines that life. the count and his angel.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{but the count was young and he was stupid. he was tormented by the ridicule of his social class. and so he rejected her. for her lies and for her past.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and turned her over to the authorities to be executed for the crime.}
<A>__{athos now turns his unflinching gaze on d'artagnan.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{but you see... his heart did not agree. the count soon realized what she had meant to him. and what he had done.}
<C>__{athos }
<D>__{that his... betrayal was far greater than her own.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{soon after he foreswore the society that shaped him. gave up his title. and was never seen again.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{he loved her.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{he killed her. it seemed like the same thing after a while.}
<A>__{hold on athos for a long time. as he gathers up his pain, and puts it back again. athos smashes open another bottle. but the story has made d'artagnan quite sober and a little sick to his stomach. he refuses another drink.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{good. more for me.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{aramis play something with some blood in it! i feel like dancing!}
<A>__{aramis launches into something appropriate. porthos and a barmaid get up and begin a festive folk dance. porthos is damned good. his joie de vivre is infectious and soon everyone in the inn is clapping and encouraging him. every once in awhile, another weapon a dagger or something drops out of porthos' clothing and hits the floor with a clatter. that's when porthos, dancing with abandon, spins out of control, trips and falls on athos' table, crushing it to the floor. porthos lies in the wreckage, staring up. athos, totally unperturbed, looks down and offers him the bottle.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{care to dance, athos?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{only if i can lead.}
<A>__{porthos blinks in amazement at athos' grim face, then breaks out laughing.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{aramis! athos made a joke!}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{the innkeeper comes down the stairs wearing a nightshirt and a sleepy expression.}
<C>__{innkeeper}
<D>__{excuse me, gentlemen.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{were we making too much noise?}
<C>__{innkeeper}
<D>__{you told me to wake you at dawn.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{innkeeper}
<D>__{it's dawn.}
<A>__{they turn in disbelief to the shuttered windows. sure enough. sunlight is peeking in through the cracks.}
