<L>__{exterior veranda day}
<A>__{the red light on marrow's digital voice recorder blinks. the device is in marrow's jacket pocket, concealed from nell. they're sitting in adirondack chairs on the long veranda behind the house. marrow, beside her, observes.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{what did it smell like?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{it was very specific.}
<C>__{marrow}
<P>__{(so tell me...)}
<D>__{all right...}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{in the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table. it smelled like that wood.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{so... smell... is... smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories. and a memory can trigger a smell.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{what happened after you smelled it?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i looked at theo. she had a look on her face.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{like she smelled it too?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{and then what happened?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i got more scared.}
<A>__{marrow thinks about this.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{hmm.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm messing up the study.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{no you're not. something moved you. you saw something.}
<A>__{nell looks to him. he's sincere. he believes her.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe i...}
<A>__{"didn't" she almost says. she struggles, embarrassed.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{i haven't been with people in a long time.}
<A>__{marrow settles in his chair, looks out at the forest.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{i really haven't either.}
<A>__{nell peers at him, doubtful. is she being made fun of?}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{i mean, i'm surrounded by people, day in, dayout. students, colleagues.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but most of the time, even when i'm with them... you know... it's all about power, there's not much room for actually getting to know someone or having someone getting to know you.}
<A>__{nell's face flushes with compassion. with longing. marrow looks at her. he's vulnerable. needing. she doesn't dare hope. the moment lasts a few heartbeats. he looks away. a flicker of distress crosses nell's face. and then she realizes marrow is looking at luke.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{you have to see something.}
