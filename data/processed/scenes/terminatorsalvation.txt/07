<A>__{close buckles tighten... an alcohol swab on marcus' forearm... a needle punctures his skin.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{what can i say. i was seventeen, i was angry, i was stupid.}
<A>__{fingers turn the valve to release the lethal chemicals. close on marcus' eyes, looking up toward the deadly i.v., running into his arm. from this, he looks toward his reflection in a one way mirror, the dim shapes of witnesses beyond.}
<D>__{marcus (v.o.) (cont'd) yeah... i'm sorry about it. i'm sorry about everything. the whole goddamn world...}
<A>__{as the lethal injection takes hold, his pov moves to bright lights overhead, losing focus and bleaching to white... from the white screen, a face emerges, backlit, blurred it's serena. she's in focus for just a moment, leaning into camera then moves out of frame.}
