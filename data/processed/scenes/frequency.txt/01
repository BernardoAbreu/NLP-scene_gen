<L>__{exterior manhattan bridge predawn 1969}
<A>__{darkness. headlights bounce off thick sheets of rain. 6,500 gallon esso oil truck barrels over wet studded pavement, heading towards manhattan. it's going fast. too fast. up ahead...at the base of the bridge: a large reflective sign lit up by arc lights: men at work. there are two work crews, several hundred feet apart. the first crew is con ed. a corrugated vacuum tube feeds into an open manhole. a worker drops into the hole. the second crew is construction. they're at the apron of the bridge securing lumber supports for the roadbed. it's late and the men are tired. a mistake is made. a fork lift loaded with lumber fails to negotiate a turn...whacks into an abutment... spilling its load onto the roadway. bad timing, because right now that esso oil truck hits the off ramp. not a lot of time for the driver to react to a roadway spewed with lumber. he does his best. slams the brakes, spins the wheel, hits the horn, but it doesn't matter: 18 wheels skid across the blacktop spitting thick smoke and burnt rubber, lifting off the slick pavement...twisting...flipping...hemorrhaging oil from its ruptured tanks...grinding its way towards... men at work. seconds to react as an 80,000 pound juggernaut of death plows through parked cars like paper...crushing the con ed equipment...lurching to a halt on top of the manhole.}
