<L>__{exterior kinograph studios day}
<D>__{she goes through the main gates of kinograph studios, and heads towards where they hire extras. in a courtyard, fifty odd people are waiting, some sitting on wooden crates, others standing. there are mums with kids, guys with animals, men dressed as cowboys, etc. peppy is among them, sitting next to a man of about sixty who is dressed in a highly stylized fashion. his job is obviously that of a butler. peppy proudly shows him the picture in the newspaper. the man leans to take a closer look, unfolds the newspaper, sees the headline, smiles and then folds it back up again and returns it to peppy text side up, highlighting the headline: who's that girl ? peppy is a bit annoyed to have been put in her place, but deep down she knows he's right. nobody knows who she is. she puts the newspaper away. a man who visibly works for the studio, some assistant or other, comes into the courtyard, climbs on a crate and makes an announcement. title card: contemporary film! five girls who can dance! all the men who had pressed forwards turn on their heels, leaving the assistant surrounded only by women. the man says something to one girl, who begins to dance. he motions to her that it's ok and she heads off towards the wardrobe section. he does the same with a second girl and she gets hired too. then it's peppy's turn. she puts a lot of energy into a few top class tap steps, impressing the guy to such an extent that he smiles admiringly then signals that she's hired. full of self assurance that her lucky day has come, peppy heads off towards wardrobe too; swinging, her hips as she pauses in front of the butler. title card: the name is miller. peppy miller! she finishes with an exaggerated wink, before walking on, leaving behind the impassive butler.}
