<A>__{willy, in his tux, comes out of a staircase and stops. rob nunally is waiting by willy's parked car.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{you're supposed to be good.}
<A>__{willy takes him in wary, seeing an edge of anger and fear beneath the tough controlled cop manner.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{is that what i'm supposed to be?}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{i asked around. you're supposed to be top notch but to me it looks like you've got one foot out the door, and you're wiping the rest of us off the bottom of the other one.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i'm sorry to...disappoint you.}
<A>__{nunally is silent frustrated. the concrete walls and ceilings echo from distant cars.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{i took crawford's confession.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{and now you want mine?}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{i'm here to warn you. take this seriously, because it's serious. this guy is stone cold and his wife is lying in a hospital bed with brain damage...}
<A>__{he struggles to keep himself under control.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{are you gonna be on this, or what?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{yeah. i'm on it.}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{you got a confession. you took the gun out of his hand. it's done.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{i'm just telling you. is that okay? or are you too friggin' busy?!}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{no. it's okay.}
<A>__{willy waits. watching the tortured cop wrestle with demons.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{forget it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's a lock. we're good. put him down. bury him.}
<A>__{willy nods. nunally turns and walks away, down a ramp. willy watches him go. sad. like he's watching nunally drown. but he's seen people drown before...and he's not about to put out a hand. might get pulled in himself.}
