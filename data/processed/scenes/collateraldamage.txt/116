<A>__{the suburban pulls up to the well guarded house gordy saw the night before. the men get out and go inside, leaving the suburban running, clearly planning to leave again right away.}
<B>__{gordy}
<A>__{carefully lowers himself to the ground. slides out on the side away from the house. hides behind a large wheel. the brightly lit house is surrounded by coconut trees. gordy watches the guards. when the guards aren't looking, he runs to the nearest tree. the sounds of the suburban's engine covers his footsteps.}
<B>__{trees}
<A>__{gordy moves from tree to tree when the guards aren't looking, when he reaches one tree, and...}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{thunk! a coconut hits the ground next to him, and... one of the guards comes to investigate. the guard gets closer. gordy inches around the tree. he can't get away without being seen. he nudges the coconut with his toe. nudges it harder, causing it slowly to roll away, and... the guard picks it up. never sees gordy in the shadow of the tree, pressed against the trunk. the guard shows the coconut to a guard near the house, then walks back.}
<B>__{gordy}
<A>__{sneaks to another tree. then reaches the house. he moves to a window. peers into a room. no one's there. but we hear the sound of voices. gordy creeps along the wall. looks into another room, and...}

<A>__{is a group of elc guerrillas, including the beaten man, packing suitcases, etc. leaving in a hurry.}
<B>__{gordy}

<A>__{he's found the wolf, when... suddenly, a guard appears, and... gordy freezes. eases into the shadows. his dirty face and clothes blend in just enough. the guard moves past.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{when the coast is clear, gordy moves to the large propane tank. he takes out the grenade. puts the rubber bands around it, spoon and all. grips the grenade in his hand, holding the spoon down, and yanks the pin. and then... slowly, slowly, gordy begins releasing his grip, allowing the rubber bands to take on the pressure of the spring loaded spoon. if they'll do it... if the spoon goes now, gordy's going up in the blast. gordy continues to relax his grip. the rubber bands stretch. stretch more. keep stretching until they're barely holding the spoon... but they're holding it. gordy quickly, carefully wires the grenade to the propane tank. then takes out the zippo, pulls it apart and removes the lighter fluid soaked cotton. holds the cotton just above the grenade and squeezes with his fingers. and... lighter fluid drops onto the rubber bands. gordy squeezes out as much as he can onto them. then gordy gets the hell out of there. he finds cover. ducks down. and waits. closeup grenade the lighter fluid is dissolving the rubber bands.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{gordy suddenly hears a woman's gentle singing. he looks in the direction of the sound, and... gordy sees the attractive woman and the boy approaching on the road. she's singing a gentle song in spanish. gordy's eyes flash with alarm. he glances at the house. closeup grenade the lighter fluid continues dissolving the rubber bands, which are now beginning to lose their elasticity and stretch from the pressure of the spoon.}
