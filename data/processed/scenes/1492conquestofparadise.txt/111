<L>__{exterior indian village day}
<A>__{moxica mounted on his magnificent black stallion canters to the edge of the deserted village and enters the village. utapan is terrorized by the absence of anything living. all we can hear is the breathing of the horse. the animal, an impressive mass of muscle, prances nervously. utapan calls out in dialect.}
<C>__{utapan}
<D>__{they here.}
<A>__{slowly, they begin to appear, one after the other materializing from the jungle. shy and scared. they stare at this "centaur" (the horse and the horseman seem to be one a god). to impress them even more, moxica makes the beast move sideways and backwards, rearing, its front hoofs pawing the air. the indians retreat in terror, except for one, who stands his ground, brandishing his lance. utapan encourages the young warrior to approach the centaur. he places his hand onto the shoulder of the animal. the muscles shudder. the indian jumps back comically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe. without warning, moxica climbs down from the saddle. more indians step back in fear and absolute astonishment. now more have ventured from the jungle. the bravest of them approach moxica, daring to touch him, and the horse, retreating then touching until they fill the compound. at this moment, columbus and his soldiers appear all around them, pointing their muskets, and their crossbows. a moment of tension. columbus walks forward, towards the chief (guarionex) we meet before.}
