<L>__{interior lestat's guest wing soon after}
<A>__{camera moves out into the lavish room toward the two girls who are now dreamy, floating with the effect of the joint they are smoking. reveal lestat as he approaches the girls. looking up, they smile childishly at their host, then fall about laughing.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i don't think we've met. groupie #1 oh my god... it's really you, isn't it? groupie #2 we want to be your slaves.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{of course you do.}
<A>__{he smiles. she offers a jointerior}
<D>__{groupie #1 want some?}
<A>__{lestat calmly shakes his head.}
<D>__{groupie #1 want me?}
<A>__{circling the couches, he just smiles.}
<D>__{groupie #1 you hungry?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i'm always hungry. groupie #1 we've got the munchies? you got any food?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{vampires don't eat... food.}
<A>__{the girls laugh nervously. lestat laughs dangerously...}
<D>__{groupie #1 you hungry for something else?}
<A>__{she opens her legs provocatively. pacing across the room, he stands before the girls. he curls his finger around the first groupie's hair when a shadow crosses his face.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{mine eyes dazzle, she died so young. groupie #1 huh?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{it's a very old poem of mine.}
<A>__{losing enthusiasm, lestat walks away and drops himself onto a couch. with a clap of his hands, the tv switches on. he silently watches one of his video clips. the girls glance at each other, then, giggling, crawl over toward lestat. groupie #1 slides her hand slowly up his leg.}
<D>__{groupie #1 c'mon, don't you want to have some fun?}
<A>__{she reaches for his belt. but he recoils at the touch and slides off the couch onto the floor with grace.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{don't do that. groupie #1}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{are you ticklish?}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{i'm very ticklish.}
<A>__{the second groupie giggles as well...}
<D>__{groupie #2 hey, you ever been tickled by four hands at once? hey, can you take both us, lestat? what'd'ya think?}
<A>__{and at once they both start after lestat on all fours to tickle him. he gazes at them, torn, then laughs at the sight and gets down on... all fours as well as he leads them around the room in a childish game.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i don't know. let's see.}
<A>__{they try to tickle him but he stays just a few feet ahead of them the whole time. the girls giggle as they pursue... lestat crawling just ahead of them across the floor and... up the wall. the teenagers keep giggling as they watch him ascend the wall like a spider. they can't believe what they're seeing as... lestat reaches the wall's top and now crawls upside down across the ceiling. the girls begin to giggle and half cry... as they arch their necks all the way back to see... lestat crawling down the opposite wall. the girls sit open mouthed with terror as lestat reaches the ground he heads straight for them. the girls begin to scream... screams continue over...}
