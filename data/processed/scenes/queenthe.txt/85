<A>__{tony sits up on his sofa in his office..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{good afternoon, your majesty. i'm sorry to disturb. i was just wondering..}
<A>__{nt. balmoral queen's study continuous prince philip indicates she should put tony on speaker phone. the queen obliges. tony's voice comes out..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{...whether you'd seen any of today's papers?}
<A>__{the queen looks at her desk. most of the newspapers are strewn out in front of her..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{we've managed to look at one or two, yes.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{in which case, my next question would be whether you felt some kind of response might be necessary?}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{no. i believe a few over eager editors are doing their best to sell newspapers..and it would be a mistake to dance to their tune.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{under normal circumstances i would agree, but..p}
<C>__{rince philip}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{here we go! the bloody flag again..!}
<A>__{elizabeth indicates for philip to be quiet..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{..my advisers have been taking the temperature among people on the streets and the information i'm getting is that the mood..}
<P>__{(choosing words carefully)}
<D>__{...is quite delicate.}
<C>__{prince philip}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{of course. that's where all the ruddy cameras are.}
<A>__{elizabeth gestures again for philip to `ssssshhh'..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{so what would you suggest, prime minister? some kind of statement?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{no, ma'am. i believe the moment for statements has passed.}
<A>__{tony takes a deep breath..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i would suggest flying the flag at half mast above buckingham palace...}
<A>__{prince philip almost has an apoplexy..}
<C>__{prince philip}
<D>__{see!}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{and coming down to london at the earliest opportunity.}
<A>__{philip stares in disbelief.."what?"}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{it would be a great comfort to your people and would help them with their grief.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{their grief?}
<A>__{he queen exchanges a look with philip..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{if you're suggesting that i drop everything and come down to london before i attend to two boys that have just lost their mother..you're mistaken.}
<C>__{rince philip}
<D>__{absurd.. e}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i doubt there are many who know the british more than i do, mr. blair, nor who has greater faith in their wisdom and judgement. and it is my belief that they will soon reject this `mood' which has been stirred up by the press...in favour of a period of restrained grief, and sober, private mourning.}
<P>__{a beat)}
<D>__{that's the way we do things in this country. quietly. with dignity.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{it's what the rest of the world has always admired us for.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{well, if that's your decision, ma'am, of course the government will support it.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{let's keep in touch.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{yes. could hardly be less}
<P>__{enthusiastic)}
<D>__{let's.}
<A>__{the queen hangs up. looks over at philip..}
<C>__{prince philip}
<D>__{bloody fool.}
<A>__{he indicates the tea..}
