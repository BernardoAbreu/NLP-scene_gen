<L>__{exterior lakeside, berlin day}
<A>__{steve lies, shirt off, taking the sun. children playing. noise behind him of someone in the bushes. steve doesn't move. rode, carrying a slender leather case, pushes through to steve, who remains with his eyes closed.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{major.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(eyes still closed)}
<D>__{helmuth.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{guess what i am holding in my hand. you like guessing games?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{love 'em, helmuth. i give up. what are you holding in your hand?}
<A>__{rode takes from the case a conductor's baton. steve opens one eye.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{it's dr. furtwangler's baton, which i stole.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{the one he kept in his right hand. yes, you remember.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{yes, you remember.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{how could i forget?}
<A>__{sits up, takes the baton. somewhere a child laughs; suddenly steve thrusts the baton at rode.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{show me.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{show you?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{yeah, show me, i want to see you do it. pretend i'm adolf. you're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{not here, major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, major...}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{do it, helmuth.}
<A>__{after nervous looks over his shoulder rode, salutes half heartedly.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{do it right.}
<A>__{rode thrusts his hand out in the nazi salute. people by the lake: mostly elderly, but some younger ones see rode saluting. some turn away. others stare.}
<C>__{steve's voice}
<D>__{you look great doing that.}
<A>__{rode and steve: rode looks around nervously, lowers his arm.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{and i see what you mean. you nearly poked my eyes out.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{exactly. replaces the baton, gives steve the case.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{don't worry, helmuth, it'll be our secret.}
<A>__{a ball comes bounding towards them. steve catches it. then a boy runs in, looks hopeful.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{mister, mister, here, here, mister!!!}
<A>__{steve tosses the ball back to him.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{great catch, kid. the boy runs off.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{so. you wanted to see me.}
<A>__{steve pats the spot next to him and rode sits.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{you usually don't work on sunday, major?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{all in the cause of humanity, helmuth. or should i call you one zero four nine three three one?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{one zero four nine three three one. or d'you mind if i just call you 'one'?}
<A>__{rode makes an attempt to go but steve grabs him.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you know what i say you are, helmuth? i say you're a piece of shit.}
<A>__{rode suddenly starts to retch.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{that bastard!}
<A>__{people by the lakeside: faces turning at rode's sobs. impassive. blank. steve and rode:}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{who's the bastard, helmuth? hinkel?}
<A>__{rode nods.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{why? he promised to remove your file?}
<A>__{rode vomits.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{and what about before that? what were you a member of in austria?}
<A>__{after a moment:}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{was a member of...? speak up?}
<C>__{rode}
<P>__{(barely audible)}
<D>__{i was a member of the communist party. i was a communist. that's what hinkel had over me. he knew everything. he held that over me. that's how he made me co operate.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{oh, i see, he made you co operate. and now are you a communist again?}
<C>__{rode}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{you don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that }
<P>__{(he stops.)}
<A>__{brief silence. steve stands. further along the lakeside: steve and rode walk. people about. boats on the lake.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{i would never, in my wildest dreams, have ever been a second violinist in the berlin philharmonic. when they got rid of the... the jews in the orchestra, it gave people like me a chance.}
