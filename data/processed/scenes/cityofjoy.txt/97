<L>__{exterior city of joy day}
<A>__{aloka comes toward us leading a group of lepers. and stops. her hand goes to her mouth. their pov clinic from distance two hundred normal people lined up outside the gaily be decked dispensary many mothers with small children in their arms. shanta sees aloka, gestures to indicate the incredible turn out. the normals at the end of the line turn to look at the approaching lepers.}
<C>__{leper woman}
<D>__{it is too beautiful to believe.}
<A>__{as if indeed she were right, their path is suddenly cut off by the goonda and a commando of thugs, armed with sticks and iron bars, backed up by a group carrying banners with slogans proclaiming in hindi, urdu, english: "we don't want lepers here!" there's a sudden uneasy silence. behind the thugs a short distance is the policeman who harassed max earlier and another cop. joan hurries forward.}
<C>__{goonda}
<D>__{good morning, sister to the poor.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{yes, mr. bhose?}
<C>__{goonda}
<D>__{those people aren't coming into this neighborhood.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{they are going to be treated at the dispensary. you have no right to stop them.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{hasari arrives with max, anouar, and meeta.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{go ahead, aloka, take them inside.}
<A>__{the goonda puts his hand on aloka. the policeman in the b.g. keep their distance.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{take your hands off her, you waster!}
<A>__{joan is seized by a sudden fury and grabs the goonda. he grabs her much harder. said growls and pushes forward. several thugs turn, step in to neutralize him. joan elbows the goonda and tires to westle free of him. as a reflex he raises his hand. and as he does, it's seized.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{max (with hasari in the b.g., confused, conficted). max slings the goonda against the side of a truck.}
<C>__{goonda}
<D>__{that was a mistake, doctor.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{the mistake's yours, putz.}
<P>__{(to aloka)}
<D>__{get these people inside.}
<A>__{aloka starts forward, leading the lepers. she's stopped by a sudden blow from the goonda's stick across her shoulders, knocking her to the ground, bleeding from the neck. hasari bolts for his wife, gets caught up in the melee. max swings around on the goonda and for the first time we realize how strong he is, and that he knows how to box. the goonda goes down and violence erupts. anouar is chopping at the legs of one of the thugs working on said. the massive said tears free and starts to beat the crap out of the two thugs holding him. the noise brings everyone out of the square, those lined up at the clinic, the children from the school. sunil comes flying out of the clinic. a stampede of those waiting outside the dispensary and those normally in the crowded alley ensues. shanta runs inside for help. shopkeepers barricade their shop windows. one of the thugs pours gasoline over anouar and lights a match. hasari kneels beside aloka when he sees the match ignite the tiny leper. without thinking, hasari hurls himself on top of anouar, rolling him in the dirt and against his own body to put out the flames. joan shouts, demanding the violence stop. she's hit from behind; she decides talk isn't going to do it. she grabs a piece of lumber and starts to fight.}
<B>__{angle on dispensary}
<A>__{an explosion in the doorway, scattering anyone who remains in the area of the dispensary doorway, badly wounding mehboub. more people with sticks. hasari goes down under several bodies. max reaches aloka, helps her up, sends her toward the clinic. he tears an attacker off of hasari and they fight back to back a moment. a second explosion near them... and through the smoke max sees...}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{ashoka astride his motorcycle, behind his dark glasses, with more thugs, these with molotov cocktails and pick axes, ready to raze the clinic and school and the surrounding neighborhood. sunil drags mehboub inside. people chant: "white monkeys, go home! white monkeys, go home! no lepers here! no lepers here!" the thugs cock their iron bars and bricks and molotov cocktails. max picks up an iron bar of his own and starts for ashoka. suddenly, there's a detonation followed by a blast of air so fierce, max is thrown to the ground. a bottle of gasoline has exploded just behind him. he's enveloped in smoke. an assailant bears down on joan with a cutlass. as the assailant is about to strike, hasari seizes the attacker and hurls him backward. ashish steps in and slashes the assailant with his own weapon, startling, even repelling hasari. from all over the lane, young fighters have come and joined the fray, not bothering to choose sides but merely enjoying the release. hasari lunges for a woman under attack by a boy, arriving too late to stop the boy from plunging his knife into the woman's belly. hasari fights his way to the woman, but she staggers into the mob. max knocks down one of the thugs only to have another hand grasp his shoulder. he turns, fist cocked to find poomina, her hands holding her face together. slowly, she takes hands away. the sides of her face have been laid open. max sweeps her up in his arms, heads for the clinic.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{oh, little girl, little girl...}
<A>__{joan is suddenly beside ashoka.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{we'll pay! all right then, so by all means, protect us!}
<A>__{ashoka raises a hand, the goonda blows a whistle, and the fighting stops as suddenly as it began. the com batants are breathing heavily. there is silence but for the groans and cries of the wounded and grieving.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{in a world such as ours, everyone needs protection. for the fee we discussed, from this day forward, i can assure you nothing like this will happen again.}
<A>__{a beat... saladdin is at joan's shoulder. ashoka points a finger at hasari.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{you. i warned you about the company you keep.}
<A>__{he revs his motorcycle and screeches away, leaving hasari staring after him in his dust.}
