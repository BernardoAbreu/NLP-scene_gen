<L>__{interior saab day}
<A>__{as the car makes its way back toward the freeway, jack looks over at miles and slows the car to a stop.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nothing. buckle up, okay?}
<A>__{miles obeys. without hesitation, jack accelerates and jumps the curb, heading into }
<L>__{exterior vacant lot continuous}
<A>__{the saab plows into a tree.}
<L>__{interior saab continuous}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what the fuck!}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(pointing at his face)}
<D>__{you said it looked like a car accident.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what the fuck!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will pay for it.}
<L>__{exterior vacant lot day}
<A>__{they get out to inspect the damage. the hood is slightly crumpled, and the front fender is bent.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{look at this!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know. doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{oh, no. oh, christ. no, you don't.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you need a new car anyway.}
<A>__{miles looks at his friend, incredulous.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i said i'd pay for it.}
<A>__{moments later the trunk is open, and the guys are unloading their cases of wine. miles notices that one box is dripping.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you broke some.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{whatever. sorry.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no, not whatever. you fucking derelict.}
<A>__{moments later miles looks on as jack hoists a foundation block toward the open driver's door of the saab.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you ready?}
<A>__{miles waves his hand in a gesture of "get it over with." grunting with effort, jack leans inside the car and drops the foundation block onto the gas pedal. direct hit! jack leaps backward and hits the dirt just in time. miles and jack watch the driverless saab race toward the tree, its speed increasing. but just before hitting it, the car drifts to one side and sails right past.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{oh, fuck!}
<A>__{the car zooms wildly across the vacant lot and, missing the tree, continues on until crashing through a fence and finally toppling headlong into a cement trench. only the back of the car remains visible. the whole thing is finished in a matter of seconds. still frozen in place, miles and jack turn slowly to each other.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's okay. i've got triple a.}
