<D>__{the only reason you're on tv right now is because rainbow randolph is a degenerate scumbag. i didn't discover you, i delivered you. like a bag of groceries. i have a bigger emotional investment in my nail polish. so don't peddle your sap to me, rhino. your job is just to smile and nod your head.}
