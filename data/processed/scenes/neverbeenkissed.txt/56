<L>__{interior classroom day}
<A>__{sam is perched on the desk. the usual players in their usual seats. aldys is standing and reading from her book.}
<T>__{aldys:}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players."}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{anyone have any idea what shakespeare meant by that?}
<A>__{no one answers.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{anyone? sera ... megan ... exchange student who doesn't speak english?}
<A>__{we cu on the students, ending on an asian boy who smiles wildly at sam and waves. sam smiles, and waves back.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's about disguise, playing a part. it's the theme of "as you like it." can anyone tell me where we see that?}
<C>__{aldys}
<D>__{well, rosalind disguises herself as a man and escapes into the forest.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{right. and it's when she's in costume that she can finally express her love for orlando. see, shakespeare's making the point here that when we're disguised, we feel freer. we can do things we wouldn't do in ordinary life.}
<A>__{cu on josie's face. she's clearly uncomfortable. sam walks up to a huge football player, brett.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{brett when you go out on the football field in your uniform, what happens?}
<C>__{brett}
<D>__{we win?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you hit people. you yell. you touch other guys' butts.}
<A>__{the class giggles. brett looks horrified.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{but it's okay, because you're in uniform. disguise changes the rules}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i had these spiderman pyjamas. i thought when i wore them, that i had super powers. one night i tried to walk up the side of the garage.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{did you make it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{to the emergency room. yeah.}
<A>__{josie smiles at this, a little smitten.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{josie, why don't you read from act 5, scene 2, rosalind's speech }
<A>__{josie stands up, starts reading }
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{"no sooner had they met but they looked; no sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but they sighed..."}
<A>__{josie's voice begins to fade away: }
