<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior street near docks night}
<A>__{one minute later. open close on a light shining into camera, then widen to reveal it is one of the door mounted spotlights on wiltey's patrol car. wiltey eases the car down the center of the street. sykes and jetson, guns ready, walk slowly along on either side of the car... eyes everywhere.}
<B>__{moving pov}
<A>__{as they move past the shadowy dock warehouses... watching for any signs of movement.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{sykes and jetson converse across the hood of the car as they walk. their eyes everywhere.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{i never thought i'd say this, but for once in my life i think i'm willing to wait for back up.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{we can't let him get away.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{why the hell are you so dead set against back up?}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(a difficult admission)}
<D>__{because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{but there's no more drug.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{you understand that. but how many others will?}
<A>__{sykes looks across at jetson's troubled expression. just then, wiltey spots a flit of movement cutting across his headlight beams fifty yards ahead. whatever it was, was large and fast. it darted into an open warehouse door.}
<C>__{wiltey}
<D>__{there he is!}
<A>__{and wiltey floors it. sykes and jetson watch, unable to stop him.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{wiltey!}
<A>__{he and sykes take off running. wiltey skids to the left, rockets in through the open warehouse door, out of sight. sykes and jetson pour it on. they hear a screech of brakes. they reach the warehouse door and race through.}
