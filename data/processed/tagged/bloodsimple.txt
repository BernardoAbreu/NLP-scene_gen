<D>__{i know a place you can get that framed.}
<A>__{the voice is familiar as that of the narrator whose musings on life in texas and the soviet union opened the movie. we cut to him. he is settling himself into a chair facing the desk. he is loren visser, a large unshaven man in a misshapen yellow leisure suit. he smiles at the man behind the desk.}

<C>__{marty}
<D>__{how long did you watch her?}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{most of the night...}
<A>__{he lights his cigarette, then slaps his lighter onto the desktop. it is silver, engraved on the top with a lariat spelling out "loren" in script, and on the side with a declaration that he is "elks man of the year."}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...they'd just rest a few minutes and then get started again. quite something.}

<A>__{a smoke ring floats into frame from offscreen.}
<C>__{visser}

<C>__{marty}
<D>__{no. it just made them feel better.}
<A>__{marty rises and goes to a safe behind his desk. visser laughs as he watches marty.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{well first off, julian, i don't know what the story is in greece but in this state we got very definite laws about that...}
<A>__{marty, hunched over the standing safe behind his desk, tosses in the photograph and takes out a pay envelope.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...second place i ain't a messenger, i'm a private investigator. and third place and most important it ain't such bad news. i mean you thought he was a colored.}
<P>__{(he laughs)}
<D>__{...you're always assumin' the worst...}
<A>__{visser blows another smoke ring, pushes a fat finger through the middle of it, and beams at marty.}

<D>__{...anything else?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{yeah, don't come by here any more. if i need you again i know which rock to turn over.}
<A>__{marty scales the pay envelope across the desk. it hits visser in the chest and bounces to the floor. visser looks stonily down at the envelope; no expression for a beat. then he roars with laughter.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{that's good... "which rock to turn over"... that's very good...}
<A>__{sighing, he leans forward to pick up the envelope. he rises, straightens his cowboy hat, and walks over to a screen door letting out on the bar's back parking lot.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{well, gimme a call whenever you wanna cut off my head...}
<A>__{he pauses at the door, cocks his head, then turns back to the desk and picks up his cigarette lighter. returning to the door:}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...i can crawl around without it.}
<A>__{the door slams shut behind him. marty scowls at the back door. after a moment he rises and crosses the office to the window looking out on the bar. over marty's shoulder we see the long bar leading up to the window in perpendicular. the camera is tracking forward, past marty, to frame on the window. a black man is just now vaulting the near end of the bar, over onto the customer side.}

<A>__{a motown song drops. we track behind meurice as he makes his way back toward the bar. when he reaches it, he claps a couple of people on the shoulder, who make way for him. he vaults back over the top, walks down the bar, and stops in from of an attractive white woman sitting on a bar stool and sipping a brandy.}

<D>__{i don't know, didn't he call?}

<C>__{debra}
<D>__{you won't have to. i just wanted to see if you knew.}
