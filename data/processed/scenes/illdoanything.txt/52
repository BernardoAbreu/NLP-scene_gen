<L>__{interior matt's hallway night}
<A>__{we hear a muffled argument between matt and jeannie coming from inside their apartment. then the door opens and matt, holding jeannie by the hand, moves down the hall to the next door and knocks. (note: jeannie is dressed in layers of varied clothing some of the layers play clothes, some fit for a coronation. she is a pocket contemporary annie hall... her style so much her own it transcends judgement. her hair is unkempt. the door opens revealing lucy, an hispanic woman in her mid 30s.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{how're you doing? i'm from next door. i see you with your kids in the laundry room...}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{hello.}
<P>__{(seeing jeannie, turns warmer)}
<D>__{...who are you?}
<A>__{jeannie is a bit shy.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{say, 'hello, i'm your new neighbor now too.'}
<A>__{jeannie says nothing.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i'm lucy crisala... what's your name?}
<A>__{jeannie says nothing.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{say, 'jeannie.'}
<A>__{the form of the conversation is forged. jeannie not answering anything. matt bending over to jeannie while he forms her answers to lucy.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i have a little girl too.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{say, 'isn't that nice... how old is she?'}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{she's four and a half and i have a little boy who is not yet one year.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{say, 'that's nice... i'd like to play with them... my daddy didn't know your phone number, so we just decided to...'}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{what can i do for you?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{say 'daddy has to go to work tonight and...'}
<P>__{(catching himself and}
<D>__{looks directly at}
<P>__{lucy)}
<D>__{i need someone to help me and her on short notice. i've seen your around with your kids and hoped you knew someone in the building or close by. i've got this new job that starts now. do you know anyone?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{well, i'm always here. i could maybe do it myself.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(there is a god and a good one at that)}
<D>__{oh, this is so great. let's work out a full time schedule and...}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{wait. jeannie, why don't you come in for a minute and meet ricky and essa. come on, we're making fruit bars.}
<A>__{jeannie walks into the apartment past her father.}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(again, to matt)}
<D>__{why don't you leave her for a while and then we talk.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{sort of a test?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{we'll just see how it works.}
