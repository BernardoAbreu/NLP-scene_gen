<L>__{int lab night}
<A>__{victor races through the lab with the creature hobbling behind, trying to catch up. victor hurling lab equipment, tipping shelves in its path, anything to slow it down. victor rips the door open, lunges through, slams it in the creature's face. the creature presses against the wood with pathetic little moans, begging not to be left alone. he sinks to the floor. abandoned. shivering with cold. sees victor's greatcoat where it fell. grabs it. drags it over. shrouding himself.}
