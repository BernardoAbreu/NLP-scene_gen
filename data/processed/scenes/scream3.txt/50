<C>__{gale}
<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{dewey shakes his head in disgust, disappears into the house. gale runs back to shut off her car. from out of the bushes lunges tom prinze, loaded off his ass, still holding a half filled bottle of johnny walker black label scotch in his hand.}

<D>__{gale weathers. what a surprise.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{tom prinze, tanked as usual. that's a shocker.}
