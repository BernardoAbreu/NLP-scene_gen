<A>__{rocklin goes to the filing cabinet where he opens the drawer marked "c." as he fingers through the papers, garvey sits back in his chair, watching.}

<D>__{what is your interest in this letter?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{my only interest is getting' it.}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{you realize what this is, don't you? robbing armed robbery at that.}
<A>__{rocklin pulls open the "m" drawer.}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{i warn you, you're in for a disappointment.}
<A>__{not finding the letter in the "m" drawer, rocklin goes to the desk and pulls the handle of one of the drawers. it is locked.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{open up.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(has had about enough)}
<D>__{listens, you }
<P>__{(suddenly controls himself)}
<D>__{there's nothing in there that'd interest you.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{i'd like to make up my own mind about that.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(forces a chuckle)}
<D>__{all right i will open it just to convince you i'm not hiding any letter.}
<A>__{garvey unlocks the drawer and opens it. it is found to contain nothing but two brand new decks of playing cards. the unopened decks of cards. back to scene. garvey seems a little too anxious to close the drawer, and before he can do so, rocklin has one hand inside. garvey, checked for a second, looks up at rocklin.}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{what's the idea?}
<A>__{rocklin slowly withdraws his hand, holding one of the decks.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{these cards }
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(attempting to bluff it out)}
<D>__{anything wrong in a man having cards in his possession?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{depends on what kind they are 'specially when they're under lock and key.}
<A>__{the two regard each other silently a moment. now rocklin casually slips the deck he holds into his pocket.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(too politely)}
<D>__{you're taking those, i presume.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{he takes a step away. garvey turns him by touching his arm.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(has had almost enough)}
<D>__{now, you look here }
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(soberly)}
<D>__{you're the one who better start lookin' lookin' for a way out for killin' red caldwell.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(blanches)}
<D>__{caldwell }
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(takes up one of the decks of cards)}
<D>__{he found out about these and you went and killed him.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(with an affected}
<D>__{smile and unnatural}
<P>__{calmness)}
<D>__{and you believe a story like that?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{i will until i hear a better one.}
<P>__{(puts deck he holds, in his pocket)}
<D>__{i will just take this along the district judge at garden city should be mighty interested.}
<A>__{he starts around the desk toward the door. from the corner of his eye he catches garvey reaching for a gun in the middle drawer. before he can raise it, rocklin is on him with a blow that sends garvey reeling back toward the stove. rocklin starts for the door again, and just misses being struck by a chair which garvey hurls with vicious fury. the chair crashes against a window.}
