<L>__{interior command tent war room rain same morning}
<A>__{nick is moving to take his seat next to elise at this very crowded conference. the big wigs are here and the room is packed. major hicks walks to a large map of manhattan.}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{general anderson, the problem was the terrain. if we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of central park...}
<P>__{(points to the map)}
<D>__{we should be able to take him down.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{last time you didn't even scratch it!}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{that's not true. our worm guy, er, i mean, dr. tatopoulos found blood.}
<A>__{all eyes turn towards nick who's still arranging his papers. nervously nick addresses the crowd.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{well, yes. i did. clearly he was injured and bled.}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{you see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. the blood i recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.}
<C>__{governor}
<D>__{are you trying to tell us there's}
<A>__{another one of those things out}
<D>__{there?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't believe so.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{then how can it be pregnant? what is this, the "virgin lizard?"}
<A>__{there's a smattering of laughter in the room.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no, it reproduces asexually. that's why we must find the nest. if we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{so after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it may be too late by then. these eggs will hatch very quickly.}
<C>__{clive}
<D>__{how could you possible know that?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{the fish. the fish we found down in the subway. he's not gathering all that food for himself. he's preparing to feed his young.}
