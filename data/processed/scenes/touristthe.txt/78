<L>__{interior cara's car night}
<A>__{he climbs into the car. she turns to him as she pulls out.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{did you miss me?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{a little.}
<A>__{he glances anxiously over her shoulder.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{um... you may not believe this but there are some people trying to kill me }
<C>__{cara}
<P>__{(calm)}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{cara drives toward the ramp. he looks at her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{do you know why?}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{it's because i kissed you.}
<A>__{she stops the car and waits for the metal gate at the top of the ramp to open. it rises with a loud creaking to}
<B>__{reveal...}
<A>__{a black car with two men inside. one of them steps out and ducks under the gate as it rises up. while he's briefly silhouetted by the car's headlights we glimpse the outline of an automatic weapon.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{with remarkable sangfroid she cuts the engine and lets her car roll backwards, gliding silently and perfectly into a parking spot. silence. they watch the black car slowly descend the ramp. the russian with the gun in his hand walks carefully alongside. frank watches, holding his breath. the sound of another engine cuts through the silence. a pair of headlights come up from the level below. close on the car. the male nurse from the elevator is driving up toward the exit ramp, toward the exit where the russians are waiting. close on the gunman slipping back into the shadows and readying his gun to fire. frank sees what is about to happen. his face betrays his concern. he reaches for the door. click. cara presses the central door lock. frank's door doesn't budge. he looks over at her.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(re: the nurse)}
<D>__{that guy has nothing to do with this.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{neither do you.}
<A>__{he looks her straight in the eye. she relents.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{okay. if you want to play hero...}
<A>__{she turns over the ignition.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{hold on.}
<A>__{cara revs the car and pulls out fast, cutting off the nurse's car. he leans on the horn. at the top of the exit ramp, the metal parking gate is slowly being lowered. she weaves around the black car, deliberately heading for the gunman. he opens fire. brrrrraaap!! bullets spray wildly, ricocheting off the walls, shattering windshields... frank covers his face as a side window pops, showering him with glass. the gunman is forced to jump out of the way as cara scrapes the side of her car along the wall. sparks fly. the black car burns rubber as it u turns to follow her. she guns it up the ramp towards the closing door.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{there's not enough room!}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{there's enough room.}
<A>__{the fence whirs at head height and keeps lowering. the black car is closing in behind them.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we won't make it!}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{i thought americans were optimists.}
<A>__{at the last second he ducks instinctively and closes his eyes. the gate clips the top of cara's car with a tremendous clang! traps it. cara presses her foot all the way down on the accelerator. smoke pours from the tires. crash! the black car rams them from behind. a russian leans out the window and fires at the outlines of cara and frank's heads. bullets shatter the back window. cara pushes frank's head down. the sound of burning gears as the engine hits its limit. suddenly, scraping paint, cara's car springs forward, jetting out onto the street. the fence drops further and shudders to a halt. the black car is trapped. the russians can only watch as cara speeds away.}
