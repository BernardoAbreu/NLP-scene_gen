<L>__{interior seth's car morning}
<A>__{seth, seventeen, a bit heavyset, in the midst of a sad attempt at growing a goatee and clearly a terrible driver, cruises along while fiddling with the cd player. he pulls out his cell and dials.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yo.}
<L>__{intercut with: interior evan's house kitchen continuous}
<A>__{evan, seventeen, a little too tall and slim, a boy who clearly never figured out how to style his hair, is finishing off a bowl of cereal. he is on his cell phone.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i was doing research last night, for next year, and i think i'm gonna go with bang bus.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{which one's bang bus?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{the one where they bang the chicks on the bus. thirteen bucks a month. total access, live web cam feed. the works. it'll be like i'm on the bus, banging them myself.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{that stuff's bullshit, they're all faking it. and plus, your parents are gonna look at the bill.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{it shows up under a different name.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i hope. bang bus.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{that wouldn't look good. maybe i should just pick the one with the least dirty sounding name.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{weapons of ass destruction's out then.}
<A>__{seth pulls up in front of a house.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i could tell my parents i'm doing a project on rome and i have to research orgies.}

<P>__{(still into phone)}
<D>__{yeah. just tell them your taking a class on blow jobs.}
<A>__{they both hang up and evan gets in the car. seth is about to pull away, when evan's mother comes out the front door.}
<C>__{evan's mom}
<D>__{thanks for taking him, seth.}
<A>__{evan changes the radio station. seth slaps his hand.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{don't touch that!}
<C>__{evan's mom}
<D>__{you two are so funny. i can't imagine what you'll do without each other next year. evan told me you didn't get into state.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yeah, you know. i got some other places. good places. i think we'll be fine.}

<D>__{are you going to miss each other?}

<D>__{miss each other? no!}

<D>__{that's disgusting.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{bye, boys.}

<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i am truly, truly jealous that you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby.}

<D>__{fuck you, man.}
<L>__{exterior clark secondary soon after}
<A>__{they drive up to clark secondary. there is a giant sign that reads "seniors two glorious weeks until graduation". seth turns into the staff parking lot.}

<A>__{seth and evan walk past a group of smokers, towards the 7 11.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you're being an idiot, man. you really shouldn't park there.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{fuck it. i'm a senior about to graduate. they should be suckin' my balls. it's the least they can do for stealing three years of my life.}
<A>__{they walk past dimitri (18, big native american guy) as they enter the store. dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into seth.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what the hell's wrong with dimitri?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{oh, yeah dude, i forgot to tell you. i knocked the fuckin' shit out of him in capture the flag last week.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{good! 9th grade camp he gave me whiplash in "king of the ring." i fucking hate that guy.}
<A>__{they go to the magazine rack and stare at a maxim cover.}
<C>__{evan }
<D>__{look at those nipples.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{they're like baby toes.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{it's not fair. i have to hide every erection i get.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{sometimes i get boners so big i can't hide them. and then i get nervous and my heart starts pounding, and it all just, like, feeds my boner. it just becomes this...thing...that's attached to me. and it won't go away.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners and they actually wanted to see `em, like this shit.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you know it's been, like, a year and a half since i've seen an actual human female nipple. besides my mom's. i saw it last month, and it was sick.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{holy shit. liat was two years ago? i guess so. she was insanely hot, though.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{exactly. too hot. that's what sucks.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{how can that possibly suck? i'd be fuckin' psyched if i'd gotten with a girl that hot. you got, like, two dozen handjobs!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{and three quarters of a blowjob, but that was fuckin' it. it was the peak of my ass gettin' career, and it happened way, way, way too early.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you're like orson welles.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{exactly! if i'd built up to it, i'd probably at least be having steady sex with a mediocre looking girl at this pointerior i honestly now see why orson welles ate his fat ass to death.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you'll have sex in college. everyone does. and if not, you'll have the bang bus.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{but the key is to be good at sex by the time you're in college. you don't want girls to think you suck dick at fucking.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i still think you've got a chance with jules. she got mad hot over last summer, and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause she still flirts with you.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{are you joking, man? let's see here...she dated dan remick, matt muir, josh corber and what's his face. all of those were cool guys. she's been hot way longer than you think. why would she end her high school career with me?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{well, helen got with ariel shafir.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yeah, and he was a complete fucking loser. you're a step up from that. which is why you should stop being a pussy and do her! you could nailthe shit out of her for, like, two months before you leave. that bitch looks like a good fucker.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{hey! i'm sick of you talking about her like that, man!}
<A>__{evan starts to walk out. seth follows.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what, you can talk about that bitch all day every single day, but i can't say one thing about her?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i don't constantly insult her.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i didn't insult her! i said she looks like a good fucker! she looks like she can take a dick. that's a good thing. some women pride themselves on their dick taking abilities.}
<L>__{exterior 7 11 continuous}

<A>__{terry spits on seth's shirt.}
<C>__{terry }
<D>__{and you're not coming. tell your fucking faggot friend he can't come either.}
<A>__{seth wipes the spit off. he looks at terry and seems as though he's about to say something, but is interrupted when terry starts hocking up more spit. seth runs away as terry and his friends laugh. he catches up to evan and they head back to school.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{wow. you really bitched out on that one.}
<C>__{seth}

<C>__{seth}

<D>__{killing me won't get you any alcohol, jerkoff! i'm the one with the id!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{then i will kill you, cut off your ugly face, put it over mine, and buy it my fucking self.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{you don't have the technology or the steady hands to pull off a procedure like that!}
<A>__{seth stands for a moment, then suddenly rushes fogell. evan stands between them and breaks it up.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{seth, calm down! fogell, stop being a baby and go buy the alcohol! you said you'd do it, so do it. it's why you bought the id, so just go do it.}
<C>__{fogell}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will try.}
<A>__{fogell walks into the store.}
<L>__{interior liquor store continuous}
<A>__{at first it all seems overwhelming. fogell is confused, dizzy, and sweating. he steps behind a large beer display and takes a few deep breaths.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{hi there.}
<A>__{fogell flinches, shocked someone spoke to him. he keeps walking. he nears a mother and her 17 year old son. as fogell passes them, the son seems to recognize him. fogell clearly recognizes the son. their eyes meet. fogell looks in the opposite direction.}
<C>__{son}
<D>__{fogell?}
<C>__{fogell}
<P>__{(weird voice, covering his face)}
<D>__{no.}

<C>__{moscovitch}
<P>__{(knowingly)}
<D>__{oh, oh. cool, cool. good luck.}
<A>__{he puts his head down and quickly walks away. he arrives at the beer and cooler section. clearly intimidated, he slowly opens a beer fridge. he grabs one beer attached to a six pack and pulls it forward. the beer comes loose in his hand as the other five fall to the ground, cracking on impact, and spraying beer all over the place. fogell scrambles to stop the beers from spraying, but soon finds that it is impossible.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{fuck.}
<A>__{a clerk approaches fogell.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{is there a problem, sir?}

<D>__{i think it happened before.}

<D>__{i think i would know, thank you.}

<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i'm gonna go down on her for, like, hours. she'll love that. she'll want to go out with that.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{yeah, but i figured there's no harm in bringing just one little condom.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{and one little bottle of spermicidal lube. that's nuts. you can't let her know you brought that! these girls are 18, not dried up old ladies. they're ready to go.}

<C>__{evan}
<D>__{that was a waste.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{check it out! the cops!}
<A>__{they see a cop car with the lights flashing parked outside the liquor store. seth and evan cautiously approach the liquor store and look inside. they see two police talking with the cashier, and fogell is standing right beside them!}

<D>__{shit! they busted fogell!}
<L>__{interior liquor store continuous}
<A>__{the two police, officer slater, 30 and experienced, and officer michaels, 25 and learning, are talking to the cashier. fogell stands beside them, nervous and afraid.}

<D>__{so, did he punch anyone else?}
<C>__{cashier}
<P>__{(losing it completely)}

<P>__{(turn to fogell)}
<D>__{so then, son, you're the one that got punched?}
<A>__{fogell looks down to his bags of liquor at his feet. then back at the cops. he nods.}

<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{oh...that's uh...a good one...it's a...an interesting...uh...event...}
<A>__{fogell trails off mumbling and starts to breathe heavily, making an odd noise. behind him, in the window of the store, we see seth and evan peeking through.}
<L>__{exterior liquor store continuous}
<A>__{shocked, seth and evan walk away from the window. seth starts to pace in anger.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i don't believe this bullshit! i can't...this isn't happening! i didn't even know you could get arrested for this shit! we need that fucking liquor!}

<C>__{seth}
<D>__{that doesn't matter anymore. i just lost a hundred dollars of jules' money!}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{we have to help him!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{help him? what are we gonna do? bust him out of jail? i don't even know where jail is! what we need is the alcohol, which is impossible because we don't have any fucking money!}

<L>__{interior liquor store continuous}
<A>__{the cops are still talking to fogell. he looks completely flustered. he's lost his composure.}
<C>__{officer slater}
<D>__{okay, your name is just mclovin, there's no need to get irrational.}
<A>__{in the background (not in the view of fogell and the cops) we see driver of the car, a shady looking guy in a hockey jersey, gets out of his car and walks over to where seth is lying, apologizing frantically.}
<C>__{officer michaels}
<D>__{a lot of people have strange names these days.}
<C>__{officer slater}
<D>__{i once arrested a man lady who was legally named "pearl necklace."}

<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{um...okay...}
<A>__{fogell takes his shaking, sweaty hand, sticks it in his pocket, and pulls out his fake id. he slowly hands it over to officer slater. the cops both look at it, then fogell. beads of sweat are running down fogell's face. in the background, seth pops up and starts kicking the guy's car out of anger. evan and the driver both restrain seth.}
<C>__{officer slater}
<D>__{you're an organ donor?}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{officer slater}
<D>__{i didn't want to be one but my wife insisted.}
<C>__{officer michaels}
<D>__{just like a woman. even after you're dead, they want to tear your heart out.}
<A>__{the officers start laughing. fogell is shocked. they hand back the id.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{look. i'm really sorry, but i don't really have any information. i didn't really see him. his fist hit here.}

<L>__{interior evan's house basement the next morning}
<A>__{evan wakes up and looks over at seth, who is also waking. they look at each other extremely awkwardly, almost as though they drunkenly had sex with each other last night.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{oh...uh...hey. morning.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{uh...morning.}
<A>__{they stare at each other, uncomfortable.}

<C>__{evan}
<D>__{um...}

<L>__{interior department store next day}
<A>__{evan is standing in the pants section of a department store. seth walks out of the dressing room wearing jeans that are way too small.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{don't ask me. i don't give a shit if your pants look good.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{well, i need someone's opinion.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{fine. they're way too small.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yeah, but when i was wearing your dad's pants last night i realized that if i buy pants that are too small it'll encourage me to lose weight. and in tight pants chicks'll kind of see my dick a little.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{yeah, the male camel toe look is really big this year.}
<A>__{seth goes back into the dressing room and wriggles out of the pants. he walks out.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{these pants suck. let's the get the fuck out of here.}
<L>__{interior department store}
<A>__{they walk through the department store, when suddenly, evan sees helen and jules looking at comforters. angle on: helen and jules}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{again, i'm so sorry. i can't believe i actually did that.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i feel sorry that i'm making you buy me a new one.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i have to. it's puke.}
<A>__{angle on: seth and evan}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{holy shit!}
<A>__{helen looks like hell and jules has a horrible black eye.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{is that them?}
<A>__{they stare at the two girls from afar.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{should we hide?}
<A>__{helen looks and notices them. she waves and points them out to jules. seth and evan wave back. the girls get up and start to walk over.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(pretending to smile)}
<D>__{fuck that, man. i can't talk to her, look what i did to her!}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(pretending to smile)}
<D>__{helen called me a pussy to my face! what am i going to say to her?}
<A>__{the girls walk up to them.}
<C>__{helen jules}
<A>__{hi evan, seth. hey guys.}

<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(to helen)}
<D>__{how are you feeling?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{not bad, but not great, how about you?}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to jules)}
<D>__{that looks terrible. no! i mean, it doesn't look terrible, it looks }
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{don't worry about it, seth. it was an accident.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(to helen)}
<D>__{did you have fun last night?}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(to seth)}
<D>__{do you remember much?}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(to evan)}
<D>__{i really don't remember much.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to jules)}
<D>__{not really. i remember looking up, and you screaming at me. that's about it.}
<A>__{jules laughs.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(to evan)}
<D>__{i didn't puke on you, did i?}
<A>__{evan laughs.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{no, i dodged it. whizzed right by me.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to jules)}
<D>__{but seriously, i acted like a fuckin' idiot last night. i'm really sorry, you didn't deserve that.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(to evan)}
<D>__{yeah, i...um...i'm sorry, about all that. thanks for being such a gentleman.}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you look good with a black eye.}
<A>__{they all chuckle a little.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{thanks, smart guy. that's why i'm here. i have to go to macy's to get a shitload of cover up for the grad photo.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(mortified)}
<D>__{oh man...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yeah, and i'm going to linen brothers to buy jules a new comforter.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{oh! i have to get a comforter too, for college.}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(flirtatiously, joking)}
<D>__{so, you gonna come with me to macy's and buy me my cover up, or what?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yes! definitely. i'd love to. i had such bad acne last year, i became an expert on the stuff.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you could get your college pants there.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yeah, but wait...you drove me here, evan drove me here, how do we }
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i've got my dad's car. i will take you home, and evan can give helen a lift.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that sounds good.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{maybe we can go eat after?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{sweet.}
<A>__{seth and evan look at each other, odd smiles on both their faces. they didn't blow it.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{so, uh, i will call you later.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{yeah man, have a good one.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{come on, seth. let's go.}
<A>__{jules pulls seth away. evan and helen start walking in the opposite direction. as they walk away from one another, seth and evan look back and give each other a small and yet emotionally charged wave. a slow, gut wrenching soul song starts to play. they look as though they're never going to see each other again.}
<L>__{interior macy's escalator}
<A>__{as jules and seth walk into macy's and helen and evan descend an escalator, the music swells to a mind fuckingly awesome crescendo, and we humbly fade to black...}
<B>__{the end}
<T>__{end credit sequence:}
<A>__{we flip through seth's seemingly endless penis drawings from childhood. they are hilarious.}
