<A>__{joan is talking on the phone with her son. her demeanor is entirely different a tone and physicality we've not seen.}

<A>__{tim sees that joan's computer is open and his two diamond presentation is up on the screen.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{is that...? were you looking at my two diamond presentation?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{your cell phone kept ringing in your little fanny pack thing, so i shut it off. when i saw the discs, i figured i'd take a look. it's a solid presentation.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{um. thanks. it was roger lemke's...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{yeah, i see that.}
<P>__{(wistful beat)}

<C>__{tim}
<D>__{what? whaddaya...? you and... you and roger, you mean?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{it's so stupid but everyone basically treated us like the brangelina of asmi for a while there. it ended two years ago. he was getting into some pretty weird stuff... as we all know now.}
<A>__{tim is livid. he ejects his disc from joan's computer.}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{come on, lippe. it doesn't matter. you knew, didn't you?}
<C>__{tim}

<C>__{joan}
<D>__{tell me you're not jealous. you can't be jealous. the guy's dead.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{every stinkin' place i go people remind me: you're no roger lemke. you're not as good as roger lemke. here we go again.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{as good? tim, roger was a small minded, egotistical jerk. you're an infinitely better man than he was.}
<A>__{this stops tim in his tracks. better than roger lemke. wow.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{why were you with him then?}
<A>__{this stops joan in her tracks. her inner pain percolates.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{why? i don't know. i don't know. i guess i probably maybe don't like myself very much. i don't know.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{hey, hey. come on. you're pretty and smart and just super awesome.}
<P>__{(coy)}
<D>__{i like you.}
<A>__{she allows a chuckle. tim rubs her shoulders, supportive.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{grrr. i'm so frickin' confused. last thing i thought was that i'd come to cedar rapids and fall in love.}
<A>__{joan shakes him off.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{us. this.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{what this? what are you talking about? there's no this. there's no us. i have a family.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{what about...?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{what about it? i told you, what i do here... in cedar rapids... it stays here.}
<A>__{tim gets up, even more pissed off than he was before.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{where the heck are my clothes?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{come on, tim. we're adults here. you're acting like a child...}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{yeah. well, you're acting like a fricking... prostitute.}
<A>__{he wraps up in a towel, grabs his money cummerbund and goes. a moment. joan looks at the rumpled bed sheets, starts making the bed. as she does, she sees the clairol nice `n' easy hair dye box in the garbage. joan smiles a what has become of my life smile. she sits on the bed and stares out the window.}
