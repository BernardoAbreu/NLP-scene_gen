<L>__{82: interior bathroom living room. apartment. night.}
<A>__{if there's moonlight that's the only light. nothing to see but a pair of large taps. nothing to hear but a bath filling. then something starts bleeping. it's a liquid level indicator activ ated by rising water. a hand searches for taps. shuts them off and silences the indicator. the frame expands to reveal helena. she moves to a hand basin. finds a brush and fixes hair. finds a clip and pins it up. close as she kicks off shoes. pantyhose descend on top of them. walks into the living room unbuttoning her shirt. vanishes into the bedroom and the camera waits. ret urns with towels and the camera follows back into the bathroom. a creaking hinge as she closes the door. a dressing gown hangs on a hook. she reaches for it and turns and virtually bumps in to the sonovabitch. dressed in black and stealthy as a cat. he retreats a pace deeper into the darkness. just enough light to see he wears glasses. and just enough light to see her undress. helena unzips her skirt. slides it down her lags. drapes it on a chair. removes her shirt and hangs it on the back. she wears a white brassiere and panties. and no apologies for repetition. this is a fantastic body. she checks water temperature. either too hot or too cold. either way a tap goes on. now she reaches behind her back. unclips her bra. gets hit with dazzling light. the intruder is taking photographs. and if this is his turn on he's in paradise. she stands in front of him in total oblivion. her panties join clothes on the chair. nov she's naked and now another picture. again the bathroom detonates with white light. his face is concealed by the camera. but this bastard is about to run out of luck. moves in as she silences the tap. suddenly a lot of silence about. helena twists in panic. she just heard something? didn't she just hear something? is somebody in here? fear kills her scream. she hits at the darkness. but he's gone.}
