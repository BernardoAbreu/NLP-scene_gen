<T>__{her pov:}
<A>__{a vent above the sink, near the ceiling.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{she puts a foot up into the sink, testing it to see if it can take her weight. then climbs up and straightens on wobbly legs, until her face is near the filthy dust clogged vent.}
<C>__{girl }
<P>__{(calling into vent)}
<D>__{hey. can anybody hear me?! hey!}
<A>__{her voice echoes weirdly. when the echoes die down she hears something from the vent that makes her scowl: laughter. as if our guy and the clerk are having a good laugh at her expense. pissed off now, she climbs back down, and attacks the broken doorknob with renewed urgency. and finally succeeds in getting the door to open.}
