<L>__{interior smiley mart night}
<A>__{trip leafs through a kiss comic, not really paying attention to it. directly behind him is the register and the cashier. he starts hearing voices in his head. we see supers of his friends' faces hovering around him.}
<C>__{lex's voice}
<D>__{i can't believe you're even thinking of committing a robbery, trip. you don't pass go and collect 200 dollars for pulling stuff like this.}
<C>__{hawk's voice}
<D>__{no shit, dude, is this really worth it? sure you get your ass kicked nine ways to sunday by that fucking gorilla, but it's still a hundred times better than getting it porked for the next three to five.}
<A>__{trip sends brief, agitated glances around the store meeting the cashier's eyes again. she smiles at him coyly as she plays with her mood ring. he gives her the eye, then returns to his comic.}
<C>__{jam's voice}
<D>__{and what about that girl, trip? she'll never forget this night. even if you get away with it, she'll be scarred for life. when are you gonna realize sometimes being tough means being tender.}
<C>__{trip}
<P>__{(to the other voices)}
<D>__{alright, everybody, shut up!}
<A>__{trip snaps out of it. all the shoppers and cashier are starring at him. he coughs loudly, clearing his throat to cover his outburst. the shoppers go back to shopping. a man with a long coat enters the store, looks around, then takes a spot alongside trip and opens a mad magazine.}
<C>__{trip}
<P>__{(whispering to himself)}
<D>__{okay, bro. you gonna have to do this sometime. might as well be now.}
<A>__{trip puts a hand in his pocket and takes one last look at stretch armstrong before stuffing the action figure back in so it looks like he's got a gun. he takes three deep breaths and discreetly pulls his knit cap down over his eyes, revealing it actually as a semi ski mask that covers the top half of his face. just then, the man with the coat puts the magazine back and pulls something over his own head. trip whirls around pointing stretch in his pocket at the cashier... just as the man in the coat, now masked with a stocking, pulls the biggest shotgun ever made from under his coat, pointing it at the cashier as well. the cashier shrieks. so does trip.}
<C>__{man with coat}
<D>__{evening, honey. y'know what i am, what this is, and what you have to do, so do it quick.}
<P>__{(to shoppers, trip included)}
<D>__{the rest of you kindly introduce yourselves to the floor and kiss it hello.}
<A>__{his thunder now stolen, trip drops to the floor along with everyone else. the air is very tense. the cashier starts sobbing, keeping her hands in the air.}
<C>__{man with coat}
<P>__{(to cashier)}
<D>__{do or die, bitch! next time i let the barrels do the talking.}
<C>__{cashier}
<D>__{p p please, mister, i'm just a high school kid...}
<A>__{man with the coat cocks the chamber and the cashier immediately opens the register drawer and starts emptying it.}
<C>__{man with coat}
<D>__{fuck school, that's what i say! i just went through the motions till i was old enough to drop out and i'm leaving here with at least two fifty the easy way. look where all that studying's gonna get you tonight. robbed at gunpoint and possibly shot in the fucking head... for minimum wage!}
<A>__{the man with the coat's laughter echoes in trip's head till he just can't take it anymore.}
<B>__{on the cashier}
<A>__{she suddenly shoots a surprise glance over the man with the coat's shoulder. seeing this, the man spins around. there's trip behind him.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{alright, drop it or i will kick your ass!}
<A>__{astounded by trip's audacity, the man with the coat turns his shotgun point blank at trip.}
<C>__{man with coat}
<D>__{oh, yeah! you and what army?}
<C>__{trip}
<P>__{(gulps)}
<D>__{the kiss army!}
<C>__{crashing backstage}
