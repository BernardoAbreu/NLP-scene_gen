<A>__{it floats rapidly at her, hissing. buffy looks about her frantically, trapped. it hits her at top speed and she instantly rolls onto her back, flipping it and hurling it against the wall at the end of the alley. as it hits, buffy, still rolling, produces a stake from her jacket and throws it directly at its heart. the stake punctures the startled creature's chest. before he can so much as grab it, buffy throws a roundhouse kick, driving the stake all the way home with her foot. the vampire screams, sinks to the ground. buffy turns, triumphant.}
