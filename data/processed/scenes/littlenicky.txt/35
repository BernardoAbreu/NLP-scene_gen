<L>__{exterior side street day}
<A>__{nicky is searching the street for his flask. he walks past several street vendors who have set up their wares on the sidewalk. pause. nicky comes walking back into frame as he sees his flask (and half eaten drumstick) laying on the blanket of the vendor.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{hey...}
<C>__{street vendor}
<D>__{see something you like, my man?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{yes. i would like my flask back.}
<A>__{the street vendor stands, very angry.}
<C>__{street vendor}
<D>__{you callin' me a thief, my man?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{no, i'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.}
<C>__{street vendor}
<D>__{and if that is your so called "flask," how would i have it unless i was, in fact, a thief?}
<C>__{nicky}
<P>__{(not sure what the answer is)}
<D>__{i don't know?}
<A>__{a yuppie jogger is checking out the flask.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{yeah, how much for the silver flask there?}
<C>__{street vendor}
<D>__{well, that's a very special item. the cap itself is one hundred percent plappium. it's a value is over three thousand dollars.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{really. where's it from?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{it was handcrafted in hell by satan himself and is only to be used for the capture and containment of my blood brothers so that the firefall of hades will burn brightly once again.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{really. i think we'll let you keep it then.}
<A>__{he walks away.}
<C>__{street vendor}
<D>__{okay, now you gone and done it. you done messed with my business bitch!}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{sir, i would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. it's making my muscles tighten.}
<A>__{we see that nicky's eyes are starting to glow red.}
<C>__{street vendor}
<D>__{oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me? i will show you some crazy eyes. let's get busy.}
<A>__{the vendor makes an even crazier face at nicky and starts swinging his fists around. nearby, valerie, an unsure, sweetly unstylish young woman, is selling clothes off a spread out blanket. she notices what's going on. nicky's eyes widen in panic. just then, valerie steps in.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{excuse me, does that flask belong to this man?}
<C>__{street vendor}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{now you callin' me a thief? damn.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{look, i know you come out here and sell stolen stuff all the time. but today, the guy you stole from just happened to walk by and bust you. so why don't you admit today's not your day and give him his flask back?}
<C>__{street vendor}
<D>__{or what're you gonna do about it? ugly me to death?}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{no, but maybe that cop over there might have something to say.}
<A>__{valerie points to a cop across the street. the street vendor ponders this for a second, then...}
<C>__{street vendor}
<D>__{aw, take your dumb ass canteen, goofy.}
<P>__{(looking at valerie)}
<D>__{and you, take your raggedy ass clothes and find a new corner. before i show you what real crazy is.}
<A>__{the vendor does crazy eyes again.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{fine. i will.}
<A>__{nicky picks up the flask and the drumstick.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{hey, mister. i will be seeing you in a few years.}
<A>__{valerie gathers her blanket, starts walking away and nicky follows her.}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{that was amazing. thanks so much. you didn't have to do that.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{that's okay. i get messed with all the time and when i saw him doing that to you i just lost it. i hate when people take advantage of tourists. it ruins it for the rest of us.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you think i'm a tourist?}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i just assumed. your accent maybe. where are you from?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{the south.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{yeah. deep south.}
<P>__{(laughs hard)}
<A>__{she laughs along with him, not sure why.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{why are you laughing?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i don't know, but i like it. say. your glasses are nice. they make your eyes look sparkly and big. it's fun to look at them.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{my dad's an optometrist.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{my dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's really tough when your parents get older.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{if i don't save him, i don't know what i'm gonna do.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{well, i'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.}
<A>__{nicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her. he hands her the half eaten drumstick.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{here, have a popeye's. this drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{that's alright. i already ate lunch. i actually wouldn't mind getting a gelati.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{could i come with you to getting a gelati?}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{if you want to.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{want to? a million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{"octopus people?"}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{uh, it's a deep south expression.}
<A>__{nicky laughs.}
