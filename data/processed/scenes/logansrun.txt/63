<A>__{as the sandmen monitoring see the signal flash and move smoothly into action.}
<B>__{logan and jessica}
<A>__{close together, he behind, waiting alert as a voice is suddenly heard:}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(scratchy, filtered)}
<D>__{sandman, put your hands on your head.}
<P>__{(he does)}
<D>__{clasp your fingers together. now turn your hands over. palms up.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{in a moment a light will shine in your eyes. walk into it jessica first, then you, sandman. you will have to stoop but don't unclasp your hands. do you agree?}
<A>__{logan nods. jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the dark. then suddenly in front of her a blindingly bright, narrow rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely. jessica moves forward. even she has to stoop. logan is close behind. as he bends awkwardly into the opening, the light goes out. logan, jessica sanctuary hq as he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the side, pulling her with him.. the move fails. both are pinned helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden appearance of glass silver spear points pressed against them. logan is unable to draw his gun.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hold still, sandman, or die where you are. 2nd voice is she the one?}
<C>__{other voices}
<P>__{(like angry stage whispers)}
<D>__{she betrayed us. kill him. kill them both. jessica you sold us. sandman butcher. sandman murderer.}
<A>__{logan and jessica stand rigid against the spear points, only their heads turning to the echoing sibilants.. the spotlight goes off.}
