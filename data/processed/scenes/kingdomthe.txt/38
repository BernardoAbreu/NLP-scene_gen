<A>__{colonel al ghazi, saudi police, 45 years old, mustache as thick as sykes'. a firecracker loud crack makes him flinch. he stands in the back of the room, not participating in the interrogation. just observing. clearly not happy about what he's observing. his pov: the officer from the second land cruiser that rammed the fake and killed those inside, sergeant haytham. slab cuffed and being worked over hard buy a couple of thick fisted saudis.. silent tears roll off his cheek, left ear split ghastly. a man standing far right of him beats him: the firecracker sound again. al ghazi looks away, biting his tongue. obviously wants this over. in charge of the interrogation: general abdul malik. he doesn't appear sadistic, but very determined to get the truth from sergeant haytham by any means necessary. those distinctions blur easily. malik gives a `hold up' signal. the following exchange in arabic:}
<D>__{general abdul malik no falsehoods, sergeant haytham. what was your involvement?}
<C>__{sergeant haytham}
<D>__{killing those i saw responsible. general abdul malik so none could be questioned?}
<C>__{sergeant haytham}

<D>__{general abdul malik we found six more uniforms than you were assigned in your possession that is a crime: especially when you consider the attackers wore our uniform...}
<A>__{another nod, another crack. al ghazi, flinching, becomes more alert.}
