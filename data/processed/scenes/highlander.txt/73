<L>__{interior conor's home}
<A>__{romirez enters and flops onto a cot. settling down for a nap, he sets his sword beneath the bed and closes his eyes to the distant sound of children playing. the room is still. romirez begins to drowse. suddenly his eyes leap open with full alertness. his hand moves under the cot. with an explosion the front door is lifted from its hinges and splintered into fragments. passing through a cloud of sawdust enters the knight. without pause he topples a kitchen shelf onto a supine romirez.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{romirez. what a surprise.}
<A>__{romirez is struggling under the debris. the knight thrusts hard onto an exposed leg. the limb is severed.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{madonna!}
<A>__{the knight begins casting aside the shelving. with lightning speed romirez pulls the sword from beneath the bed and hammers it deep into the knight's side.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{bastard!}
<A>__{he crashes back against the wall. romirez tries to lift himself from the bed using his sword as a crutch. the knight has regained a meager balance on his knees. blood pours from the slice in his stomach, romirez pushes himself across the bed, plants his sword into the floor and hobbles a few paces before collapsing.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{oh, santa maria!}
<A>__{the knight crawls across the bed and drops to his knees beside romirez.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{why run?}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{demonio!}
<A>__{the knight's trembling hands raise his shaking sword high.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{to hell with you.}
