<L>__{exterior chelsea football ground. side streets night.}
<D>__{crowds of football supporters are streaming away from the football stadium, where the floodlights are still casting their glow. there are arsenal and chelsea supporters on opposite sides of the street and there is some mildly vicious yelling between the two groups. police are visibly keeping order. among the crowd we see ekrem. he seems slightly drunk on top of his normal craziness. he has an arsenal scarf around his neck and is looking for trouble, jeering at the chelsea supporters across the street.}
<C>__{ekrem}
<D>__{hey! hey kabuka chelsea! fuck you!! yeah you! aliverisme!! fucker! a policeman steps up to ekrem and gives him a shove and he stumbles a little. as he gets to his feet we notice two chechen men who are trailing ekrem, ducking their heads away from the line of policemen.}
