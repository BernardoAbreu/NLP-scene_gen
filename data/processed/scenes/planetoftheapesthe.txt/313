<L>__{383 back to taylor and zaius}
<A>__{taylor lift's the muzzle of his rifle and presses it against the back of zaius' head.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i ought to kill you right now.}
<P>__{(nudging him)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{they move off down the trail.}
<L>__{exterior archeological camp med. shot day}
<A>__{zira rushes down the trail to lucius, who is sprawled on the ground. he has a bloody nose and a lump on his forehead. nova and cornelius come next, then taylor, prodding zaius ahead of him at gun pointerior lucius appears to be more humiliated than hurt.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{they took me by surprise. sneaked up on me while i was watering the horses. what's happened to honor?}
<P>__{(pause, glum)}
<D>__{i got off one round to warn you.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(gloomingly)}
<D>__{they've taken everything.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{not everything. they left a hostage.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{how do you feel, lucius?}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{disillusioned...}
<P>__{(turning on)}
<D>__{but vindicated! i've been right all along. you can't trust the older generation. it's a matter of values }
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{all right, all right. will you do me a favor? no orders.}
<C>__{lucius}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.}
<C>__{lucius}
<P>__{(thoughtfull pause)}
<D>__{yes, i can do that.}
<C>__{tayl0r}
<D>__{good. say i want a week's supply of food for the woman and myself. a horse. a spade. and fifty rounds of ammunition.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{what if they won't agree to your terms?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{then tell them dr. zaius won't leave here alive.}
<C>__{zira}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{taylor, you can't.}
<C>__{zaius}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{oh yes he can. he's a born killer.}
<P>__{(to lucius)}
<D>__{deliver the message.}
<A>__{lucius looks to taylor for confirmation. taylor nods. the young ape hurries away through the rocks. taylor crosses to a useless saddle, picks up a coil of rope, gestures at zaius, indicating a nearby tree.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{sit down. over there.}
<A>__{zaius squats on the ground beside the tree. taylor sets his rifle against the trunk, fashions a noose and places it around zaius' neck. then, using an ingenious combination of knots, he ties zaius' hands behind his back, and finally fastens the rope around the base of the tree.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(as he works)}
<D>__{now, minister of science let me explain certain principle stress and strain. if you exert pressure to remove these bonds, you'll choke yourself to death. it'll be suicide, you see?}
<A>__{zira and cornelius look down at the captive mandarin. their rebellious spirit has evaporated, and they are clearly afraid.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{taylor, please don't treat him that way.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{it's humiliating.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{wasn't i humiliated? by all of you? didn't you lead me around on a leash?}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{that was different. we thought you were .... inferior.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(wintry smile)}
<D>__{and now you know the truth.}
<P>__{(to zaius)}
<D>__{cornelius has beaten you, doctor. he proved it. man preceded you here. you owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.}
<C>__{zaius}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{then answer this: if ran was superior, why didn't he survive?}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{he might have been wiped out by a plague. natural catastrophe. like a fiery storm of meteors. from the looks of this part of your planet, i'd say that was a fair bet. zira,}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{but we can't be sure.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(indicating zaius)}
<D>__{he is. he knew all the time. long before your discovery, he knew.}
<P>__{(to zaius)}
<D>__{defender of the faith. guardian of the terrible secret. isn't that right, doctor?}
