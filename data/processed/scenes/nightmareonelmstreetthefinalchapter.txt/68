<D>__{how can you do this?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{do what? i'm not doing anything.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{exactly. after all we've been through you just throw in the towel. why?}
<C>__{jacob}

<C>__{karen}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i don't. but, it's all just too much. i've tried so hard and nothing's worked. i'm spent. i'm wasted. i'm...i'm so tired.}

<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{i've had enough.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{so you're just going to give up? i will bet that's something your mother never taught you.}
<A>__{that hit home. jacob uncovers his face. his id bracelet dangles from his wrist. he looks at the bracelet. alice glints in the setting sunlight. he remembers. jacob looks up at karen.}
