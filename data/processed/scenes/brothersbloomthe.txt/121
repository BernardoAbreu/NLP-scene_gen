<A>__{bloom's breathing slows. he closes his eyes. a beat. then light snoring breaks the silence, coming through the wall. penelope snoring. bloom smiles slightly. what a cute snore. the snoring deepens slightly. the clock on the wall advances from 1:30am to 5:50am, and through the window the horizon glows with the approach of dawn. bloom lies wide awake on his back, red rimmed eyes wide open, the guttural snoring ringing in his ears.}
