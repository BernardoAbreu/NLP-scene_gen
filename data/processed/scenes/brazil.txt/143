<L>__{interior black maria evening}
<A>__{the baggees hang from a track on the ceiling of the black maria. sam is lying on the floor, covered by his jacket, with his badge prominently displayed. he is dazed and mumbling ... the only baggee in the wagon apart from two guards who have removed their helmets and are relaxing while travelling back to base.}
<C>__{guard a}
<P>__{(scratching his head)}
<D>__{these helmets don't half make your scalp itch.}
<C>__{guard b}
<D>__{ooh, don't mention it.}
<P>__{(beginning to scratch his head)}
<D>__{and they make you sweat. half the time i can't see where i'm going there's a great niagara of perspiration coming down.}
<C>__{guard a}
<D>__{i'm lucky, i've got thick eyebrows. that keeps it up and channels it out to my ears.}
<A>__{sam stirs and groans}
<C>__{guard b}
<D>__{who's he?}
<C>__{guard a}
<D>__{someone from information retrieval they're always hanging about in lingerie.}
<A>__{sam is coming to his senses. he takes in the situation, sees all the baggees and staggers to his knees.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{jill! jill! are you there?!}
<A>__{he begins rummaging through the baggees. one of which is dressed as father christmas. sam opens the "face vent" of the baggee's' hoods. a pair of strange eyes look out.}
<C>__{guard a}
<D>__{excuse me, sir that's government property.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{is here a girl here? tall, fair hair, blue eyes?}
<C>__{guard a}
<D>__{dunno sir. they check all that at the depot.}
<A>__{sam continues fumbling about the baggees.}
<C>__{guard 3}
<P>__{(pulling sam back)}
<D>__{we can't allow you to do that sir, it's more than our job's worth.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(shaking guard off)}
<D>__{i've got to find her! jill! jill!}
<C>__{guard a}
<D>__{you can always fill in an application form, if you're a relative, sir. please stop, sir.}
<A>__{sam takes no notice.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{jill! jill!}
<A>__{guard a hits sam, knocking him out again.}
<C>__{guard a}
<D>__{sorry about that sir. regulations. we'll have you safely back in your office in no time.}
