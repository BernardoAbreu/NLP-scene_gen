<A>__{camera is low, moving across the paisley carpet. dim light, spilling through the stained glass windows, falls upon the creepy decor, appearing as if designed by a morose laura ashley, floor model coffins and urns. camera continues, tilting up to the ceiling, revealing a stained glass skylight. outside, on the roof, two silhouettes appear... the skylight hinges crack open. clear leads the way. lifting the frame, then dropping it throught the skylight window. alex is not as smooth as his socius criminus. using his knee to slow his descent, he hangs from the sill for a moment before dropping to the carpet. camera moves with alex and clear through the unsettling reception area; plastic flowers, gold candelabra, plaster cherubs and angels. a bronze plaque identifies: "mt. abraham funeral home. the journey's end. william bludworth intermediary."}
