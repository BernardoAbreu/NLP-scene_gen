<A>__{nick makes his way past the arbor, crestfallen. sheeni emerges from the shadows in a hooded sweatshirt over a lavender dress.}

<A>__{sheeni takes a step back at the notion.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{i don't know, nick. i do love you, but i don't want to spend the rest of our lives on the run.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's a small price to pay.}
<A>__{she takes another step back.}
