<A>__{raymond's speech plays, low, on a television, and half a dozen delegates and power players with "arthur for president" buttons grimly watch ellie breeze in. party chairman vaughn utly anticipates her:}

<P>__{(smiling:)}
<D>__{before we get started, i'm dying to know: which genius here hatched the scheme of pairing a sound bite from nebraska with a relic who thinks keeping suicide bombers off our busses is unconstitutional?}
<C>__{utly}
<D>__{all the research indicates that an arthur jordan ticket sits quite well with the american public and }

<C>__{senator wells}
<D>__{ellie, you don't have the votes to block this, or even push the nomination to a second ballot.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(ignores him)}
<D>__{even running against this cut and fold vice president, with his party's record of abysmal failure at home and abroad, arthur is still unelectable without help.}
<P>__{(cold, hard logic:)}
<D>__{consider. the governor is a corn belt candidate who scratch and sniff looks and smells alot like the kind of liberal labor intellectual dukakis was, but without, thank god, the helmet.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{assume our intrepid arthur can carry the northeast, plus his home ground, and california. we're still dead in the south, and southwest, where they win by landslides. the mid central is a toss up. tom jordan actually becomes a liability in florida because of his castro appeasement profile, and in the carolinas, where he fumbles the military vote over his "terrorism isn't a war it's a social disease" nonsense.}
<A>__{the room is surreally silent. ellie spins and moves like a televangelist, preaching to the frightened faithful.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{you know this. your own polls and surveys back me up.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're counting on jordan to help you get the black vote, women, college kids my gut instinct says he won't and arthur holding the center where he's soft at best. and who's to say the president won't throw troops into another third world skirmish, pushing his sidekick's approval ratings up into the eighties again, and the campaign off the front pages?}

<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{america is facing the greatest test of its history, gentlemen. not just from terrorist organizations both outside and within our borders, but from covert alliances of disaffected nations so terrified of winding up on our shit list they believe the only way to protect themselves is to hit us with everything they can find before we get around to them. am i the only one in this room paying attention to the nsa reports? we are on the brink of nuclear cataclysm, on our own soil, while our policies remain shackled by jordan style one worlders who insist that human beings are essentially good ... and that power is something shameful, and evil.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{make no mistake, the people of this great country are frightened. they know what's coming. they can feel it. and we can shovel them the same old shit and call it sugar, or arm them, with a young, vibrant, populist congressman, a war hero with heart forged by enemy fire, in the desert, in the dark, when american lives hung in the balance.}
