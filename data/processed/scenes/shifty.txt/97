<L>__{exterior back streets. day}
<A>__{chris runs, suddenly shifty overtakes. chris is fast but shifty's like a whippet.}
<C>__{shifty}
<D>__{follow me.}
<A>__{shifty swerves down a side lane, chris follows.}
<L>__{exterior alleyway. day}
<A>__{malik's legging it down an alleyway, he throws the bag over a wall and goes over after it, he vaults, landing knee deep in a shitty garden pond.}
<C>__{malik}
<D>__{fuck.}
<L>__{exterior side street. day}
<A>__{shifty and chris sprint, the police close behind.}
<C>__{shifty}
<D>__{this is bollocks.}
<A>__{shifty vaults a brick wall, chris follows. the drop on the other side is far deeper than expected, they hit the floor hard. suddenly they see something that grabs their attention.}
<L>__{exterior cycle track. day}
<A>__{shifty and chris come swerving around the corner on the crappest kids' bikes you've ever seen. shifty's knees are near his chin, and chris' bike is pink with a fairy flag whipping off the back.}
<B>__{the camera rides parallel with them as they hurtle along the cycle track.}
<A>__{it's not perfect but it's better than running. shifty starts cracking up laughing. chris' face looks a little more serious, however. he doesn't find this all quite as funny as shifty.}
