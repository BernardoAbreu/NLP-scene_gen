<L>__{exterior graveyard close on "mechanical bronze"}
<A>__{over the tinkling sound of the music box, the bear and maiden perform their ritual as the camera pulls back revealing the gravestone decorated with the worn filmy lace undergarments of another era. they flutter in the soft wind and amber light of a summer afternoon, strangely beautiful against the mossy granite marked "unknown." somehow these rotting women's underthings have the dignity of a sacred tapestry draping an altar.}
<C>__{old lady's voice}
<D>__{...you terrible bear... so impatient... tearing something so beautiful...}
<A>__{the angle widens and we see nina, now made up to look wrinkled and gray, tragically old, her eyes moist as she kneels beside the grave.}
<C>__{old lady }
<P>__{(sudden deep sincerity)}
<D>__{why do i lie? i couldn't wait either. i think both of us are bears.}
<P>__{(a soft nostalgic smile)}
<D>__{go, young maiden, you'll be late for your piano lesson.}
<A>__{an elegantly dressed caribinerri (italian policeman) appears.}
<C>__{caribinerri}
<D>__{signora...signora...}
<C>__{old lady }
<D>__{i'm almost finished.}
<C>__{caribinerri}
<D>__{signora. this desecration... some flowers perhaps...would be permitted.}
<C>__{old lady }
<D>__{but, we want these.}
<C>__{caribinerri}
<D>__{please, signora. it's not right. the grave is unmarked.}
<C>__{old lady }
<D>__{ask the driver how many graves we visited today. i could have chosen five hours ago. i came here and my soul said, "oh yes." i know that is hard to believe...}
<C>__{caribinerri}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{anything is possible, signora.}
<P>__{(tries urging her to her feet)}
<D>__{now, you must permit me to escort you to your car.}
<C>__{old lady }
<D>__{as soon as i am gone, you will take everything away.}
<C>__{caribinerri}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{old lady }
<P>__{(tears streaming down her face)}
<D>__{you will, and i can't stop you, and it's wrong. we loved each other... where else should these go?}
<A>__{the unexpected sound of laughter makes her turn to see a small group of people who've gathered beside their parked cars watching.}
<C>__{old lady }
<D>__{yes, i know i'm ridiculous, but you laugh without knowing anything. you would buy a plastic wreath for a man of such importance.}
<A>__{she pulls free of the caribinerri and, trying to kneel down, stumbles and falls. now, like some confused child, she searches among the garments. taking a scroll from a wooden box, she shakes it at them like a schoolteacher would a ruler.}
<C>__{old lady }
<D>__{president wilson...from the president of the united states...for heroism. to me for sheltering him...}
<P>__{(smiling to herself)}
<D>__{how silly. i 'sheltered' him to be with him. he was my beloved...where is it?...oh, here, did you see this?}
<A>__{she now holds up a fist from which dangles a swastika on a sash.}
<C>__{old lady }
<D>__{given to me by adolf hitler...for our son. our son...}
<A>__{her voice suddenly fierce with the pain of that memory.}
<C>__{old lady }
<D>__{...our son!!!}
<P>__{(then, with simple reverence)}
<D>__{...a thousand years of peace...is what he said. that would be very nice.}
<A>__{the caribinerri, spellbound, has taken a backward step, bumping into a reflector, which now teeters and falls into the scene, knocking off his hat, barely missing the old lady and crashing across the grave and shattering all illusion. the caribinerri stands there with his eyes closed and his fists clenched, wishing he were in the grave. nina stands in speechless horror.}
