<L>__{interior garage pre dawn}
<A>__{the duesenberg stands silhouetted in the darkness, light glinting dimly off it like the gleam from fine wood of a splendid coffin waiting in the slumber room before services begin. behind it, a side door of the garage opens. but it is not visitors coming to pay their last respects, it is cameron and nina. he is wearing burt's clothes. nina moves quickly to a white convertible as cameron crosses to the big overhead garage doors and hits the electric switch. nothing happens. he flips another switch and harsh overhead lights illuminate the reality of the garage. nina has started the convertible, as cameron tries to lift the garage door handles.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{how the hell d'ya open this thing?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{sorry, folks, it's locked.}
<A>__{nina gasps. cameron whirls towards the voice. a cop with a big flashlight stands in the open doorway peering in at them.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{we know it's locked. would you open up for us?}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{can't...not 'til seven o'clock. mr. cross's orders.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(the actress)}
<D>__{i'm sure mr. cross will understand when you tell him that miss franklin had a sudden desire for swedish pancakes for breakfast and this gentleman had a sudden desire to keep me company...i'm nina franklin, the star of the film.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{pancake house don't open 'til eight.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{that's all right, we'll find some place.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{town's closed up pretty tight this time of night.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{then we'll drive to cape long.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{ya'll never get through the roadblocks.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{chief's orders. mr. cross didn't want any members of the company leavin' town tonight. guess he wanted everybody good and rested for the last day.}
<P>__{(he grins)}
<D>__{figure it's no secret about the chief hopin' this is the last day...}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(fiercely)}
<D>__{are you telling me that if i decide to take a drive at any time of the day or night or whenever i damn please, i need mr. cross's permission? mr. cross does not control me or anyone else, including this gentleman and he does not control the public roads!}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{no, but the police do. i will wake mr. cross up and ask him if you want, but it's an awful hour. should be somebody in the hotel kitchen by now. i will get 'em to rustle somethin' up for you. maybe not pancakes, but eggs, if you want it.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i think the lady had her heart set on pancakes, but thanks.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{okay. you change your mind, call... i will be around.}
<A>__{he leaves. the officer is gone and so is their plan. they're in limbo...people in a waiting room whose flight has been cancelled.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i can't believe it...he knows. the son of a bitch knows whatever i'm thinking. i'm beginning to feel like something that sam wrote! i'm not real. i'm some jerk american flyer from world war i who has to go over a bridge and die because the goddamn script says so! it's crazy...i'm trapped in his goddamn story. if somebody lost that page, i'd be fine. if he crossed it out and wrote something else like "at the last moment, he veers the big car from the railing then goes speeding on to live happy ever after..."}
<P>__{(he looks at the}
<D>__{duesenberg appraisingly, then grins as a plan}
<P>__{starts to form)}
<D>__{...how about that?! empty road, me out there all alone, the crew 'way back, breathless as i approach the bridge. and then..."hey, what happened?!" a fucking rewrite's what happened! i will have a fifteen minute jump on them before they figure out they're shooting a new version!}
<A>__{nina has come to life, her eyes aglow like a shrewd little girl who's already decided how the fairy tale will end!}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{...and what about the love story? what happens to the austrian girl? people will leave the movie feeling terrible...i know! she goes with him!}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{nina has walked around to the back of the duesenberg and opens the}
<B>__{trunk.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{in here.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(cautiously)}
<D>__{not bad. but, i think they arrange to meet later...like in a greyhound bus station a couple of towns away.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{no...look...}
<P>__{(she climbs in)}
<D>__{see how big it is? comfortable, too...honestly, honey, it's a better ending.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{nina, get out of the trunk.}
<A>__{the pretending has ended.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{and what happens in the morning? do i show up on the set in my little pink pinafore and say, "hi, eli. where's my hug and kiss...?" how do i do that now?}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(sternly)}
<D>__{...get out of the trunk.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{...or should i trot up to my room to catch a couple of winks and cuddle up with a dozen sleeping pills?}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{it's my nightmare...stay out! this isn't the time to solve your neurotic problems! i'm trying to stay alive!}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(shouting back)}
<D>__{so am i. and i never claimed not to have "neurotic problems!"}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{oh, for christ's sake...}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{...they come with the body! it's all one. a package deal!}
<A>__{the shouting ends...and in despairing silence, voices of approaching workmen are heard, grumbling that the coffee's late.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(urgent whisper)}
<D>__{nina, please, there's somebody coming. get out of the trunk...}
<A>__{as we glimpse the workmen in the doorway, she reaches up, grabs the inside of the trunk lid and pulls it down, disappearing from sight, as the trunk slams shut.}
