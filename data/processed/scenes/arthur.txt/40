<A>__{a very old apple mac sits on a cluttered desk. ralph is in his chair, eating popeye's chicken n' biscuits, watching csi on an old tv with a tiny satellite dish on top.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{when are we getting cable?}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{we have satellite.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{honey, that's some bullshit aerial from the 99 cent store!}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{it's a satellite dish!}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{i read the box! it said `no satellite fees to pay because does not receive satellite signals!' that's like saying `hey eat this plate of broken glass! it won't make you fat. 'cause it's glass!'}
<A>__{naomi comes in, looking absolutely beautiful. she checks her hair in the mirror.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{it's better than nothing.}
<A>__{ralph unplugs the dish. the picture improves.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{no it ain't. honey, i love you, but you're even cheaper than your mom. and she bought food from yard sales.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{i miss her too, daddy. but now she's gone and if i'm going to keep you in grits and oprah the rest of your life, you live by my rules.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{but you live like you're preparing for a war. and you earn a decent salary.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{so? i want to know i can look after you.}
<C>__{ralph}

<A>__{on csi, a female body is being unearthed.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{yeah and i bet that girl said the same about her date. honey, stay home. i don't want you ending up like that poor girl.}
