<A>__{camera pulls back, and we hear the sound of the wedding march. people are crowded into the rooms: family, friends, neighbors. there is a din of conversation. mary and george appear at the top of the stairs in traveling clothes, with mrs. hatch, red eyed, behind them. mary throws her bouquet, which is caught by violet bick. as they come out onto the porch, we see that it is raining. nevertheless, cousin eustace has his camera equipment set up and is taking pictures of the group. george and mary dodge through the rain and a shower of rice and get into ernie's taxicab, which pulls away from the curb.}
