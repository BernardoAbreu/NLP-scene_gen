<A>__{fletcher is asleep in his bed. frank waits as rachel glances in. then she moves away. opening the door to her room, she steps back, allowing him to enter ahead.}
<L>__{interior rachel's room night}
<A>__{frank moves quickly into the room, checking the window and french door. rachel waits silently by the door. all is clear. he steps back to the door. as he approaches her she begins to tremble. he gently reaches out and takes her in his arms. slowly holding her he leads her to bed, moving aside some of rachel's dolls, laid out on the pillows. her hands go automatically to her dress but they are shaking so badly she cannot undo it. frank gently does it for her. she willingly allows him to undress her and not a word is spoken between them. as she sits naked still trembling, he pulls down the covers and guides her gently into bed. as he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of his hand. he looks down, stroking her forehead like a child's.}
