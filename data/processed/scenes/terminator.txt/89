<A>__{music booms and masses of leotarded cellulite sway in close f.g. as camera dollies along a row of panting, stretching women. in deep b.g. sarah slips in through the door and waits against the wall while the human dynamo, ginger ventura, leads the class energetically. ginger, sarah's roommate, is a party stopper. red haired, athletic, sensuous. she's pretty enough when still, but stunning in motion. and she's in motion. ginger yells commands and cheerfully dives into contortions to the beat of a motown favorite. marco, a handsome, well defined guy wearing a tight staff t shirt, strolls up for a drink at the water fountain next to sarah.}

<D>__{you're wasting your time, kiddo. let's go.}
