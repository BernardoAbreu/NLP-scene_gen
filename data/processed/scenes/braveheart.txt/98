<L>__{exterior a barn in the scottish countryside day}
<A>__{hauntingly similar to the one in wallace's childhood. as he sits on his horse and looks at the place, surmounted by a white flag of truce, it gives him a chill. but in full view of the barn, he hands hamish his sword and rides forward.}
<B>__{inside the barn}
<A>__{are the assassins, killing knives ready.}
<C>__{chief assassin}
<D>__{it's william wallace, sure! and... he's given up his sword! be ready!}
<A>__{they position themselves at every entrance.}
<B>__{outside the barn}
<A>__{wallace reaches the barn, dismounts, and moves toward the door. but suddenly, instead of entering, he grabs the heavy bar and seals the door! at this motion, scots spring from the woods in all directions. the assassins inside realize the ambush is being turned on them, but it's too late; they hear the entrance being sealed from the outside. more scots, led by stephen, scramble up from hiding, place tinder dry brush and pitch against the barn, and set it on fire. in moments the entire barn is blazing. the scots stand back and watch the barn burn, their faces lit by the flames. after awhile, there are no more screams from inside.}
