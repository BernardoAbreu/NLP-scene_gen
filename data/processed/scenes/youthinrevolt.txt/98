<L>__{interior nick's room night}
<A>__{nick let's out a yelp of pain as lance brings a broken tree limb against his bare bottom. whack! whack! whack!}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{i don't scream much. i am making a painful sacrifice for the woman of my dreams. my suffering possesses a beauty which elevates it above this sordid scene.}
<A>__{with the final blow the tree limb cracks in half. nick looks over his shoulder.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{are you through?}
<A>__{lance looks around the room. picks up an umbrella and considers it in his hand. nick hangs his head.}
