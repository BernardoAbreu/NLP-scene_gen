<A>__{ryan sees simon cowell mouth the words "stupid cow" in synch with the conversation. bingo! ryan floors the rent a cop car ahead of the cadillac and pulls a 90 degree turn at an intersection; cutting cowell off! screeeech! cowell, trying to avoid a collision, slams on the brakes, causing the cadillac to skid twenty feet. ryan jumps out of the rent a cop car he's left in the middle or the intersection and runs over to the cadillac, banging on the window with the .38 special. cowell practically jumps out of his skin at the sight of the gun and the kid with the crazy look in his eyes.}

<D>__{ryan?! i'm here!}
<A>__{her voice says she can't believe her ears. relieved, ryan jumps in the cadillac xlr and tosses his phone on the passenger seat, next to a laptop computer. guns the engine and stomps the gas. as he passes the ruins of his rent a cop car, he slows just enough to open the cadillac's door and snatch up his bag of verizon goodies laying on the pavement then peels away. practically frothing at the mouth, simon cowell chases after on foot, cursing as his beautiful new cadillac disappears in the distance }
