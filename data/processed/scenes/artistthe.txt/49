<D>__{in the street, at the entrance to a movie theater, george sees a large "beauty spot" film poster. the poster shows peppy close up, wearing a magnificent and jauntily positioned chapka over one eye. she is incredibly stylish but in no way vampish, more the image of a young comedy debut... george looks at her, peppy seems to be smiling at him. he smiles back. then his smile becomes strained. he's noticed something. the two theater employees are sticking a banner over the poster that reveals the release date of beauty spot it's also october 25th.}
