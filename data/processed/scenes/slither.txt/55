<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant?}
<A>__{again, no one's here. she sees a potted flower on the counter. a green inchworm is crawling up the stem, little by little. she stares at it, as if it's a portent. she hears a moan, coming from upstairs.}

<A>__{starla moves slowly into this dark room, looking for her husband. it seems no one is here.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant, where are y ?}
<A>__{starla turns, when grant pops into frame. starla, startled, screams. grant is sick and trembling. but, worse, he's been transforming. there are small pustules all over his face.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant. oh my god. what happened to your ?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{heh. it ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. dr. carl was just here. i had a reaction to a bee sting. he gave me a prescription. said i should be fine, in a couple days.}
<A>__{starla stares at him, mute and horrified.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{don't look at me like that, baby. please? i'm gonna go get my... prescription filled.}
<A>__{grant grabs his keys off the dresser, puts them in his pocket, trying to pretend he doesn't hurt.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{i will get if for you.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{no! no. heh. i will be right back.}
<A>__{he moves outside the door, leaving starla, shell shocked.}
