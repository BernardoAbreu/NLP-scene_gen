<A>__{pandemonium. the confederates are in complete disarray. the federals pour forwards across no mans land, through the peaceful oasis of trees, roaring the roar of attack. they flood towards the crater, hundreds of them, charging into a dense and impenetrable wall of smoke. then they're inside the great gash of crater and can't get out again, arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud. the confederates regroup. orders are yelled. chaos developing into battle. the confederates begin firing into the crater. guns and mortar wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death trap. inman gets to his feet. oakley with him, and rushes through the smoke to the pit, emptying his lemats into the crater. later: a black regiment from the union join the attack. bodies falling on bodies as the federals charge in and pack their comrades even tighter. the confederates make a pincer movement outside the crater, forcing all the federals in. it's medieval. no escape. the confederates jump into the pit to engage the federals. hand to hand fighting. too close for rifles, just bayonets, and guns swung like clubs and inman sliding down into that hell, tiring the nine rounds, then the shotgun charge, which does a terrible damage. primitive. unutterable carnage. men killing each other in embraces, soldier crushed against soldier, desperate to survive, to kill, to live. an oozing layer cake of bodies, dead and frantically alive, drowning in slick. young oakley loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case, clubbing his opponent, then slips onto him and is stuck with a bayonet, the pain of which makes him squeal. inman goes at it. he's a warrior, punching and stabbing and firing. a coldly efficient killer. he's grabbed from behind and crushed, a hand gouging at his face, an almighty struggle. he falls and lands on top of oakley, and he and his federal opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their pillow. the slaughter continues over and around them, the sound, the sound of hell and madness. the boy has his arm around inman, like lovers. later: the confederates run after the retreating union soldiers, firing, cavalry riding them down. inman stands, the boy's blood all over him, exhausted and appalled. the crater, behind him, an abattoir of men. the victors are yelling, pumped mad with adrenaline. butcher comes alongside inman.}

<A>__{a wounded black soldier sits up as butcher celebrates. butcher runs over, but can't find a charge for his musket. he looks around in the stack of corpses, pulling out weapons, tries one: not loaded, throws it down, tries another: not loaded. the wounded man can't get up, tries to drag himself like a crab away from butcher. inman yells at him, appalled.}
