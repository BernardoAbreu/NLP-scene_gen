<ACTION>__{INSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Fitzgerald.   His work.   His life.}
<DIAL>__{HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Fitzgerald was one of the truly great American writers of the 20th century. Tender is the Night. The Last Tycoon. This Side of Paradise. And, of course, my favorite, The Great Gatsby. But Fitzgerald ended up out here. Writing movies that never got made. Drinking too much. Alienating people. Losing his way.}

<ACTION>__{Henry yanks a MAGNETIC SIGN out of the back seat and slaps it on the outside of the driver's door: PIZZA STARZ. One last glance at the fabled apartment complex.}

<LOC>__{INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The man (40's) and woman (30's) sit on the couch in their tastefully-decorated San Fernando Valley home. Expensive taste in clothes. Her cleavage a bit too obvious.

<DIAL>__{The whole group. Not just us, right? Not that it should be just about us...}
<ACTION>__{Nervous laugh.}
<CHAR>__{ALAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<ACTION>__{They look at each other: A documentary? They try to mask their disappointment.}
<CHAR>__{COLETTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So this is going to be like--like what I saw the other night on cable? About bees mating.}

<DIAL>__{...consumed totally, completely, absolutely, by endless thoughts of Yuri fondling her breast, his other hand groping her womanhood, knowing...}
<ACTION>__{They sit around the dining room table. Colette, convinced she's the next Amy Tan, reads aloud from her TYPED PAGES. The others all have copies in front of them. We recognize Henry, the frog waiting to become a prince, making copious notes and Alan, oh-so-proud, hanging on every word. Beaming. Three others round out the group: Younger MAN (early 30s). Unshaven. Always thinks he's the coolest guy in any room. Can't avoid glances at the camera. CAPTION: WILLIAM BRUCE The OLDEST MEMBER of the group (over 60) sits with his arms folded as he listens, shifting in his chair. Captain Grumpy. CAPTION: JOHN K. BUTZIN Finally, the young (mid-to-late 20s), angelic, WOMAN listening intently, the one who probably stopped to rescue a cat on her way here. CAPTION: HANNAH RINALDI}
<CHAR>__{COLETTE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{...Any second that she might explode, her chastity spraying across the ceiling...Spraying across the ceiling like passionate graffiti. Natasha never thought such a moment possible. "Have I satisfied you, Natasha?" Yuri had inquired after their fourth round of vodka-soaked lovemaking. "Nyet, Not yet," Natasha stated, exhausted, but grateful.}
<ACTION>__{Awkward silence around the table as Colette removes her reading glasses and waits. Alan clears his throat, looking cheerful.}

<DIAL>__{Well?   Comments?}
<LOC>__{INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Henry's sparse studio apartment. Minimal furniture. His laptop is set up on an old door, stretched across some blue plastic crates. There are BOOKS piled everywhere. All sorts of books. And PAPER -- pieces of paper, including letters and cards and printed emails, dozens of them, are taped throughout the small apartment. We are introduced to Henry the writer: pondering over his battered laptop, pacing up and down the floor, checking his nearly empty refrigerator, stretched out on his Goodwill couch, watching TV. Finally, inspiration. Henry rushes to his desk and taps out a sentence or two on his computer, feeling proud for his accomplishment.}
<CHAR>__{HENRY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{I graduated from the University of Illinois. English major. Taught high school for a couple years, but hated it. Moved out here to be a writer.}
<LOC>__{EXT. HOUSE - DAY/NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{As Henry's voice over continues, we see him in uniform with pizza in hand at the front door of a house. Rings doorbell.}
<CHAR>__{HENRY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{I work two jobs. Delivering pizzas and cleaning carpets. Good jobs for a writer.}
<LOC>__{INT. HOUSE - DAY/NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Henry cleaning the carpets as the heavily-tattooed MOTORCYCLE DUDE points to a dirty spot: Over here.}
<CHAR>__{HENRY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{You meet lots of interesting people.}
<LOC>__{INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Henry points to the letters on the wall. C.U. picks up on phrases like "We regret to inform you," or "Sorry, but this story isn't right for us," or "The Baxter Agency currently isn't accepting new clients."}
<CHAR>__{HENRY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{I have two unpublished novels. Working on my third, Pizza to Go. These are my rejection letters. Rejected by agents. Rejected by publishers. When you think about it, it's pretty amazing how many ways people can reject you.}
<LOC>__{INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Henry, John, Alan, Colette, Hannah, and William sit around the table. Impressive buffet of cold cuts, cheeses, and shrimp has been set out.}

<DIAL>__{Our writing group meets every Tuesday night. Mostly at Alan and Colette's. Sometimes we rotate.}
<ACTION>__{John helps himself to some shrimp.   Then helps himself to some more.}

<CHAR>__{JOHN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{You're still going to have to explain why this Natasha dame goes AWOL on her husband. Still kinda iffy to me.}
<ACTION>__{Another glance at the camera: Did you get that?}
<CHAR>__{ALAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I was bothered by that, too. Why would Natasha betray a reliable, dependable husband for a washed-up young punk?}
<ACTION>__{All eyes on Colette.    She shifts in her chair.   Uncomfortable.}
<CHAR>__{COLETTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh.   Well...um...um...}
<ACTION>__{An uneasy silence. Colette is blocked--nowhere to go creatively. Her face tightens up. Bites her lip.}
<CHAR>__{COLETTE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Oh God. I've been rewriting and rewriting and rewriting and--}
<CHAR>__{ALAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Poodles.     It's OK.}
<CHAR>__{COLETTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No. It's not OK. I still can't explain Natasha's motive. What's the use? I'm not a writer.}
<ACTION>__{William to the rescue.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Whoa. Whoa. Time out. The dude's good in bed. Trust me, that's all the motive she needs.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Roger that. Torpedo Chapter Three. Blow it up. Get the focus back on this broad--Natasha.}
<CHAR>__{HENRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{--Yes. I was thinking the same thing.}
<CHAR>__{HANNAH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Make it clear that Natasha wants to be closer...}
<ACTION>__{Colette makes notes furiously, nodding in agreement.}
<CHAR>__{HENRY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Writing can be such a solitary existence, so it's good to have this outlet where you can meet other writers and exchange ideas. Here it really is all for one and one for all.}
<LOC>__{INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Later that evening.    Meeting is over. Alan, Colette, Hannah, Henry, William, and John are all standing up now. William stretches. John reaches for more shrimp. Friendly banter. Laughter.}
<CHAR>__{COLETTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who wants coffee?}
<ACTION>__{Everybody does.    William taps Henry on the shoulder.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{What do you think? On or off? Do they make me look smarter? I need a new pair.}
<ACTION>__{She takes the glasses off. Puts them back on. Off again. Debating. Hannah prepares herself with a series of quick breaths and waves her hands in the air. Then she stares directly into the camera.}

<DIAL>__{Hi. I'm originally from Prescott, Arizona. Followed my mom out here about four years ago. That's her back there.}

<CHAR>__{WILLIAM } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Just kidding. I'm actually 28. Hometown is Modesto, California, A sprawling junk heap of a town without a soul. Why did I come to LA? Um, because I knew you were here and that you'd loan me a hundred bucks if I needed it. Right?}
<ACTION>__{WAITRESS #1 refills his coffee cup. Her reward is that smile.}

<ACTION>__{He waves to WAITRESS #1.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{I like the people in the group. But they can't write worth shit. But, man, Hannah is something. She's the only reason I keep going. Not because I'm learning anything. Hell, no. I just think she's hot.}

All those nitty-gritty technical details. Now that's writing! John K. Butzin has one agent very interested in Roaring Lion. And a publisher up in Oxnard is looking at it as we speak. Plus a certain cousin's best friend has a neighbor who has an in with Clint Eastwood, so Hollywood might be calling soon.
