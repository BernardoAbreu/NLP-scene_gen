<L>__{exterior the lawn continuous on our three heroes}
<A>__{as they crunch their way non too stealthily across the backyard.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{don't crunch the leaves.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{raja}

<C>__{furious}
<D>__{wait.}
<P>__{(they all stop.)}
<D>__{i hear something.}
<A>__{they all listen; there is a low rushing sound... it is the sound of water rushing through pipes. suddenly, the lawn sprinklers all pop up... and our heroes get drenched. they duck off the lawn, behind the cover of a large tree.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{i'm soaked.}
<P>__{(sneezes)}
<D>__{oh great.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{shhh.}
<C>__{shoveler}

<C>__{raja}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{furious sees a pair of french doors, off a small patio. one of the doors is slightiy open.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{they start sneaking toward it, but as they cross the patio... they trip the automatic security lighting, and suddenly find themselves bathed in light.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<A>__{as our heroes look around as a dozen disco boys, armed with pipes, chains, brass knuckles, step into the light and encircle them... the french doors open and tony p steps out.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{oh i'm sorry. we must have the wrong house.}
<C>__{tony p}
<D>__{you sure do.}
<A>__{the disco boys attack. the raja is instantly clubbed down. the shoveler deflects only a blow or two with his shovel before he goes down, too... these guys are not the red eyes. only furious holds his own. he grabs a pipe away from one of them and swings fiercely, keeping the others off. suddenly, the disco boys pull back. furious doesn't know why, until he turns and sees... casanova, standing right behind him, smiling.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{hi there.}
<A>__{with a cat like move casanova slashes his gold chain viciously and repeatedly across furious' face. furious, stunned with pain, lunges at casanova, who neatly steps aside, then catches him with a fast combination of spinning disco kicks. finally he lassos the chain around furious' neck, and pulls it tight, strangling him. on the disco boys, watching, snapping their fingers with admiration... casanova releases furious, who slumps to the ground. casanova steps away, and the disco boys gather around furious and kick him viciously... as casanova and tony p watch, amused, chuckling.}

<C>__{casanova}
<P>__{(completely disdainful)}
