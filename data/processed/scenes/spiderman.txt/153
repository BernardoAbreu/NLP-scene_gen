<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{cops, firemen, press, the works. the crowd gasps. camera strobes pop as the last car crashes to the sidewalk. we hold several beats on the incredible rubble. then, a webbed hand. spider man groggily pulls himself from the wreckage.}
<C>__{cop }
<D>__{put your hands up, spider man. spider man you're making a big mistake.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{and you're looking at twenty years.}
<A>__{spider man shoots a wad of web goo onto the cop's gun and leaps up onto the luxury condo... and swings up out of the frame. the cop aims and shoots. the bullet makes a thwump noise. the web goo stretches out about three feet and falls limp.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{what the hell!}
