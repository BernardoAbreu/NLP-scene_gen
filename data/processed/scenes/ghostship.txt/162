<A>__{a boot punches through a rotten wood hull.}
<C>__{murphy }
<D>__{that just about says it all.}
<A>__{greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards above the deck.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{rotten stem to stern. guess you couldn't expect much else.}
<A>__{greer jumps down as murphy, dodge, and epps look on.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{we ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{the coast guard has our last position. they'll send somebody out soon enough. a ship this size you can't exactly miss.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{let 'em ask. this ship's legally ours now.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{when they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.}
<A>__{dodge turns to see greer. a beat.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{the turbine blew.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?}
<A>__{a beat. dodge takes a swing at greer.}
<C>__{murphy}
<P>__{(grabbing dodge)}
<D>__{easy, easy.}
<A>__{murphy holds on to dodge as he will have none of it.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{gettin' a little hot under the collar, i'd say.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{must be a little too the truth, eh dodge?}
<A>__{dodge jumps forward again, but murphy hangs on.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i said, shut the hell up.}
<A>__{murphy shoves dodge back.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{both of you. i don't want to hear it again.}
<A>__{a beat as greer and murphy hold there.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{so just stow it. you understand?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{we don't need this right now.}
