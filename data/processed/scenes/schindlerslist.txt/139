<L>__{exterior plaszow day}
<A>__{goeth gallops around his great domain holding himself high in the saddle. but everywhere he looks, it seems, he's confronted with stoop shouldered sloth. he forces himself to smile benevolently.}
<L>__{interior goeth's villa day}
<A>__{goeth comes into his bedroom sweating from his ride. a worker with a pail and cloth appears in the bathroom doorway. more to the floor }
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{i have to report, sir, i've been unable to remove the stains from your bathtub.}
<A>__{goeth steps past him to take a look. the worker is almost shaking, he's so terrified of the violent reprisal he expects to receive.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{what are you using?}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{soap, sir.}
<C>__{goeth}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{soap? not lye?}
<A>__{the worker hasn't a defense for himself. goeth's hand drifts down as if by instinct to the gun in his holster. he stares at the worker. he so wants to shoot him he can hardly stand it, right here, right in the bathroom, put some more stains on the porcelain. he takes a deep breath to calm himself. then gestures grandly.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{go ahead, go on, leave. i pardon you.}
<A>__{the worker hurries out with his pail and cloth. goeth just stands there for several moments trying to feel the power of emperors he's supposed to be feeling. but he doesn't feel it. all he feels is stupid.}
