<L>__{interior hotel paraiso room night}
<A>__{electra is still at the table, staring at the diagrams, in another world. rath pours a glass of bourbon and sets it in front of her.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{this has been the longest day of my life.}
<A>__{rath nods, pouring himself a drink. electra looks at the drink, downs the whole glass. he refills it.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{do you have ulcers?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i think i got one today.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{five million dollars will buy a lot of rolaids.}
<A>__{she smiles. they both gulp down their drinks and he fills them again.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{what do you suppose he's doing now?}
<A>__{rath shrugs. he is no longer looking at her; staring at the board, moving his mind into the chess game. she watches him and then begins to study it with him, the way a child does, almost imitating him. she does not want to be left alone right now. she reaches over and moves a white knight. he blinks. his eyes shifting, sorting the possibilities. he picks a bishop and counters. after another sequence, he takes her bishop and she takes his knight.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{why did you trade a bishop for a knight?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i hate bishops. they're useless. i like knights.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{they're worth less points.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{there is no point in arguing. as they continue to play, we begin to hear in the distance, the couple in the adjoining suite making very vigorous love. electra watches rath to see if he hears them. he shows no sign of it, concentrating on the game.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{do you hear them?}
<A>__{he looks up.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{listen.}
<A>__{he hears it. not interested.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{did you think they were newlyweds?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i didn't notice them.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{when i first saw them i thought they were married.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{how do you know they're not?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i went into their room this afternoon.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{it was no big deal. i saw them leave, i went in.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{jesus, if someone had }
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{nobody ever sees me.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{why in the hell would you take that chance?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them. i wanted to, so i did.}
<A>__{rath shakes his head. in the b.g., the woman is almost}
<B>__{screaming.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{she is married, but not to him. another man, much older. she has four kids. the young guy works for her. and i think she likes kinky sex.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{isn't it interesting though? i mean, look at us, in this room. or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market. i mean, we look like just another couple. but what are we? doesn't it seem so crazy?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{it's always been that way. the world has always functioned on two levels.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i know. it makes me crazy.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i don't know. when i was in college, i was forced to go to a psychiatrist because i was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{and you were drilling these holes...?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{so i could watch the girl that lived under me.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{he told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self preservation.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{did he explain how this happened?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{he believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl. i watched my parents have this big fight, really big. i thought my mother was going to kill my father. then they went into their room and made up. and i watched them make love through the keyhole.}
<A>__{the woman screams a final time in climax. electra moves her queen, taking his other knight.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{that's a ridiculous move.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{because, i will take it.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i'm playing white, remember. you can't tell me which pieces to move. it doesn't work that way.}
<A>__{he shrugs and takes her queen, the game continuing.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{can i ask you something?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i'm sure you will.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{am i attractive?}
<A>__{this gets his attention.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{are you attracted to me?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{why? i don't know.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{both.}
<A>__{a good answer. electra smiles.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i didn't want to complicate the situation.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{attraction is a complication?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{it can be.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{it happened to you before?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{who was she?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{someone like me, like you. a pro.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{what happened to her?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{she was taken.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{did you }
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no. i tried to stop it. i couldn't.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{was she the only one?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{after her, i realized that to survive i had to live without... it's dangerous to let things become complicated.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{is this becoming complicated?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i'm not sure that i care anymore.}
<A>__{he looks up from the game.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{were you attracted to me right away?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{when did it start?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{honestly?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{when i gave you my gun and you almost shot me.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{maybe you should see a psychiatrist.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{that doesn't sound normal.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i'm not normal.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i know. that's why i'm attracted to you. i mean, you make me nervous. you're intimidating. maybe it's my curiosity self preservation thing, but all i can really think about right now is kissing you.}
<A>__{they rise up from the table, together, knocking over the chess game. the pieces fall to the floor. they grab at each other, kissing, both of them hungry, aggressive. they tear at each other's clothes and at their own clothes; it has a very awkward sense to it, as they become naked in front of each other. there is nothing smooth or fluid about it, which makes it seem very real. he takes her, lifting her onto the table. she scoots and wiggles back, the chess pieces falling out of the way. she opens her legs and he moves in between them.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i wanted to tell you }
<A>__{her breath rushes out, then back in.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{my real name is anna.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{martin.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{martin.}
<A>__{her legs wrap up around his hips and he pushes deeper into her.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{nice to meet you, martin.}
