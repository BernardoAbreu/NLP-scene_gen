<ACTION>__{BABIES in bassinets, isolettes, incubators.  BABIES sleeping, BABIES blinking, BABIES cooing, BABIES chirping, BABIES squalling. It's the SQUALLING BABIES, the ones with pinched faces and tiny bunched fists, that seem to interest the TWO ANONYMOUS MEN in Military Uniforms.  (Their anonymity is assured by the angles from which they are seen; they are hands, they are feet, they are the backs of heads.) A lone NURSE watches them grimly as they make their "selections," marking the cribs of the most active, noisy BABIES with X's.}

The cage is in the middle of a gloomy windowless room surrounded by twenty TWO-YEAR-OLDS seated on folding chairs and dressed in identical gray overalls.  As the TWO-YEAR-OLDS watch the battle, amazement on their innocent faces, a date appears SUPERED over the scene...

They ought to look cute, but somehow these joyless FOUR-YEAR-OLDS look slightly sinister, all of them wearing drab uniforms and military burr-cut hair.  Again a date is SUPERED over the scene -- -- just as an AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD approaches a PASSIVE FOUR YEAR-OLD seated on the floor and kicks him. It's a harmless child's kick.  But then, as the DATE DISAPPEARS, he kicks the PASSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD again.  And again. The servo-motor in a remote video camera mounted high on the wall WHINES slightly as the camera pans to the record the action.}

SIX-YEAR-OLDS now, the boys perform in a grim room under fluorescent lights as more ANONYMOUS MEN and WOMEN in polished shoes and sharply creased military slacks cruise the aisles, observing.

This a brutal cross country run under a grim sky in bitter cold weather, but the SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS are super-fit, their faces hard and without expression, their eyes as cold as snake eyes. Except for the STRAGGLER, a lone boy who's bringing up the rear, obviously in trouble, gasping for air, struggling, struggling, struggling to keep his feet... ANGLE ON A HILL where ANONYMOUS OBSERVERS, all in military dress, watch. ANGLE ON THE STRAGGLER, unable to keep his feet, going down, gasping.  With fearful eyes, he looks toward the hill where he knows the OBSERVERS are. ANGLE ON THE PACK, sixteen SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS not looking back, even as a single SHOT rings out.  TODD doesn't even blink, just keeps running.}

<ACTION>__{Suddenly, out of nowhere, a scary mechanized pop-up target, a MILITARY FIGURE, erupts from the long grass, weapon pointing. Before the weapon can flash a laser bean, AUTOMATIC FIRE ravages the target and it disappears back into the grass.  The boys, EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLDS now, are wearing combat gear and carrying automatic weapons as they advance through a sloping field of tall grass. Different sophisticated TARGETS pop up urgently, sometimes close, sometimes far, some MOVING rapidly on tracks. The EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLDS expertly mow down menacing MILITARY FIGURES while holding their fire when ANIMAL TARGETS or UNARMED CIVILIANS and CHILDREN appear. The eighteen-year-old on point is RILEY, a muscular redhead. TODD is right behind him as a date is SUPERED over the scene... Suddenly multiple TARGETS appear, charging. BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA!  First TARGET down! RILEY, panning for the next target, holds fire, passes over two MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN, pans for a nearby SOLDIER TARGET.  But the SOLDIER TARGET zips behind the MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN, taking cover, weapon pointed at RILEY. For half a second RILEY hesitates! BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA!  TODD blazes away, mercilessly blowing away the MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN TARGET and the SOLDIER TARGET.}

Wearing dripping ponchos, CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK are looking the robot-like monsters over like so much meat, while a bright- eyed blond colonel about thirty, named MEKUM, stands proudly by, glowing with satisfaction. The vast interior is so large that in spite of clusters of stacked crates, part of a dismantled spaceship, a rusty earthmover, numerous large pieces of machinery, and a whole arrangement of exercise gear, the place has huge open spaces and a sense of emptiness to it.

Struggling weakly to his feet, TODD staggers toward the next window.  The MUSIC is LOUDER as he approaches -- it's waltz music played on an accordion. TODD drops to his knees and peers through the next window. TODD'S POV through the second "window," another mysterious vision!  The color and movement are more subdued, but TODD is just as puzzled. What he's seeing indistinctly through the thick plexiglass is an OVERHEAD VIEW of a man and a woman gliding across the floor, moving as one, first this way, then that, in time to a WALTZ.  In the corner, another person is making a strange movement that seems to initiate the music... ANGLE ON TODD, flat on the roof.  Now that the weak breeze has given way to a deathly stillness, the mysterious (to him) MUSIC is clearly audible as TODD peers through the plexiglass at the warm scene below, as puzzled by the waltzing couple as by the pillow fights.

A strange haunting WHISTLING sound is coming from somewhere... TODD looks around at the blackness beyond the roof windows. There's nothing visible...

NATHAN totters onward. CLOSE ANGLE ON CHARTS, the same ones Church had on Christmas Eve, showing tiny dots in a vast sea of space.

Tiny NATHAN is looking up at TODD who's towering over him. TODD looks down without expression, the scarf from Jimmy Pig still wrapped around his neck. NATHAN puts his arms out to be picked up. TODD considers the outstretched arms. RILEY looks from TODD to NATHAN and back to TODD.  What's this? TODD hesitates a half second more, then leans down and picks NATHAN up in his arms, lifting the boy to his chest. RILEY looks on.  Never seen anything like it. NATHAN is close to TODD's face, looking right into it, trying a little smile, a nervous one, looking for a response. TODD hesitates, takes a breath, moves the muscles of his face. All he can produce is an awkward grimace, the distortion of a smile, almost comical. NATHAN reads the intention successfully.  His face collapses into a huge friendly grin. TODD tries again, making a clumsy sort of rubbery wince. RILEY watches.  Totally amazed. TODD turns, takes NATHAN to a porthole, puts his face up to it. NATHAN stares out at the darkness punctuated by a billion stars, a sky full of hope. As NATHAN looks out, TODD works his face again, trying for a smile the way a weak man might try to lift a heavy weight. NATHAN looks at the stars outside, TODD looks with him and suddenly TODD's face relaxes into an awkward grin, almost by accident.
