<L>__{exterior enterprise space}
<A>__{the enterprise streaks through space.}
<L>__{interior enterprise crew lounge night}
<A>__{data sits in the empty crew lounge. as always, the android's placid, neutral expression still somehow manages to convey his wonder, curiosity and idiosyncratic zest for life. picard arrives with a very old bottle of wine.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i've been saving this. chateau picard 2267. batten down the hatches...}
<A>__{he carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as:}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{they say a vintner's history is in every glass. the soil he came from. his past as well as his hopes for the future.}
<A>__{he pours two glasses of the wine, then raises his glass, a toast.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{so... to happy endings.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{to happy endings.}
<A>__{picard carefully takes a tiny sip, savors the flavor, finally swallows. enjoys it. ahhh. data mimics picard. taking a tiny sip, savoring the flavor and finally swallowing. ahhh.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{sir. i noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. i am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but i could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i understand why it would seem confusing. certain human rituals like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. these rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{and you were particularly aware of this feeling because commander riker will be leaving to assume command of the titan?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{will and deanna joining the titan. dr. crusher going to starfleet medical...}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{and this makes you "sad"?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{well. i suppose it does a bit. i'm very happy for them, of course, but i'm going to miss them. the ship will seem... incomplete without them.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{that is because you have a familiarity with them. you can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{yes. and, frankly, i envy them as well. they've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. new worlds to conquer...}
<A>__{he takes another sip of wine. a beat.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{seeing will and deanna today made me think about some of the choices i've made in my own life. devoting myself to starfleet... not marrying or having children... all the choices that led me here.}
<A>__{a beat. data thinks about it.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{the choices i made have led me here as well. this is the only home i have ever known. i cannot foresee a reason for leaving.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you never know what's over the horizon, data. before too long you'll be offered a command of your own. data looks at him; he has never really considered this.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{if i were... i believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. i would "miss you."}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{now, you make a toast.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{to new worlds...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{new worlds. yes data, brave new worlds...}
<A>__{they drink.}
