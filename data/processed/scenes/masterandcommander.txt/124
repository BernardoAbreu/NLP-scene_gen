<L>__{129. the great cabin night}
<A>__{the singing mixes with the end of a lively dinner given by jack for his officers, including a special guest, young}
<B>__{blakeney.}
<C>__{pullings}
<D>__{with your permission, sir, mr. mowett has composed a short poem in honour of our mission.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{let's hear it, mr. mowett.}
<A>__{reactions around the table, glasses re filled in anticipation. mowett stands and declaims with a number of precise airy gestures, like a conductor.}
<C>__{mowett}
<D>__{our brotherhood, some old, some new. in blood baptized, in strength renewed. in purpose unified and true. all thoughts of home forsaken. where duty leads us, there we go. nor rest nor comfort shall we know. until the unrepentant foe, is boarded sunk or taken}
<C>__{all}
<P>__{(raising their glasses)}
<D>__{aye! capital! well said! hear him, hear him! 'sunk or taken'...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{aye and when we do take her we shall give her to tom pullings as his first command. if he don't die before then. bumpers up tom}
<C>__{allen}
<P>__{(a toast)}
<D>__{'to wives and sweethearts'.}
<A>__{they raise their glasses }
<C>__{all}
<D>__{'to wives and sweethearts'.}
<C>__{pullings}
<D>__{and may they never meet.}
<A>__{amid the laughter someone bumps blakeney's stump. he winces, then puts a brave face on it}
<C>__{blakeney }
<D>__{i believe you knew nelson, sir?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{lord nelson? yes. i had the honour of serving under him at the nile.}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{mr. mowett, the bottle stands by you, sir.}
<P>__{(as the bottle moves on)}
<D>__{in fact i dined with him twice, and he spoke to me on both occasions.}
<A>__{the table goes quiet. blakeney is wide eyed, though partly from his strenuous efforts to appear sober.}
<D>__{jack (cont.) (cont'd) the first time he said to me 'may i trouble you for the salt, sir?' i have always tried to say it as close as i could the second time someone had offered him a boat cloak on a cold night and he said no, he was quite warm his zeal for his king and country kept him warm.}
<A>__{amid the general agreement 'hear him, hear him', etc. stephen is noticeably silent.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{it sounds absurd, i know, and were it another man you would cry out, "oh, what pitiful stuff" and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm, but with him you felt your heart glow.}
<C>__{mowett}
<P>__{(raising his glass)}
<D>__{to lord nelson.}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{lord nelson!}
<A>__{stephen joins on the toast, but jack knows that his friend deplores such overt patriotism and seeks to draw him back in with a joke.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you see those two weevils, doctor?}
<A>__{he points at a faint movement amongst the crumbs of a ship's biscuit.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{which would you choose?}
<A>__{the table tenses with anticipation of one of the captain's 'jokes'. stephen concentrates.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{there is not a scrap of difference. they are the same species of curculio.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{but suppose you had to choose?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{then i would choose the right hand weevil, it has a perceptible advantage in both length and breadth.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there i have you. you are completely dished. don't you know in the navy you must always choose 'the lesser of two weevils'?}
<A>__{he thunders with laughter, the rest joining in, breathless with mirth, tears of laughter streaming down their faces}
<C>__{allen}
<D>__{'pon my life. he who would pun would pick a pocket. dye not smoke it doctor?}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(poker faced)}
<D>__{sure there would be some poor thin barren minds that would catch at such a paltry clench.}
<A>__{then he too cracks a smile and joins in their laughter}
