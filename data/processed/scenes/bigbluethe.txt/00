<A>__{the image is in black and white. the sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant shadows on the sea. a little boy around 8 years old tanned from head to toe sprints along the cliffs, scrambles from one rock to another with amazing agility. in one hand, he carries a transparent plastic bag. in the other, a net bag containing flippers, mask, pants and sweater. the only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit obvious hand me downs way too big. he tugs on them as he goes, holding them up... until they slide again... as he leaps again... and pulls them up... the little boy is jacques mayol. end credits.}
