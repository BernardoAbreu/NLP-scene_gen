<L>__{interior courthouse day}
<A>__{the packed courthouse is abuzz and the elderly judge wilcox is forced to slam his gavel down...}
<C>__{judge wilcox}
<D>__{order!}
<A>__{jay sits at the defendant's table, suit impeccable, hair immaculate, game face on. theo sits beside him, scribbling notes. marie is in the front row of the gallery, surrounded by her coiffured peers. she tries to smile stoically at jay... kristen sits beside elena at the prosecution table. chad is on the stand as arlo meese, 35, the slick district attorney, steps forward.}
<C>__{d.a. meese}
<D>__{dr. borman, do your tests show that elena sandoval had sexual intercourse on the night of the 25th?}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{yes they do.}
<C>__{d.a. meese}
<D>__{do they show that it was forced?}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{yes. there was extensive bruising and tearing. we found no semen evidence. the latex abrasions point to the use of protection. this is quite common in cases of premeditated rape.}
<C>__{d.a. meese}
<D>__{and what can you tell us about miss sandoval's toxicology reports, doctor?}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{came back positive for rohypnol, a common date rape drug. traces were also found on the bottle of beer at the crime scene. both mr. clifford and miss sandoval's fingerprints were all over the bottle.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i took it from her. she was far too young to be drinking!}
<A>__{a slam of the gavel silences jay.}
<C>__{d.a. meese}
<D>__{dr. borman i am going to show you what's been marked as state's exhibit number 1.}
<A>__{he nods to the bailiff and a projector whirs to life. an evidence photo that chad took of elena's wounds is displayed on a screen beside him.}
<C>__{d.a. meese}
<D>__{what does this slide show?}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{miss sandoval was found to have numerous bite marks on her upper torso that occurred during the rape.}
<C>__{judge wilcox}
<D>__{what about those other markings?}
<A>__{chad looks confused, studies the slide, sees four equidistant dots aligned in a small circle.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{i wasn't able to determine...fingernail markings, possibly...}
<C>__{judge wilcox}
<P>__{(to meese)}
<D>__{please continue.}
<A>__{marie can barely breathe...}
<C>__{d.a. meese}
<D>__{i'm going to show you another slide that's been marked as state's exhibit number 2.}
<A>__{meese nods to the bailiff, who dutifully changes the slide. the court goes dark for a second before the next slide is displayed...it's a close up of jay's teeth mouldings compared to the bite marks...}
<C>__{d.a. meese}
<D>__{what can you tell us about these mouldings?}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{they were made from the defendant's teeth, and the tests i conducted show there's simply no other conclusion. the bite marks on miss sandoval's body were made by the defendant, mr. jay clifford...}
<A>__{that's it. the court erupts, flashbulbs exploding. jay slumps back in his chair, his air of cool gone in an instant. he looks back at marie, utter disbelief on his face. the tears well in her eyes... the judge bangs his gavel in a vain attempt to regain control.}
<C>__{judge wilcox}
<D>__{court's adjourned...}
