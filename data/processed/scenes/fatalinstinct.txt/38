<A>__{he steps out, pauses... turns to her.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{don't forget to lock up.}
<A>__{ned pulls the door shut. the lock clicks. he pauses by his car, realizing something, heaves a sigh, goes back to the door. he tries the knob, but the door is locked. he looks through the small window. he sees lola standing inside... breathing heavily, bracing herself against the staircase bannister, hand to her heaving chest as if to calm a pounding heart. he pushes against the door. it won't budge. he goes to the large window, gazing inside. she slides one hand enticingly across her breast and thigh, striking a seductive pose. he points toward the door, motioning for her to unlock it. she looks away. frustrated, ned tries the window. it's locked. he picks up a wrought iron chair, slams it into the window! the heavy chair falls apart. the glass doesn't even vibrate! he sees a riding power mower in the driveway... jumps into the seat, starts the engine... barreling toward the front of the house! thunder crashes and lightning flashes in the sky! he plows into the side of the house, smashing a huge hole thru the wall!... mowing a swath in the carpet! lola gasps. ned climbs off the mower, moving toward her. she opens her arms, breathless. the music swells dramatically! she intercepts him, embracing him passionately.}

<C>__{lola}
<D>__{that's not what you came back for.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{yes it is.}
<A>__{impatient, she crushes her mouth against his, kissing him hard, desperately clawing at his clothes. she's relentless... devouring him with her lips and tongue. overwhelmed, he succumbs to her passion. his car keys drop from his hand. she pushes him down toward the floor. low angle at floor level her hands grasp his shirt, ripping it open. the buttons fly in all directions! she grabs at his leather belt, twisting it in her hands... ripping it in two! she grabs his pants by the cuffs... rips one pant leg off! then the other!... tossing them over each shoulder! ned and lola tumble across the floor, arms and legs entangled... rolling themselves up in a rug in the process. angle fireplace a roaring fire. we hear o.c. moaning and heavy breathing. the camera tilts down to a sheepskin rug in front of the fireplace. no one is there! a crystal vase falls, crashing on the stone hearth. the camera tilts up to reveal ned and lola... stretched out on the mantle, ravishing each other. angle the refrigerator the door suddenly bursts open! ned and lola tumble out... wrapped in each other's arms, food tumbling out with them.}

<A>__{sequence from original script. angle the dining room table the table wiggles. the camera moves up to reveal ned and lola kissing passionately. she lays on the table, arms and legs stretched upward... a spinning plate balanced on the pointed finger of each hand... and a large spinning platter balanced on the end of her pointed left toe. her right foot brushes the platter to keep it spinning. the ed sullivan show position. several angles in bed ned and lola's entangled legs, moving under the sheets. ned sitting, wrists tied to the brass bed with silk scarves. lola, also with her wrists tied to the bed with silk scarves. then... a wider angle... revealing that they are both tied... at opposite ends of the same bed! angle the basement stairs wrapped in each other's arms, they tumble down the stairs... crashing into a workbench, still kissing passionately! angle a wall socket ned's hand plugs in a cord. rack focus to a soft lamb's wool buffer wheel rising into frame, whirring. it dips into an open can of floor wax... then moves over to lola's naked body, buffing the surface of her skin to a high gloss. the camera moves to her eyes. they're crossed in ecstasy. angle the bedroom floor heavy breathing. squeaky bed noises. the camera moves up along the mattress. the bed moves with a jerky rhythm. the camera reveals lola's hand, grasping the sheet tightly. we move up to lola, lying face down against the pillow.}
