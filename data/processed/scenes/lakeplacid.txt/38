<L>__{exterior hector's tent night}
<A>__{two deputies are digging deep pits about thirty feet in front of his tent. from within we hear music, the sounds of a party. keough approaches... looks at deputy burke, who's digging.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{he paid us. five hundred.}
<A>__{keough continues on toward the tent.}
<L>__{interior hector's tent continuous}
<A>__{his tent is on the palatial side. stereo, generator, he's got a margarita bar going. there's a party. hector's dancing with deputy gare, others are enjoying the drinks and music.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you're a beautiful woman.}
<C>__{gare}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{and law enforcement, such dangerous work. the idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.}
<A>__{upon which, keough enters, doesn't like what he sees.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{he goes, turns off the music.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{we are here on official business.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{cocktail?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{no!!}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{what's with digging the holes?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{they come on land and they're brazen. they're also attracted to noise, you can see i make a lot of it.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{everybody out, back to your tents, now!}
<A>__{they start to leave.}
<C>__{hector}

<C>__{keough }
<P>__{(to hector)}
<D>__{you listen to me. the only reason i'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar }
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{and you like me.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{i do not like you.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{deep down, gut check. i'm growing fond of you and it's liberating to say so.}
<A>__{keough stares back.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{you're a whacko.}
