<L>__{interior dining room, nolan house thanksgiving, 1930}
<A>__{the families, along with ngunda and filamena, are gathered in the dining room, their heads bowed in prayer. we see daisy across from benjamin... the prayer's finished, it's noisy...}
<C>__{ngunda oti}
<D>__{we pray to bembe... the creator of all living things... she retired after all that work...}
<C>__{daisy}
<P>__{(needing to top that)}
<D>__{did you know turkeys aren't really birds...?}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{they're in the pheasant family. they can hardly fly. it's sad don't you think? a bird, that can't fly.}
<C>__{ngunda oti}
<D>__{i like birds that can't fly. they're easy to eat.}
<C>__{queenie}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{i have something to tell you all...}
<A>__{they're quiet.}
<C>__{queenie }
<D>__{while we're giving thanks for god's blessings... i've had a miracle happen.}
<P>__{(she touches her stomach)}
<D>__{the lord saw fit to answer my prayers.}
<A>__{the people applaud the good news.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{what does she mean "answered her prayers?"}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{she's going to have a baby, silly. that's what my mother said when i was going to have a little brother. he didn't live long though. he didn't breathe right...}
<A>__{and we can see benjamin's heart beginning to break... he looks over, tizzy, proudly smiling... and as queenie accepts congratulations... benjamin's old wrinkled face, watching her... looks like he's going to cry...}
