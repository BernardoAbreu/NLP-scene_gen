<L>__{interior the hitchcocks' bel air home bathroom morning}
<A>__{the gleaming white tiles of a bathroom. we move past chrome fixtures that evoke those in spellbound and psycho and arrive at that same pudgy hand pouring chateau cheval blanc '53 into a cut crystal glass.}
<C>__{hitchcock}
<A>__{soaks in the tub. the champagne glass beside him, his corpulent frame is covered only by the london times he's reading. even in this deeply vulnerable state, he maintains the air of a haughty mischievous emperor. at the sound of a bedroom bureau being opened, hitch's eyes shift to the full length mirror on the bathroom door.}
<B>__{in the mirror}
<A>__{we catch fleeting glimpses of alma in a white half slip and matching bra. she takes out some nylons and holds them up to the light. hitchcock watches enthralled. he puts down his glass and shifts a little in the tub, causing the water to lap against the sides. bedroom continuous alma pauses when she hears the small splashes. neither upset nor amused she continues about her business, taking a skirt from the drawer.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{muhammad had the eyes of peeping toms gouged out with arrows.}
<A>__{hitchcock clears his throat, rattling his paper as if he'd been reading the whole time.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{talking of arrows, did you read mr. weiler's review in the new york times? apparently, he found "the climax" to be and i quote "overdrawn."}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{i doubt whether mr. weiler has had a climax in years.}
<A>__{alma steps into her skirt as hitch opens the london times.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{and how about this little grenade?}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{north by northwest reminds us of hitchcock's earlier, more youthfully inventive spy thrillers."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and just to drive the nail into the coffin, there's a handy accompanying guide to the new masters of suspense.}
<A>__{hitchcock zeroes in on the photographs. they're all young. thinner. and with hair.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{why do they keep looking for new masters of suspense when they still have the original?}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{don't be maudlin, you know how much it aggravates me.}
<A>__{he catches his reflection in the mirror again and sinks further down into the water to hide his protruding belly. alma comes in, takes the newspapers from him and puts them on the side.}
<C>__{alma }
<D>__{stop reading them. you've been reading them for a week now.}
<A>__{she puts down the toilet seat and sits on it.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{tell me, dear. am i really too old?}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{yes. a true relic. and lest we forget, a notably corpulent one.}
<A>__{she comes over and kisses the top of his head.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{you always know precisely where to plunge the dagger, don't you?}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{right between the shoulder blades. i learned it from your pictures.}
<A>__{she moves off to the mirror to apply lipstick and hitchcock surreptitiously picks up the papers again...}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{where are you off to?}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{i'm seeing whit for brunch after i drop you off at the studio. why don't you join us?}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{we've just established that i'm too corpulent to be seen in broad daylight.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{you'll feel better as soon as you find a project. hasn't peggy unearthed any decent books yet?}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{sleeping pills with dust jackets.}
<A>__{alma steps back to inspect herself in the full length mirror. today's outfit is, we sense, rather more stylish than what she would ordinarily wear.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{hitch's gaze never leaves the photo gallery of his younger rivals in the `new masters of suspense' article...}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{very presentable.}
<B>__{on alma}
<A>__{as she elegantly masks her hurt.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{hurry up, darling. you're pruning.}
<A>__{she leaves. hitch grumbles and tosses his paper aside. he rises from the depths but suddenly loses his balance and grabs onto the shower curtain, wrenching it from the metal rings on the rod. a god's eye view, looking down, as hitchcock stares up at the metal rings spinning noisily on the metal rod.}
