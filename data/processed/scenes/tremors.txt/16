<L>__{exterior viola's place day}
<A>__{close on a stencilled sign: pham van's u rent cesspool, septic tanks. pull out to see val and earl have rented a portable septic pump (perhaps trailer mounted). the aged machine reeks of and drips with its ignoble cargo. the intake hose has been repaired so often it looks to be more tape than hose. grimacing val threads the slimy hose down through the open top of viola's cesspool. beside them is viola's well kept mobile home on a low hill not far from pham van's store. well kept flower gardens surround the place. viola, a sweet little old lady, watches the men work while straining to hold the leash of her tiny but ferocious dog. the dog yaps continuously, lunging at val and earl.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{stop it! stop it, you horrid animal!}
<P>__{(to val and earl)}
<D>__{i'm going to give her back to my son. i swear it.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{hey, viola, you've got my permission.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{god almighty, my mama sure didn't raise me for this.}
<A>__{val gets up and starts the pump's gas engine.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{well, you're the one won't work in the car wash. you're the one's gotta have a plan.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{damn it, val! not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!}
<A>__{earl angrily throws the pump valve and starts the pump mechanism. he and val on stand either side of the intake hose as it gurgles happily.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{what keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet. i was up for going to bixby. i was getting excited.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{in the past year i must've said a hundred times "we gotta get out of perfection. we gotta better ourselves." you gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think i'm the reason we're still here? you want to know how close i am to going to bixby right now ?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{i will call that little bluff. how close?}
<A>__{pow! goooosh! the gurgling intake hose ruptures, showering them with well you know. they react as if they'd been shot; gagging, staggering, screaming obscenities.}
