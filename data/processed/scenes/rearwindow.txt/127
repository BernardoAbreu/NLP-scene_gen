<A>__{a big head of jeff. he is still in his wheelchair, sound asleep. the camera pans off his face, out through the window. the rain has stopped, and the general light of dawn is coming up. the camera comes to rest on the salesman's apartment and corridor, which is still dimly lit by the electric lights. we see the salesman emerge into the corridor, pause a moment to allow a woman to proceed him. her back is to the camera and we do not see her face. they move away, down the corridor. the camera pans back into jeff's sleeping face.}
