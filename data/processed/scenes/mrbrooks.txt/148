<L>__{interior mr. smith's apartment n night}
<A>__{on her way in, atwood draws her gun. keeping close to the walls she audits the kitchen. all the cabinet doors are open. dishes, pots and pans, cutlery, gone. she moves on to the bathroom. soap, shampoo, toilet paper, toothpaste, toothbrushes, towels, washcloths, the contents of the medicine cabinet, gone. she moves on to the bedroom. bed, night table, lamps, t.v., computer, gone. clothes closets, empty of everything. she looks around. mr. smith's entire apartment has been stripped absolutely clean, except... ... there's a crumpled piece of paper in the far corner of the bedroom. atwood goes over and gets down on one knee. with her fingers pulling at the corners she is able to straighten the paper enough to make out that it's a work order from a moving company. reading it with the paper pinched between thumb and forefinger of her left hand, atwood rises. there's the silhouette of a man in the doorway behind her.}
