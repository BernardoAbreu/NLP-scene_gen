<L>__{int church basement day}
<A>__{close up on patrick (30s, pony tail). he has a guitar.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{... we are gathered here today literally in the heart of jesus.}
<A>__{angle on hazel who just shakes her head. this is the lamest thing she could be doing right now.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{who would like to share their story with the group?}
<A>__{the basement is filled with sick people. hazel among them. most are under the age of 18. quick cuts:}
<D>__{speaker #1 jillian. 15. lymphoma. speaker #2 angel. 17. ewing sarcoma.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{patrick. 34. testicular. it started a few years ago, when i was...}
<A>__{as hazel watches, bored, and patrick continues, we hear:}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{i will spare you the gory details of patrick's ball cancer. basically, they found it in his nuts, cut most of it out, he almost died, but he didn't die, and now here he is divorced, friendless, addicted to video games, exploiting his cancertastic past in the heart of jesus "literally" to show us that one day if we're lucky we could be just like him.}
<A>__{they all say:}
<C>__{all in unison}
<D>__{"we're here for you patrick."}
<A>__{hazel says it the least enthusiastically. she locks eyes with her only friend in support group, a blonde kid with an eye patch, isaac. he's also shaking his head.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{who else would like to share?}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{hazel?}
<A>__{oh no. patrick gestures for her to speak. reluctantly she stands, sighs...}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i'm, uh, hazel. 16.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{thyroid originally but with quite the impressive satellite colony in my lungs.}
<A>__{not much more to say, hazel is about to sit down.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{and how are you doing hazel?}
<A>__{hazel has no idea how to answer that.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{you mean besides the terminal cancer?}
<A>__{but that's not what she says. she says:}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{alright? i guess...?}
<A>__{isaac tries not to laugh at this. hazel sits back down.}
<C>__{all in unison}
<D>__{"we're here for you hazel."}
<A>__{hazel exhales. this is not at all helpful. a few more beats.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{maybe now i will play a song...}
