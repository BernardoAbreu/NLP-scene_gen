<T>__{her pov:}
<A>__{ruben, now seems a vast distance away from her. he is just turning down the stairs and is gone... the hallway first narrows, squeezing her in, then expands. she is lost in the miles and miles of space between the two walls.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh, god! help me!}
<A>__{ruben reappears, races toward her...}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{tell me what to do!}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm falling! i'm going to fall!}
<A>__{she starts to pass out, to sink to her knees, but ruben catches her, puts her up against the wall, handling her like a suspect. he puts one hand on the back of her neck, spreads her legs, gets her in frisk position. somehow, this is comforting to her, but she is still in full blown panic...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{...falling... falling!}
<A>__{he pressed his body up against hers, his weight anchoring her against the feeling of free fall.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{i'm right here. i won't let you fall.}
<A>__{he still has a hand on the back of her neck. suddenly, the proximity effects him, makes him want to kiss her neck. she begins to hyperventilate.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{don't let go... i can't breathe... i will die!}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{shhh. it's okay. just breathe. i will fix it...}
<A>__{ruben takes out his gun...}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{put your hands over your ears.}
<A>__{ruben shoots off the lock. then he picks helen up and carries her back into her apartment.}
