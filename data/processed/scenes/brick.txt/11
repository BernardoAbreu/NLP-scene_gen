<A>__{one of many instances of an allusion to the jerr backstory, most of which were trimmed back in the editing process for clarity. the author has threatened to write it as a stand alone short story, but probably never will, so in a nutshell: when brendan and emily were still an item she started hanging out with jerr, a small time dealer. brendan didn't approve, so he partnered up with jerr then ratted him out to trueman. emily found out, and that led to their breakup on the field, which we see in a flashback.}
