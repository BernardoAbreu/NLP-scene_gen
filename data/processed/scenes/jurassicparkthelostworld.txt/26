<L>__{exterior lagoon day}
<A>__{lush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon. sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground, bleaching the nearby foliage white. in the distance one can hear the cries of jungle birds. the boat is now beached and the crew flips the tarps off the aav, the jeep, and the trailers. the trucks back down a narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the lagoon. there is a large three toad animal imprint in the clay at the water's edge, and the aav backs right over it, swapping its track for the animal's. malcolm is at the edge of the water with the captain.}
