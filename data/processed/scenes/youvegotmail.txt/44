<L>__{exterior kathleen's building night}
<A>__{as we see kathleen, through her curtains, a small figure barely lit by her computer.}
<P>__{kathleen (v.o., cont'd)}
<D>__{i don't really want an answer. i just want to send this cosmic question out into the void. so goodnight, dear void.}
<L>__{interior drip day}
<A>__{drip is a cafe on amsterdam avenue with fifties style couches and chairs in cozy seating arrangements. kathleen is standing at the front counter with christina, getting drinks.}
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{i went to the foxbooks website and you can buy anything. they ship it to you in a day. maybe we should get a website.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{my mother would never have wanted us to have a website. "every book you sell is a gift from your heart." she always said that.}
<A>__{as they walk toward the back of the cafe, kathleen notices a stack of loose leaf binders on the table.}
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{what if they put us out of business?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{it's out of the question. we're a fixture in the neighborhood. we're practically a landmark.}
<P>__{(indicating the binders)}
<D>__{men for women, women for men, women for women what is this?}
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{you fill out one of these forms and they file it in the book and if someone wants to meet you, they arrange it.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{what a stupid way to meet someone.}
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{compared to the internet?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{my little thing on the internet is just a lark.}
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{so it's still going on?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{and i do not plan to meet him.}
<P>__{(indicating the book)}
<D>__{why do i get the feeling that you are in here somewhere?}
<A>__{christina flips the book open to her application.}
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{i came in here one night and drank too much coffee and filled one out.}
<P>__{(off kathleen's look)}
<D>__{well how am i supposed to meet someone?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{you are a runner. some day you will make eye contact with another runner and }
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{no one ever even looks at me. they don't. on top of which, who are they? they could like the symphony. i could never fall in love with someone who likes to go to the symphony }
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{i know. what are you supposed to do there?}
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{sit. you're supposed to sit.}
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{i could never fall in love with anyone who smokes cigars either.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{i will tell you what i hate. big fat legs like stumps.}
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{yeah. i hate that too.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{the worst, the worst i could never, under any circumstances, love anybody who had a sailboat.}
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{neither could i.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{if i had to get up on saturday morning knowing that i was about to go down to the pier and unravel all those ropes and put on all that sunblock }
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{all that talk about the wind.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{and then you have to go out on the boat, and you sail and sail and sail until you are bored witless, and then, only then, do they say, let's turn around and you realize the trip is only half over, only it's not, because the wind has changed }
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{it hasn't changed. it's died.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{so then there's more talk about the wind. while you just float up and down trying not to get nauseous. and when you finally get back, you have to clean up the boat.}
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{why don't people have boat maids?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{i know. there're all these people who wouldn't be caught dead polishing a doorknob in their house but put them on a boat and they want to rub down everything in sight.}
