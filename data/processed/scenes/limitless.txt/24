<A>__{as eddie passes, a neighbor's door swings open. eddie tries walking faster.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{i didn't want to see anybody.}
<A>__{valerie, 26 and attractive, emerges, dressed to go out.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) especially not my landlord's nasty young wife.}
<A>__{she is immediately soured at the sight of eddie. eddie knows what she's thinking.}

<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{steve handles the rents. so feed your fucking bullshit to him.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{i suddenly had extra reason to get away from her. i had thoughtlessly ingested a substance.}
<A>__{valerie's tirade fades up or down, depending on when we're hearing eddie.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{ like the rent's not low enough !}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{i had gotten remarkably little information from vernon about what this drug would do.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{you could be a bike messenger and come up with that!}
<A>__{eddie continues up the stairs. but she follows, getting in front of him.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{...what if it was a hallucinogen... oh my god... listening to her rag, if i were tripping...? i'd jump out a fucking window.}
<A>__{valerie's voice fades up.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{ look, i'm just telling you, he's been talking about calling these people he knows from the club to muscle you out i've told him not to do that, but he's really pissed.}
<A>__{we push in on eddie's face, into his eyes... where we see his pupils contract just slightly. a flicker.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{and then... i felt it.}
<A>__{eddie's pov the apartment upper hall... the room is changing... springing into sharper focus.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{levels more, layers more, 3 d more... galactically more. but the same. just the depth and beauty... of clarity.}
<A>__{there seems to be more definition, more dimension, a little more light he can see more clearly. the sound drops out for a moment; he can see valerie's face, mouth contorted, continuing to heap the abuse, but there's something in her eyes that's not mean... something anxious.he looks at her with a sudden keen intelligence. and sympathy.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{she's taken aback.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{w what?}
<A>__{his eyes go to the book bag in her arms.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{"i was blind but now i see."}
<A>__{on a gut instinct, eddie takes a shot, pushing his words forward with a new, sharp, penetrating intimacy, articulateness.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{you don't like me, and i don't blame you you see a schlumpy energy sucking defeated sack of shit sponging off your husband. you're hoping i will blow my brains out. but my existence shouldn't make you this upset. what is it?}
<A>__{he's hit a nerve.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{look, that's none of your }
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{something wrong at school?}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{how do you know i'm in school!}
<A>__{his eyes flick down at her bag.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{people who aren't don't usually carry dry, academic constipated out of print books about dorothea lange.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{are you some kind of creep? have you been following me?!}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i just saw the book }
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{you can only see a corner of it. how did you know?}
<A>__{he looks down. she's right only a corner of the book is visible. eddie realizes:}
