<L>__{interior imhotep's chamber day}
<A>__{evelyn's hand slips the key into the sarcophagus, lock and turns it. a series of strange mechanical like sounds are heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a giant hiss. o'connell, evelyn and jonathan all look very, very hungover. they start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus. pushing, shoving and groaning, the lid budging, inch by inch.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i can't believe i allowed the two of you to get me drunk.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{don't blame me, i don't even remember being there.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{well neither do i, thank you.}
<A>__{o'connell gives her a hurt look.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{you don't?}
<A>__{evelyn gives o'connell a nervous look.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{no... why?... should i?}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.}
<A>__{o'connell gives her a big cheesy smile. evelyn's face drops, appalled and embarrassed. and that's when the lid falls off and loudly crashes to the ground. all three of them instantly grab their sore heads and moan.}
