<L>__{exterior ruidoso downs day}
<A>__{an angle on four people at a table, cheering a race, switching to disgust and despair when they lose, moving away from the table, leaving their betting tickets behind. lilly passes by, smoothly and casually scoops up the tickets, moves on along a row of tables, and there finding more tickets.}
<L>__{interior jeweler's office day}
<A>__{myra sits as before. the jeweler enters with a check, which he hands her. she looks up at him, making no move to leave.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{i hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, mrs. langtry.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{it's not your fault.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{you'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, i hope. if there's anything you think we might be interested in...}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{i have only one thing now. are you interested?}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{well, i'd have to see it, of course.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{you are seeing it. you're looking right at it.}
<A>__{the jeweler is puzzled, then startled.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{he turns away, goes behind his desk, sits down, looks at myra.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{you know something, mrs. langtry? a bracelet like that very rarely happens. a fine setting and workmanship usually mean precious stones. it always hurts me when i find they're not. i always hope }
<P>__{(faint sad friendly smile)}
<D>__{ i'm mistaken.}
<A>__{myra likes him better now, even though he hasn't solved her problem. she rises.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{thank you. for everything you felt you could do.}
