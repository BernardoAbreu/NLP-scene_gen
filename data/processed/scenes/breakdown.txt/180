<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{deke, i need you to open this.}
<A>__{deke looks at his father. he kneels, unlocks the padlock and heaves open the trap door, revealing a narrow staircase slanting into the cellar. deke looks down into the darkness and swallows.}

<C>__{deke }
<D>__{dad...}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{it's all right, son. just ignore that stuff.}
<A>__{jeff crouches to peer into the cellar. jeff's pov cellar roots and mildew hang in strings from the ceiling. the light is a bare bulb. there are several distressingly shaped garbage bags against the wall.}

<A>__{his gaze shifts back to red.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(to deke)}

<A>__{amy climbs the stairs quickly. scraps of duct tape cling to her wrists. she throws her arm around jeff.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{they were going to kill me.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i know, baby. it's okay. they can't hurt you now.}

<C>__{red}
<D>__{remember this moment, pretty boy. 'cause whatever happens, no matter how far you run, i will hunt you down and kill you like a dog.}
<A>__{jeff stares back. a beat, then:}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{go to hell.}
<A>__{he boots red in the chest, sending him backward down the steps. he slams the trap door shut and locks the padlock. he looks around, sees a massive tool chest. he tips it onto the trap door crash! then he takes amy's hand, still keeping an eye out for billy.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{let's get out of here.}
<A>__{they run from the barn.}
