<L>__{exterior upscale neighborhood day}
<A>__{magnificent old mansions occupy five acre bay front parcels amid lush, tropical settings. sam's jeep stops before a pair of gates with the words "van ryan" woven into their wrought iron design. beyond the gates a long drive leads toward a huge stone house. kelly jumps out, punches in a code. the gates swing open.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{don't forget the car wash.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i won't.}
<A>__{sandra van ryan, kelly's mom, big, sexy, aggressive, a young 42 in a string bikini, comes out from the side of the house. when she sees the jeep, she starts down the drive. kelly waves to sam, then walks up the drive. when she sees her mother coming toward her, her face hardens.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{is that sam lombardo?}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{hi, mon.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{sam! hi!}
<A>__{sam has already hung a u. sandra comes through the gate and up to the jeep. jimmy is checking her out. all eyes.}
<C>__{sandra }
<P>__{(to sam; as if jimmy wasn't even there)}
<D>__{what? you're going to drive off without even saying hi?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hi, sandy.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{why don't you come in, have a drink?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{can't. got a passenger.}
<A>__{sandra looks down her nose at jimmy.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{he can wait.}
<A>__{sam glances past her, to kelly, who stands languidly at the front of the house, watching.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i can't, sandy. i've got to run.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{i will bet.}
<P>__{(then, softening)}
<D>__{look, sam. why don't you come by this weekend. we'll take the boat out...}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(cutting her off)}
<D>__{sorry, sandy. i've got plans.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{what? running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{swamp's where it's at, sandy. gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of. you ought to try it some time.}
<A>__{sandra gives him a hard stare, then marches off toward the house.}
<B>__{close on kelly}
<A>__{still at the door, a cold smile on her face.}
