<L>__{int van (day)}
<A>__{a sweaty luther:}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{i'm booted up. go, ethan.}
<C>__{billy's voice}
<D>__{he's heading down the stairs, now..}
<A>__{ethan places the digital camera on play and begins to go thru the stills. as they cliff off, ethan is visibly affected.}
<B>__{luther in the van}
<A>__{watches the stills as well. he's no less affected.}
<B>__{ethan with nyah}
<A>__{he mutters some expletive under his breath, then, evenly:}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i want you out of ambrose's place.}
<C>__{billy's voice}
<D>__{he's one tier from the bottom.}
<A>__{ethan glances over to the bottom of the stairs.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{as he lowers camera and removes the memory card.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i want you out of there.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{why? what's happened. what did you see?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{thirty steps..}
<A>__{slipping card back into envelope.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{nyah, you've done more than enough. even the best of snake charmers get bit.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{ethan, tell me }
<C>__{billy's voice}
<D>__{twenty, nineteen..}
<A>__{ethan's been talking to someone he's been urging to walk, not run to the nearest exit. now he drops all pretence:}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i want you out of australia!}
<P>__{(more quickly)}
<D>__{..i don't know how much more plainly i can put it.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{how do you suggest i go about it?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{he's touched your heart. you're overwhelmed. you need to think it over. you'll meet him somewhere in a month. if you're not out in 48 hours i'm coming in and getting you out. give me the ear piece.}
<A>__{she just gets it out of her hear and gives it to ethan when she reaches the bookie who warns her to get down her bet. she gives him her money and gets the tickets just as the buzzer goes off no more bets. flustered by it she picks up her tickets but drops the envelope. she quickly kneels and scrambles to recover it, tucking it away and looking up to see stamp standing over her. almost exactly where ethan had stood when she looked away.}
<B>__{nyah}
<A>__{tries not to register alarm while she gauges how much stamp had seen.}
<C>__{stamp}
<D>__{get your bet down?}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{just..}
<A>__{she rises. stamp waits only a moment then follows. at the private bleachers (day) everyone's on their feet, the horses are in the backstretch. ambrose is watching the race through binoculars. nyah comes up behind and puts her arms around him. with her left hand she puts the envelope into his right jacket pocket.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{your nag is making a run for it on the outside!}
<P>__{(lowering binoculars)}
<D>__{bloody hell, nyah!}
<A>__{she's momentarily startled. then:}
<C>__{ambrose }
<D>__{you picked another winner!}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{well, that's good, isn't?}
<A>__{a blow up (interior sheep farm imf safehouse day) of a shot from a digital camera card.}
