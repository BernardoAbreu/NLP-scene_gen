<L>__{exterior alley dumpsters night}
<A>__{ronna half carries mannie down the alley. he's too heavy to lift, and too out of it to go much further. he collapses to his knees. she can't get him back up. without warning, he heaves. we hear the splash on the asphalt. she props his head back against a dumpster. wipes his face.}
