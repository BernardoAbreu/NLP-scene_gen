<L>__{exterior cliff face}
<A>__{on an escarpment high above the dense green rainforest cover, pk and doc move along the sheer cliff face with photographic equipment and rucksacks. pk notices doc's labored breathing and slow movements. they reach some small cacti growing out of the side of the cliff in full bloom.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(breathing hard)}
<D>__{ach. you see how beautiful?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{you ever hear of glycerine, doc?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{mr. going to oxford smarty pants. of course i know about glycerine. triglycerine. biglycerine. monoglycerine. what do you want to know?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{why you don't use it. it's only a little pill under the tongue.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{tongues were not made to put little pills under. when i have to start with that, i become something else.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{well, until you become something else, the little pills would make this easier on your heart.}
<A>__{a clap of thunder cuts into their conversation. thick roiling rain clouds appear suddenly.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{little pills or no little pills we don't find cover, we both turn into something else.}
<A>__{lightning splits the sky. rain begins to fall, pelting the escarpment.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{look for a cave. always in this kind of rock there is caves. quick! quick!}
<A>__{pk starts to move horizontally across the cliff face like a spider on a wall. doc follows. the rain becomes torrential. pk turns to look back at doc.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{don't look at me. go!}
<A>__{pk forges ahead. his pov opening some 20 yards ahead.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i've found something.}
<A>__{the rain is so heavy pk can barely make out doc behind him. when he can, he sees the old man pause, breathing hard. pk makes his way back to doc. halfway there, doc waves him forward and starts to move. pk reaches the small opening and slips in.}
