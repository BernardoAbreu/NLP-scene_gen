<L>__{exterior notre dame cathedral day}
<A>__{the great cathedral rises next to the monastery where aramis resides. we pan down and push in on the cobblestones between the two structures, as if penetrating to }
<B>__{subterranean passages}
<A>__{aramis leads porthos through tunnels, twisting, descending.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{aramis... is this the way to hell?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{hell may be our destination, dear porthos, but not this trip.}
<A>__{they reach an iron door and move through it, into a gorgeous, secret chapel candles illuminate masterpiece frescoes. the place is breathtaking.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{where are we?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{jesus of nazareth found the holy among the profane. if we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?}
<A>__{porthos notices niches in the walls; he looks closely and sees the face of a corpse, enclosed behind glass.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{mother of god!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{it is also a place of burial.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{a tomb? we're in a tomb?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{catacombs. very holy.}
<A>__{porthos looks as if the bodies could resurrect at any moment then jumps out of his skin as the door opens.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{yaaaahhh!}
<A>__{a hooded figure, looking like the grim reaper, enters.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{relax, you big fool, it's d'artagnan.}
<A>__{and sure enough the hooded figure, whom we now see has been led in by a little monk, is d'artagnan. aramis nods to the monk, who leaves quickly. before d'artagnan can ask anything, porthos jumps again; the back door has opened, and monks usher in athos, who freezes as he sees d'artagnan.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{it's all right. d'artagnan was the one who warned us that he'd been given an order for your arrest. here you have sanctuary does he not, d'artagnan?}
<A>__{the escort monks disappear, closing the chapel door so that the four musketeers are left to sit at a small table the monks have set up, athos and d'artagnan opposite each other.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{look at us. we are old men now. but once we were young. and when we saw injustice, we fought it.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{we have grown wiser with age. now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{and some problems cannot be settled without one.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{well here is the problem at hand: the king has ordered me to discover the identity of the governor general of jesuits, and kill him. as our english rivals have left the catholic church, louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of europe by uniting church and state and making himself head of both. he has already picked the pope. only the jesuits, who put god above throne or papacy, stand in his way.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{but doesn't god ordain both pope and king?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{so they tell us. but what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression? when no conscience is tolerated? no dissent, no objection?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{it is a weighty problem, aramis but perhaps you should leave it to this secret general of the jesuits, whoever he might be.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{easy to say, but hard to do. for what i am trying to tell you is that i am the governor general of jesuits in france.}
<A>__{a stunned silence.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{what do you propose to do?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{replace the king.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i cannot hear this!}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{it can't be done.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{it can. i know the way.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i am with you!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{no! stop }
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i will need you all. all for one. one for all.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(jumping up)}
<D>__{you you cannot ask me to betray my king! i have sworn to him!}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{it is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{an oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{why do you follow him, d'artagnan?! i know you have put service above your own life, but why does this king deserve such loyalty? he is a monster! he executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame! he has no honor!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{no man is all bad... or all good. i believe i must believe that louis can learn. and perhaps i can help him.}
<A>__{athos leaps up from the table, and glares at d'artagnan.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{whatever the plan... i am in it! the next time we meet, one of us will die.}
<A>__{he storms out of the rear door of the chapel.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{porthos, see to athos, won't you?}
<A>__{porthos follows athos; aramis and d'artagnan are left alone.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i have heard many confessions, d'artagnan. but even if i were not a priest, i could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{the secret i carry i cannot share. not even with god.}
<A>__{d'artagnan moves to the door.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i cannot betray louis. i will defend him with my life.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i know. god go with you.}
<A>__{d'artagnan leaves aramis alone in the secret chapel.}
