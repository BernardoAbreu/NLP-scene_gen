<A>__{as morty holds a small gift wrapped box in his hands we hear a tinny version of the song dreidel, dreidel, dreidel. he tears open the wrapping paper to reveal a dreidel. he looks at his gift, and then looks off screen. we pan with his look to reveal... a group of christian children congregating around a large, garishly decorated christmas tree. a very vegas merry christmas sign flashes as a larger than life hi fi version of the christmas song jingle bells blares. the children festively slap high fives as they open their presents. we cut to a slow motion cu of gentile boy 1 enamored with his brand new atc motorbike. we cut to a slow motion cu of gentile girl 1. she wears an "i love jesus" t shirt and holds an adorable dog with a bow affixed to its head in her arms. it licks her on the face. we cut back to mordechai. he looks down at his pathetic excuse for a present. he's on the verge of tears. gentile boy 1 calls to mordechai as he drives his atc.}
<C>__{gentile boy 1}
<D>__{hey everybody! look what mordechai got. nice spinning top morty.}
<A>__{the other children take notice of mordechai's gift and begin to laugh. mordechai is crushed. mrs. highsmith (40's), an incredibly waspy teacher puts down her copy of 'modern w.a.s.p.,' and appears genuinely concerned by the teasing mordechai has weathered. she walks over to comfort him.}
<C>__{mrs. highsmith}
<D>__{now, now class let's not make fun of mordechai's spinning top. we need to all learn the importance of tolerance and understanding. isn't that right mordechai?}
<C>__{mordechai}
<D>__{yes mrs. highsmith.}
<C>__{mrs. highsmith}
<D>__{so class, in honor of mordechai's special day, i'd like for all of us to wish morty a heartfelt merry...}
<A>__{she looks to mordechai for confirmation on the word.}
<C>__{mrs. highsmith }
<P>__{(stumbling)}
<D>__{cha noo kuh day 7.}
<A>__{in unison, the class attempts to repeat the words, but all suffer various degrees of pronunciation problems.}
<C>__{mrs. highsmith }
<D>__{very good class. i hope you've all learned an important lesson today. just because mordechai's people are different from us...just because they might appear strange to us with their furry hats, their beady eyes, and their long sideburns...not to mention their bizarre customs and unnecessarily guttural, funny sounding names...just because they control all of the worlds' money, yet are too cheap to buy their children anything better than spinning tops for presents, does not mean that we can't learn to respect and love them as our equals.}
<A>__{she squeezes his cheek.}
<C>__{mrs. highsmith }
<D>__{happy chanoo juah kah day 7 morty.}
<A>__{a reaction shot of the mortified morty.}
