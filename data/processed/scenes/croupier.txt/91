<A>__{a floodlit tennis court. a racquet smacks a tennis ball. jack sits with giles drinking bloody marys watching a game of mixed doubles. everybody's wearing sweaters. jani is playing with one of giles's friends, gordon. on the other side, two girls, fiona from giles' office, and chloe, gordon's girlfriend. jack follows jani's game. she is far and away the best of the four. giles is also studying jani's movements, her knickers when she serves.}
