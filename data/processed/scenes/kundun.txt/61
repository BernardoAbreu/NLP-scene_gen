<L>__{interior dalai lama's private rooms, evening}
<A>__{a bell and a dorge are laid out on a small table. tenzin gyatso sits in front of this table. a monk is chanting in low, deep tones, in the background. the dalai lama's teacher, taktra rinpoche, sits on the floor. (being the teacher, taktra rinpoche sits slightly higher than the dalai lama.) taktra is an older man, in his sixties. he is stern, solid, no nonsense. taktra rinpoche begins a prayer.}
<C>__{taktra rinpoche}
<D>__{"i take refuge in the three jewels, the buddha, the dharma and the sangra."}
<A>__{but the boy leaps up from his table and goes to taktra and hangs around his neck, shouting:}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{you recite! you recite!}
<A>__{taktra gives the boy just the slightest of looks.}
<C>__{taktra rinpoche}
<D>__{"i take refuge in the three jewels, the buddha, the dharma and the sangra."}
<A>__{tenzin gyatso releases the lama and goes back to his own table.}
<C>__{taktra rinpoche}
<D>__{"until i attain enlightenment."}
<A>__{taktra rinpoche has a small table with the same hand instruments in front of him. the teacher lifts the dorge, in a particular fashion, and rotates it. tenzin gyatso lifts his dorge. taktra's hands move to the boy's and show him the correct movement. it is tried again. now, the bell is lifted and rung.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{i would like you to be my new regent.}
<A>__{taktra stops. he nods to the boy. as the chanting continues, taktra rinpoche begins a weaving motion with his hands, delicate, beautiful, hypnotic. tenzin gyatso copies the elder. we are close on the boy's moving hands. the chanting becomes the voices of a hundred men, as we fade out:}
