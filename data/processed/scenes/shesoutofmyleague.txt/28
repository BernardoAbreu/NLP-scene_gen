<L>__{exterior old strip mall day}
<A>__{kirk, still in his tsa uniform, walks past a large laundromat to a small storefront next door. the chipped and faded lettering on the glass reads, "maury hammerstein, attorney at law aggressive, dynamic representation since 1942!" as kirk reaches for the door, he notices a small hand written sign, "i don't make change!" he goes inside.}
<L>__{interior law office}
<A>__{wood paneling, buzzing fluorescent lights and furniture the salvation army would sell only as firewood. eric and debbie sit with kirk's parents. there are two elderly women and another middle aged man in the room as well. maury, who's about a hundred years old cute and meek, fusses with an ancient vcr while smoking a cigarette. kirk sits down next to eric. kirk notices a free bank calender on maury's desk dated 1991.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{it's about time, numbnuts.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i came right from work.}
<C>__{mr. kettner}
<D>__{okay maury we're all here.}
<C>__{maury}
<D>__{oh! you bet! you betcha! okay, hi there kirk. firstly, let me just say how awful sorry i am. stella was one heck of a gal and a real dish. anyhow, let me just...}
<A>__{maury gets the vcr going. "wheel of fortune" comes up on the screen.}
<C>__{maury }
<D>__{oh mercy. i didn't tape over her with the wheel did i?}
<A>__{the picture goes to snow and then stutters into a shot of grammy sitting in her kitchen. she has just clicked the video camera on with a remote control.}
<C>__{maury }
<D>__{oh, good. there she is.}
<C>__{grammy}
<D>__{testing. one, two, three, four. oh, this god damned thing!}
<A>__{she gets up and fusses with the camera.}
<C>__{grammy }
<D>__{jap piece of shit! is it on!?}
<A>__{cutaway to kirk tearing up. grammy sits back down.}
<C>__{grammy }
<D>__{okay, my name is stella edith dakin and if you're watching this, i'm dead as a doorknob and i ain't spent all my money yet. i got shit to do today so i'm going to get right to it. this is my last will and testament and if you miss anything the old jew's got the paperwork. okay, here's the deal...}
<A>__{everyone besides kirk leans in, excited to hear what they might get. a phone rings. maury looks around but the ringing is coming from the tv. grammy answers the phone.}
<C>__{grammy }
<D>__{hello? i'm kind of busy right now eric... oh, for god's sake, boy! how can you be sure it's even yours? it could be practically anybody's!... no, i'm not paying for that!... well, then i guess you're going to be a daddy. congratulations, now i gotta go!}
<A>__{she hangs up, puts on her glasses and lights up a smoke.}
<C>__{grammy }
<D>__{anyway! i love all of you, despite some of the shit you pulled, but i spent my life a gambler and i always put my money on the best bet. the odds of any of you fish doing anything worthwhile with my stack are slim to none. so old grammy's going all in on big slick.}
<A>__{everyone looks at kirk who is stunned.}
<C>__{grammy }
<D>__{i'm proud of you, kirk. don't let your old grammy down. do something good with it.}
<A>__{she blows a kiss, lifts the remote and aims it at the camera.}
<C>__{grammy }
<D>__{oh, for christ sakes!}
<A>__{she throws the remote at the lens. the picture goes to snow.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{so kirk gets it all!? that is bullshit!}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{eric, it can't be much.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{well!?}
<A>__{maury digs into his desk and pulls out a mess of papers. he dons a pair of glasses that make his eyes look gigantic.}
<C>__{maury}
<D>__{let's see here... looks like she had herself six g's in savings.}
<C>__{maury }
<D>__{um, another three grand in bonds, give or take. her life insurance will pay pert near seventy grand.}
<A>__{he adds this up on an old adding machine (the kind with the hand crank) and writes $77,800 on a chalk board, which is mounted on the wall behind him.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{she left him eighty grand!?}
<C>__{maury}
<D>__{most of stella's retirement home expenses were covered by her reverse mortgage. but, figure in thirty thousand still due to arborwood village. she racked up forty seven thousand in medical bills. and my fee, of course, which now stands at two thousand and change which is real reasonable, folks.}
<A>__{he writes "liabilities = $79,000 total $1,200."}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{so kirk owes money!? ha! shit, man! that is god damn hilarious!}
