<T>__{camera on:}
<L>__{interior rodney's wunderland uncle rodney's trailer day}
<A>__{images of uncle rodney (50) going in and out of focus as he sits on the side of a king sized bed. scars and tatoos litter his arms and neck. his eyes are bit maniacal like charles manson, but he's able to maintain a stoic, but nonetheless dangerous demeanor as jimmy begins setting up the camera. like a prison inmate or rabid dog, you get the feeling that uncle rodney could explode on you at any second. jimmy moves the camera around the room so we briefly see the interior of the trailer. it's an elaborate triple combination of a middle eastern harem, sixties psychedelic motif, and white trash junk yard memorabilia. just out of frame we hear a female voice crying softly, whimpering. the voice is close, in the room with us, but we can't see who's making the sounds. uncle rodney ignores it completely. camera shakes, indicating that jimmy is exceptionally nervous.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{just one second.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{take your time man. i want you to feel comfortable. more importantly, i want you to get this right.}
<A>__{finally, the camera stops shaking. jimmy zooms out to a medium shot revealing that uncle rodney has hazel lying next to him on the bed with her head on his lap. uncle rodney gently strokes her hair like he's petting a dog. hazel, in the midst of extreme withdrawals, cries and whimpers like a child, oblivious to jimmy, the camera, and everything else in the world except for uncle rodney. she is so strung out and her cravings are so intense that she can barely speak.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i'm ready whenever you are.}
<A>__{uncle rodney looks down upon hazel.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{just a second. i have to take care of my baby.}
<A>__{uncle rodney admires his work.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{she's beautiful isn't she?}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(begging, pleading)}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{hazel, entrenched in a crystal methamphetamine psychotic episode, can only gasp in unintelligible spurts.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{some people come here too far gone. like hazel here. the only thing i can do for her is ease her pain.}
<A>__{hazel rolls her body back and forth on the bed, all the while keeping her head in uncle rodney's lap.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{please...}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<P>__{(to hazel)}
<D>__{shhhhh... how about a baby one?}
<A>__{uncle rodney's tenderness in dealing with hazel calms her. he's having way too much fun treating her like a baby.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{uncle rodney takes his pinky and dips it into a small plastic bag of powder. he then places it to hazel's nostril. she quickly snorts the tiny bit off his finger.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<P>__{(to hazel)}
<D>__{there you go...}
<A>__{hazel begins whimpering again. it wasn't nearly enough to satisfy her.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{there's something about addiction that brings out something beautiful in a person. addiction is pure. addiction reduces a person to an infant. and there's nothing more pure and beautiful in the world than an infant.}
<A>__{he puts his finger to hazel's nostril again, but this time, without any meth on the tip. she snorts with all of her might then starts crying. uncle rodney is toying with her.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{hazel is no longer an adult. she's an infant and i'm the surrogate mother who provides her with much needed breast milk. it's a role that both of us have accepted and embrace.}
<A>__{he leans over and grabs a syringe, already filled, then gently holds hazel's arm and expertly injects the liquid into her vein. nothing happens for several seconds. hazel's breathing accelerates. suddenly she sits up, her eyes go wide. hazel clinches the bed as if she were riding a roller coaster.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{that's my girl!}
<A>__{then, she makes eye contact with jimmy. a curious, frightened look comes over her face. clearly, she recognizes him. she suddenly jumps from the bed and runs out of the room.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{she's a little jumpy.}
<A>__{uncle rodney smiles, amusing himself with his own joke.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{let's begin shall we? and please... i'm going to use this tape for my fans, so let's try to get this right.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{i apologize if any of this frightens you or makes you uncomfortable.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i will be fine.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{no. you won't be fine. what i'm going to teach you will be frightening. the truth is an acquired taste but once you get to it, it's all you'll ever want.}
<A>__{uncle rodney starts in on his mantra. it's obvious that he's well versed in his meandering rant.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{those kids out there... we, the so called "undesirables" you and me, we know the truth. you know that society doesn't want you, your parents don't want you, corporate america sure as fuck doesn't want you... you wouldn't be here otherwise.}
<C>__{uncle rodney }
<D>__{if this government had a choice, they'd gas us all in a heartbeat, exterminate us like the jews, enslave us like niggers, cuz don't kid yourself, we are the new niggers in this country. no one respects us... no one sees what we have to offer... no one has compassion for us.... they don't care, or they're too naive to see that we're a by product of a wasteful society that has failed to educate, embrace, influence, or inspire any of us. we're societal garbage. the counter culture no longer exists. it's dead... it's been replaced by us }
<A>__{long pause.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{the garbage culture... thrown aside, imprisoned, institutionalized, systematically abused, executed, and enlisted into wars started by government ass fuckers just to kill us off. just to kill us off. and every week one of you shows up here, disillusioned, addicted, angry, pissed 'cuz they tossed you aside... into the garbage. every time someone like you shows up here the garbage culture gets a little bit stronger and they get a little bit weaker. until the "them" and the "they" of this country run out of places to put us, to put its garbage, and the garbage over flows into their cities from out of the confines of the spaces that they have set aside for us.}
<A>__{a pause, then...}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<P>__{(biblical)}
<D>__{and we will set fire to their world! and we will burn it, until a living hell reigns over what was their former world, and we will fornicate in their ashes!}
<A>__{rodney stops, almost out of breath.}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{that's what's here for you. that's what's here...}
<A>__{rodney settles himself down and takes a few deep breaths as jimmy begins zooming out. uncle rodney lights a cigarette to calm himself. jimmy keeps filming, not knowing whether rodney is finished or just taking a break. camera shuts down.}
