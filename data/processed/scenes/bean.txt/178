<A>__{the t.v. a morning kids show blares out. a huge wardrobe stands four feet away from a wall. there is a string tied to one of it's door handles, stretching out of shot. the wardrobe seems to be leaning backwards at an angel. it rocks slightly and creaks. (feature its padlock). there is a folded ironing board balanced over a roll of hall carpet, see saw fashion. one end of it is wedged under the wardrobe. bean's g.p.o. phone rings on the table and it's vibrations cause the bust of beethoven to fall over the edge of the table. it lands on the end of the ironing board. the wardrobe groans as it is set off balance and falls against the wall with a heavy thump! and raising of dust. the string tied to its handle becomes taut.}
