<L>__{exterior clifford mansion afternoon}
<A>__{marie stumbles down the lawns, past the semi clad partygoers, in a daze, as she takes hits from the bottle of champagne. jenny and the dive team wait by the dock, and welcome their lost sheep with open arms.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{so? did you get the key? are you blue bay's richest bitch?}
<A>__{marie's thoughts are drowned out by the roar of a powerful engine. all attention turns to a rusted motorcycle as it streaks across the verdant lawns, leaving a spray of mud in its wake. and atop the bike... elena, in skintight leathers.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{holy shit, who invited her?}
<A>__{marie's slightly drunken eyes narrow. elena brings the bike to a screeching halt inches from the surprised guests. the ultimate partycrasher...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{this is a private party...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{don't mind me. i ain't here for your stupid party.}
<A>__{she's striding towards the mansion, towards jay who's standing at the patio doors, an exquisitely wrapped present in his hands.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{get the hell outta here! now!}
<A>__{marie stumbles after elena, grabbing her from behind, holding her back. there's a tense moment before...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{damn girl, whattcha been drinking?}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{stay away from my stepfather!}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{make me...}
<A>__{and that's it. marie lashes out with a haymaker punch. connects on elena's jaw and she goes reeling back. but it's ignited the street fighter in her, and she comes roaring back into the fray, ramming into marie and together they tumble to the ground... the crowds gather to watch the cat fight, in equal parts appalled and aroused. it's a hair pulling, teeth gnashing, make up smearing wrestling match, no holds barred. the drunken marie has the upper hand, the alcohol fueling her rage.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{what the hell's going on here?}
<A>__{and that stops the fight right there and then. marie looks up to see a red faced jay standing over her.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{this...trash is just looking for a meal ticket...}
<A>__{elena gets to her feet, licks the blood from her split lip.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{mr. clifford. betcha proud of little marie now, huh?}
<A>__{he hauls marie to her feet, thrusts her towards the mansion.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{party's over.}
<A>__{groans from the crowd, but jay's mind is made up.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{but...what about...my present...}
<A>__{jay's already walking away.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i'm going to the condos. sleep it off, whydontcha?}
<A>__{elena watches jay stride away, like a lioness stalking her prey...}
