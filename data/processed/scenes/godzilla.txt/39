<L>__{exterior the groucho same day}
<A>__{the captain, jules, hasn't noticed a thing as he lays on his deck tanning himself, a boom abox blaring next to him. suddenly thud. the ship jolts for a second. jules slides and bangs his head into the boom box. he yelps.}
<C>__{deck hand}
<D>__{the nets are full!}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{then bring 'em in!}
<C>__{deck hand}
<D>__{we can't. she won't budge!}
<A>__{jules gets up to move aft when thud, again the ship}
<B>__{rocks. all three boats slow to a crawl}
<A>__{arthur tries to gun his engine but it only whines. soon all three boats stop dead. nothing but quiet for a long beat.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what is going on?}
<A>__{then with another jolt all three boats begin to move backwards, dragged by their own nets !}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{she's going sternway!}
<C>__{first mate}
<D>__{what the hell did we catch?}
<A>__{the three boats begin to pick up speed, moving backwards in the water. water splashes up into the boats, winches begin to crack under the building pressure. the boats begin to move incredibly fast backwards. things on the boat begin to break and crash down onto the decks of the ships.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{cut us free! cut the nets!}
<A>__{the same cry is heard on all three boats. leonard grabs an axe and starts hacking away at the tow lines. jules and his deck hands do the same. wire sheers are brought out for the larger cables connected to the nets. desperately they try and free themselves as their boats are dragged helplessly backwards.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(screaming at his men)}
<D>__{cut the damned cables!}
<A>__{a cable snaps! jules falls backward as the cables and ropes are either cut or snapped from the pressure. their boat stops. another cable snaps! leonard and his crew tumble to the deck as their boat is freed.}
<B>__{the harpo}
<A>__{is not so fortunate. the lone boat dragged backwards, faster now without the weight of the other boats. then suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get pulled down, dipping into the water. with an unstoppable force the harpo gets pulled under water. deck hands leap off the boat as the top cabin is crushed as the entire ship slowly}
<B>__{disappears beneath the sea .}
<A>__{for a moment all is quiet. no one can believe what just happened. hearts pounding, catching their breath. then with a whoosh of air pressure, the harpo bursts out of the water. with a gigantic splash, the boat flops on its side and capsizes. the waters calm, but the nerves of jules and leonard don't.}
