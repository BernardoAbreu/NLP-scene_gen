<A>__{joan, a solid but slovenly woman in her late 30s, walks up to mark's front door, takes a key from her purse and lets herself in.}
<L>__{interior mark's place. day}
<A>__{she comes in.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{mark does not immediately acknowledge her.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you're late.}
<B>__{a little later}
<A>__{the center of the iron lung, basically a thin mattress, has been slid out, and joan is in the process of giving mark a bed bath. he is frail and helpless. there is a look of resentment in his eyes as this apparently unfeeling woman exercises total control over him, at least temporarily.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{joan i swear this was one crazy bitch who'd swing me about enough to scare me, but careful enough so she could say: "now what was all the yelling about? you polios are screamers. always were." i didn't say a word, but typed my skinny novel in my head, and thought about revenge.}
<A>__{in the course of washing his private parts, mark has an involuntary erection. joan gives him a shriveling look. he feels belittled and humiliated.}
<B>__{a little later}
<A>__{mark is on his side, his trousers are on and she is buttoning up a bright red shirt. it is an awkward business. they do it in silence, avoiding eye contact as much as possible.}
