<L>__{exterior bar day}
<A>__{the two men leave the bar on a dingy side street. it is cold outside. christmas lights seem ludicrous dangling in the bar's front window. paul looks at them and smiles.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{merry christmas.}
<A>__{paul steps into the street and walks to the driver's side of his car. he pulls out his keys and opens the door. jacob looks down on the sidewalk and notices a dime.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{goddamn, this is my lucky day.}
<A>__{he bends down to pick it up. paul inserts the key into the ignition and steps on the gas. he turns the key. the car explodes. pieces of metal and flesh fly into the air. jacob sprawls out flat on the ground as the debris hurls above him. he covers his head.}
