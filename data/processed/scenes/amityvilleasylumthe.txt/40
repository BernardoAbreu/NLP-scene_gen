<A>__{lisa follows delaney into the communal area of ward b. the walls are white and clinical. various patients are scattered across the room, each with a look of resignation in their eyes. many stare blankly out of the window.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{this is ward b, one of two wards you'll be responsible for cleaning each evening. essentially the main duties will be emptying the bins, hoovering the carpeted areas and mopping the hallways. the patients in here are category b. they're mainly people who have had nervous breakdowns and those who are catatonic. they're harmless. like missus hardesty here.}
<A>__{delaney and lisa walk over to an old woman who is sat still in the chair. her eyes are open yet she appears lifeless.}

<D>__{hello missus hardesty.}
<A>__{no response or acknowledgement of other people's presence.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{she hasn't spoken a word in all her time here. the orderlies just lift her from the bedroom to the day room and back again every day.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{why did you just talk to her?}
<C>__{delaney}
