<L>__{interior lyn's hotel room later}
<A>__{bob and lyn are talking, passing a bottle of scotch backwards and forwards between them. both are drunk.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{okay. let me ask you something. what color were the chairs in the hotel bar?}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{uh...?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{you were in there for hours. what color were the chairs?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{um...brown?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{they were green. how many lights are there in this room?}
<A>__{bob starts to look around.}
<C>__{lyn cassady }
<D>__{a super soldier wouldn't need to look. he would just know.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{a super soldier?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{a jedi warrior. he would know where all the lights were. he could walk through a room and tell you how many power outlets there were. people are walking around with their eyes closed. at level one we were trained to instantly absorb all details.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what's a jedi warrior?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{you're looking at one.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you're a jedi warrior?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{that's correct.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what does that...? i don't think i...}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<P>__{(patiently)}
<D>__{i'm sergeant first class lyn cassady, special forces, retired. in the eighties i was trained at fort bragg in a secret initiative code named project jedi. the objective of the project was to create super soldiers.}
<C>__{lyn cassady }
<D>__{soldiers with super powers. we were the first generation of the new earth army.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you've got super powers?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{that's correct.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{hold on, let me...let me just...}
<A>__{he takes out his notebook, fumbling, trying to get into journalist mode.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{okay, so, so you're saying you were a psychic spy, like lacey?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{we prefer the term remote viewer.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{how does that work?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{different jedi had different techniques. mel landau used to visualize packing all his cares and worries in a little suitcase, to clear his mind. steve cuttle used to read bible verse...}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what about you?}
<A>__{lyn thinks about it.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{well, i find drinking helps. also if i'm listening to classic rock music.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{yeah? (beat) like who?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{i like boston. boston usually works.}
<A>__{bob jots this down in the notebook.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(writing)}
<D>__{what other powers did you practise?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{invisibility.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{invisibility?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{yup. that was level three.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{actual invisibility?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{well...yeah, that was the goal. but after a while we adapted it to just finding a way of not being seen. when you understand the, the linkage between observation and reality, you learn to dance with invisibility.}
<A>__{bob tries to follow this.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{like camouflage?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{it's not like camouflage. we also practised phasing. crossing from particle to wave, from the physical realm to the plane of energy. solid objects seem to pass right through you. it's starts with a breathing exercise...}
<A>__{lyn makes a weird shallow panting sound.}
<C>__{lyn cassady }
<D>__{then you think black. that's the nothingness.}
<A>__{bob watches him solemnly as he continues his weird panting.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i don't...can i be honest, lyn? i don't know what to make of this. i don't know what to say. this is amazing stuff. (beat) how would you...i wanna...could i write a story about this?}
<A>__{lyn stops panting, takes a swig of whiskey, stares at the bottle, suddenly taciturn.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{not going to happen.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{no, but see, i've been looking for a story lyn. i was going to write about the re build contracts but this...this is even better and i...}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{not going to happen.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{all i'm saying is we could talk some more tomorrow and...}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{i'm shipping out tomorrow.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you're going home?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{going to iraq. there's this factory we might be partnering with in al qaim.}
<A>__{bob's face falls.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{they sit in silence for a moment. lyn passes bob the whiskey. he takes a swig, his mind whirring...}
<C>__{bob }
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{i could come.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i could come with you, maybe, and...}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{bob, i don't want to be a story, okay? i don't need the attention and...}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{no, listen, we could change names, stuff could stay off record and...}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{it's a war over there bob. okay? a war. i can't be looking out for you.}
<A>__{bob flushes with annoyance.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{well you know, you don't... i look after myself. okay? i look after...and i've been in some pretty hairy situations before. i'm not, you know...i'm a journalist, lyn. you understand?}
<A>__{he slaps his notebook for emphasis.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{a journalist. i go where the story is. bob (v.o.)(cont'd) i was an american. i was resolute. i wanted adversity to reveal my character to the world. and to my wife. and to that one armed cunt dave.}
<A>__{lyn is staring at bob's notebook. he takes it from bob and examines bob's drawings of eyes.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what? nothing. i was just doodling.}
<A>__{lyn examines bob something different in his attitude.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{he considers for a moment, struggling with himself, then seems to reluctantly come to a decision. he reaches into the bag on his bed and pulls out a dog eared book. he hands it to bob. bob examines the book on the cover is a picture of da vinci's vitruvian man and the title pentagon report}
