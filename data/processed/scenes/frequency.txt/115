<A>__{john takes a long sip from the bushmills.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{you ever talk to a victim's family? the one's left behind? they don't act like what you'd think. there's panic and fear. but mostly, it's like there's this logic problem. and if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.}
<P>__{(a breath)}
<D>__{but if you look real close look at their eyes you can see it. just a glimmer. but somewhere they know. they know their world is never gonna be the same.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{then you get mom the hell out. but dad, those other women weren't supposed to die. we don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.}
