<L>__{exterior wooded hillside. day.}
<A>__{we see the drawn face of a young woman. camera tracks with her as she runs through the thick woods. she is exerting herself heavily as she moves up a steep hillside. she looks behind her quickly, and continues. angle, we see a young man, and then another, running through the woods, out of breath. they are dressed in filthy bdu's, and show several days growth of beard. the leader stops for a moment, and looks around. the two men separate. angle, the young woman, who has come to a small ledge, over a ravine. she stops, panting, and bends over, to attempt to catch her breath. she looks around, and looks back, her back to a steep wall, a steep drop before her. angle, the first young man, having come up to the spot vacated by the young woman. in the bg we see his colleague. he looks down, and sees movement in the brush below him, in the ravine. he starts to descend, and then looks up. angle, the young woman, pulling herself up the steep rockface. the young man regains the ledge and looks up. camera takes him around a bend in the ledge. standing here we discover robert scott. he is somewhat older than the two men, he is very fit, also dressed in filthy bdu's. he is making a note in a small notebook, which he closes. now, the two men look across the ravine at the young woman, seen disappearing over a ridge.}

<D>__{...you better catch her...}
<A>__{the man looks around, and begins climbing up the rockface behind him, pulling himself up, hand over hand by the roots of trees. several feet up, he falls on his back. he tries to work himself to his knees and winces in pain. he looks to scott for help.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{...your dad's napping on the sofa, your mom's watching let's make a deal, and god is dead. what do you expect me to do...?}

<D>__{...i'm tired, sir...sir, there's no way...}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{there's always a way...don't you tell me there's no way...}
<A>__{a pause, as the man tries again to get to his feet. scott looks up at the young woman on top of the ridge and gives her a "hold" gesture. she stops, at his command. scott nods, as if to himself, and then kicks the young man in the ribs. the man starts, his eyes grow, and he gets to his feet.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{how 'bout that? that's called 'adrenaline'. you said you wanted in.}

<C>__{scott}
<D>__{this is where you get in. the mugger don't care. the shooter don't care...get up...or i will beat you to death on this fucken hill...now: you better catch her...}
<A>__{he motions with his head. in the bg we see the young woman nod, and begin running again. we see her, for a moment, breast a hill, and disappear again... angle, on the young man, as he looks at scott, empty, now, of self pity, as if he just realized something.}
