<A>__{erin drives down the road, hyperventilating, trying to focus on the road. she looks in the rear view mirror nothing. she reaches the train tracks. a train is passing. she has to stop. as she's waiting, the glint of headlights bounce off her rear view mirror. truck lights, coming her way. fuck. she looks at the train still passing then back at the headlights closing in on her. the train, the headlights, the train, the headlights ... finally, when the headlights are right behind her, the last train car zips by. erin peels out, bounding her rickety car over the tracks. the truck follows.}
