<A>__{she sees the approaching merc, too late, and ducks down. a hand hurls something from the darkened window. it smashes through the bug's passenger side window, showering penelope with glass. the mercedes roars off down the street. bloom reaches the bug and throws the door open. penelope lies covered in safety glass, holding a russian nesting doll.}
