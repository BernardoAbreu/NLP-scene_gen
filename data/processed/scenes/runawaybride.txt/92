<L>__{interior maggie's living room a bit later that day}
<A>__{maggie's showing ike engagement rings.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{that's brian's. he took me ut canoeing on the lake and gave me the ring in a velvet box. ike snores. maggie hits him.}
<C>__{maggie }
<P>__{(defensive)}
<A>__{it was classic. maggie hands ike another ring. this one is in the shape of a grateful dead rose.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{gill. of course. he proposed at the tie dye t shirt stand at a dead concert. it was very sweet until he hallucinated that the drum set was a blood sucking space alien.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{always a mood killer.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{still sweet. maggie hands ike a third ring. it's in the shape of a butterfly and studded with multi color gems.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{george. he proposed at a butterfly farm in st. thomas. the ring was inside a cocoon.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(grimacing)}
<A>__{it's a little "silence of the lambs" for me. i can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{he's an entomologist! i thought it was very unique. now maggie shows ike the ring on her hand. it's a gold "#1" with a diamond set into the number.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{and here we are at bob. he proposed during the seventh inning stretch... ike touches her hand to examine the ring more closely. her surprise at his touch shows on her face as she finishes her sentence.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{... at an oriole's game. she takes her hand down. ike steps away.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{wait. don't tell me. the scoreboard lit up with "mary me, maggie." ike picks up his cup of cappuccino and moves behind the couch.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life. cal ripken even applauded.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(stopping)}
<A>__{highly suspect.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{what do you mean? it was incredibly romantic!}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{maybe it's just me, but if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true. ike moves back to the couch.}
<C>__{ike }
<A>__{i think the most anybody can honestly say is, "look..."}
<P>__{(sits on the arm of the couch)}
<A>__{"i guarantee that we'll have tough times. i guarantee that at some point one or both of us will want to get out of this thing. but i also guarantee that if i don't ask you to be mine, i will regret it for the rest of my life. because i know in my heart you're the only one for me" maggie stares at ike for a beat. his words have taken a little bit of her breath away. she covers.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i like it. she moves from the fireplace to a chair and sits.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{i'd like it better on a scoreboard.}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<A>__{is that how you proposed when you asked your wife to marry you? ike is taken aback.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{don't look so surprised, you've got divorce written all over you.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i'm a work in progress.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{so? is that what you said to her?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{no. i think i said something eloquent like, "so, uh maybe we should, ya know. what do you think?"}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{now that's romantic. a proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? what went wrong? ike takes a swallow of cappuccino.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{you don't know.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{no.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{maybe you should ask her some time. ever thought of that? ike is restless. he stands up.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{call me crazy, but i believe that check i gave you entitles me to ask the questions for a while. ike puts down his cup of coffee, gets his tape recorder and sits close to maggie.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{fair enough.}
<P>__{(thinks a beat)}
<A>__{actually... maggie move to tv. she picks up ike's stolen post it notes and her wedding video on top of the tv, and goes to the front door.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{i will just need one more day to make sure your check clears.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{ow!}
