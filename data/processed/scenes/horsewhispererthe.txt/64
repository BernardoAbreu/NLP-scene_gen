<C>__{annie }
<D>__{this is annie maclean.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yeah. hello. this is tom booker. i got a message you called.}
<L>__{intercut annie :}
<A>__{in her office:}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(efficient, expeditiously)}
<D>__{oh! yes. thank you for calling back. uh, all right, let me try to explain my situation as briefly as possible... you see, my daughter had an accident with her horse... they were both injured and she, my daughter, she hasn't been able to... fully... uh... it was an extremely traumatic experience... and uh...}
<A>__{tom, sensing her turmoil, listening compassionately.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i went on the internet and found this article about you... it says you're a horse whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. and you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well, see, truth is, ma'am, i help horses with people's problems.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well, you know, however you want to put it i got your information from the publisher of the article. i called montana and your sister in law, i think, gave me this number.}
<P>__{(trying to be charming)}
<D>__{i'm been hot on your trail you could say because i was hoping you'd consider coming to new york and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{ma'am, i'm very sorry about your problems and i appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but i'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. i don't do that sort of thing.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well, if you could just come for the day. new york's only a few hours by plane, i'd have you home by dinner...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what i do. i give clinics. and i'm not even doing them for a while. i'm heading back to montana right now. i got a ranch to take care of...}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(interrupts, abruptly)}
<D>__{i will pay you for your fare. i will send you to montana first class.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(getting impatient)}
<D>__{ma'am, first class to montana is a waste of good money. now, am i being too polite here or when i say no in utah, does that mean yes in new york city?}
<A>__{annie is taken aback. tom feels badly.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i, i don't mean to sound insensitive. i understand your situation. but there's nothing i can do. you just called the wrong person, that's all. i hear there are a bunch of therapists in new york. maybe you should call one of them.}

<C>__{tom}
