<L>__{exterior base morning}
<A>__{close on a loudspeaker blasting a period song out over the base. we boom down to where two soldiers are dancing, tripping.}
<B>__{all over the base}
<A>__{soldiers are wandering around, talking, some falling to their knees, weak with laughter. some stand alone, staring with a beatific smile at the sky. as the music plays on a stryker armored vehicle drives around the corner of a building, a soldier standing up, arms raised, in the gun turret. the stryker screeches into a clumsy skid, the soldier having to hang on. the stryker roars off again, heading straight for the gates of the base.}
<C>__{soldier}
<P>__{(calling down into the vehicle)}
<D>__{you're going to hit the gates. you're going to hit the gates.}
<A>__{the stryker veers left and smashes through the perimeter fence and out into the desert.}
<C>__{soldier }
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{it's okay. you missed them.}
