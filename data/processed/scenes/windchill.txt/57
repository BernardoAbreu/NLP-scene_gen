<L>__{interior stranded oldsmobile night}
<A>__{the kids have retreated to the front and back seats for privacy while they change. not an easy proposition in the cramped quarters. she strips down to bra and panties as demurely as possible. puts on his insulated underwear and the rest of their things. he slips on his woefully inadequate shirts and pants. it's obvious he gave the warmest stuff to her. also that he took the backseat because it's more cramped than the front. once they're finished dressing he reaches up, switches off the interior light. they lie in the blue darkness for a few moments of silence, watching their breath plume in the cold air. [note: from this point on, their breath will always be visible in the car.] he hears her sigh, restless.}

<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i'm freezing. i can't feel my toes.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{me neither.}
<A>__{nothing much they can do about it. they fall silent again.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{you know, there is a better way for two people to conserve body heat }
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{dream on.}
<A>__{but we see her smiling a little in the dark front seat. they lie in silence for another beat as she tries every position possible to get comfortable. finally she sits up.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{gotta pee.}
<A>__{she starts to climb over into the cramped front seat, intending to go outside. he winces when she puts a hand on his chest to steady herself as she climbs over him.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(testy)}
<D>__{why didn't you go before, when we were outside?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{because it's freezing out. we're talking about an arctic air mass out of canada.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{it's still freezing out }
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{yeah, but now i've got to go. promise not to look.}
<A>__{she pops the door and exits.}
