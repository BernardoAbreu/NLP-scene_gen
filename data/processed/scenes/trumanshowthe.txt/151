<L>__{exterior lower manhattan pier 13. day.}
<A>__{truman has broken away from the line of searchers, on the pretext of taking a leak. he is standing on the edge of pier 13, facing the harbor, his back turned to those beginning their next sweep. suddenly truman ducks behind one of the green and white inflatable canopies that enclose the wall street racquet club. we see a close up of truman's terrified eyes in his blackened face, staring down at the lapping water. it triggers a montage of flashbacks. as usual the images all appear to play on a television screen. truman on the cliff face at seven years old, his second grade teacher sister olivia, a close up of drowning statistics at his insurance company, mesmerized by the water in the ferry terminal, seventeen year old sylvia jumping in the fountain, his waterbed rocking, and seven year old truman sitting on the upturned boat in long island sound crying into the darkness.}
