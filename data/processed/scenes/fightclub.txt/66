<A>__{ and we see it's pornography.}

<A>__{jack, in the foreground, faces camera. in the background, tyler sits at a bench, looking at individual frames cut from movies. near him, a projector rolls film.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{tyler was a night person. he sometimes worked as a projectionist. a movie doesn't come in one big reel, it's on a few. in old theaters, two projectors are used, so someone has to change projectors at the exact second when one reel ends and another reel begins. sometimes you can see two dots on screen in the upper right hand corner...}
<A>__{tyler points to the side of our frame and the two dots briefly appear onscreen.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{they're called "cigarette burns."}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's called a "changeover." the movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{why would anyone want this shitty job?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it affords him other interesting opportunities.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{ like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{in reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag who have celebrity voices eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of tyler's contribution...}
<A>__{in the audience, children suddenly start squirming, confused, looking at each other. a woman abruptly stops sucking her soda straw, feeling vaguely terrible. her uncomfortable husband slowly leans back in his seat. jack and tyler watch from the projection booth window.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{one forty eighth of a second. that's how long it's up there.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no one really knows that they've seen it. but they did.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{a nice, big cock.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{only a hummingbird could have caught tyler at work.}
