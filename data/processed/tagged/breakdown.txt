<A>__{on the backslope of a mound of rubble, a three man tv crew (field producer, reporter, and cameraman, all wearing flak jackets) waits while the cameraman, jeffrey taylor, works to repair his malfunctioning minicam. throughout this sequence, rod, the reporter, types on a laptop computer, oblivious to what is happening around him. howard, the field producer, lies on his stomach, peering cautiously over the crest of the rubble through binoculars. beyond him we see an empty street. it is lined with buildings blasted by shells: a sawtooth wall in the f.g., a ruined high rise at the end of the street, billboards in an unrecognizable foreign language.}

<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{who's running? it's good money, full benefits. i'm tired of freelance. we could finally put some money in the bank.}

<D>__{maybe it's time we took a break, you know?}
<A>__{jeff nods, looks in the rearview mirror. his pov pickup halted in the middle of the road. inside, dimly visible through tinted windows, are two figures in cowboy hats. the driver leans out the window and gives jeff the finger.}

<C>__{trucker}
<D>__{whereabouts?}

<A>__{as jeff continues pouring the oil, he doesn't notice the mud streaked dodge ram pickup pulling up to the pumps behind him. the driver, earl, climbs out. the other man remains in the cab with the smoked windows rolled up. earl is a beefy man about jeff's age. he wears a sweat stained western hat, cowboy boots and a t shirt with the sleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps. he saunters over to the cherokee, stands there a beat, looking over jeff's shoulder. jeff senses something behind him, turns. his eyes widen as he sees earl, recognizes the pickup as the one he nearly hit a few minutes before. earl stares at him, unsmiling.}

<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{nice car.}
<A>__{jeff is in an awkward position. he's got a half full upside down bottle of oil in his hands. if he lifts it now, he'll spill on the engine. he turns his gaze back to the engine, decides to keep pouring.}

<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{is that right?}
<A>__{the oil bottle empties out. relieved, jeff pulls it away and screws back on the crankcase cap. he shuts the hood with a thunk and moves around to the side of the car to remove the gas nozzle from the tank. earl blocks his path.}

<D>__{nothing. guy in the truck. thinks i tried to hit him.}

<C>__{red}

<A>__{a stray bullet slices the hydraulic brake line running to the trailer. the hose hisses and whips through the air!}

<B>__{in cadillac}
<A>__{flanking the peterbilt, al glances to the side and sees the trailer come untethered from the cab. now the trailer is an unguided missile, weaving drunkenly back and forth across the blacktop. al tries to swerve away. the trailer streaks toward him. al slams on the brakes, screaming!}
<B>__{highway}
<A>__{the trailer piles into the cadillac. there is a huge impact as trailer and cadillac are reduced to scrap metal! and just as this is happening...}

<B>__{highway}
<A>__{the peterbilt and ford fly onto the bridge. the big truck glances off a railing. the vehicles suddenly come unlocked. the ford plows into the concrete railing with a crash! the peterbilt creams it from behind and caroms away, skidding the length of the bridge before smacking the opposite railing!}
<B>__{inside road}
<A>__{jeff grimaces. in front of them, the concrete railing has broken away. debris falls 300 feet to the bottom of the gorge. the ford's right front tire hangs in the air. jeff looks at amy. she looks wildly adrenalated, eyes wide.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you all right?}
<A>__{amy looks back at him. she expels a long breath and nods. jeff forces his upper body through the driver's window and looks over the ford's roof at the peterbilt. jeff's pov peterbilt it's facing them, 50 yards away on the bridge. the engine is dead. steam hisses from the crumpled radiator. one tire is shredded. there is blood on the broken windshield.}
<B>__{back to jeff}

<D>__{i mean i can't get out!}
<A>__{jeff blinks. he climbs out of the ford, runs around to amy's side and yanks the door. it comes open with a creak of metal. behind jeff on the bridge, a motor kicks over. he whirls. jeff's pov peterbilt exhaust belches from the smokestacks. red is behind the wheel. his face is covered with blood. he stares hatefully. with a rasp of gears, the peterbilt lurches forward.}

<B>__{on bridge}
<A>__{the truck is no longer hitting the ford squarely. instead, the peterbilt's right front tire is riding up and over the cargo bed, crushing the left side of the ford under its massive weight.}

<A>__{he headbutts jeff viciously crack! blood erupts from jeff's nose and mouth. red is about to deliver another blow when... ... the windshield falls away! the loose items in the cab plummet 300 feet to the canyon floor below. jeff drops through the windshield opening. he clings to the center support column. his legs dangle over the hood. red slips through the opening, his hand locking on the steering wheel at the last instant. the windshield sails away into the gorge.}

<B>__{on bridge}
