<A>__{surprisingly clear video shot with a long night vision lens. todd ford exits the 24 hour gym, gets in his car.}
<T>__{widen to:}
<A>__{the director, grace, reynaud and laval watch the video on the tv. director gillet turns it off. he is not in a good mood and that has laval and reynaud on edge.}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{we could have had him this morning.}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{director, please. we are getting close. the hairs recovered from the apartment match the hairs recovered at the crime scene on ford's body. we found hours of video like that of the victim. he has been following him, filming him for weeks. he tapped his phone and has recordings of ford's calls. even a cd with copies of mr. ford's e mail folders.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{with that much detail, you could become anyone.}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{so he hunts people and wears their lives as a kind of trophy.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{more like a kind of camouflage.}
<C>__{director gillet}
<D>__{what's his real name?}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{we know what he looks like, we have his fingerprints, we know what he had for breakfast. but his name eludes us still.}
<C>__{director gillet}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{find it, laval. find him.}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{laval and reynaud quickly exit. grace stays.}
