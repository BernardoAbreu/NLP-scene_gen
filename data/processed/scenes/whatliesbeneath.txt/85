<L>__{interior norman's study day}
<A>__{norman finds claire seated on his desk, her legs spread.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i take it your not mad at me.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{wouldn't go that far.}
<A>__{she grabs his belt and pulls him into her, then holds the apple to his mouth. norman tentatively takes a bite. she mashes it slowly into his mouth until he recoils slightly.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(mouth full)}
<D>__{okay...}
<A>__{when he chews the huge bite, a glistening drop of juice runs down his chin. claire leans forward and licks it off.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what's gotten into you?}
<A>__{she just smiles mischievously, then starts kissing him. it looks like she's eating his lips. norman's getting hot. she bites down on a lip.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{ow!}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's too rough.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{since when?}
<A>__{something about this response frightens him. claire yanks norman's belt open. he steps back, tripping over his castered desk chair. she's on top of him in a flash, sitting astride him. she speaks in a forceful, sexy whisper.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i don't like this, this...}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(pinning his hands above his head)}
<D>__{why don't you shut up and fuck me, professor.}
<A>__{she grinds up against him. suddenly, something pulls her eye to the hallway. pov the coat rack mirror, now from inside the study. in it's reflection: another claire, shorter hair, stunned expression. where she's standing...it's daytime. claire leans over him until they're nose to nose.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(tense whisper)}
<D>__{i think she's starting to suspect something.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(through clenched teeth)}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(leaning down)}
<D>__{your wife...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{stop it!}
<A>__{norman shoves her off of him onto the floor. he stands, breathless.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?!}
<A>__{in a moment, it's claire again, stunned and trembling against the wall.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(to herself, remembering)}
<D>__{"you know..."}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(rattled)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{she looks up.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i was there.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{claire }
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(flooding back to her)}
<D>__{i came to work in the garden and i saw you with her...in my house.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{oh god...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened. and when i woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't. until now.}
<A>__{he just stares at her, his face anguished.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it was last year. we were having troubles.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{so you fucked a student?!}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(reaching for her)}
<D>__{that's not what i'm sayi }
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(pulling back)}
<D>__{don't touch me. just get away from me. go!}
<A>__{he's frozen.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i said get out!}
<A>__{norman doesn't move. he's never seen her like this.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{fine...}
<A>__{she bolts toward the living room. he follows her.}
