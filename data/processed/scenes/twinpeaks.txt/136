<L>__{119. interior johnson's kitchen day}
<A>__{leo johnson is ragging on shelly. he is down on his hands and knees showing her how to scrub the floor.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. shelly, i know where everything in this house is. sometimes on the road i mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{lay off the bennies, leo.}
<C>__{leo}
<P>__{(continuing his tirade)}
<D>__{anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. to really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{where the dirt is, shelly.}
<A>__{he scrubs more.}
<C>__{leo }
<D>__{that's one thing you are going to learn, shelly, how to clean. it takes scrubbing, shelly. there is no easy way. this is where we live, shelly.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{as if i didn't know.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{i'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{come off it, leo. i'm late for work...}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<A>__{leo goes over the top pulls shelly down to the floor.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{shelly, i am not fooling around anymore. the first thing you've got to work on is a good attitude. that's the key. anybody will tell you that.}
<A>__{gives her a good shot to the back of the head. shelly falls to the floor. the phone rings. leo gets up to get the phone.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{don't even _think_ about going anywhere, shelly. i'm not finished with you.}
<A>__{he answers the phone.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{what are you doing calling me here?... no way, you already owe me money... five thousand, to be exact.}
<A>__{leo looks over at shelly suspiciously. (did she hear him mention the five thousand?)}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{(silently mouthing it)}
<D>__{five thousand???}
