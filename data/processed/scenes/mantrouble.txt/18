<L>__{interior joan's apartment living room day}
<A>__{a detective (melvenos) moves about, glancing at the devastation. joan, seated on a couch, addresses him: (in the b.g., helen dextra stands on her crutches near the piano, and beyond her a fingerprinter dusts for prints around the frame of the broken window.)}
<C>__{melvenos}
<D>__{you sure nothing of value has been removed from the dwelling?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no, nothing. that's what's so disturbing. i mean, why would someone do something like this...?}
<C>__{melvenos}
<D>__{yeah, you have quite a nice little mess here.}
<P>__{(poking his toe}
<D>__{at some debris}
<P>__{on the floor)}
<D>__{it kinda looks like somebody doesn't like you, doesn't it?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{what do you mean, somebody doesn't like me?}
<A>__{the fingerprinter interrupts:}
<C>__{fingerprinter}
<D>__{not much on the window. a few partials and a bunch of smears.}
<C>__{melvenos}
<D>__{check out the bedroom.}
<A>__{as he moves to the hallway leading to the bedroom:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you think this is someone i know?}
<C>__{melvenos}
<D>__{let's explore that. have you had any recent trouble with anyone?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{helen hobbles into view, seating herself in a nearby chair.}
<C>__{melvenos}
<D>__{anyone whose displeasure you might've incurred in some way?}
<A>__{now thoroughly paranoid, she frowns down at the carpet, scanning her memory for the commission of some past offense.}
<C>__{melvenos }
<D>__{for instance, just the other day we had a homicide concerning a dispute over a parking space.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{who could it be?}
<C>__{melvenos}
<D>__{you're not married, i take it.}
<A>__{her mind is still off searching for enemies and she fails to respond:}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{she's in the process of a divorce.}
<C>__{melvenos}
<D>__{what about him?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what about him? he's our conductor, he's an artist and not someone who'd ever...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you mean lewie? he'd never do anything like this.}
<C>__{melvenos}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{you never know.}
<A>__{there is a light knock at the partially opened front door.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{hello? anybody home?}
<A>__{on attractive red haired woman (antonia "andy" ellerman) stepping into the room:}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{hi, joanie...}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{oh great.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i just got in from hawaii and thought i'd drop by for a minute.}
<P>__{(glancing about)}
<D>__{what the heck happened in here?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{excuse me, it's my sister...}
<C>__{melvenos}
<P>__{(not interested)}
<D>__{uhm hmm.}
<A>__{as joan gets up and moves over to andy, he glances at his watch and exits to the bedroom.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{andy, this is not the most opportune time. i happen to have had a burglary in here last night...}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{oh really? that's awful.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{so could i just call you later?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{well, can't you give me one minute? i'd like to know if you got the manuscript i sent you.}
<P>__{(squinting at helen)}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{helen dextra, you've met her before.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{oh, i have?}
<P>__{(then quickly to joan)}
<D>__{anyway, did you read it?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{read what? i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i'm talking about the book i've written about red and me, that i sent you a copy of, is that so hard to follow?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{oh no. you've written a book about red layls.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{not just about him, joanie, he's only one of many episodes in my life, you know that. have you got a perrier?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no, i don't. let me just call you at home later.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i'm not going to be home. i'm checking into a hospital to have a bone spur removed from my foot. then i'm going to new york, to meet with a top publisher...}
<P>__{(lowering her voice)}
<D>__{... which, incidentally, i would not care for mr. redmon, fecal face layls to know.}
<A>__{melvenos and the fingerprinter re enter:}
<C>__{andy melvenos}
<A>__{you know what he said to me? we're going to be leaving.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{wait, i need to talk to you...}
