<L>__{int exterior qualen's jet}
<A>__{ qualen, who is also wearing a headset radio and is wired to a safety line in the jet. he's lowering a thick steel cable down to the treasury jet. qualen is as deadly as advertised 150 mph winds are tearing at him through the open door, but he is unfazed and unfrightened.}
<B>__{travers}
<A>__{is also wired to a safety line by his own jet's open door.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{more more keep it coming }
<B>__{the two planes}
<A>__{qualen's jet lowers the cable into the treasury jet it looks like an air force midair refuelling difficult and dangerous. after about thirty feet of line is lowered }
<B>__{travers}
<A>__{ takes it in and clips it to a ring at the top of the jet's doorway.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{locked on. move into lateral position.}
<A>__{inside qualen's plane the pilot, kristel, is a woman. her skill, like her hard beauty, can be measured in a glance: she's a lot calmer than her counterpart in the treasury plane.}
<C>__{kristel}
<D>__{moving into lateral position.}
<B>__{on the two planes}
<A>__{qualen's jet lowers itself, banking to the side the treasury jet raises itself. both are now flying side by side, with the cable serving as a thirty foot bridge.}
<B>__{treasury jet cabin}
<A>__{travers, unclipped from his safety line, cautiously goes to the cockpit. the pilot, nervous, struggles with the controls.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{we're right on the edge of the storm let's move it.}
<A>__{travers pulls the two dead fbi agents out of the compartment one is dressed in a flying suit like the pilot, one in a suit like travers.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{this isn't going to work wright will suspect something.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{so what. he'll sift though a plane that went down in a storm }
<P>__{(gestures to bodies)}
<D>__{ find enough pulverized bone for six men heroically killed in the line of duty }
<P>__{(finds three suitcases)}
<D>__{ and just enough of the right kind of ash.}
<A>__{travers opens one of the cases, which is identical to the others except that it's full of one dollar bills. he's thought of everything.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{we get twenty one gun funerals and they write off fifty million. it's perfect, as long as you hold the plane steady so concentrate.}
<A>__{travers moves back into the cabin. inside qualen's jet we can now see four other passengers. all are fit and armed heldon and ryan are seated, while kynette and delmer, ready to help with the transfer, are on the opposite side of the door from a very impatient qualen.}
<C>__{qualen}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{travers hurry it up.}
<B>__{inside treasury jet}
<A>__{travers, now in a harness like the one seen earlier uncuffs the money cases from the agents.}

<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{on my way.}
<A>__{travers steps back into the cockpit and flips a toggle switch over and led }
<B>__{the led}
<A>__{starts counting down from 2:00 1:59 1:58 }
<B>__{in the cockpit}
<A>__{even in the last minute, the storm's gotten worse the plane is flying right into the blackest center of it. the pilot looks more panicked than ever.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{that charge is going to blow both engines the plane'll go down like a rock, so clip yourself on to the end of the cable with the money as soon as i get over.}
<P>__{(an afterthought)}
<D>__{and make sure you bring the right cases.}
<A>__{travers heads back into the cabin and hooks his harness to the cable between the planes.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(into the headset)}
<D>__{dip the plane. i'm coming over.}
<A>__{the jets long shot qualen's jet dips down so there's a sharp incline travers starts the slide down, zipping in seconds across into qualen's jet where he's pulled in and unclipped by qualen.}
<C>__{qualen}
<P>__{(shouting over the wind)}
<D>__{why didn't you send the money over?}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(shouting too)}
<D>__{somehow, i didn't think you'd have waited for me if i'd sent it first.}
<A>__{qualen smiles in reply. no. maybe he wouldn't.}
<B>__{in the treasury plane cockpit}
<A>__{the pilot locks the controls and rushes back to the cabin.}
<B>__{the led}

<B>__{in the treasury plane cabin}
<A>__{the pilot gathers the cases and uses their cuffs to attach them to the cable but as he steps past the bodies of }
<B>__{the agents}
<A>__{matheson's eyes open he's not dead yet.}
<B>__{in the cabin}
<A>__{the pilot clicks the last of the three cases onto the cable and is about to put his harness on but behind him, matheson shakily crawls to his feet, draws his gun, and shoots the pilot in the back twice.}
<B>__{the pilot}
<A>__{drops out of the plane, flailing if he's screaming, we can't hear it over the howling of the storm in qualen's jet qualen and travers are watching the whole plan unravel }
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(shouting to cockpit)}
<D>__{get underneath the jet! the cases will slide over!}
<A>__{the jets long shot qualen's jet sharply dips down and the cases start to slide over but at the same time }
<B>__{inside the treasury jet}
<A>__{matheson, groggy, holds onto the doorway and fires a full clip from his automatic at qualen's jet and}
<B>__{the led}
<A>__{counts down 0:02 0:01 0:00 and the treasury jet's engines are destroyed as the charge detonates the jets long shot as promised, the treasury jet is now plummetting as if it had no wings at all, levelling the angle between the planes the cases dangle precariously on the wire inside qualen's jet}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{lower! get underneath it!}
<B>__{inside treasury jet}
<A>__{matheson struggles to the cockpit and gets behind the controls as if that's going to do any good the jets long shot qualen's jet is deliberately racing the disabled treasury jet down, but it's hopeless there's no way to get underneath the falling jet long enough for the cases to slide over. inside qualen's jet kristel isn't quite panicked. yet.}
<C>__{kristel}
<D>__{it's dragging us down! disconnect the cable!}
