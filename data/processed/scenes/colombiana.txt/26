<L>__{interior dormitory evening}
<A>__{three dozen girls of all ages go about their business. some do homework on their beds, others do their hair, dance, run around. and suddenly, at the sound of a door opening, they all stop and look in the same direction at cat and the monitor}
<C>__{monitor}
<D>__{girls, this is your new classmate. please welcome her and show her the ropes.}
<P>__{(to cat)}
<D>__{wake up is at seven. sweet dreams.}
<A>__{she exits. all the girls stare at cat. no one makes a move. in the silence, you can hear a pin drop, until... the biggest girl in the dorm, a head taller than everyone, and twenty pounds heavier, with bully written all over her face, saunters down the aisle right towards cat. her name is...}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{i'm sherri. and you are?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{very tired.}
<A>__{the girls all around twitter. sherri looks back at them, no good rising on her smirking face.}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{well, 'very tired', i'm sure you want to lay down and rest your little head?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{there's your bed...}
<A>__{she points halfway down the aisle to an empty bed. cat is about to walk towards it, when sherri puts a beefy hand in her chest.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{but it's gonna cost you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{twenty dollars.}
<A>__{cat looks at sherri. looks at the other girls all hanging on every word, waiting to see what jumps off. cat considers, then reaches into her jumper and extracts the twenty dollars the headmisstress gave her. hands it over to sherri.}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{a week. peace has it's price, y'know what i'm saying?}
<A>__{cat says nothing, just stares at sherri.}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{are we clear on that?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{twenty dollars a week.}
<A>__{sherri opens her sweatshirt to reveal a fanny pack. she unzips it, puts cat's twenty in with a wad of other twenties.}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{we got a smart one!}
<A>__{the other girls hoot and whistle. sherri removes her hand from cat's chest.}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{you can go now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{in peace.}
<A>__{cat still says nothing. she walks up the aisle past all the other girls, who remain silent. it is only after cat has laid down on her bed, that the laughing and twittering resumes. cat stares at the ceiling, her hand reaches inside her jumper, takes out the medal her father gave her. she holds it close in her hand, just lays that way.}
