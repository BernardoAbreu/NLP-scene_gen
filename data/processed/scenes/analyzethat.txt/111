<A>__{ben and laura are getting ready for bed.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i don't know why you feel you have to save this man.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's my job. he needs me.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{so that automatically means you have to help him? you're always doing this putting other people's needs ahead of your own, like you're this martyr or saint or something. it's like living with mother teresa.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{actually, i hear she was tough to live with. lot of parties, loud music lepers.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you don't need this in your life especially not now. you really need to be grieving for your father.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{really? i haven't seen it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, you know, it's a process. i mean, we had issues there's some anger but i will work it out.}
<A>__{laura goes to ben and embraces him.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{it's okay, honey. you can let it go.}
<A>__{ben almost starts to break, but he holds it back.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no, i'm it's okay.}
<A>__{ben sits heavily on the bed.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's just a confusing time. i became a therapist because he was a therapist, so obviously his approval was very important to me. but is that the only reason i did it? i don't know. and now that he's gone, why do i keep doing it? is this what i really want?}
<A>__{she sits next to him and takes his hand.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i just want you to be happy.}
<A>__{she kisses him.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{maybe you're right.}
<P>__{(kisses her)}
<D>__{maybe it's time i started focusing on me, and, you know, satisfying some of my desires.}
<A>__{he looks at her expectantly.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(apologetic)}
<D>__{oh, honey, i just brushed my teeth.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no, that's not what i meant. i just need }
<P>__{(at a loss)}
<D>__{i don't know what.}
<A>__{she puts her arms around him and holds him.}
