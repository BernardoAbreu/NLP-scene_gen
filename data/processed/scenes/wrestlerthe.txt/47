<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior cheetah's short time later}
<A>__{music: khia "my neck, my back" randy is getting a lapdance from cassidy. she plants her hands against the mirrored wall behind him, her body just inches from his face.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{we're talking one of the historic matches in history. 20,000 people. another million and a half watching at home on pay per view.}
<A>__{she turns, giving him a nice view of her writhing behind. on the small of her back is an ac dc tattoo.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{we were going back and forth, just killin' each other for a half hour. any wrestling fan, they know all about it.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{million and a half? shit.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{yeah, it was big. so a rematch...}
<P>__{(smiles, contemplating the prospect)}
<D>__{history all over again.}
<A>__{cassidy turns around again. randy looks her body up and down, savoring her curves as she dances just for him.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{goddamn you are smokin'.}
<A>__{cassidy smiles a little. this makes her feel good. "my neck my back" ends. cassidy pulls back on her dress and casually sits down next to him. a new song comes on. music: pitbull "una mano lava la otra" they look toward the stage, where a puerto rican stripper shakes her ass to the staccato, abrasive latin rap song.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{who knows. i put on a good show...}
<A>__{cassidy nods supportively, sincerely.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{could be the thing that gets me back on top.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{you never know who's in that crowd.}
<A>__{an alarmed look comes over cassidy's face.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{randy follows her eyes to his hairline.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{you're bleeding.}
<A>__{a small amount of blood is trickling down from his stitches. he grabs a cocktail napkin and casually dabs it.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{got cut tonight.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{ah, it's nothing.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<P>__{(small chuckle)}
<D>__{and they say wrestling's fake.}
<A>__{randy proudly holds out his arm.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{how's this for fake?}
<A>__{cassidy's pov: a long ish scar on randy's bicep.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{what's that from?}
<C>__{randy}
<A>__{denver coliseum. billy bob}
<D>__{banjo hit me with his two by four. loose nail tore the bicep open.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{ow. fuck.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i got even better.}
<A>__{he pulls down his shirt collar, revealing a nasty collarbone}
<B>__{scar.}
<C>__{randy }
<A>__{orlando arena. mr.}
<D>__{magnificent tossed me out of the ring. landed on my shoulder, clavicle snapped in half.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{doesn't it hurt?}
<C>__{randy}
<P>__{(blissful)}
<D>__{not when they're going crazy for you...}
<A>__{cassidy stands up and straddles him, gazing soulfully at the scar.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{"he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities. the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we were healed."}
<A>__{randy contemplates the quote. he likes it.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{it's from "passion of the christ".}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you never seen it?}
<A>__{randy shrugs no.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{dude, you gotta. it's amazing.}
<A>__{she sits down next to him again.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{it's, like, so inspiring. they throw everything at him. whips, arrows, rocks... just beat the living fuck out of him for the whole two hours. and he just takes it.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{huh. i will have to check it out.}
<A>__{cassidy lightly traces a finger along randy's bicep scar.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{the sacrificial ram...}
<A>__{the pitbull song ends. a new song begins. music: motley crue "girls girls girls"}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{ah, shit.}
<C>__{club d.j. }
<D>__{and now, please welcome to the cheetah's stage...}
<A>__{cassidy stands up.}
<D>__{club d.j. (o.s.) (cont'd) ...the lovely cassidy!}
<A>__{randy reaches into a pocket and pulls out some bills.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{what do i owe?}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{just gimme for three.}
<A>__{randy peels off three $20s and hands them to her.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{you'll wait `til i'm done?}
<A>__{randy just smiles. she gives him a small peck on the cheek and heads off.}
