<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior mercy er night}
<A>__{every large city has a hospital emergency room so replete with trauma, violence and suffering it picks up the sobriquet "knife and gun club." on manhattan's lower east side it's our lady of mercy, aka, our lady of misery. er: a white lit cement box painted yellow and decorated with old framed playbills. four rows of six plastic chairs face a tv bolted and chained to the ceiling. the seats are filled with backed up drunks, assault victims and "regulars," bleeding and spilling over against the walls and the floor, getting up to ask their status or going out to throw up and have a smoke. larry and frank wheeling burke in, two iv lines, each connected to an elbow, tangled in ekg cables. two lacerated russians scramble out of their way as they approach griss, the large black sunglassed security guard. he looks up from his television guide:}
<C>__{griss}
<D>__{hey partner. your man does not look well. they're not gonna appreciate you inside.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(pumping ambu bag)}
<D>__{griss, let us in.}
<C>__{griss}
<D>__{things are backing up.}
<A>__{griss pushes a button, activating the automatic door, striking the bandaged leg of a man lying down on a stretcher in the hall. larry and frank wheel burke inside. a pleading family tries to follow. griss stretches out his hand:}
<C>__{griss }
<D>__{you can't go in there, folks.}
<A>__{mary, john and mrs. burke rush in from the street, hoping some miracle has occurred during the drive to the hospital, approach the sign in desk. frank and larry pass four stretchers lined against the wall a passage nicknamed "skid row" leading past triage nurse constance's station.}
<C>__{nurse constance}
<D>__{just keep moving. don't even slow down.}
<A>__{nurse constance turns back to the nervous man seated beside her:}
<C>__{nurse constance }
<D>__{sir, you say you've been snorting cocaine for three days and now you feel your heart is beating too fast and you would like us to help you. to tell the truth, i don't see why i should. if i'm mistaken, correct me. did we sell you the cocaine? did we push it up your nose?}
<A>__{larry and frank slow at the last skid row stretchers. on one, noel, a young dark skinned man with chaotic mess of dreadlocks, pulls feverishly at his restraints:}
<C>__{noel}
<D>__{for god's sake, give me some water.}
<A>__{from the next stretcher a man with feet swollen purple like prize eggplants replies:}
<C>__{big feet}
<D>__{shut up! goddamn civilians.}
<C>__{noel}
<D>__{give me some water!}
<A>__{nurse crupp stops frank and larry as they approach the critical care room. inside, the staff appears as if under siege by a battalion of shriveled men and women lying on a field of white sheets.}
<C>__{nurse crupp}
<D>__{don't take another step. we're on diversion. can't accept any more patients. your dispatcher should have told you.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we got him at eighteen and second. you're closest.}
<C>__{nurse crupp}
<D>__{where will i put him, frank? look. tell me.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he wanted to come here. said the nurses at misery were the best.}
<C>__{nurse crupp}
<P>__{(acquiesces)}
<D>__{all right, give me a minute. i will kick someone out of slot three.}
<A>__{larry unravels himself from the iv lines as nurse walks over, takes burke's pulse.}
<C>__{noel}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{excuse me. you are a very kind man. i can see that. a man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i can't. i have to stay with my patient.}
<C>__{big feet}
<D>__{shut the fuck up! if it wasn't for these dun feet i'd get up and kick your ass!}
<A>__{dr. hazmat, 30, steps over.}
<C>__{hazmat}
<D>__{godammit, guys, what are you doing to me? we're all backed up in here. christ, would you look at him? he's gonna need the works. what's wrong with him?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you should know. you pronounced him.}
<C>__{hazmat}
<D>__{you told me he was dead. flatline.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he got better.}
<C>__{hazmat}
<D>__{i hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.}
<P>__{(flashes light in burke's eyes)}
<D>__{better, huh? they're fixed and dilated. he's plant food.}
<C>__{nurse crupp}
<P>__{(returning)}
<D>__{we stole a stretcher from x ray. no pad on it, but i don't think he'll mind. put him in three, next to the overdose.}
<C>__{hazmat}
<D>__{he's our lowest priority now. he shouldn't even be here. all this technology. what a waste.}
<A>__{back at security, the burkes confront griss.}
<C>__{griss}
<D>__{please folks, step back.}
<P>__{(they hesitate)}
<D>__{don't make me take off my sunglasses.}
<A>__{in critical care, larry wheels burke into unit three as dr. hazmat turns frank to face the room, explaining:}
<C>__{hazmat}
<D>__{first time heart attack, age 45. should have gone to the ccu ten hours ago. there's three bodies up there mike the one you just brought in. over there, two aids patients, one in twelve filling up with liquid. i'm gonna hafta intubate because the kid's mother won't sign the do not resuscitate. mercy killing doesn't translate well in spanish. it's a sin to tube this kid. three more ods from some new killer junk. they call it red death.}
<A>__{hazmat pulls out a vial marked with a red skull and crossbones, shows it to frank.}
<C>__{noel}
<D>__{water, water, water, doctor man, water.}
<C>__{hazmat}
<D>__{a mix of heroin and i don't know what else, some kind of amino acid maybe. stuff so strong they're drinking it with grain alcohol. you have to use ten times the usual amount of narcan and watch out when they wake up, liable to go nuts on you.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(about noel)}
<D>__{he one of them?}
<C>__{hazmat}
<D>__{no, that's noel. used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. he seized and almost coded i gave him a hypertonic solution. he drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. one for the textbooks.}
<C>__{noel}
<D>__{oh doctor, you are the greatest. you must help me.}
<C>__{big feet}
<D>__{for god's sake, give him a drink of water.}
<C>__{hazmat}
<D>__{i am helping you, noel. you could die if you drink more water.}
<A>__{nurse crupp pulls on hazmat's arm.}
<C>__{hazmat }
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{she points to burke. his monitor is ringing like a fire alarm. hazmat and crupp rush over, wave to others:}
<C>__{hazmat }
<D>__{crupp, start cpr. milagros, get me an epi. odette wake up dr. stark. tell him i need a blood gas, stat.}
<A>__{as the staff crowds around burke, pulling the paddles from off the monitor, frank, pushing his stretcher away, notices big feet climb onto his infected feet, hobble over, work to untie noel.}
<C>__{noel}
<D>__{bless you sir, bless you.}
<C>__{big feet}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{frank heads down skid row pushing the stretcher, passing nurse constance speaking with a man with a gash over his eye:}
<C>__{nurse constance}
<D>__{... so you get drunk every day and you fall down. tell me why we should help you when you're going to get drunk tomorrow and fall down again?}
<A>__{frank pushes the automatic door button and is suddenly hit from behind by noel. the stretcher spins sideways. noel dives out the doors for the water fountain, snorting up water like a bull. mary burke, standing with her family, looks at frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(stock reply)}
<D>__{he's very very sick.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i know him. that's noel.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we'd better go outside. quickly.}
<A>__{frank and mary step out into the humid night.}
