<L>__{interior tudor's apartment night}
<A>__{janine dozes fitfully on the couch, her glasses fallen on to the carpet, her vogue crumpled underneath her. tudor's voice calls to her from the bedroom. it has an eerie, wailing tone to it.}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{janine. janine. come here. come into the bedroom, janine.}
<A>__{tudor keeps calling until janine wakes up with a start and jumps to her feet, still half asleep. she rubs her eyes and walks to the bedroom. janine opens the bedroom door. from her point of view we see a dark, blurry figure sitting on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{nick? are you up? i can't see a thing, i took my contacts out.}
<A>__{tudor speaks from the bed without moving.}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{hello, darling. i feel wonderful. come and sit beside me, beside me on the bed.}
<A>__{janine hesitates for a second, then walks to the bed and sits down. she can now see that tudor, although pale and sickly, is smiling ecstatically. he puts an arm around janine, who reacts stiffly.}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{do you want to make love? you're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. you're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. do you want to make love?}
<C>__{janine}
<P>__{(slightly repulsed)}
<D>__{nick, you're so strange...}
<A>__{tudor begins to unbutton his shirt with one hand, his other still gripping janine tightly.}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{you will make love to me, won't you, janine? won't you make love to me? you start it. won't you? i think i've forgotten how to start.}
<C>__{janine}
<P>__{(now in tears)}
<D>__{oh, nick, nick... i can't take this.}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{please, janine. please, pleasepleaseplease, janine janine janinejaninejanine...}
<A>__{janine hesitantly helps tudor remove his shirt and begins to caress him in a perfunctory way, tears in her eyes. her caresses make tudor moan with pleasure.}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{love me. oh, janine, you're so beautiful. you're my wife. mmm. you're my wife.}
<A>__{janine's hand sweeps across tudor's abdomen. she pulls her hand away, startled, obviously having just felt a few of tudor's lumps. she looks up at tudor's face with a mixture of horror and wonder in her eyes. tudor is confused; he doesn't want the caresses to stop.}
<C>__{tudor}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{you're my wife, janine. please make love to me.}
