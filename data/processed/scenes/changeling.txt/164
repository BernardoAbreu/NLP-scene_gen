<L>__{exterior collins home morning}
<A>__{the same police car is there as christine gets into a car with briegleb and the two drive off. the other three men get into another car and follow. the police car in turn pulls away from the curb, following both cars.}

<D>__{traffic's getting heavy. we'll go up spring.}
<A>__{he turns. the other cars do the same. but the traffic here is even worse. just then, briegleb looks back in his rear view mirror to see another police car pulling out of a driveway and cutting off the car with christine's bodyguards. changeling a true story briegleb turns quickly, trying to get ahead, but the street's too busy. he looks in the mirror to see that another police car glide into position two cars behind them. traffic stops. jammed. briegleb is nervous, sensing the very real possibility of a hit being set up. the traffic is lined right up against parked cars on either side. then there's a momentary break in traffic.}
<C>__{briegleb}
<D>__{hold on.}
<A>__{he turns hard into the driveway of a closed shop and shuts off the engine. jumps out and opens the door for christine, who gets out.}
<C>__{briegleb}
<D>__{start walking. quickly.}
<A>__{they do. he glances back at the police car. the two inside start to open the doors, but they can't get them open, being right up against parked cars on one side and traffic on the other. they run the siren to clear traffic, but it's too late as christine and briegleb hurry down the street on foot, briegleb glancing behind them. the foot and car traffic is very heavy...we hear horns honking and, in the distance, something that could be the sound of lots of people.}
<C>__{rev. briegleb}
<D>__{almost there. just a few more blocks.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{where is all this traffic's coming from...?}

<C>__{rev. briegleb}
<D>__{i don't know...all i know is that i think i just stopped breathing....}
<A>__{they walk quickly up one clogged street and down another, the police following on foot...moving toward the sound of voices, drums, and cars honking... until they turn onto spring street and find themselves in the middle of the biggest protest march ever recorded in the history of los angeles to this date. thousands of people crowd into the street, overwhelming the police presence...not rioting, but making their voices heard. the salvation army, the women's temperance society, the society for justice, catholic groups, union groups and ordinary citizens carrying placards and signs that read we support christine collins and justice for mrs. collins and the lapd: a city's shame...it just goes on and on and on. christine looks out to see her boss from the telephone company, mr. harris, marching arm in arm with the rest. he sees her, smiles, tips his hat and continues marching. christine is stunned...briegleb even moreso.}
