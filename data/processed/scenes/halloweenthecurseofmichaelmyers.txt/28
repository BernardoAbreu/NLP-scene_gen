<L>__{exterior loomis's cabin night (same)}
<A>__{an ominous figure, clad in hat and trench coat, stands beneath the glowing porch light, silhouetted in the pouring rain. loomis opens the door, eyes straining in the semi darkness, trying to identify his unexpected visitor.}
<C>__{loomis}
<P>__{(sudden recognition)}
<D>__{what the devil?! come in come in!}
<L>__{interior loomis's cabin night (continuous)}
<A>__{shuffling inside, dripping with rain, dr. terence wynn, a well dressed gentleman in his 50s, removes his hat and coat, quickly making himself at home by the crackling fire.}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{christ, what a night! not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{that's the whole idea of living in the country. i thrive on the seclusion.}
<A>__{wynn heads for the kitchen, rummaging through cabinets and drawers as loomis dutifully wipes up his muddy trail.}
<C>__{wynn }
<D>__{don't tell me that the reviled rasputin of smith's grove has grown complacent in his golden years. i don't buy it for a single second, dr. loomis.}
<A>__{loomis immediately senses that wynn has an angle.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{and in all these years, i've never known you to make house calls, dr. wynn. especially at this hour ...}
<A>__{wynn returns with a bottle of irish whiskey and two shot glasses. thrusts one in loomis's hand and begins to pour.}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{unlike you, sam, i learned many years ago not to second guess the motives of my fellow man. remember what freud said: 'sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.' or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{i hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote freud.}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{as always, your keen powers of perception astound me. and you're right. i've come to celebrate.}
<P>__{(raising his glass)}
<D>__{after thirty two years as psychiatric administrator, guess who has been named smith's groves new chief of staff.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{but surely rogers isn't }
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{retiring.}
<A>__{loomis is abruptly stunned and delighted by the news.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{why congratulations! i can think of no one better suited for the position.}
<A>__{the two old sparring partners drink to the occasion. but wynn's angle soon comes to the helm.}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{of course, i need a new administrator. someone who can bring new life and some old blood, if you'll pardon the expression back to our program ...}
<A>__{loomis prepares himself for the bomb.}
<C>__{wynn}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{we need you, dr. loomis.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{you should know that it's not wise to play halloween pranks on me.}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{you're the only man for the job, sam. things haven't been the same since you left. i'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country. old colleagues. this is your change to finally make a difference.}
<A>__{loomis scratches his head and settles down into his comfortable easy chair, amused at the irony of wynn's speech.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{even after my stroke six years ago they practically had to hold a gun to my head to get me to retire. now things have changed. i've changed. the ghosts have been buried. why on earth would i want to dig them up again?}
<A>__{loomis finally looks over at wynn, surprised to find him standing at the desk, looking through his scrap book.}
<C>__{wynn}
<D>__{seems to me there's at least one ghost that's still lurking in your closet.}
<A>__{we follow wynn's gaze down toward the open page. a blazing tabloid headline: "michael myers dead or alive?"}
