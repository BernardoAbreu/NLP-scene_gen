<A>__{the rigid colin, ignoring him, has suddenly, belatedly, realised that the music has stopped... desperately needing his friend, nilsson like a man in excruciating pain reaching for a gallon of morphine, he frantically, urgently twists his body on the floor and reaching behind, hammers the play button on the nearby ghetto blaster... and slowly, gently, kindly, the piano intro of nilsson's gorgeous wallow re commences... colin, somewhat soothed, eases back into his former rigid, mortified position.}
