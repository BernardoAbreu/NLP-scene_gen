<C>__{dr. oatman }
<D>__{why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{it's in michigan. honestly, what do i have in common with those people? or with anyone?}
<A>__{dr. oatman sits in the window. he is kris kringle esque, and wears a sheepskin vest, rough hewn shirt, faded levis, and old frye boots. oatman nods with the suave understanding of a man happy to collect fifty thousand in fees before asking a tough question.}
<C>__{dr. oatman}
<D>__{you went to school with these people.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{dr. oatman}
<D>__{we've spent a lot of time discussing those years. remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{shouldn't you be taking notes?}
<C>__{dr. oatman}
<D>__{tell me about your vision of the reunion.}
<A>__{close up martin}
