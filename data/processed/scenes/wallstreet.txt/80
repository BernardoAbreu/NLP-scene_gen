<C>__{wildman}
<D>__{no. this time i'm in for the long term. this is not a liquidation, gordon. i'm going to turn it around. you're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, i could modernize the plant. i'm not the only one who pays here gordon. we're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...}
<A>__{a strong hint of the cockney working class east and london boy whiffing through his speech and manner. the "mate" is tough and to the point but not insulting...}

<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{showdowns bore me larry, neither side wins. you can have the company, in fact it's gonna be fun watching you and your giant ego try to make a horserace out of it...}
<P>__{(turns to bud)}
<D>__{what do you think is a fair price for our stock bud?}
<A>__{bud in the spotlight. the eyes all shift to him his moment. after an initial panic, he's cool as a cucumber and ruthless as his mentor.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{the break up value is higher. it's worth 80.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{but we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.}
<A>__{his eyes to wildman who looks at him, cold, icy mean.}

<C>__{gekko}
