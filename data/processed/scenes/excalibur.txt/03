<A>__{waiting on one bank of a small river that flows through the forest is a warlord, the duke of cornwall. he is flanked by his armored warriors. lot of lowthean prominent among them. they are battle weary and bloodied, but they look ready to fight. behind them is an army of lesser knights. to the opposite bank come uther and merlin, a much smaller force of knights, including uryens, lord of gore, surrounding them.}
<C>__{duke of cornwall}
<D>__{i spit on your truce, uther. if you want peace, throw down your swords.}
<A>__{uther and the duke of cornwall glare at each other in silence across the river. uther strains forward, burning with anger; but merlin restrains him.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{i should butcher all and every one of them. merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{just show the sword.}
<A>__{uther unsheathes his mighty sword, and brandishes it in the air high over his head. the blade hums disquietingly and leaves a lingering electric hue upon the air. the marvel instills dread in all present.}
<C>__{merlin}
<P>__{(waxing eloquent)}
<D>__{behold the sword of power, excalibur. before uther, it belonged to lud, before lud, to beowulf, before beowulf to baldur the good, before baldur to thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.}

<C>__{duke of cornwall}
<D>__{lord uther, if i yield to the sword of power, what will you yield?}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{me, yield!?}
<A>__{merlin urges uther hard.}
<C>__{merlin}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{he has given. now you must.}
<A>__{the two knights glare at each other, rage contending with anger.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{the land from here to the sea is yours if you will enforce the king's will.}
<A>__{the enemies lock eyes and merlin watches anxiously.}
<C>__{duke of cornwall}
