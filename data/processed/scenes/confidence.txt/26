<A>__{a nicer apartment than jake's. lionel dolby, the mark from the euclid rushes around, haphazardly throwing things into a suitcase. there's a knock on the door that stops lionel dead in his tracks. another knock. lionel still frozen. the door flies open with a boom. in the doorway, we see harlin, an older mountain of a man dressed in a plain black suit. behind him is lupus (late 20's), dressed in a sweatsuit a pilot could spot from 20,000ft.}
