<L>__{interior munson house kitchen day}
<A>__{upstairs mrs. munson runs water into a teapot, humming to herself.}
<L>__{interior casino vault day}
<A>__{having finished patching, gawain starts painting. he turns on his boombox, and out comes the big bassy "i left my wallet in el segundo."}
<L>__{interior munson house cellar day}
<A>__{the men, having drunk deep, are setting down their glasses. pancake looks at his watch with some concern.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{charge should've gone off already.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i do beg your pardon?}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{the charge to collapse the tunnel. i set it for eight minutes.}
<A>__{dorr looks at his watch.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{well that time, and more, has most certainly elapsed.}
<B>__{from inside the tunnel}
<A>__{looking toward the mouth. the men stoop over and peek fearfully in. they again stand upright. a silence. dorr clears his throat.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i need not remind you of the importance of obliterating any trace of a connection between the vault and this house. it was of the essence of this plan that it should appear that the money had simply vanished. without a trace. spirited away, as it were, by ghosts.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{of course. i understand.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{the conundrum of the undisturbed yet empty vault, the unsolvable riddle of the sealed yet violated sanctum, is of the utmost importance not only to make our caper innelectually satisfying. it is also exigent as a matter of practical fact: i remind you that if a tunnel is ever found leading to this house, this house's owner knows all of your names.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{she certainly does.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{therefore to draw the unavoidable conclusion someone shall have to reenter the tunnel to reset that charge.}
