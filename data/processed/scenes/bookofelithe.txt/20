<L>__{interior palladium auditorium carnegie's box}
<A>__{carnegie checks his reflection in a cracked hand mirror, licks his palm and slicks his hair back. he adjusts his tie as redridge's men usher the bikers into his "office". carnegie wheels around and flashes a smile at them. just as when he gave his balcony address, carnegie is in performance mode charismatic and slick like a campaigning politician.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{gentlemen! it's truly a delight to see you again! i understand your latest excursion into the outland has been a profitable one?}
<A>__{the bikers exchange looks. they understood maybe half the words in that sentence. the lead biker named hog speaks.}
<C>__{hog}
<D>__{we did good.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{well, let's see, shall we?}
<A>__{hog tips the satchel's contents out onto carnegie's desk. books. about a dozen different volumes of all shapes and sizes. carnegie rifles excitedly through the collection. we see various titles as he sorts through them. treasure island. the da vinci code. a volume of encyclopedia. the diary of anne frank. tuesdays with morrie. in amongst the books are a few magazines. an old issue of oprah magazine. a torn copy of sports illustrated... ...and a newsweek. the cover graphic illustrates opposing nuclear arsenals over a world globe. on one side the stars and stripes, on the other flags indicating a sino islamic alliance. the headline reads: "is there no turning back?"}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{no. no. no. no. no.}
<A>__{as carnegie rejects each book with growing disappointment and frustration, it's clear he's looking for a specific volume.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{it's not here.}
<C>__{hog}
<D>__{these ain't worth nothin'?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{when you bring me the book i asked you for, it'll be worth something.}
<A>__{the bikers exchange more looks. an unspoken conversation.}
<C>__{hog}
<D>__{we been doin' this a long time now. had to make a whole lotta corpses to bring you all these books. you want us to keep at it, reckon it's worth more than a few free glasses of that swill you call liquor.}
<A>__{carnegie's guards bristle, ready for a confrontation. carnegie just smiles, always ready to smooth things over.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{gentlemen, gentlemen. i urge you once again to take the long view here. when we find this book and believe me, we will find it we are going to build a new world. a world far greater, far more righteous than this one. and you and i are going to be perched right on top of it, looking down upon it, masters of all creation!}
<A>__{as always, his carefully stage managed rhetoric is delivered with the utmost conviction, every word dripping with passion and persuasion. he's a master salesman, a true huckster.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{and you know, i think you're absolutely right.}
<C>__{carnegie }
<D>__{that is worth more than a few glasses of liquor. a whole lot more.}
<A>__{he steps forward and looks hog right in the eye. his gaze like a laser beam, utterly disarming.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{the book i want is out there somewhere, just waiting to be found. once there were millions of copies you only need to find one! find it and bring it here. and i promise you, you will be rewarded beyond anything you can imagine.}
<A>__{it's impossible not to be swayed by this guy. he's just so full of fiery passion and infectious belief, you almost want to reach into your pocket and hand over your wallet. hog snatches up his empty satchel.}
<C>__{hog}
<D>__{this better not be bullshit.}
<A>__{he turns and marches to the door, the other bikers following. the guards escort them out, only redridge remains. carnegie slumps back into his chair, frustrated, pissed off.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{might help if they knew just what they were looking for.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{not one of them can read. how would they even know when they found it?}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{so how's about you just tell me?}
<A>__{carnegie and redridge lock eyes. beat.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{two years now you been sending these crews into the outland. burning up gas we can barely spare. for a goddamn book? what the hell kinda book can be worth all this?}
<A>__{carnegie ignores him. stands, walks toward the door. redridge sighs, gestures toward the books piled on carnegie's desk.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{what about these?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{put them with the others.}
