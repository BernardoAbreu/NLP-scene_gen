<A>__{lashing in a frenzy, the queen detaches from the egg sac, ripping away and dragging torn cartilage and tissue behind it. seen dimly through swirling smoke, it rises on its powerful legs and steps forward.}

<A>__{ripley uses the flamethrower ahead of her, firing bursts of pulse rifle fire down side corridors at indistinct shapes and shadows. the weapon is empty when she reaches the freight elevators. a mass of debris, falling down the shaft from a higher level, has demolished the life cage she descended in. she slams the control for the other cage and hears the sound of the lift motor's whine as it begins its slow descent from several levels up. an enraged screech echoes in the corridor. ripley sees a silhouette moving in the smoke...a glistening black shape which fills the corridor to the ceiling...the queen. her last cartridge is reading zeroes. the flamethrower sputters uselessly when she tries that. the grenades are gone. ripley drops the weapon and looks up the shaft to the descending lift...then at the approaching figure. the elevator won't be in time. she runs to a ladder set in the wall as a horrendous screech beats in her ears. she scrambles up the rungs.}
