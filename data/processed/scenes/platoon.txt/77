<L>__{exterior central area village day}
<A>__{a tiny knot of men are ringed around barnes who is questioning a sturdy looking man who is the village chief. he has been stripped of his shirt, scars all over his body, scared. he has his id papers out, trembling, showing them to lerner who speaks some pidgen vietnamese.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{where'd he get these wounds?}
<A>__{lerner translates, the man talking back.}
<C>__{lerner}
<D>__{he says he was hit in a bombing raid.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{he's a dink fosure.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{ask him what the weapons are doing here?}
<C>__{lerner}
<D>__{he says they had no choice. the nva killed the old honcho when he said no. he says the rice is theirs.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{bullshit ... who the hell was the dink we just nailed on the riverbank?}
<A>__{chris and o'neill come up, watch. others coming from different places sensing the narrowing drama. but half the platoon is still at work in the village. we hear shouts, grenade explosions, occasionally gunfire.}
<C>__{lerner}
<D>__{... he says he doesn't know, nva haven't been around in a couple of months. maybe it was a scout or ...}
<A>__{the men around barnes grumble.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{yeah sure it was. what about all that fucking rice and the weapons ... who they for?}
<P>__{(looking at the village chief)}
<D>__{cocksucker knows what i'm saying ... don't you pop?}
<P>__{(a blank look)}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{you're goddamn right he does!}
<A>__{lerner translating. the village chief's wife is now on the scene, a middle aged woman with angry features, yelling at lerner trying to answer for her husband, a high pitched barrage of indignant words directed mostly at barnes, and interspersed with the spitting of her betel nuts on the ground. the village chief trying to talk her down. but things are definitely getting out of control. and the heat from the sun is only aggravating the situation, pounding down on the actors in the drama, their fatigues soaked in sweat and anger.}
<C>__{lerner}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{he swears he doesn't know anything! he hates the nva but they come when they want and ...}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{he's lying through his teeth!}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{waste the fucker, then see who talks.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{what's the bitch saying?}
<C>__{lerner}
<P>__{(overwhelmed)}
<D>__{she's going on, i don't know why are we shooting the pigs, they're farmers ... they got to make a living, all that crap ...}
<A>__{the woman is still ranting when barnes turns to her, quite casually levels his m 16, and puts a bullet in her head. she goes down as if pole axed. a stunned pause. the chief looking at his wife. the villagers in background reacting. wolfe looking ... chris looking, shocked. doc, possibly the straightest of them all, very uncomfortable. they are all shocked insome way, but do nothing against the power of banres. barnes walks over to the pig pen with the other villagers, very casually, confronts them.}
<C>__{barnes}
<P>__{(to lerner)}
<D>__{tell him he talks or i'm gonna waste more of 'em.}
<A>__{lerner shaken up, muttering to the village chief who is in shock, kneeling next to the body of his wife, muttering in a high whine of pain.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{go ahead, lerner, ask him.}
<A>__{a group of villagers huddle to one side. lerner, shaken, is yelling at all of them, demanding an answer.}
<C>__{lerner}
<D>__{they don't know sarge, they don't know!}
<P>__{(half believes it)}
<A>__{barnes turns his attention on the other villagers, his intentions apparent. everybody feels them. they're nexterior barnes is unperturbed, very much in command of the situation, no rage, no emotions expressed. chris has never seen such a thing in his life but can't react. can't stop it, just watches it like he's not quite there. the same goes for lieutenant wolfe, for all of them. the very outrageousness of barns' killing seems to quell all protest.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(sensing the impending massacre)}
<D>__{hey sarge can we get in on this.}
<A>__{tony advances, the hairy italian kid from boston.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{let's go all the way, let's go for it! let's do the whole fucking village. come on, sarge.}
<A>__{chris' eyes ... rodriguez next to him, is neutral but willing. francis is hesitant. fu sheng and junior are ready to go for it. lt.wolfe is powerless, frozen. sgt.warren stepping up. the massacre is just about to break. the villagers know it, kneel in prayer, mutter. barnes suddenly grabs and drags a young 19 year old woman, the village chief's daughter, across the pen, throws her down on her knees, in front of the stunned village chief. she's screaming.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{this his daughter, right?}
<A>__{lerner nods. barnes pulls his .45, puts it alongside her head.}
<C>__{barnes }
<P>__{(to village chief)}
<D>__{you lie ... you vee cee ... i caca ado vee cee!}
<A>__{he chambers the .45, the woman begging barnes for her life, cradling his knees. he sticks the gun down above her skull. chris wanting to cry out, to do something but can't! a figure suddenly flares out in the sun, advancing on them. it is elias.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{barnes!!}
<A>__{barnes looks around. they all look around. elias walks right up to him, followed by his men king, rhah, crawford, others from the rear party. he looks around. the corpse of the wife ... the young daughter sobbing.}
<C>__{elias }
<D>__{what the fuck you doing!}
<C>__{barnes}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{stay out of this elias. this ain't your show.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{you ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!!}
<A>__{the stock of his rifle swings up fast and hard smacking barnes full in the face, breaking two teeth. barnes staggers back, hurt, bleeding. elias is on him like a leopard. battering him with his fists. they struggle in the dust, two titans, their faces equally consumed with rage, clawing, spitting, punching, kicking, pounding each other's skulls in the dirt. a dust storm swirls around them, the men closing around like excited apes at a bloodfeast. most of the men seem to be pulling for barnes chris just watching neutral.}
<C>__{lieutenant wolfe}
<D>__{break it up! elias! barnes!}
<A>__{but they rool on, smashing each other's faces in. both quick, fast, agile, mean fighters. sgts.o'neill and warren drag them apart.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{you're dead, you're fucking dead elias!}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{you you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!}
<C>__{wolfe}
<D>__{all right! all right! all right!!! now break it up. let's go ...}
<A>__{they compose themselves, the villagers looking on, grieving over their loss.}
<C>__{wolfe }
<D>__{alright, six says torch this place! blow the weapons in place. round up all suspected vee cees and shake it up! we ain't got much light left.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(to wolfe)}
<D>__{why the fuck didn't you do something lieutenant!}
<C>__{wolfe}
<D>__{what are you talking about!}
<P>__{(turns away, goes about his business)}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(spins him around)}
<D>__{you know what i'm talking about!}
<C>__{wolfe}
<D>__{no i don't. i don't know what the fuck you're talking about, elias!}
<P>__{(goes)}
<A>__{who wants to be reminded? a silence of shame. the men moving away, warren, ace, tony, rodriguez, barnes looking back once, a cold glare. the village chief is a broken looking man, huddled over his wife's body. elias stands there, frustrated. chris glances at him, moves out.}
