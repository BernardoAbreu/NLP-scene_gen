<P>__{(picking up two other dinosaurs)}
<D>__{see, these are carnivores. and this one here see its claws this one here uses its claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent...}
<A>__{as grant demonstrates with some grunt and groans of his own, he only succeeds in frightening the boy.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{uh, alan?}
<C>__{grant}

<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{mark, were back here!}
<A>__{ellie and grant turn to see mark degler coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. he's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly, balance demeanor. he and ellie kiss tenderly on the lips.}
