<A>__{winters sits at the main console replaying the game ending interception over and over. the phone rings.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{hello, yeh... what?!}
<L>__{interior winters athletic office night}
<A>__{the rest of the locker room is dark except for the light on in winters' office. all the assistant coaches are there.}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{it looks like this will blow over. the girl's father is a big booster, contributed a lotta money. so he said they won't go to the press.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{he said that? the father?}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{yeh, he's not exactly happy about all this, but he doesn't wanta hurt the program.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{we're still gonna have to suspend lattimer.}
<C>__{humes}
<D>__{what for? there aren't any charges. nobody outside the program knows about this.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{he's outa control, lyle. we can't ignore this anymore. i don't know what pisses me off more that he's juicin' or that he's doin' such a shitty job of hidin' it.}
<C>__{humes}
<D>__{he's never tested positive. if we suspend him without proof, he could sue us for jeopardizing his draft status, his pro career.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{yeh, but we can't sit and wait till he kills somebody. i hate to lose him as much as you do, but we gotta clean him up before he does somethin' that lands the whole program on probation. plus, we have to take some action or the girl's dad is gonna start havin' second thoughts. i don't care how many checks he's written.}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{so what do we do?}
<A>__{all eyes go to winters.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{bring him down here.}
