<A>__{drawers in dalton's room slide open in unison. then cabinets. the closet bursts open. pale adult bodies begin to claw their way out of the different doors, undulating out of impossibly small spaces and falling onto the floor like limbless insects. cracks are opening in our world and the miserable dead are slithering through the fissures.}
<L>__{interior kitchen, new house same time}
<A>__{more doors shoot open cabinets, closets, the pantry. forced by unseen hands. more hideous forms wrench themselves out into our world.}
