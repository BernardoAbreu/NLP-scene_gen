<A>__{on the door is a small sign. "after 42 years, we are closing our doors. we have loved being part of your lives." kathleen turns out the light in the store and opens the door. the little bell over the door jingles. kathleen reaches up on her tiptoes for the bell and detaches it. then she comes out of the store, carrying the bell. kathleen locks the door and reaches down to operate the grate for the last time. the grate starts to lower. kathleen looks at her store, one last time. then she walks off, carrying the bell. we hear it jingle in the night. and hold on the shop around the corner, and it slowly turns into a computer enhanced version of itself. and then, suddenly, it vanishes with a poof, leaving an empty screen.}
