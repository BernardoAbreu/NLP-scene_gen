<L>__{interior cavern boom shot day}
<A>__{nature has formed a vaulted room here. it need not be enormous, but should be as weird and fantastic as production capabilities permit. there is an ape made excavation in the floor of the cave, some ten feet square and eight feet deep. some small objects lie on the rim of the excavation. zaius, cornelius, zira, taylor and nova enter from the outside. (author's note: the effect should be an eyeful. i wish to create an illusion of sunlight penetrating this cave, flooding it with direct, refracted illumination, transforming it into a kaleidoscopic cavern.)}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{present your evidence, cornelius.}
<A>__{cornelius clambers down into the pit, followed by zira. taylor bends down, examines some of the artifacts lined along the edge of the excavation. nova sits beside him.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{it was at this level i discovered traces of an early ape creature stage of primitive barbarism, really dating back roughly thirteen hundred years. it was here i found cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz and the fossilized bones of carnivorous gorillas.}
<A>__{camera (on boom) moves in slowly as cornelius continues:}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{but the artifacts lying at your feet were found here, at this level. and that's the paradox. the more ancient culture is the more advanced. admittedly, many of these objects are unidentified, but clearly they were fashioned by beings with a knowledge of metallurgy.}
<A>__{camera keeps moving in on the group in and around the excavation as cornelius continues:}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. some of the evidence is uncontestable ...}
<C>__{zaius}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{don't speak to me in absolutes. the evidence is contestable.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{i apologize.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{to begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. there are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{perhaps that's why they're on your staff.}
<A>__{zaius flicks a hostile glance at taylor, then looks down at the artifacts. he nudges them with his foot.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?}
<C>__{zira}
<P>__{(promptly)}
<D>__{but there's the doll, sir.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{right there. the human doll.}
<A>__{zaius deigns to stoop and pick it up.}
