<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{i need another minute. come on!}
<B>__{on our heroes}
<A>__{suddenly there is a grinding sound. engines whine from behind them. the group stops and turns. the cargo door is starting to smoke. it squeals as it slowly opens.}
<C>__{brodski}
<D>__{well fuck me. kay em 14 no, fuck me.}
<A>__{the door opens and jason steps into the walkway. but he's no jason we've ever seen before. his leg and arm are now shiny metal. his clothes are black, no longer tattered. his mask is}

<A>__{we can't see them, but we know...his insides are in better shape than ever.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{kay em? re engage killer instinct. kay em 14 yeeee haw!!!!}
<A>__{braaaattttt! kay em firs. but, this time it doesn't seem to faze jason. sparks fly as bullets vounce off of his metal limbs. jason swings his new improved machete. it clangs off of kay em's armor, removing a hunk of metal. jason grabs her and swings her into the glass walkway. glass cracks. one of the wires, connecting two charges severs.}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{kay em does a back flip, kicking jason in the chest. he's shoved backwards. boeman attempts to splice the wires back together as the battle ensues. it's massive! intellectual synthetic droid verses psychotic metallic killer. sparks fly. gunfire sounds. then kay em does a round house kick, but jason uses his machete as a shield. kay em's leg is nearly sliced off at the knee. she stumbles...falls to the ground.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{kay em!!!}

<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{run!!}
<A>__{but jason's too close. he grabs boeman. on kay em as her body separates from her legs mid thigh. chchhhhh! thrusters ignite from her lower thighs. as jason raises his machete to do boeman in ka fwam! kay em slams into him! knocking boeman free. jason and the now hovering kay em go at it again. chang! clang! clunk! metal against metal. kay em hovers up the walls, over jason's head...but jason has come into his own with these new body parts. she's no match. finally jason embeds his machete in kay em's throat}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{jason rears back and shoves his fist though kay em's chestplate! his fist from kay em's chest and wraps his metallic hand around he throat.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{kay em! get away!}
<A>__{thorgan moves toward his robotic love but boeman grabs him and pulls him down the hall.}
<D>__{kay em 14 that's the best you can do?}
<A>__{jason yanks his machete from the side of kay em's neck. severing her head from her body. it flies down the hallway behind the kids.}
<D>__{kay em 14 is that it? come back and fight like a man!}

<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{what are you doing?!!}
