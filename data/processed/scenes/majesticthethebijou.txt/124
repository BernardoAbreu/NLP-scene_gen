<L>__{interior orchestra pit day}
<A>__{as work progresses all around her, mrs. terwilliger has just finished dusting off the piano. she opens the keyboard cover and trails her hand delicately over the keys. she sits, closes her eyes, and begins to play chopin's op. 10 etude no. 3 delicate, flowing music. even though the piano is a bit out of tune, it's still beautiful. as she plays, all the work slowly comes to a halt. before long, all eyes are on her. everyone's listening. transported. after a moment, she stops. overcome. everyone applauds. surprised, mrs. terwilliger stands, and, blushing, bows.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{that was beautiful.}
<C>__{mrs. terwilliger}
<D>__{i taught you that.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i can play the piano?}
<C>__{mrs. terwilliger}
<P>__{(all fluttery)}
<D>__{oh dear, yes. you were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense. you loved chopin. you used to call it "heaven music." "teach me some heaven music," you used to say.}
<A>__{she sits at the piano.}
<C>__{mrs. terwilliger}
<D>__{sit. play with me.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no, i...}
<C>__{mrs. terwilliger}
<D>__{some of it might come back to you.}
<A>__{reluctantly, luke sits down to her left. as she begins to play a chopin waltz, she encourages him to keep the 3 4 time.}
<C>__{mrs. terwilliger}
<D>__{that's good... that's good...}
<A>__{but it's clear luke has no idea what he's doing. he's just plunking bass notes. but after a moment, the bass figures he's improvising start to change and before long, it's transformed into the eight to the bar figure of a boogie woogie beat. mrs. terwilliger stops playing, annoyed.}
<C>__{mrs. terwilliger}
<D>__{really, luke! that's no way to treat mr. chopin!}
<A>__{she stands and moves away. luke keeps playing, grinning madly he's loving it! after a moment, spencer wyatt runs over and takes mrs. terwilliger's place, improvising the top half to luke's bass line.}
<B>__{old tim}
<A>__{is tapping his foot to the beat. he turns to adele and says:}
<C>__{old tim}
<D>__{i taught him that.}
<A>__{off adele cracking up.}
<B>__{the montage continues...}
