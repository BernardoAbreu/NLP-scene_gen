<L>__{interior jenny's house day}
<A>__{edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer. jenny leans against the doorframe listening to his story. and watching him with deepest affection.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{of course, the best part was creating new material. by the time the twins and i got to havana, we had a whole new routine worked out for them, with just a ukulele and a harmonica.}
<A>__{finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and hangs it on the rack. perfect. a beat. a look between them. with that last job done, there's no reason for him to be staying any longer.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i suppose i should...}
<A>__{he takes his hat off the rack.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you can leave it there.}
<A>__{a beat. does she really mean it? she comes closer. edward holds his ground. she takes his hand, lifting his hat up to the peg. she's very close just a half inch from kissing him when edward gently holds her back.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she freezes, stunned and humiliated. she pulls away.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{don't. don't be embarrassed. i should never have let you think that...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i am in love with my wife.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{and from the moment i saw her until the moment i die, she's the only one.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{lucky girl.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i'm sorry, jenny. i am.}
<A>__{with that, he begins to leaves.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{wait! edward!}
<A>__{she finds a pen and hastily signs the deed to the house. hands it to him. with a look, he thanks her. then goes.}
