<L>__{interior mary stuart's quarters, chartley hall day}
<A>__{mary stuart holds her pet dog in her arms, listening to annette, who kneels before her.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{dismissed? on whose orders?}
<A>__{she looks up at the laundress, who stands red eyed and snuffling, with a guard by her side.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{do stop snivelling.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{the warden, my lady.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{the warden? my warden?}
<A>__{as she speaks, sir amyas paulet enters. mary's voice becomes seductive.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what have you done now, you bad man? sent away my laundress? how am i to have clean clothes? or do you want me to go about naked?}
<A>__{paulet smiles at the notion of mary naked.}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{that was not my motive, ma'am. much though }
<P>__{(thinking better of it)}
<D>__{your laundress was found to be carrying letters in her washing. not her job, i think.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{how am i to send my intimate letters?}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{through me.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{and you will read them.}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{with respectful admiration.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{am i to have no privacy?}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{beneath the charm, steel.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you disappoint me, sir.}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{the queen orders these measures for your protection.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{the queen! am i not a queen too? what if i wish to write a love letter? is elizabeth to be sent a copy? is she so starved of lovers that she must feed on mine?}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{the queen grieved when your husband died, ma'am. as she grieved when your second husband died. and the third. if there is a possibility of a fourth }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{tormentor! is that elizabeth's order too? that you torment and mock me?}
<A>__{she turns to go, but stops before leaving the room: bitter, haughty, not deigning to look back.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{they say she's a beautiful woman. is she so very beautiful?}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{i don't presume to comment on the queen's person.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{she's called the virgin queen. why is that, sir? can it be that no man will have her?}
<A>__{mary changes mood again, thinking it more politic to keep the warden under her spell. she waves annette and the laundress away.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{my friend, forgive me. you are my friend, are you not?}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{i am your servant, ma'am, and your admirer.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i shall send no more letters. i shall stay here quietly, in my prison. with you.}
