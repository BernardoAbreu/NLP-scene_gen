<A>__{he accelerates into a curve. rockets past a connecting road, as, without warning another cop car skids out of the side road, after him. the other deputy... timothy, boxed. going too fast, swerves...! plows into the deputy headlong. broadsides him. glass flies. the cop car's tires blow out as it's spun 180 degrees... timothy's car careens into a gulley bam ! hits a dead stop. hood shears off, goes flying. back end sticking up, tires spinning... the horn blares continuously. up above: the other cop arrives, brakes to a halt door opens and out he comes. helps deputy #2 clamber from his crippled black and white. together they leap down into the gulley, guns drawn. cringing as the long hoooooooonnnnnk continues unabated. approaching the crashed car. walking up, guns at their sides... two shots. they jitter and twitch. topple over dead, slide to the bottom of the gulley. inside the car, we see that a very annoyed timothy is also very conscious. splayed against the driver's side door. holding one hand down on the horn, hoooooooonnk... he releases it. horn stops. on the radio conway twitty is singing. he puts a shot through the radio. silences it. climbs from the car and stares off down the road. of nathan and his companions, there is neither whisper nor breath...}
