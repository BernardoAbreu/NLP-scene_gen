<A>__{rachel pulls up fast in luke's grand cherokee. as she screeches to a stop, the kids pile out with their gear. rachel takes an anxious look toward jackie's place. here we go.}
<L>__{interior jackie's kitchen morning}
<A>__{the clock reads 8:10. rachel and the kids enter. annabelle's hair is brushed forward, hiding her face. ben is ebullient. jackie's edgy, ready to snap.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{how do you hold down a job? it's 8:10. you were supposed to be here at 7:00. she's missed her sunrise groom'n ride.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{this is friday, her riding lesson is on tuesdays.}
<P>__{(pulls out post it)}
<D>__{i got it right here...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{every tuesday except the 3rd tuesday of the month when it's switched to friday except in april when she rides on thursday. it's not that hard. didn't you have a mother?}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(flinching)}
<D>__{can i please have a cup of coffee?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{we don't have any coffee.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what is this? the betty ford center?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{annabelle, how's your video rep...}
<A>__{annabelle rushes past her. ben saunters off after his sister. jackie turns to rachel, accusingly.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what happened with annabelle? has nothing i said gotten through to you?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{maybe you could back off just a little bit }
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{nothing. look, i want to talk to you about...well...luke said to ask you...}
<A>__{jackie's edge sharpened by rachel's unease.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{see, the place where i can connect with annabelle is my photography. because she loves video and all...}
<A>__{and...?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{she's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{...a ridiculously expensive and inappropriate item, which her father and i have already told her she is far too young to own. but you apparently want to buy her forgiveness, with...}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(had enough)}
<D>__{forgiveness? for what , exactly?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{how much time have you got? let's start with this morning. why did she run from this room?}
<A>__{long beat. then, rachel looks dead on at jackie.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{luke was in the shower this morning and annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'm sure that didn't upset her. everyone in our family takes showers.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i was in there in him.}
<A>__{the air is thick with tension.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{did you or luke talk to her about it afterwards?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{no. i thought it might be uncomfortable for her }
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you mean for you. a 10 year old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family. she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. and you think it's best for her if every one pretends it didn't happen?}
<P>__{(turning away)}
<D>__{this isn't going to work out.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you're damn right. i'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit. i never said i was betty fucking crocker. if every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third friday or the month go ahead! i have a life!}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{oh and i don't because i have a children?! the problem is you're too self involved to ever be a mother.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{maybe the problem is your kids . maybe they're spoiled, coddled brats !}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{get out!}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(holding up post its)}
<D>__{but it's not on the schedule!}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you got to hell!}
<A>__{jackie turns away, storming out of the room.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{ah ah ah! you owe me a quarter }
