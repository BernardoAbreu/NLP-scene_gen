<L>__{exterior airplane tarmac day}
<A>__{a buffed out charter turboprop stands on the tarmac as the last pieces of equipment of rachel's band are loaded aboard from a truck. a limousine pulls up and rachel gets out with tony and court, who is clearly acting as her bodyguard. she greets some members of the band and others who will be part of her entourage. a roadie has her luggage removed from the limo and loaded aboard the plane. devaney is trying to hurry her on board. spector is conspicuous by his absence. as rachel and the others prepare to get onto the plane, tony, wearing a dark leather eyepatch, reacts to something o.s. frank approaches from the nearby parking area. he is pale. under his clothes it can be seen that his torso is still taped. he smiles as tony. their handshake becomes a quick abrazo.}

<P>__{(indicating eyepatch)}
<D>__{how's it going?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{under control. but it won't be the same... ya mutt.}
<A>__{tony fakes a glancing blow to frank's chin. over by the plane, fletcher spots frank and tugs at rachel's dress, till she turns to look. fletcher runs up to frank and hugs him around the knees. rachel approaches and tony moves back toward the plane. devaney waves in frank's direction, tapping his watch to indicate they are late. frank waves and smiles. rachel's surprised to see frank, but clearly happy. fletcher is ecstatic.}
