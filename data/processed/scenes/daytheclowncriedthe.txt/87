<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{sergeant hoffman. very reliable.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{apparently not reliable enough. the cargo seems to be raising quite a fuss.}
<C>__{scharff}
<P>__{(explanatory)}
<D>__{fifty children, sir! in a boxcar!}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{i know. i know. but the siding isn't far from town. the general doesn't want unauthorized persons getting curious. understand?}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{i will get some men down there right away.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{men! you'll get yourself down there. and take at least a dozen guards with you. don't let anyone get close to that boxcar... under any circumstances. no one !}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{scharff turns to leave the office, but after a few steps he stops and turns back toward bestler, a look of concern on his face.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{sir?}
<A>__{bestler looks up.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{i wondered, sir, if you might have any suggestions as... well... how do we quiet children?}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{use any method you can, but shut them up. that's an order.}
<A>__{scharff is disappointed at not getting some help from bestler. suddenly his face brightens.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{sir, the clown!}
<A>__{bestler looks at him quizzically.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{the one who amused the children}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{out of the question. the man's being disciplined for that very thing. we can't change our position now.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{no one need know.}
<C>__{bestler}

<A>__{scharff thinks this over. suddenly his face brightens.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{sir, if i could guarantee he'd never say anything.}

<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{you see, sir, he's been trying to get a review of his case. claims he's here by mistake. i could tell him you would recommend the review.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{a man who wants something. good. very good strategy, lieutenant.}
<P>__{(he turns to face scharff)}
<D>__{however, when you bring him back here, return him to solitary and keep him there.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i've seen the best of men, after several years in solitary, unable to remember even their own names.}
<C>__{scharff}
