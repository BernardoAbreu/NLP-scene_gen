<A>__{jack and marcie walk across the pint needles towards the lake. there is the low rumble of thunder preceeded by a faint glow on the horizon. jack and marcie walk along the shore to the lake. they have turned on the flashlights which they carry with them.}

<D>__{you? the brick?}
<A>__{jack shines the flashlight so that we can see her face in eerie shadows. she flashes hers at him.}
<C>__{marcie}
<D>__{i've dreamed this dream. maybe half a dozen times. there is a thunderstorm. the rain comes down like pebbles. i can hear the sound. i try to close my ears off. it doesn't work. the sounds gets louder. the rain turns to blood and the blood washes down in little rivers. and the sound stops.}
<A>__{a loud crack of heat lightning slices the sky apart. marcie is startled and reaches out for her lover.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's just a dream.}
<C>__{marcie}
<D>__{i call it my shower dream.}
<A>__{they look at one another in the two lights. they grin. rain drops begin to fall on their faces and on the lake behind them.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this is no dream. want to escape for a while?}
<C>__{marcie}
<D>__{lead the way!}
<A>__{jack turns and jogs toward the nearest cabin. marcie is only a half step behind, laughing. from a distant angle we watch them run. there is no theme, just the rumble of thunder...}
