<A>__{the joker reaches into a big sack and begins distributing miniature gas masks, like party favors, to his cronies on the float. then he pulls out a radio operated remote control device and points it up at the clown balloon. he hits a button. the clown begins to inflate. its joints bulge. its face swells up as the compressor tank concealed inside it releases its noxious contents. the joker is beaming, a look of pure unalloyed joy on his face... ... when his parade float blows to smithereens beneath him! the joker and his men cartwheel through the air and tumble to the asphalt as the batwing whips past overhead, soaring through the stone canyons of gotham at a 90 degree angle to the ground!}

<A>__{as it rises, rises, swelling to grotesque proportions in the starless night. the tallest buildings are far below it now. finally it bursts and the deadly gas inside it disperses harmlessly in the wind.}
