<L>__{interior bookstore later}
<A>__{adam and seth exit the bookstore. they pass claire who gives seth a big smile followed by the "call me" motion.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what just happened?}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to adam)}
<D>__{i will tell you what happened. cancer happened, and you need to get on the train.}
<L>__{interior adam's house day}
<A>__{adam and seth smoke a joint as they watch "planet earth" on a brand new 50" flat screen tv. there are a dozen oversized boxes marked "rachel" scattered throughout the house. rachel yells from the bedroom.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{adam do you know where the dog leash is?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{are you going to the park again?}
<A>__{rachel enters the room with the dog cradled in her arms.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{this is the third time today.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{he likes running around with the other dogs.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{he can barely make it to the door without shitting himself.}
<A>__{rachel finds the leash and then smells the jointerior}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{are you smoking weed?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{since when do you smoke?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's medicinal.}
<A>__{rachel's shocked, this is way out of character for adam.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you got a prescription for medicinal marijuana?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{no, i did.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what's wrong with you?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{night blindness. rods and cones are off.}
<A>__{rachel rolls her eyes. seth is ridiculous. then she notices the new flat screen tv on the wall and just like that, her demeanor switches. she looks pissed.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{where did that tv come from?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{the store.}
<P>__{(off rachel's furious look)}
<D>__{it's medicinal?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i thought we already agreed that my painting was going there.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(trying to reason)}
<D>__{why can't we put up both?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you want me to put my painting next to a television?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{art needs to breathe adam!...do whatever you want. i'm taking your dog to the park!...and open a window. this isn't a dorm room.}
<A>__{rachel walks to the door, scoops the dog up in one arm and a bag of garbage in the other.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(calls out to rachel)}
<D>__{love you.}
<A>__{the door slams.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{i don't get it, they spend all day at the dog park.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{great. maybe she'll move there.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{can you not talk about her like that?}
<A>__{seth nearly chokes as he inhales.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{are you joking? do you see the way she treats you?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{she's got some kind of creative block...it's her process.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you have cancer for fuck's sake! if i was your girlfriend, i'd be baking you cookies and blowing you every thirty minutes. instead, she's yelling at you over some fucking painting. her art sucks. you don't want to put that on your wall. it looks like someone threw up a shrimp cocktail and then used it to spackle the berlin wall.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{we're going through a rough patch. that's what happens in relationships.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(serious)}
<D>__{bullshit. she's fucking you in the ass adam. this is the one time in your life you can do whatever you want. if you want to smoke weed, then smoke. you want a 50 inch flat screen tv, then get the fucking tv! and if you want to go to mardi gras, then let's go to mardi gras!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{we're not going to mardi gras.}
<A>__{seth takes a hit from the joint and hands it back to adam.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(as he exhales)}
<D>__{you're totally missing my pointerior}
