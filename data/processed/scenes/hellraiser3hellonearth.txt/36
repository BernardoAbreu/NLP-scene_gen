<L>__{exterior city streets, outside club next day}
<A>__{the sun is high. it's about noon. like most clubs of its type, under the underground's exterior is far from prepossessing. it's set in an old brick warehouse in a run down section of town. jp's range rover pulls up and jp gets out, carrying a long slim black bag. he glances round the all but deserted street and enters the club.}
<L>__{interior jp's private room day}
<A>__{close on pinhead's face; in repose, back to its statue like state. the sound of the door off opens the monster's eyes. jp enters, closing the door behind him. he doesn't look at the pillar. he stays by the door and keeps his eyes on the long black bag he has brought in with him. he unzips it. his manner is that of a man who has made a decision and is not about to listen to contrary argument.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{another offering?}
<A>__{jp doesn't respond. he draws a double barrelled shotgun from the bag, cocks it, and loads it. jp turns to face the pillar, drawing a bead on pinhead. pinhead's expression is wearily amused.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{i'm touched ... that is the gun you used to kill your parents?}
<A>__{jp visibly staggers as pinhead lets slip this knowledge. pinhead smiles.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{i understand. their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional. what else could you do?}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{he pulls the double trigger. a massive blast resounds around the room but that's about it; the 30 ott six is absorbed magically into the pillar.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{thank you. now, shall we talk sensibly?}
<A>__{jp lets the useless gun fall from his hand.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{don't flee from yourself. if you have a quality, let it define you. cultivate it. it is you. by helping me, you will help yourse...}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{what!? what are you talking about? why should i help you?}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{because you want to. you've always wanted to. look at your pictures. look at your sculptures. look at those tawdry representations and then ... imagine. imagine a world of the body as canvas. the body as clay. your will and mine as the brush and the knife. oh, i have such sights to show you.}
<A>__{it's working. jp's eyes are glittering with excited interest.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{what are you?}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{a dark star rising. i was bound to another's system by a soul i once possessed. a friend relieved me of that inconvenience. now i'm free. born again of blood and desire.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{hey, that's what makes the world go round.}
<A>__{pinhead raises an amused eyebrow at jp's little joke.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{you see, we're not so dissimilar.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{but how in god's name ...}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{god? my god was diamond and black light. and i was his dark pope. all that is changed. a terrible beauty is born. with a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.}
<A>__{jp cruises the room, contemplating this.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{how do we start?}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{it has already begun.}
