<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{it is early morning inside the hut, and the flame of the kerosene lamp has dwindled down to a tiny, flickering light. claudia awakens with a bewildered look upon her face, wondering where she is and how she comes to be there. she notices corrado dozing on an empty box in a corner of the room, then realizing that sandro and the old man are no longer there, she gets up and goes out the door. outside, everything is covered by a thick haze, which is gradually beginning to lift. sandro, who is standing a short distance away from the hut, hears claudia approaching and turns around to greet her.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{are you feeling better?}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(nodding yes)}
<D>__{i'm sorry about last night. please forgive me.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{you're very fond of anna, aren't you?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{yes, very much so.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{has she ever spoken to you about me?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{occasionally, but always with affection.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{and yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i know. i keep asking myself what i could have done to prevent all this from happening.}
<A>__{there is a pause, then suddenly they both hear the sound of a motor growing louder and louder. they look out over the shore but the haze is so heavy that it is impossible for them to determine the source. then, seeing the old man coming up the path, sandro impulsively runs towards him and seizes him by the collar.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{whose boat is that?}
<C>__{old man}
<P>__{(astonished)}
<D>__{what boat?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{at this time of the year there are so many boats...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{and how come you're up so early?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{early? is four in the morning early for you?}
<A>__{sandro is visibly deflated by the old man's casualness, and he decides to abandon his questioning. he turns away from him and looks up to see claudia walking slowly towards the top of the cliffs, directly behind the hut where the night before the old man had said anna might have fallen. she looks down over the side and quickly withdraws, almost in fear of being sucked down into the swirling waters below. she turns away and starts walking towards the interior part of the island. in the rocky hollows around her, she notices small accumulations of yesterday's rain and, scooping up some of the water from one of these rocks, she rinses her face. as she gets up again, sandro is there, standing directly before her. claudia is almost startled. they continue to gaze at one another in silence. then claudia abruptly turns away and heads towards a higher point of land. a moment later, sandro joins her again and once more they find themselves staring into each other's eyes, almost embarrassed by their own behavior, yet unable to control it. the wailing siren of a police boat resounds through the air like a shrill lament. only then do sandro and claudia detach themselves from their trance like state, from the sudden compulsion of being drawn towards each other. through the haze, they notice a landing taking place down at the shore. realizing it is their friends returning with the police, they both start descending the slope to greet them. stepping ashore are patrizia, giulia and raimondo, followed by a marshal of the carabinieri and two police agents. as sandro and claudia come rushing down over the rocks, claudia suddenly stops and lags behind so as not to arrive on the beach simultaneously with sandro. meanwhile, corrado has already gone down to the shore and as he goes out to meet them, patrizia, giulia and raimondo anxiously look to him as though expecting some good news. but corrado remains silent, then throws out his arms in a gesture of despair.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{how did you spend the night?... in that hut?... and what did you have to eat?}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{we, too, you know. it was disastrous. first at panarea, where there weren't any boats... then at lipari, where everybody was asleep... and the phone call to rome...}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{we had to notify her father.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{yes, that was a very good idea.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{he'll be here sometime today.}
<P>__{(then turning to sandro who has just arrived on the scene)}
<D>__{i also phoned my house in milan... but ettore had already left.}
<C>__{marshal}
<P>__{(to sandro)}
<D>__{anything new develop?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{unfortunately, no.}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{very well. first of all, i will have them search the waters around the island. i brought two frogmen with me... meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{look, marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{don't worry, we've got everything.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...}
<C>__{marshal}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i know, i know. one thing at a time.}
<A>__{the marshal starts climbing up towards the interior of the island, with sandro following behind. as claudia sees them coming in her direction, she moves away to a lower section of the island to avoid coming in contact with sandro. peering over a precipice, she sees the frogmen below, and watches them slide into the clear water like two enormous fish. sandro and the marshal have arrived on the edge of the same precipice, where two men are lowering a rope ladder into the depths. moving up further to watch the operations, sandro becomes aware of claudia standing alone just a short distance away. he heads towards her but she tries to avoid looking at him. sandro, however, is unable to take his eyes from her and continues walking in her direction. but seeing patrizia and raimondo approaching, he suddenly stops. a small stone, accidentally loosened from the ground, rolls along the path and comes to a halt directly in front of claudia, almost like a message. she picks it up, looks at it, then throws it away. sandro moves away and heads back to the edge of the precipice. patrizia and raimondo join claudia. raimondo, who is carrying a box of crackers in his hand, offers them to both claudia and patrizia.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{no, who wants crackers... why don't you go and have some coffee made instead?}
<A>__{meanwhile, sandro has arrived at the edge of the precipice where he finds giulia and corrado. they are looking down at one of the carabinieri who is dangling from a long rope over the side of the rock, exploring the crevasses where a body might have fallen from the precipice above. the marshal leans over to see if anything has been discovered.}
<C>__{carabiniere}
<P>__{(calling up to the marshal)}
<D>__{nothing here!}
<A>__{the marshal turns around in disgust and looks at corrado who is frankly sick and tired of the whole operation.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{don't look at me like that, marshal... i had nothing to do with it.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<P>__{(referring to the frogmen below)}
<D>__{let's hope they don't find her... if they do, they would find her dead.}
<A>__{all of a sudden, claudia breaks out into tears. patrizia doesn't say a word. she just lets claudia cry, knowing it will do her good. sandro comes over and as soon as claudia sees him there, she stops crying, and avoids looking up at him.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{listen, patrizia... the marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... i don't know which... he wants to send one of his men over to have a look... one never knows... do you mind if i ask raimondo to go with him?}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{i don't see why i should mind.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(to sandro)}
<D>__{i think that you might go and have a look yourself.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{yes, maybe that is better.}
<A>__{he turns and starts heading down towards the beach.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<P>__{(to claudia)}
<D>__{what amazes me, is sandro. he seems so calm.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{calm?... he doesn't seem so to me... he was awake all night.}
<A>__{one of the frogmen emerges with an ancient vase in his hand, evidently found in the depths below. raimondo, who has just arrived with a thermos of hot coffee, puts it down and goes over to the frogman to fetch the vase.}
<C>__{raimondo}
<P>__{(to the frogman)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{frogman}
<D>__{an ancient vase. there's a buried city under here. it's full of this stuff.}
<A>__{raimondo takes the vase and shows it to patrizia and claudia. it is an extremely beautiful amphora, in terra cotta, with a figured design around it. patrizia and claudia momentarily drop their thoughts to examine it. then corrado, who had observed the scene, comes over, followed immediately by giulia.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<P>__{(ironically)}
<D>__{come on, corrado, tell us what century it belongs to.}
<A>__{corrado smiles, then comes closer to examine it. claudia also kneels down to look at it. a moment later she feels a presence at her side, and even without turning around she knows it is sandro. taking advantage of the discovery that was made, he purposely has returned to join the group in order to be near claudia. they both now feel between them the warmth of that contact, and for a brief moment, succumb once again to that sudden sense of wonderment which they already had experienced at dawn.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{really! so that you can stuff it with your geraniums.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<P>__{(to sandro)}
<D>__{but aren't you supposed to be on your way?}
<A>__{claudia, stricken with dismay, immediately detaches herself from sandro, who replies with a certain sense of embarrassment.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{yes... i'm going... i'm going now.}
