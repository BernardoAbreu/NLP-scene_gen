<A>__{it appears the entire neighborhood's crammed against the chain link fence around the court, yelling and cheering as a team of local kids from the nyfd athletic league plays a team of local kids from the nypd athletic league. gordy's an nyfd coach, exhorts his team at the top of his lungs. the rivalry's intense. the game close. the noise deafening. bets are going down. nyfd goes up by one in the final minute. gordy disses a cop coaching the opposing team. luis is one of gordy's kids. a small but talented fifteen year old. luis steals the ball. drives for an unguarded lay up to put the team up by three... and misses. an opponent recovers the ball. the flow shifts toward the other end, but luis is slow adjusting, devastated at missing the easy "two." gordy yells at him to defend.}
