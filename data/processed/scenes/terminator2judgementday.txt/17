<A>__{with alphanumeric readouts which change faster than the human eye can follow. in pov we move past the staring truckers, past the owner and the awestruck waitress, and approach a large nasty looking biker puffing on a cigar. his body is outlined, or "selected", and thousands of estimated measurements appear. his clothing has been analyzed and deemed suitable...}

<D>__{i need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle.}
<A>__{the big biker's eyes narrow. he takes a long draw on this cigar, the tip cherry red hot.}
<C>__{cigar biker}
<D>__{you forgot to say please.}
<A>__{he grinds the cigar out on terminator's chest. which produces not the slight reaction of pain. terminator calmly, and without expression, grabs cigar by his meaty upper arm... cigar screams from the hydraulic grip. terminator doesn't see cigar's friend, behind him, holding his pool cue by the narrow end like a louisville slugger. the heavy send whistles in a powerful swing and cracks in two across the back of terminator's head. terminator seems not to notice. doesn't even blink. without releasing his grip on cigar, he snaps his arm straight back and grabs pool cue by the front of his jacket. suddenly the heavyset biker finds himself flying through the nearest window. craassh! terminator hurls cigar, all 230 pounds of him, clear over the bar, through the serving window into the kitchen, where he lands on the big flat grill. we hear a sound like sizzling bacon as cigar screams, flopping jerking. he rolls off in a smoking heap. the third biker whips out a knife with a eight inch blade and slashes at terminator's face. terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand. holding it by the razor sharp blade he jerks is from the guy's hand. ultra fast here: he flips it. grabs the handle like you're supposed to hold a knife. grabs the biker and slams him face down over the bar. then brings the knife whistling down, pinning the biker's shoulder to the bar top with his own steel.}
