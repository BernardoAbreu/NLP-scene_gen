<L>__{interior basement night}
<A>__{dalton holds up his light sabre, the glow allowing him to make out the murky corners of the basement below. he takes a step down the stairs. then another step. the broken step is right below him. he steps again and falls. flails forward, tumbling down the steps, all the way to the bottom. his light sabre shatters. he hits the ground, his head smacking the floor. all is dark.}
