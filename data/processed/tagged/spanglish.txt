<L>__{interior bedroom medium close male form late afternoon}
<A>__{a shape fills the lower portion of the screen. it is a man's back..... a perfect back... good dark color, slim, muscular. latin music plays... a song.... if you understood the words you would hear love confronted and considered in a very specific way...we are in a mexico city suburb. the day is hot; small beads of sweat are seen on the man's back, the first indication that we are in slow motion..perfect red fingernails come into view...and now a woman's hand goes beautifully to work...part sensual back scratch, part massage. the hand cups bits of the man's back, a strong thumb probes his spine, a long finger teases the very top of his ass in a cute finger pirouette and then continues down and, as the hand rises once more to the top of his back for another trip down his upper body... main titles begin: full titles, minute after minute of titles with some key dissolves helping us to represent some 30 minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and rub, the man making sounds of pleasure. the hand is getting tired. flirtatious no more, this is getting to be work...the unseen woman shakes the hand vigorously, the man says a single sound urging her to continue, the exhausted hand complies, then stops, then the unseen woman changes hands as titles continue.....the new hand, wearing a wedding ring, goes to work then it too stops to rest..the man says something in spanish...important for us because it will establish that there will be no subtitles and yet we understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue. she replies in spanish lightheartedly, with a small and pretty laugh, that her hands are tired. we understand. the man tells her to continue. she continues, the rub now desultory and resentful. she stops for another rest. the man wants more and grabs forcibly at her hand his own hand coming into view for the first time. she says, in spanish, with no particular anger, "you said you would never push me around again. if you do, i will somehow break your arm so you can rub your own back as high as you want." (note: all spanish dialogue will be worked hard to provide something extra for the spanish speaking..working in tidbits or extra exposition, jokes etc.) for now, the man's tone changes, placating her to continue. even as she resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic argument in spanish. this is no longer a massage we envy. this back rub, going as it does from sex and hope to discord and alienation, will be our only full direct knowledge of their marriage.}
<L>__{interior exterior bedroom dusty road other angle}
<A>__{showing us the room and beyond, through the window, a school bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road. we now see the full figure of the woman's back as she looks up with excitement and stops rubbing with the word, "cristina." when the man protests her stopping she indicates they should both run and meet their daughter. he waves her off. stunned by his disinterest, she runs from the room.....}
<L>__{exterior dusty road the bus}
<A>__{as cristina, six years old and adorable, waits patiently to step down. she sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly, digging into her little pack to pull out an english book which she displays with pride. now she steps down from the bus and, as she walks toward camera, narration begins. the voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{to princeton university's director of admissions: in considering me for a scholarship you have asked for, and have every reason to expect, an essay from me about myself. and, as a clever high school graduate, i of course realize the subtext of this essay about who i am and why i want to enter princeton, is actually to make clear to you why you should have me. i have gotten tips, from friends who have preceded me to college, that being a latina, with my grades, list of activities and relative poverty, i am as good as in if i simply do the dance and work in a word like "bipolarization" every so often. and while i love dances this dance of self is one i am afraid to master.}

<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{there was never any pretense that the gorgeous, vital, clever, temperamental animal that was my mother ever for a heartbeat considered having any life of her own. she ignored all her needs and was alive only for me. it was terrific.}

<D>__{at the time.}
<B>__{on mom.}
<A>__{as she watches her daughter chew a cookie. her daughter begins to tell about her day, her young mother taking on a glow we have not yet seen. and all the while she eyes the action in the next room. her husband makes a break for the window. the other man points a gun at the ceiling preparing to fire a warning shot. the woman moves ever so quickly to a shelf of her favorite dishes, all the while talking to her daughter, making much over the kid's new school books. it is an impressive charade. full shot taking in both rooms. and just as the cop shoots at the ceiling, in perfect timing, she upsets the dishes, the resulting noise covering the shot.. the woman asks her daughter what she learned today..the daughter says she was taught a little english. mother is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband toward the front door where other police await. her daughter starts to follow her gaze and she distracts her..brandishing the spanish english book and asking her to say something.}

<D>__{i never made that sound over a man before..}
<A>__{flor shudders at her own sappiness as john opens the passenger door for her...very much into his own torture he nonetheless grabs her arm and guides her up and in..she catches and appreciates his automatic gracious manners while he is clearly fucked up...she is impatient with his solicitousness almost slapping his hands away as he makes sure her skirt doesn't get crushed in the door..the frustration roiling in her.}

<D>__{don't be crazy. tell me every detail.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay, flor, yes i will...they should name a gender after you..looking at you doesn't do it..staring is the only thing that makes sense..and trying not to blink so you don't miss anything.}

<P>__{(feigning innocence)}
<D>__{because?}
<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{mom was crying for six hours straight and grandma was in with her all that time mostly saying, "he'll be back..he'll be back." i've got to get back to georgie.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i just hate that you had that kind of a night.}
<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{it's good for me to worry about something that really matters instead of the stupid stuff that's usually on my mind...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{like?}
<C>__{bernice}
<P>__{(a big grin)}
<D>__{surviving.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're fantastic, bernie...i love you.}
<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{it's a slant...}
<P>__{(pause then)}
<D>__{hey..i know there's a lot you went through but i knew all along that grandma was right about you coming back..i mean totally knew it so i wasn't that worried. but still i...}
<P>__{(some emotion out of hiding)}
<D>__{i really appreciate it, dad. thanks....stop staring at me..what? you don't know what to say?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{right. i don't know what to say.}
<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{just what you taught me..you're welcome.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{they kiss.}
<L>__{exterior stone canyon morning.}
<A>__{flor purposefully walking up the hill..}
<L>__{interior clasky house day.}
<A>__{as flor enters...walks through a few empty rooms..then once in the kitchen she sees the children and evelyn are swimming in the pool...she opens the glass door monica bumped into on interview day.}
<L>__{exterior clasky pool day.}
<A>__{evelyn, bernice and georgie are in the pool..cristina, wearing a bathing suit, is on a chaise reading...}
<C>__{cristina}
<D>__{hey, mom...is it okay if we don't leave right away?}
<A>__{the others call greetings..save evelyn who studies the situation and gets out of the pool..flor is awkward..no idea how to handle this...so she goes direct.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{no...}
<P>__{(as cristina begins to protest)}
<D>__{no..and we must say "goodbye." i don't work here anymore.}
<A>__{she then talks spanish to cristina..admonishing her not to embarrass them..something about flor being prepared to go nuts all over her daughter if she hurts their dignity...but it is said with total calm.}
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{do i have to get out?}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{no, georgie..stay. i think you are a wonderful boy..be good..like you are. there are no monsters.}
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{thanks..thanks. okay.}
<A>__{bernice climbs out of the pool. meanwhile, a flabbergasted cristina is staring at her mom who gives quiet two and three word proddings in spanish.}
<C>__{bernice}
<P>__{(severely to georgie)}
<D>__{i can't believe you didn't get out.}
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{flor said.}
<C>__{bernice}
<P>__{(to flor)}
<D>__{i don't want to get you wet.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{get me wet.}
<C>__{bernice}
<P>__{(rushing to hug her)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{bernice hugs her. evelyn hugs cristina..}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you...are...a...trip.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(to bernice)}
<D>__{you're a beauty. amazing girl.}
<A>__{despite herself, bernice starts to cry..moans to herself over the display...now, in the background, we hear a subliminal human voice. incrementally it will grow louder and be recognizable as deborah calling flor from the master bedroom window..bit by bit, the others will become aware of this as flor ignores it...bernice goes to embrace cristina.}
<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{my last chance to have some of you rub off on me..}
<P>__{(cristina doesn't understand)}
<D>__{i'm sorry you're so sad but this could have been so much worse.}
<C>__{cristina}
<P>__{(from her depths)}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{and now deborah calling "flor" is getting hard to ignore but flor manages..}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(to cristina)}
<D>__{why don't you run upstairs and say goodbye to deborah?}
<A>__{flor flashes a look of thanks.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{i will be in front.}
<A>__{upset, cristina runs off. she kisses bernice..and walks toward the house. as she passes under the bedroom..}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{please come see me.}
<A>__{and then a crying cristina appears on the deck. flor glances up and keeps moving underneath the deck where she faintly hears the beginning of their exchange}
<C>__{deborah's voice}
<D>__{it's okay, honey..we'll see each other at school..i'm going to keep an eye on you..i will.}
<A>__{flor enters the house...}
<L>__{interior kitchen day.}
<A>__{she stands waiting..walks to the hallway and cranes her head to see into rooms, wondering if john is there. finally, as she passes the stairwell, she sees cristina on an upper landing and says, in spanish, that cristina should get her things and meet her out front. cristina, agitated, moves off to comply...then deborah appears in the same spot.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{please stick your head in here for a minute.}
<A>__{flor nods and starts up the stairs...}
<L>__{interior master bedroom day}
<A>__{deborah holds open the door while flor walks inside..then closes it.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{what's with avoiding me, am i this horrible person?}
<A>__{as flor just looks at her.}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{i know. it's a ridiculous question but sometimes i'm ridi...}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{no. it's a good question. a fine question. complicated.}
<P>__{(beat then)}
<D>__{i was just thinking to answer.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{oh stop. come on. weren't we close?}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(like a shot)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(truly hurt)}
<D>__{well, i'm very, very disappointed to hear that. it makes me feel like a fool.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(compassion forces a crumb)}
<D>__{we weren't close..but we were connected...in a bad way.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(strangely soothed)}
<D>__{you know something, i think we're saying the same thing...look as long as we're doing closure..what did you and my husband, john, do last night?}
<A>__{flor pauses for less of a beat than we would have imagined.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{i can only tell you what i did.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{that will be sufficient.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(these are tender feelings)}
<D>__{i became sure of what an incredibly lucky woman you are and i must make myself not envy you which is hard. no, it's not hard. it's impossible. now please..i am exhausted.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{same here believe me.}
<A>__{deborah would hug..but it's only an eighth of a gesture because flor has turned to exit, calling for her daughter to hurry as she goes.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{cristina, apurate.}
<L>__{exterior clasky house day}
<A>__{as she exits the house and moves to the gate where she punches in the exit code...}
<B>__{angle on gate}
<A>__{as it swings open to reveal john...}
<L>__{exterior street day.}
<A>__{as she moves alongside him and the gate closes behind her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i was hanging out here waiting. can't give you guys a lift?}
<A>__{flor shakes her head "no." she looks away for a beat so the next thing she does is a considered action. she leans forward and kisses him on the lips. john looks at her.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{this is killer.}
<P>__{(on her confusion)}
<D>__{incredibly hard.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{yes, cari..}
<A>__{the gate opens and a sniffling cristina is holding an armful of loot.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(reading flor)}
<D>__{let her have it..party favors.}
<A>__{she nods..bites back some emotion and turns from him.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{cristina..}
<C>__{cristina}
<D>__{goodbye, mr. clasky..i am very sorry we will not see each other as frequently.}
<A>__{she offers her hand, which john shakes while patting her on the back.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{they turn and begin walking down the street. shot stone canyon the women walking toward camera, john briefly in the background...as they begin their walk flor begins talking in spanish.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{the first minute we were alone, my mother told me that i would no longer go to the private school.}
<C>__{cristina}
<D>__{no. no..you can't. i won't be able to forgive you..it will be the end. i won't let you.}
<A>__{and then cristina moves her hysterics to spanish as she stops walking and her mother takes her hand and pulls her along with enormous dedication. camera begins a pull back. cristina dropping presents..picking them up..one of them left by the wayside..people noticing..cristina's conduct violating tacit zoning laws.}
<B>__{closer shot..}
<A>__{so we can see their faces in the struggle.}
<L>__{exterior bus stop..}
<A>__{as they wait...flor talks sharply to cristina to control herself.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{my mother changed our lives once more. this time because she saw in me, to her great alarm, a character flaw of some size. she has taught me to be a watch dog of my character, to control my ambition. i am not quite there.}
<A>__{one last yelp from cristina as the bus arrives.}
<L>__{interior bus day.}
<A>__{almost empty it's saturday. mother and daughter sit together by the giant window in the center of the bus. cristina eyes her mother who is bearing her own heartbreak with stoic dignity. the girl is becoming less inconsolable and more in need of mothering.}
<C>__{narrator }
<D>__{for that reason should you choose to grant me your scholarship my mother, at my request, will be relocating to the new york metropolitan area so that she can stay close during my time at princeton.}
<A>__{cristina moves closer to flor, who senses it immediately and wraps her in her arms.. kisses her head.}
<C>__{narrator }
<D>__{i hope my essay has done her justice. i love her with all my heart.}
<T>__{fade out:}
