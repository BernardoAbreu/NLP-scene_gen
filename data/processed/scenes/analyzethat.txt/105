<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{i adore this place. best sushi in town. have you tried the yellowtail, paul?}
<A>__{raoul picks up a floppy piece of raw fish with his chopsticks.}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(makes a face)}
<D>__{no. we gettin' any real food? this is like eatin' fuckin' bait.}
<A>__{raoul chuckles and glances uncomfortably at his girlfriend. ben laughs loudly to cover the awkward moment. he's suffering from some reaction between the pills and the booze and he's oddly thick lipped.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{bait! that's funny. honey, did you hear what paul just said? he said this is like eating bait.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(not amused)}

<A>__{don't admire me too much.}
<C>__{raoul}

<D>__{this is so exciting. mr. berman, i love your show. anthony bella, the guy who plays nicky caesar i think he grew up in bensonhurst next door to my cousin's friend's husband.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{that's her claim to fame.}
<P>__{(to sheila)}
<D>__{i hate to bust your bubble, but he's not from bensonhurst. he's a professional italian. he grew up in connecticut or something like that.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{well, wherever he's from, i think he's a wonderful actor.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{yeah, i bet he gets a lot of pussy.}
<A>__{laura chokes on her drink.}

<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(tries a desperate save)}

<A>__{vitti's eyes suddenly go wide.}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{down!!!}
<A>__{he grabs sheila and pulls her down as gunfire rakes the wall behind them. everybody else at the table hits the floor. other diners scream in terror. jelly pulls a gun and shoots back.}
<B>__{a lone gunman}
<A>__{runs from the restaurant. after a long beat, the frightened patrons start to get up and chatter nervously. ben's table nobody's hurt. vitti helps sheila to her feet.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(to vitti)}
<D>__{what the hell was that?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i think somebody's got it in for raoul.}
<A>__{raoul crawls up from behind the table.}
