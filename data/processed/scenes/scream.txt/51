<A>__{with first period underway, the halls have cleared. one or two struggling students can be seen rushing to class. sidney moves quickly down the hall, rounding a corner, running smack into...}
<B>__{billy}
<A>__{they collide hard catching sidney off guard, scaring the life out of her. she falls backwards, but billy catches her fall.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{jesus, shit!}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{hey, hey, it's just me.}
<A>__{sidney pulls away from him quickly. billy feels the slight.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{what? you don't still think it's me?}
<A>__{sidney catches her breath.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no...i don't...it's just...oh god, billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{the police say i scared him off. it wasn't me, sid.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i know. he called again last night at tatum's house.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{see, it couldn't have been me. i was in jail, remember?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i'm so sorry...please understand.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{understand what? that i got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you know that's not true.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{then what is it? is there somebody else?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{is it the sex thing? am i being too pushy?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no, it's me, billy. i need time. i'm still adjusting to my mom.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{it's been a year since she died.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(correcting him)}
<D>__{tomorrow. one year tomorrow.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{when are you gonna let that go, sid? when my mom left my dad i just accepted it. this is the way it is. she's not coming back.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{your parents split up. it's not the same thing. your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you have to move on, sid.}
<A>__{sidney starts to walk away but turns back, angry.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i'm glad to know you're coping so well with life, billy. but some of us aren't so perfect. some of us are just trying to hold on.}
<A>__{sidney disappears through a door marked girl's bathroom, leaving billy alone in the hallway. he smacks his forehead, pissed at himself.}
