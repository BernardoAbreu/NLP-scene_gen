<A>__{the opening bars of joe cocker's "feelin' alright" crackle just before we see whip step out of the hotel room and begin a relatively steady strut down the hallway. deja vu. sunglasses on, whip is backed by hugh and charlie who flank him from a few steps behind. further back we can see that officer edwards also exits the room wearing latex gloves, carrying a large plastic garbage bag that obviously holds any evidence of the debauched night or the morning's resurrection.}
