<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{gabe's face close gabe's rattled too but for a brand new reason we pull back to see gabe at the wire's edge where the wire that wire links the buttress with the facing tower. whipping in the wind, it looks risky but that's not the problem. gabe stares at the other edge for a moment. immobile. remembering susan's death. gabe shakes out of it when }
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{gabe?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will go first.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{if i don't go first, i might not go at all.}
<A>__{gabe hooks his ankles over the wire and starts dragging himself, hand over hand, across the abyss no safety line this time. as his weight pulls the line taut, the wind rocks him back and forth. gabe steadily drags himself out gabe on wire long shot fatigue stops gabe in the middle a half mile up, strung between two gigantic mountains, he looks as insignificant and alone as a man possibly can be }
<B>__{closer on gabe}
<A>__{panting with exertion, frozen he can barely hold his grip and has an elbow crooked around the wire for support. gabe's eyes are shut he looks near collapse flashback gabe's pov gabe is falling from the wire in slow motion, trailing susan she spirals out of reach as his line snaps him back gabe's grip unconsciously relaxes but his eyes jolt open and he clamps both hands shut on the wire. gabe, drawing on some inner fury, drags himself with long, sharp yanks }
<B>__{maggie}
<A>__{tensely watches gabe's crossing overview gabe is about ten feet away from the end gabe's upside down pov the end of the wire looks a lot further away than that }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{pulls faster and reaches the other side. gabe maintains his hand grip and swings his feet onto the ledge, leaning back against the wall to catch his breath.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(winded, shouting across)}
<D>__{think you can beat my time?}
<B>__{maggie}
<A>__{smiles this is more like the gabe she remembers. she gets on the wire and starts across in a fast, easy rhythm.}
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{watches her, grinning. admiration for maggie is washing away bad memories of susan.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{shit she is in better shape.}
<A>__{maggie pulls across fearlessly but insert the bolt on gabe's side of the wire is giving where travers had hacked at it just a millimeter, but it's pulling loose }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{doesn't notice and shouts across at maggie, now half way.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(enjoying it now)}
<D>__{quit sandbagging it i haven't got all day }
<A>__{insert the bolt is coming looser maggie's quicker crossing is thrashing the wire and straining the bolt's weakened anchoring gabe watching maggie who is now twenty feet away fifteen ten five insert the bolt pops out of the wall as if it were shot }
<B>__{the wire}
<A>__{which was tight as a bowstring fires out into the chasm maggie, stunned and without options, lets go two feet short of the ledge }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{drops low just as maggie starts to fall and swings his arm out towards hers in one lightning fast motion }
<B>__{their hands}
<A>__{catch }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{maintains his grip on maggie's hand, but her weight nearly pulls him off the ledge maggie drags him down, the window goes out of his chest when it collides with the ledge's bottom, but their grip holds. all of this in a split second. maggie hangs from gabe's arm, locked in terror but skill wins out over fear. she finds a handhold with her free arm, and climbs up to the ledge with gabe's help. maggie collapses into gabe's arms and they fall back against the wall, but gabe's the one who's really holding on tight.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{that tears it.}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{you're not coming any further.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(just as breathless)}
<D>__{gabe you're going to get yourself killed }
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(breath almost back)}
<D>__{maybe. but i'm not getting you killed.}
<P>__{(she starts a reply)}
<D>__{look, maggie. i don't know what'll happen when i catch up with hal but i've got to know one thing for sure that you're making it off this mountain. alive.}
<A>__{gabe's eyes are pleading. maggie hesitates. but gives in.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{gabe lightly kisses maggie he doesn't want to turn this into a farewell kiss, afraid that that's really what it might be. they stand and separate. gabe moves away.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{get on the trail and stay out of sight.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will see you on the ground.}
<A>__{maggie wonders if she will as gabe vanishes around a corner.}
