<A>__{anna sits on the floor in the middle of the room. hugging her legs to her chest. rocking to and fro. surrounded by broken glass, torn papers and instruments. eliot enters the room. coldly surveys the destruction.}

<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{why did you do this?}
<A>__{anna ignores him. eliot strides over to her.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{why did you do this?}
<A>__{anna stares at him blankly.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{is this the afterlife? am i in heaven? or am i in hell?}
<A>__{strangely eliot's not surprised. he nods his head. his anger gone now.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{the door...}
<P>__{(points distractedly)}
<D>__{there was a door. just there.}
<C>__{eliot}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{it won't be long now.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i used to believe in god. i thought i'd see him when i died. instead i saw you.}
<A>__{eliot softly strokes her hair. comforting her.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{maybe you are god.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you'll be at peace soon. i promise.}
<A>__{for a moment we see a deep sadness in eliot's eyes. he's conflicted. but then abruptly he pulls himself together. moves away and starts clearing up. anna closes her eyes. hugs her legs closer to her chest.}

<D>__{paul.}
<A>__{she lets out a despondent sigh. the sigh carries into the next scene...}
