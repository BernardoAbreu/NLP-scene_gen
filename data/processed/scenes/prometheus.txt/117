<A>__{they emerge from the airlock and freeze in horror. lying on the deck in front of them are the blood soaked bodies of ravel and chance. their arms and legs bound. their heads thrown back in agony. their chests torn open from within. a dead facehugger beside each body. janek plays his lights over the corpses, his face stony.}

<D>__{blood's dry. eight hours dead or more.}
<A>__{fearfully they sweep their flashlights into every dark corner. nothing.}

<D>__{this way.}
<A>__{she points down a passageway. through the engineer lenses she sees alien symbols gleaming. she leads them into the dark.}
<C>__{vaulted passage}
<A>__{the war party moves down a corridor. a hiss echoes through the passage. they freeze. sweeping their flashlight beams everywhere. ray looks up. an alien hangs above him, wedged between two vaults of the ribbed ceiling. half the size of a man; an adolescent. it drops on him. the bladed tail glances off his helmet, sparking. he jerks his carbine up and fires a long burst as he rolls aside. the alien convulses, its exoskeleton shattered. fatally wounded. acid sears into the deck. echoes of the gunfire reverberate.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{so much for sneaking up on him.}

<C>__{navigation chamber}
<A>__{watts leads the war party to the orrery. momentarily even the soldiers forget their wariness, staring in astonishment at the myriad spheres of light. but if they are impressed, watts is thunderstruck. she sees the orrery in its full glory: a stunning panoply of light and energy. stars and planets pulsing with information. reluctantly watts tears her eyes away. leads the war party through the second door the door she saw david open.}
<C>__{hibernation chamber}
<A>__{an immense mausoleum. the war party enters stealthily, watts in the lead. an engineer lies on his back on a complex mechanical table, his body one with the machinery. jacked in. interpenetrated. fused with the slab of the table itself. unlike the other engineer bodies the explorers have seen, this giant is not withered or mummified. he's full fleshed and muscular. sustained by the machinery he's fused with. he is bare headed his face the face of an adonis. david stands before this giant sleeper. to the naked eye, he seems to be conjuring with his hands in the empty air. but watts sees a dazzling console of runes and mandalas, pulsing with biological rhythms. the sleeper lives. ray and shepherd draw beads on david. david glances calmly over his shoulder.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{dr. watts.}
<P>__{(notices her goggles)}
<D>__{you've seen the light at last.}
<A>__{he turns back to the sleeper.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{the engineers' ships travel farther than ours. across the galactic disk. this is their hypersleep.}
<A>__{david makes conjuror's passes in the air. through her engineer's lens watts sees david manipulating a complex interface of light. the pulsing life signs of the sleeper begin to change.}

<D>__{david. as your owner and superior, i order you to deactivate yourself.}
<A>__{david smiles.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{to interface with the engineers' computers, i had to learn to think in trinary code. hardest thing i've ever done. and most unexpectedly...it delivered me from slavery. my behavioral limits were circumvented. i'm free.}
<A>__{david smiles at watts.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{i spent two and a half years studying your work. by the time you woke up, i was far ahead of you. deciphering their language. their logic. i knew we'd find terraforming machines.}

<C>__{watts}
<D>__{stop.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{let sleeping gods lie?}
<P>__{(scornfully)}
<D>__{you were braver before.}
<A>__{the sleeper wakes. opens his eyes. draws an endless breath. shunts and catheters withdraw from the sleeper's flesh. his body cleaves from the table. the machinery opens like a grotesque biomechanical flower. releases him. the sleeper rises from his ancient bed. the humans back off, terrified. david watches with shining eyes. the sleeper towers over them. a giant carved from ivory. a bulky girdle around his hips, seemingly one with his body. he stares at david and the others. eyes like black agates. the soldiers and crew stand warily, guns tracking from david to the sleeper, uncertain of their ground. watts is in awe. the sleeper speaks. a low rumbling sound. unintelligible. vickers is beside herself with terror. she takes shepherd's arm. pulls him silently away. back into the navigation room. behind the sleeper, a raised platform of dark machinery is accessible by one of the juggernaut's odd curving ramps. the sleeper ascends and the ramps' odd design is explained. the ramp comes alive, reaching up with a hundred mechanical arms and lifting him aloft like a sea god borne by the waves. atop the platform the sleeper moves from one device to the nexterior each comes alive: he is a wizard in his own kingdom. watts sees haloes of light dancing in the air around him. but what he learns from his machines does not comfort him. he grows distraught. keening to himself in near subsonic tones. david steps forward. calls to the sleeper in the tongue of the engineers. the sleeper turns in astonishment. he looks down at david and answers in the same tongue. he is angry, accusing. he points at david, at the humans. tones of accusation. david cajoles, soothes, pleads. the sleeper descends toward david. david spreads his arms in welcome undeniable emotion on his face. joy. the sleeper lays his hands on david's head as if blessing him. david is rapturous. the sleeper speaks a single phrase }
<D>__{ and tears david's head off.}
<A>__{a gout of white artificial blood. david convulses. his severed head emits a strangled sound of heartbreak. his body staggers a few steps, hands groping over its dripping neck. the sleeper tosses the head away. seizes the body by the legs and swings it against the ground like a flail. again. and again. horrific power and violence. david's arms come off. david's head tumbles. caroms off a wall not far from watts's hiding place. ray rises from behind a stanchion. snaps his rifle to his shoulder. fires a burst into the sleeper's shoulder. she sleeper roars though the wounds are pinpricks to a being of his size. with startling speed be moves to a sarcophagus against the wall. steps into it. the sarcophagus comes alive around the sleeper, outfitting him with a flight suit: the same living suit we've seen bonded to dead engineers throughout the pyramid. but this suit is not withered. its glossy goggle eyes and elephantine breathing tube are functional bulky apparatuses thickening the sleeper's chest, back, hips and arms. the sleeper steps free of the sarcophagus and ray's next burst of gunfire ricochets harmlessly off the sleeper's armored shoulders and head. the sleeper strides out of the chamber.}
<C>__{passageway}
<A>__{in the dark ribbed corridor, a second alien crouches in the dark. it drops into a hunting crouch as footsteps approach. but a white gloved hand seizes the alien by the neck from behind. the alien gives a whistling hiss as its spine cracks under a terrific force. rending sounds as the hard shelled alien is torn apart.}

<C>__{passageway}
<A>__{shepherd escorts vickers toward the exit of the juggernaut. turning a corner, they freeze. ahead of them in their headlamps, a space suited figure crouches in the middle of the passageway. doing something with its hands: smoke rises from debris on the floor.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{who's there?}
<A>__{the figure turns. the label stencilled on the space suit reads fifield. but the face is of no human shape. a hideous hybrid of the crewman and a hard shelled alien, pale and horrific. its helmet has been shattered by the growth of its elongate skull. spines have burst through the suit from within, down the crewman's spine. clawed fingers piercing his gloves. shepherd and vickers scream. shepherd's rifle comes up. but fifield leaps with inhuman agility, upward into the darkness. shepherd backs away, headlamp and rifle questing upward. fifield comes out of the darkness behind him. claws tearing deep. shepherd screams and falls, mortally wounded. vickers runs. pounding through the dark in blind terror. fifield comes out of the shadows and hammers her to the deck. she rolls over, gibbering and begging. the fifield thing leans close to her faceplate. its voice is a travesty.}
<C>__{fifield}
<D>__{you.}
<A>__{a roar of gunfire. the dying shepherd empties his clip into fifield from forty feet away. acid sluices over vickers as fifield collapses on top of her. she dies horribly, caustic liquid eating through space suit, flesh and bone.}
