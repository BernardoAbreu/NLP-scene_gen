<L>__{interior foyer.}
<A>__{the door flies open and he rushes in, breathless. david glances around the house to make sure that it is empty. he crosses into the living room.}
<L>__{interior living room.}
<A>__{david rushes to the tv and grabs the remote. he looks down at it, glances at the television, then bolts for the front door.}
<B>__{main street. day.}
<A>__{david moves quickly down main street looking for a place to stash the remote. he pauses in front of the pleasantville travel agency. it has posters in the window depicting various destinations in and around pleasantville (the place doesn't see much business). david bends down to stash the remote in a drain pipe near the entrance when he hears voices from up the street.}
<B>__{wider.}
<A>__{david turns to see a small crowd up near the end of main street. he sticks the remote in the drain pipe and rises to his feet as the voices get louder.}
<B>__{different angle.}
<A>__{the crowd is moving toward him. a woman walks in front of a group of young men who circle around her, taunting and harassing her. a moment later david can make out the face: betty clutches her handbag to her chest while the crowd circles her like a pack of dogs.}
<B>__{closer. betty.}
<A>__{the rosy hue of her face stands out in stark relief to the black and white faces around her. betty holds her head high with dignity (and fear) while the ugly epithets overlap one another "oooh let's see the rest of you ... let's see what's under that nice blue dress ... bet she's even pinker than her picture ..." one of the boys yanks at betty's skirt and she quickens her pace. just at that moment the boy is shoved to the ground ...}
<B>__{wider.}
<A>__{david shields his "mother" as he shoves one of the boys into the dirt. the kid gets up but david punches him hard in the side of the jaw and the rest of them just stare. (violence is as new as anything else and it seems to freeze the moment.) david steps in front of his "mother" with both fists clenched.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(as scared as she is)}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{he plants his back foot primed for action. the crowd of black and white thugs just stares at it.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{come on!}
<B>__{angle. crowd.}
<A>__{they look at him warily. the boy reaches up and feels the side of his mouth where a trickle of red blood is running down his chin. he looks at his finger in horror and starts backing away.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{get out of here!}
<A>__{they back away further and david takes a threatening step. the boys turn and run as he turns back to face his "mother." different angle. betty. (over david's shoulder) david moves up to her gently.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<A>__{she nods, still clutching her purse to her chest. david reaches out and touches her cheek when suddenly her eyes go wide.}
<C>__{david }
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{closer. still over david's shoulder. betty reaches into her purse and pulls out her compact. she opens it, and holds it up to david, showing him the reflected image of his own face. at last he has turned to color.}
<B>__{reverse angle. david.}
<A>__{he holds the mirror staring at his own reflection. the courage which transformed him only seems to grow. they look at each other, both in color now, when david puts a gentle arm around her shoulder.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{he begins to lead her up toward the corner.}
