<A>__{spock is seen in a medical office with pike, who lies in bed, recovering mccoy monitors him spock exits walks through the corridor sees a vulcan in silhouette, staring out at the academy. sarek. spock moves to him says quietly:}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{father...?}
<A>__{sarek turns but it isn't sarek. it's spock prime. who says:}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{i am not... our father.}
<A>__{an incredible beat, our two spocks in eye lock... both minds processing conversational possibilities at an incredible rate... surreal extensions of each other, separate but connected...}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{... fascinating.}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{there are so few vulcans left. we cannot afford to ignore each other.}
<A>__{young spock's eyes flicker in puzzlement...}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{then why did you send kirk aboard when you alone could've explained the truth?}
<C>__{spock prime}
<P>__{(beat, simply)}
<D>__{because you needed each other. opposing yet complimentary opposites. it was that balance between us i should say you and kirk that often made the impossible, possible.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{... it was a test?}
<C>__{spock prime}
<P>__{(no: his heart heavy)}
<D>__{i'm in no position to pass judgment... my actions have robbed you of much. i could not also deprive you the revelation of all you can accomplish together... of a friendship that will define you both in ways you cannot yet realize.}
<A>__{there is, to young spock's surprise, vulnerability in that.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{how did you persuade him to keep your secret?}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{i inferred universe ending paradoxes would ensue should he break his promise.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{you lied.}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{i implied.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{a gamble...}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{an act of faith. one i hope you'll repeat in the future.}
<A>__{young spock considers an enduring friendship between him and kirk... for the first time, understanding it. but }
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{the future's not what it used to be... in the face of extinction, it's only logical i resign my starfleet commission and help rebuild our race.}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{and yet, you are in a unique position... you can be in two places at once.}
<C>__{spock prime }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i urge you to remain in starfleet: i've already located a suitable planet on which to establish a vulcan colony, and assist in the foundation of a new science academy.}
<A>__{young spock takes that in, resolute...}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{my future cannot be determined by your past. we are one, but not the same.}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{then i ask that you do yourself a favor. put away logic. do what feels right. the world you've inherited lives in the shadow of incalculable devastation... but there's no reason you must face it alone.}
<A>__{spock prime moves to the door, stops. offers the vulcan salute:}
<C>__{spock prime }
<D>__{as my customary farewell would appear oddly self serving, i will simply say... good luck.}
<A>__{their eyes hold. spock turns, disappearing into the corridor. young spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a jumble of thoughts... and our music builds...}
