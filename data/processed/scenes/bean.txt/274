<A>__{the front of the car isn't what it was. there has been a big fire. it's out now three decanters lie empty. bean is not happy. finally, he decides to go for brute strength. he turns the car on again, puts it into reverse, and puts his foot down on the accelerator. we see the car from above. full throttle. totally still. totally still. and then whoooosh wham!!! it reverses at 100 mph straight backwards, smashing violently into and destroying the back of the car behind as it happens, bernie's car.}
