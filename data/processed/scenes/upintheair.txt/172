<D>__{oh no...}
<A>__{the gershwin theme song for the airline rains down from the overhead speakers. passengers clap. flight attendants gather at ryan's seat with big smiles and champagne. ryan doesn't even react. he's just stunned. the flight attendants separate just enough for a man in a bomber jacket to squeeze through. it's maynard finch, the chief pilot from the commercial.}
