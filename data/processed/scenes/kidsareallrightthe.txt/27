<L>__{exterior wysiwyg, parking lot day}
<A>__{the kids and paul exit the restaurant. paul walks to a classic bmw motorcycle. lasers tries to hide his awe.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{is that yours?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah. you like motorcycles?}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{yeah, but...our moms are kind of anti motorcycle.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{and by "kind of" he means they'd kill us if we ever rode one.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's too bad. they're fun.}
<A>__{time to say goodbye. again, no one knows the protocol here. after an awkward beat, paul holds out his arms for hugs.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{well it was great to meet you guys.}
<A>__{he and joni hug.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{i hope this was okay.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{yeah...totally...thank you.}
<A>__{now paul and laser share a somewhat awkward man hug.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{really nice to meet you, laser.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{joni gives a quick wave to paul. she turns to go and laser follows. paul watches them walk away. he looks stirred up by the meeting.}
