<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{harold. it's one in the morning. we're an hour from home. and who do we see, but your dream girl standing outside a theater playing your favorite movie. i mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic comedy, and i was your annoying gay friend, this would be the moment i'd tell you "this is a sign."}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{stop it.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{come on. just pretend you're a nerdy asian tom hanks and she's a hot latina meg ryan...with bigger tits. besides, you yourself said things are starting to go our way...}

<A>__{kumar tries kicking harold's hand off the gas. just then,}
<B>__{the car begins shaking intensely...}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{oh shit!}
<A>__{harold's infiniti has driven off the road and is speeding}
<B>__{down a dirt and rock covered hill.}
<A>__{kumar grabs control of the wheel and tries to steer the car safely. harold is bumping around on the way down the hill. finally, they reach the bottom of the hill, near a dirt road.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{you asshole! my car's probably all scratched up now!}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{don't blame me. you're the one who ran us off the road!}
