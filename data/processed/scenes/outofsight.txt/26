<L>__{exterior parking area same}
<A>__{as karen puts the shotgun on two more cons, both filthy dirty, standing by the hole they just crawled out of.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{get your hands in the air!}
<A>__{buddy watches the two cons, both latins, make up their minds, start edging away shit, they've come this far. they look out at the spotlight sweeping around in the dark, then look the other way, along the fence towards the main gate, to see armed hacks coming out on the run, and that decides it for the cons. they take off running... now buddy watches as karen puts her pump gun on them, but doesn't fire... the hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it, open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are cut down as they run. the hacks glance at karen, but don't bother with her, more interested in the hole the convicts had come out of. now they're standing by it peering in, edging closer with their weapons ready, then they all step back at once, bump into each other as... a head appears wearing a guard's baseball cap, the guy now saying something to the guards, his face smeared with muck, excited, pointing towards the orange grove. they run off, pausing briefly to kick the convicts they shot to see if they're alive, then keep going. the man in the hole, foley, climbs out. he takes his time, puts on a show, standing with his hands on his hips like an honest to god hack, that serious cap down on his eyes. buddy waves to foley to come on and karen turns and puts the shotgun on buddy. buddy raises the palm of his hand.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{it's okay, honey, we're good guys.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what're you doing here?}
<A>__{not so much asking, but putting it to him the way cops do when they're already pretty sure what you're doing. she glances around to include foley, now coming at her like some creature out of the swamp, giving buddy time to take her around the neck. she fights him, jabs him in the gut with the butt end of the shotgun before foley wrenches it from her grip. they drag her to the rear end of her car, the trunk lid still up, and crouch there as some hacks come running along the fence, past the dark gun tower and cross the road towards the orange grove. a moment later, they hear bursts of gunfire, then silence.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i bet that's all the hacks they send out. otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{why don't we talk about it later?}
<A>__{he turns to see foley and karen staring at each other in the headlights from buddy's car; karen not at all afraid.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{why you're just a girl. what do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.}
<A>__{foley keeps staring at her like he's giving the situation serious thought, but what he says is...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i bet i smell, don't i?}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{listen, you hop in the trunk and we'll get out of here.}
<A>__{karen looks at him, then gets up, climbs into the trunk. she's reaching around, trying to find her pistol, when... foley gives her a shove and gets in with her, wedging her against the wall of the trunk, pressing against her back like they're cuddled up in bed. he holds her to him, giving her no room to turn and stick the gun in his face. buddy reaches for the trunk lid and then everything goes...}
<B>__{black}
<A>__{total darkness, not a crack or a pinpoint of light showing. then we hear the engine come to life, the car moving along.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{you comfy?}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{if i could have a little more room.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{there isn't any. all this shit you got in here. what is all this stuff anyway? handcuffs, chains... what's this can?}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{for your breath. you could use it. squirt some in your mouth.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{you devil, it's mace, huh? what've you got here, a billy? use it on poor unfortunate offenders.}
<A>__{a beam of light appears as he finds a flashlight and turns it on. he plays the beam along karen's leg, calms down some as he looks at all of her now and finally says...}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{where's your gun, your pistol?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{in my bag, in the car.}
<A>__{they go over some bumps. we hear men's voices from somewhere far off, outside.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{you know you don't have a chance of making it. guards are out here already, they'll stop the car.}
<A>__{he runs his hand down her thigh, looking for her gun, but also, just, well, looking.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{they're off in the cane by now chasing cubans. i timed it to slip between the cracks, you might say.}
