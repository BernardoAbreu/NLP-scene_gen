<A>__{afternoon light, marcus sits on the floor by a room door, shotgun leaned on the wall at his side. he has the bible open in his lap, head bowed over it. closer his eyes are closed, he's asleep. the door opens behind him, star peers out and looks relieved to see marcus is still with them. as she takes a step toward him, he starts awake.}

<C>__{star}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{it's a flower. a rose.}
<C>__{star}
<P>__{(full of wonder)}
<D>__{so... all those numbers... you could call them and get, like, flowers, or someone to come over and fix stuff, or bring you food...}
<C>__{marcus}

<A>__{star's face lights up, she nods eagerly, sings along:}
<D>__{marcus & star "how i wonder what you are... up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky..."}
<A>__{star is dizzy with emotion, wipes an eye, turning away.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you ok?}
<C>__{star}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{somebody used to sing that to me.}
<A>__{marcus puts the phonebook aside, puts a hand on her arm; and she leans into him for a hug, tears forming in her eyes.}
<C>__{star }
<D>__{stay with us, marcus. please.}
<A>__{marcus looks down at her, affected.}
