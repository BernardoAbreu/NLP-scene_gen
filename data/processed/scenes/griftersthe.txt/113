<D>__{roy dillon, mr. kaggs.}
<C>__{kaggs}
<D>__{good! send him in.}
<A>__{with a now we're getting somewhere manner, kaggs turns back to the vdt, punches up a different set of data, sits looking at it in gloomy satisfaction. roy enters, and kaggs rises, extending his hand across the desk. they shake hands.}
<C>__{kaggs}
<D>__{good to have you back, roy. i was just looking at }
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{mr. kaggs, i'm sorry.}

<C>__{roy}
<D>__{oh, i'd like to stay on. just keep everything the way it was.}
<C>__{kaggs}
<D>__{that's what we'll do, then. but i tell you what, roy. before i hire anybody else, i will ask you one last time. fair enough?}
