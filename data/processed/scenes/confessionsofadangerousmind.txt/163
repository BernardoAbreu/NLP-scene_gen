<C>__{housekeeper }
<D>__{housekeeping, mr. barris.}
<A>__{barris looks around. the place is a disaster. food wrappers, crumpled papers, liquor bottles, strewn clothing, plastic army men set up for battle. he gets up, puts on a hotel bathrobe and his hat, grabs his gun, checks the peephole for a long moment, and answers the door. the housekeeper is plump and kind looking.}
