<A>__{the toilet is gross, tiled a queasy green, graffiti covered. our girl finishes peeing, gets up from the toilet, uses her foot to flush and her elbow to turn on the faucet. she washes her hands, holding them under the automatic dryer. broken. she wipes her hands dry on her jeans. is about to exit when she catches sight of her reflection in the dirty mirror. on impulse she takes out her glasses from her purse. slips them on. checks herself out in the mirror. cool? sexy? with her glasses on she notices something scratched into the dirty mirror.}

<A>__{where we see:}
<D>__{"j.c.r. 12 24 88 r.i.p."}
<A>__{she frowns, slips her glasses back in their case and moves to exit. but when she grips the doorknob she finds it locked. she frowns. rattles the doorknob a few times. a look of panic crosses her face, and she starts rattling the doorknob harder. did someone lock her in? suddenly the doorknob comes off in her hand. she pounds on the door with the heel of her palm, shouts:}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{hey. hey, i'm locked in here!}
<A>__{nothing. she turns, scanning the filthy bathroom, notices something.}
