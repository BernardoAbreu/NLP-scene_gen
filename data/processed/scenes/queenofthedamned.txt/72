<A>__{through the balcony we see the last warm colors of the sunset vanish into the blue of night. lestat awakens, his manacles removed. he stretches, shakes his head, as if clearing his head, but something causes him to stop... something has changed. marius's paints have gone. some of his paintings remain, but his easel and paint boxes are removed, leaving splattered outlines on the faded marble floor.}
