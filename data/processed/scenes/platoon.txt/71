<L>__{exterior village tunnel day}
<A>__{in another part of the village, barnes hovers over a hole leading into some kind of tunnel.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{get out of there you fuckheads move! move!}
<A>__{fires a warning shot. three villagers climbing out of the spider hole, arms raised, but not showing any emotion. barnes turning to his radioman hoyt and big harold accompanying.}

<P>__{(to harold)}
<D>__{put'em in the pig pen.}
<P>__{(to hoyt)}
<D>__{there's more down there. gimme your willy pete.}
<A>__{hoyt, with reluctance in his eyes, hands over a specially shaped grenade. barnes stands over the hole, the grenade in hand. the three villagers who just came out of the hole, yell from the distance, to others still in the tunnel, pleading with them to come out.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{fire in the hole!}
<A>__{barnes throws the phosphorus in. a muted explosion. then sizzling acidic fumes. frying sounds. a hideous scream from somewhere deep in the hole. hoyt, watching, is sickened. barnes businesslike. the villagers, in grief, howl and tear at their faces.}
<C>__{fu sheng}
<P>__{(hustling up to barnes)}
<D>__{sarge, we found some shit!}
