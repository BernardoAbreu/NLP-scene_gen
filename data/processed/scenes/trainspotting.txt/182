<A>__{an exceptional man is waiting. andreas leaves the room and closes the door. the man opens both and tastes the heroin. he produces a set of kitchen scales from his bag and weighs the two bags.}

<P>__{(v.o)}
<D>__{straight away he clocked us from what we were: small time wasters with an accidental big deal.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{so what do you want for it?}
<C>__{begbie}
<D>__{twenty thousand.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{but it's not worth more than fifteen.}
<C>__{begbie}
<D>__{ninteen.}
<A>__{the man shakes his head and lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{nineteen i can't offer you, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{renton}
<P>__{(v.o)}
<D>__{this was a real drag to him. he didn't need to negotiate. i mean, what the fuck were we going to do if he didn't buy it? sell it on the streets. fuck that.}
<A>__{the deal is done. the man hands over the money and waits as it is counted, then leaves with the drugs.}
<P>__{(v.o)}
<D>__{we settled on sixteen thousand pounds. he had a lot more in the suitcase, but it was better than nothing. and just for a moment it felt really great, like we were all in it together, like friends, like it meant something. a moment like that, it can touch you deep inside, but it doesn't last long, not like sixteen thousand pounds.}
