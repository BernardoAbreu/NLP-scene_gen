<A>__{salander's laptop is monitoring anita's computer, her hard line phone and cell. blomkvist emerges from the bathroom, rests a hand on salander's shoulder to peer over it at the screen: in one of the windows, cards are dealing themselves.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{she's playing solitaire?}
<P>__{(salander nods)}
<D>__{and she still hasn't called anyone.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{do we have her cell, too?}
<A>__{salander points to one of the windows on the screen. his hand comes off her shoulder.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i was so she'd lead us to her.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{put your hand back on my shoulder.}
<A>__{he does. they watch the solitaire game together ...}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{there's only one reason she wouldn't call harriet. she can't because harriet is indeed dead.}
