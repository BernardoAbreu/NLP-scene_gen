<L>__{interior boarding house hall night}
<A>__{carter opens the door. keith is outside. he's sweating. his tie is somewhere round the back of his neck and his suit is covered with dirt.}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{thorpey. they were waiting for us in the car park.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{four of them.}
<A>__{carter pulls keith inside and turns out the light. a ford zodiac comes along the road. it stops. four faces peer into the darkness where they're standing. nobody gets out. the back window winds down. thorpe's nervous voice floats out.}
<C>__{thorpe}
<D>__{jack?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{good evening.}
<C>__{thorpe}
<D>__{i'd like a word with you, jack.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{that's nice.}
<C>__{thorpe}
<D>__{confidential, like.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{you stay in the car. i will come and listen. (}
<P>__{(he leaves the}
<D>__{darkness and walks}
<P>__{to the car.)}
<D>__{what you want to tell me, thorpey?}
<A>__{thorpe holds out his hand.}
<C>__{thorpe}
<D>__{i've been asked to give you this.}
<A>__{he hands carter a railway ticket. carter smiles.}
<C>__{thorpe}
<D>__{train goes at four minutes past twelve. you've just got time.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{that's very kind of somebody. who do i have to thank? (pause) what happens if i miss the train?}
<C>__{thorpe}
<D>__{i've been asked to make sure you don't.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{oh, really. you're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, thorpey?}
<A>__{one of the men inside mutters.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{let's stop pissing about.}
<C>__{thorpe}
<D>__{are you coming, jack? it'd be best.}
<A>__{carter tears the ticket in half and drops it in the gutter.}
<C>__{thorpe}
<D>__{right lads.}
<A>__{the front passenger door starts to open. carter grabs it and pulls it wide open. with all his force, he slams it against the man as he gets out. the window shatters over his head. blood spurts everywhere. the driver panics. he accelerates away as the man in the back is getting out. his foot is trapped in a safety belt. he's upended and dragged along the tarmac, his head dangerously close to the back wheel. his yells make the driver brake. in the confusion thorpe escapes from the car and makes off. carter spots him and begins to run.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(roars)}
<D>__{thorpe!}
<A>__{thorpe turns into the main road. he makes for the dance hall and disappears inside. carter follows.}
