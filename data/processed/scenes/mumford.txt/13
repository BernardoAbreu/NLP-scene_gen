<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{later. the bar crowd has thinned. both mumford and skip have had a few. in fact, mumford is now carefully pouring them each another drink from a bottle of glensomething on the table.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you want me... to be... your friend.}
<A>__{skip beams. mumford leans forward in the same confidential way skip did before; he indicates that skip should lean in too. mumford is almost whispering }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{but that's not what's really going on...}
<P>__{(skip is excited)}
<D>__{...what's really going on is... you have some problems and you want some therapy, but you feel it could be very bad for panda modem stock if word got out that you were having head problems.}
<A>__{skip confirms that's it.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{can i ask you a personal question?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{of course! that's exactly what i want.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{have you thought about getting a wife?}
<A>__{skip makes a face and gesture to indicate a large "yes!", but also total frustration and failure.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{when panda started to happen, i was dating women from new york, san francisco, l.a. they came out of the woodwork. models, actresses, venture capitalists... these were not the kind of girls who were interested in me before i hit it... and you know what i discovered? i discovered these girls did not love me for myself. the majority of them didn't even like me. but a lot of them would've gladly become mrs. skipperton for a while. can you imagine that marrying someone just because they've got money?}
<A>__{mumford considers that.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i gotta pee.}
<P>__{(he gets up, a little wobbly)}
<D>__{can i ask you something? this town is called mumford... been that way since... 18... 18 0... 18 0...}
<P>__{(finally remembers)}
<D>__{...thirteen! right?}
<P>__{(mumford: if you say so)}
<D>__{now here's the question your name is mumford, too.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{is that the question?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{you moved here from back east and your name is the same as this town. is that right?}
<P>__{(mumford shrugs)}
<D>__{far out.}
<A>__{skip takes a few steps toward the men's room, then comes back and leans down toward mumford.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i hope you don't think i want you to do this for free. just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean i won't pay you like a doctor.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i have a lot of money. do you know how much money i've got?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{don't tell me, 'cause i'm not going to tell you what i've got.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i've got three big ones.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i'm impressed. i couldn't make three million dollars if i lived three lifetimes.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{no, no... i have three billion dollars.}
<A>__{skip stumbles off to take a leak. mumford takes a moment to digest that. it's difficult.}
