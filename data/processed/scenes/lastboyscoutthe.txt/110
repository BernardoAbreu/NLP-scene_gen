<L>__{interior yacht cabin}
<A>__{hallenbeck is opening a box of kitchen matches with his teeth. dozens of matches fall scattered on the carpet. he releases the box. bends. picks up a single match in his teeth. presses his face to the wall. gives his neck a wrench lights the match. he drops the match on top of the gas can. a whoosh of combustion. it bursts into flame. joe swivels around. balancing on his backside. thrusts his legs into the fire. strains. pulls. sweat runs in rivers. until the ropes binding his legs snap. he lurches to his feet, lets free. now there's only one problem: he's on fire. the legs of his pants are soaked with gas. flames race up his legs. he plunges headlong up the stairs.}
<B>__{on to deck}
<A>__{where he hurtles toward the rail, dives into the sea, swallowed by the waves. a crewman suddenly screams:}
<C>__{crewman}
<D>__{fire in the hole!}
<A>__{fire, indeed. it's a rapidly spreading blaze. the pursuit is momentarily forgotten as the crew races to put out the fire, and meanwhile:}
<B>__{hallenbeck}
<A>__{surfaces, gasping for air. trying to swim with his hands tied.}
<B>__{darian}
<A>__{spots him first. sees her father bobbing like a cork in the ocean, screams:}
<C>__{darian}
<D>__{daddy!!}
<A>__{jimmy whirls around, startled.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{shit. i don't believe it.}
<C>__{darian}
<D>__{do something! hurry!}
<A>__{jimmy spins the wheel. banks hard to port. brings the boat around in an arc. yells to darian:}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{keep the wheel like this! don't let it move!}
<A>__{she grabs the wheel. jimmy bends down. opens a compart ment. takes out the boat's anchor. metal hook, attached to seventy yards of chain. he hefts it like a grappling hook.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{third and long, baby, lets' go...}
<A>__{and, sure, his left arm isn't his good arm but, boy, does he heave that anchor. it soars through space, chain playing out behind it... hits water, thirty yards past hallenbeck who turns, sees the anchor skimming toward him over the waves.}
