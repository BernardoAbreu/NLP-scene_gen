<A>__{everyone present is motionless as rocky is in the bathroom. alone, rocky is on his knee praying. completing his silent prayer, he stands and looks at himself in the mirror. suddenly a wave of emotion sweeps over him as he thinks that in a few moments he will face the most overwhelming challenge of his life. out in the dressing room, the door opens and a guard leans in and nods that it is time. he leaves... rocky steps out.}
