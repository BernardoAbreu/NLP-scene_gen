<D>__{"hollis j. mulwray chief engineer"}
<A>__{he enters an outer office. the secretary looks surprised.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{mr. mulwray, please.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{he's not in, mr.?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{gittes.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{may i ask what this is regarding?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{it's personal. has he been out long?}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{since lunch.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{gee whiz.}
<P>__{(he glances at his watch)}
<D>__{and i'm late.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{he was expecting you?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{fifteen minutes ago. why don't i go in and wait?}
<A>__{without waiting for a response, he does. the secretary half rises in protest but gittes is through the inner door. mulwray's inner office the walls are covered with commendation, photos of mulwray at various construction sites, large maps of watershed areas and reservoirs in the city. on the desk is a framed, tinted photo of evelyn in riding clothes. gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he does. he begins to open and close the desk drawers after quickly examining the top. he tries one of the drawers and it doesn't open. he reopens the top drawer, and the bottom one opens. he looks in it, pulls out a checkbook. he opens it, riffles through the stubs like he was shuffling cards. drops it, finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and a menu from a water department lunch at the biltmore hotel in 1913. then, he flips through them, reads one notation in mulwray's neat hand:}
<D>__{"tues. night. oak pass res. 7 channels used."}
<A>__{gittes spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent pane. he quickly tosses item after item back, kneeing the drawer, nearly knocking a spare pair of mulwray's glasses off the desk top when he does. he catches them, puts them on the desk and is pacing the room as the door opens.}
<B>__{russ yelburton}
<A>__{enters the room. an anxious secretary is right behind him.}
<C>__{yelburton}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<P>__{(extending his hand)}
<D>__{russ yelburton, deputy chief in the department.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(equally pleasant)}
<D>__{j.j. gittes. and it's not a departmental matter.}
<C>__{yelburton}
<D>__{i wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?}
<A>__{this is more a request than an invitation. gittes nods, follows yelburton out, through the outer office to his offices down the hall.}
<C>__{yelburton}
<P>__{(continuing; as they're going)}
<D>__{you see, this whole business in the paper with mr. mulwray has us all on edge.}
