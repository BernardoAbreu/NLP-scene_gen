<L>__{interior overflow pit}
<A>__{a blinding shock of white lights flood the chamber; sentinels blink and fall instantly dead, filling the pit with their cold, metal carcasses.}
<L>__{interior hovercraft}
<A>__{in the still darkness, only the humans are alive.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{neo?}
<A>__{his eyes open. tears pour from her smiling eyes as he reaches up to touch her. and she kisses hin; it seems like it might last forever.}
<T>__{fade to black: fade in:}
<B>__{on computer screen}
<A>__{as in the opening. the cursor beating steadily, waiting. a phone begins to ring. it is answered and the screen fills instantly with the trace program. after a long beat, we recognize neo's voice.}
<C>__{neo }
<D>__{hi. it's me. i know you're out there. i know you're working as fast as you can to catch me.}
<A>__{we close in on the racing columns of numbers shimmering across the screen.}
<C>__{neo }
<D>__{i thought i should call and let you know how things stand.}
<A>__{we dive through the numbers, surging up through the darkness, sucked towards a tight constellation of stars.}
<C>__{neo }
<D>__{i know you're real proud of this world you've built, the way it works, all the nice little rules and such, but i've got some bad news.}
<A>__{we realize that the constellation is actually the holes in the mouthpiece of a phone. seen from inside.}
<C>__{neo }
<D>__{i've decided to make a few changes.}
<A>__{we shoot through the holes as neo hangs up the phone. he steps out of the phone booth and starts walking, wearing a long black coat and dark glasses. he passes a mother dragging her little boy, who cranes his neck as neo takes off, flying up into the air.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{mommy! mommy!}
<C>__{mommy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{that man! that man flies!}
<C>__{mommy}
<D>__{don't be silly, honey. men don't fly.}
<A>__{there is a rush of air as the boy stares up as neo shoots overhead. his coat billowing like a black leather cape as he soars up, up, and away.}
