<C>__{powell}
<D>__{they boys'll be glad. we got a pool going on you.}
<A>__{mcclane tries to wrap paper towels on the foot but his grimace shows that is still hurts like hell.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(through his teeth)}
<D>__{yeah? what's the odds?}
<C>__{powell}
<D>__{you don't want to know.}
<A>__{suddenly remembering an nypd course in first aid from ten years ago, mcclane removes the improvised bandage, check the cut more carefully.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(as he work)}
<D>__{put me down for twenty anyway...i'm good for it...so, what got you off the street, al? you liked lousy coffee, or what?}
<A>__{powell doesn't answer right away. at the same time, mcclane swallows, seeing a gleam inside his foot. he gingerly probes, and pulls out a shard of glass almost three inches long from its angled gash, his mouth twisted in a silent scream all the way.}
<C>__{powell's voice}
<D>__{i...realized i couldn't do what i had to anymore...at least not out there. i had an...accident.}
<A>__{mcclane throws the glass across the room, forehead bathed in sweat.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{they way you drive, i can see why.}
<C>__{powell}
<P>__{(beat, serious)}
<D>__{i...i shot a kid.}
<A>__{realizing what he's hearing for the first time, mcclane's face shifts to a new kind of pain.}
<C>__{powell}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{eleven years ago. oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, i had all the right excuses...but afterwards... i really couldn't draw my gun again.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{i...i'm sorry. i didn't mean to make a joke of it.}
<C>__{powell}
<P>__{(offhand)}
<D>__{hey, you couldn't know.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{i still feel like shit.}
<C>__{powell}
<D>__{then this won't matter.}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{lapd's not calling the shots anymore.}
<A>__{and as mcclane reacts we go to:}
