<L>__{exterior car}
<A>__{davidov's feet crunch in the dirt as he walks to the back and opens the trunk. he removes the briefcase. then the duffle bag. he looks down at the dead body, head slumped forward, as before...but something is different, the clothes not quite right and then: the dead body moves, the head turns, davidov gasps... it is james bond.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{problem, comrade?}
<A>__{davidov pulls his hand gun from inside his coat, but bond is quicker. with a silenced pistol he shoots davidov in the head. one little red hole forms in his forehead as his eyes go wide and he crumbles, dead. bond climbs out of the trunk. crouches to examine davidov.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{old habits die hard.}
<A>__{he straightens. picks up the briefcase. it is locked. he searches davidov and finds a set of keys in his pocket. he opens the lock. inside the briefcase: four stacks of money. documents headed with the official crest of miratom. a new security tag, it looks just like the dead guy's, but has davidov's name and picture...some hologrammed (blank) security tags and a polaroid type camera. he picks up a blank security tag and inserts it in the camera. points at himself, takes a shot. punches in 'davidov' on the keypad. out comes a brand new pass. bond goes to look in the dufflebag but... a plane is approaching...he looks up. his p.o.v. a russian military jet appears over the trees, flying low, its red landing lights blinking.}
