<A>__{once again, mickey is seen leaving the building, but this time he bounds down the steps, jumping for joy. he runs swirling down the street, clapping his hands, happy with relief. upbeat, uptempo jazz plays in the background. several cars pass as mickey joyfully runs. suddenly he stops, his hand to his mouth, reflecting.}

<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{well, i don't realize it now, i know it all the time, but, but i managed to stick it in the back of my mind...}

<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{...because it it's a very horrible thing to... think about!}
