<L>__{interior main floor corridor continuous action}
<A>__{arthur looks back into the hallway. there still stands cyrus's ghost. arthur slowly takes off his glasses. cyrus is still standing there.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you... son of a bitch...}
<A>__{cyrus realizes he's been made. arthur runs over and grabs his uncle, throwing him into the wall. arthur throws a punch, landing a hard right on cyrus.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{stop the machine!}
<A>__{arthur punches cyrus again. and again. cyrus stumbles backwards, regains himself, smiles, then goes after arthur.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{well, well... it's nice to see you have some of the family blood in you after all.}
<A>__{the two men go at it. arthur's fighting for his life. he's like a wild man, throwing everything he's got, hitting cyrus everywhere. in the face, the body...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you took away everything i loved, you monster. everything!}
<P>__{(with every blow)}
<D>__{now. i. want. it. back!}
<A>__{but arthur has never been a warrior. cyrus, spotting his opportunity, retaliates. cyrus connects with arthur in the face, knocking him down. then he kicks arthur in the gut a few times, making sure he stays down.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{how dare you stand in the way of history, arthur! you are nothing, you hear me. nothing! i dedicated my entire life to this. every goddamn day. when have you ever shown that kind of dedication? huh? to anything?!}
<A>__{he kicks arthur repeatedly, like a sick mind kicking a dog to death.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{you make me sick.}
<L>__{intercut clockworks room}
<A>__{maggie slowly comes to, awakened from the irritating noise of the chanting. the huge gear works before her are spinning madly now. she notices kalina's bloody, squashed remains in the glass beyond.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(reacting to kalina)}
<D>__{jesus...}
<P>__{(rubbing her head)}
<D>__{man, what is that noise?!}
<A>__{then she notices the reel to reel machine on the table. maggie reaches the machine and looks for an off switch. can't find one. the chanting sound is unbearable. she finally shoves the machine off the table, and it goes crashing to the floor.}
<L>__{interior great hall}
<A>__{arthur regains himself... when cyrus appears over him.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{the world hasn't time for small people, arthur. people like you, or dennis. or kalina. it needs those who are willing to do anything, without question, for what they believe in.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you sonofabitch!}
<A>__{arthur rises to attack, but cyrus stops him with a steel sword he pulls from his cane. he points the blade beneath arthur's chin. arthur's eyes dart around, searching for a last way out. cyrus spots arthur thinking...}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{i'm sorry, arthur. unlike jean, you haven't got a choice this time. now make the sacrifice. or your. children. will. die.}
<A>__{the chanting sound suddenly ends. silence. cyrus looks around in shock and confusion. as does arthur. that's when he sees bobby's scooter come rolling behind cyrus from the other side of the corridor. arthur quickly seizes the moment and kicks cyrus's legs, throwing him off balance and stumbling backward, right into the path of the scooter. like a banana peel, cyrus slips on it and lands on his ass. arthur scoops up the cane, as cyrus struggles to get back to his feet. when cyrus turns back around, arthur cracks him across the chest with the cane... sending cyrus sailing down the hall. he lands at the opening of the great hall, stunned by what just happened. he glances back at the scooter, then over to where it came. nothing. he slips on his glasses for a moment, and there standing casually in the corridor is the ghost of dennis rafkin.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{... never bet against human nature, arthur. you'll always lose. arthur smiles in thanks.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{cyrus}
<A>__{just as he comes to on the floor. he looks up and there's nothing there. arthur puts on his glasses and sees 12 very deadly ghosts standing around cyrus. the ghosts of the house reach down and grab cyrus }
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{get away!! no!!!!}
<A>__{arthur watches as the ghosts tear into cyrus. it's a feeding frenzy. the last one in to tear in is the breaker. cyrus suffers a horrible ending.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{let me go! noo!!!}
<L>__{interior great hall ghost pov}
<A>__{cyrus is borne into the hall on the shoulders of the ghosts he enslaved. from children's pov he's floating in, kicking and screaming all by himself.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{the children aren't sure what to think. they only know they too will join their uncle unless something happens. their father rushes to the door }
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(to his kids)}
<D>__{don't look...}
<A>__{ghosts' pov the ghosts lift cyrus above their heads, all bloody and broken bones, bleeding and mangled... and throw him into the spinning gears of the ocularis. blood and bones and flesh go flying. this, and the damage maggie has caused down in the basement causes the ocularis to go haywire.}
<L>__{interior clockwork room continuous action}
<A>__{maggie stands before the mad machine as it whirls out of control.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{oh, sweet lord. what did i do?}
<A>__{maggie backs toward the door. the clockworks are breaking apart all around her. she tries the handle. it's locked.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{mutherfucka...!}
<A>__{the clockworks begin flying apart. gears and bits of machinery start bursting through the glass walls of the clockworks room.}
<L>__{interior great hall continuous action}
<A>__{the great glass groans deeply as the torquing of the clockworks causes sheets of glass to fall from their frames. two more rings have flipped up, the blades getting closer to the center of the ocularis and the kids. glass begins to break up all around arthur. shards of glass rain down. he knows he hasn't much time. kathy holds bobby close, protecting him.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{daddy!!}
<A>__{arthur doesn't know what to do, but he does know that he can't leave them there the same way he did with jean.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{just hang on! i'm coming!}
<A>__{arthur backs up, and takes a running jump through the spinning blades, just barely landing on the center island of the ocularis, with kathy and bobby. he looks for a way off but between the glass and the blades he knows there's no way they're getting out of there. arthur holds them both tight, covering their eyes.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{don't move! keep your head down!}
<L>__{interior clockworks room basement}
<A>__{as maggie's eyes go wide.}
<L>__{interior basement glass corridors various angles same time}
<A>__{huge bits of the clockworks come flying out the walls of the clockworks room, shattering all the glass in the basement.}
<L>__{interior great hall}
<A>__{the house starts to blow apart. glass rains down. arthur holds his kids tight. the house is crumbling all around them. the only place that's safe is where the three of them are standing. the fury builds to a crescendo of destruction, and then finally collapses! followed by silence... dust and smoke everywhere, blurring our vision. as it begins to dissipate, three figures slowly come into frame. arthur, kathy and bobby are standing on the only remaining section of the house left... the center island of the ocularis. all around them lies what's left of the house. a veritable skeleton of steel. the three of them open their eyes to survey the destruction.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you guys okay?}
<A>__{bobby nods.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{how did you know we'd be safe here?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i didn't. i just wasn't about to leave you guys.}
<A>__{kathy pulls her father into a tight hug, she's teary eyed.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{i love you, dad.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i love you, too.}
<A>__{as they look up, they notice jean, standing on the outer ring, circling around them. she's back to looking like her old healthy self, and she's smiling at her family. as she passes around them again... she's gone. arthur pulls his kids close, and that's when they hear }
<C>__{maggie }
<D>__{that's it!}
<A>__{they all turn to see maggie crawling out of the basement stairwell. she's a mess, she turns to arthur and the kids }
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{i'm through with this nanny shit. this was not in the job description. i'm sorry, you guys, but i quit... i quit.}
<A>__{this puts a smile on arthur, kathy and bobby's faces, as we...}
<C>__{fade out.}
