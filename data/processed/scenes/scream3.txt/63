<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the newspaper clipping ecu it's flipped over by a pair of hands. scrawled on back is:"i killed her"}
<T>__{we are:}
<L>__{interior detective kincaid's office day}
<A>__{detective kincaid paces around his room. a battered and bruised dewey and gale sit beside his desk in police uniforms (since their old clothes has obviously been drenched).}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{whoever it is, now is taking credit for maureen prescott's murder.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{but we know who killed maureen prescott, billy loomis and stu macher. i mean, they even told sidney how they did it!}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{yeah, but, if i'm not mistaken, you said in your book that sidney got it wrong before. she accused cotton weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it! maybe there is a third killer. sidney might know something}
<A>__{kincaid's eyes appear as if questioning dewey.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i told you, i don't know where sidney is. and even if there was a third killer, sidney doesn't know about it.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{that is for me to decide. i need to talk to her mr. riley, she is a key element in this case. i have a press}
<A>__{conference}
<D>__{in an hour, and i need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{four? there are five.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{ben damon. christine perkins. sarah darling. tom prinze. that's four, last time i learned how to count.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{what about angelina tyler? she was there too.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{police are still searching through the debris. could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.}
<A>__{kincaid seems to be getting a morbid charge out of all of this. he smirks ever so nefariously at dewey.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{ok, look. we all know that this has something to do with 'stab 3'. what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about maureen prescott.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{actually, there was more this time. this time, we found a picture too. dewey gale}
<P>__{(together)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{kincaid holds up a second ziplocked evidence bag. within is a blurry 5x4 of maureen prescott exiting a motel room with cotton weary. kincaid turns it over. also, written on it's back is 'i killed her'}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, cotton weary, is out of the country on business. his alibi checks out. seems he's got a tv show in australia, 100% cotton. it's supposedly the biggest thing down under since yahoo serious, but that's besides the pointerior}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{what does this have to do with sid?}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{who knows more about maureen prescott than her own daughter?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{well sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to maureen.}
<C>__{detective wallace}
<P>__{(chiming in)}
<D>__{what's your problem? last night you were almost charcoal. you gonna help us or what?}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{do you wanna have this conversation with a polygraph?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{is that a threat, detective?}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{when it's a threat, you'll know it.}
<C>__{dewey}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{is that a threat?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later? the issue is maureen prescott!}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{wrong, this issue is sidney prescott! and either mr. riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her. so, where is she?}
