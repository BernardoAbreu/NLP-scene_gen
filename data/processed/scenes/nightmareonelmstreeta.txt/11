<T>__{fade to black:}
<L>__{exterior a valley street. night.}
<A>__{angle on a modest home; no car, just a couple of bikes in the drive. every light in the house and yard is turned on. we hear the rock group madness played at a 'no adults home' volume.}
<L>__{interior tina's living room. night.}
<A>__{on glen, dialing. nancy and tina are watching, giggling.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{i can't believe his mother let him come over here.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{right. well, she didn't, exactly...}
<A>__{glen shoves a cassette into tina's ghetto blaster.}
<C>__{glen}
<P>__{(to tina)}
<D>__{see, i got this cousin who lives near the airport, that it's okay for me to stay with, right? so i found this sound effects tape at licorice pizza, and...}
<A>__{the phone is answered. glen jerks the tone arm off the record with a scruupt!!}
<C>__{glen }
<D>__{hello, mom?}
<P>__{(pushes the 'play' button)}
<D>__{yeah, out here at barry's.}
<A>__{a jet plane begins to make itself heard on the tape. glen moves the machine closer to the phone. it's a big plane sounds like a 747 coming in for a landing.}
<C>__{glen }
<D>__{huh? yeah, noisy as usual. glad we don't live here huh? yeah, aunt eunice says hello.}
<A>__{the jet is screaming in now, full flaps and howling like a monstrous banshee. nancy and tina dissolve into muffled giggles.}
<C>__{glen }
<P>__{(shouting over the din)}
<D>__{right, right i will call you in the morning! right! huh? yeah, sure, i, huh?...}
<A>__{suddenly the tape goes silent. glen blanches. next moment another engine is heard, but this one is a ford lotus screaming by at 180 mph.}
<C>__{glen }
<P>__{(reacting to his mother's reaction)}
<D>__{uh... some kid's drag racing outside, i think...}
<A>__{the sound effect changes abruptly to a speeding sedan and the ages old screech of brakes, last second scream and horrible collision. nancy gamely tries to find the right button to turn it off, but misses. there's a loud screek of fast forward mayhem glen improvises desperately.}
<C>__{glen }
<D>__{listen, mom, i got to go i think there's been an accident out front i }
<A>__{nancy jumps back from the cassette player world war ii bursts out at top volume machine guns, hand grenades, diving bearcats and shouts of charging huns. glen makes a last ditch dive and flings the cassette out of the machine. blessed silence at last.}
<C>__{glen }
<D>__{right. i will call the police. no, just some neighbors having a fight, i guess. i'm fine, i'm fine! call you in the morning!}
<A>__{he hangs up and sags back.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{worked like a charm.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{tina shoves another cassette in, and michael jackson's 'thriller' blasts from the stereo. the kids relax, the camera glides past}
<B>__{them to the window.}
<A>__{the wind is moving the bare tree branch outside. camera pans back to the comfortably threadbare room, uneasy. we see nancy poking at a flame in the hearth as tina comes foreground to draw the drapes.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{nice to have a fire.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{really. turn 'er up a little.}
<A>__{nancy turns a nearby valve handle, and the gas fire climbs brightly over its artificial log. tina joins her, heartened.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{maybe we should call rod, have him come over too. he might get jealous.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{rod and i are done. he's too much of a maniac.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{he should join the marines, they could make something out of him. like a hand grenade.}
<A>__{tina laughs despite herself. nancy brightens.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{see? you've forgotten the bad dream. didn't i tell you?}
<A>__{tina shakes her head, wishing she had forgotten.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{all day long i been seeing that guy's weird face, and hearing those fingernails...}
<A>__{nancy looks up with a flinch.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{fingernails?}
<P>__{(blinks, laughing)}
<D>__{that's amazing, you saying that. it made me remember the dream i had last night.}
<A>__{tina looks up.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{what you dream?}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{i dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; i dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room i was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. sort of ...obscenely. then he walked out through the wall on the other side. like he'd just come to check me out...}
<A>__{the story has left the room deathly quiet. especially tina seems effected.}
<C>__{tina}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{so what about the fingernails?}
<A>__{nancy remembers, imitating the frightful coincidence.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{he scraped his fingernails along things actually, they were more like fingerknives or something, like he'd made them himself? anyway, they made this horrible nose }
<P>__{(imitates)}
<D>__{sssssccrrrtttt ....}
<A>__{tina pales.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{nancy. you dreamed about the same creep i did, nancy...}
<A>__{the girls stare at each other.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{that's impossible.}
<A>__{they look at him. he looks away, as if suddenly listening.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{there's somebody out there, isn't there...}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{i didn't hear anything...}
<A>__{then there's an unmistakeable sound. a distinct scraping against the house, just outside the window. something multiple, thin and sharp. something like metal fingernails. nancy's mouth opens a fraction of an inch.}
