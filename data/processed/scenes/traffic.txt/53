<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, jonas. i don't care if that is the price you have gotten in order countries.}
<A>__{helena watches her husband pace as he talks. he can't help it, but a portion of this call is theatrical, for an audience's benefit, which in this instance happens to be his wife. helena's expression of annoyance resets itself into love.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{this is america, a different country. i am carl, a different man. so you see, everything about our situation is different and i believe the pricing will be different, too.}
<P>__{(beat, listens)}

<A>__{carl clicks off the phone, turns to helena.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{every day with this guy is like starting all over again.}
<A>__{carl winds down and finally becomes present in the room with his wife. he looks at her. she looks back.}

<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i got that. how was your day?}
<A>__{she pushes the topiary away from her. suddenly, she seems tired. carl comes over and puts his hand on her pregnant belly.}

<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i keep feeling like i'm forgetting something.}
