<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{suzie is sitting in front of a table full of jars. each jar has a shoot and is half filled with water. gideon is on his knees trying to fix the hinge to a cabinet. sunny is sitting almost under him listening to him tell stories. sunny has a coffee can full of marbles.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{all of the preachers were down in the basement of the church confessing their sins to one another. they were way down in the basement 'cause they figured no one would hear them. one of the preachers said, it makes me feel too shame to tell how bad i have been. you know them young gals that sit up in the first row. i can look at them and forget my texterior i'm just lost when it comes to women, even them middle age sisters. then another preacher said, i don't think i can tell you what my sin is 'cause it's bad. another preacher said, brother, we all amongst friends. tell us what's troubling your soul. clear your conscience.}
<A>__{gideon takes a sip of water.}
<C>__{gideon }
<D>__{so the preacher said, we all got a bond 'cause we confessed to one another. so let me tell you, my sin is corn liquor. i just acts a fool behind that spirit water. i loves it more than preaching. now ain't that a sin, lord. so all the preachers went on confessing, each one worst than the last. finally they came to the last preacher who had been very quiet and listening to every word that fell. one of the preachers said to him, it's your turn. confessing will lift you burden, brother. bare us your soul. we did. the last preacher said, no, my sin is the worst among all of you. one of the preachers said, ah go on man and stop all this suspense. so the last preacher said, like i told you my sin is the lowest.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{my sin is gossiping and i can't wait to get out and tell what i heard.}
<A>__{sunny does not get the humor of the story. he is more interested in picking up his marbles that gideon's foot kicked over.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{you oughtn't tell him stories like that.}
<C>__{sunny}
<D>__{tell me another story.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{i will you a story about the terrapin and the rabbit. no, you tell me a story. come on.}
<C>__{sunny}
<D>__{once upon a time, my mommy and daddy lived in this big house that i bought for them. i got them this big car.}
<A>__{a strong wind causes the broom handle to knock against the china teapot, knocking it to the floor. suzie stops sunny from trying to help pick up the pieces.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{you stay back. you might cut your fingers.}
<A>__{suzie looks down sadly at her broken tea pot.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{i looked everywhere for my toby.}
