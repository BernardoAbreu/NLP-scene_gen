<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{eli walks on. slow and steady. his gaze, as ever, fixed firmly on the horizon. takes a swig from his canteen. suddenly, he stops and stands stock still in the center of the road. impossible to know what he's thinking. he stands there for a long time.}
<L>__{exterior wasteland gas station day}
<A>__{solara comes upon an abandoned chevron station. she doesn't remember passing this. looks back up and down the road.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{where the hell am i?}
<A>__{there's a rusted car parked at one of the pumps. like every other car we've seen, stripped of its tires and engine. she walks around to the driver's side. a petrified female body lies on the ground, half in, half out of the car. solara claps her hand to her mouth and recoils, horrified. in the dead woman's hand is a dusty bottle of mineral water. solara hesitates. not wanting to get closer. but so thirsty. she braces herself, grimacing, and tries to take the bottle, but the dead woman's hand is closed tight around it. she pulls harder and wrenches it free. in the process she falls on her butt and flips the corpse over onto its back. in the other woman's arm, she has a skeletal baby cradled to her bosom. it seems to be staring right at solara. solara screams and frantically shuffles backward away from it. gets to her feet and runs across the forecourt. she stops by the station shop and rests against the wall, hyperventilating, heart pounding. trying to get it together. she inspects the water in the bottle. it looks clean. unscrews the cap with shaking hands and takes a sip. she spits it back out, coughing. it's rank. undrinkable.}
