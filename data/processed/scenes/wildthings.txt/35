<L>__{interior guest house day}
<A>__{pan to reveal room the gun case, the animal trophies, the photos one of a stately old gentleman in an elaborate wicker chair, a cane at his side, a bowler on his knee. others of kelly and a handsome middle aged man in safari gear, posing with their rifles above slain wildebeests and bison. sandra and kelly enter. kelly puts down the shotgun, turns, tears in her eyes.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{okay, what's the matter?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you notice my new jumper?}
<A>__{kelly does a three sixty, like a model on a runway.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{my friends buy me clothes, so i don't look like trash.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{i would hardly say you look like trash.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{no thanks to you.}
<A>__{she sits on the bed. sandra moves to stand over her, angry now.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{come off of it.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you run with all these little trust fund brats... they think money grows on trees. it doesn't. believe me. and a lot of your little friends are gonna learn that one the hard way.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm trying to spare you that.}
<A>__{kelly goes to one shoulder on the bed, sobbing now. her mother continues to stand over her, suddenly more perplexed than angry.}
<C>__{sandra }
<D>__{kelly. what is it?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i miss dad.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{jesus.}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{well, i do too, sometimes...}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{no you don't.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{he didn't have to kill himself, kelly. he could have gone out and gotten a job. christ, he could've found another rich woman... he never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.}
<A>__{she pauses as kelly cries all the harder.}
<C>__{sandra }
<D>__{i don't know why he did it. i really don't...}
<A>__{her voice trails away, as meanwhile kelly has drawn herself up into a fetal position on the bed. the sobbing has stopped but her shoulders continue to shake. sandra sits on the edge of the bed, reaches over to rub kelly's back.}
<C>__{sandra }
<D>__{can i get you anything?}
<A>__{kelly shakes her head, no. her mother looks at her, clearly at a loss. at last she stands. she is headed out of the room when kelly says something, but the words are indistinct, as her fists are pressed against her mouth.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{what, honey? i can't hear you.}
<A>__{there is a long beat as kelly collects herself. she stares at the wall, her eyes filled with tears, but when she speaks she enunciates each word.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i said. i was raped.}
<A>__{sandra looks as if she has been struck.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i was raped.}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{by sam lombardo.}
<A>__{sandra moves over to the bed, sits once more.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{he... sam lombardo?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yes. god, mom...}
<A>__{kelly begins to cry. sandra pulls her upright, cradling her in her arms, eyes on fire.}
