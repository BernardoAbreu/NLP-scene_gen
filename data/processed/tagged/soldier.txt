<L>__{interior hospital nursery night}
<A>__{babies in bassinets, isolettes, incubators. babies sleeping, babies blinking, babies cooing, babies chirping, babies squalling. it's the squalling babies, the ones with pinched faces and tiny bunched fists, that seem to interest the two anonymous men in military uniforms. (their anonymity is assured by the angles from which they are seen; they are hands, they are feet, they are the backs of heads.) a lone nurse watches them grimly as they make their "selections," marking the cribs of the most active, noisy babies with x's.}

<L>__{interior cage basement room day or night}
<A>__{vicious teeth, savage snarls, tearing flesh as three fierce fighting dogs battle a single wolverine in large steel cage. the cage is in the middle of a gloomy windowless room surrounded by twenty two year olds seated on folding chairs and dressed in identical gray overalls. as the two year olds watch the battle, amazement on their innocent faces, a date appears supered over the scene... we discover in the shadows more anonymous men (and women), some of them in military uniforms, observing the children.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior a windowless cement room day or night}
<A>__{it's creepy: the same children two years older, milling about a bare cement room, apparently unsupervised. they ought to look cute, but somehow these joyless four year olds look slightly sinister, all of them wearing drab uniforms and military burr cut hair. again a date is supered over the scene just as an aggressive four year old approaches a passive four year old seated on the floor and kicks him. it's a harmless child's kick. but then, as the date disappears, he kicks the passive four year old again. and again. the servo motor in a remote video camera mounted high on the wall whines slightly as the camera pans to the record the action.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior windowless "classroom" day or night}
<A>__{puzzles. fingers fit shapes into holes. the puzzles aren't fun puzzles; they're obviously tests of intelligence or dexterity or both. six year olds now, the boys perform in a grim room under fluorescent lights as more anonymous men and women in polished shoes and sharply creased military slacks cruise the aisles, observing. as a date appears supered over this scene... we notice one of the six year olds is becoming familiar to us. todd. we notice his intense eyes as he dexterously manipulates a puzzle.}

<L>__{interior gymnasium day}
<A>__{fourteen year old todd is doing bench presses in shorts while all around him his fourteen year old comrades work out with weights in a very grim and spartan gym that resembles a sinister concentration camp more than the yuppie spas of the 20th century. the date appears supered over the scene...}

<L>__{exterior obstacle course montage day}
<A>__{the fourteen year olds, todd among them, jump, roll, dive, crawl, swim, and rappel through a brutal course featuring: vertical wooden walls, fast moving rapids, tangles of barbed wire, steep rock faces, and finally a jungle of dangling chains with tiny circular "platforms" about eight inches in diameter every ten feet. fourteen year olds bloody each other with pugil sticks and padded cudgels while they swing twenty feet above the ground. one of them is knocked off, plummets downward. crunch!}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior snow covered landscape day}
<A>__{long even strides, two inches of snow. breathing hard, the sixteen year olds now lope through hills and woods in shorts and t shirts, their breath coming in steamy blasts as the date is supered over the scene... this a brutal cross country run under a grim sky in bitter cold weather, but the sixteen year olds are super fit, their faces hard and without expression, their eyes as cold as snake eyes. except for the straggler, a lone boy who's bringing up the rear, obviously in trouble, gasping for air, struggling, struggling, struggling to keep his feet... angle on a hill where anonymous observers, all in military dress, watch. angle on the straggler, unable to keep his feet, going down, gasping. with fearful eyes, he looks toward the hill where he knows the observers are. angle on the pack, sixteen sixteen year olds not looking back, even as a single shot rings out. todd doesn't even blink, just keeps running.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior shooting range day}
<A>__{suddenly, out of nowhere, a scary mechanized pop up target, a military figure, erupts from the long grass, weapon pointing. before the weapon can flash a laser bean, automatic fire ravages the target and it disappears back into the grass. the boys, eighteen year olds now, are wearing combat gear and carrying automatic weapons as they advance through a sloping field of tall grass. different sophisticated targets pop up urgently, sometimes close, sometimes far, some moving rapidly on tracks. the eighteen year olds expertly mow down menacing military figures while holding their fire when animal targets or unarmed civilians and children appear. the eighteen year old on point is riley, a muscular redhead. todd is right behind him as a date is supered over the scene... suddenly multiple targets appear, charging. budda budda budda! first target down! riley, panning for the next target, holds fire, passes over two mothers holding children, pans for a nearby soldier target. but the soldier target zips behind the mothers holding children, taking cover, weapon pointed at riley. for half a second riley hesitates! budda budda budda! todd blazes away, mercilessly blowing away the mothers holding children target and the soldier target.}

<L>__{exterior extraterrestrial city day}
<A>__{bombed out! buildings turned to rubble, smoking ruins, rain. an extra terrestrial city ravaged by war to such a degree that it bears an uncanny resemblance to dresden earth in 1945 after the fire bombing! the architecture, even in ruins, recalls old europe, and the streets are narrow, as in before (or after) automobiles. bursts of automatic fire, occasional mortar blasts. a spooky battle between unseen soldiers is taking place in seemingly deserted streets and alleyways. and supered over the gloomy scene...}

<A>__{a spartan room, bare bunk beds. rain pounds on a window that looks out into a stormy sky over the godforsaken ruins of the third dresden moon. todd is sitting on a bunk, shirtless. his new rank has been tattooed on his right cheek; there's a scar under one eye and another scar that distorts his lip slightly. the names of various battles have been neatly stenciled down his left arm, an official record, not a decoration. todd is silent, staring into space. the room is full of soldiers in t shirts, fatigues, sleepwear. words appear supered over the scene... the words fade away: , the silence continues, the rain beats on the barracks, no one says a word, they just stare into space or watch the rain beat on the windowpane. they look like robots...used robots, made individual only by their different scars.}

(the veterans, in spite of their impassive expressions, look very human compared to the new soldiers. their battle scars mark them as individuals in sharp contrast to the perfectly muscled young giants across from them.) the firing stops, and riley, his weapon empty, leaps to his feet and salutes rubrick, who's been watching the demonstration with the rest of the officers.}
