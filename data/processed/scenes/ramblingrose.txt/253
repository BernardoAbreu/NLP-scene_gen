<L>__{interior dentist's waiting room day}
<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{a shot of mother and buddy in the waiting room. enter dr. winton with a little frown.}
<C>__{dr. winton}
<D>__{well, she finally let me look in her mouth. is it true she's never been to a dentist?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{she was raised on a poor dirt farm. i'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.}
<C>__{dr. winton}
<D>__{well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, i don't see teeth like that once in ten years. her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. she has perfect teeth.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{but the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?}
<C>__{dr. winton}
<D>__{yes, and it's very bad. it probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{that would scare her to death. she's terrified of hospitals. to her, a hospital is where you go to die.}
<C>__{dr. winton}
<D>__{i think you're right, it would be harder on her. but you'd better call mr. hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.}
