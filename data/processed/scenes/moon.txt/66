<D>__{8:19 pacific time. lunar day 2. readouts are as follows: matthew, 9.8 miles...}
<A>__{suddenly the monitor blips a blast of static and sam sees himself talking on the monitor. it appears to be a previous log entry.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{luke...7.3 miles...wow, better look into luke...}
<A>__{but bizarrely, the sam talking on the monitor has long hair pulled back into a ponytail and no beard and then another blip another blast of static and the screen turns completely black. a single word begins to flash in the center of the screen: "error." the word flashes three times before the screen returns to normal, the clock running again. it all happened so quickly sam wonders if he didn't just imagine it. after an awkward pause he simply continues the original log entry.}
