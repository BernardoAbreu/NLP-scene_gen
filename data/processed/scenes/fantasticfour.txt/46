<L>__{interior von doom compound dining hall evening}
<A>__{the sun is long gone, and so are most of the diners. the room is darker, more romantic. ben finishes the last shrimp on his plate, pushes it away, belches prodigiously.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{pardon me...}
<A>__{sue and reed stare at him. ben's stomach growls again.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i think i need to lie down. bad shrimp.}
<A>__{this was ben's plan, but he really isn't feeling well, unsteady when he walks away. he looks down at his stomach.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{really bad shrimp.}
<A>__{angle: fireplace. sue looks gorgeous in the light. a beat. a long beat. reed doesn't know where to start with this woman.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{feeling better?}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{yes, thanks.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{that's good. that's uh...good.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{you always had a way with words.}
<P>__{(an awkward beat)}
<D>__{i should be getting back.}
<A>__{sue gets up to leave. exasperated, reed tries to think of something, anything, to say.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{i'm really happy for you and victor.}
<A>__{she slows down, looking at him. she was hoping for more.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{you're happy for me and victor.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship }
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{which was?}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{passion.}
<A>__{we see surprise on sue's face, and...}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{for science.}
<C>__{sue}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{you are such a dork, reed... you never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.}
<A>__{as if triggered by her emotion, the fireplace light around her bends. the flames flicker in a ghostly breeze.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{what? what did i say?}
<A>__{she looks more disappointed than angry.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{it's never what you say. it's what you don't say. what you don't do...}
<A>__{she lets that hang. a lot of history here. quiet, hurt she wants reed to fight for her, to show some emotion.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{i...i...i just wanted to }
<A>__{as sue's emotions swirl, she slowly...disappears.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{it's been two years, and all you can say is you're happy for me and some other guy...}
<P>__{(standing up, hurt)}
<D>__{you know, victor may be a lot of things, but at least he's not afraid to fight for what he wants...}
<P>__{(reed looks down)}
<D>__{and it's nice to be wanted sometimes. to be heard...seen... reed, look at me.}
<A>__{he looks up...but all that's left of her is the blush on her cheek and her bewitching eyes. he drops his fork, shocked.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{uh, sue...? i can't.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{what? what do you mean you }
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{sue...look at your hands.}
<A>__{she raises her hands, but we don't see them. we only see a medical waistband...floating. her watch...floating. her clothes appear to be suspended in mid air. sue is invisible. she shrieks and gets up knocking a glass off the table... slow motion: the glass flies off the table, tumbling... reed instinctively reaches for the bottle: his arm stretches two feet out of his sleeve grabs it just before it hits then snaps back into place. reed stares at his arm in disbelief. sue's eyes widen as well. the rest of sue reappears. they look at each other: mutual alarm.}
<C>__{johnny }
<D>__{you guys will not believe what just happened!}
<A>__{they look up to see johnny in the doorway, naked except for the nurse's pink parka wrapped around his midsection.}
