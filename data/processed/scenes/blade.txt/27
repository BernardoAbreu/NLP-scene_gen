<L>__{interior whistler's workshop day}
<A>__{we hear voices now, coming from beyond a series of black out curtains. karen pushes one aside and sees }
<B>__{blade}
<A>__{strapped into some kind of inquisition esque restraint chair. his shirt is off, his body slick with sweat. whistler finishes strapping blade in, then stands back, holding up a gas powered pistol injector, hesitant }
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{i had to increase the dose. you're building up a resistance to the serum }
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{just do it, old man.}
<A>__{whistler nods, fitting blade with a bite guard. then he presses the pistol injector against blade's carotid artery. blade shakes violently, grinding his teeth through the bite guard, veins cording in his neck. he clutches whistler's hand, holding it tightly as he fights his way through the hellish seizure. to his credit, whistler never lets go. mentor and student stare at one another as the mysterious serum runs its violent course. we understand that these shared moments, oddly private in their horror, are the glue which binds the two vampire hunters together. finally, blade slumps forward in his restraints, exhausted.}
<B>__{karen}
<A>__{she draws back, instinctively knowing that she's just witnessed something she shouldn't have. she looks for an exit, sees another doorway. she makes for it }
