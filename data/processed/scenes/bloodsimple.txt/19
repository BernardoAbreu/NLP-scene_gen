<L>__{exterior back of the bar parking lot}
<A>__{ray appears in the doorway. the music from the bar, though fainter, can still be heard. there are three or four wooden steps going down from the back door to the small gravel parking lot in back. ray backs down the stairs; marty's feet thump thump thump down the stairs after him. the rear door of ray's car is open. ray heaves in marty's torso. marty's legs rest on the ground outside the car. ray takes an ankle in each hand and pushes.}
<B>__{close shot ray}
<A>__{as he shuts the door. he looks up across the parking lot. ray's pov the incinerator belching fire and smoke. we hear its distant roar over the bar song. we hear the car door slam. high angle tracking shot toward incinerator we are looking down on ray's car as the camera tracks behind it towards the incinerator. at the cut the roar of the incinerator is suddenly louder. it grows louder still as we approach it. ray's car draws even with the incinerator without slowing or stopping. the wadded up towel is chucked out of his window into the fire. we hold on the fire as ray's car rolls on out of frame.}
