<D>__{suddenly he was dead. just like that! and my life changed forever. my mother said, go. study music if you really want to. off with you! and off i went as quick as i could and never saw italy again. of course, i knew god had arranged it all; that was obvious. one moment i was a frustrated boy in an obscure little town. the next i was here, in vienna, city of musicians, sixteen years old and studying under gluck! gluck, father. do you know who he was? the greatest composer of his time. and he loved me! that was the wonder. he taught me everything he knew. and when i was ready, introduced me personally to the emperor! emperor joseph the musical king! within a few years i was his court composer. wasn't that incredible? imperial composer to his majesty! actually the man had no ear at all, but what did it matter? he adored my music, that was enough. night after night i sat right next to the emperor of austria, playing duets with him, correcting the royal sight reading. tell me, if you had been me, wouldn't you have thought god had accepted your vow? and believe me, i honoured it. i was a model of virtue. i kept my hands off women, worked hours every day teaching students, many of them for free, sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians work and work and work, that was all my life. and it was wonderful! everybody liked me. i liked myself. i was the most successful musician in vienna. and the happiest. till he came. mozart.}
