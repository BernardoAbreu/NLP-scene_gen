<D>__{edmunds, bring up the robot's camera feed.}
<A>__{jane edmunds, 32, the unit archivist, works the control panel. another monitor clicks on showing the robot's pov of the door.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{captain, you know, i really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{nobody goes inside, until we know hat's nside.}
<A>__{on the monitor the robot camera scans the spacecraft hull, stops on a rectangular panel mounted to the left of the door.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{can you open that panel?}
<C>__{edmunds}
<D>__{working on it now, sir.}
<A>__{on the monitor a robotic claw extends out to the panel. trying to pry the panel open.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'd like it noted in the report that i think we should be doing this ourselves. making a manned entry...}
<A>__{the claw is clumsy, and keeps banging into the metal.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'd also like it noted }
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{duly noted, ted. edmunds, try using suction.}
<A>__{on the monitor another robotic arm extends out, with a rubber sucker. it pushes against the panel, but doesn't suck.}
<C>__{edmunds}
<D>__{it's not sucking, sir.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{thank you, i can see that. try something else.}
<C>__{edmunds}
<D>__{we don't have anything else to try, sir.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{well, shit find something, do something... make something up }
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what about a crowbar?}
<A>__{barnes straightens up, looks at ted...}
<C>__{barnes}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{for who? the fish?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{for whoever's in that thing.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{or whatever's in that thing.}

<A>__{norman, quiet in the corner, perks up...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{me? well i don't really... i mean, you could... you know, you could make a real solid case... a crowbar?}
<A>__{all eyes on norman.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i don't know.}
