<L>__{interior scimitar shuttlebay following}
<A>__{when the door closes behind them, picard turns and fires a disruptor blast sealing the door mechanism. they turn to face... a fleet of very small shuttles. they are uniquely designed. extremely compact and stream lined. a disruptor turret on each. they move toward one as:}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{according to the ship's manifest they are scorpion class attack fliers.}
<A>__{they quickly climb a scorpion.}
<L>__{interior scorpion cockpit shuttlebay following}
<A>__{the cockpit of the scorpion is cramped. picard climbs into the pilot's position. data assumes the gunner's position. they see disruptor fire trying to burn through the door to the shuttlebay picard powers up the scorpion as:}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(trying to figure out the controls)}
<D>__{what do you imagine this is?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{port thrusters, sir. would you like me to drive?}
<A>__{picard shoots him a look and presses some controls. the scorpion lifts off. hovers a few feet over the deck. picard elegantly swings it around toward the large shuttlebay external doors as:}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{can you open the shuttlebay doors?}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(working controls)}
<D>__{affirmative, sir. negative, sir. they have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{well then... only one way to go.}
<A>__{he swings the scorpion around again so it is facing the doors they came through, the doors back into the ship. data is dubious.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{do you think this is a wise course of action?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{we're about to find out... power up disruptors and fire on my mark.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{ready, captain.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{fire!}
<A>__{and the scorpion's forward disruptors fire! the doors into the ship explode! picard powers forward!}
