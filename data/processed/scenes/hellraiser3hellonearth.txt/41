<L>__{interior main room, joey's apt. night}
<A>__{the room is dimly lit.}
<B>__{angle on floor by tv set}
<A>__{the floor is littered with video boxes and tapes. other tapes are piled on top of the vcr. it's like somebody has been viewing constantly for a week and hasn't put anything away.}
<B>__{angle on sofa and coffee table}
<A>__{many books are lying on the sofa, the table, and the floor. some are lying open, most are closed. also on the coffee table are three different soft drink cans, a half empty cup of coffee, and a very full ash tray.}
<B>__{angle on bookshelfs}
<A>__{terri is standing by the bookshelfs, running her eyes and her finger along some titles. now we understand the chaos in the room. terri's home alone. she's bored and trying to find something to hold her interest. she looks away from the shelves and walks idly over to the tv. the box is back on top of the tv. terri's hand hovers near the on off switch of the tv. then it hesitates and picks up the box instead. terri holds the box and looks at it. her face becomes puzzled and she crosses the room to flick on a light. she wanders back to the tv looking at the box. it looks different. its edges are more sharply defined. the shard where it was broken from the pillar is smaller, smoother. the detailed metal work has some color back and is shining.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{jeez, joey musta polished you up some. sometimes i think she's wierder than me.}
<A>__{terri's voice trails off as she continues to look at the box. she turns it in her hands, running her fingers over its filigree surfaces. track in slowly as she cups it in both hands, her eyes moving from puzzlement to fascination and concentration. she rubs her thumbs over the designs. tracking in continues. it's tense. is she going to try and work the puzzle? suddenly .... brrrrrrrrr ... the phone rings. terri jumps in shock, nearly dropping the box. she puts the box back on top of the tv and crosses to the phone. she picks it up.}
