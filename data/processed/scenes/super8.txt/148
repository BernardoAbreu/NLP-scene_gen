<L>__{exterior road night}
<A>__{the bus is pushed twenty feet from something on the other side then it tips over and crashes to the ground:}
<L>__{interior transport bus night}
<A>__{windows shatter charles and cary seatbelts removed land on joe and martin! the three soldiers hit the window floor painfully hernandez so hard he's instantly unconscious! the bus is now motionless on its side, open door up. nelec rises. scared, but pissed. the rear wheels of the bus scream in rotation we countermove with the creature as it comes around the other side, climbs onto the exposed side metal and window}
<D>__{crunches }
<A>__{the boys gather their wits lights flashing hauntingly }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ you guys okay?!}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{ i wanna go home so bad }
<A>__{joe moves to the locked bulletproof glass door tries the handle but it's never gonna open. on the other side of the glass, nelec rights himself, momentarily disoriented breathing heavily, he moves away from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from the kids; he tries the handle, but it won't open for him either. and there is joe and nelec, face to face joe seeing the fear in nelec's eyes his understanding that this is his fate. somehow nelec takes this moment to look into joe's face to silently in a look repent. instantly, joe knows he's about to watch this man's life end. smash! nelec turns the creature is busting the bus door smashing at it to make it bigger. so it can get inside. the driver's leg is caught he's trying to get out, but cannot is panicking as sssstab!!! the creature kills him instantly and smash as again it tries to widen the door. nelec winces the only conscious man on this side of the glass; the boys cower on their side, with each monstrous hit, all their eyes on nelec except joe, who only wants to get to alice. he sees the shattered bulletproof window above them, on what has become the "roof" of the bus.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{up there, there's broken glass }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{ here, use me, i'm strong!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{lemme get on your shoulders!}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i'm strong!}
<A>__{the boys struggle to get joe onto martin's shoulders as, on the other side of the glass, nelec scrambles for hernandez's fallen semi auto rifle. he grabs it and scampers back to the glass as smash!!! pieces of metal and glass burst like ice chips as the creature violently widens the bus door opening on charles' shoulders, joe can reach the shattered but thick window which he must hit break open to get out essentially exactly what the creature is doing, in reverse. using both fists, joe pounds the window. no give.}
<C>__{martin cary}
<A>__{harder! come on, you pussy!!! with all his might, joe hits the window again the slightest sound of glass adjusting meanwhile, slam!!! the creature busting the bus door prying it wider like a sardine can nelec sits against the glass and opens fire, futilely, on the creature. he makes a call on his walkie:}
<C>__{nelec}
<D>__{this is nelec use the big guns. whatever happens to me, you take it down, you kill him }
<A>__{ and he drops the walkie and fires again the loud gunfire barely audible behind the glass with the boys as joe hits the glass again bam a crinkling of glass }
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{you can do it!}
<A>__{joe hits again so does the creature as nelec runs out of ammo. that was never really hope anyway. joe hits again and crash! the window shatters! glass chunks rain down on the boys all covering their face cary seeing the creature starting to enter the bus }
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{go! joe, move!!!}
<A>__{with all the boys helping, joe pulls himself up outside the bus, joe peeks out the fucking creature its back to joe just fifteen feet away, focused on the door and joe strains to climb out here, onto the top side of the bus. and as the boys climb out, the creature climbs in first joe, then charles (ad lib dialogue with cary and martin: "you gotta lose some weight " "i know!!!"), then cary, and martin last they all jump down to the dirt they hear screams and turn back for a moment inside the bus, nelec watches as the creature enters the tight fitting bus, smashing benches, making its way terrifyingly down the aisle toward him. and as the creature descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified:}
<C>__{nelec}
<D>__{ it was my turn once... to find you. now... it's your t }
<A>__{before he can finish, the creature fucking attacks and it would be horrible and brutal, if the blood didn't spray upon the bulletproof glass which our camera is safely behind }
<B>__{obscuring the nightmarish view.}
<A>__{in the field, a distance away, the boys watch the bus shudder and shake. then... silence. they see the creature burst out of the bus then run off fast and stealthy, away from them in the overgrown grass, like a native hunter. which, of course, is partly what it is. they're sort of stunned.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i just sharteezed a little.}
