<L>__{interior laundry room morning}
<A>__{a hand turns off a radio, shutting off the morning news. a small dog with two different colored eyes sticks his head out of the dryer, where he plays with the newly dried clothes. lynn sear reaches in and pulls out a blouse. she shakes it in the air and slips it on as she dresses hurriedly for work. lynn is a woman in her late twenties. one hundred percent south philly. hair teased. she chews on an early morning piece of trident. under all of it, lynn sear is an attractive and sweet looking young woman. lynn enters the kitchen through a swinging door. a bowl of cereal and milk sit on a table in an empty kitchen. lynn stares at a handful of kitchen cabinets and drawers that are open. lynn shakes her head.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{cole.}
<A>__{she closes them one at a time before moving to the coffee machine. lynn shivers a little. she leans over the thermostat and raises the heat. she returns to her post at the coffee machine.}
<B>__{tiny footsteps.}
<A>__{lynn turns to see cole standing in his private school uniform.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{your cocoa puffs are getting soggy.}
<A>__{lynn walks over to cole. checks his tie.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you got a spot.}
<A>__{lynn unclips the tie. cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as lynn walks back into the laundry room. the dog is gone now. lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a new tie. she finds one, then turns and steps back into the kitchen and screams at the top of her lungs. every cabinet and every drawer is wide open. cole sits at the kitchen table. his hands are pressed flat on the tabletop. he looks shaken. neither says anything for a beat.}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(shaken)}
<D>__{something you were looking for, baby?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(shaken)}
<D>__{pop tarts.}
<A>__{lynn looks over to the open cabinet near the sink. the pop tarts are clearly visible.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{they're right here.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{cole gets up from the table. takes his pop tarts. doesn't make eye contact.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{what are you thinking, momma?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{lots of things.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{anything bad about me?}
<A>__{lynn leans down.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{look at my face.}
<A>__{cole does.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i wasn't thinking anything bad about you, got it?}
<A>__{he looks at her eyes. beat.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{got it.}
<B>__{the door bell rings.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{that's tommy, momma.}
<A>__{cole quietly kisses his mother on the cheek and starts out.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{don't you want this?}
<A>__{cole turns to see lynn holding the pop tarts. he walks back and takes them from her before leaving. beat. lynn glances to the kitchen table. her gaze stops on the two tiny hand prints of sweat formed on the table's surface. lynn stands motionless in the kitchen. she looks up and wraps her arms around her shivering shoulders.}
