<L>__{exterior zambesi river the following day}
<A>__{early morning. the sparkling waters of the zambesi are lined by thick jungle. sounds of screeching gibbons, exotic birds, chattering insects, and various other wildlife echo from the jungle. bright rays of hot sunlight sprinkle through the leaves of the towering palm trees. a 55 foot, tattered, wooden river boat, the "adobo", travels along the zambesi. the boat is filled with various crates and barrels of supplies. and there are several men, crew members, all natives of mozambique. they are a motley crew, all armed with swords and daggers. they are dirty. tattered. unkempt. the boat pulls a long, wooden raft behind it. scraggy's model t is attached to the raft. one of the crew members, a young man, sits on the raft. he strums a beaten guitar, singing a folk song. indiana stands at the ship's steering wheel. forehead covered with sweat. he guides the ship along the twisting waters. clare exits from a cabin, carrying a stenographer's notebook. she looks radiant. her red hair shimmers in the morning sun. clare walks up beside indy. she crinkles her nose.}

<D>__{what is that awful aroma?}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{scraggy's takin' a shower.}
<A>__{indy points off screen. scraggy, fully clothed, stands here. he rubs a large, fresh onion over his face, arms and legs. squeezing the onion juice over his body. indiana explains to a befuddled clare.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{he believes that onions keep bad spirits from entering his body.}
<C>__{clare}
<P>__{(writing in her notebook)}

<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{look, clare... betsy's just an anxious archeology student...she admires my work...}
<P>__{(egotistical shrug)}
<D>__{who can blame her?...}
<P>__{(back to his point)}
<D>__{but it's just some kinda' hero worship thing...}
<A>__{there was never any romance.}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(pops in from off screen, kisses indiana)}
<D>__{i dreamed about our first night together!}
<A>__{indy sighs. clare disgustingly shakes her head. she continues to scrawl more into her notebook. indiana gives her a startled look.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{you're writin' this down?...}
<C>__{clare}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i'm keeping an accurate record of our journey.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{what's that got to do with my personal life?}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{evidence. i plan on testifying at your child molestation trial.}
<A>__{indiana shakes his head. staring into the distance. he sighs.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{why do i do this to myself?}
<A>__{holding her head in pain, betsy turns to clare.}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(holds her head in pain, to clare)}
<D>__{hey, lady...you're s'posed to be a doctor...you got any cures for a hangover?...}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{the best i've heard was used by a new zealand tribe...}
<P>__{(pauses, thinking)}
<D>__{one part crushed owl skull...two parts rhino saliva...one part zebra dandruff.}
<A>__{betsy's face becomes pale. indy interrupts.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{no, no... get a cup of donkey sweat ...two spoons of skunk hair...and one pint of shredded lizard tongue.}
<A>__{betsy turns a light shade of green. scraggy argues.}
<C>__{scraggy}
<D>__{i always use family cure! two spoons chopped leeches... half cup horse mucous...two quarts crocodile urine!}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(ready to throw up)}
<D>__{ex...cuse...me...!}
<A>__{betsy runs off screen. the others exchange a shrug. scraggy looks at the river ahead.}
<C>__{scraggy}

<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{almost 20 miles.}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{any sign of the nazis?}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(shakes his head, confident)}
<D>__{long as we keep up this pace... they'll have trouble tracking us.}
<A>__{camera pans from the hopeful faces of indiana, scraggy and clare, to the cabin behind them. here, a crew member hides in the shadows. his face hidden. he holds a small radio receiver. he whispers into the receiver. speaking in perfect german.}
