<P>__{(walla)}
<D>__{there are no eggs. there's none anywhere. i give up. come on, let's go. i don't understand.}
<A>__{bunny checks the eggs in his basket, then looks back toward the kids.}
<C>__{british girl}
<D>__{maybe he just hid them really well this year.}
<A>__{bunny, egg basket in hand, approaches a group of kids who seem to be wandering around searching halfheartedly, disappointed and listless.}
<C>__{bunnymund }
<D>__{kids! oi!}
<C>__{british boy}
<D>__{i checked everywhere! there's nothing!}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<P>__{(steps towards them)}
<D>__{yes there is! there is! i mean these aren't my best lookin' googies, but they'll do in a pinch!}
<A>__{he holds out a broken easter egg. the kids just stare.}
<C>__{british girl}
<D>__{i can't believe it.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{british girl}
<D>__{there's no such thing as the easter bunny.}
<A>__{the girl turns to leave.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{british kids }
<P>__{(walla)}
<D>__{easter's over. forget this.}
<A>__{it's only then that we realize he's too late. the spark of childhood has already been extinguished in all of them.}
<D>__{guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 93.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{no! wrong! not, not true! i'm right in front of ya, mate!}
<C>__{british kids}
<P>__{(walla)}
<D>__{there's no such thing. i know.}
<A>__{the kids walk through bunnymund as if he were a ghost. bunny is stunned by this, and finally realizes...}
<D>__{british kids (o.s.) (cont'd)}
<P>__{(walla)}
<D>__{now come on. i don't understand. why wouldn't he come? let's get out of here. easter bunny, where are you? this is the worst easter ever.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{they don't see me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they don't see me.}
<A>__{jack's watching this all unfold and it's heartbreaking, because he knows it's his fault. tooth flies to bunny's side. jack hears a rustle in the bushes behind him.}
<C>__{north }
<D>__{jack, where were you?}
<A>__{jack sees north, with his scimitars drawn and having just come from battle. he's exhausted, wild eyed, distraught.}
<C>__{north }
<D>__{the nightmares attacked the tunnels. they smashed every egg, crushed every basket. nothing made it to the surface.}
<C>__{tooth }
<D>__{jack!}
<A>__{tooth rejoins the group from off screen.}
<C>__{tooth }
<P>__{(gasps)}
<D>__{where did you get that?}
<A>__{jack looks down at the tooth box in his hand, then back to tooth.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i was...it's... guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 94.}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{where's baby tooth?}
<P>__{(feeling betrayed)}
<D>__{oh jack, what have you done?}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{that is why you weren't here?}
<A>__{north steps forward to confront jack.}
<C>__{north }
<D>__{you were with pitch?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, listen, listen...i'm sorry. i didn't mean for this to happen.}
<C>__{bunnymund }
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{he has to go.}
<A>__{jack turns to see bunny, disheartened.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(stunned beat)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{we should never have trusted you!}
<P>__{(forlorn)}
<D>__{easter is new beginnings, new life. easter is about hope.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and now it's gone.}
<A>__{bunny turns away and moves toward the park, looking at the sign that reads, `easter egg hunt.' this is like a punch in jack's gut. he looks back to tooth and north, both of whom look away, too hurt by jack. he looks at them with a pained expression. this is exactly what pitch said would happen. jack reaches into his pocket, pulls out the tiny russian nesting doll that north had given him, drops the doll to the ground, and takes off. as jack leaves, carried off by the wind, we see the tiny russian nesting doll laying on the ground.}
