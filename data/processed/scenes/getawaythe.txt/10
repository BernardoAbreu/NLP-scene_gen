<L>__{interior cell night}
<A>__{doc lies across a small cot within his shadow crossed cell. he works carefully at a toothpick suspension bridge. doc glues the final pieces into place... around the cubicle his personal effects can be seen, a picture of an attractive woman, several battered paperbacks. doc continues looking at the bridge... then suddenly begins smashing it to pieces with his right fist.}
