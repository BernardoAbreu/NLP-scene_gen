<L>__{interior day mrs. lewis' apartment}
<A>__{mrs. lewis is at least 80 years old, and almost blind behind her thick glasses. she lives alone in the small apartment that she used to share with her grandson. we sense that she is distraught by gary's death.}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{...my gary hadn't slept at home for three weeks. at first i figured he had found himself a girlfriend, so i didn't worry much about it... it's terrible. the policeman told me that he was living in the streets... they found his body in the subway. why? he had everything he needed here. every morning i would have his breakfast ready when he'd come home from work.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{did he use any drugs?}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{gary? huh huh! never... he was a good boy.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{did you notice anything different, the days prior to his leaving the house, anything unusual in his behavior?}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{oh yes, but that goes way back to when he started working at mayflower.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what kind of changes?}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{he didn't care much for anything anymore. before, we'd sit up and watch television together. but once he started that job as a night watchman, he'd spend all his time off locked up in his room...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{sleeping?}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{he hardly slept anymore... he was way too busy!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{busy doing what?}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{that, i don't know... i never knew what he was up to...}
<A>__{she reaches for a picture frame on the chest.}
<C>__{mrs. lewis }
<D>__{look, in this picture he was twelve years old...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{is that you standing next to him?}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{yes, back in the days...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{mrs. lewis, i found a note that gary wrote.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{a piece of paper, where he'd scribbled down the name, esseker... does that mean anything to you?}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{esseker, is that what you're saying?}
<A>__{the old lady dwells on it for a moment }
<C>__{mrs. lewis }
<D>__{no, that don't mean a thing to me...}
<A>__{she sets down the picture frame.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{may i see his room?}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{yes, of course. come, follow me, it's down the hallway, the door at the very end.}
<A>__{ben follows mrs. lewis to her grandson's room it looks nothing like the room of a fifty year old man, but rather like that of an old teenager. from what we can see, gary grew up in here, and each object recalls a stage in his life. everything is clean and in its proper place, it is perfectly tidy.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{do you mind if i stay in here for a moment?}
<A>__{mrs. lewis smiles at him. she too, likes to gather her thoughts in gary's room. ben scrutinizes the room in search of a clue, a hint that might help him on the esseker lead. he opens the drawers and looks through the papers nothing is of any help to him. the only place left that he hasn't searched is the walk in closet, whose half open doors seem to invite him to enter... what ben discovers inside is beyond anything he could ever have imagined the closet has been emptied out completely, and mirrors cover each and every wall, from the floor to the ceiling! it's a miniature replica of the hidden room that ben discovered back in the basement of the department store...}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{he would spend hours looking at himself...}
<A>__{mrs. lewis steps up behind him }
<C>__{mrs. lewis }
<D>__{to look at oneself too much is a sin. a terrible sin. do you know sir in the garden of eden in order to seduce eve, satan did not keep the appearance of a snake... satan reproduced the young woman's traits in such a way that eve would only see and listen to the image of herself... as in a mirror.}
