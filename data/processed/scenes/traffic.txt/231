<L>__{interior caroline's bedroom night}
<A>__{robert is standing in the middle of her room. he's not sure what he's looking for. everywhere he looks: her personal things, beloved objects from more innocent times, pictures. within moments a legitimate desire to connect with his daughter has escalated into a search for clues. he opens her drawers, dumps little boxes, pulls things off of shelves. he becomes increasingly unhinged, flinging things around her room. he tosses a stack of magazines. a fashion magazine, airborne, discharges some contents: a lighter, a plastic tube and a piece of folded aluminum foil fluttering to the ground. robert stares at the foil on the carpet. it's charred on the outside. he picks it up. and unfolds it. there's a dried milky white substance. he picks up the tube and lighter and stares at them. then, somewhat tentatively, he puts the tube in his mouth. he holds the lighter under the foil, then heats the milky substance which turns translucent and disappears in a cloud of smoke. robert sucks all of it in. he waits a long time then exhales. his eyes shut. the tube drops from his mouth. he staggers and, overwhelmed by the sensations, sits on the bed. the lighter and foil fall from his hands. a moment later he opens his eyes and doesn't seem to know where he is. he looks at the room, confused. he stumbles to the door and shuts it firmly behind him.}
