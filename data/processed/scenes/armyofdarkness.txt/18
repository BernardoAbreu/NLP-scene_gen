<A>__{a striking, blonde haired maiden, rushes into frame. she searches the faces of arthur's warriors and grows concerned. she pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to arthur atop his horse.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{m'lord arthur! where is my brother? did he not ride with you?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{eye. and fought valiantly. but last night fell in battle to duke henry's men.}
<B>__{sheila}
<A>__{her face does not immediately register the grief. she attempts to step forward but stumbles. she steadies herself against the stone wall. her eyes harden as she sees the first of the shackled prisoners: a semi conscious ash. she flushes with anger and races up to him. she spits and kicks at him as he's dragged along.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{foul thing! a pox on your throat! thou art a murderer! a black murderer!}
<B>__{village women}
<A>__{restrain her.}

<A>__{cries as the village women attempt to soothe her.}
<D>__{village woman #1 may you be consoled by their suffering in the pit.}
<A>__{the procession, ash and the four other prisoners halt. iron keys rattle. the shackles are unlocked. ash and the prisoners rub their reddened wrists. they are pushed at swordpoint towards a circular iron grate that sits atop the ground. this is the pit.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{looks to the jeering villagers that surround the pit, wondering what they have in store for him.}

<A>__{address the doomed men:}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{there is an evil that has awakened in this land. and whilst my people fight for their very souls against it, you, duke henry the red, wage war on us. your people are no better than the foul corruption that lies in the bowels of that pit! may god have mercy on your souls.}
<A>__{two of arthur's men crank a massive wench. chains tighten and the heavy iron lid slides back, revealing a dark hole. the pit.}
<B>__{from the bowels of the iron grated pit}
<A>__{a echoed wailing rises up. ash, henry and the other prisoners stiffen in fear.}
<B>__{an old woman amongst the jeering crowd}

<A>__{henry's warrior #1 as he's thrown down into the pit. he disappears into the blackness.}
<B>__{camera pans and halts close on ash}
<A>__{watching with disbelief. we hear the warrior's echoed cry of terror, then a splash as he hits bottom.}
<B>__{close on the edge of the pit}
<A>__{looking down into the blackness we hear:}
<P>__{henry's warrior #1 (o.s.)}
<D>__{i beg of you... by all that's holy! lower a rope! lower... oh, for the love of god! no! no!!! aiiiiiiiieee!}
<A>__{the sound of ripping and scratching. the shriek of terror is cut short as...}
<B>__{a geyser of blood}
<A>__{erupts upward from the pit. then silence.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{is frozen in fear.}
<C>__{tower guard }
<D>__{there! he's escaping!}
<A>__{ash's terrified gaze jerks from the pit to... tracking shot henry's warrior #2 making a break for it! he's past the guards, heading for the open drawbridge.}
<B>__{the tower archers}
<A>__{spot him and fire arrows.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{ping! ping! they bounce off the warrior's armor. he's makes it to the open drawbridge when...}
<B>__{arthur}
<A>__{pulls back a iron arrow in his crossbow. zing! he lets it fly. camera swish pans with arrow... pan halts on henry's warrior #2 the iron arrow punctures the warrior's armor, pegging him to a wooden post. he dies standing.}
<B>__{the crowd}
<A>__{cheers. they turn their attention to the remaining prisoners: camera pans from their bloodthirsty faces to the next prisoner in line...}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{turns to arthur and in a desperate, cowardly plea:}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{hey, i never even saw these assholes before..}
<A>__{he spins to duke henry the red.}
<D>__{you gotta tell 'em you don't know me. we never met. tell him.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i do not believe that he shall listen.}
<B>__{the warriors}
<A>__{grab ash and shove him into the pit.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{tumbles down into the pit. he lands in a steaming pool of foul water at the pit's bottom. he stands and coughs out a mouthful of the rancid water. he looks about.}
