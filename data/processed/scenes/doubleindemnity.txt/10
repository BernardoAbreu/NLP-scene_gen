<A>__{b 1 interior neff's office (night) neff sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone. on the desk next to him stands a used record. the cylinder on the dictaphone is not turning. he is smoking a cigarette. he kills it then lifts the needle and slides off the record which is on the machine and stands it on end on the desk beside the other used record. he reaches down painfully to take another record from the rack beneath the dictaphone, looks at it against the light to make sure it has not been used, then slides it into place on the machine and resets the needle. he lifts the horn and resumes his dictation.}

<D>__{a couple of nights later i went to the house. everything looked fine, except i didn't like the witness phyllis had brought in. it was dietrichson's daughter lola, and it made me feel a little queer in the belly to have her right there in the room, playing chinese checkers, as if nothing was going to happen.}
