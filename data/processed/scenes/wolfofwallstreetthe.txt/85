<P>__{(to donnie)}
<D>__{what're you saying, buddy?}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{shhhh... listen to him...}
<C>__{donnie}
<D>__{ssshhhhoes... shhhoooess...}
<A>__{jordan suspects donnie may actually be onto something. but just then...}
<C>__{sea otter}
<D>__{holy fuck.}
<A>__{jordan peers over the balcony where sea otter's looking. naomi lapaglia. 22, the hottest blonde ever, has entered the party with her date blair. she smiles, full lips parting over perfect white teeth, a ridiculously short dress barely covering her long tan legs and full breasts.}
<C>__{rugrat}
<D>__{my nutsack's about to explode.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{someone's gotta take that down.}
<A>__{there's no debate who that someone should be. eyes locked on naomi, jordan makes his way downstairs. with naomi taking in the party, her eyes flitting to things: art, chandeliers, crystal, etc.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{a lotta people would look at me and think: "golddigger, she's out to land the richest husband she can." but you see, i came from nothing. like, below the poverty line. and when you come from nothing, being rich means never having to go back to that.}
<A>__{jordan approaches cristy, 20s, one of his guests.}
<C>__{cristy}
<D>__{jordan, hey.}
<P>__{(he smiles; cristy picks up his intent)}
<D>__{have you met my friend naomi?}
<A>__{jordan takes naomi's hand, doesn't let go.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{naomi.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{you have an awesome house. i don't think i've ever been in a house like this.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you like it? i just got it. i guess it's okay. six bedrooms, two hot tubs, one off the master suite overlooking the water. you like to jet ski?}
<A>__{naomi's date blair offers his hand to break them apart. toby welch lurks behind him, giving him the evil eye.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{hi. blair hollingsworth.}
<A>__{jordan barely acknowledges him, focused on naomi. outside, hildy azoff chats with teresa. her eyes stray to jordan chatting up naomi. teresa's eyes follow hers and sees them. ouch. hildy goes.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you're telling me you've never jet ski'ed in your life?!}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{never.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{y'know, we really should hit it, there's two other parties we're s'posed to get to }
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{what? you just got here. stay.}
<A>__{naomi looks like she'd like to. hildy approaches, introduces herself, then:}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{jordan, teresa needs your help.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{with what?}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{i dunno, you'll have to ask your wife what she wants.}
<A>__{jordan sees: teresa is watching from afar.}
<C>__{donnie}
<D>__{oh sweet jesus!}
<A>__{jordan turns to see a drunk donnie, cock in hand, jerking off to naomi. hildy comes running over.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{donnie! what the fuck are you doing?!}
<A>__{during the melee that follows hildy admonishing donnie, blair removing naomi from the party }
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{the day i met naomi was the day i truly became the wolf. every guy wanted her so i had to have her.}
<A>__{ jordan watches her go. naomi shoots a glance back to him and, like that, he's hooked.}
