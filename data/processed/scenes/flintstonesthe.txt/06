<L>__{interior flintstone kitchen day}
<A>__{five year old pebbles giggles at the table as fred and dino tumble into the room like frank buck and a lion. wilma turns at the noise. one look at her and we under stand fred's romantic turn.}
<C>__{radio woodpecker }
<D>__{in other news, bedrock police report that the xenosaurus has struck again! yes, the fiercesome intruder was sighted in the bedrock hills for the third time this month. outlying shops and residencies report extensive looting and property destruction...}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{fred, stop playing with dino and sit down. your breakfast's getting cold.}
<A>__{saying this, wilma puts a huge egg at fred's place. meanwhile, fred manages to get to his feet, holds out one arm to keep dino at bay. fred does a big "take," looking out the window }
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(throwing open the door)}
<D>__{oooh, dino, look there's a nice big dino bone laying out on the front lawn !}
<A>__{pause. dino gives him a big look as if to say, "oh, yeah?"}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(trying again)}
<D>__{ gosh, look at that adorable little female dino }
<A>__{"yi yi yi yi," dino is out the door like a rocket. fred cackles, slams it shut, then sits down at the table.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{ that animal's gonna kill me with kindness. do you know we're out of dino treats?}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{so is everybody else in bedrock. that kibble crisis is getting worse every day.}
<A>__{she puts two giant slices of bread into a toaster. two claw like devices hold the toast, pulling it out of sight.}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{i'm afraid dino's going to have to manage on leftovers from pebbles and me.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(sitting down)}
<D>__{and what's wrong with my leftovers?}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{i will let you know when i see some.}
<C>__{radio woodpecker }
<P>__{(finishing up)}
<D>__{... scientists from b.c. university report that the footprints of the xenosaurus match no known animal.}
<C>__{pebbles}
<D>__{mommy, is the bad ze ze zenosaurus gonna get me and eat me up?}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{of course not, baby.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{that's right, sweetheart. the only thing that's gonna eat you up is me!}
<A>__{and he grabs her and bites her and tickles her.}
<C>__{pebbles}
<P>__{(giggling, calming)}
<D>__{i'm still a little scared...}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{pebbles, don't worry. these stories are very exaggerated. like, you know, the boogyman? there's no such thing as a huge, inhuman reptile that attacks without warning }
<A>__{wham! dino reappears, bounding through the window and knocking fred onto the floor. once again dino is happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously unresponsive owner. fred struggles to avoid the slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill, looks out.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{ oh, look, everybody, the mailman is here }
<A>__{"yi yi yi yi!" dino buys it again, runs to the door, lets himself out. this time fred puts a chair against the door. meanwhile, wilma turns at the sound of the toaster popping up. we see that the "claws" we saw earlier were the actual claws of a lobster in a little fireproof suit who is tucked inside the toaster. as wilma takes the toast, the lobster blows on his claws, wincing, then looks towards the camera.}
<C>__{lobster}
<D>__{well, it beats working in a seafood restaurant...}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(taking the toast)}
<D>__{thanks, wilma...}
<A>__{fred slaps jelly on the toast, takes a big bite, and then something outside the window catches his eye. his pov street a paperboy on a wood and stone bicycle is coming rapidly towards the house. in the bike's basket is a stack of dried, rock hard clay tablets.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{fred leans out the window, waving his hands.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{arnold! arnold! don't aim at the house please, not at the house }
<A>__{wham! fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams into the window frame, smashing a flowerpot, taking out a chunk of wall, and continuing diagonally through the kitchen and out another window. fred follows this action in time to see his driveway through the other window the rock paper drops like a foul shot, rips through the canvas roof of fred's car, and then bangs a huge dent in the hood.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{fred sighs, turns back to his breakfast.}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{lucky it wasn't the sunday paper.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(slight smile)}
<D>__{yeah. what else can go wrong?}
<A>__{he slices through the big egg with his knife releasing a baby pterodactyl which squawks and flaps, knocking fred over as it takes off through the window.}
