<A>__{shane and annabelle are in a close, after sex kind of cuddle thing. shane is unburdening himself.}

<D>__{... after that game, after being beaten that badly in front of the whole country, after humiliating myself, my team, my school, my family, i mean did you know that i set two sugar bowl records?! i was sacked eleven times! i threw six interceptions!}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{okay. calm down.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{anyway, after that, i could never seem to adjust in the pros. i was too scared. i lost my balls.}
<A>__{we see annabelle's hand move slightly under the covers.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{well, they're back.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{you know what i mean. my nerve. i lost the edge you need to play this game.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{i don't believe that. i don't think it just goes away. it was only one bad day, shane. everybody has those.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{no. somehow, i convinced myself that i couldn't ever win the big game. i got so down, that i was afraid to be playing when a game was on the line. i was afraid to screw up. that's the sure sign of a loser. from there, it wasn't very far to thinking that i will never win, that i didn't deserve to win at anything. including love.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{you're wrong. you're winning now. you're winning me.}
<A>__{they kiss real good.}
