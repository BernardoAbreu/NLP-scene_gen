<A>__{the canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across the river filtering the sun. the forest itself has grown darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers. strange birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes a huge snake slips along an overheading limb. the depth of the jungle is dark, ominous yet cool and strangely inviting.}

<A>__{suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls upon the boat. it is the shadow cast by an enormous vertical tail section of a b 52 bomber thrusting out from the mud. pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi dizing in the sun. creepers have already started to grow up around its heights the jungle is claiming it. but once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. a gateway to paradise. the river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and seductive. the hills beyond are purple and lush. strange orange colored water fowl swim lazily out of their way. the water itself is glass smooth and black as if there were no bottom. the sun is warm and the breeze gentle and laced with wild gardenians. it is indeed the most peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon it and has never known such a sense of peace and well being. each man in his heart feels a need to stay his soul cries to stop stop their madness this spiral into hell. here is all that can be had of earth. but no hand moves. the boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of the clearing. a hole into the jungle from which a darkness permeats. the boat follows the river into this hole.}
