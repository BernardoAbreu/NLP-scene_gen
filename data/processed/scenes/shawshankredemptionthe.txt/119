<L>__{int guard desk warden's outer office day (1955)}
<A>__{dozens of parcel boxes litter the floor. wiley, the duty guard, picks through them. hadley enters, trailed by andy.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{what is all this?}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{you tell me, fuck stick! they're addressed to you, every damn one!}
<A>__{wiley thrusts an envelope at andy. andy just stares at it.}
<C>__{wiley}
<D>__{well, take it.}
<A>__{andy takes the envelope, pulls out a letter, reads:}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{dear mr. dufresne. in response to your repeated inquiries, the state senate has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project... "}
<P>__{(stunned, examines check)}
<D>__{this is two hundred dollars.}
<A>__{wiley grins. hadley glares at him. the grin vanishes.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{in addition, the library district has generously responded with a charitable donation of used books and sundries. we trust this will fill your needs. we now consider the matter closed. please stop sending us letters. yours truly, the state comptroller's office.}
<A>__{andy gazes around at the boxes. the riches of the world lay at his feet. his eyes mist with emotion at the sight.}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{i want all this cleared out before the warden gets back, i shit you not.}
<A>__{hadley exits. andy touches the boxes like a love struck man touching a beautiful woman. wiley grins.}
<C>__{wiley}
<D>__{good for you, andy.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{only took six years.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{from now on, i send two letters a week instead of one.}
<C>__{wiley}
<P>__{(laughs, shakes his head)}
<D>__{i believe you're crazy enough. you better get this stuff downstairs like the captain said. i'm gonna go pinch a loaf. when i get back, this is all gone, right?}
<A>__{andy nods. wiley disappears into the toilet, jughead comix in hand. alone now, andy starts going through the boxes like a starving man exploring packages of food. he doesn't know where to turn first. he gets giddy, ripping boxes open and pulling out books, touching them, smelling them. he rips open another box. this one contains an old phonograph player, industrial gray and green, the words "portland public school district" stenciled on the side. the box also contains stacks and stacks of used record albums. andy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping through them. used nat king coles, bing crosbys, etc. he comes across a certain album mozart's "le nozze de figaro." he pulls it from the stack, gazing upon it as a man transfixed. it is a thing of beauty. it is the grail.}
