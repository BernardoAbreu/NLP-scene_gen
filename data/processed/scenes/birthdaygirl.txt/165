<A>__{on the other side of the airport, john stands in front of the exit to the taxi ranks. he's got nowhere to go. passengers swirl around him. he looks at the binocular in his hands. he removes the binoculars and looks at them. suddenly he stops. in the case is a folded note marked john. john holds it in his hands slowly, deliberately, he screws it up, and drops it in the case like a bin.}

<A>__{through the binoculars. passengers criss cross, but we find nadia sitting alone, waiting for her call. john lowers the binoculars and gazes across the airport. he raises them for one last look. nadia, glimpsed through the crowd. we spy someone standing about twenty feet behind her. it is alexei. we watch alexei approach her. she looks up and is completely thrown. yuri stands about ten feet away, in shades. john lowers the binoculars, horrified. he looks again. nadia pulls her arm away. alexei crouches down in front of her and puts a hand on her knee, coaxing her. alexei takes her by the arm and leads her away.}
