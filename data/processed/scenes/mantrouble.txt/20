<L>__{interior joan's apartment day}
<A>__{helen, now captive to andy's epic, is seated next to her on the couch, attempting to listen politely to a tale without an end:}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{and to top it off, my lawyer said, 'don't worry, they're just pissing into the wind...'}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{uhm hmm.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{and i said, they're pissing into the wind but it's blowing back in my face...}
<A>__{joan has reentered the room and approaches them.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{some help i'm going to get from him, because he's scared to death of red.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{andy, are you telling me the truth?}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(turning to joan)}
<D>__{yes, he's afraid, they're all afraid, they're all off skiing.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{speaking of lawyers...}
<P>__{(tapping on her cast)}
<D>__{one fell on me while i was sunbathing.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i mean, are you really going to new york?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{yes, i'm going to new york, where i intend to remain in semi private seclusion, at an undisclosed...}
<C>__{joan}

<C>__{andy}
<D>__{wait, i just want you to hear what this colosal shit said about me, through his great white shark of a lawyer.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{pardon me, but i don't care what he said. my apartment, as you can see, is a complete shambles, i have a terrible headache, i've been informed that somebody doesn't like me, and i really don't want to stay here by myself!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{fine, why don't you take my house then?}
<A>__{joan sinks down into a chair, exhausted:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{gee whiz, why make such a big deal out of everything?}
<C>__{andy }
<P>__{(to helen)}
<D>__{i just got off a plane that almost fell into the pacific ocean like a piece of rotten fruit...}
<P>__{(to joan)}
<D>__{... but did i mention it?}
