<C>__{isabel}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{lemarc knew when to get out. he just quit...with his perfect record intact. now he's a legend.}
<P>__{(exhorting)}
<D>__{don't do this.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{lemarc quit because he was 75 years old, isabel. he was tired. his doctor told him if he didn't start taking it easy he was going to have another heart attack. you're dramatizing it.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{you don't know why lemarc retired, any better than i do. you have no idea.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{actually, i do. i know exactly why.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{really? how's that?}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{he told me.}
<C>__{isabel}
<P>__{(skeptical as hell)}
<D>__{you know lemarc?}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{a little.}

<D>__{you }
<A>__{she's so mad she can hardly speak.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{you knew lemarc? you knew lemarc and never told me? that's the worst thing you've ever done to me. nobody knows more about lemarc than me. how could you do that?}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{i couldn't tell you, then.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{really awful.}
<A>__{isabel thinks.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{then why aren't you as good as toulour?}
<A>__{rusty shrugs. a beat.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{i don't want to arrest you, robert. i really don't. but i will if you make me. i will if you go for that egg.}
<A>__{rusty goes silent, looks out at the lights of the city.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{so many times, i waited. you can't do that to a person.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{isabel }
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{i have to go.}
<A>__{isabel gets up...walks away fast. she's barely holding herself together. rusty watches her go. several seconds, then: flashback interior apartment building rome day rusty carries a huge bouquet of flowers up the stairs to the front door of his apartment with isabel. it's a perfect sunny day outside. he unlocks the door quietly and swings it open to see the apartment is bare. the furniture is still there. but nothing else. nothing on the walls or the shelves. isabel has clearly moved out. rusty's whole body reacts.... he slowly looks around him, as if in a dream. his eye goes to the dining room table. isabel's engagement ring is there. back to scene exterior rome campidoglio night rusty is still watching isabel, small now in the distance. she turns the corner out of sight.}
