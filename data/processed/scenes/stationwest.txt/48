<T>__{dissolve:}
<L>__{exterior mountain country night}
<A>__{the stage is now heading uphill, the gentle slope at the beginning of the foothills.}
<L>__{exterior mountain country night}
<A>__{the road is steeper now, and winding. another angle. the road is cut out of the side of the mountain, leaving a sheer slope on one side, and high, thick trees and brush on the other. as the stage follows a bend in the road, a rider leaps out and grabs the lead horse. the stage lurches crazily and almost overturns as it slows to a stop. before haven can free his hands from the reins to go for his gun, two shadowy figures, handkerchiefs helping the darkness mask their faces, have jumped out onto the road ahead and have him covered.}
<C>__{bandit}
<D>__{all right stretch!}
<A>__{haven and goddard raise their arms. another bandit, from the hillside, calls out:}
<C>__{second bandit}
<D>__{pile out with the hands up.}
<A>__{two shotgun barrels cover the side of the stags. goddard gets off, hands in air.}
<C>__{first bandit}
<P>__{(to haven)}
<D>__{get down.}
<A>__{haven obeys, to join goddard in the road, as the bandits converge on the stage. there are five or six of them. two come up behind haven and goddard.}
<C>__{first bandit}
<D>__{turn around and keep 'em high.}
<A>__{the sacks are being loaded on a pack horse. haven turns around.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{take it easy. they hang you just the same.}
<C>__{second bandit}
<D>__{you, goddard, start walking.}
<A>__{he gives goddard a none too gentle shove. goddard moves on up the road in the darkness. a few yards up the road. mick is waiting by his horse, his gun drawn. we hear the steps of goddard and the bandit.}
<C>__{second bandit's voice}
<D>__{that's far enough.}
<A>__{the footsteps halt. mick aims and fires. by wagon. there is a half grunt, half groan from goddard. haven turns as if to protest and then crumples as a gun fells him. close shot haven, lying face down on the ground, unconscious.}
