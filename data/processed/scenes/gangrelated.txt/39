<L>__{interior capt. henderson's office day}
<A>__{captain henderson is sitting behind his desk. divinci and rodriguez are in front of him. rodriguez is trying to hide his nervousness. divinci is absolutely cool.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{this is our case! not the goddamn dea's!}
<C>__{capt. henderson}
<D>__{it's been three days.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{we're not fuckin' magicians! what the hell is three days?! this is a goddamn murder case! it takes a little bit of goddamn time!}
<C>__{capt. henderson}
<D>__{when a federal undercover officer goes down, it's never a fuckin' murder case! i don't like the dea on my ass any better than you like 'em on yours. but this is personal for them and they want answers. forget your other cases and get something, anything that i can give to them. the last thing i want is the goddamn f.b.i. on my back, too.}
<A>__{divinci and rodriguez are quiet for a beat, then }
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{we've got a couple leads. we need a little more time.}
<C>__{capt. henderson}
<D>__{i can't hold 'em off much longer.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{this is no fuckin' way to run an investigation.}
<C>__{capt. henderson}
<D>__{let me tell you both something, if you don't solve this quick, they're gonna start askin' why? and they'll be lookin' to blame somebody in this department. so my advise to you is, get something fuckin' fast or turn over what you've got and get outa the way.}
<A>__{rodriguez and divinci are quiet for a moment, then }
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{how much time we got?}
<C>__{capt. henderson}
<D>__{a couple days. the funeral's this afternoon.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{what funeral?}
<C>__{capt. henderson}
<D>__{for agent hudd. simms wants you there.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{what for? we didn't know him.}
<C>__{capt. henderson}
<D>__{how the hell do i know?! it's dea, it's their thing. you're the cops on the case, i suppose they want you to know what a great guy hudd was so you'll work all that harder to find his killer. just go. it'll reassure 'em how much you care and keep 'em off my ass.}
