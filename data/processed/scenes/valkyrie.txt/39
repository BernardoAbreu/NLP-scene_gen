<L>__{exterior berlin street later}
<A>__{a truck full of soldiers roars past. stauffenberg, tresckow and fraulein oven walk across a dimly lit bridge on a foggy night in berlin, stopping in the middle. stauffenberg carries a leather valise with the valkyrie orders, tresckow carries the typewriter case. they stop at the center of the bridge, looking around carefully. no one is in sight, but anyone could be watching from the shadows. eerie.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<P>__{(to the fraulein)}
<D>__{if anyone comes to you, play ignorant. just tell them }
<C>__{fraulein oven}
<D>__{i will tell that i was serving the german people. then i will tell them to go to hell.}
<A>__{both men smile, a bit taken aback. von oven shakes each man's hand and walks away, swallowed up by the darkness. when she is gone:}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{to operation valkyrie.}
<A>__{stauffenberg nods. tresckow heaves the typewriter case over the railing and into the water below.}
<B>__{splash.}
<A>__{they watch in silence as the water settles, then:}
<C>__{tresckow }
<D>__{i've been transferred to the front.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me?}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{would you have stayed?}
<A>__{obviously not. then it occurs to stauffenberg.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{do you think fromm reported us?}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{it's more likely just... an unfortunate coincidence. anyway it doesn't matter. you wrote the orders. you know them better than anyone.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{you don't mean to say }
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{i'm appointing you military leader of the resistance. beck agrees.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{but olbricht }
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{we both know olbricht hasn't the wit or the spine. no. it's you.}
<A>__{a million thoughts are running through stauffenberg's mind. fear. anxiety. but he knows what he must do.}
<C>__{tresckow }
<D>__{one more thing. you were right what you said that first night. it's not enough to kill hitler. we need to isolate his chain of command. the slightest confusion could crush us. we need to be certain that no conflicting orders get out after the flash.}
<A>__{stauffenberg considers this for a moment.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{that greatly limits our options of where and when to make our move, but it's the only way.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{how will you do it?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{perhaps it's better i don't say.}
<A>__{pause. a sad smile and nod from tresckow, a moment ago he was in charge. now he has no clearance.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{god promised abraham that he would not destroy sodom if he could find just ten righteous men.}
<A>__{he puts a hand on stauffenberg's shoulder.}
<C>__{tresckow }
<D>__{i have a feeling that for germany it may come down to one.}
