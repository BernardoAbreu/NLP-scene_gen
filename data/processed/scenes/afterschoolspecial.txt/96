<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{johnson sounds like a moron.}
<C>__{mr. lewis}
<D>__{exactly!}
<A>__{mr. lewis is psyched that someone is finally paying attention to him. mrs. lewis doesn't like the way he's looking at her.}
<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{so, ashley. if i could ask you a personal question, exactly how old are you?}

<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{now's not a good time.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{what's wrong?}

<D>__{deacon, who is it?}
<A>__{too late. naomi comes in.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{hi, mrs. lewis. i'm naomi. i'm deacon's girlfriend.}

<C>__{mrs. lewis}
<D>__{his girlfriend?}
<A>__{she looks at deacon. max pokes his head through.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{deacon has two girlfriends?}

<A>__{deacon watches naomi go. ashley consoles him.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{let her go.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{are you insane? i've been fantasizing about naomi feldman since the seventh grade.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{fantasy and reality are two different things, deacon. don't fall in love with who you think she is. you have to be sure you love the real person.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{so what should i do?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{go after her then. or don't. whatever.}
<A>__{he looks at ashley for a beat, then goes after naomi.}
