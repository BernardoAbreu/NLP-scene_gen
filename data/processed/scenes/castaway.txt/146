<L>__{exterior beach night}
<A>__{chuck lies in his bed of palm fronds, shivering. he looks up at the stars, which blaze furiously.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{that's the big dipper...orion...or is that the southern cross...? kelly would know.}
<A>__{and he misses her so much. a shower of meteors streaks across the sky, as if the very heavens are raining down on chuck.}
<L>__{exterior beach day}
<A>__{chuck readies his two sticks of bamboo again and begins sawing with tremendous energy. he smells something. is it smoke? he pulls off the log and looks eagerly at the nest of tinder. there's nothing there.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{dammit!}
<A>__{he replaces the log and starts wearily to saw again.}
<B>__{time cut}
<A>__{the sun has moved in the sky. chuck is still sawing. again the smoke appears. again sweat pours from his face. the smoke increases. he saws even harder. his breath comes in anguished gulps. smoke is curling up now. chuck tears away the bamboo, picks up the nest of kindling, and blows on it gently. the smoke increases. he blows some more. a fragile crimson spark appears.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{careful now, careful...}
<A>__{he gently places the nest of shavings in the kindling, then blows on it with utmost care, as if he were holding life itself. he shreds his money and business cards over the tiny flame. suddenly, the evening breeze lifts the nest out of the kindling. desperate, chuck grabs it. trying to shield it with his body, he grabs some palm fronds and jams them into the sand, trying to make a windbreak. they rustle and shake and blow over. the wind blows harder. chuck jams some rocks in a circle to make an eddy. but the fire is out. no words now, just a loud, primal groan of pure despair. and then, into his vision floats...smoke. chuck looks down. a wisp of smoke curls up from the nest of tinder! chuck blows on it gently. suddenly a tiny tongue of flame flickers and catches on the kindling!}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{yes! yes! yes!}
<A>__{he feeds in some more twigs, more tinder. the flames lick out, catch, grow.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{if i ever forgot to thank you god, and i am sure i did, thank you now.}
