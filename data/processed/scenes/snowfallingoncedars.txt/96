<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{josiah gillanders folds his blunt, thick hands across his belly. nearly 50, sporting a walrus moustache and the watery, dull eyes of an alcoholic, he is a man ready to make the most of his fifteen minutes of fame.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{thirty years fishing alone. ever had an occasion to board another man's boat except in an emergency? maybe to socialize or some such?}
<C>__{gillanders }
<D>__{never. only boarded some fella's boat five, six times in thirty one years. dead engine, broken hip, only in need.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{now, mister gi...}
<C>__{gillanders}
<D>__{unwritten rule of the sea. we don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. ask anybody.}
<A>__{nels is wandering over to the jury box.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{now if you wanted to kill a man. think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?}
<C>__{gillanders}
<D>__{it's a joke. maneuver up to carl's boat? tie your lines fast? come aboard? all against carl's will? it's the stupidest suggestion i ever heard of.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{i'm sorry about that. it wasn't mine in the first place.}
<A>__{gentle laughter. even some on the jury.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{so the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?}
<C>__{gillanders}
<D>__{couldn't get on the boat. i'd just shoot the feller. then tie up, throw him inta th' drink. and skip bein' the first gill netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.}
<A>__{more laughter. hooks at his table. simply smiles.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{now the sheriff believed that the d 6 battery in carl's well was carl's own spare. even though it was too large f...}
<C>__{gillanders}
<D>__{no sense to have any at all., even the right size. it's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car. nobody does.}
<A>__{nobody. no way.}
<C>__{gillanders}
<D>__{boat has two batteries. lose one you run off the other til morning. carl musta lost both, so miyamoto there gave him one a his.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{course, if carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work. so how would he signal for help?}
<C>__{gillanders}
<D>__{compressed air horn, most likely. hope to god some man hears you in that fog.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{all right, what if the defendant heard ? so carl let him aboard, to help. and then the fishing gaff?}
<A>__{gillanders grins. wide.}
<C>__{gillanders}
<D>__{you mean miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker punched him?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{well, what if?}
<C>__{gillanders}
<D>__{now, how is miyamoto gonna know in advance ? that carl loses two batteries. must happen once ever' 20 years or so.}
<A>__{another chuckle or two from the gallery.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{thank you, mr. gillanders. thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.}
<C>__{gillanders}
<D>__{well, it does seem mighty warm in here. specially for mr. hooks.}
<A>__{and looks at the prosecutor. who rises, easily. a most polite fuck you smile. hooks strolls now. slow and steady. straight to the witness box. rests his hands on the rail. leans in.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{what if the defendant follows carl. and pretends his own batteries are dead? would carl tie up and help?}
<A>__{and the smile on gillander's face. stops. cold.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{is the word you're groping for...'yes', perha...}
<C>__{judge }
<D>__{alvin!}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{rephrase. do you agree that he might tie up to the defendant's bo...}
<C>__{gillanders}
<D>__{so why's the d 6 in carl's well?}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{who's to say? maybe it was just a spare, after all. or maybe the defendant left it, as a potential alibi. in case somebody saw him in ship channel bank.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{in case we put two and two together, knowing of the hostility. between the families.}
<A>__{gillanders. actually thinking about that.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{my question is. could carl have tied up to help the defendant?}
<A>__{a beat. a cleared throat.}
<C>__{gillanders}
<D>__{it coulda happened. and if i start to say it's doubtful, you'd probl'y say 'no further questions', right?}
<A>__{once more, laughter. enough to bring the gavel down.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{right about that. and right that it 'coulda happened'.}
<A>__{turns his back, walks away.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{thanks for your help. hope the witness box wasn't too warm for your comfort.}
<A>__{all eyes follow the prosecutor, as he sits. except for the defendant. his stare forward. recalling...}
