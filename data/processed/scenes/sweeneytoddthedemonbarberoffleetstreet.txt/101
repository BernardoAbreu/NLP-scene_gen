<A>__{a macabre vision of hell. the roof hangs low in this subterranean chamber. the grisly tools of her trade are scattered about the place: a large, stained chopping block; a meat grinder; buckets of questionable viscous liquid; cleavers and bone saws and meat hooks; wet sewer grates for the blood. a metal sheet, hinged at the top, has been attached to cover an opening in the wall: the mouth of the chute from the barber shop above. and eeriest of all ... the thundering roar of flame coming from a large industrial oven against one wall. toby takes in the cavernous bakehouse:}
