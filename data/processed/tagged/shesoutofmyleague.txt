<A>__{the agents take their places, manning the screening equipment. we push in on the bald man as he takes up his post next to the walk through metal detector. this is kirk kettner. he is not a looker. his uniform only serves to highlight his least attractive features but his eyes and demeanor are pleasant and kind. the scruffy agent is stainer. he stands at the x ray monitor. as the bags begin to move through, he does not pay any attention, rather he hands kirk a flyer.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{kirk, bro. tonight?}
<A>__{insert: the flyer reads, "wheel in the sky a tribute to journey at club vertigo every tuesday night!" stainer is pictured wearing a massive afro in the band photo.}

<D>__{i don't know, stainer.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{dude, you never come see us anymore. it's been like four months. time to forget about marnie and get back on the whores.}

<D>__{oh, shit. i spaced that. how's she doing?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{she's hanging in there but it doesn't look good.}

<A>__{more stares from more men and even a few women as we follow the legs to the check in line. the legs glide to the front and stop to wait for the next available ticket agent. from the slightly upward angle, we see two young male ticket agents. (one on each side of the legs.) one is black and one white; each are dealing with customers. they simultaneously notice our woman. they suspiciously eye one another and the race is on. each agent begins typing furiously to expedite their current customer in the hope of waiting on her nexterior angle on the white agent as he waits on a yuppie couple.}
<C>__{white agent}
<P>__{(rushed)}
<D>__{okay, how many bags are you checking? any bags!?}
<C>__{yuppie man}

<D>__{no. carry it on. good call.}
<C>__{yuppie woman}
<D>__{grant, you don't want to lug that thing all over the airport.}

<P>__{(rushed)}
<D>__{did you pack your bags yourself?}

<D>__{sank you!}
<C>__{black agent}
<D>__{no sweat. keep it moving.}
<A>__{the asian woman is not going anywhere. the black agent leans into her face and barks once like a dog. her smile turns to fear as she backs away, ending the race in a dead tie.}
<C>__{both agents}
<D>__{next!}
<A>__{reverse to show the woman they were competing for. she is a classy, sophisticated, blonde around thirty. drop dead beautiful. she is startled by the sudden call from both men. she laughs off her little scare and then randomly chooses the black agent. he shoots a smug victory grin over to his co worker, who is being an overtly sore loser.}

<D>__{why don't we go ahead and strip off that belt too while we're at it.}

<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{why don't you just come on through, ma'am, and we'll see if anything sets off the machine.}
<A>__{molly steps through. the machine does not go off. she gathers her things and mouths a silent, "thank you" to kirk as she walks on. fuller glares at kirk but before he can say anything, randy, a young agent, calls out from the office.}

<D>__{kirk buddy! phone call!}

<D>__{it's not even a real pizza hut. it's one of those strip mall take out ones. they don't even have chicken wings. the guy's a fuckin' douche bag.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{he's got more going on than i do. that's all i'm saying.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{dude, you can do a hell of a lot better than her.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{one door closes, another door opens.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{fuck you devon, that doesn't even make any sense. but take this broad that's coming here tonight i got a feeling about her. you're gonna get on that.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{absolutely. visualize it.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i appreciate what you guys are trying to do but, i'm telling you, i have zero chance with this one and i'm completely okay with that.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{that's defeatist thinking.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no it isn't. it's just like saying i will never go to the moon and i'm okay with that too.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{you're saying you don't want to go to the moon? that's bullshit.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no. i'm saying that i never will go to the moon but i'm not going to get down about it because, you know i never expected to.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{you don't know. technology and shit. you might go to the moon.}
<A>__{kirk waves to someone at the door. the guys look up. the guys' pov: molly is stepping toward them dressed in a beautiful gown. they laugh the way you might laugh at a particularly brutal football tackle.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{holy frijole.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh shit. yeah, you're right.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{sorry, bro. you'll go to the moon before you'll hit that. no chance.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i told you.}
<A>__{molly arrives at their table.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{hey! there you are!}
<A>__{molly hugs kirk. from across the bar, marnie takes notice.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{here i am.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i'm sorry i'm so overdressed. i just came from a work thing. are you doing okay with...everything?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, you know... hey, these are my best friends jack, devon and stainer.}
<A>__{the guys' i.q.s drop like stones as they shake her hand.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{stainer?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{yeah, just a nickname. doesn't really mean nothin'.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh. here's your pictures all safe and sound.}
<A>__{kirk hands molly the pictures.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{thank you so much for taking care of them for me! i need to get some copies made. if i lost these...uugh.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no trouble at all.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{hey, have you eaten yet?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{um...}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i was going to go grab a bite. let me buy you dinner to pay you back.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you don't have to pay me back.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i know. i want to. come on! the place across the street has the best greasy burgers in town.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{a burger does sound good. (then to the guys) i'm going to just ah...}
<A>__{molly waves goodbye and heads for the door. kirk starts to follow but stainer pulls him back for a quick huddle.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{dude. it's cool that she's buying you dinner but do not get your hopes up about this one.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{don't worry. believe me, i know.}
<A>__{kirk catches up with molly. marnie watches them exit. a big guy has overheard this and leans over to stainer.}
<C>__{big guy}
<D>__{good advice there friend. your boy ain't got a prayer with that chick.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{you talking shit about my buddy!? 'cause i'm giving out free fuckin' ambulance rides!}
<A>__{big guy assesses the crazy on stainer's face and stands down.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{yeah, i didn't think so!}
<L>__{interior burger joint night}
<A>__{kirk and molly sit across from one another in a booth. the waiter arrives.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{start you off with something to drink ma'am?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i will have a bass.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{and for your... brother?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what? oh, i'm not her brother.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. i just figured...}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you know what, a bass sounds good. make that two.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{great. sorry.}
<A>__{the waiter exits.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{so... you know what i do, what about you? your card said event planner. how'd you get into that?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{well, it wasn't the original plan. i went to law school. ended up at a big firm but i hated it. then, they asked me to plan the christmas party. it was a big hit and a few months later i was done with law.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{wow.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i know. pernicious career move, right?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, i don't know what that word means. what was it?}
<A>__{close on molly's smile. she finds kirk's unabashed admission very refreshing and endearing.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i'm sorry. like, destructive or...}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, okay. no, i don't think that's so perni...gious?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{pernicious.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{good new word. no, not pernicious at all. not if you enjoy the work.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i really do. we do a lot of charity events and i get to work with some of the most amazing human beings on some really fun projects. next month i'm doing a cancer benefit with billy joel.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{wow. i love billy joel.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{the only downside is i have to do a lot of public speaking and i've always struggled with stage fright.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh man that's my number one fear. i'm terrified of getting up in front of people. i'd rather get a kentucky root canal.}
<A>__{molly laughs. an older good looking man steps up to the table and stands facing her with his back to kirk.}
<D>__{good looking man excuse me, i was just sitting over at the bar and i was wondering; has anyone told you today that you are absolutely stunning?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{are you seriously hitting on me right in front of my boyfriend?}
<A>__{he turns to kirk and both men start to laugh.}
<D>__{good looking man this is your boyfriend?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, yeah right! (catches molly's unspoken instructions.) but, yeah. i'm her boyfriend, i guess, so... good looking man really? wow. well... sorry.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{honest mistake.}
<A>__{the man gives kirk a wink and wanders back to the bar.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{did you get a load of that hair piece? what is it with men? i mean, look at you. you're bald and you're fine with it. a little dignity is all i'm saying. the toupees and plugs and the teen dream sports cars... oh geeze, i'm sorry. do you drive a sports car?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i drive a 94 taurus. it's got am fm but i wouldn't call it a sports car per se.}
<A>__{molly laughs and we hard cut through the following snippets of conversation as they eat, chat and laugh.}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{so here's this little old lady trying to go through security with six pounds of weed in her girdle!}
<A>__{cut. the food is being served.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh, my god! i love that book!}
<A>__{cut. the waitress is picking up the empty plates.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{so, a duck walks into a bar...}
<A>__{cut. molly is laughing while she's paying the bill.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{well, i've got an early morning. i should go. thanks for coming along. this was really fun. and thanks again for helping me out.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no, thank you for dinner. i feel bad that you won't let me...}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh, stop it. listen, i handle some of the charity events for the coyotes and i've got some tickets for the hockey game tomorrow night. you interested?}
<A>__{kirk is a bit taken aback and confused. is she actually asking him out on a real date?}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{um, sure. yeah, great. i mean, i'm free tomorrow night.}
<A>__{she digs two tickets out of her purse and hands them over.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{perfect. i hate to see them go to waste. there's two so maybe bring stainer?}
<A>__{kirk's expression is as much relief as disappointment.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, right. thanks! thank you.}
<L>__{exterior hockey arena night}
<A>__{kirk and stainer are on their way through security. a huge security guard runs a metal detector wand over stainer.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{whatcha runnin' there a px 235?}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{i don't know sir.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{the two hundred series are dog shit. you couldn't find a bazooka with that thing. you should look into the new eight fifties.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{can you keep it moving sir?}
<L>__{interior hockey arena}
<A>__{kirk and stainer arrive at the third row to find two open seats right next to the penalty box. to kirk's surprise, in the next seat molly! kirk elbows stainer.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{hey, it's molly. she's here.}
<C>__{stainer}
<P>__{(perplexed)}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{hey guys! you made it! hooray! thanks for coming.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, yeah. wouldn't miss it.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{thanks for the sweet seats!}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{guys, this is my best friend in the whole world, patty. this is kirk and, um, stainer, right?}
<A>__{patty is over 200 pounds with a pretty face and an edge that comes from a lifetime of taking crap from morons.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{hey boys. nice to meet you.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{patty's my assistant and my go to gal. whatever you need, she can make it happen on a moments notice.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{you need a cock shaped cake with a cotton candy bush delivered by four o'clock? i'm your connection.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh, and she likes to shock people so don't let her freak you out.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{how 'bout that. so, we're going to grab some beers. can we bring you ladies anything? beer? nachos? patty, cotton candy?}
<L>__{interior hockey arena concessions area}
<A>__{stainer and kirk stand in the beer line.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{that's it. she's setting you up with the fat chick.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{ooohhh! okay! okay! that makes sense, right!? when molly was here i was like, "what!?" but, okay! well, patty seems cool. she's funny.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{well, yeah, she has to be.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{nothing. the fat chick seems great. you never know, bro, that fat chick could wind up being the love of your life.}
<A>__{kirk returns a look of annoyance.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{patty, i'm saying. patty could be the love of your life.}
<L>__{interior hockey arena}
<A>__{the game has started. kirk, stainer, molly and patty are cheering. the puck smacks the glass before them and another player skates up for it. as he mucks it from the edge, he looks up and sees molly. he's distracted just long enough to get brutally checked face first into the glass. a penalty is called on the player who hit him. that player skates into the penalty box near molly. the name on his jersey reads, "reese." he speaks with a thick canadian accent.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{hey molly! yer lookin' good, eh!}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{that was a bogus call, bobby. your skates barely left the ice.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{i know. what's that aboot, eh?}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(nervously to reese)}
<D>__{yeah, that ref is like a total blindo, man.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{blindo?}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{kirk, molly's sister is blind.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. i didn't mean...}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(not offended)}
<D>__{oh, i know. it's fine.}
<L>__{interior broadcast booth}
<A>__{the radio announcers are calling the game.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{forty five seconds left on the power play and the sharks are knocking at the door.}
<L>__{interior hockey arena}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{so, after the game, you wanna party?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you know my policy on players, bobby. and you might have noticed we've already got dates.}
<A>__{the penalty ends and the ref opens the box but reese is not paying attention.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{come on, molly. just give me a chance, eh. i'm a great guy ask any of these assholes.}
<A>__{the crowd is booing reese.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{reese, you'd better...}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{you can't seriously be blowing me off for these two hosers.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{hey! fuck you reese! you suck this year anyway!}
<A>__{reese raises his squirt bottle over the glass and squirts stainer.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{you dick!}
<A>__{stainer is immediately on his feet, climbing the glass and trying to pummel the huge player. security is on him in a flash and dragging him, kicking & swearing, out of the arena. reese wakes up and skates out of the box but it's too late. the sharks score and the crowd revolts. a red haired redneck woman, sitting two rows back, calls out to molly and company.}
<D>__{red haired woman you idiots just cost us a goal! i hope you're happy!}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{you'd better check that tone, reba! you do not want me comin' up there!}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{patty! stop it! i will go see what i can do about stainer.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no, this is my fault, i will take care of it.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{no, it's okay. i know the head of security. i will be right back.}
<A>__{molly exits and patty sits back down next to kirk.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{god, i'm really embarrassed.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{that's okay, if reese did that to me i'd have gone over the glass too. but i would have landed a few before they got me. reese has been all over molly ever since she dumped her boyfriend. i tell you, that girl has nothing but trouble when it comes to men.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what? how is that even possible? she's so...}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{tell me about it. i'm no lezbo but sometimes she makes me want to strap on if know what i'm saying.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yeah. i think i do.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{it's a curse, looking like that. who has the balls to hit on her? just the most arrogant a holes like reese out there.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yeah, i suppose.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{listen, molly brought me along tonight because, you know, she thought i might be 'interested.'}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh. oh yeah?}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{but, just for honesty's sake, i'm not interested. no offense.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no! hey! none taken. i don't blame you. i know i'm no brad pitt. that's cool.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{what? you? no, i'm talking about your pal, stainer. i know he's your friend but he seems like kind of a dumbshit. (then) wait. why would you think i was talking about you?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean to assume anything.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{oh my god. you don't have a clue do you? molly's really into you.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, yeah right!}
<A>__{kirk laughs hard until he realizes that patty isn't laughing. patty's nod says, "i'm serious."}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{but... why would...}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{a knockout like molly be interested in a spud like you?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{well, yeah.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{got me. again, no offense. but listen, kirk, your dream girl just showed up. try not to blow it.}
<A>__{close on kirk's terrified expression. the sound of a bowling ball demolishing ten pins...}
<L>__{interior bowling alley night}
<A>__{the place is crowded and classic rock is cranking. it's an old alley with overhead projection score sheets. kirk, stainer and devon sit and talk while jack throws a strike.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{atta boy jackers!}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{it doesn't add up, kirk. if molly's so into you, why bring her friend and give you two tickets?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{she was hoping to set patty up with you.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{oh, great.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it's okay, she wasn't interested.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{so you're saying the hottest babe in the world wants you and the fat chick isn't into me. will you listen to yourself? fuck you.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{what did molly have to say about all this?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i don't know, stainer, somebody got thrown out of the game and i had to drive him home, remember?}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{pretty impressive catch, kirky.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{there's no way. don't get him all worked up. her friend was fuckin' with him. molly said herself that patty loves to mess with people.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{kirk, you deserve a gal like her. and stainer, why don't you try to be a little more supportive.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{why don't you try a little shut the fuck up, devon. this week, we're not taking dating tips from the guy who met his wife in eighth grade.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{are we still bowling?}
<A>__{stainer picks up a crappy, beat up ball from the ball return.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{all i'm saying is she's just too hot. no judgement on kirky, the guy's just outgunned here.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i can't argue with him.}
<A>__{stainer goes to the line. the bowler (a pro type with a custom ball and glove) on the next lane is already standing about to roll. stainer starts to step up.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{yo, house ball! i was up first.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{oh for fucks... what is it with you people?}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{just wait your turn.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{all this noise and bullshit in this place and i'm such a distraction over here in your god damned peripheral vision!?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{okay stains, take it easy.}
<A>__{the bowler stands glaring back.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{well!? fuckin' roll then!}
<A>__{the bowler takes another minute to set. stainer lets out a long sigh. the bowler steps to the line and stainer rushes into his own delivery. both men throw gutters. the bowler comes at stainer but their friends separate them.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{you're lucky motherfucker!}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{oh yeah!? bring it, brunswick!}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{stainer! cool your jets, buster.}
<A>__{the bowler's friends drag him away. stainer takes a deep breath before he shifts right back into conversation mode.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{okay. anyway... i love kirky but let's face it, the guy's a three.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{stainer, that's just dirty pool. he's at least a four.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{you're outta your fuckin' mind four! you go ahead and pump rainbows up his ass. i'm just being honest.}
<A>__{stainer moves the score sheet and then writes a three on the glass. it projects onto the overhead scoreboard.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i can live with three.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{he's a nice guy and he's funny. those are a half a point each.}
<A>__{stainer continues the equation on the projector.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{but he drives a shit box so we gotta deduct a point for that.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{kirk said she likes his taurus.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{that's so fucked, i won't even dignify it with a response. so we're back to three. meanwhile, this molly is a hard ten.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{a hard ten?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{generally, if a broad is that hot you can deduct a few points for dumb or shallow but she went to law school and her sister's blind. that's a hard ten, friends, and that is rare. a seven point disparity that's a chasm. the most you can jump is two points. i can't even get a ten.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, not even you, huh?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{i'm a five, okay?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{bullshit. then what am i?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{you're a seven and a half.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fine, you're a five then.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{okay, so i get a two point bump for being in a band. that puts me at seven. on a good day, most i can bag is a niner.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what about your shitty car?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{artist exemption. i'm expected to have a shitty car.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{is there an artist exemption for being a jag off?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{fuckin' a there is.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{stainer's right. patty was probably just messing around. it's not a big deal. let's just bowl.}
<C>__{devon}
<D>__{what about rick ocasek? billy joel, donald trump...}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{yeah, dumbass. those are the wild cards. money and fame.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so, if he were a millionaire?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{a mil ain't what it once was, jackie. devon's practically a millionaire for christ sake. a mil might get you an eight but to bring down a ten now days two million minimum.}

<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{hey, molly... um, yeah, sure... no, that sounds good. yeah, i know where that is. um, okay, yeah... see you then.}

<C>__{kirk }
