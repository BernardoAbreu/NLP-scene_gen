<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{living room of a very luxurious hotel suite in constantinople.}
<A>__{its style should suggest the locale. ninotchka enters with the three russians, who are very happy to have her with them again.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(indicating the room)}
<D>__{how do you like it, ninotchka? isn't it wonderful?}
<C>__{iranoff and buljanoff}
<D>__{tell us... tell us.}
<A>__{ninotchka protests, but during the whole scene it is evident that behind her protestations there is none of the force and conviction she displayed in a similar situation in the royal suite.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{but buljanoff, iranoff, kopalski...}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{now, please, ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you've done it again and i am responsible. how can you forget yourselves this way? you were sent here to make money, not to spend it.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{buljanoff, she still has those old fashioned bolshevik ideas.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{it is high time you got out of russia.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(not knowing what to}
<D>__{do with the three}
<P>__{rascals)}
<D>__{i must be stern with you.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(delighted)}
<D>__{that's our old ninotchka!}
<C>__{buljanoff and iranoff}
<P>__{(agreeing with him)}
<D>__{yes, yes.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face razinin.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(cockily)}
<D>__{good old razinin! is he still alive? how does he manage?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{but, comrades...}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(with the happiness}
<D>__{of being free again}
<P>__{in his voice)}
<D>__{we are not comrades any more... we are friends, ninotchka.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{we can say whatever we want. we can shout... we can complain... look...}
<P>__{(he opens the door leading to corridor)}
<D>__{the service in this hotel is terrible!}
<P>__{(he closes the door)}
<D>__{see? nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. that's freedom.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{no, that's bad management.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? i must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{don't ask for it, ninotchka. there is a turkish proverb which says, "if something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{and there is a russian saying: "the cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{with our cream situation what it is, it is russia which should apologize to the cats.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(helplessly)}
<D>__{friends... friends, buljanoff, iranoff...}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(afraid of being left out)}
<D>__{...and kopalski.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(pleadingly)}
<D>__{don't make it difficult for me. this is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{that was our idea when we first came. all we thought we would get out of this trip was a turkish bath, but... we learned better.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{ninotchka, we are in the magic east, the country of aladdin and his lamp...}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{...ali baba and the forty thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{all you have to do is say "open sesame."}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i don't know how i can get you out of it this time. how will it end? what will happen to you?}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(intimately)}
<D>__{shall we tell her?}
<C>__{iranoff and kopalski}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{ninotchka, i hope you'll be our guest.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{guest?}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{we have opened a restaurant...}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{...we have a wonderful electric sign: "dine with buljanof, iranoff, and kopalski."}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you mean you are deserting russia?}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(singing the song of freedom)}
<D>__{don't call it desertion. our little restaurant... that is our russia... the russia of borscht, the russia of beef stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{...the russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{we are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(completely bewildered)}
<D>__{who gave you this idea? what is responsible for all this?}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(with a gleam in his eye)}
<D>__{there's something in constantinople... something irresistible....}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(pointing to the balcony)}
<D>__{right now it's on the balcony.}
<A>__{ninotchka looks toward the balcony and is dumbfounded as she sees leon standing there smiling at her. he walks quietly toward her.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(looking longingly at ninotchka)}
<D>__{they wouldn't let me in so i had to get you out.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(still taken aback)}
<D>__{so you're behind all this. i should have known.}
<A>__{leon takes her hand and kisses it. the three russians exchange glances. the camera pans with them leaving ninotchka and leon as russians walk discreetly out of the room and close the door behind them. close shot leon and ninotchka}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{trying to keep me away from you! it couldn't be done. naturally i couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose but i found a way, didn't i? darling, i had to see you. i wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{the one i got they wouldn't let me read.}
<P>__{(carried away by emotion)}
<D>__{it began, "ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "yours, leon."}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(with great feeling and sincerity)}
<D>__{i won't tell you what came between... i will prove it. it will take a long time, ninotchka... at least a lifetime.}
<A>__{ninotchka is aware that she is facing a decision. she knows what she wants but still tries to evade a definite answer.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{but, leon, i am only here for a few days.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{if you don't stay with me, i will have to continue my fight. i will travel wherever russian commissions are. i will turn them all into buljanoffs, iranoffs, and kopalskis. the world will be crowded with russian restaurants. i will depopulate russia. once you saved your country by going back. this time you can save it by staying here.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can i waver? no one shall say ninotchka was a bad russian.}
<A>__{leon takes her in his arms, they kiss as we}
