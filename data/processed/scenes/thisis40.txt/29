<L>__{exterior school parking lot day}
<A>__{as debbie pulls out of the lot, she lights a cigarette.}
<L>__{interior pete's music label day}
<A>__{pete paces around his office on the phone.}
<C>__{accountant }
<D>__{and then you missed the mortgage payment, and that's the second mortgage. you've got to tighten your belt. you've got to go home, sit down, look at your expenses, come clean with debbie.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{oh, god. i can't tell debbie.}
<C>__{accountant }
<D>__{you have to tell her, pete.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{she knows it's bad, but she has no idea just how bad.}
<C>__{accountant }
<D>__{if you sell the house, it'll really buy you some time.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{no. debbie's not really into selling the house.}
<C>__{accountant }
<D>__{as your business manager and your friend, i can't recommend that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hey, how funny would it be if i bought your house?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{okay. bye.}
<C>__{accountant }
<D>__{hang in there.}
<A>__{pete is with ronnie and cat, employees at his record label. they are watching an electronic press kit cut together for graham parker. there is a montage of him performing throughout the years from the seventies to the present.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i'm contextualizing him as one of the great figures in rock history.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you can't show him in his prime in `77 and then jump straight to him as he is now. it's terrifying. you have to reverse it. you've got to show him as he is now very briefly, and then show him in 1977. you have to "benjamin button" it.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about, okay? all rock stars are older now. steven tyler, david bowie, mick jagger }
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{paul mccartney.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{okay, stop it. everybody you're mentioning looks like an old woman now. you're just mentioning a bunch of jessica tandys. keith richards gets away with it. but that's because keith richards looked seventy when he was forty, and now that he's seventy, he looks sixty nine. he's regenerating.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i like it. and i think graham parker is sexy.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{would you fuck him?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you'd fuck him, and you won't fuck me?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i mean, i kind of fucked you once, if you could have finished.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{oh, i finished.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you know what, enough of who fucked who and who finished what.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i finished.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{look. it's a retro label. that's our niche. that's our market. it costs money to break new bands, i can't do that.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{oh, okay. and also you're the guy who turned down arcade fire.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{everyone turned down arcade fire.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{it's crazy, there are so many of them!}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{we don't have the money to market a new band. we just need to make graham seem relevant. who is he talking to?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{um, the jewish journal.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{the jewish journal?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{apparently old jews are the only ones who still buy hard copies of records. because they don't like to download music. because they don't know what downloading means.}
<A>__{angle on graham and a journalist wearing a yarmulke.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{why is this album different from any other album?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it isn't.}
<A>__{angle on pete, cat and ronnie.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what is he wearing?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{it's a hat with the oreo logo on it.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i don't think he's being ironic, i think he just really likes oreos.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{look. the paul westerberg record did okay. frank black did all right. the haircut 100, not so much. we have to break this record. otherwise, we're not here next year.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{he's coming. oreo man is coming.}
<A>__{graham walks up.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{hey guys, how are you?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{aren't cookies the best?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yeah. jewish journal guy loves the record.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{great!}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{got a bit of a problem. touch of gout.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{gout?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yeah, my whole family, they all had gout.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that's very unfortunate.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{my auntie queenie, she had a foot like the size of a small pig. i've got a photo of it.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'd love to see that photo of that gout foot.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{a couple of bunions as well.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{fuck.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i've got to go to the podiatrist, and i hope he can shoot me up with something.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yeah, well, let's get you to the podiatrist.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{bye, graham.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{see you later, graham. good luck with your gout!}
