<L>__{exterior gattaca. night.}
<A>__{while his fellow workers sit on the steps at the service entrance to gattaca, passing around an unlabeled bottle of clear liquor, vincent sits some distance away studying his text book. in the absence of a computer, he practices typing commands on a keyboard handdrawn on the flap of a cardboard box. a tiny, seedy looking man, german, forties, appears from nowhere and takes a seat beside him.}
<C>__{german}
<P>__{(offering his hand)}
<D>__{vincent, i'm german }
<P>__{(anticipating vincent's response)}
<D>__{that's my name.}

<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{german}

<D>__{i think i could do something}
<P>__{(glancing to the text book)}
<D>__{provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.}
<A>__{vincent pulls a plastic e money card from his overalls.}
<C>__{german}
<D>__{you got a photo of yourself?}
<A>__{vincent produces a snapshot of himself torn from the family portrait. german feeds the snapshot into the pocket sized computer he carries. the picture is instantly scanned and appears on the computer's small color screen. german returns the photograph and hastily departs. caesar, the elderly janitor, notices german's exit.}
<C>__{caesar}
<P>__{(to vincent)}
<D>__{i thought i told you not to get any ideas.}
<A>__{high up the side of a building, washing windows, vincent pauses occasionally to practice typing commands on his cardboard keys viewing a screen in his imagination or the nightsky itself. he hears his name being called.}
<C>__{german}
<D>__{vincent...vincent...}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(staring through his glasses)}
<D>__{german, is that you?}
