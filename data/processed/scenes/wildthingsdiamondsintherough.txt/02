<L>__{exterior museum day}
<A>__{marie fires up her powerful bmw, parked right outside the austere museum building. the powerful stereo blasts, sending the birds fluttering skywards... credits appear over... ariel footage of a narrow highway, marie's bmw streaking through the endless tract of florida wetlands. in the water, gators, warm themselves in the early morning sun... moving over the vast tracts of swampland, flocks of tropical birds stretch their majestic wings, locals speed across the stagnant waters in their deafening airboats... through thick trees and foliage to trailer homes and tract housing and into the town of blue bay, where the nip tucked denizens sip three martini lunches and tee off at the local country club. marie steers her bmw into the showroom like parking lot of blue bay high school.}
