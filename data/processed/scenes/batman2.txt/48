<L>__{interior penguin's lair night}
<A>__{the unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with the flutter and song of cold weather birds dozens of them, all chirping, flitting about in the rafters, alighting on special perches mounted in the walls. at the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken pool. arctic terns loll on the surrounding rocks as a lackey with a wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already frigid water. carefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the gotham zoological gardens. a massive, indistinct shape glides beneath the surface. it's not a whale; it's too pink. it is, instead, the penguin and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees frick standing in the open doorway.}

<D>__{mr. boniface? your...visitor has arrived.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{thank you, mr. frick. show her in.}
<A>__{the penguin moves to the edge of the sunken pool. two of his lackeys swivel a crossbar, which hangs from the ceiling by a long chain, into place over his head. he grasps it with both hands and the crossbar rises, hoisting his formidable bulk out of the water.}
