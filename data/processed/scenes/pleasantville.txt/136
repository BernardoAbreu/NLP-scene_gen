<L>__{interior bowling alley. night.}
<A>__{the regular occupants of the barber shop spread out across three lanes. each wears a pleasantville bowling shirt, sponsored by one of big bob's businesses. the noise from the crashing pins is deafening and there aren't any windows so the storm has gone unnoticed ...}
<B>__{angle. big bob.}
<A>__{he picks up a 7 10 split and claps his hands in delight. he starts to cross back to the scorer's table when he looks up and suddenly stops.}
<B>__{reverse angle. his pov.}
<A>__{george is standing in the doorway to the bowling alley cold and shivering. his shirt is soaked through to the skin. his hair is drenched and dripping.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{he doesn't answer. george clutches his body and keeps shivering.}
<B>__{wider.}
<A>__{the men stop bowling and rush to george's side. he blinks a couple of times, still soaked to the bone.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<P>__{(looking at him)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(faintly)}
<D>__{rain.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{real rain?}
<A>__{george nods. bob rushes to the glass door of the bowling alley and sees the driving storm. a huge fork of lightning lights up the sky.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{oh my god ...}
<A>__{he turns back to george.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{... we had no idea. burt was rolling a 250 and ...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<A>__{george shivers and bobs leads him over to one of the benches and guides him into the seat ...}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(still shivering)}
<D>__{well, i ... i came home like i always do, and i came in the front door. and i took off my coat. and i put down my briefcase and i said "honey. i'm home."}
<B>__{angle. men.}
<A>__{they all nod in recognition.}
<B>__{angle. george.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{... only no one was there.}
<A>__{a murmur goes through the men.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{so i went into the kitchen and i yelled it again. "honey i'm home." but there was no one there either. no wife. no lights. no dinner.}
<A>__{they all gasp.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{so i went to the oven you know because i thought maybe she had made me one of those "tv dinners ..."}
<A>__{the men nod and lean forward. george shakes his head.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{but she hadn't. she was gone.}
<A>__{a louder murmur moves through the crowd. george lowers his head and just shakes it from side to side. big bob moves up and puts a hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(gently the patriarch)}
<D>__{... it's gonna be fine george.}
<A>__{george looks up at him helplessly. bob pats him reassuringly on the back.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{what do we do bob?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{well we'll be safe for now thank goodness we're in a bowling alley but if george here doesn't get his dinner, any one of us could be nexterior it could be you gus, or you burt, or even you phil ...}
<A>__{they murmur again. bob gathers a little steam.}
<C>__{bob }
<P>__{(like a wwii movie)}
<D>__{... that's real rain out there gentlemen. this isn't some little "virus" that's going to "clear up on it's own." there's something happening to our town and i think we can all see where it comes from.}
<A>__{they nod in agreement.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{we're gonna need a town meeting. phil, how fast can you turn around a leaflet in your print shop?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{couple of hours.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{gus, why don't you get a bunch of kids from the basketball team to help you put them up on lamposts and tree trunks ...}
<A>__{gus nods. big bob turns to george and smiles. it's a warm, patriarchal smile. he claps a hand on george's shoulder.}
<C>__{bob }
<P>__{(soothingly)}
<D>__{and the first thing you're gonna do is get a cup of hot cocoa and a nice dry bowling shirt.}
