<C>__{bloom }
<D>__{get invited in for coffee, and tell them the full tale.}
<A>__{bloom looks about to launch into something, when penelope drops a stack of cash bound in a green rubber band on his dashboard.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{for the bike, and the whole, thing. this was a big shit sandwich. ok. bye.}
<A>__{the car door slams and she's gone. bloom sits a moment.}
<C>__{bloom }
<D>__{however, there are advantages to playing it cool. letting it lie for a day or two, then casually re establish contact.}
<A>__{bloom starts driving off, and adjusts the passenger side mirror so it points back to the road. as he does he sees penelope in it, sprinting after his car. he stops. a moment later she appears at his window, heaving.}
