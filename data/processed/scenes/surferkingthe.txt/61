<L>__{exterior later that day thunder bay}
<A>__{we see three male participants standing in the shallow end of thunder bay, one red suit (lifeguard) one blue suit (concessions) and one green suit (grounds) a judge on the rise to the west of thunder bay blows an air horn to start the race. they all rush into the bay and begin swimming furiously. the guard takes the lead quickly, followed not far behind by the grounds kid. the concessions kid is working hard and splashing a lot but not getting very far. as the guard reaches the back wall, he does an underwater racing turn and swims back toward the point where they started. right behind him, the smaller grounds kid does the same thing. as they are returning, they pass the concessions kid, who still is splashing a lot but not going fast. after they pass him he stops, as he is tired out. momentarily he can't even tread water any more, and a guard watching from the sidelines jumps in and pulls him out. the swimming guard has beaten the grounds kid, the concessions kid never finishes.}
