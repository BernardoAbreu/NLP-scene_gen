<C>__{mater }
<D>__{idiot? is that how you see me?}
<C>__{finn }
<D>__{that's how everyone sees you. i tell you, that's the genius of it.}
<A>__{fade in on mater, back at the casino, eyeing his reflection in the glass window. it's the same moment from before except now we are watching it from a detached, floating perspective.}
<C>__{finn }
<D>__{no one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool.}
<A>__{ in the kabuki theater in japan again, from before. mater makes a spectacle of himself, whooping and hollering in the stands with the face paint on.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{domo arigato!}
<A>__{mcqueen, fillmore, guido, luigi, sarge and patrons eye mater, embarrassed and angry. in the japanese museum the moment of mater banging on the zen rock garden's glass. except that now we see all sorts of disappointed and eyebrow raising reactions.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{you done good! you got all the leaves!}
<C>__{jeff gorvette}
<D>__{check out that tow truck.}
<C>__{lewis hamilton}
<D>__{i wonder who that guy's with?}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<P>__{(humiliated)}
<D>__{will you guys excuse me just for one little second?}
<A>__{we now reveal that this floating, third person perspective is mater. he's inside his past, watching it from others' points of view. he doesn't like what he sees. on mater, now at the sushi bar.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{now that's a scoop of ice cream!}
<A>__{mater swallows the wasabi with one big bite. he screams! the sushi bar patrons blanch with revulsion at his wail. on the fountain, as mater peels into full view of everyone else at the party. as mater laps up water from a fountain:}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{mater?!}
<A>__{all the racers, with francesco front and center, guffaw at mater. on mcqueen, now scolding mater moments later.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{i never leak oil. never.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{mater, you have to get a hold of yourself. you're making a scene!}
<A>__{ in mcqueen's pit garage, after the japanese race.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{wait a minute. i didn't screw you up, did i?}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{i lost the race because of you!}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{maybe if i talked to somebody, or }
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{i don't need your help. i don't want your help!}
<A>__{ now back at the party, a moment we didn't see before but which presumably happened. mater is banging a ceremonial gong, to the horror of japanese guests.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{bang a gong, get it on!}
<A>__{gonnnnnng!!! on the partygoers, race cars, party staff they're all laughing at mater as mcqueen's final words blend in, making a dissatisfied cacophony}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{listen, this isn't radiator springs. this is exactly why i don't bring you along to these things!}
<A>__{off the gong at the party }
