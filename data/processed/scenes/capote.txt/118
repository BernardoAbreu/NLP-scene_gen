<A>__{wood paneled walls, government issue desk. on the wall behind the desk is a chart a racial accounting of the current inmate population. it reads: white 1405, colored 360, mexicans 12, indians 6. warden marshall krutch is fat, coarse, sweaty even in winter. and it's spring. he's running for congress there are "krutch for congress" bumper stickers laying around the office. he's enjoying a chance at a little publicity. the young prison guard stands quietly by the wall.}
