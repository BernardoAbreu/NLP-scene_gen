<L>__{interior morgue night}
<A>__{the mortician turns off the lights in the main hall and steps into his office, sits down, pours himself a hot drink; turns on the radio, opens his conic book. a noise o.s. disturbs him and he gets up, walks out of his office, looks into the darkness. his p.o.v. pans around the empty morgue. nothing. decides to go back to his office. he turns and is startled by three mystery men obstructing his path.}
<C>__{man 1}
<D>__{we are looking for the white victims.}
<C>__{mortician}
<D>__{and who the hell are you ?}
<A>__{the mortician catches a glimpse of the shiny dagger man 1 is clutching by his side. he becomes very scared.}
<C>__{mortician}
<D>__{over there. numbers eight to twelve.}
<A>__{three men look over to where the mortician has pointed in unison. man 1 looks back.}
<C>__{man 1}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{a flash of steel. the mortician's throat spouts blood. he grabs reflexively at the gash and falls back onto the floor, dead before he hits the tiles. the mystery men step to an adjoining chamber. man 2 puts down a box he is carrying, opens the lid. a green glow oozes out. the other men manipulate levers on a control panel on a nearby wall. stainless steel doors open. body length trays slide into the dim light. shapes covered in white sheets. man 2 with the box removes a glass syringe, filled with a glowing green liquid. he steps to the bodies and injects each with the syringe, through the sheets. when he has finished he steps back, places the syringe back in the box. the men leave silently. all is silent and still. then the shape beneath a sheet starts to sit up. then another, and another.}
