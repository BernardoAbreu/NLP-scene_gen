<L>__{interior rehearsal room day}
<A>__{pamela sits at a large meeting table as dolly bustles around her placing refreshments. pamela lays out her pencils one by one, makes sure her notebook is `just so.' a bowl of fruit is set down upon her notebook and she snatches it away, glaring at the table which is now laden with every type of snack and beverage imaginable from bagels to candy, coffee to soda, there are exotic fruits, enormous bouquets of flowers.}
<C>__{pamela}
<P>__{(peering around a vase at dagradi)}

<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{we could save a starving country with benefaction from this room alone! ugh, it's so vulgar.}
<A>__{she gets up and moves the giant bouquet of flowers off the table and plops it on top of dick's piano. bob moves it from the piano to the floor.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(seething)}
<D>__{that is a very expensive piano.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{and these are beautiful blooms butchered for our visual and nasal enjoyment when we could have just as easily gone to the window, looked out and gazed upon them happily minding their own business and very much still alive.}
<A>__{bob hasn't a clue what to say. pamela smoothes down her skirt and re takes her seat. everybody waits. pamela flicks her eyes at the tape recorder which don duly turns on.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{let us begin.}
<A>__{she perches her glasses on her nose and raises an eyebrow at the cover of her script "walt disney's mary poppins."}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{hm.}
<A>__{a rustling of papers and one or two uneasy glances as the men, too, open their scripts.}

<A>__{dolly gingerly places the tray on the table and hovers, distributing fruit and biscuits within reachable distance.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{unbelievable.}
<A>__{pamela shakes her head but decides to ignore dolly and carry on.}

<D>__{ extemporized and thought up before your very eyes! alright, here we go }
<A>__{dick begins to play and sing, he pounds the keys with gusto, smiling away, acting it out with all his heart and soul, almost unable to contain himself with glee. bob occasionally joins in for a word or two but is much more serious, eyeing travers for her every reaction.}
