<C>__{miller}
<D>__{okay, wade, your turn.}
<A>__{wade captain, i love it when you say that. miller, sarge, reiben and jackson cover wade as he races to the first of three bunkers. dodging bullets from inside. wade tosses a satchel charge into a gun port. a huge, muffled explosion, rocks the bunker.}

<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{yeah? so?}
<A>__{the german fire diminishes for an instant. miller, sarge and reiben immediately rise and pour fire at the german positions. german machine gun fire responds and they duck down again.}

<A>__{miller hesitates, then:}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.}

<D>__{alright, i will give you that. continue.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{the numbers don't make sense, sir. his brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away. one private is simply not worth a squad. colonel anderson this one is. he's worth a lot more than that. which is why i'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.}
<A>__{miller shrugs.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yes and no, sir, what about morgan? fine officer, regular church goer, writes poetry, he might like a mission like this.}

<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{captain, my feet are most uncomfortable. if i'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to ramelle, i never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you didn't volunteer, jackson.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{i most likely would have, sir, had i been given the opportunity.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{if we find ryan and he's still alive, that son of a bitch is gonna carry this goddamned b.a.r. back to the beach for me.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft. back home, we go out squirrel huntin', i walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{you know what a b.a.r. weighs? nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.}
<P>__{(re. ammo bandoleers)}
<D>__{and you think these things are comfortable? they may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty six pounds, right there.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{so what? i've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen and a half pineapples, and all my regular gear. you don't hear me complaining.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{that's because, as i have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{no, i just happen to take the captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{how do you do it?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{it's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{oh, christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{as i was saying, before i was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. he needed someone to take care of him. we move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home. nice enough place but kind of depressing. but not for granddad. he just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service. it just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{you think he really believed it?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{who knows? it worked.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned private james ryan can carry my fucking gear.}

<D>__{you want unpleasant? just wait, i can do much better than this.}

<C>__{miller}
<D>__{we had a jeep until a few hours ago, a nice one, it had a cute little flag with a couple of stars on it.}

<C>__{miller}

<C>__{miller}
<D>__{jackson.}
<A>__{jackson steps up. miller points to the steeple. jackson knows what he's supposed to do. he puts down his m 1 and takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to his back. he spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very unusual, long barrel, rifle. miller and his men give him some room. hamill and his men, along with upham, watch curiously. jackson opens a two foot tripod with a flick of his wrist, sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it. then he takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it. he adjusts the eye piece and clicks in the bolt action. upham is fascinated.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over sized shell.}
<C>__{jackson}

<D>__{that must be four thousand yards.}

<P>__{(without taking his eye from the scope)}
<D>__{forty two hundred, i figure.}

<D>__{you take account of the wind?}

<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{they got squirrels there, too, right?}
<A>__{jackson fires. waits. a tiny smile. he starts taking apart the rifle. a very impressed captain hamill barks to his radioman. captain hamill get a hold of command, tell them the st. mere road is open. the radioman cranks up his radio. captain hamill turns to miller. captain hamill how far back is the rest of division?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{very far, they're not coming this way, they're going to take caen first.}
<A>__{captain hamill goddamn it, i was afraid of that. we're in a lot of trouble up here, and it's gonna get worse before it gets better. how many men did you bring?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{five, but we not staying, we're on our way to ramelle.}
<A>__{captain hamill shit, are you the guys going up to find private ryan?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yeah, you know about that?}
<A>__{captain hamill command radioed, wanted to know if he came in with the early wounded or dead. several of captain hamill's men, among them a gentle faced private, prick up their ears at the mention of private ryan. captain hamill we're supposed to tell you, they intercepted a german transmission after you left. the krauts have two companies on their way to ramelle to take back that bridge, they'll be there sometime late tomorrow.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{wonderful.}
<A>__{captain hamill if ryan's alive, you'd better get him the hell out of there before those krauts show up.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{how do we get out of here?}
<A>__{captain hamill you don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in real tight. after dark you try to slip out to the east. if you tip toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens, you've got a fair chance of making it up to ramelle by tomorrow night. miller processes the information. captain hamill shakes his head. captain hamill tough, huh? three brothers? miller shrugs. captain hamill we sure as hell could use your help here, but i understand what you're doing?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{captain hamill good luck.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{captain hamill i mean it. find him. get him home. miller is a bit taken aback by captain hamill's forceful sincerity. then he shakes it off and motions to his men.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{let's find someplace to hole up.}
<A>__{miller nods to captain hamill, then, as he moves to the head of the alley, miller passes upham.}

<D>__{don't bunch up.}

<C>__{upham}
<D>__{did you see what he did, back there? he stepped right into the open, so i could get across.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{shit, that was no big deal.}

<D>__{they can't kill him.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{like hell they can't.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, i can't explain it, but i've seen it.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{we all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.}

<L>__{exterior st. mere cathedral dusk}

<C>__{miller}
<D>__{sure, what do you want to know?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one? what's the sense in risking six guys to save one?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{ours is not to reason why.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.}

<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{easy for you to say, sir.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{fucking james ryan, i'd like to wring his fucking neck.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{jesus, reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.}

<D>__{well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us have mothers.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you have orders, too.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{sir, i have an opinion on this matter.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i'd love to hear it.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{seems to me, cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources. miller go on.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{well, sir, by my way a thinkin' i am a finely made instrument of warfare. what i mean by that is, if you was to put me with this here sniper rifle anywhere up to and includin' one mile from adolf hitler, with a clear line of sight, war's over.}
<A>__{miller nods.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{reiben, i want you to listen closely to jackson. this is the way to gripe. jackson, continue.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{yes, sir. it seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the united states army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack dab in the middle of berlin, germany. now i ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my god given talent.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{wade?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{hell, i don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at ramelle for...}

<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{and what about you, captain?}
<A>__{miller looks at reiben, shocked.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{reiben, what's the matter with you? i don't gripe to you. i'm a captain. there's a chain of command. griping goes one way, up, only up, never down. you gripe to me, i gripe to my superior officers. up, get it? i don't gripe to you, i don't gripe in front of you. how long you been in the army?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir, i apologize.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but if you weren't a captain, or if i were a major, what would you say?}
<A>__{miller considers his response.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{in that case, i would say this is an excellent mission, with an extremely valuable objective, worthy of my best efforts.}
<A>__{reiben rolls his eyes. miller plays it straight, with no obvious sarcasm.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{in addition, as i pointed out earlier, i have a fondness for cheese and i hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. moreover, i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan and i'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, reiben, to help relieve her suffering. the men thoroughly enjoy the performance.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{sir, if you were not a captain, i would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{but i am a captain. if i were not a captain, i would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top notch poker player, which i am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...}

<C>__{miller}
<D>__{any further thoughts on the subject?}

<D>__{yes, sir, as a final note, i'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of france and while we're at it, fuck private james ryan.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i will make a note of your suggestions but i will leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.}

<D>__{we move out in two hours, try and get some sleep.}
<A>__{the men know when to can it. without another word, they all settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to follow miller's order. upham looks around at these strange men, then, a simple, hard glare from miller makes him follow suit. miller looks at his men, then pulls out his map case and his flashlight. he turns it on, in the dim glow of the light, he studies his maps while his men rest.}
<L>__{exterior st. mere cathedral night (later)}
<A>__{dark. artillery rumbles in the distance. reiben, jackson, wade and upham sleep. miller still sits in the glow of his flashlight, studying his maps. sarge lies near him, awake, watching him. sarge notices some unopened envelopes in miller's map case and speaks quietly to him.}

<D>__{let's move out.}
<A>__{miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness, lit intermittently by the distant flashes. captain hamill and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a strange bit of hope.}
<L>__{exterior french country side night}
<A>__{the final rumbles of the distant artillery fade away. the night is dark. the band of six americans makes their way warily along a french cart path. sarge eases up alongside miller and speaks quietly to him. the others don't overhear. sarge how long's your hand been shaking?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{a couple of weeks. it started in portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{is it getting worse?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{no. it comes and goes. it stops when i look at it.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{you may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.}

<D>__{i will be alright.}

<A>__{farther along. the men are tired but alert. jackson is at pointerior miller behind him. the others at intervals. sarge brings up the rear. a sound. jackson stops. no one speaks, they communicate only with hand signals. jackson signals to miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming. miller signals for the men to get off the path. they ease into the brush. an instant later, a pair wary german infantry men appear. reiben grips his b.a.r. and looks to miller for permission to open up. miller shakes his head and signals, "let them go." a moment later an entire platoon of germans rounds the bend. fifty men. heavily armed. reiben breathes a sigh of relief and lowers hi b.a.r. the german platoon passes, their boots no more than two feet from the faces of the hidden americans. upham is wide eyed with fear. the others are stone faced.}
<B>__{the germans pass.}
<A>__{miller motions for his men to hold their positions. upham doesn't see the signal. he stands, breathing a sigh of relief, just as a german whip tail squad appears, trailing the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear. upham freezes. he's standing, barely in the shadows, nearly exposed. shitting bricks. pissed, miller prepares to fire. the whip tail squad approaches. then, the germans pass, miraculously, not seeing upham in the shadows. they walk on and disappear. upham is weak kneed, amazed that he's still alive. miller shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the rest of the men to follow him into the woods. upham scurries after miller, staying close on his heels.}
<L>__{exterior field night}
<A>__{the little band of americans walks along the edge of a field, parallel to a cart path. wary. miller notices jackson and wade drifting too close to each other. he snaps his fingers, getting their attention, and motions curtly for them to open it up a bit. they do so.}

<D>__{it'll be light, soon. let's pick it up.}

<C>__{miller}
<D>__{no problem. a pair of deuces? less? so what? i bluff. it used to tear me apart when i'd get one of my men killed, but what was i supposed to do? break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do? of course not, so i bluffed, and after a while, i started to fall for my own bluff. it was great, it made everything so much easier. sarge is that why your hand's been shaking?}

<D>__{oh, yeah?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn. so if you're scared or empty or half a step from a section eight, do you tell your men? of course not. you bluff, you lie.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{and how do you bluff yourself?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{simple, numbers. every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. we lost, what, thirty one on the cliffs? i will bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns. that's over three hundred men. maybe five hundred. a thousand. then thousand. any number you want. see? it's simple. it lets you always choose mission over men.}
<C>__{sarge}

<D>__{yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.}
<A>__{miller laughs. miller i will bite, reiben.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{i've given this a lot of thought, sir. the best thing that could happen is, we find ryan and he's dead.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{well, sir, consider the possibilities. a: ryan is alive. we have to take him back to the beach. knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{except for the last part, that one's not bad.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{b: ryan is dead. he's been blown up by the german equivalent of wade, whose name i know you don't want me to mention. there's nothing to find. the biggest piece is the size of a pea. we wander around, looking for him until the germans pick us off, one after another.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i don't like that one.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{neither do i, sir. c: and this is the worst one, we find ryan and he's wounded. not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. and him.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{but we accomplish the mission.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{maybe. but what if he dies on the way back? you see what i'm saying, sir? the best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog tags and high tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to caen and catch up with division.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{that's a mystery to me.}
<A>__{no one smiles, but they trudge a bit less.}
<L>__{exterior crossroads day}
<A>__{the sound of heavy firing. miller checks a map in the brush near the crossroads. a sign reads: "ramelle 3 km." miller folds up the map.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{looks like we're going to beat those kraut companies to ramelle.}
<A>__{suddenly miller stops dead. he listens, hearing something the others don't hear. he motions for them to freeze, they do. the sound grows louder. it's an ominous rumble.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<L>__{exterior french road day}
<A>__{the rumble turns into the roar of a big german convoy. troop trucks, armored personnel carriers, a regiment of crack wehrmacht troops. heavily armed. imposing. crossing a bridge.}
<B>__{camera pans down to reveal}
<A>__{miller and his men crowded into a culvert under the bridge. brush and debris partially shield the ends of the culvert.}
<C>__{german flank squads}
<D>__{hurry along the fields on either side of the road, trying to keep up with the vehicles. miller and his men catch a glimpse of an approaching german flank squad. they flatten themselves into the mucky water. ready their weapons. prepare to fire.}

<D>__{approaches the bridge.}
<B>__{pair of german privates}
<A>__{see the culvert obscured by brush. move to check it out.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{is just about to open up on them.}
<C>__{the german sergeant}
<D>__{sees his flank squad lagging behind and calls to them.}
<C>__{the german privates}
<D>__{obey. hurry after the rest of the convoy.}
<C>__{in the culvert}
<D>__{the americans breathe again.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{i wonder where they're going.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{same place we are.}
<A>__{jackson, at the mouth of the culvert, motions that the coast is clear. they head out.}
<L>__{exterior outskirts of ramelle day}
<A>__{a gently sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small, cultivated fields, bordered by ancient, moss covered stone walls. the twos is visible beyond. miller and his men crouch run to the cover of one of the stone walls. miller pulls out his binoculars.}
<B>__{on the far side of the field}
<A>__{there's a large gathering of german troops and vehicles.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{scans the germans with his binoculars.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{looks like tea time, maybe they're brits.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{i sure hope so.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{what do you think they're waiting for, captain?}
<A>__{just then they hear an ominous rumble, deeper and more threatening that that of the convoy. the sound gets louder and louder. miller and his men exchange looks. they know that sound, they don't like it.}
<B>__{four massive german tanks}
<A>__{appear down the road, heading for the german soldiers who greet them enthusiastically. the tanks are tigers, huge, far bigger than an american sherman. each one, sixty two tons, with a big 88 mm gun, four heavy machine guns and impregnable armor. each one, an infantryman's nightmare. there are four of them.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{puts away the binoculars and jerks his head for his men to follow, low, along the wall. the men are happy to do so, looking back nervously at the german tanks.}
<L>__{exterior town square ramelle day}
<A>__{the sounds of sporadic small arms fire. the town square is a deserted battlefield, littered with burning debris, shell casings and bodies, german and american and a few french civilians. miller and his men enter the square, weapons ready, leap frogging from doorway to doorway. miller and sarge crouch run to the cover of some overhanging debris. they listen, trying to pinpoint the exact source of the firing. sarge motions his guess. miller nods in agreement. he signals for the men to follow him around, not toward, the firing. they move on, dashing from cover to cover.}
<L>__{exterior bridge ramelle day}
<A>__{a dozen american paratroopers on the bridge exchange sporadic fire with a few german snipers hidden in the buildings near the bridgehead. the bridge has clearly been the scene of heavy fighting. craters, burning debris and shell casings are everywhere. the bridge is intact, only slightly damaged. there are dozens of german bodies along the riverbank on both sides of the bridge.}
<B>__{miller and his men}
<A>__{crouch run and take cover as they get within sight of the bridge.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, captain.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{on the bridge! we're coming in.}
<A>__{a young but grizzled voice calls back.}
<C>__{voice from bridge}
<D>__{kiss my ass, fritz.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you fire at us and i will do a hell of a lot more than that.}
<C>__{voice from bridge}
<D>__{who won the '38 army navy game?}
<A>__{miller turns to his men. they all come up empty.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i have no fucking idea. here we come.}
<P>__{(to his men)}
<D>__{cover me.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{what if our guys open up, sir?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you're only allowed to shoot at germans, that's one of the rules.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{have it your way, captain.}
<A>__{miller takes a breath, then dashes out into the open, toward the bridge.}
<B>__{the german snipers open up}
<A>__{bullets smash into the ground around miller.}
<C>__{miller's men}
<D>__{pour fire at the german positions, surpressing the german fire.}
<C>__{on the bridge}
<D>__{the paratroopers pour a heavy stream of bullets at the german positions.}
<A>__{miller makes it to the bridge and dives over a defensive jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies. he finds himself next to sergeant bill forrest who was the young but grizzled voice that called out. with forrest are some very worn out, young american paratroopers. miller catches his breath. forrest navy, sir, twenty one to nineteen. they won on a field goal in overtime.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i will keep it in mind.}
<P>__{(calls to sarge)}
<D>__{okay, sarge, one at a time.}
<A>__{miller and the paratroopers fire cover for miller's men as they come in. miller and forrest alternately take and fire. forrest are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to hold this bridge for twenty four hours, it's been six days.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{things are tough all over. we're looking for a private james ryan.}
<A>__{forrest ryan?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{is he here?}
<A>__{forrest motions to one of the paratroopers. forrest go get ryan.}
<P>__{(to miller)}
<D>__{what do you want him for, sir?}
<A>__{miller doesn't answer. jackson leaps over the barricade and scrambles to them.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{jackson, get a hold of command.}
<A>__{jackson cranks up the five thirty five. miller turns to forrest.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{how many men do you have?}
<A>__{they pause to fire, covering sarge, the last of miller's men to leap over the barricade. forrest eleven, sir. we started with thirty six. the bridge was easy to take but the krauts have been coming back at us ever since. they must want it intact or we'd be long gone. jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating miller's hailing i.d. no response.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{not yet.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{keep trying.}
<A>__{forrest sir, what do you want with ryan? miller doesn't answer, he looks past forrest and sees:}
<C>__{private james ryan}
<D>__{dashing from cover to cover, making his way toward them. ryan is an american classic, nineteen years old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky. though he's exhausted, unshaven, and smeared with dirt and blood, he's very alive. his eyes shine, his face has a spark. you can't help but love this kid.}
<C>__{miller's men}
<D>__{all watch ryan run toward them.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{so, that's ryan.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{looks like a flaming asshole to me.}
<A>__{their eyes remain glued to ryan as he makes it to the barricade. he salutes miller.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{i'm ryan, sir. you wanted to see me?}
<A>__{miller looks at ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally face to face with him. ryan waits. miller hesitates, searching for words. then he speaks gently but clearly. miller private, i've got some bad news for you. your brothers have been killed in action. the life instantly drains from ryan. his breath comes hard. somehow he remains upright. ryan all three?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{ryan sways. miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning him against some sandbags.}
<C>__{the paratroopers}
<D>__{are stunned at the news. they look at ryan, there's nothing else they can do.}
<C>__{miller's men}
<D>__{also look at ryan, but then, one after another, they turn away, adverting their eyes, looking a their own boots, the debris on the bridge, the sky, anything other than ryan.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{we've been sent to get you out of here. you're going home.}
<A>__{ryan weakly waves miller off. miller motions to his men and the paratroopers to move away. they do so, giving ryan a little room. forrest three brothers, the poor son of a bitch.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{sergeant, we're moving out and i'm taking you and your men with me.}
<A>__{forrest but, sir, our orders are clear, we're to hold this bridge until we're relieved by forward elements of the twenty ninth division.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i'm giving you new orders, sergeant.}
<A>__{forrest sir, you can't do that, these orders are from command.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i'm not going to leave you and your men here to get killed. get them together, we're moving out.}
<A>__{a voice from behind them speaks simply, clearly, firmly.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{no, sir.}
<A>__{they all turn and see ryan standing there. miller is about to automatically rip ryan a new asshole for contradicting him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches ryan on the arm and speaks softly to him.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{come on, private, you're going home.}
<A>__{ryan jerks away from miller.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<A>__{all eyes are on miller and ryan. miller remains patient.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{private. i'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{sir, if the krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{this bridge cannot be held. the germans have two companies less than three miles from here. they have tanks.}
<A>__{that news clearly affects ryan and the other paratroopers, but ryan holds his ground. ryan sir, i'm still not going. miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{private, if you want to commit suicide, that's your choice, but you're going to have to wait until after i get you back to the beach. and you're not going to take these men with you.}
<A>__{ryan stands eye to eye with miller.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i'm not leaving, sir.}
<A>__{miller starts to boil over.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{the hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if i have to drag you every inch of the way. you hear me, private?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i hear you sir, but i'm not leaving.}

<C>__{miller}
<D>__{listen you little son of a bitch you're coming with me or i will...i will...}
<A>__{ryan speaks softly.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{what are you going to do, sir, shoot me?}
<A>__{miller considers it. then reiben speaks up from behind miller.}
<C>__{reiben}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{uh, excuse me, captain.}
<A>__{miller slowly turns and glares.}
<C>__{reiben}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{so, what are a few tanks, sir?}
<A>__{miller's more amazed than pissed off. reiben smiles.}
<C>__{reiben}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble. and he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.}
<B>__{jackson steps forward.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{cap'n...?}
<A>__{miller turns his glare on jackson.}
<C>__{jackson}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{seems to me, we got us a opportunity, here, to kill two birds with one stone. command seems to think keepin' this boy alive is worth somethin'. if we was to do that and hold this bridge, good chance we'd get us a bucket full of medals. i might even get me one 'a them big, fancy ones like you got, so's i could sass any officer in the whole dang army, you included.}

<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{i do and personally, i'd rather get the hell out of here, but somebody's got to stay and take care of you and these pin head privates of yours.}
<A>__{miller looks at forrest and the paratroopers. forrest we weren't planning on going anywhere, sir. reiben smiles.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{see, captain? the vote's unanimous.}
<A>__{miller's eyes almost pop out of his head. miller the vote? what the hell are you talking about? we don't vote. this isn't a democracy. this is the army, i give orders, you follow them. we don't vote!}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{yes, sir, of course, sir, i was merely speaking hypothetically. if this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous. but of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you're goddamned right, i give the order. vote! jesus christ! listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, i am the ranking officer here and what i say goes, is that clear?}

<C>__{miller}
<D>__{in that case...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i vote we stay.}
<A>__{that's what they wanted to hear. miller doesn't give them time to enjoy it, he immediately starts barking orders.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{reiben, the b.a.r., there. jackson, get up on the bridgekeepers hut with your sniper rifle. sarge, you and upham move that machine gun so it can cover the left flank, it's worthless where it is. forrest, i want a full inventory of all your weapons, ammo and ordnance. go.}
<A>__{they all hurry off, except for ryan who locks eyes with miller for a moment.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(gruffly gentle)}

<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{yes, sir.}

<D>__{alright, come with me.}

<L>__{exterior bridge day}
<A>__{miller and reiben watch as forrest, ryan and a couple other paratroopers lay out their weapons and ammo inventory. forrest two machine guns, twenty two grenades, two gammon grenades, six satchel charges, twenty six m 1's, eight tommy guns and about sixty rounds per man.}

<A>__{reiben, jackson and upham, stone faced, watch ryan. miller eyes the buildings near the bridge head. he speaks to sarge who holds several satchel charges.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{just then they hear the sound of a big gun firing in the distance. they all turn at the sound.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{eighty eights, right?}
<A>__{miller nods.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{i can tell what the gunners had for dinner.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{those guns are close.}
<A>__{forrest just south of town. the krauts have a two gun emplacement, we saw it on the way in. that's how we knew they wanted the bridge intact, they didn't blow the crap out of us.}

<D>__{well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.}

<D>__{what are we going to do?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{we're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.}
