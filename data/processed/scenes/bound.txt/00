<A>__{inside a closet. it is a large closet with double doors, a crisp line of light cutting down through the center of the darkness. as we begin to descend, voices echo in our head.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{i had this image of you, inside of me, like a part of me.}
<A>__{we move past a shelf filled with hatboxes and handbags. it is a woman's closet.}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{you planned this whole thing, didn't you?}
<C>__{caesar }
<D>__{where's the fucking money?}
<A>__{we glide over the tightly packed hangers, close enough to feel the different fabrics and descend past the dresses to the racks of high heels.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{we make our own choices, we pay our own prices.}
<C>__{caesar }

<A>__{we slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel and reach the bottom of the closet, where we find a pair of black dr. martens boots that are tied together with a white rope.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{i want out.}
<A>__{we move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is bound, lying motionless on the floor of the closet, the rope coiling tightly around her wrists. the crack at the bottom of the door lights her face. she is gagged and unconscious, a trickle of blood running down her forehead. her name is corky.}
