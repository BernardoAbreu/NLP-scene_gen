<L>__{interior mr. brooks' office n day}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(coming in)}
<D>__{what are you doing here, gorgeous?}
<A>__{the 19 year old girl we saw arrive by cab stands up and throws her arms around mr. brooks.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i'm sorry, daddy, please don't be angry with me.}
<A>__{mr. brooks kisses jane on the forehead and goes to sit at his desk.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i can guess what you've done, but why don't you tell me and then i will decide.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i dropped out of school.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{okay. have you told your mother this?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no. i wanted to speak to you first.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{you'll have to tell her, i'm not going to do that for you, and then together the three of us will decide where to go from here.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i've thought a lot about this, dad. college is a waste of time for me.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i don't know how you know that half way through your freshman year, but...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you didn't go to college, dad, and you're successful. i want to come and work for you.}
<A>__{sitting on the couch:}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{she's not telling you everything, she's hiding something.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(to jane)}
<D>__{i'm not hiring right now.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{just listen to me. what would happen to the business if, god forbid, something happened to you? mom would probably have to sell to strangers. i'm willing to start at the bottom, you can treat me as a regular employee, i want to learn everything there is to know about running the box business, and then when the time comes, the business would stay in the family.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{that's sweet, but you're talking about emotion, not business. in fact your mother and i came very close to selling out last year.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{if we had been offered a little more money, and they may come back to us, we will sell.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what would you do without...?!}
<A>__{there's a knock on the door.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{sunday, the secretary, comes in and crossing to mr. brooks:}
<C>__{sunday}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i know you didn't want to be disturbed, the man in the waiting room insisted i give you this.}
<A>__{she hands mr. brooks a letter size envelope.}
<C>__{sunday}
<D>__{he said you would find what's inside very interesting.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{what is he? a salesman?}
<C>__{sunday}
<D>__{he won't say. i've never seen him before. i can tell him to go away if you want me to.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{that's okay.}
<A>__{she leaves. slicing the flap of the envelope, mr. brooks picks up with jane.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{part of spending the four years in college is to...}
<A>__{mr. brooks can now see the contents of the envelope. two snapshot size photos taken with a high speed digital camera. one shows the right side of mr. brooks's cheek. he is in no way identifiable, but that blur of flesh appears to be looking at the dead dance couple. the second photo is a clear shot of mr. brooks closing the curtains with the dead dance couple behind him. neither mr. brooks's voice or his face betray the enormity of what he's looking at.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{... eh... to give yourself the chance to find out who you are and what you want to do.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i will talk to mom, but i'm not going back to school.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{where would you live?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{to save money i would move back home, but no rules, no curfew, i want to be treated like an adult.}
<A>__{mr. brooks allows himself a slight smile.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{would you pay for your food, would you pay rent?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no, dad, you're a very wealthy man, you can afford to keep me.}
<A>__{mr. brooks presses his intercom.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{sunday, would you show the gentleman who gave you the envelope to the conference room, and tell him i will meet him there and...}
<P>__{(to jane)}
<D>__{what happened to the bmw?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{a friend is driving it across country, it'll be here next weekend.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(to sunday, through intercom)}
<D>__{and get jane a cab.}
<A>__{he picks up the phone and holds it out to jane.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{call your mother.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{are you going to give me a job?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{if it were up to me, and i think your mother will agree with this, you should go back to school.}
