<L>__{exterior lani's front porch late afternoon}
<A>__{barb higgins answers the door.}
<C>__{barb higgins}
<D>__{thank you for coming by.}
<L>__{interior lani's house continuous}
<A>__{as matt and scottie are shown inside, they remove their shoes.}
<C>__{barb higgins}
<D>__{i forgot to mention the time scottie said she didn't want to be lani's partner at the rock wall because she didn't want to fall into my daughter's butt crack. that doesn't even make sense.}
<A>__{barb now leads them into the tv room where lani higgins sits on a couch. matt is impatient to be done with this meaningless task.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{scottie, do you have something you want to say to lani?}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{lani}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{great. well, nice meeting you both. lani, you should come over sometime. come for a swim or a hike or something.}
<C>__{barb higgins}
<D>__{scottie, the things you said were simply evil. do you realize that? i don't know what's led you to be such a nasty young lady.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hey, hey. we came over. she apologized. we're dealing with it. kids are mean sometimes. they grow out of it. it's a kid thing. here, scottie, you're going to stop, right? and you're really, really sorry, right?}
<A>__{scottie makes a big exaggerated nod.}
<C>__{barb higgins}
<D>__{i don't think she's sorry at all. she's going to keep doing it. i can tell.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no, she won't. it's like the time lani locked scottie out of the house at her birthday party and scottie sat outside by herself. it was a mean thing to do, but lani here probably did it just to show off, right?}
<A>__{lani thinks a moment, nods.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{but i'm not about to declare that one action defines a human being's entire character. she's a work in progress, and like all complex people is a bundle of contradictions.}
<C>__{barb higgins}
<D>__{i didn't know about that.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{you brought me cake.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you brought her cake. so, i don't know, maybe lani should be the one to apologize, since this incident may have been the catalyst for all this... "evil" was the word you used.}
