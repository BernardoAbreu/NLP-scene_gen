<A>__{hellboy labors up a steep slope, using rocks and roots for handholds. he reaches a dead end and collapses, out of breath. light filters through a crack in the ground; he can faintly hear liz and myers.}

<C>__{liz}
<D>__{oh, my god...}
<A>__{myers turns. his flashlight comes back on, revealing a complex natural cavern. an entire wall is covered with translucent eggs. sammael is there, gnawing on a dry arm bone, with the hand still attached. when the light hits his face, his milky pupils constrict. a snarl... a second sammael emerges from the water. it shakes itself off. a third one raise its head. myers and liz try to back away, but a metal wall rises right behind them klankkkkk!!! they are trapped!! myers goes to grab a set of explosive belts. tries to set up the timer. zipp! one sammael snatches them away. myers falls to the ground, clothes torn, injured.}
