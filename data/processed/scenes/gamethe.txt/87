<D>__{mind if i smoke in here?}

<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(leaning forward)}
<D>__{up here on the left.}
<A>__{as the limo pulls over, he and christine turn to each other. it's a somewhat awkward moment.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{so what's our next move? i mean, in the game. obviously we need to figure out what that crank thing is for }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i'm not playing anymore.}
<C>__{christine}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i have a life. jack'll take you home, or wherever you want to go.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{yeah, maybe i will get in a little ballroom dancing before bed }
<A>__{the limo has stopped now. schuyler has started to open the door.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{wait, what about your clothes?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{forget it.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{c'mon it's a brand new sweatshirt.}
<A>__{so saying, she pulls it off. she's wearing a black bra... a rose is tattooed on her shoulder. schuyler can't help but react. she thrusts the shirt at him, he's half out of the car.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{no, it's not just back from the cleaners.}
<C>__{christine}
<P>__{(throatily)}
<D>__{you dry clean your sweatshirts...}
<A>__{he nods slightly... as he reaches to take it christine leans forward, cups the back of his head and gives him a long, hard kiss. jack the driver, middle aged and trustworthy, turns and catches a glimpse of this, quickly turns away. christine breaks the kiss, sinks back against the red leather seat, waiting for schuyler to make the next move.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{see ya.}
<A>__{schuyler nods again, torn. she's looking at him expectantly. he's clearly aroused, but this is such an inappropriate female. sadly, he waves a hand.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{good night.}
