<L>__{interior bank night}
<A>__{sylvia is finishing her typing. the girls and mulvaney are slowly getting ready. deborah is getting her purse out of margaret's desk drawer; margaret gathering her own purse, books, etc.; jenny is getting her purse from edna's desk as edna gathers up her belongings; mulvaney is seated at his desk; miriam is at her desk, by the front door. sal stands with his gun ready. [as sonny enters and takes up his gun, sal carefully and methodically begins to redress himself, comb his rumpled hair, knotting his tie carefully...]}
<B>__{angles favoring sal}
<A>__{as he rebuilds his sartorial image before the various reflecting surfaces of the bank, knotting his tie in a glass partition, checking his suit for wrinkles in a glass door, etc. meanwhile we are seeing the following, which sal ignores:}
