<A>__{it's raining like hell. flashes of lightning reveal momentary glimpses of a decayed urban industrial landscape. far below us, a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the drowning earth. we descend toward the rock. sporadic flashes of lightning distort our perspective of the stone. it looks strangely beautiful, like a diamond stuck in the dark mud... closer... closer... suddenly, strong male hands cut across the frame and wrench it free from its muddy grave. even closer... and we discover that the underbelly of this beautiful rock is teeming with every kind of slithering repulsive insect... flash!! lightning obliterates the frame. ( flashes of light from lightning, car headlights, photographic strobe units and flashlights are used throughout the following sequences as recurring transitional devices.)}

<A>__{flash!! an oncoming car's headlights streak across the beat up chevy's windshield... revealing... the driver, 45ish, as he leans across the passenger seat and opens the car door. the pretty teenage girl slides into the car. dressed only in a skirt and t shirt, she's soaked to the skin. make up runs down her face and her hair sticks to her bare shoulders. she seems nervous... scared even.}

<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{as she closes the car door the man notices that her hand has been injured. it's bound with coarse white toweling and stained with blood. in her other hand, she clings tightly to a cheap yellow leather purse. he reaches forward and puts his hand on the gear shift, the back of his hand brushing against her leg, she moves away. he slides the gear shift into drive. another car's headlights flare the windshield as he pulls out into the night.}

<A>__{suddenly... a powerful photographic strobe light ignites! revealing a decrepit warehouse interior. silhouetted briefly against the paint chipped walls are two figures: a man, brian kessler, 25, short chopped hair dressed in black on black, and a woman, carrie laughlin, 25, short black hair and tight black clothes. carrie holds a 35mm still camera, an umbilical cord runs to a strobe light. brian holds a flashlight in one hand, a tape recorder in the other. he begins speaking into the tape recorder.}

<L>__{interior 70's chevy night}
<A>__{a blinding flash!! as... a semi trailer crosses paths with the 70's chevy. close on the girl. an intent expression on her face as she watches and waits... for the cigarette lighter to eject. his hand reaches deeper into her purse. the driver tenses as he sees this. suddenly... pop!! the lighter ejects. the driver reaches for the dash. the girl hurriedly lifts something out from inside the bag. the driver yanks the lighter out... and whips a look to the girl.}

<A>__{brian's flashlight sweeps across the shadowed remains of the rafters and catwalks. scanning... listening... brian and carrie glance tentatively at each other... then slowly carrie lifts the portable strobe unit upward until it is pointing into the rafters. carrie fires a shot, triggering a brilliant flash!!}

<L>__{exterior freeway night}
<A>__{the chevy brakes... skids across the rain slicked pavement and turns a somersault, landing upside down on its hood. another angle: closer the camera drifts across the fractured front end of the overturned chevy. the twisted hunk of metal hisses... steams... groans. the front tire spins lazily to a halt on its mangled axle. in the background high overhead we see a man standing on a highway overpass. he's leaning on the railing and calmly looking down at the wrecked car.}

<A>__{early grayce, 25, athletic build, big watery eyes, jet black hair, stands by the railing. rain streaks down his expressionless face. he dropped the rock. early's pov the 70's chevy lying in the deserted highway. the driver crawls out covered with blood. still clutched in his hand is the car cigarette lighter. its red hot coil extinguishing quickly to a faint glow. angle: closer on early calmly looking down with no pity. even closer... water running down his face. closer yet... on his eye... and right into the dilated pupil. as we enter it it's like being in a dark winding tunnel filled with the hum of dynamos and the loud rhythmic pumping of powerful machinery.}
