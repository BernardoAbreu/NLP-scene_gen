<L>__{exterior the grand ticino an italian restaurant night}
<A>__{a red neon sign hangs in the window. it's a quaint downstairs restaurant in greenwich village. a young couple stop, look at the menu, become more interested in each other, kiss, and decide to go in.}
<L>__{interior the grand ticino night}
<A>__{white tablecloths and dark green walls, a tiny bar up by the door. the waiters all look a little alike. that's because they're all related. the place is about half full, and bustles along pleasantly.}
<B>__{music}
<A>__{a violin plays a melancholy neapolitan air. mr. johnny and loretta sit at a table for two talking quietly. they have their menus and glasses of red wine. mr. johnny is italian, around 42. his wavy salt and pepper hair is impeccably combed back; but there is so much that it threatens to fall forward someday and engulf his face. he is wearing a pinky ring, a dark suit, a gold watch, and, on his face, a mustache and a look of incredible seriousness. loretta is italian, 37. her black hair, done in a dated style, is flecked with grey. she is wearing a dark blouse, black skirt, and high heels. one of her teeth is framed with gold work. mr. johnny is really timid of life, an overgrown boy, who hides these qualities behind a veil of dignity. loretta is tough and efficient, loyal and watchful; she watches out for mr. johnny, and defends him against life. bobo, an old world italian waiter, comes over to take their order.}

<D>__{a man who can't control his woman is funny.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{she was too young for him.}
<A>__{mr. johnny considers this a point well taken.}
<B>__{bobo and his nephew eddie stand near the kitchen}

<A>__{perry lets go of his arm. he and the shy waiter commiserate a moment. then, wordlessly, the shy waiter goes.}
<C>__{perry}
<D>__{that's very sad.}
<A>__{bobo is clearing the remains of mr. johnny's dinner. he's already cleared loretta's.}
<C>__{bobo}

<D>__{we got married at the city hall and i think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.}
<C>__{mr. johnny}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{right from the start we didn't do it right. could you kneel down?}
<C>__{mr. johnny}
<D>__{on the floor?}
<C>__{loretta}

<C>__{mr. johnny}
<D>__{this is a good suit.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{i helped you buy it. it came with two pairs of pants. it's for luck, johnny. when you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.}
<C>__{mr. johnny}
<D>__{alright.}
<A>__{mr. johnny slowly gets out of his chair. there's not enough room for him to kneel down. he has to ask two off duty pro wrestlers who are eating dinner to move their chairs. they do so with bemused expressions. their names are bob and mook.}

<B>__{bobo and eddie stand near the kitchen watching}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{she's got him on his knees. he's ruining his suit.}
<B>__{loretta and mr. johnny}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{you could use your pinky ring.}
<C>__{mr. johnny}
<D>__{i like this ring.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{you propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.}

<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{yes, johnny. yes, john anthony cammareri. i will marry you. i will be your wife.}
<A>__{mr. johnny slowly stands up, brushes off his knees. the restaurant has fallen utterly silent. loretta smiles. they embrace. loretta kisses him quickly. a middle aged woman, susan, is maudlin from the proposal bobo stands very near her table. she is about to applaud the proposal. she brings her hands together. bobo's hand flashes out and neatly captures her hands before they can part again. the single sound dies abruptly in the silent room.}

<C>__{shy waiter}
<D>__{she didn't hear me. she asked me to repeat, so she could understand what i said. but i wouldn't repeat it. outta shyness. so i'm a bachelor.}
<B>__{mr. johnny and loretta}
<A>__{he's helping her on with her coat.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{what time is it?}
