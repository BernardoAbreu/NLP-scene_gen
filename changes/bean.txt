<LOC>__{EXT. MR BEAN'S STREET. DAY}
<ACTION>__{Mr BEAN comes out of his house, ready to face the world- He walks up the street, tutting slightly at a 'NO PARKING' sign he passes. The street is totally car-free except for a very visible lime green mini. A policeman strolls by and glances down at a pair of legs sticking out from under it, next to a toolbox. He moves on, satisfied that someone is mending their car. BEAN approaches the car and whips out the fake legs he left there. He then unlocks the big padlock that secures the car door, pops the fake legs inside, fiddles with something else in the back seat, and drives away at a frightening speed with a smug look on his face. The Theme Music - big and dramatic - begins, as do the rest of the credits. BEAN gaily motors on - then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune jumps, as if it has hit a scratch: the cinema audience should be worried there's a sound fault. BEAN comes to a street full of sleeping policemen he goes at them at quite a lick - and every time he shoots over one of the bumps, the theme tune jumps violently. BEAN looks a little annoyed into the back seat - we now see the cause of the problem. Instead of having a car radio, BEAN has an old record player strapped into the back seat, playing the theme tune. On he drives, through empty streets - then JOLT - he's reached the glorious familiarity of Central London, Big Ben and all - but heels now in dreadful traffic. Heels not happy. He looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway. He takes out a metal comb from his pocket and, using it like a bomber's sight- line-checker, measures the front of his car and the width of the alley. He 'S satisfied - does a 90-degree turn - and shoots down the alley. It is such a perfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles as they graze the walls. But at the end of the alley, the traffic's just as bad. BEAN notices he's outside Harrods. There's a tail-coated Security Guard at the 'front door. BEAN watches him stroll a bit down the street - and takes his chance. He turns and drives straight through the double doors, into the store.}

The Guard walks straight past. The moment he is gone, BEAN shoots off again - but, damn!, spies another Guard and is forced to turn and drive down some very steep stairs indeed. The theme song goes CRAZY as the record player jumps.}

<ACTION>__{BEAN nods. This is what BEAN likes to do best. The camera follows as he turns sees the extraordinary sight behind him... His office is just a tiny corner of a massive storage room, hundreds of feet high and long, the walls completely full of rack after rack of stored paintings. At the end of the room, we can see hundreds of sculptures: busts, modern abstracts, men on horses, classical maidens, Rodins, the lot. It's like the giant storehouse at the end of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark. BEAN sets off into it in his own eccentric way. He knows exactly where heels going. He climbs a ladder, like you find in a library - then pushes himself off, and whizzes the entire length of the room on slippery wooden runners. He has now reached the sculpture area, but the painting heels looking for is on the other side. He crosses the room by using the sculptures as a kind of artistic obstacle course. In front of him is the Burghers of Calais, a Rodin statue of 5 prisoners in chains. He simply walks across their 5 heads, like stones in a stream. He then comes to an abstract modern piece, which he uses as a slide and at the end of which, he crawls through the hole in the next modern thing. He then begins to climb up various famous ancient statues, using the mouths as footholes, breasts as support, codpieces as steps and empty eyes as finger holes. After a problem getting his. foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured dog, he walks flat along a modern sculpture, then uses a sequence of classic sculptures as stairs - on the head of a little Degas ballerina, one step on to the bottom of a horse, two steps onto the head of the person riding the horse, three steps and now he's on the other side of the hall. He then triumphantly pulls out a painting. It's the one!,}

He whips out his pair of imaginary six shooters, spins them on his fingers and returns them to-their imaginary holsters, making gun sound effects. He's very happy.-He passes the Security Guard - he draws his gun on him - zero reaction the Guard just raises his eyebrows and yawns. BEAN heads on through the gallery merrily - but suddenly, his good mood is broken, when he notices 3 schoolgirls entering a new exhibition, called The Ultra-Human Form. This worries him - and we soon see why - BEAN heads in to the room where all the paintings are very graphic nudes, and the 3 girls are having a good giggle. BEAN quickly rushes over and with his hand covers the breasts of the painting they're inspecting. Two girls then move on to the next painting - which unfortunately also has breasts. BEAN stretches and just manages to cover them with his other hand. Now the third girl heads on, so BEAN can drop the hand on the first painting - but now has to try to cover the breasts on the third painting, which is a real long stretch away. He can't quite make it, so he takes off his shoes, which gives him the extra 3 inches. Again, safe. Just. Now, all three girls leave the paintings - but, to BEAN's chagrin, head over to a classical nude sculpture in the middle of the room. It's like the 3 Graces, 3 naked women back to back. BEAN thinks fast. He quickly whips off his Belt and rushes over to the statue, where he succeeds in looping it round to cover all six nipples. Unfortunately the girls have already lost interest and head over to the other side of the gallery. To BEAN's horror. Because at that moment we reveal what is on the other side of the room. A epic painting in the style of the others - with literally 40 graphically naked people. BEAN sprints across the room, stands on a chair, and desperately tries to cover a particularly lurid example of a gentleman's manhood. At which moment the teacher of the party and 40 other schoolgirls appear and scream in chorus. BEAN thinks that it is the painting that has caused offence and is in outraged agreement with them. He turns. Cut wide to reveal that they are screaming because he's beltless trousers have fallen down.}

It is now busy removing Whistler's Mother's face entirely. As Bean watches-in frozen horror, America's most famous painting turns back to a blank canvas. BEAN thinks for a second - and then has a desperate thought. Removing the pen that started all the trouble, he decides to try to draw back on Whistler's Mother's 'face. He doesn't have much time. It shows. Where once was a sublime oil painting, is now a biro line-drawing which looks a little like Danny de Vito. Bean lifts it against the wall to check how it's worked. Unfortunately, there's a nail there. The picture tears, Bean panics - it tears even more. Total destruction.}

BEAN giggles. BEAN is satisfied he'll be uninterrupted for a while. He goes to the key- rack, borrows two keys, and sets off on his mission. The next 3 minutes of film are a sequence of cuts between three scenarios: FIRST: BUCK - his next 10 minutes are not happy ones. When he reaches the toilet, the key he chose does not unlock it. He has to sprint back, grab all the keys, and charge back again to the door. Then he has to try out every single key. We never see him find the right one. SECOND scenario - all the activities of the night shown on the security monitors. BUCK sprinting desperately through shot - BEAN casually going about his business and, on one occasion, BUCK running right past BEAN, but not seeing him - he has other things on his mind. THIRD scenario - we actually see BEAN's Big Plan. He unlocks the merchandise shop. So he can see properly and have his hands free, he puts the y-fronts on his head, and wedges the torch into them, like a head-lamp. He then takes a poster of Whistler's Mother and replaces it with the rolled-up Tennis Ball Girl. He unrolls the Whistler and places the 4 encyclopaedias on its corners to hold it down. He separates the yokes from the eggs, mixes the whites with clear nail varnish and varnishes the-poster with it. Dries it off with the hair drier. ,With the now stiff poster, he heads up elevators and escalators to get to the Whistler Room itself, all the time chewing gum frantically. Once there, he unlocks the final cupboard with David's plastic key, takes the Whistler down and removes the destroyed Mother from its gilded frame, and its wooden support frame. He uses the chewed gum to stick the new one down to the old frame. He then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security cupboard and relocks it with DAVID's key card. The job is done. He scrunches up the old, torn picture, pops it in a dustbin, and heads off.}
