<L>__{exterior road chase day}
<A>__{as madmartigan lashes the horse, willow crawls up to hum and takes the baby.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{we could've been killed, madmarti gan!}
<A>__{in the back, the brownies boucne all over the place amid wooden kegs and other objects. when they finally get their balane they look back in alarm. chasing them are two nockmaar horsemen plus a death dog and a war chariot. willow ducks low and peeks out, protectively hugging the baby. the wagon bounces and flies along, but the minions are quickly gaining. rool and teemo spring into action. they struggle with all their might and manage to kck small wooden kegs off the back of the wagon. the kegs bounce onto the road, and the minions lose some ground trying to avoid them. but soon the horse men flank the wagon. one leaps off his galloping horse and climbs on board. the other draws an arrow and gets ready to fire. madmartigan is about to be shot between the eyes. he quickly rolls into the back. the archer firse! and hits the other minion in the chest. madmartigna snaps a wooden stake off the wagon side and smashes the wounded minion off the wagon: he crashes onto the road. willow harnesses the papoose to his chest and grabs the reins. at the same time the minion archer leaps aboard. he and madmartigan fight in the back.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{heeyah! heeyah!}
<A>__{then there's a terrible howl right beside willow. the death dog is leaping alongside the wagon, gnashing and trying to board. willow yanks the reins and swerves the wagon into the dog, which yelps furiously. in the back, madmartigan and the minion are thrown by the swerving jolt.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{oh no!}
<A>__{up ahead willow sees an exposed tree root in the road. the wagon is headed straight for it! the wheel hits the root hard and willow is dumped onto the wagon floor and very nearly goes overboard. in the back, madmartigan and the minion keep fighting as the wagon clatter along out of control. the death dog catches up again and this time spring aboard.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{bordak!!}
<A>__{the dog snaps at the baby. willow scurries under the wagon seat. the dog stands up on its hind feet.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{bordak!!}
<A>__{it gets ready to attack. but whack! an overhanging tree branch hits it and willow looks up from under the seat and sees the mangled dog twitching and dangling from the tree, rapidly disappearing in the distance. in the back, meanwhile, the minion draws a knife. mad martigan ducks out of his way, hanging onto a post at the edge of the tailgate. the minion comes after him. suddenly the wagon wheel wobbles and the rim flies off. the jolt throws the minion off balance. madmartigan kicks him. the minion hurtles off the taligate but holds on, dragged by the wagon. rool and teemo grab hold of a rope securing a large wooden keg. together they yank it. untying the keg and sending it tumbling off the back. the minion looks up in horror as the heavy keg crushes him. but the danger is far from over. the wagon rocks along with one wheel half destroyed. willow whips the reins and looks over his shoulder. steam rolling toward them is the war chariot! the nockmaar chariot driver stands up and stuffs the reins in his mouth. he rasise his arm and begins to twirl a deadly weapon, a kind of bolo blade, over his head. madmartigan defends himself with a wooden wagon post. the chariot driver hurls the whistling blade: chonk! it lodges in the post. madmartigan tugs. so does the chariot driver. back and forth, the wagons smashing up each other. at last madmartigan lets go of the post and the chariot driver is sent tumbling through the airl, over a cliff to his death.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{woah...woah...!}
<A>__{willow tries to stop the horse. but the wheel col lapses and he is thrown off into a ditch. the brownies dive overboard. madmartigan jumps off and delibrerately sends the wagon up the road. he scrambles down into the ditch and lies flat beside willow. suddenly, hoofbeats thunder and sorsha and the rest of her troops gallop past. lying flat, madmartigna raises his head and sees sorsha's long flowing red hair.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{that girl is a vision.}
<A>__{as soon as the troops are gone, willow jumps up.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{where's the baby??}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i thought you had her! rool teemo willow!!}
<A>__{the brownies are waving and gesturing madly, pointing at a heap of boards and rubble that broke off the wagon. willow and madmartigan race over and start dig ging, flinging debris aside.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{now willow, i know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{elora danan!}
<A>__{willow sees the battered, lifeless papoose. he grabs it and rips it open. madmartigan kneels in the dirt remorsefully.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{when i left the crossroads, i got ambushed by an elf!}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{madmartigan! you saved her life!}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i did?}
<A>__{willow holds up the baby. she giggles and smiles. madmartigan switches gears, boasting:}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i mean, of course i saved her life. she's almost my daughter, isn't she?}
<A>__{willow bundles the baby and looks up the road.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{let's get out of here before they come back.}
<A>__{they hurry off into the darkening woods.}
