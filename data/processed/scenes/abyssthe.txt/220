<A>__{now the fight is really on. the two subs are dodging between the cylindrical modules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure hulls. coffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways. it screeches along the flank of one of the trimodules. they head out over empty terrain in a flat out speed run. lindsey is jinking and dodging as flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing up the bottom with its powerful backwash. lindsey carves hard around a rock pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon. coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side. lindsey snarls. he's pissing her off. he shouldn't do that. ahead, out of the blackness, another outcropping. lindsey rises, cuts right. smashes down into coffey's craft. timing it just right. he skids catch in the rocks. flatbed slews violently, nosing down. crushing into the rocky bottom. pressing the advantage, lindsey hammers into flatbed from behind. it smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control. tangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the wall. with her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of flatbed and grounds her crippled sub. flatbed tumbles over the edge. angle down the wall as it falls, trailing a cloud of sediment like a comet's tail, down into the unfathomable blackness below.}
