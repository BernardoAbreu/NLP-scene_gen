<L>__{interior office morning}
<A>__{an anonymous, luxurious office. a fat, balding, semi conscious man lies curled up on the floor as elena, half undressed and wearing a black wig, shovels cash into her oversized purse... there's a crackle on her walkie talkie...}
<C>__{kristen }
<D>__{we got problems...}
<A>__{from outside, she can hear the wailing of sirens. getting closer.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{almost done here.}
<C>__{kristen }
<D>__{leave it. come on!}
<A>__{elena gets hesitantly to her feet, slides a stack of $100s in her pocket for good measure.}
<C>__{kristen }
<D>__{he gonna be able to make an id?}
<A>__{elena glances at the man on the floor, his puffy eyes glazed over like a jelly donut.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{not on your life. i gave him enough roofies to make an elephant forget.}
