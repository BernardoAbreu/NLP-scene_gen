<A>__{a christmas festive atmosphere. the casino interior is decorated with red and green balloons, silver and gold streamers, a large tree hung with 1000 chips. jack is dealing at a blackjack table. like the other croupiers and dealers, he is dressed in a fancy red coat with green trim. he wears a silly paper hat. the punters at jack's table include mr tchai and four expensively dressed chinese men. the bodyguard stands behind them. they are gambling big money. wads of 50 notes are changed into 100 chips. jack is coolly winning for the house. reynolds looks on impassively in his santa claus suit. three or four punters are watching the chinese lose heavily. mr tchai and his friends occasionally exchange a phrase in chinese but they show no emotion as they lose. with each hand they prepare to lose even more. jack pushes hundreds of pounds into the box beneath the table. reynolds signals a security man to collect the cash which is building up. he comes over with a safety cart. during a short break the money is taken from under the table in a box, loaded into the cart and wheeled away.}
