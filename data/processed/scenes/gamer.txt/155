<L>__{interior fbi interrogation time indeterminate}
<A>__{simon is in a stark interrogation room, alone, drumming his fingers on the table thumb to pinky, pinky to thumb. trying not to show how scared he is. the door clicks open and several men enter. one sits. we only see them from behind, not their faces; simon nods waddup. the seated man pushes several photos across the table to simon. simon glances at the top photo as casually as he can manage it shows simon in an mtv trl type setting, being interviewed in front of a live audience of teenage girls. when agent keith speaks, he is calm, conversational.}
<C>__{agent keith}
<D>__{guess you remember that day.}
<A>__{simon nods, noncommitally.}
<C>__{agent keith }
<D>__{you'd just gotten kable through his tenth consecutive session alive... no one ever thought an i con could last that long.}
<A>__{another photo shows simon on a jumbotron posing with his fingers in the camera's face, throwing the motion control hand signal for fire and kill... in another, he's being mobbed at an event, signing an amazing pair of breasts with a black marker.}
<C>__{agent keith }
<D>__{pretty hot shit, aren't you? king player.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{good times.}
<C>__{agent keith}
<D>__{sure. on the outside. now look at these.}
<A>__{a new series of graphic photos show bloody, mangled remains the aftermath of a slayers session.}
<C>__{agent keith }
<D>__{this is what it's like on the inside.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{wonder how long you'd last on the other side of the screen.}
<A>__{this sits in the room for a beat simon considers several responses, chooses none of them.}
<C>__{agent keith }
<D>__{simon, you're being held today suspected of aiding in the escape of a convicted murderer from a maximum security penitentiary. the charge is... beyond serious. your hard drives have been seized forensics is decrypting the contents as we speak. your internet activity over the last ten years is being scrutinized and catalogued in minute, vivid detail...}
<A>__{simon flinches at this one.}
<C>__{agent keith }
<D>__{in addition, your father's bank accounts have been frozen pending further investigation naturally, seeing it was his money that essentially funded mr. tillman's escape.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm going to need you to tell me everything that happened leading up to yesterday afternoon. everyone you talked to, everything you heard, everything you did. i need you to do that... right now.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{yeah, um... i need something too.}
<C>__{agent keith}
<P>__{(ice cold)}
<D>__{do you now? and what might that be?}
<A>__{simon swallows hard.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{could you dudes do a sandwich like: peanut butter, almond butter, walnut butter... pecan butter, pistachio butter... pretty much any kind of, you know, nut butter. and welch's grape.}
<A>__{dead silence. simon chews a hanging chad off of a fingernail.}
<C>__{agent keith}
