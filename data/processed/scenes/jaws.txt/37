<L>__{interior ferry boat day}
<A>__{two cavernous iron doors. then a crack of vertical light as six burly crewmen muscle them apart. the amity ferry landing is approaching, people in colorful outfits waiting dockside for the first filled to capacity shuttle of the summer season and bach's little fugue is the musical accompaniment to this wholly visual montage of disembarkation. the next two minutes should be treated like a "short film" taking into account all of the colors, episodes, faces and behavior of a variety of americans who colonize eastern resort communities for the ninety day season. intercut with this montage is brody's home, where ellen, hooper and brody are in sweaty, gritty all out effort to enlist some support. elements in this montage include: a. a train of cars trundling down the ramp, bumper to bumper. b. young beautiful people from princeton, yale, nyu, wearing knapsacks, toting luggage, babies riding in papoose rigs, energized children, senior citizens holding hands on the pedestrian ramp, a few wheelchairs. c. hooper, bent over the phone: "i know it's a long weekend, could you get me his home phone number? d. sidewalk vendors hawking "shark killed" souvenirs, big photo "personality posters" of the dead tiger shark hung on the dock. e. brody: "you're acting senior officer? where's chief petty officer feldman? where's the coast guard executive officer?" f. souvenir stands selling genuine sharks teeth from the amity killer shark, captured this week. g. amity cab company, small blue toyotas lined up with their college student drivers like a bomber wing. h. hooper: "well then, operator, could you try him in the dining room?" i. brody: "all i get is a recording. is there some other number i could try...?" j. station wagons with pale winter faces pressed anxiously to the window. cadillacs with rear admirals at the helm, their wives with blue hair remembering the way from years before. k. hooper: "when did he check out? did he leave another phone number?" l. brody: "how can i reach him in chambers if he's not in chambers?" m. little karate hands breaking picket fences. n. some local delinquents about 10 or 12 years old, towing behind their bicycles a little dead sand shark with signs: "amity monster shark." "killed here." 5 cents a hit." etc. then six blonde and tanned coney island meatballs descend the ramp. they all wear men's club lifeguard patches and matching collegiate windbreakers. they scour the landing, looking for someone to save. the boat is empty. everybody heading inland, anticipating the best fourth of july ever. already there is debris on the docks and the cleaning crew works away at it.}
<B>__{inside the ferry}
<A>__{as bach's little fugue ends, the six burly crewmen lean their combined weight against the cathedral doors, closing out the light and locking in the trade. the doors latch shut with a resounding clang! angle on brody, nervously watching the beach he is studying everything, trying to make sure he has it covered as well as possible. he almost doesn't hear the approaching roar of a small helicopter until it settles down behind him, and a flying officer gets out, starched, pressed fatigues, a flawless fatigue baseball cap, and slick dark aviator's sunglasses. the steve canyon of amity. he presents brody with a clipboard.}

<D>__{martin brody?}

<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i signed on the wrong line...}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{just erase your signature and initial your erasure.}
<A>__{brody complies, shaking his head. the officer snaps him a salute, jogs lightly back to his idling copter, buckles in, and gives brody a "thumbs up" as he lifts off in a flurry of sand and ice cream wrappers.}
