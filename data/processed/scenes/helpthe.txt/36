<L>__{interior leefolt home kitchen later that day}
<A>__{skeeter sits across the table from aibileen, reading the `miss myrna' letters. outside, winds howl, and the sky grows dark. jolene's forecast appears to be a bit off.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{"dear miss myrna, how do i remove the rings from my fat, slovenly husband's shirt collar when he is such a pig and sweats like one too..."}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{which one she want a get rid of? them rings or the husband?}
<A>__{skeeter chuckles and shrugs her shoulders.}
<C>__{aibileen }
<D>__{tell her a vinegar and pine sol soak. then let it set in the sun a bit.}
<A>__{skeeter writes this down.}
<C>__{aibileen }
<D>__{bout an hour. let it dry.}
<A>__{skeeter keeps writing. aibileen notices something outside. hilly walks into the leefolt backyard with her son, billy, 3, perched on her hip. a contractor, 30s, follows holding a set of plans. skeeter turns to the open window. it's already started to sprinkle outside.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{build it just like the one at my house, right against the garage.}
<A>__{the contractor nods. lightning strikes, thunder cracks.}
<C>__{hilly }
<D>__{oh, mercy!}
<A>__{hilly is off and running with billy. skeeter seizes the moment.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{aibileen, do you ever wish you could...change things?}
<A>__{aibileen turns slowly from the window.}
<C>__{skeeter }
<D>__{i mean, all that talk yesterday and now with what hilly's up to.}
<A>__{aibileen's eyes fall to the floor.}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{everthing's fine.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{my momma fired constantine. thank you for telling me that.}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{i never tolt you that!}
<A>__{aibileen jumps up as another crack of thunder sounds out.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{aibileen, i have an idea...something i want to write about...but i need your help.}
<A>__{skeeter rises.}
<C>__{skeeter }
<D>__{i want to interview you...about what it is like to work as a maid.}
<A>__{aibileen stops at the refrigerator, gripping the life out of its handle.}
<C>__{skeeter }
<D>__{i'd like to do a book of interviews about working for white families. show what it's like to work for, say...elizabeth.}
<A>__{aibileen begins to perspire. she grabs the counter to steady herself, then moves toward her chair.}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{you know what'd happen to me if miss leefolt knew i was tellin' stories on her?}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{i was thinking we wouldn't tell her. the other maids will have to keep it secret, too.}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{other maids?}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{i was hoping to get four or five. to really show what it's like in jackson. to see what y'all get paid, the babies, the bathrooms, the good and the bad.}
<A>__{aibileen shakes her head.}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{they set my cousin shinelle's car on fire just cause she went down to the voting station.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{a book has never been written like this, aibileen.}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{`cause they's a reason. i do this with you, i might as well burn my own house down.}
<A>__{bam! the front door slams shut.}
