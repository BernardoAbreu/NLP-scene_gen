<C>__{jason}
<D>__{oh, boy.}
<C>__{desi}
<D>__{that's not good.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{desi}
<D>__{not for me, that's not good. sexually we are completely incompatible.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that's not true.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{that's such a shame. that's as bad as it gets.}
<C>__{desi}
<D>__{what's yours?}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{i'm a cancer.}
<C>__{desi}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{is that good?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what does it mean?}
<C>__{desi}
<D>__{that's really strange. well, taurus and cancers are sort of soul mates of the zodiac. we're like perfectly compatible. i balance what you lack, and you make up for what i lack. and a quiet cancer almost always has a huge penis.}
<C>__{jason}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you're making me embarrassed.}
