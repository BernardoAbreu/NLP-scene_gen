<L>__{exterior pennsylvania steel town day}
<A>__{a bus comes up the hill toward us, on the main street of joe's sooty, little home town, the huge stacks of moribund steel works filling the sky in the background. the bus stops at a corner. joe steps off. no bag. he's not planning on staying long.}
<L>__{exterior joe's house day}
<A>__{joe goes to the front door. knocks, gets no answer, pushes the door open, walks through the messy, cluttered house to the back porch. seated in a metal folding chair, smoking a cigarette, looking out at the yard is joe's dad. he's got a couple days growth of beard, and although not drunk now, he has the look of one.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{how ya doin', dad?}
<C>__{dad}
<P>__{(surprised to see him)}
<D>__{joe! what's this? they throw you out?}

<D>__{i heard about your little set to. they had it on the news here.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yeh, they sent me to rehab.}
<C>__{joe's dad}
<D>__{we know what that's worth. your brother's been through it three times.}
<A>__{joe nods sadly.}
<C>__{joe's dad}
<D>__{so what are you doin' here?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i've been thinking about some things, dad.}
<C>__{joe's dad}
<D>__{that's what that damn rehab'll do. make you think about a lotta things you can't do nothing' about.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i kinda been wonderin' why you never came to any of my games. all those years.}
<C>__{joe's dad}
<D>__{oh, i don't know. i guess i didn't wanta make you nervous. you mighta tried too hard and screwed up.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{or i mighta done real well. which woulda been harder on you, dad?}
<C>__{joe's dad}
<P>__{(sensing the anger)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{mighta made you feel bad. like maybe it wasn't written someplace that we all gotta go on our ass. like maybe you coulda done somethin' more, if you'de tried a little harder.}
<C>__{joe's dad}
<D>__{or maybe i didn't wanta see you gettin' all excited, all pumped up with pride, when i knew one day it would all come crashin' down. just like it did.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i think i spent the last couple years hopin' i'd die before that day. but you know what dad? that day came and i'm still here. and i got one more game this year. i don't know how well i will play or even how much, but i want you there.}
<C>__{joe's dad}
<D>__{how would you feel introducing your drunk dad to all your friends? you think about that?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i could live with it, if you could.}
<P>__{(handing him a ticket)}
<D>__{here's a ticket. section 2, row 6. fifty yard line. if you don't come, i will never ask you again.}
<C>__{joe's dad}
<D>__{o.k., joey. and good luck.}
<A>__{they give each other a short, quick hug. nothing sentimental. joe walks back through the house. his dad stares out at the yard.}
