<L>__{interior bedroom n afternoon}
<A>__{the crime scene technicians shift to accommodate atwood's inspection.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<P>__{(indicating the victims)}
<D>__{he always rearranges the bodies, but this is out of character. he has never left them in such a crude position. usually it's more romantic with their arms around each other, kissing, their mouths open, their tongues touching.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{so we have a copycat?}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{where are the thumbprints?}
<A>__{snyder points to a bare space of wall above the bed. atwood leans in to look at two bloody 'thumbprints' placed side by side.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{one his one hers?}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{that's what it looks like.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{there are two holes gouged into the plaster of the wall.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{the bullets went completely through the victims. the killer recovered the slugs.}
<A>__{atwood unfolds and after another look around the room goes to the window and cracks the curtains. there's the four story apartment building across the alley, its windows staring down at her.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{were these open or closed when you got here?}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{closed.}
<A>__{atwood tries the cord, the curtains are stuck.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{hmm...}
<A>__{she returns her attention to the murder scene.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{it has never been revealed to the public that the thumbprint killer retrieves the slugs.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{so this one's yours.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{i don't fucking need this.}
<A>__{she doubles back and cracks the curtains for another look at the four story apartment building.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{have you checked the tenants of that building?}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{only a few of them are home, they say they didn't see anything. we checked the whole neighborhood, so far nobody saw a thing.}
<A>__{atwood nods and turns back to the bodies.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{leaving them like this, he must have been angry at them for some reason.}
<A>__{she reaches down and runs a hand over the carpet.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{where would they keep their vacuum cleaner.}
<A>__{a puzzled snyder follows her out of the room.}
