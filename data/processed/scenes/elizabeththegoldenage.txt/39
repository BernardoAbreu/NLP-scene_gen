<L>__{exterior windsor great park day}
<A>__{horses racing, hoofs pounding over the grass, manes flying two riders hurtle between the trees, down a woodland ride, neck and neck elizabeth and raleigh are racing against each other, faces glowing, laughing, abandoned to the breakneck speed of the moment. raleigh is winning now, first by a head, then by a length. at the end of the ride he slows his horse to a walk.}

<D>__{mine!}
<A>__{elizabeth shakes her head, unable to speak.}
<C>__{elizabeth}

<D>__{yours carries the lighter load.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{the queen does not give way to others.}

<D>__{whoa! whoa!}
<P>__{(at elizabeth, reigning in the horse)}
<D>__{forgive me, majesty. my horse doesn't know his place yet}
<A>__{elizabeth looks at him, amused, intrigued.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{have you ever known your place, mr. raleigh?}
<A>__{she urges her horse forward, forcing raleigh to catch up.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{i'm surprised you're not married yet.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{i'm a sailor, majesty.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{and can sailors not be lovers?}

<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{must lovers be husbands?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{ah, i see. you like love better than marriage. that i understand.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{your majesty is not eager to be married?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{when i marry, i marry for my country.}
<P>__{(looking at raleigh)}
<D>__{when i love, i love for myself.}

<P>__{(with a smile)}

<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{i would want someone who knows me as i am.}
<A>__{now it is elizabeth who hesitates. he understands her as well.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you want a friend, not just an equal. you want someone to share your joy when you're happy. double blue july 8 p.43b}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{someone to cry with when you're sad. someone to talk to when there's nothing to say. someone to find by your side when you wake in the night. someone who remembers what you once were, when you've grown old.}
<A>__{she turns to him with a smile.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{ah yes. i know all about it. there. i'm rested now.}
<A>__{she turns her horse around in the direction from which they came. raleigh follows.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{we can be something to each other, i hope, mr. raleigh.}
<A>__{she spurs her horse, and suddenly she's racing away, back across the park to the distant band of mounted courtiers and queen's ladies, including bess. raleigh spurs his horse to follow, also fast, but this time careful to keep a distance behind. as they near the courtiers, raleigh splits off. bess watches as elizabeth turns and looks after him as he rides}
