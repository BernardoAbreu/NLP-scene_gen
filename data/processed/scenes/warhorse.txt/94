<L>__{exterior hospital area. same.}
<A>__{joey stands breathing very deeply. the doctor touches his wounded leg. the men from all over the medical area gather around joey concerned about their new hero's pain. the doctor looks at the geordie and frowns shaking his head "no."}
<C>__{geordie}
<P>__{(to the doctor:)}
<D>__{he was alive, y'see, sir, where nothing survives, so to me and me mates, to the men, sir, he's well, we have high hopes for him }
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{you should shoot him now.}
<A>__{the geordie is broken hearted.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{oh, but i can't.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{it'd be a mercy, lad, that leg's not going to mend.}
<A>__{the doctor sadly addresses a nearby sergeant.}
<C>__{doctor }
<D>__{sergeant. put him out of his misery.}
<A>__{the doctor nods his head towards joey. the sergeant, sergeant fry, takes his gun from his holster, checks that it's loaded. he turns to some nearby nurses, urging them away.}
<C>__{sergeant fry}
<D>__{ladies, if you please.}
<A>__{total silence from the crowd who have gathered. they thought they were there to see something wonderful. and now they find that they've gathered for an execution but can't take their eyes off it. the sergeant waves them back.}
<C>__{sergeant fry }
<D>__{all right, back off. back off.}
<A>__{the geordie is the last to step away from joey. the sergeant draws breath before he steps forward to take aim. joey is totally still, sensing the atmosphere. the sergeant cocks his pistol. suddenly there is a strange owl like whistle from fifty yards away. joey looks around startled. the sergeant turns joey's head back around, raises his pistol once more. then, the whistle again. even the doctor notices this time. joey turns. slowly, the crowd parts another owl whistle and we see albert, his eyes bandaged walking forward blindly guided by the hands of the crowd. one soldier urges albert gently.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{go on. do it again.}
<A>__{one more whistle.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{joey?}
<A>__{and this time, joey trots over to albert. the horse nuzzles into him. albert can't see joey but he touches him.}
<C>__{albert }
<P>__{(softly:)}
<D>__{hello, joey. hello boy. where you been then, hey? where in the world you been?}
<A>__{he strokes joey's mane. joey responds, becoming very still. the doctor approaches with the geordie.}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(to the geordie:)}
<D>__{do you know this man?}
<A>__{the geordie shakes his head, no. the doctor speaks to albert, gently; clearly he thinks he's dealing with a traumatized, possibly crazy soldier.}
<C>__{doctor }
<D>__{what's your name?}
<A>__{albert, realizing he's being addressed, turns to the doctor.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{narracott, private albert narracott, sir.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{this is a random horse, narracott, and too badly injured.}
<P>__{(to the orderly)}
<D>__{is this man in your care?}
<C>__{an orderly}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{he's not random at all, sir! he's my horse, i raised him, in devon. sir, look at his legs! he's got four white socks, he's brown all over }
<P>__{(points to his own forehead)}
<D>__{ and he has a white mark here like so...}
<A>__{he makes the shape of a diamond with his hands. the doctor turns to the orderly.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{take him back.}
<C>__{an orderly}
<D>__{come on, son.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{wait! you can't see `cause of the mud.}
<A>__{the geordie looks around, spots a bucket of water, grabs it and uses a rag to clean joey's legs, revealing the socks. the geordie looks at the doctor.}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{four white socks!}
<A>__{the doctor takes a rag himself and wipes joey's snout, revealing the white diamond mark. the sergeant takes this in...and holsters his pistol.}
<C>__{sergeant fry}
<D>__{all right, break it up. clear off, the lot of ya.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{you see, sir? he's not random at all.}
<A>__{the doctor steps up to him.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{we will attend to your horse. patch him up best we can. treat him like the soldier he is.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<A>__{with one last amazed look at albert and joey, the doctor returns to the hospital area. moments later albert, the geordie, and sergeant fry all lead joey through the snowy street together.}
