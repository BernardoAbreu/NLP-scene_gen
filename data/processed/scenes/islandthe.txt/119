<A>__{lincoln and ester emerge into the colonnade, rejoining the flow of figures. lincoln presses the pace, alert, darting looks back. the pale man doesn't appear to be following. but the sense of danger is spurring him to gain distance. ester, vicarious to the danger, stays close to lincoln's side, scurrying to keep up. neither of them notices the grey vehicle sliding up on them, kerbside. a commercial transit van known as a "cutter", it's a common sight on the streets. the driver leans out of the window hair tied back, dressed in buckskins, we recognize burdon }
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{you folks need a ride?}
<A>__{lincoln and ester turn to look. the dark giant is just another stranger, cast in a demeanor of casual inquiry. he's offering an opportunity to gain distance but lincoln remains hesitant. the sense of danger, turbulent, hard to read. burdon sugars the way }
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{p r i v a t e cab. no state surcharge...}
<A>__{he taps a button and the side door slips open. lincoln looks into the lightless c a v i t y , wavering, uncertain. ester, hugging close, nervous. figures passing, jostling them toward the cavity. the dark giant, looking on expectantly. the pause stretching, then }
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{he y ! what the fuck are you doing, man?}
<A>__{b a c k down the colonnade, the hobo is gesticulating to burdon }
<C>__{the hobo}
<D>__{i told you! they went inside!}
<A>__{the hobo doesn't see lincoln and ester, unwitting that he's just betrayed himself as their shadow... and burdon as their predator. his dog starts barking. lincoln starts backing away with ester, his eyes blackening, the danger surging, the dog barking, the giant's face dropping, the elements converging... they bolt.}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{burdon jams into reverse but his pursuit is cut short by a parked vehicle he swings a look back, jabbing his earpiece }

<D>__{north corner! north corner!}
<A>__{lincoln and ester race up the colonnade against the flow of figures darting and weaving like fish swimming upstream diggs bursts from the north exit launching up the north side of the terminal thinner foot traffic here, faster going lincoln and ester slowing the flow massing under the portico they peel through the holoform p h o e n i x rumbling overhead diggs turning the north corner pausing to touch his earpiece now launching south down the colonnade towards the portico jerking a pair of handcuffs from his belt, ready for the snatch lincoln and ester gaining pace past the portico now, the way opening lincoln's eyes flaring a face in the distance ahead the pale man he swings ester around doubling back to find burdon coming up behind the flow of figures, no obstacle parting at his thunderous onset his quarry, stopped and staring at him almost upon them handcuffs at the ready lincoln freezes caught between the dark giant and the pale man ester cringing to his side the dark giant charging up on them sunlight on metal the sight of the handcuffs triggering him lincoln grabs ester swinging her off the sidewalk lowering her into the lodeway leaping down to join her lode poles pulsing, thrumming rivets on their denims, rattling from the polarity traffic soaring past on lode stream, chest high darting out into traffic lincoln leads ester by the hand like a child across the lanes, dodging, weaving through the gaps claxons b l a r i n g , deafening sunflashes, blinding a sudden shadow a huge freight truck bearing down, no gaps ahead lincoln drags ester to the ground both flattening against the concrete lode bed the shadow engulfing them the truck's hull runners shearing narrowly over their heads the rush of air, sweeping off lincoln's ballcap rousing a storm of dust lincoln and ester choking crawling onward through the dust hull runners scudding overhead maybe only a foot of clearance buoy cables whipping around like cheesewire onwards, crawling across the concrete fighting their way across the lode stream burdon watching from the sidewalk where lincoln and ester first dropped, scouring the trench for a sight of them. now he spots them, climbing up onto the sidewalk the far side of the street. d i g g s now arrives at his side, sweating, out of breath. now seeing their quarry take off up the far side of the street, he turns to his lumberous p a r t n e t , fury mixed with incredulity }
