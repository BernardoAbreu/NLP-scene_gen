<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{i think it's a problem that you never told me about michael. i had to hear it from another patient.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{well, letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i'm a grown woman, dr. emlee. i can take care of myself.}

<D>__{what about michael? do you know the extent of his...}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i know michael's a schizophrenic, and mrs. hallstrom's manic depressive, and john lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and i heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{go ahead and put the guard back up, letty. but you need to know what you're dealing with.}
<C>__{letty}

<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{drugs can help suppress symptoms. but lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.}

<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i don't want to hear anymore.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{i'd like you to promise you won't carry on a relationship with michael. otherwise, i will consider moving one of you to another ward.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{first you tell me to do what i want to, then you tell me to stop.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{all i want you to do is think about what's best for you. really think about it.}
