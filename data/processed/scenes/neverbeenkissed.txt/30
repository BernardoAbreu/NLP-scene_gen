<A>__{as soon as the boy starts to talk, we notice something in his mouth a tongue pierce. josie does too. we zoom in on that shiny little metal ball. josie is fixated. so fixated that we stop hearing the boy's voice. all we see is the mouth and that ball moving. the mouth closes. he's done. josie's face is contorted in imagined pain.}
