<L>__{interior local train day}
<A>__{anna clutches her red bag to her, sitting among passengers. anna looks about her. across the carriage she sees through the window that her train is overtaking another passenger train on the next line. she looks at the windows of the other train "going by" . . . seeing the pas sengers inside. unexpectedly, she seems to see a man who might be vronsky sitting opposite a laughing woman who might be princess sorokina. anna's body jerks involuntarily. she half rises. the image, however, is brief and is borne away, as her own train goes by, accelerating. the win dows opposite pick up speed as she leaves them behind and then she has the same illusion again a "vronsky" and a "sorokina" glimpsed in the other train and snatched away in the instant. now she stands up and goes to the opposite window, where the windows of the other train are flashing by in the (anachronistic) manner of pro jected film frames, and she sees "vronskys" and "sorokinas" flashing by at gathering speed. and then the train has gone and there's nothing going by but the view. anna collapses into the nearest seat.}
<L>__{exterior local station, same time day}
<A>__{the train arrives at a small station. anna steps down from the train. the platform is well populated by people waiting to board the train or to meet the arriving passengers. there is an energy about the people shouting, laughter, movement. porters shout for custom. a couple of young men seem to be laughing rudely directly at her, but they pass by, ignoring her. anna pauses, bewildered, lost, not knowing what to do nexterior she sees the sorokina coachman on the platform, recognising his distinctive livery, a cockade in his hat.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{are you waiting for the princess sorokina?}
<C>__{coachman}
<D>__{no, your excellency, both princesses are at the house of countess vronsky. i'm waiting for him }
<A>__{anna turns back, agitated, expecting vronsky to appear, but what comes is a footman carrying three hatboxes and a large box from a dress shop. anna walks away, along the platform, impeded by people going by her, aware that some are staring at her as she passes. a boy selling drinks grins at her. a little group of ladies and children meeting a bespectacled man off the train are laughing and chattering but fall silent and look at her. she increases her pace. she hurries away towards the far end of the platform. beyond her, a goods train is slowly approaching. between her and the train, two maidservants are walking towards her. they turn their heads to look at her, remarking on her dress.}
<C>__{maidservant}
<D>__{look at that lace on her . . .}
<A>__{there is a rough bench near the end of the platform. anna reaches it and sits down. the two girls turn again to look back at her, and are struck by the sight of anna sitting alone in profile. the goods train reaches her and the first wagon goes past her. the two girls stop and watch, vaguely puzzled by her. as they watch, the beautiful woman on the bench gets up and walks the few steps to the edge of the wooden platform and into the path of the train, disappearing from view between the wheels of one of the wagons.}

<D>__{well, you don't press people hard, but you live rightly, for your soul, not your belly.}

<D>__{you're a great one for reasoning, konstantin dmitrich, but what's rightly is outside your mathematic that's what's rightly about it!}
<A>__{this stops levin's scythe. he is illumined. theodore swings the scythe again. levin walks away, gives his scythe to a labourer by the cart, and keeps walking. he quickens his pace.}
