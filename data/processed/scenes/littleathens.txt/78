<L>__{exterior diner moments later}
<A>__{through the window we see patrons eating. pedro drives by in his tow truck with the mustang hitched to the back.}
<L>__{interior dr. cook's office, examining room day}
<A>__{heather is sitting on the examining table, topless, holding her breath as dr. cook runs a stethoscope on different areas of her back. heather's blouse and purse are lying on the examining table beside her.}
<C>__{dr. cook}
<D>__{breathe out.}
<A>__{heather lets her breath out.}
<C>__{dr. cook }
<D>__{it's official. you're as healthy as you were last week, and last week you were as healthy as an ox.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{are you sure you're using that thing right? i feel this ache}
<P>__{(indicating her chest)}
<D>__{right here, like i'm being crushed between two boards.}
<C>__{dr. cook}
<D>__{nobody's crushing you. honest. i'm sure. it's all in your head. i know a couple quacks...}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{i don't need a head doctor!}
<C>__{dr. cook}
<D>__{i was just kidding there.}
<A>__{heather reaches into her purse and lights a cigarette. dr. cook sighs they've had a discussion about heather's smoking before.}
<C>__{dr. cook }
<D>__{heather, if you're going to insist on ignoring my rules, at least put your blouse on before you light up.}
<A>__{heather hops off the bench and makes a sudden about face. she is gesturing wildly, seemingly oblivious to the fact that she is half naked.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{can't i be concerned about my health?! is that so outrageous?!}
<A>__{dr. cook is clearly uncomfortable conversing with heather while her breasts are exposed.}
<C>__{dr. cook}
<D>__{heather...}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{i just don't want to be walking around tomorrow and drop dead because my heart collapses, and so that makes me weird or paranoid...}
<C>__{dr. cook}
<D>__{heather, there's nothing wrong with being concerned about your health. please put your blouse back on.}
<A>__{heather grabs her blouse from the table and puts it back on.}
<C>__{dr. cook }
<D>__{so i will see you next week then.}
<C>__{heather}
<P>__{(suddenly friendly again)}
<D>__{okay, yeah, see you next week.}
<A>__{heather leaves and shuts the door behind her.}
