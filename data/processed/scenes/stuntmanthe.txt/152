<A>__{the pleasant seafood restaurant is on the pier over the water. cameron, now wearing sam's sweater after all, is searching about the crowded room trying to find nina and what might be her family. he is about to leave when he sees a group at a window table, a man and woman in their early fifties and a fourteen year old girl, attractive despite the baby fat. something about the composite of all their features is familiar enough to give them a second look. in doing so, he sees a half eaten birthday cake on their table, in front of an empty place. he goes to the table.}

<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{i was sort of invited to a birthday party and i can't seem to find it...and this seems to be a birthday party...}
<A>__{the father, a hearty, bluff, good natured man, looks at cameron amiably and with a father's intuition.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{a birthday party is a birthday party...sit down.}
<P>__{(cameron does)}
<D>__{who was this birthday party for... animal, vegetable or mineral?}
<A>__{nancy, the fourteen year old, giggles.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{...mineral.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{will you stop teasing this young man?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{she's really worth finding, ma'am. she's a very rare mineral.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(pleased with cameron)}
<D>__{how old is this mineral?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{this morning she was acting about ninety, but she might be lying a year or two.}
<A>__{the father now really comfortable, recognizing a fellow humorist.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{no, you got the wrong table...this one's acting like she's six...but the missus tells me birthdays are very emotional for the ladies.}
<A>__{at this moment cameron can tell from their faces that they've seen nina behind him. he turns.}
