<L>__{interior sam's apartment day}
<A>__{balloons and a banner reading "happy birthday, lucy!" for lucy's birthday, sam has rented a moon bounce which sits in the center of the apartment and filling the entire place leaving no room for the few kids and their parents. brad stands too close to a young attractive mother. robert shakes all the presents suspiciously.}
<C>__{sam}

<A>__{there's a knock at the door.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{is that lucy? annie's supposed to call and warn us. shhhh, everyone.}
<A>__{brad hits the lights. sam opens the door and everyone yells "surprise!" but instead of lucy, it's the social worker.}
<C>__{margaret brown}
<D>__{i don't know if you remember me. i'm margaret brown from children's social services. we met at the police station.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{put your present over there hurry up! lucy might be on her way.}
<P>__{(the phone rings)}
<D>__{hello? annie says she's coming up the stairs. everyone be quiet. assume surprise positions!}
<P>__{(conner keeps talking)}
<D>__{be quiet! assume surprise positions!}
<C>__{conner}

<A>__{conner's father hurls sam across the room sam gets tangled in the moon bounce! to get attention, conner bursts into tears. we hear footsteps outside the door brad hits the lights. we hear a crash! and in the light, the door sheds as it opens, lucy and ifty see that moonbounce, swaying. then from within the moonbounce:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{surprise! happy birthday!}
<A>__{lucy stands frozen, holding a red balloon.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{daddy?!}
<C>__{conner}
<D>__{you don't have to call him "daddy".}
<P>__{(in sam's face)}
<D>__{she says you're not her real father, anyway. she's adopted!}
<A>__{humiliated, lucy runs away! the social worker watches, profoundly concerned, and reaches for her cellular phone.}
