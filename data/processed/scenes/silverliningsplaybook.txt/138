<A>__{you think i fucked up the eagles' juju, don't you?}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{ever since, ever since he was with you, ever since }

<A>__{i'm the reason why today happened?}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{i think so.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{let's talk about that.}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{be my guest.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{the first night that pat and i met at my sister's, the eagles beat the forty niners handily, forty to twenty six. the second time we got together we went for a run and the phillies beat the dodgers seven to five in the nlcs.}
<C>__{jake}
<A>__{she's right, dad.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{the next time we went for a run the eagles beat the falcons, twenty seven to fourteen.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{wow.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{the third time we got together we had raisin bran in the diner and the phillies dominated tampa bay in the fourth game of the world series, ten to two.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{oh, wow.}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{let me think about that. wait a minute.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{well, why don't you think about when the eagles beat the seahawks, fourteen to seven.}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{he was with you?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{he was with me. we went for a run.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<A>__{really? that's crazy.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{there have been no games since pat and i have been rehearsing every day and if pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the eagles beat the new york giants.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{she's making a lot of sense, pop. that's all right on all counts.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of new york is on the official seal of the state of new york? huh? anybody? (to pat sr.) do you? do you know? "excelsior." look it up. yeah, "excelsior."}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{oh pat.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{not that i give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, i don't send the eagles guy whose personal motto is "excelsior," to a fucking giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{unbelievable.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{wow. how did you know all that stuff?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{i did my research.}
<B>__{she snaps off a beer bottle cap and drinks.}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<D>__{well, i gotta say, i'm impressed.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<D>__{i gotta rethink this whole thing. i didn't trust it before, but i gotta say, now i do.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{oh, now you like her, dad?}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{i have to say i do. yup.}
<C>__{randy}
<A>__{patrizio, i feel terrible, you know? you made the bet, i won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{oh, fuck off, randy. you love it. you live for this shit. you've been betting against my father for years.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{is that right?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{you're twisting the knife right now. you get off on it!}
<C>__{randy}
<A>__{that's bullshit! that's not true! don't say that!}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{you get off on it! if not, then prove it. prove it.}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{yeah, prove it, prove it!}
<C>__{randy}
<A>__{how do you want me to prove it?}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{how's he gonna prove it?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{by giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{no, no, no, no, no, no, no.}
<C>__{randy}
<A>__{double or nothing on the bengals, next week? is that what you're saying?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{no. she pauses, turns dramatically to randy.}
<C>__{tiffany }
<D>__{against the cowboys.}
<B>__{everyone gasps.}
<C>__{tiffany }
<D>__{that's your team isn't it, randy?}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{that's his team!}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{i know who his team is.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{when is the game?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{december twenty eight, last game of the season.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{same day as the benjamin franklin pairs open freestyle dance competition.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{oh god.}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<D>__{randy, i thought they were america's team. don't you believe in america's team?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{yeah, randy, don't you believe in america's team?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{yeah, i believe in america's team but if i win that bet, i win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing.}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<D>__{i like it.}
<C>__{dolores}
<D>__{no. no, patrizio }
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{i believe in the eagles, i believe in my son, i will take the action. i will take it.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{dad!}
<C>__{dolores}
<A>__{patrizio, don't! it's toxic!}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{i have faith, i have faith. excelsior belongs in this house }
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{dad }
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{ not in the state of new york. in this house.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{dad, listen to me. i didn't know that "excelsior" was the state motto of new york, okay?}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{i didn't know, either, but now i know.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{i know, but listen to me, this is toxic. dad, dad, dad, this is toxic, you shouldn't be doing this, you shouldn't be doing }
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{randy, what do you say (to pat) be quiet, shut up. you already did enough. (to randy) randy, what do you say? my birds, benjamin franklin's team favored by one and a half points. i will give you three more.}
<C>__{dolores}
<A>__{patrizio, stop it! and randy, don't you take the bet!}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{in fact, i will give you ten points.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{no, dad! dad!}
<C>__{jake}
<A>__{dad!}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{you have to take that bet on the cowboys.}
<C>__{randy}
<A>__{dolores, would you stop him?}
<C>__{jake}
<A>__{jesus!}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{how could you not take that bet? even with the ten points i give you, that's an insane spread to your advantage. cowboys are cowards. and i will bet you're such a coward, you won't take the ten. plus, are you listening, plus whatever their score is at the dance thing. (to tiffany) what's that? tiffany, what's that?}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{what? no, no, no, no.}
<C>__{randy}
<A>__{you're crazy to give away that many points. that's ridiculous! i won't take that! however, wait a second. i do like the idea of a parlay.}
<C>__{dolores}
<A>__{what? no parlay! no!}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{no, don't do it. don't do it.}
<C>__{randy}
<A>__{pat, how do they run this dance competition? i mean, how do they score it and everything?}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{i don't know, i don't know how they fucking score! we're participating. we're not, we're not a part of it. there are people, this is a high end dance contest. i don't know. do not put it as part of the parlay, randy. don't }
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{they go by the philadelphia rules. each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. you have to average the four judges' scores.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{okay, score is from one to ten, right? and you guys are how good?}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{we suck.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{we don't suck. pat's a beginner, i'm okay, we're happy just to be going there.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{and how are the people you're competing against?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{they're good. some of them are professionals.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{they're good? better than you?}
<A>__{pause. tiffany says nothing.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{a lot better.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{a lot better. so if i was to say you only have to score five, i would be really very generous, right?}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{no, no, that would be amazing if we got five. let's not get away }
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! gimme a break! gimme me a break!}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{we can't get five!}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<D>__{give `em a five. give `em a five.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{we can do a five.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{what are you talking about, dad? you haven't even seen us dance!}
<C>__{randy}
<A>__{that's the parlay.}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<A>__{will somebody please explain to me the parlay? please?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<A>__{you gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing. for pat sr. to win, the birds gotta beat the cowboys plus pat and tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance.}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<A>__{that's very, very manic indeed.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<A>__{that's the parlay.}
<C>__{randy}
<A>__{shake on it.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{you know what? i'm not gonna be a part of this. (to randy) randy, randy, you're a sickness. you're a fucking sickness, randy. i'm out.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{pat, you can't quit.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{i'm not doing the dance. i'm out.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{pat, calm down. thank about it.}
<C>__{pat}
<A>__{see you later.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{pat, no.}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<A>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<A>__{pat.}
<C>__{pat}
<P>__{(walking out)}
<D>__{i'm out.}
<C>__{pat sr.}
<P>__{(follows him)}
<D>__{here we are again at the one yard line. desean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. there you go.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{what does that even mean, dad? i'm not gonna make that, that, that connection that you're making with desean jackson. it doesn't matter anymore okay? just because i have the fucking jersey on...i'm not gonna do it. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{you are not a stand up guy right now. if it's me reading the signs...if it's me reading the signs }
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{if it's you reading the signs? you're reading the signs? oh, okay.}
<B>__{pat steps through the doorway}
<C>__{dolores}
