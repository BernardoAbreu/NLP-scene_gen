<L>__{exterior pipeline day}
<A>__{from on high we follow the snaking pipeline ... until it disappears in a vast, smouldering bomb crater. beyond, the pipeline continues unperturbed. two tiny figures on the banks of the crater.}
<B>__{close on them}
<A>__{bond and christmas, very much alive. she's angry.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{what the hell were you doing? you nearly killed us!}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i did kill us. she thinks we're dead. and she thinks she got away with it.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{what the hell are you talking about?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{it's part of some plan. she dresses it up like a terrorist attack. the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{who's she?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{elektra king.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{elektra king? are you insane? this is her pipeline.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{makes her look even more innocent.}
<C>__{christmas}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{what would she want with weapons grade plutonium?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i was hoping you could tell me.}
<A>__{christmas stares at him. wheels turning.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{you steal an old bomb, small by today's standards, about the size of the one that destroyed nagasaki, take the plutonium core out of it, intending to use it...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{to make a bigger, better bomb.}
<A>__{they're both chilled by the thought.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{i have to get after that core. this is my ass.}
<A>__{she starts fiddling with the radio. suddenly there's a}
<B>__{crackle.}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{tanner to 007, do you read?}
<A>__{bond grabs the radio.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{loud and clear. i have to speak to m.}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{she's gone.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{she's disappeared. and two of our men have been killed.}
<A>__{it impacts on bond. his eyes harden.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{she just upped the stakes. all her chips are on the table now. and m's life is part of the bet.}
<A>__{he looks out at the long stretch of pipeline, like a deadly snake with the world for its bed.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i know i promised you champagne, but would you settle for caviar?}
