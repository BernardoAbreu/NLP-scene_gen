<L>__{interior mill grove high school gymnasium night}
<A>__{charlie and mary elizabeth slow dance to an 80's love song. sweaty palms. awkward. hands on hips. horror. charlie looks around the gym. he sees alice dancing with her date, an effeminate goth kid (17). we'll never meet him, but he'll make us laugh once. charlie then watches patrick dance with sam. he follows patrick's gaze across the floor to brad, who dances with a senior girl (18). charlie sees the boys look at each other. for one moment, it's like they're dancing together.}
