<L>__{exterior railroad tracks smith, coley and pete}
<A>__{in b.g. at a respectful distance are hector, sam and hastings. shoot parallel to tracks, which disappear far into the horizon. the following dialogue is delivered in an undertone...}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(turning to coley)}
<D>__{now, coley...?}
<C>__{coley}
<P>__{(takes a breath, then)}
<D>__{i think macreedy's a nothing. a nobody.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{is he?}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{so there's nothing to worry about.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{isn't there?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you got brains, you have.}
<C>__{coley}
<P>__{(squirming)}
<D>__{but what can he find out? that komako was...?}
<P>__{(smith glares at him)}
<D>__{suppose he finds out?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{a nobody like macreedy can raise a pretty big stink. the point is... who would miss a nobody like macreedy if he just, say, disappeared? who, coley?}
<A>__{coley is terribly preoccupied, balances himself, like a child, on a steel rail.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{coley!}
<C>__{coley}
<P>__{(galvanized from the rail)}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{why don't we wait...}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{wait for what?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i mean, maybe he won't find anything. maybe he'll just go away.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{not macreedy. i know those maimed guys. their minds get twisted. they put on hair shirts and act like martyrs. they're all of 'em do gooders, trouble makers, freaks.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{but there's no danger yet. let's wait and see.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(interrupting,}
<D>__{appealing to coley}
<P>__{as an equal)}
<D>__{no danger, he says. this guy's like a carrier of small pox. since he arrives, there's been a fever in this town, an infection. and it's spreading.}
<P>__{(he glances from coley to pete)}
<D>__{hastings has been in a sick sweat, running around, shooting off his face. doc, for the first time in four years, gets snotty with me. liz...}
<P>__{(to pete)}
<D>__{...your own sister acts like a fool.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(hotly)}
<D>__{she's just a kid.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(scoffing)}
<D>__{kid! she must have strained every muscle in her head to get so stupid! renting him a jeep! and tim tim, the rum dum. tim suddenly decides he's gotta act like a sheriff.}
<P>__{(to coley, gesturing at pete)}
<D>__{and he says what's the danger.}
<A>__{brittle silence for a moment. then...}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(easily)}
<D>__{of course, if you want to take the chance...}
<A>__{pete doesn't answer.}
<C>__{coley}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{not me.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{all right, then...}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{it's not all right! you're so mighty quick to kill he's not an animal!}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(to coley, with mock surprise)}
<D>__{well, listen to little spitfire...}
<P>__{(turning slowly on pete)}
<D>__{you sniveling toad! i'm saving your neck! if i don't, who will?}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(squirming)}
<D>__{all i said...}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{who will?! doc? tim? your sister, with the rocks in her head?}
<A>__{pete is silent.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{one thing about your sister she's got twice the guts you have. you're only fit for running away.}
<C>__{coley}
<D>__{it's too late for that.}
<P>__{(belligerently, slowly, at pete)}
<D>__{he's in this, and he ain't running no place.}
<A>__{there is a long, electric silence. pete is defeated.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{all right, then...}
<A>__{he pauses for emphasis. then, as he starts to talk again...}
