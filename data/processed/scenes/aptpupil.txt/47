<L>__{interior dussander's bedroom night}
<A>__{the bedroom is dark except for the glowing tip of a cigarette. dussander is in bed, wide awake...}
<L>__{interior dussander's kitchen day}
<A>__{title: january 1985 todd sits alone at the table, eating while he studies. dussander crosses the frame behind him, drink in hand. todd is noticeably annoyed by dussander's presence.}
<L>__{exterior bike path tunnel dusk}
<A>__{it is raining. todd is riding fast. he wears a raincoat with the hood up. he talks to himself loudly, but we can't make out what he is saying. he enters the tunnel. the muddy run off inside the tunnel catches todd by surprise. he loses control of the bike and falls into the mud.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{fuck.}
<A>__{todd gets up and tries to free his bike, but the mud and water do not make the job easy. he is almost finished when a gruff voice catches his attention.}
<C>__{archie }
<D>__{hey, kid, you having some trouble?}
<A>__{todd looks up and sees a figure moving toward him in the shadows of the tunnel. todd quickly pulls out a pocket knife. he flicks open the blade and hides it behind his leg.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no. i got it... thanks.}
<A>__{the figure steps closer. the light catches his face to reveal archie. he is an unshaven, filthy mess, and when he speaks his words are slurred from years of steady drinking.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{that case maybe you could loan me a dollar. help out a vietnam vet? how 'bout it?}
<A>__{todd eyes the man cautiously. he looks around. no one is nearby. the constant din of the rain echoes within the confines of the tunnel.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i... i don't know... i don't think so.}
<A>__{todd palms the knife out of sight and slowly approaches the bum.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{c'mon, you got something for me. i know you do.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{well, maybe... i have to check.}
<A>__{todd's hands go into his pockets. he stops a few feet from the bum.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{see, i got to get up to l.a. got a job waiting for me up there.}
<A>__{todd moves closer. close enough to touch the bum.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i thought i did have a couple of quarters...}
<A>__{the bum looks at him hopefully. todd looks back at him, sizing him up, really noticing him for the first time.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{you know,}
<P>__{(his voice drops)}
<D>__{for a dollar i will give you a blow job. take you right up there where it's still dry. you never had so good, kid. you'll come your brains out.}
<A>__{todd freezes for a moment. the bum is right in his face. suddenly todd throws a handful of change at the bum and sprints back to his bike. he hops on and is gone in a flash, leaving the bum there to pick up the scattered coins. as todd zips away, the hood is off his head. the rain begins to beat away the splattered mud from his face.}
