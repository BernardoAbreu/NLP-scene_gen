<L>__{interior warehouse moments later}
<A>__{romeo's winging it, jerky moves, grinding gears as the forklift staggers across the mammoth warehouse toward the gangsters at the opposing end. the crate blocks romeo from view. he's driving blind as the rickety crate jiggles on the forks. inside crate: connor and murphy are sardined, back to back.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{jesus! what the fuck's he doin'?!}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{he can't see where he's goin'!}
<A>__{murphy peaks through a crack.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{shit! tell him to go left, now!}
<A>__{connor puts his mouth to a knot hole.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{go left! go left!}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{connor sticks his finger out the hole and points. romeo wrenches the wheel and they narrowly avoid machinery. the crate rocks...}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i can't fuckin' believe i let you talk me into this! this is a stupid plan!}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{i didn't notice you throwin' out any ideas, ya creative asshole!}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{the boys start elbowing each other in a close quarters scrap while hurling obscenities.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{hey! what's goin' on in there?!}
<A>__{inside crate: murphy suddenly stops, eyes wide as he looks through the crack. they are headed for a "mechanic's well." a long, rectangular cement hole in the floor six feet deep.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{jesus christ! tell him to stop!}
<A>__{connor slams his mouth to the knot hole.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{brakes! brakes! brakes!}
<A>__{a few of the chinese turn as romeo slams on the brakes, screeching to a halt just before the well. the crate slides right off and falls in, disappears from sight. crash! a large cloud of coffee dust plumes. a wide eyed romeo is exposed. the asian gangsters stare in shock. hard techno music! suddenly, romeo whips it in reverse, cranks the wheel guns it and navigates the well. speeds toward the gangsters. mechanic's well: (slo mo) the brothers burst from the debris, covered in coffee grounds and white powder. they draw their weapons and walk toward the ramp at the well's opposing end. the chinese pull and start firing. romeo dives off and rolls behind some machines. the lift continues on target. the brothers emerge and tear right in, firing at the gangsters. romeo fires his useless 22. in the ensuing fire fight the brothers kill all but chinese gangster #3. the forklift crashes through the table with the stacked heroin. slo mo: the brothers slam the final gangster to his knees and level to the back of his head and recite the following in synchronicity...}
<C>__{brothers}
<D>__{and shepherds we shall be, for thee, my lord, for thee. power hath descended forth from thy hand, that our feet may swiftly carry out thy command. so, we shall flow a river forth to thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be.}
<C>__{brothers }
<D>__{in nomine patris, et filii, et spiritus sancti.}
<A>__{pop! pop! they kill him. dip to black...}
