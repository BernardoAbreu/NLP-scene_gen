<A>__{anderson stands on a street corner waiting in line with several people waiting for the n0.6 turbo tram. the double decker tram comes. people get off, then the line starts to move forward as people get on. anderson fidgets. he's last in line. each person gets identiscanned as he boards. anderson's putting his new eyes to the test. if the scan goes wrong, he's positioned himself to run. the woman ahead of him, gets scanned, pays her fare. anderson's turn. anderson goes up the steps, and a red beam reads his eyes. the tram driver glances at a monitor beside his steering wheel, then nods at him.}
