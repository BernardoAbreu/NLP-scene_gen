<L>__{interior tom's private office full shot}
<A>__{as tom follows helen inside and closes the door. he turns to her, his voice tense with excitement.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i've got some terrific news about your friend, mr. carpenter.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(trying to appear calm)}
<D>__{what about him?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{helen, he's the man from the space ship!}
<P>__{(she eyes him evenly,}
<D>__{apprehensively, as}
<P>__{he hurries on)}
<D>__{i had that diamond checked at three different places. nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! after what bobby told us, that's enough for me. why is it nobody knows anything about him? why hasn't he got any money?}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(evenly, with quiet tension)}
<D>__{all right, tom it's true. i know it's true.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{never mind about that.}
<P>__{(urgently, with great concern)}
<D>__{you've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{are you crazy? after what happened today?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you don't understand. you don't realize how important it is.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{important? of course it's important. the point is we can do something about it.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that's what i'm trying to tell you. we mustn't do anything about it. believe me, tom, i know what i'm talking about.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(irritated by her opposition)}
<D>__{he's a menace to the whole world! it's our duty to turn him in.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{but he isn't a menace! he told me what he came here for.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(dismissing this with annoyed contempt)}
<D>__{he told you... don't be silly, honey just because you like the guy.}
<P>__{(busy with his own thoughts)}
<D>__{you realize what this'd mean for us? i'd be the biggest man in the country. i could write my own ticket.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(eyeing him coldly)}
<D>__{is that what you're thinking about?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(guiltily, defensive)}
<D>__{why not? somebody's got to get rid of him.}
<A>__{they are interrupted by the sharp sound of the interoffice buzzer.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm not going to let you do it, tom.}
<P>__{(with deep personal urgency)}
<D>__{believe me, this is literally the most important thing in the world.}
<A>__{tom picks up the phone and answers it.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yes?... what's his name, margaret? general cutler?}
<P>__{(disappointed that}
<D>__{the connection isn't}
<P>__{completed)}
<D>__{all right, i will hold on.}
<A>__{realizing what he's doing, helen crosses to him, pleading wildly, desperately.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{tom, you mustn't ! you don't know what you're doing! it isn't just you and mr. carpenter. the rest of the world, is involved!}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{i don't care about the rest of the world!}
<A>__{it is as though he had slapped her across the face. suddenly he has revealed himself, naked and distasteful. feeling guilty as he sees the contempt and revulsion in her eyes, he tries the old charm, holding his hand over the phone.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(staring at him starkly)}
<D>__{i feel different right now.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(uneasily)}
<D>__{you wait and see. you're going to marry a big hero!}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm not going to marry anybody.}
<A>__{she turns and runs quickly out of the room. tom's inclination is to follow her, when his connection is completed.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hello, general cutler?}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{no, i don't want to speak to his aide. i want to speak to the general. tell him it's about the space man... my name is tom stevens. s t e v e n s.}
