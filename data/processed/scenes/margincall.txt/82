<L>__{interior trading floor hallway day}
<A>__{he heads down the hallway and passes the heather and lauren bratberg from the opening scene who are returning with boxes to lay off more people. sam heads off towards the elevator.}
<L>__{interior senior executive dining room moments later}
<A>__{the room has ten tables formally set that line a long wall of floor to ceiling windows with a commanding view of the city beyond. the room is empty except for john tuld sitting at the last table. tuld looks a little surprised to see sam but waves him down. sam approaches.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{sam, please sit. congratulations are clearly in order.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{our guys did what they could.}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{you did a hell of a job today, and i thank you for it. sit, excuse me for eating but it's been a long day. can i get you anything?}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{no, no thanks.}
<A>__{they just sit in silence for a long beat as tuld takes a few more bites of his meal.}
<C>__{tuld}
<D>__{so what can i do for you?}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{i want out.}
<C>__{tuld}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{i'm done, i want out.}
<C>__{tuld}
<D>__{it's been a very difficult day, for everyone.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{i need you to release my options, that is if they're still worth anything after today, and i need the bonus. i'm out.}
<C>__{tuld}
<D>__{you'll get the bonus, the options, and keep your current base, but i need you to stay with me for another 24 months. o.k?}
<A>__{they look at each other, sam seems to know it's not actually a question. sam is a shell of himself as tuld takes another hearty bite of his meal. he finally looks up.}
<C>__{tuld }
<D>__{for god's sake man put a smile on your face, you did some good today, you said so yourself. i'm starting to feel a little better about this whole thing. you're one of the luckiest guys in the world, you could've been digging ditches all these years...}
<A>__{sam pushes back his chair, stands, and prepares to leave.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{that's true, and if i had been at least there'd be some holes in the ground to show for it. i'm just not quite sure how we fucked this thing up so badly.}
<A>__{this pushes tuld a bit too far. he also senses he may be losing sam. he drops his fork, and his tone changes.}
<C>__{tuld}
<D>__{jesus, when did you start feeling so sorry for yourself, it's unbearable... what, you think we may have helped put some people out of business today? that it's all just for naught? well you've been doing that everyday for almost forty years sam. and if all this is for naught then so is everything else out there. it's just money, it's made up, a piece of paper with some pictures on it so we don't all kill each other trying to get something to eat. but it's not wrong and it's certainly not any different today than it's ever been. ever. 1637, 1797, 1819, `37, `57,`84, 1901, `07, 1929, `37, `73, and 1987... god damn did that motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97, 2000, and whatever this is gonna be called. they're just the same thing over and over. we can't help ourselves, and you and i can't control it, stop it, slow it, or even ever so slightly alter it... we just react... and we get paid well for it if we're right... and get left by the side of the road if we're wrong. there's always been and there's always gonna be the same percentage of winners and losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat pigs and starving dogs in this world... yes there may be more of us today... but the percentages... they always stay exactly the same.}
<A>__{they stare at each other for a long beat and then tuld looks down and takes another bite. he chews. he looks up again.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{i will do it john, but not because of your little speech, but because i need the money. i'm not sure how it could possibly be after all these years, but i need the money.}
<A>__{they both look at each other again, then look over and see jared cohen walking down the dining room aisle with peter sullivan next to him.}
<C>__{sam rogers }
<D>__{you're keeping the kid?}
<C>__{john tuld}
<D>__{keeping him? he's getting promoted. it's all hands on deck now sam, there's going to be a lot of money to be made coming out of this mess, we're going to need all the brains we can get around here.}
<A>__{they look at each other one last time then sam starts walking away and as he passes peter he just gives him a slight nod.}
