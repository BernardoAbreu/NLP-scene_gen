<D>__{remember, parents don't want photos where their child isn't smiling. some children may not want to smile. it is your job to coax a smile out of them. a good line to remember is: "santa thinks everybody should be happy. can you smile for santa?" a camera can only copy a child's smile it will take you to put it there.}
