<B>__{voice.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{listen lee, i don't even mind if it was him. you could just talk to him and that would be enough for me... see it was kind of strange finding the crops like that. the kids were... confused by it. it would take the strangeness away if we knew it was lionel and the wolfington brothers just messing around...}
<P>__{(beat, listens)}
<D>__{the movies...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<P>__{(beat)}

<D>__{houdini peed. i think he's sick.}
<A>__{graham looks at the majestic dog. it's shivering.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{take him outside. i will call dr. reynolds.}
<A>__{morgan and bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on their faces. graham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the puddle of urine. the doorbell rings with graham still on his knees on the kitchen floor. he leans back so he can see down the hall. a balding police officer stands on the other side of the screen door.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{that was quick edgar. i only called you boys about two hours ago.}
<A>__{officer edgar paski nods that he knows.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{mrs. kindleman twisted her ankle as she put it, "diving for her life" when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards. she went down to thorton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards. spitting! by the time i got there, mrs. kindleman had sprayed the whole damn place... she must have had a cold or something. it was enough to turn a grown man's stomach.}
<A>__{beat. graham stares at officer paski.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{so what happened to your crops?}
