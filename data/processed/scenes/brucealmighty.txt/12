<L>__{exterior parking lot day}
<A>__{bruce screeches into a space, races out of the car, bumping over a trash can, goes back to pick it up, sees a homeless man who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket and sign boards. the various "warnings" change daily. today's sign reads:}
<D>__{r ewe blind?}
<A>__{bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then continues on.}
