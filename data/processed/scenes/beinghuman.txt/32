<L>__{exterior courtyard morning}
<A>__{the slaves gather on one side of the courtyard, gossiping and playing games of chance on the ground. their masters wait on the other side of the courtyard, seated on benches along the wall. cyprian's aides usher the visitors into his presence in a regular flow, some have an audience of a few minutes, others last merely seconds. hector keeps an eye on lucinnius, like a mother watching her child from a distance on its first day at school. lucinnius, sitting expectantly in line, does look a little pathetic, even ridiculous. straight backed, hands on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri ficial offering himself. hector plays a game of five stone with some other slaves as he watches lucinnius shuffling up the bench place by place to the front of the line. we almost expect hector to give him a little wave of encouragement as he is finally summoned into the inner office. hector waits. the first signs seem good. lucinnius doesn't emerge within the first minute. cyprian is at least giving him the time of day. more minutes pass. hector watches a game of handball while keeping an eye on the office door. one or two others, familiar to us from the bathhouse, go into the office. so does lucinnius' friend julian. eventually lucinnius emerges into the sunlight, a broad smile on his face. hector relaxes and leaves the ball game to join him.}

<D>__{relieved anyway... relieved that it's over at last.}
