<L>__{interior morgue day}
<A>__{kay races into the morgue just as the examination table explodes into the air, revealing edgar, who was hiding beneath it. now everything happens at once. jay leaps back and draws the noisy cricket, kay pulls out his series four deatomizer, and edgar holds his shotgun under laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{freeze it, bug!}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{don't shoot! don't shoot!}
<C>__{laurel}
<P>__{(to jay)}
<D>__{christ, are you thick!}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{how was i supposed to know!?!}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{what did i have to do, sing it for you!?!}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{maybe if you didn't come on like a drunken prom date!}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{oh, that's so typical. any time a woman shows the slightest hint of sexual independence, men just }
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{everybody shut up!}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{let her go, shit eater.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{listen, monkey boy, i may have to take that kind of talk in my end of the universe, but compared to you humans, i'm the top rung on the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all right?!}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{you're breakin' my heart. move six inches to your left and i will solve all your problems.}
<A>__{orion the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and landing on edgar, hissing and scratching and clawing for all she's worth. edgar snaps an arm up and whips her off. the cat squirms in his arm, the icon jangling. edgar grabs the icon, holds onto it, and flings the cat away, across the morgue. the icon comes free, remaining in his hand. he drops it into his mouth and swallows. he shoves the gun hard against laurel's cheek.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{that's better. now put down your weapons. we're leaving.}
<A>__{kay freezes, teeth clenched, gun still in front of him. standoff.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{have you ever pulled the wings off a fly?}
<A>__{edgar cranks one of laurel's arms behind her back, hard, and she cries out in pain.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{would you care to see the fly get even?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{how far you think you'll get without your ship? if that's what you call that hunk of space crap we've got back at our office.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{put the weapons down!}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{never gonna happen, insect.}
<A>__{edgar backs away with laurel, further into the morgue, toward a glass window that looks out at the base of an air shaft. jay and kay advance, slowly, cornering him.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{it's okay, laurel!}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{how is it okay?!}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i mean it's going to be okay!}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{don't bet on it, meat sack.}
<A>__{and with that he turns, leaps and crashes right through the window, into the air shaft.}
