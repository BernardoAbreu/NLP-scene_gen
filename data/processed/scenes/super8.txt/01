<A>__{shiny black loafers. black pants, three inches too long. we boom up, stopping at a boy's hand reaching into the black suit jacket pocket. pulls out a woman's gold necklace with a locket. he holds the locket. rubs it gently with his thumb. continue to boom up. we now see the boy's face. this is joe lamb, 14. on the precarious edge of adulthood. he looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes. he moves forward and we pan, so we're behind him now. in the frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest homes, is a steel mill. smokestacks and structures. the lifeblood of this late 70's town.}
