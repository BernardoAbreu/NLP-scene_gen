<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i'm just helping throw the shower.}
<C>__{stationery proprietess}
<D>__{oh. what's the party going to be like? sometimes it helps to know that before you pick an invitation.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{nothing special. just hors d'oeuvres and wine.}
<A>__{carl, meanwhile, is looking through the book of invitations.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{look at this bridal bingo. what's bridal bingo?}
<C>__{stationery proprietess}
<D>__{it's bingo, except you yell out embarrassing facts about the bride and whoever fills their card first wins.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{that sounds fun.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i'm not doing bridal bingo.}
<C>__{carl}

<D>__{that's kind of cute.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i think that's really cute.}
<A>__{carl's starting to get really into it. he turns the page and sees an invitation decorated with animals labeled "knights in white armor."}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{look at this one "knights in white armor."}
<C>__{stationery proprietess}
<D>__{the bride and groom ride in on a white stallion.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you have got to do that. like it's not even a choice.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{that seems a little extreme.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you only get married once.}
<C>__{stationery proprietess}
<D>__{your friend happens to be right.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{you're really good at this. you mind helping me with the wedding invitations?}
