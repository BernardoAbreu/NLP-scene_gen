<B>__{flare to white}
<T>__{fade in from white:}
<A>__{slowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image: white particles wave over a white background. a snowfall. a car bursts through the curtain of snow. the car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car, a brand new light brown cutlass ciera with the pink sales sticker showing in its rear window. as the car roars past, leaving snow swirling in their dirft, the title of the film fades in.}

<A>__{green highway signs point the way to moorehead, minnesota fargo, north dakota. the roads for the two cities diverge. a sign says welcome to north dakota and another just after says now entering fargo, nd, pop. 44,412. the car pulls into a rodeway inn.}
