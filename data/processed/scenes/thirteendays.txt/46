<L>__{exterior field table missile site, cuba day}
<A>__{schematics slapped down on a camp table. a group of soviet site engineers point and gesture as they study their ground from a shaded hillock. clearing crews and surveyors work and sweat in the distance.}
<C>__{general taylor }
<D>__{gmaic estimates ten to fourteen days. however, a crash program to ready the missiles could cut that time.}
<L>__{interior cabinet room day}
<A>__{taylor sees the grim looks all around.}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{i have to stress that there may be more missiles that we don't know about. we need more u 2 coverage.}
<A>__{kenny lets out his breath. he catches bobby's eye. this is unbelievable.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{is there any indication anything at all that suggests they intend to use these missiles in some sort of first strike?}
<C>__{general carter}
<D>__{not at present, sir. but i think the prudent answer is we don't know.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{do we have any sort of intelligence from cia on what khruschev is thinking?}
<C>__{general carter}
<D>__{no, mr. president. we don't. we just don't know what's happening inside the kremlin at that level.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{they lied to us. two weeks ago dobrynin told me to my face khurschev had no intention of putting missiles into cuba. they said themselves, this is our backyard.}
<A>__{there's angry agreement. the president cuts it off.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{gentlemen, i want first reactions. assuming for a moment khruschev has not gone off the deep end and intends to start world war three, what are we looking at?}
<A>__{rusk glances to his team at the end of the table. ball, johnson, martin, thompson and stevenson.}
<C>__{rusk}
<D>__{mr. president, i believe my team is in agreement. if we permit the introduction of nuclear missiles to a soviet satellite nation in our hemisphere, the diplomatic consequences will be too terrible to contemplate. the russians are trying to show the world they can do whatever they want, wherever they want, and we're powerless to stop them. if they succeed...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{it will be munich all over again.}
<C>__{rusk}
<D>__{appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive. confidence in our security commitments around the world will falter, allies will become unsure in the face of soviet pressure, and the soviets will be emboldened to push us even harder. we must remove the missiles one way or another. it seems to me the options are either to build up the crisis 'til they give in, or we hit them. an air strike.}
<A>__{there's silence at the table. some nods. understanding.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{bob?}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{we've worked up several military scenarios. before i ask general taylor to lead us through the various options, i'd like for us to adopt a rule. if we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. because once they are, i don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.}
<A>__{and there it is. the clock is running.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{sir. we need to consider... if we decide to act, there's a good chance we'll end up in a general war.}
<A>__{the room falls silent. the president leans back in his chair, studying the circle of men around the table, weighing them. kenny and the others watch him in silence. a long, dramatic pause. a course that will change history is about to be chosen. the president leans forward, folds his hands on the table. fated. grave.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{it's clear we cannot permit soviet nuclear missiles in cuba. we must get those missiles out.}
