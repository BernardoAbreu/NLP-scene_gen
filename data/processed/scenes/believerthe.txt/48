<D>__{...the man was afraid to let us hide on his farm any longer, but he agreed to take us to a more remote place. on the way he was stopped at a checkpoint, and when the soldiers found us in the hay, one of them grabbed my son out of my arms. he began to cry, so i reached for him, not to take him back, simply...}
<A>__{the man: mid 70s, tall, stooped, a crushed spirit.}
<C>__{polish man}
<D>__{...simply to assure him i was there. but the sergeant became enraged.... he stuck his bayonet in my son's chest, and lifted him up, impaled on it. my son was three years old....}
<A>__{billings is muttering, "what a load of crap..." the hate counselor looks over sharply. the other nazis are stunned by the story. danny can barely contain himself, though we are not sure why.}
<C>__{polish man}
<D>__{...he held him up so that the blood spurting out of him feel on my face.... the soldiers were laughing.}
<A>__{flashcut: exterior a country road day a horse hitched to a hay wagon; farmer driving. three nazi soldiers have discovered a jewish family hiding in the hay. a sergeant is holding up something unseen on the end of his rifle. the polish man who has been telling the story looks up at whatever it is. blood falls on him. the nazis are laughing.}

<D>__{what could he have done?? you fucking kikes...}
<C>__{hate counselor}
<D>__{you can't say that....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{the nazi's killing his kid. he could've jumped the guy. he could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... what would you have done if they were killing your son?}
<A>__{the counselor is briefly confused....}
<D>__{rumanian woman & others ...they'd have shot him on the spot.... he would have been dead in two seconds.... who are you judge?}

<D>__{don't listen to them, danny. it's all a bunch of crap.}
<C>__{ancient jew}
<D>__{what is crap?}

<D>__{the so called holocaust. it never happened. it's the hoax of the twentieth century.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(disgusted with this idiocy)}
<D>__{oh, please...}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{danny, it's true. there were no six million. at most, two hundred thousand jews died in the camps. and the majority of them were from disease and }
<A>__{the jews are shouting about historical records, the disappearance of families, whole towns.... but danny is louder:}

<C>__{ancient jew}
