<L>__{exterior desert valley day}
<A>__{the high desert absolutely silent a vast, hard land scape stretching away to distant mountains. the silence is broken by hoof beats.}
<L>__{exterior edgar's place day}
<A>__{it's a simple cabin dwarfed by a big, ramshackle barn. edgar deems (60s), a weathered desert rat of a hermit, is walking his donkey around in circles. now, rattling toward them down an endless dirt road, comes an old, sun bleached buick. it stops and out leans old fred (70s) wearing a sweat stained fedora. the two friends nod.}
<C>__{old fred}
<D>__{how's she doing?}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{she wants to lay down. i'm a little worried.}
<A>__{old fred climbs out with a bushel basket of carrots.}
<C>__{old fred}
<D>__{well, i brung her something i know she likes.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{damn, fred, you can't give away all those.}
<C>__{old fred}
<D>__{forget it. i got vegetables coming out my ears. usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately i ain't so much as seen a gopher or a jack rabbit nowheres.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{if that ain't the truth. and i count on them for a little bit of stew meat...thank you, fred.}
<A>__{edgar takes the carrots and feeds one to the donkey.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{here you go, justine. look what fred brought you.}
<C>__{old fred}
<D>__{we playing cards tonight?}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{i think i'm gonna be sitting up with her.}
<C>__{old fred}
<D>__{i'd do the same. well, catch you thursday.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{you bet.}
<A>__{the men nod, and old fred drives off. close up of the donkey's hooves thumping along as edgar leads her to the barn.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{let's get you out of the sun for a spell.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{i will get you some fresh water.}
<A>__{but, suddenly, we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its hooves and braying. edgar turns, concerned. now we hear an odd sound. distant thunder? the wind? the donkey gets more and more frantic. the barn shudders violently. frightened birds explode from the eaves. dust puffs from every old seam. roof shingles rain down. edgar stares in amazement.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{...some kind of earthquake !?}
<A>__{then another sound the donkey starts screeching in wild panic.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{justine, hang on! i'm coming!}
<A>__{edgar races back to the barn and flings open the doors.}
<L>__{interior edgar's barn day}
<A>__{dust swirls through the air. but the barn in empty. no donkey. now edgar is hit by a ghastly stench. he staggers back, and covers his nose with a handkerchief. then he sees, splattered across the walls blood !}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{what in the name of jehovah...?}
<A>__{he raises his arms above the door frame. when he lowers them he's holding a 12 gauge shotgun. he races outside, ready to shoot, but there's nothing as far as the eye can see.}
<L>__{exterior cliffs dawn}
<A>__{the sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge 1000 feet from a ruggedly beautiful high desert plateau. at the top of the cliffs, silhouetted against the dawn, a lone cow boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise. as we move in, we realize he's actually peeing over the cliff. this is valentine mckee (25). smart and good looking, val has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly. he coasts through life, following the path of least resistance which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on the edge of civilization. but lately he's beginning to wonder why he hasn't accomplished more in his 25 years. as a few sleepy cows gaze at him, sleepy val shuffles over to his battered old pickup truck. a hand painted sign on the door reads: "v & e all type's of job's." indeed, the pick up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every conceivable odd job and the noisily snoring form of his partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag. val raps on the side of the truck.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{good morning, mr. bassett, this is your wake up call. please move your fat ass.}
<A>__{no response from the sleeping bag. val stares at the cows chewing their cud and perks up as he gets an idea. he gently steps onto the truck's running board, then suddenly starts jumping up and down as hard as he can, rocking the truck violently.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{stampede! earl, get out of the way!}
<A>__{the sleeping bag tries to get up and run for it. it tumbles out of the back of the pickup. while val laughs uproar iously, earl basset (43) claws his way out of the bag, looks around wildly, and finds himself staring at three motionless cows.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you dumb shit.}
<A>__{earl is a good ol' boy who has lived his life just like val, drifting from job to job. he knows why he hasn't accom plished anything, and often tries to impart his hard won wisdom to val, but the last thing the younger man wants is advice. earl stretches. the men begin a silent ritual: earl gropes through his pockets for a cigarette, but only finds a lighter. meanwhile, val digs in his pockets, coming up with cigarettes, but no lighter. typical of these two, each guy always has half of what he needs. eventually they sort it out, trading the necessary implements. earl reaches for a coffee pot on a battered coleman stove on the tailgate. but it's cold.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you didn't cook breakfast?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{did it yesterday. franks and beans.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(tries to recall)}
<D>__{no...it was eggs. i did eggs.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{hell you did. your turn.}
<A>__{earl raises his fist. this is the challenge, and it instantly triggers the partners' conflict resolution technique. they solve all disputes using the children's game of "scissors, rock, paper." earl raises his fist in response. the game is played swiftly and silently one, two, three. on three, val mimes "paper" (open hand. earl mimes "scissors" (two extended fingers). scissors cuts paper. val has lost. he shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{well, when i'm your age i will probably forget what i eat, too.}
<L>__{exterior desert valley fence day}
<A>__{val and earl are restringing a dilapidated, and seemingly endless, barbed wire fence. a few bored cows watch them.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{how many cows does it take to make a stampede? is it like three or more? is there a minimum speed?}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{i was in one. a bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree. three hundred head going hell bent for the horizon. wasn't so damn funny, i can tell you.}
<A>__{earl's hand slips and the fence snags him right through his thick glove.}
<C>__{earl }
<D>__{ow! god damn! is this a job for intelligent men?!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{if there was one nearby i'd probably ask him.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{i keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(mock serious)}
<D>__{handymen, earl. we're handymen.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.}
<A>__{val gestures to the vastness around them.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{what, and give up all this personal freedom?}
<L>__{exterior jeep trail day}
<A>__{val guides the truck down a tortuous, rocky, almost impas sable trail. it takes full concentration as he fights the steering wheel, shifts, rides the brake and leans out trying to pick a decent route. earl braces his feet on the dash and munches breakfast, a raw hot dog right out of the package.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{has a lot of rain.}
<A>__{earl pulls a box of hershey bars from under the seat. there's only one bar left. he sets the box down between them. val glances at it and raises his fist: the challenge. one, two, three. val mimes "paper;" earl mimes "rock." earl loses. val takes the bar.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(pointing ahead)}
<D>__{you're gonna get us hung up.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{do not talk to the driver.}
<A>__{thwonk! the truck lurches to a stop, its frame caught on a big rock. val glares at earl.}
<L>__{exterior desert intersection pick up truck day}
<A>__{the pick up turns from a dirt road onto an old paved road.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{what do we have next?}
<L>__{interior pick up moving day}
<A>__{earl consults a crumpled list pulled from inside his hat.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{uh...digging that waterhole for nestor.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{burt and heather's place is closer. let's do their kitchen today. do nestor tomorrow.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{nestor's out of town tomorrow. we don't dig today. we don't get paid today. damn it, valentine, you never plan ahead. you never take the long view. hell, here it is monday and i'm already working on wednesday.}
<P>__{(squints dubiously at his schedule)}
<D>__{it is monday, right?}
<A>__{but val is peering at the desert up ahead. off the road a ways is a small toyota pick up truck and, beside it, a lone figure trying to flag them down.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{who the hell's that? that's not what's his name...the grad student?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{nah, it's september. must be the new one.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{the new one! that's supposed to be a girl!}
<A>__{earl braces himself, knowing what val will do. val swerves the truck wildly off the road, barreling across the desert.}
<C>__{val }
<P>__{(almost praying)}
<D>__{you will have long blonde hair, big green eyes, nice full breasts that stand up and say hello, ass that won't quit. and legs, legs that go all the way up!}
<A>__{earl shakes his head, mildly bemused as they slide to a stop in a cloud of dust.}
<L>__{exterior desert rhonda's truck day}
<A>__{val looks out hopefully. the dust clears. he sees her rhonda lebeck, (25). val's eyes do an expert vertical scan: short brown hair, small brown eyes, so so chest, legs hidden in baggy dungarees. laden with a portable computer, notebooks, and some seismograph printouts, she stares at him through tilted glasses. her little pick up truck is loaded with geology field equipment. she shakes val's hand firmly.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{hi, i'm rhonda. rhonda lebeck. i'm up here for the semester...}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{yeah, geography.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{right, geology. and you have to be val and earl. i've heard all about you.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{we deny everything.}
<A>__{rhonda smiles.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{listen, got a question for you. do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{around here? why would they?}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{well, i'm supposed monitor these seismographs. you know, they measure vibrations...}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{yeah, vibrations in the ground.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{yeah, well, i'm getting what i refer to scientifically as "weird vibes." every sensor i've got is giving me strange readings. i mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{well, we'll ask around. let you know if we hear of anything.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{thanks. god, i hope they're not screwed up. i might have to bag the whole semester. anyway, sorry to bother you.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{no problem. nice meeting you. hope you get it sorted out.}
<A>__{rhonda unhappily turns back to her equipment as val and earl drive off.}
<L>__{interior pick up truck moving day}
<A>__{earl glances over at val with a gleam in his eye.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{what the hell do we know about seismographs?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{nothing. but it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{goddamnit, valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours a to z...}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{well, sure.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{...and is dumber than my hind end. like that bobby lynn dexter...}
<A>__{val flips down the truck's sunvisor. tapes to it are snap shots of nearly identical blonde bimbos. val points to one.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{tammy lynn baxter.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{don't matter. they're all the same: dead weight. can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails. make my skin crawl!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{well, i'm a victim of circumstance.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{i thought you called it your pecker. look, don't make the mistake i made. twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like miss october 1968, and where'd it get me? here with you.}
<A>__{val rolls his eyes "give me a break."}
<L>__{exterior perfection establish day}
<A>__{the pick up rattles toward a tiny, utterly isolated high desert hamlet a few dozen houses and mobile homes fighting for shade in the vast landscape. its most prominent feature is an aging wood frame water tower, perhaps 25 feet high, near the center of town. a sign pans into view "perfection pop. 14."}
<L>__{exterior pham van's store day}
<A>__{val and earl head past the water tower for pham van's general store, perfection's main gossip stop and only business. the store's sign, in english and vietnamese, reads: "groceries, haircuts, post office, town hall, videos !" val and earl park next to a camouflage painted, large tired blazer. just then they spot melvin, the town's surly teen aged pain in the ass, coming toward them, mindlessly bouncing a basketball off the hoods of parked cars. as he nears their truck:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{melvin, touch that truck and die.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{oh, man, i'm really shaking.}
<A>__{but he steers clear of their truck.}
<L>__{interior pham van's store day}
<A>__{inside, the energetic vietnamese owner, pham van, presides over his all purpose establishment: part general store, part barber shop, part saloon. at the bar are burt gummer and his wife heather, two no nonsense survivalists who have settled in perfection to await the coming apocalypse a nice enough couple, but there's a hint of paranoia around the edges. burt is shoving a box of cartridges across to pham.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{no, pham, they're not hollow points. i ordered hollow points and that's what i want.}
<A>__{when val and earl enter, pham automatically pops the tops on two cold beers and has them in place before the cowboys reach the bar. everyone exchanged nods.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{hi, guys, what you been up to?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{ran into the new college student, rona.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{rhonda. rhonda lebeck. she's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the feds will be at our door. "sorry, time to move. eminent domain."}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{down, honey, down.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{yeah, burt. the way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive world war iii.}
<A>__{heather and pham laugh. burt smiles patiently. just then the compressor in pham's ice cream freezer comes on. it's a loud chug chug chug sound mixed with a high pitched squeal.}
<C>__{pham van}
<D>__{hey val, listen. bearing going out, you think?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{could be.}
<A>__{he starts toward the compressor, but earl heads him off.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{catch it later, pham. gotta get over to nestor's.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{right. we plan ahead. that way we don't do anything right now. earl explained it to me.}
<A>__{as they turn to go, val does a take, amazed, as he spots a decorative bleached out cattle skull displayed on the counter with a $29.95 price tag.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{hey, pham van, what the hell is this?}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{a beauty, isn't it? we bought three of them for the rec room.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(whispers to pham van)}
<D>__{we sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!}
<C>__{pham van}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{and i appreciate it.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(playfully)}
<D>__{you don't get it, pham. the idea was: we were ripping you off.}
<A>__{suddenly a car alarm blares from outside. burt's out the door in a flash. the others follow.}
<L>__{exterior pham van's store day}
<A>__{burt races out and shouts at melvin who back guiltily away from burt's camouflage blazer.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{melvin, you little pain in the ass!}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{it wasn't me, man! your truck's just screwed up, that's all.}
<A>__{burt angrily switches off the alarm. val and earl laugh as they climb into their truck.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{why don't his parents ever take him to vegas with them?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you gotta ask that ?}
<L>__{exterior pit day}
<A>__{at one end of town, earl maneuvers a huge bulldozer with a scoop loader blade through a choking cloud of dust, scouring out a shallow pit to serve as a watering hole. val sights down a row of stakes which mark one end of the pit. the job is done. he signals earl to cut the engine. both men have kerchiefs covering their faces and are totally encrusted with dust. angle truck trailer day nearby is an old battered truck trailer the massive, solid steel kind used for heavy rock hauling. tires flat, mired in dried mud and weeds, it hasn't been used in years. now it provides welcome shade as the men sit sipping some coffee. nestor cunningham drives up, surveying the pit with approval.}
<C>__{nestor}
<D>__{it came out great, boys. should fill up just fine come the next rain. lemme have your bill.}
<A>__{earl and val start fishing in their pockets for pen and paper. earl comes up with various pieces of paper, val with three or four pens. it's a moment before they realize each has the other needed implement. earl writes out the bill during:}
<C>__{nestor }
<D>__{i will have to send it to you the first of the month, boys.}
<A>__{val and earl exchange pained looks.}
<C>__{nestor }
<D>__{now, you know i'm good for it.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{yeah, nestor, we know. don't worry about it. catch us when you can.}
<A>__{they amble over to their truck. earl takes the driver's side and starts fishing in his pockets for the key.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{are we too easy going?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{no, we're not too easy going. this area is economically depressed.}
<A>__{val realizes he has the key and hands it over.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{so what if we just did it...today. pack up. drive straight down to bixby. get serious.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{we could. we could. but we'd have to get really serious. it's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{so? that car wash pays good, and they're always looking.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{car wash?! that's got no future. if we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{yeah, sure. go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.}
<L>__{exterior viola's place day}
<A>__{close on a stencilled sign: pham van's u rent cesspool, septic tanks. pull out to see val and earl have rented a portable septic pump (perhaps trailer mounted). the aged machine reeks of and drips with its ignoble cargo. the intake hose has been repaired so often it looks to be more tape than hose. grimacing val threads the slimy hose down through the open top of viola's cesspool. beside them is viola's well kept mobile home on a low hill not far from pham van's store. well kept flower gardens surround the place. viola, a sweet little old lady, watches the men work while straining to hold the leash of her tiny but ferocious dog. the dog yaps continuously, lunging at val and earl.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{stop it! stop it, you horrid animal!}
<P>__{(to val and earl)}
<D>__{i'm going to give her back to my son. i swear it.}

<D>__{hey, viola, you've got my permission.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{god almighty, my mama sure didn't raise me for this.}
<A>__{val gets up and starts the pump's gas engine.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{well, you're the one won't work in the car wash. you're the one's gotta have a plan.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{damn it, val! not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!}
<A>__{earl angrily throws the pump valve and starts the pump mechanism. he and val on stand either side of the intake hose as it gurgles happily.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{what keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet. i was up for going to bixby. i was getting excited.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{in the past year i must've said a hundred times "we gotta get out of perfection. we gotta better ourselves." you gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think i'm the reason we're still here? you want to know how close i am to going to bixby right now ?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{i will call that little bluff. how close?}
<A>__{pow! goooosh! the gurgling intake hose ruptures, showering them with well you know. they react as if they'd been shot; gagging, staggering, screaming obscenities.}
<L>__{exterior val and earl's trailer day}
<A>__{val and earl's beat up mobile home is just down the street from pham van's store. val and earl, now in cleaner clothes, march out resolutely. val has a portable tv in one hand and a framed coors beer sign in the other. earl unhooks the clothes line and dumps it, clothes and all, into the back of their truck, on top of the rest of their belongings. they stare at each other for a moment. this is it. no going back. they leap into the truck. as they drive off, val leans out and yanks their wooden nameplate ("e. basset v. mckee") off the mailbox.}

<C>__{val}
<D>__{that's the plan.}
<A>__{they stop beside nancy. while they talk, nancy's daughter, mindy (9), comes bouncing along on her pogo stick, listening to her walkman and slowly circling the truck.}

<D>__{mindy, honey, don't pogo in the street. hey, guys, i've got a job for you...}
<C>__{earl}

<C>__{val}
<P>__{(definite)}
<D>__{the rifle.}
<A>__{so does earl. he raises his hand. they swiftly do a round of scissors rock paper. earl loses. he hands val the rifle. just then, burt and heather pull up in their blazer, climbing out with their hunting rifles.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{you guys all set?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{ready as we'll ever be.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{heather and i are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{good idea. and we'll swing by the doctor's place. they were going to go into bixby but we don't know if they left before the road was out.}
<A>__{val and earl mount up.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{hold on. you guys oughta take something that packs more punch than that thirty thirty. take one of our browning autos, or even my model seventy...}
<P>__{(offers her hunting rifle)}
<D>__{it's three seventy five h and h mag.}
<A>__{earl takes the awesome looking gun with a smug glance at val.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{gee...thanks, heather. hope we don't need it.}
<A>__{heather unhooks a box of cartridges from her belt and hands it to earl. suddenly there's a blood curdling scream! the door to pham van's flies open. out staggers melvin, wrapped in pham van's hook tentacle, writhing in apparent agony.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{it's got me! it's got me! aaaahgh!}
<A>__{people scatter like sheep. burt and heather have guns trained on him in an instant. then everyone realizes it's a sick joke. melvin collapses with laughter. burt is livid. he almost shot melvin. he charges over and yanks the kid to his feet, screaming:}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{you stupid punk! you came that close, that close!!}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{one of these days, melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.}
<A>__{pham rushes over and grabs his precious tentacle. as people calm down, val and earl gaze nervously at the vast desert before them.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{well...you fellas watch yourselves.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{come back with the sheriff.}
<C>__{nestor}
<D>__{sheriff, like hell. come back with the national guard.}
<A>__{they ride out to an adlib chorus: "keep your heads down;" "go careful, boys;" "keep a sharp lookout;" etc.}
<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{val and earl ride along, very tiny in the vast, lonely landscape, and very on edge. constantly looking all around.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you know, we can't possibly make bixby by nightfall.}
<A>__{val doesn't want to hear it.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{that means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(resentfully)}
<D>__{great. thank you.}
<A>__{faint country and western radio music drifts to them. they're nearing jim and megan's house.}

<A>__{val knocks on the door to the mobile home.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{hey, doctor, anybody here?}
<A>__{no answer. he opens the door and peers inside. behind him earl steps out of the half finished house and shrugs. nobody around. wind rustles the plastic sheeting over the windows. strangely they can still hear the muffled radio clearly.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(spooked)}
<D>__{oh, man, i hate this shit.}
<A>__{they walk briskly to their horses. earl snatches heather's rifle from its saddle scabbard. val pulls out the winchester. earl tries to reassure himself.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{car's gone. we just missed them, that's all.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{then where's the goddamn conway twitty coming from?}
<A>__{they focus on the sound and walk gingerly toward it, keeping constant watch in every direction. the ground here is all torn up like the sheep pen and the music is coming from underneath ! what the hell is going on? val scrapes at the dirt with his boot and finds the headlight of jim and megan's station wagon, still on, glaring up at him. he drops down and wildly sweeps away more dirt, revealing more of the car's grille and hood and blood soaked dirt which sticks to his hand. he leaps away, frantically rubbing the blood off on his pants.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{oh, man...oh, man...}
<L>__{exterior desert concrete ditch day}
<A>__{val and earl are riding at full gallop. they race alongside a concrete lined flood control ditch and veer off to follow a barbed wire fence which crosses the ditch.}
<L>__{exterior desert barbed wire fence day}
<A>__{they ride along the fence during:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{here's the plan...we don't even stop. ride like hell. tonight we keep right on going. we'll walk the horses.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{that is the plan...i mean, goddamn it! what the hell are those things? how could they bury an entire plymouth station wagon?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{why would they do it?}
<A>__{suddenly the horses stop short. in a frenzy they wheel around, rear up, refusing to go on. the cowboys fight to control them.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{i knew it! pham van wouldn't know a decent horse if...!}
<A>__{but earl's already drawing his rifle.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{shut up! they got wind of something they don't like!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{oh shit!}
<A>__{he draws his rifle. they look wildly in all directions at once but there's nothing, only empty desert.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{but i don't see anything!}
<A>__{they keep staring. the horses keep pacing nervously. then earl's horse rears wildly and falls! earl goes flying. val wheels around wildly, dismounts and runs to earl, who's bruised and winded but basically unhurt. they think earl's horse just tripped.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{hey, you okay? you okay?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{yeah...yeah.}
<P>__{(turning to the horse)}
<D>__{what about the hor...?}
<A>__{their eyes bulge. several "snake things" have engulfed the horse's head, sucking, crushing, slurping. val's horse goes berserk and gallops for the horizon.}
<C>__{earl }
<D>__{what in the name...?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{that's how they get you! they're under the goddamn ground !}
<A>__{suddenly they realize what that means the thing could come up under them !! the cowboys scramble frantically away. but nothing pursues them. they pause, glancing back nervously.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{what the hell are they?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{sons of bitches!}
<A>__{val raises his rifle and takes a well aimed shot, hitting one of them. orange goo spurts out. we hear a deafening shriek as all the "snake things" instantly zip back underground. then a huge mound of earth rises up under val and earl!! the cowboys tumble down its side, val losing his rifle. they roll over and stare dumbfounded at the mound.}
<C>__{val }
<P>__{(gasps)}
<D>__{there must be a million of them!!}
<A>__{the mound of earth turns toward them. the ground splits open and out rises a huge head!}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(awestruck)}
<D>__{nope...just one.}
<A>__{the monster is a horrendous thirty foot long eating machine! its head is eyeless, utterly alien, covered with tough boney plates which close together to form a cork screw pointerior the cowboys stumble back toward the fence in speechless terror. the creature slides toward them, pushing through the earth like a whale through water. now it opens its mouth but it's like a grotesque flower, boney plates spreading open like petals, revealing a huge, slimy, fleshy, oozing orifice! and inside the mouth, a ghastly multi tentacled tongue! these are the "snake things," not snakes at all but actually the horrid hook tentacles that can shoot out six feet to snag their prey! the monster snorts and snuffs, throwing up plumes of dust, sounding like a horrendous pig. it sinks into the earth and charges! we see the hump of earth move toward them faster and faster but then it disappears as the creature goes deeper. val and earl leap sideways and run along the fence. the creature goes straight and slams into a fencepost from below. all we see is the fencepost knocked at a crazy angle. the cowboys keep running. the creature regroups and charges after them, hitting each fencepost in turn, sending weird sinuous shock waves along the barbed wire, making almost musical twanging sounds. val looks back.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{it's gaining on us!!}
<A>__{and as if that weren't enough, earl points to more trouble ahead.}
<L>__{exterior concrete ditch day}
<A>__{the fence runs straight to the edge of the ditch, an eight foot wide gap yawning dead ahead. the creature churns like a locomotive from behind. they'll have to try to jump! they strain desperately for every last fraction of speed.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{we can do it, we can do it!}
<A>__{they leap and they don't do it!! they smack into the opposite side of the ditch, clawing frantically at the lip, only to tumble to its sloping bottom. a split second later the charging creature slams like a wrecking ball into the foot thick concrete wall! the wall cracks and bulges out! a hook tentacle flops out through one of the cracks! terrified val and earl scramble away. but the wall holds together. and the, strangely, all is quiet. the tentacle lays dead still. eventually, the cowering cowboys dare to creep back a little closer, still panting, exhausted, jumpy.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{stupid son of a bitch...knocked itself cold.}
<A>__{and now orange slime begins to ooze through the cracks in the concrete.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{cold, my ass! it's dead! we killed the bastard!}
<A>__{he suddenly shakes his fist at the dead beast.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{you fucker!!}
<A>__{they allow themselves a small wheeze of nervous laughter, only to jump like rabbits as some pebbles rattle loudly down the concrete wall behind them. they whirl to see rhonda, up on the opposite side of the ditch, staring down at them. she's lugging a bunch of her equipment, including a small folding shovel.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{hi, guys, how're you doing? look, can i ask you something? did you just notice something weird? vibrations? you know, some kind of earth tremor?}
<A>__{val and earl look at each other, then burst out laughing. rhonda spots the cracked wall.}
<C>__{rhonda }
<D>__{what's that?}
<L>__{exterior concrete ditch day}
<A>__{the shattered concrete has been pulled away to fully reveal the creature's horrendous head. start close on it: oozing blood, slavering mouth plates hanging open, hook tentacles lolling out. widen to see earl and rhonda, sweating, dusty and tired, staring in awe and cringing at the stench.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{jesus christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{i don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{i think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in. good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<P>__{(shudders)}
<D>__{yeah, i'm lucky it didn't find me .}
<P>__{(overwhelmed)}
<D>__{this is important, you know. this is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century. the century? forget it. history .}
<A>__{we can hear a shovel digging up above, and now val shouts:}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{i got it! here's the other end! just look at what we caught here!}
<A>__{earl and rhonda climb up. crane up with them to reveal the whole animal! val, digging excitedly with rhonda's shovel, is just scraping away the last loose dirt from the creature's tail. the whole length of the immense thirty foot beast is partially uncovered, in king sized bas relief.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{this is one big mother!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{so this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?}
<A>__{she nods, stepping down to study the creature. the body is stream lined, cigar shaped, maybe eight feet in diameter at its thickest. it's covered with hundreds of short, rear pointing, retractable spikes. rhonda gingerly jiggles one. it can be pushed in and out of its socket like a plunger.}
<C>__{rhonda }
<D>__{it must push itself along with these. hundreds of them pushing at once. that's how it can move so fast. i mean this thing was tripping sensors all over the valley. no wonder i couldn't...}
<A>__{a chilling thought stops her in mid sentence. she springs down into the drainage ditch to get her backpack, pulling out her seismograph printouts. she studies them frantically during:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{hey, rhonda, you ever heard of any thing like this before?}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(elbows earl)}
<D>__{sure, earl, everybody knows about them. we just didn't tell you . come on, nobody's ever seen one of these! we're really in on something here!}
<A>__{the guys looks at each other. one thought immediately springs to their minds.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{pham van don't get his mitts on this for no measly fifteen bucks!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{you got that right!}
<A>__{while they bask in their fame to be, rhonda continues to study the print outs, coming to a terrifying conclusion.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, i guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{naw, don't want to winch it. that'd tear it all up. want to lift it. some kind of crane with lifting straps.}
<A>__{but rhonda interrupts now really scared.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{hey, hey, shut up! the way i figure it. there are five more of these things!}
<A>__{val and earl shut right up. earl edges up a fencepost. val sidles up onto a rock during:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{five more?}
<A>__{rhonda paws through her unwieldy printouts, pointing out jagged ink lines on the graphs, comparing different ones.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{yeah, darn it, look. i've got seismographs all over the valley. if you compare the different readings, there have to be five. here's one at two o'clock yesterday, but here's another one three miles away at the same time. so that's two. now, here...}
<A>__{the men leap from their perches and hustle her in the direction she came from.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{we'll take your word for it.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{yeah. where's your truck?}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{the other side of that dome.}
<A>__{she indicates what to most of us would be a hill, dotted with huge boulders thrusting out of the sandy desert soil like big mushrooms. the trio jogs toward the hill.}
<L>__{exterior desert seismograph day}
<A>__{en route to the truck, they pass near one of rhonda's seismographs. suddenly earl stumbles as one leg drops knee deep into the ground! he screams. val wheels and bodily yanks him up. they back away from the small hole in the ground, calming a little as they realize:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{prairie dog burrow...}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{little sons of bitches.}
<A>__{rhonda tenses as she hears a sound she knows well the soft scratching of the seismograph needle across its paper cylinder. she whacks val on the shoulder and points speechlessly at it. insert seismograph the needle is going wild!!}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{she doesn't have to explain. all three of them dash dash for:}
<L>__{exterior boulder field day}
<A>__{the remains of an old rail fence lay beside one of the boulders. val, earl, and rhonda scramble over the wood, up onto the rock and stand there tensely. in a moment, the creature gently rustles the earth at the base of the rock. the monster's slimy hook tentacles slither out, searching the rock base. shuddering, the humans move as high as they can, well out of reach. the tentacles slip back beneath the earth. everyone breathes a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{well, at least the bastard can't climb. pardon my french.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{god, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{okay, now, how far's your truck?}
<A>__{rhonda points. they can see the roof of her truck, maybe a hundred yards away through the boulders. val and earl think about it.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{i don't know. if this one's any faster than that other one...}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(nods)}

<L>__{exterior boulder field sunset}
<A>__{it's hours later. stiff and uncomfortable, they have nothing to do but theorize.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{there's nothing like them in the fossil record, i'm sure...okay, so they predate the fossil record...}
<P>__{(not buying it herself)}
<D>__{that'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now. right.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{i'd vote for outer space. no way those are local boys.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(joking)}
<D>__{atomic testing. or, no, bio engineering! the government built them, a big surprise in the next war.}
<A>__{there's a long pause. earl stares at the dirt around the rock.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{well...haven't seen a sign for hours. maybe it's long gone.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{maybe it is. why don't you take a little stroll and see?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{fuck you, too. pardon my french.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{well, we've got to do something .}
<A>__{val gets an idea. he grabs a post from the dilapidated fence and cautiously slips down near the boulder's edge.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{watch yourself! it's got a good six foot reach.}
<A>__{val nods. dead silence as he reaches way out with the post and scrapes it on the ground. almost instantly the creature roars up, grabbing the post in a flurry of flying dirt and lashing tentacles, nearly hooking val's hand. val practically falls over himself scrambling back to safety.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{son of a bitch!}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{son of a god damned bitch! been waiting there all this time. how the hell's it even know we're still here?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{it's been listening to us. it's got no eyes. it sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so i figure...}
<A>__{rhonda stares at val, impressed.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{of course! it can sense the slightest seismic vibration...hear every move we make. especially on this rock. it's a perfect conductor.}
<A>__{they all settle back, having no idea what to do nexterior rhonda gazes out at the desert that surrounds them like an ocean.}

<D>__{first let's see if stumpy's still out there.}

<A>__{they watch in surprise as she hefts her pole, checks the balance, eyeballs the distance to the nearest boulder. then she charges between them, plants her pole and vaults smoothly over to the next boulder, maybe fifteen feet away. the creature surfaces where her pole touched down, but too late a hook tentacle vainly sweeps the area, the disappears into the ground. val and earl glance at each other, impressed .}
<C>__{rhonda }
<D>__{we just stay where it can't get us...on these residual boulders. my truck's parked right next to one.}

<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{burt, you bastard!}
