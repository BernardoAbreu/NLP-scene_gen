<C>__{juno}
<D>__{did your wife send you up here to spy on me?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what? no! do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. i could be a total klepto, for all you know.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't get a klepto vibe from you. evil genius? maybe. arsonist? wouldn't rule it out.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i did steal a squirt of perfume. what do you think? it's clinique happy.}

<D>__{wait a minute. is that a les paul?}
<A>__{juno is staring into a room with the door slightly ajar. we see guitars mounted on the wall, and the edges of posters.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{oh. that's, uh, my room. vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{wow, you get a whole room in your own house? she's got you on a long leash there, mark.}
