<L>__{ext desert, hooker ranch day}
<A>__{armed with a borrowed pistol and carbine, wyatt gallops through the desert on one of his other big blacks, eyes scanning the tracks beneath him. he rides up and stops at a well near a large ranch house. he dismounts, studying tracks as rancher henry hooker rides up, strong, noble looking, like something from a frederic remington canvas. wyatt nods. hooker nods back.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{this hooker's ranch?}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{that's right. and i'm hooker.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{you seen anything of a man on horseback leading a black stallion?}
<A>__{hooker suddenly falls silent, looking at the ground nervously.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{well you must've seen somethin', the trail runs right by your waterhole.}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{oh, i see. so it must've been a cowboy, right? really got you people treed, don't they?}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{look, mister, it's fine for you boomers to court trouble, you're just passin' through. us cattlemen gotta live here. best i can do's point you up to the cut. that's their roost.}
<A>__{wyatt nods his thanks. hooker looks down, ashamed. wyatt stares at him a moment. there's something genuinely troubling about so strong a man living in fear. wyatt rides on, shaking his head....}
