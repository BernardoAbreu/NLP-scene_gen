<L>__{interior chief davis' office day}
<A>__{davis is filling out paperwork as the door opens. he looks up as los angeles mayor george cryer enters, closing the door after him again.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{mayor cryer...this is unexpected.}
<C>__{cryer}
<D>__{so was this.}
<A>__{he drops a series of court documents on davis' desk. he picks them up, examines them.}
<C>__{cryer}
<D>__{subpoenas, requests for depositions, interrogatories...all courtesy of mr. hahn and his new client, christine collins.}
<P>__{(more)}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{cryer }
<D>__{you don't have to look them over too closely, chief, your own copies should be arriving any time now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the city council has also agreed to look into this, starting immediately.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{goddamnit....}
<C>__{cryer}
<D>__{i thought this was supposed to go away. this is an election year, i can't afford this kind of press.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{it is going away, sir. i instructed captain jones }
<C>__{cryer}
<D>__{i'm afraid falling on his sword and saying he made a mistake isn't going to be good enough, chief. if we take him out of the picture for a while, it might help calm things down until the hearing's finished.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there are several people on the council who are planning to run against me, and they'd love to accuse me of allowing a renegade police force to operate with impunity.}
<A>__{cryer shakes his head, walks off a pace.}
<C>__{cryer}
<D>__{our friends in the press are having a field day with this mess. i'm getting five hundred phone calls, letters and telegrams a day demanding to know what the hell is going on at city hall that we allow our police force to brutalize women and misplace children. christ, all this picture needs now is for somebody to kick a puppy for the cameras.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this is a train, chief, and we need to either get in front of it, or be run over by it.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{mayor cryer...i stand by my men. you know that.}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{cryer}
<D>__{i do. and you know where i stand. so the question is..are we going to stand together...or hang together?}
<A>__{he lets the question sit as we go to}
