<L>__{interior l.a. airport security check}
<A>__{rick stands in line at the luggage x ray machine. he impatiently checks his watch as the x ray checker chats him up. a crazed anarchist holding a large bomb passes through the security check unquestioned.}
<D>__{x ray checker my kids just loved you in "hey dude three: the final countdown." we need more wholesome role models like you.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{where the fuck is ernie?}
<A>__{we hear women's screams. they turn towards the noise and see a bunch of stewardesses scattering from a trendy young cad with a fake hand sticking out of his fly. this is ernie, rick's buddy and resident court jester.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{ladies! all i wanted was a manicure! yah ha ha!}
<P>__{(he sees rick)}
<D>__{it's the coog!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{it's the ernie! woof! woof! woof!}
<A>__{rick pumps ernie's third "hand." the miffed x ray checker points to rick's large carry on bag as it emerges from the x ray machine.}
<D>__{x ray checker}
<P>__{(to rick)}
<D>__{mister coogan, is this your bag?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{yeah, why? x ray checker is this your kid?}
<A>__{he indicates the x ray monitor, where we see the skeleton outline of a bucktoothed, bespectacled 10 year old kid curled up in rick's bag. the kid waves. rick and ernie look at each other in horror.}
<D>__{rick ernie stuey gluck!}
<A>__{the bag bursts open, and out pops stuey gluck, an obsessive young autograph hound toting a stack of scrapbooks and memorabilia.}
<C>__{stuey}
<D>__{rick! rick! look! i got a rare still from your high school production of the glass menagerie! could you sign it for me? please?!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{no!}
<P>__{(to ernie)}
<D>__{let's get the hell out of here!}
<A>__{ernie nods and yanks the bag away from under stuey. they run away down the corridor. stuey chases them, holding up an 8 by 10 photo.}
<C>__{stuey}
<D>__{rick! wait up!}
<B>__{further down the corridor}
<A>__{rick and ernie run around a corner with stuey in pursuit.}
<C>__{stuey}
<D>__{rick! remember the speech you gave at the actors forum for social justice!?}
<A>__{he holds up a cassette player and hits play. it's rick's old speech.}
<C>__{rick's voice }
<D>__{if all the world is a stage, then let us shine the spotlight on truth, integrity, and a deep compassion for all life.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{leave me alone, troll!}
<P>__{(to ernie)}
<D>__{that was before i got an entertainment lawyer.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{quick, down here.}
<A>__{ernie leads rick down an adjacent hallway.}
<B>__{in the hallway}
<A>__{it's a dead end. rick and ernie are trapped. ernie gives rick a sheepish look. stuey stands at the entrance of the hallway. he holds up a time magazine.}
<C>__{stuey}
<D>__{rick! rick! it says here noxon's dangerous. why are you lending your name to it? what's happened to you, rick? you used to be good! and now... i just don't know...}
<A>__{stuey starts to cry. rick looks guilty.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{don't cry, stuey, i'm still good.}
<A>__{bam! a passing electric baggage cart nails stuey at full speed and carries him off down the corridor, screaming bloody murder.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{alright!}
<A>__{rick and ernie high five.}
