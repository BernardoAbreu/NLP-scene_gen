<B>__{au bar}
<A>__{letour's sedan waits between limos. inside, john passes the maitre d', looks around: he's known here. au bar, a restaurant club open 9:00 p. m. to 4:00 a. m., caters to the young, the rich, the european. he spots tis with thomas, twenty five, his handsome trainer, and two models at a second floor table. they exchange nods. letour scans the room: suspicion is second nature. a laughing man (guidone) at the bar catches his eye. he seems to blend: italian, twenty eight, silk suit, impeccable hair, accent but something's not right. his black shoes have rubber soles. letour looks for a gun bulge, dirty hands. the italian turns; letour glimpses his face: too pale. the italian averts his eyes. glancing back, letour walks up the stairs to tis' table.}
