<L>__{exterior street n night}
<A>__{parked against the curb opposite the driveway of the murder house is an old green pontiac convertible with the top up. the driver's window is down and from inside a woman, late}
<L>__{20's, is watching the house. interior murder house n night}
<A>__{atwood stops in the pantry almost in the exact spot where mr. brooks stopped. the quiet is filled by the rain drumming on the roof. the wind rattles the windows.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{how did you know where they were in the house?}
<A>__{she steps into the kitchen. on the way across she bumps into a chair.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{it's darker tonight than it was on your night. but still how did you manage not to bump into the furniture? did you have a little light? that would be too dangerous. i will bet you were in the house before.}
<C>__{detective atwood }
<D>__{so i should ask the neighbors if they saw a meter reader around the house or a telephone repairman or someone from the gas company.}
<A>__{these musings take her through the living room to the entrance of the hallway where she pauses and looks both ways.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{once again, how did you know where they were? did you check the rooms before you found them? she had his semen in her vagina, they had just made love, did you hear them or was there a light on?}
<A>__{she steps into the hall.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{and when did you bag the gun? because even though i'm sure you're an expert at it, there's still a chance of noise from the plastic.}
<A>__{she continues down the hall to the bedroom.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{was the door open or did you have to open it?}
<A>__{she opens the door and goes in.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{were they asleep or awake? was the light on, or did you turn it on? because i know you, you wouldn't risk a shot in the dark.}
<A>__{she turns on the overhead light.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{too bright. what if it wasn't that light that was on, but this one?}
<A>__{she turns on a bedside light and goes back to the door and turns off the overhead. if the dance couple were on the bed and their blood was not on the wall, the room would look exactly the way it did when mr. brooks said 'hello'.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{that's better... what thrill do you get by killing people? is it sexual, is it hate, is it power? do you feel remorse? probably that part of your brain doesn't exist. do you have emotions of love or affection or joy? or have you learned to fake them so you won't stand out in a crowd.}
<A>__{she's at the window now, feeling the curtains.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{what if these are stuck closed because you yanked them closed? which means they were open when you came into the room.}
<A>__{she separates the fabric and looks out the rain streaked window at the four story building across the alley. there are lights on in almost all the apartment windows.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{if mr. and miss normal made love with the curtains open and the lights on, someone in that building noticed them and may have seen you.}
<A>__{she allows the fabric to drop back into place and turns to look at the bed.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{was that what you were angry about?}
