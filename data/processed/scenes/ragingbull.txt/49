<C>__{detroit promoter}
<D>__{oh joey, this is jackie curtie. he handles a lot of business in south ohio.}
<C>__{jackie curtie}
<D>__{i like your brother. made a lot of money on him.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{betcha more than he has.}
<C>__{jackie curtie}
<D>__{made a little cabbage on the tommy bell fight too. whatever happened to him?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{ain't he dead?}
<C>__{detroit promoter}
<D>__{nah. he's got a job downtown. runs an elevator in some building.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{detroit promoter}
<D>__{went down to see him the other day. i says, "tommy, take me up to the fifth floor." and you know, he took me right up there.}

<C>__{joey }
<P>__{(to vickie)}
<D>__{c'mere, let me talk to you for a minute.}
<A>__{there is an awkward silence as he grabs vickie by the arm and takes her over to the hat check area.}
<C>__{joey }
<D>__{what're you doin' with salvy? you shouldn't be here with him. jake's away killin' himself. suppose he found out.}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{what the hell am i doing wrong? just because jake is training, i can't go out? what am i, a goddamn prisoner?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{no, you're his wife.}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{i'm not doing anythina wrong. i'm just trying to have a good time. do i have to be cooped up in the house all the time?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{it don't look right.}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{well, go ahead, tell jake. he's gonna kill me anyway. it's a matter of time.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. what's the matter with you? aren't you happy? you got everything you want.}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{you don't sleep with him. i do. i don't get to breathe without tellin' him. he keeps me in a cage. if he thinks i'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, i get used as a punching bag. he don't trust nobody. if he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too believe me. look at me, joey. i'm 19 years old. i wanna enjoy my life. i love jake, but you don't know. he gets crazy sometimes. i'm scared.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{try to understand, vickie. jake's got a lotta aggravation. he's been a top contender too long.}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{that's right, take his part. you're his brother. he's never gonna be champ. too many people are against him.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{and you're drinking with them right now.}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{and i'm gonna finish my drink. and, i'm gonna have a good time, because i ain't doing nothing wrong.}
<A>__{she starts to go back to the table.}
<C>__{joey}
<P>__{(grabbing her)}
<D>__{you're wrong to be here. let's go.}
<A>__{vickie pulls away from joey, and goes back to the table. the table area: joey arrives at the table. he grabs vickie.}
<C>__{joey }
<D>__{i said, let's go.}
<C>__{salvy}
<D>__{joey, relax. you're taking this the wrong way. why don't you sit down and have a drink?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{excuse me, i'm talking to my sister in law.}
<C>__{salvy}
<D>__{excuse me for living.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{what do you think, i'm blind? my brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.}
<C>__{salvy}
<D>__{hey joey, i'm here with patsy and vera and sandy. and vickie just happened to come along. we're just trying to have a good time. what do you want from me? so, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.}
<A>__{as the conversation gets louder, people begin to notice. paul, the owner (a tough looking, well dressed guy), and some bouncers also become aware of the argument.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{get the fuck outa here. what did you do, take your gangster pills today? i will tear your fuckin' head off your shoulders!}
<A>__{joey goes for salvy. people react. the girls begin to scream. vickie exits. joey notices her leave, and calls after her.}
<C>__{joey }
<D>__{hey, wait }
<A>__{paul comes over and stops the fight.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{ain't you forgettin' something? ain't there never supposed to be no trouble in this joint?}
