<A>__{(dale, hedonia) dale stands amongst the exotic females of this lavish place, being gently but firmly divested of her clothes and put into a diaphanous gown. they intend her no harm. though each has some slight unearthly peculiarity, all are very beautiful. tickled, dale can't suppress a giggle. the females are amazed and delighted by this phenomenon. they take turns poking at her ribs as tall hedonia glides up, bearing a flagon of green liquid.}

<C>__{dale }
<D>__{say, this stuff isn't bad at all.}
