<L>__{interior catherine's bedroom day}
<A>__{catherine and bobby lie side by side. he watches her as she addresses the ceiling:}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i married him when i was 17. he was a cellist, and i thought he was the most brilliant man i'd ever met... and i'm sure he was, because at that age, i hadn't met that many... but he was insidious, you know. he had me convinced that i was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. but in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. anyway, i just woke up one morning and i said, you know something joseph, you're full of beans, and i left him...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that's what you said?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{something witty and devastating like that.}
<A>__{she moves onto her side, looking over at him.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{as a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to carl...}
<P>__{(a pause, then:)}
<D>__{how are you?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{carl restored my confidence. he really did. he's much more substantial than you give him credit for.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{is he?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{she reaches over, tentatively caressing his face, then:}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah, i think i could.}
<A>__{he kisses her, gets up and crosses to the door, and as he opens it:}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{robert?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before carl comes back, i mean, if you'd like to.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{of course i'd like to.}
