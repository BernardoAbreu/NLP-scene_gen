<A>__{as it explodes, cameron is blown through the wall on fire. he tumbles to the ground, frantically writhes, rolls, trying to smother the flames, finally collapsing in some wagon tracks filled with muddy water. cameron lifts his head at the approach of a thundering sound...an english caisson hurtles toward him, the driver dead and mangled over the barrel of the gun, the horses insane with terror. before cameron can move, the charging horses are on top of him. he rolls between their hooves, the giant steel wheel of the caisson barely missing him. shells from a cannon barrage are bursting all about. cameron staggers to his feet and scrambles over a low stone wall for protection, drops to the other side and then hurtles into the air as the wall is shattered by an exploding shell.}
