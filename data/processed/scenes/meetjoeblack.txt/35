<L>__{interior hallway, parrish townhouse next morning}
<A>__{parrish, dressed for the day, passes servants busy with their morning tasks, polishing doorknobs, putting away linen, dusting picture frames. he nods and greets them as he strides down the hall, brisk "good morning"'s to coyle and luisa.}
<L>__{interior guest suite, parrish townhouse morning}
<A>__{parrish knocks, waits a courteous moment, opens the door, finds joe in an elegant shirt and trousers trying to tie his tie.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{good morning.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{good morning, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{how are you? how're you feeling?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{'feeling'? i feel fine. how do you feel?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{um well, i didn't sleep too well. this is crazy. this is the left field thing of all time. what do i do? what do i tell my family?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh, i wouldn't tell them anything, bill. you'll ruin the good start we had last night. i felt as if i were being treated like a person. 'joe' this and 'joe' that a nice smile quince passed me the rolls no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but i am cer tain, should you uh say uh who i am our adventure would end abruptly.}
<A>__{parrish regards joe, the tie is a sorry mess now, a batwing of silk stretching across his collarbone.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{but i did so enjoy your family.}
<A>__{parrish is startled, he regards joe carefully.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what about my family? this 'adven ture' involved only me, right?}
<A>__{silence as joe considers the point, parrish quickly crosses to him, undoes the tie, and now begins tying it for him.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{tell you what, you promised that it's going to be only me and }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{and what?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{and i won't tell anyone who you are.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sounds fair enough.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{it is a deal?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{a 'deal'?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you give your word, i give mine that we'll do what we say. it's a truth exchanged between two people.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{bill }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you've got a deal.}
<A>__{parrish seems relieved. he has now, with some difficulty, completed the tying of joe's tie, adjusts it beautifully on joe's collar, then spins him around in front of a mirror. joe, catching sight of his own appearance, rises to the balls of his feet, quite taken.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{this is great!}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{now what do we do?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{shake hands.}
<A>__{joe immediately extends his hand toward parrish, but parrish freezes on seeing the hand, stares at it, now takes it. joe pumps parrish's hand vigorously, then breaks into a broad smile.}
