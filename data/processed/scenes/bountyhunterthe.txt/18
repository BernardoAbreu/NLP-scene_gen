<L>__{ext jersey city late afternoon}
<A>__{move in on the parade we just saw on tv. baton twirlers in santa hats. men dressed like reindeer, pulling a sleigh. a boys choir singing "joy to the world", the kids dressed like orphans that escaped a broadway musical. a beautiful scene, if you like that sort of thing. rack to the cadillac, half a block away, cruising sideways into a spot just beneath a "temporary tow away" sign. milo climbs out of the car. shoves his way through the crowd to the curb, cracking open a can of pabst. milo does not like this sort of thing. he scans the crowd impatiently. meanwhile, the car that was following him parks half a block away. dwight emerges and heads for: milo, who has just found what he's looking for. the reindeer are passing him and he makes eye contact with rudolph, who does a double take.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{yeah, you. rudolph. come here, you fucking ding dong.}
<A>__{milo takes a step towards rudolph and dwight appears in milo's path, blocking him.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{we have to stop meeting this way.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{not now, dwight.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{you owe my boss money.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{hey, i owe everybody money.}
<A>__{suddenly, dwight punches milo in the gut. milo doubles up, gasping, then brings his head up quick, catching dwight on the chin. dwight goes flying sideways and meets a police barrier face first. ouch. the barrier tips over, knocking over the one next to it. the rest go like dominos. milo turns to see that rudolph has disappeared. then he catches sight of the antlers, working their way through the crowd. milo lunges after him and rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid milo. the sleigh flips. santa tumbles from the sled. packages}
<B>__{rain down on reindeer like shrapnel.}
<A>__{all of a sudden, it's the xmas from hell: bloody reindeer stumbling around, santa unconscious in the gutter, kids screaming, parents panicking. meanwhile, milo is gaining on rudolph, who picks up one of the packages and throws it. it cracks milo in the head. just what milo has been waiting for:}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(beaming)}
<D>__{i am so happy you did that.}
<A>__{milo tackles rudolph to the ground. around them, people scream and scatter. one boy bursts into tears:}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{that man is killing rudolph!}
<A>__{sirens. uh oh. cops swarm the scene, surrounding milo and rudolph, guns drawn. the lead cop (gelman, short, over zealous) steps forward:}
<C>__{gelman}
<D>__{release the reindeer!}
<A>__{release the reindeer? milo looks around. he's got 8 or so guns pointed his way and rudolph gasping at his feet. milo starts to laugh. gelman bristles:}
<C>__{gelman}
<D>__{hands behind your head, asshole!}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{take it easy, skippy, i'm just doing my job.}
<A>__{milo flashes his id. gelman inspects it, rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{gelman}
<D>__{bounty hunter. figures. why don't you get a real job?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{so i can be like you patrol boys and sit around all day with my thumb up my ass?}
<A>__{gelman turns bright red.}
<C>__{gelman}
<D>__{what did you just say?}
<A>__{suddenly, a sergeant (bobby, late 30's, obnoxious but likeable, milo's ex partner) marches onto the scene, takes one look at milo and laughs.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{milo boyd. i shoulda known.}
<C>__{gelman}
<D>__{sarg, you know this asshole?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah. i know this asshole. guy used to be one of us.}
<A>__{rack to dwight, nose bleeding, melting back into shadow...}
