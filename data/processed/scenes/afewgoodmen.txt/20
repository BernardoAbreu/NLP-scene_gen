<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{have i done something wrong?}

<A>__{kaffee and sam exchange a look.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(to jo)}
<D>__{no offense taken, if you were wondering.}
<C>__{sam}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{danny }
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{commander, from what i understand, if this thing goes to court, they won't need a lawyer, they'll need a priest.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{no. they'll need a lawyer.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{would you like me to take care of that?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{sure, if you feel like it.}
<A>__{jo takes another beat to size this guy up.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{one of the people you'll be speaking to down there is the barracks c.o., colonel nathan jessep, i assume you've heard of him.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{who hasn't?}

<D>__{this last letter to the naval investigative service }
<A>__{she hands it to kaffee who hands it to sam }
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ where he offers information about corporal dawson's fenceline shooting in exchange for a transfer, was just a last ditch effort.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{right. is that all?}
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{lieutenant, this letter makes it look like your client had a motive to kill santiago.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{gotcha.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and santiago is... who?}
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the victim.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{write that down.}
<P>__{(to jo)}
<D>__{am i correct in assuming that these letters don't paint a flattering picture of marine corps life in guantanamo bay?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{yes, among other }
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{and am i further right in assuming that a protracted investigation of this incident might cause some embarrassment for the security counsel guy.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{colonel jessep, yes, but }
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{twelve years.}

<D>__{you haven't talked to a witness, you haven't looked at a piece of paper.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{pretty impressive, huh?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{you're gonna have to go deeper than just }
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{commander, do you have some sort of jurisdiction here that i should know about?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{my job is to make sure you do your job. i'm special counsel for internal affairs, so my jurisdiction's pretty much in your face. read the letters. you're not under any obligation, but i'd appreciate a report when you get back from cuba.}

<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{kaffee gets up without waiting for jo to say }
