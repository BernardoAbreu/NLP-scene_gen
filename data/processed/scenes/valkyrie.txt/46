<L>__{interior the berghof conference room night}
<A>__{stauffenberg and fromm enter to the last thing we would expect. laughter. drunken laughter. pull back to reveal: the big six. hitler and five men some of them almost caricatures, their features so distinct. the first man we recognize as keitel the general who reamed fromm. the others we know from history and titles: minister albert speer architect for the new reich. dr. joseph goebbels reich minister of public}

<A>__{reich marshal hermann goering head of the german armed forces, hitler's second in command. we have arrived in the sanctum sanatorium of nazi germany on the day after the normandy invasion. but you would never know the tide of the war had just turned against germany. a series of situation maps are scattered before them, ignored. only speer seems to be reserved, smiling politely but clearly tuned into the present reality. looking closer at goering we see he is wearing heavy make up adding to the already surreal nature of the scene. it is also the first time we are allowed a clear, unobstructed view of hitler.}
<C>__{fromm}
<D>__{mein fuhrer... i wish to present colonel claus von stauffenberg our new chief of general staff for the replacement army.}
<A>__{the laughter stops. hitler and his cronies turn toward stauffenberg, looking him over. hitler stands and crosses to him. fromm meets him first, whispering in the fuhrer's ear perhaps reminding him who stauffenberg is. hitler nods: "ah yes." he takes stauffenberg's left hand with both of his. we are surprised by his charm.}
<C>__{hitler}
<D>__{may i say, i am honored to meet a hero who has sacrificed so much for germany. if only more of my officers were like you.}
<A>__{hitler's cronies smile despite the subtle insult to themselves. to make it worse, hitler turns to them.}
<C>__{hitler }
<D>__{let this man stand as an example to all of you. he is the ideal german officer.}
<A>__{fromm nervously clears his throat.}
<C>__{fromm}
<D>__{mein fuhrer, we have asked stauffenberg here today so that he might brief us on mobilizing troops from the home army to support those in normandy.}
<C>__{hitler}
<D>__{hmmm? oh yes, normandy. that will no longer be necessary. general goering has assured me that normandy is under control.}
<A>__{stauffenberg's good eye flickers. "are you insane? normandy is a catastrophe." another glance at the situation map shows allied forces over running. but the painted on smiles of hitler's nodding cronies promote the lie. no one has the courage to tell hitler anything close to the truth. somewhere in their eyes is the fear that someone will.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{mein fuhrer, if i may... the situation in normandy is }
<C>__{keitel}
<D>__{you're dismissed, stauffenberg.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{keitel}
<D>__{send your man home, fromm. then bring us some brandy.}
<A>__{fromm is stung a man of his rank being treated like a waiter. stauffenberg steps back, clicks his heels and salutes, just managing to say:}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{heil hitler.}
<A>__{hitler half waves, walking slowly back to his seat. fromm and stauffenberg leave.}
