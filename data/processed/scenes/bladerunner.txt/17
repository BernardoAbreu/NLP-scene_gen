<L>__{interior chop suey house night}
<A>__{a seamy as well as steamy little place. counter and small tables. old slant eyed enders humped over their fuming bowls jabbering and slurping. the only voice coming out clear is from the big three d tv on the back wall. as the mellow mouthed tv announcer delivers the message, a latin looking beauty in a well fitted maids uniform does a twirl, flashes a beguiling smile and glides out of frame.}
