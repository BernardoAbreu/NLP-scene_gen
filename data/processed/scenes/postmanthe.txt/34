<L>__{exterior cliff day}
<A>__{the postman, lungs heaving, stops his climb long enough to take stock of the army waiting on the distant river edge. strength ebbing, he heaves himself up and continues climbing.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior woods (eastern oregon) night}
<A>__{a chilling rain drills down, washing across an old forest road. covered with undergrowth and dotted with saplings, nothing's been down here in years. blue lipped and shivering, his clothes torn and soaked, the postman trudges along. he tries to rub some warmth back into his numbed limbs, but a coughing spell wracks his body. he trudges forward, shoes heavy with freezing mud. he's made his escape, but he won't last the night if he doesn't find some shelter. an unnatural shape ahead, just off the road. square. he cautiously pulls back a few branches. an old, rusted jeep with faded u.s. government markings. its hood buried under the dirt of an old mud slide. the postman stoops to look through the passenger side window, comes face to face with death. a skeleton sits inside, the skull grinning against the glass facing the postman. but the postman doesn't jump back. he just stares. the two heads meet halfway as the postman's face is reflected on the glass, superimposed over the skull. a hypothermic shiver wracks his body. the postman tries the door, but it won't budge. the other side of the jeep is buried. but seeing that the windshield is partly smashed, he clears away the debris, peels back the spider webbed safety glass and climbs inside.}
<B>__{jeep}
<A>__{pulling the glass back down, he looks almost shyly at the skeleton, like two kids about to "park" for the first time.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{hey. how ya doin'?}
<A>__{the back of the jeep is filled with bags marked u.s. mail. the postman picks up a hat off the console. oddly respectful, he runs a finger along the band over the "horse & rider" emblem. the postman reaches, touches the embroidered american flag patch on the skeleton's jacket shoulder. another shiver. a moment later, the postman is pulling the nice dry jacket off the skeleton and shoving his own arms inside. a sloshing sound. he pats down the jacket. finds a liquor. he gives the skeleton a "you shouldn't have" look. but the cap won't budge. he twists, pries, bangs the neck of the steering wheel. at last it gives. he takes a long, hard swallow. the warming fire streams down his throat. the postman grabs a random letter, reads it aloud.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{'jerry ball, pine view.'}
<A>__{he starts to open it, looks at the skeleton and shrugs.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{so, arrest me.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{here's a piece of good news. jerry's decided to go to school to get his contractor's license.}
<A>__{tossing it aside, he takes a drink, opens another. the words are in crayon a child's scrawl.}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(smiles to skeleton)}
<D>__{little jimmy wants his grandpa to know he lost a tooth.}
<A>__{the postman turns the envelope over in his palm. a tiny tooth falls out. the postman considers it. this suddenly isn't so amusing. he puts it back in the envelope. shoving mail sacks aside, he climbs in the back. burrowing in, he pulls the sacks back, covering himself with a blanket of mail. getting warmer already, he regards the skeleton a beat as the rain drums on the roof.}
