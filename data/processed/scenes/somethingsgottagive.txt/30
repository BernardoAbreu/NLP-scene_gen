<L>__{exterior beach moments later late .in the day}
<A>__{erica and harry walk by the water's edge. they are the only two people on the beach.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ did you know there are over eight thousand websites that mention you?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{that can't be possible.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, it's true. i know everything about you now. and not because of last night, but...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah, i understood. i actually looked you up too. you grew up in l.a., which i thought nobody did.}
<C>__{erica }
<D>__{you were the road manager for a group i sorta never heard of, started your own record label at 29, sold it at 45, then started buying and selling boutique companies then invested in a small record company which you turned into the 2nd largest hip hop label in the world.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's exhausting just hearing about it.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i know, but the truth is, it goes fast doesn't it?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{like the blink of an eye.}
<A>__{erica bends down and picks up a flat white stone, then another and another...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i noticed you have bowls of those all over your house.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i know, i'm crazy, i just think they're so beautiful...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{but why do you only pick up the white ones?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i don't only pick up the white ones.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, so you really are crazy.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i pick up only the white ones?}
<P>__{(looks in her hand)}
<D>__{oh, god, what does that mean? i'm controlling, unadventurous, what?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so you're as hard on yourself as you are on everyone else.}
<A>__{erica is stunned that he caught on to that. harry bends down, picks up a brown stone, places it in her palm among the white stones.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{something to remember me by.}
<A>__{erica realizes she can't sum this guy up so easily or at all.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{so can i ask you something harry? what's with all the young girls? i mean, what's the story there, really?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i just like to travel light.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you just like to travel light? oh, please, what the hell does that mean?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{now see a thirty year old gets that.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you mean falls for that.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i mean, accepts it.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{if that's what you want... a non threatening woman, who won't get your number, you get to run the show...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i think our relationship is growing by the way. have you noticed?}
<A>__{there he goes again. she can't believe he's cute like this.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm serious. maybe we just needed to get out of the house. now, you may notice, interestingly, we're walking back toward the house and its getting a little rocky again.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{of course it's getting a little rocky, we're talking about you.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{see, i will accept that slight hostility because i'm enjoying your company so much.}
<A>__{they're reached the bottom of the beach stairs. harry looks up, daunted.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, but i think i'11 stay down here and watch the sunset. you interested?}
<A>__{erica checks her watch.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{big dinner date?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{well, yeah, as a matter of fact. with your doctor.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ohhhhh, my doctor, 'cause he's not too young for you, huh?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{no, he's totally too young for me. but we're just having dinner. it's not a date.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{does he know that?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{well, i will tell him, but i doubt that he thinks of it that way.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i doubt that you doubt that. anyway, you may like it. think of it this way he's not threatening, won't get your number, you get to run the show. you might have a hell of a time.}
<A>__{over, we hear, ding dong. that night the front door swings open and we find julian. looking just as any girl would hope. dream date.}
<B>__{and on the other side of the door}
<A>__{is harry, in his robe and pj's.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{hey, look who's answering the door.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and look who's at the door.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{brought you something.}
<A>__{julian hands him a take out food box.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{a heart healthy dinner from our cafeteria.}
<C>__{erica }
<D>__{hello...}
<A>__{both guys turn at once. she looks beautiful, wearing a dress, probably the sexiest one she owns. no turtleneck tonight. julian walks to her, kisses her on the cheek.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{you look beautiful.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{behind julian's back harry gives erica the 'ok' sign.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(thrown)}
<D>__{we ready..?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{let me just see how harry's doing. it'll take two seconds. har, have a seat. .}
<A>__{angle harry sitting, self conscious in his new role the sick one. julian takes his wrist, feels his pulse. harry looks straight ahead. what he sees erica's legs as she sits right in front of him. she crosses her legs and her dress hikes up a little, exposing her thigh. julian furrows his brow.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what? that's not the face you want to see your doctor making.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{your pulse is a little fast but maybe you're just excited about something.}
<A>__{harry looks at erica's legs again.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i don't think so. i'm not excited about anything.}
<A>__{erica shifts, the hem of her skirt rising even higher.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{there it goes again. racing.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{doc... impossible!}
<A>__{erica rises, leaving harry's eye line.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{oh, there we go, now i feel better. back to normal.}
<A>__{harry winces then rises, looks to erica as she throws a pashmina over her shoulders in slow motion. harry rushes them}
<B>__{out the door.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{okay, all right, good, have fun, don't rush back for me and don't do anything i wouldn't do.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{well that wouldn't leave us too many options would it?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and do we wonder how she writes that snappy repartee.}
<P>__{(whispers to erica)}
<D>__{let him pick up the check. it'll make him feel older.}
<A>__{on erica's shocked expression, the door slams.}
