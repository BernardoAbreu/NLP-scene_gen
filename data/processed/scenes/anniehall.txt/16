<A>__{alvy stands in front of glass doors of theater, the ticket taker behind him just inside the glass doors. the sounds of city traffic, car horns honking, can be heard while he looks around waiting for, annie. a man in a black leather jacket, walking past the theater, stops in front of, alvy. he looks at him, then moves away. he stops a few steps farther and turns around to look at alvy again. alvy looks away, then back at the man. the man continues to stare. alvy scratches his head, looking for annie and trying not to notice the man. the man, still staring, walks back to alvy.}
