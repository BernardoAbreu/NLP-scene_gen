<A>__{a harsh door buzzer. duke jerks awake. alone. looking like shit. around him is the wreckage of their stay.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{the decision to flee came suddenly. or maybe not.}
<A>__{duke opens the door to a bell boy with a trolley load of fruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.}
<C>__{bell boy}
<D>__{room service!}
<A>__{the bell boy wheels the trolley across the room already stacked with even more boxes of goodies.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{maybe i'd planned it all along subconsciously waiting for the right moment. the bill was a factor, i think. because i had no money to pay for it.}
<A>__{duke slams the door starts frantically packing.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{our room service tabs had been running somewhere between $29 and $36 per hour, for forty eight consecutive hours. incredible. how could it happen?}
<A>__{duke sees the discarded wrappings of expensive, hand tooled luggage. a sudden thought. he rushes to gonzo's room empty. his plastic briefcase remains on the bed...}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{but by the time i asked this question, there was no one around to answer.}
<A>__{duke opens the briefcase finds the .357 magnum inside.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{my attorney was gone. he must have sensed trouble.}
