<L>__{interior mother superior's office}
<A>__{the office is bare and austere. mother superior sits at her desk with her hands folded. like all the nuns at the convent, she wears the traditional full length habit and wimple. mother superior is in total command of all she surveys, and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as she rules. control is her passion; within the walls of the convent, she has created a world she can trust because it's a world she controls.}
<D>__{but mother superior is not in control at this particular moment. bishop george o'hara stands before her with a majestic presence and some bad news.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{absolutely not. i am very sorry, but no.}
<C>__{o'hara}
<D>__{we can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite all in one gesture.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{but she's been exposed to the underside of life. she is the underside of life.}
<C>__{o'hara}
<D>__{and therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{we're a small convent, bishop. surely there are... more appropriate shelters.}
<C>__{o'hara}
<D>__{your small convent is in danger of closing, reverend mother. the las vegas police department has offered to make a generous financial donation.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{but, bishop...}
<C>__{o'hara}
<D>__{st. katherine's is a benedictine order. you have taken a vow of hospitality. to all in need.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{i lied.}
<C>__{o'hara}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<A>__{mother superior's jaw locks. she realizes she is stuck with the situation and will have to control it as best she can. there is a knock at the door, and eddie and christy enter.}
<C>__{o'hara}
<D>__{welcome, lieutenant. everything is in order.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{aces. bishop maybe a cup of coffee, down at the corner?}
<A>__{the thought of being left alone with mother superior panics christy, like a child left in the principal's office.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{hey, you're not leaving me alone...}
<C>__{o'hara}
<P>__{(reassuringly)}
<D>__{you're never alone in this house, my child.}
<A>__{eddie touches her gently on the arm.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{one month, two tops. behave yourself.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{bishop...}
<P>__{(a last ditch attempt)}
<C>__{o'hara}
<P>__{(opening the door to leave)}
<D>__{lieutenant?}
