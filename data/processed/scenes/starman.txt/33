<C>__{fox}
<D>__{is there any possibility that it's a hoax? could you be mistaken?}

<D>__{none. and there's another one in the area that's alive. i don't know if it's the only one. i don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{get the body out of there. load it on the air force chopper and get it to wright patterson. they'll take it from there... we didn't expect this, shermin.}
