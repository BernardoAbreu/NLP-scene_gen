<A>__{there are three lines set up with several participants. it is a relay race, with the baton replaced by a tray full of drinks in paper cups, water. the colors indicate again concessions, guards and grounds. the race is already in full swing, with concessions in the lead. the last group of relayers are now getting their trays, and concessions is way ahead. everyone is cheering their team on. the final pass is made to sarah who works for aokee's. she takes the tray and moves gracefully to the final stop. there is a small table on which the drinks must be placed. she is clearly going to win when she suddenly stops. all concessions kids are shocked and plead her to go on. she does a nifty and graceful around the back maneuver with the tray, proceeds to the table, and sets down the drinks, tipping the tray sideways to show no water has been spilled. the judges scribble furiously.}
