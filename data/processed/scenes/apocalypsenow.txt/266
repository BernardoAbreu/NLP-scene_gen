<A>__{willard walks along the top of a thick wall sandbagged and dug out every so often for an m 60 or a mortar emplacement. wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow to willard as he passes.}

<A>__{a woman tentatively moves to willard, bowing, and then runs off to her bunker. we are tracking with them as they move past the groups of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and children. skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from every hut adorn every sandbagged bunker dried scalps hang from barbed wire. a child is chewing on a big piece of almost raw meat.}
