<L>__{interior hell creek bar and grill, jordan, mt night}
<A>__{theyre only halfway through the entree, but grant is ready to bolt. it's only billy who's keeping him from being rude. they walk over to paul and amandas table and sit down.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{first off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, amanda and i have admired your work for years.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{it is truly, whats the word? inspiring.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{it's everything grant can do just to be polite. he desperately wants to leave and get back to his dig.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{amanda and i, well, we just love the outdoors. heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: galapagos, k2, the nile...}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{we even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.}
<A>__{billy nudges grant.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{hmmm.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...}
<A>__{he places his hand on his wife's.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{...once in a lifetime.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over isla sorna. and we want you to be our guide.}
<A>__{the kirby's look to grant as if they've offered him an amazing gift. but grant just sighs and smooths the tablecloth.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{that's a very nice offer, mr. kirby, but i'm afraid i'm much to busy. if you like i can refer you to a number of highly qualified...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, no, see dr. grant, you're the best. you've seen these animals in the flesh. no one else has come close to you.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i'm flattered, but i've taken this little adventure tour. and with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in san diego, you cant fly low enough to see anything of interest.}
<A>__{paul is momentarily stymied, but amanda rallies.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{you see, that's just the thing. paul and i have special permission to fly low.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{how low?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, i'm no aviation specialist. but i do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{from what i understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{that's hard to believe.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{let's just say that through my business imports exports, emerging markets i've made some friends in high places. in this case, the costa rican government.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{dr. grant, you don't know how important it is for us to have you come along. it would make all the difference.}
<A>__{grant is trying to find another way to say no, when paul pulls out his checkbook.}
<C>__{pual}
<D>__{and of course, we're prepared to make a sizeable contribution to your research here.}
<A>__{billy looks at grant. don't say no.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{i can write all kinds of numbers on this check. just tell me what exactly it would take.}
<A>__{we hold on a conflicted dr. alan grant.}
