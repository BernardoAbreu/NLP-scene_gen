<A>__{the fuji maru cruises through rain lashed waters. accompanied by a very scary musical score. then suddenly, in the extreme foreground, air bubbles angrily gurgle to the surface. then a wave explodes, as if thrashed from below. then another wave explodes, forty feet to the right. then another, eighty feet to the left. and then almost seen: huge, black, ominous things seem to be squirming beneath the water. heading for the fuji maru.}
