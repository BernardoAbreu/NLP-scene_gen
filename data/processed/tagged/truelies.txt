<L>__{exterior mountains, near geneva, switzerland night}
<A>__{the snow covered alps stand out clearly in the light of a full moon. a fortress like chateau is situated in a flat saddle of forest partway up the mountain, next to a frozen lake. the property is surrounded by high stone walls, and the stately grounds are bathed in floodlights and patrolled by armed guards with dogs.}
<L>__{exterior chateau night}
<A>__{the driveway and motorcourt are filled with cars. a formal dress party is in progress... a private reception for a middle eastern dignitary. tuxedoes men escort their diamond encrusted ladies through the huge front doors, where they doff their overcoats and are politely scanned with hand held metal detectors by white gloved security staffers. the walled perimeter of the house runs along the lake, forming a kind of rampart. there is an opening, to a kind of waterway or canal, which connects to the private docks inside the grounds. there is a steel grating across the opening. the bars disappear down into the thin ice of early winter. with the house visible bg, we crane down below the parapet wall along which a guard is a white exposure suit is walking... down along the dark wall to the grating... tilting down to see a glow pulsing under the ice.}
<L>__{exterior beneath the ice, underwater night}
<A>__{camera moving toward: a figure in diving gear working at the metal bars with an oxygen arc cutting torch. one bar has already been cut out. two quick cuts and a second bar falls to the muddy bottom. lit now only from the floodlights filtering down through the ice, the figure slips through the bars and swims powerfully along the stone canal wall. seem from below, the figure is a black shadow moving against the rippled glass of the ice above.}
<L>__{exterior canal and boathouse night}
<A>__{a dock extends into the frozen canal, just behind a large boathouse. there is a faint chipping sound. the ice breaks quietly, and the pieces are slid back. a head appears, in a rubber drysuit hood. the diver slips the regulator out of his mouth and turns slowly, scanning... revealing: harry tasker. our hero. harry floats with just his eyes above the surface, silent as a water snake, as a guard passes on a footpath nearby. after a few beats harry slips out of his tanks and fins, letting them sink, and climbs the frozen ladder onto the dock. he moves like a ninja into the shadows of the boathouse. opening a waterproof bag, he pulls out a walky talky.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{honey, i'm home.}
<L>__{interior exterior surveillance van, mountain road night}
<A>__{meet harry's partner, albert "gib" gibson, an overweight twenty year man with a lived in looking face. gib answers harry via his headset.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{roger that.}
<P>__{(he covers the mike and turns)}
<D>__{hey, fize! get your butt in here. harry's inside.}
<A>__{outside, fast faisil, an iranian american, finishes making yellow snow and hurries back to the van. they are parked on a winding mountain road a half mile from the chateau, whose lights are visible through the trees. faisil jumps in and goes to the eyepiece of a huge telephoto nightvision scope. the eerie green image lurches as he sweeps the grounds, locating the boathouse.}
<L>__{exterior boathouse night}
<A>__{concealed in the shadows, harry is shucking out of his drysuit. underneath is he is wearing black tux pants, suspenders, cummerbund and a formal shirt. he puts a tiny plug, like a hearing aid, deep in his ear canal. a sub vocal transceiver. very advanced.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{switching to sub vocal. gib, you copy?}
<C>__{gib }
<D>__{it's talkradio. you're on the air.}
<A>__{harry slips into his shoulder harness... holster on one side, containing his .45 auto glock 22, and the transmitter pack for the ear piece slung on the other. he slips on a formal jacket, concealing the rig. then a final touch. a little aftershave from a tiny plastic vial. harry adjusts his bow tie and strides confidently out of the shadows, crossing quickly to the main house. he looks ultrasharp in his black tux with the white silk cummerbund and his hair slicked back. he enters the main house through a back service entrance.}
<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{harry strides through the huge kitchen like he owns the place. the kitchen staff are scurrying around, too busy to really notice. he finger tastes a dish as he passes.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(french subtitled)}
<D>__{this needs more garlic.}
<A>__{he breezes through unchallenged, exiting into the }
<L>__{interior main hall night}
<A>__{here the party is in full swing. harry blends smoothly into the crowd of foreign dignitaries, businessman and minor mid east nobility. they are a high octane mixture of new oil money and old european money, and run the spectrum from stodgy bankers to playboy arms dealers. harry strolls amiably among the glittering woman, the cigar smoking men, casually snagging a glass of champagne and a canape from the passing waiters. he nods to someone as if he knows them. greets another is quite fluent arabic. people in his wake look at each other like "do you know him?" they shrug, go on with their conversation. harry moves through the crowd. scanning.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{there's daddy petrobucks.}
<A>__{harry's pov through the crowd is sees jamal khaled, the host of the party and owner of the chateau. he is fat and animated, greeting guests with a flourish. as harry watches he warmly greets a beautiful woman. they become absorbed in a conversation. the woman glances up and sees harry checking her out. there is a frank moment of returned interest. then the crowd shifts, cutting off their view of each other.}
<L>__{interior staircase and second floor night}
<A>__{harry makes his way up the grand staircase to the second floor. he slips through doors into the private area of the mansion.}
<L>__{interior library night}
<A>__{the doors open and harry slips into the darkened library. he crosses quickly to a window and opens it onto a terrace.}
<L>__{exterior balconies night}
<A>__{harry goes onto the terrace, and in a display of acrobatic prowess, he pulls himself up onto the third floor balcony directly above. he lets himself into }
<L>__{interior khaled's office night}
<A>__{khaled's office is ornately furnished. beautiful antiques glint in the moonlight coming in the french doors. harry crosses to an immense desk and boots up the computer there. bathed in the glow from the screen, he pulls a flat box, about the size of a paperback, from the back of his cummerbund. he connects it quickly to the modem port in the back of the computer.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{modem in place. transmitting... now.}
<A>__{he pushes a button and a green light comes on.}
<L>__{interior van night}
<A>__{gib and faisil watch as their monitor screen lights with data from khaled's private computer.}
<C>__{faisil}
<D>__{affirmatory. we are in.}
<A>__{fast faisil is a computer ace. his fingers fly on the keyboard as he types rapid key commands. we see familiar "windows appear". the words are all in arabic characters.}
<C>__{faisil}
<D>__{these are encrypted files, guys. this is going to take me a few minutes.}
<L>__{14 interior 2nd floor hallway night}
<A>__{tight on library door. it opens a crack and a dental mirror comes out, looking around like a u boat periscope. seeing the coast is clear harry slips out. but just as he is closing the door, a guard rounds the corner ten feet away. harry turns smoothly. he smiles sheepishly and moves toward the guard.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(in arabic subtitled)}
<D>__{where's the john around here? i have to take a major leak.}
<A>__{the guard points warily down the corridor. harry nods and heads that way, back toward the party.}
<L>__{interior main hall staircase night}
<A>__{harry comes down the staircase amid the glitter of the party. he is sipping champagne and looking bored. he sees two security guys moving purposefully through the crowd toward the stairs, walkies in their hands. he turns away as they pass him and pretends to study a large fragment of bas relief... a temple frieze depicting a war chariot drawn by four horses. he senses someone next to him and turns. it is the woman. she is captivatingly beautiful, and her gaze is piercing.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(indicating the bas relief)}
<D>__{magnificent, isn't it?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{yes. hi, i'm juno skinner. i thought i knew most of khaled's friends but i don't believe i know you.}
<A>__{harry offers his hand to her.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{renquist. harry renquist.}
<L>__{interior van night}
<A>__{gib whirls to the screen displaying the mission database. he scans rapidly for }
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{skinner. skinner. come on...}
<A>__{gib finds the entry he's looking for. juno's picture and data appear on the screen.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{juno skinner. art and antiquities dealer, specializing in ancient persia.}
<L>__{interior main hall night}
<A>__{harry turns back to the fragment of frieze.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{this is persian, if i'm not mistaken.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{very good. it's sixth century b.c. do you like the period?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(shameless)}
<D>__{i adore it.}
<L>__{exterior dock boathouse (nightvision pov) night}
<A>__{seen through the starlight scope, we see one of the guards shining his light on the hole in the ice and then on harry's footprints leading to the boathouse. he calls to one of the other guards, who comes running over.}
<L>__{interior mansion night}
<A>__{harry, still with juno, hears gib in his ear:}
<C>__{gib }
<D>__{harry, we got a problem. guards are swarming all over the dock.}
<A>__{harry glances up the stairs. khaled's security chief is gesturing to several of his men, and speaking quickly into a walky. three security men come down the stairs, scanning the crowd. harry turns smoothly away from them and takes juno's arm.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{do you dance, ms. skinner?}
<A>__{he steers her toward the dance floor.}
<L>__{interior van night}
<A>__{gib, listening, rolls his eyes. he looks through the night vision scope. guards are running around outside the chateau. harry's stirred up the hornet's nest. faisil is still jamming at the keyboard.}
<C>__{faisil}
<D>__{okay, files are unlocked. i'm in. i'm down, baby. i got my hand up her dress and i'm going for the gold. i'm }
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{just copy the goddamn files!}
<P>__{(into his headset)}
<D>__{harry, don't be stopping to smell the roses, now. you hear me, harry?}
<L>__{interior main hall night}
<A>__{harry whirls juno aggressively across the dancefloor. she responds deftly. they are well matched. she parries each of his smooth moves with a flourish. it is a contest of wills, and a surprised appraisal for each that the other is worthy. juno is hot. he bends her back at the waist, then snaps her up. she twirls into the crook of his arm. their faces are inches apart. wow. the music ends and she gives him a wry grin.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{well. and i thought this was going to be just another bunch of boring bankers and oil billionaires.}
<C>__{gib }
<D>__{harry, seconds count, buddy. ditch the bitch, let's go.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{unfortunately, juno, i have a plane to catch.}
<A>__{she slips a card out of a pocket in her otherwise sheer dress. she hands it to him, maintaining eye contact. serious sparks.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'd like that.}
<L>__{interior van night}
<A>__{gib can't believe this conversation.}
<C>__{gib}
<P>__{(to faisil)}
<D>__{son of a bitch is with her two minutes and she's ready to bear his children}
<P>__{(to harry)}
<D>__{what's your exit strategy twinkle toes?}
<L>__{exterior chateau front entrance night}
<A>__{harry nods to the security men at the door as he strides confidently through. he goes down the steps to the broad terrace above the motor court. behind harry, a guard lowers his walky talky and starts after him.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{may i see your invitation, sir?}
<A>__{without turning, harry slips a small flat box out of his breast pocket. a remote detonator.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{here's my invitation.}
<A>__{he pushes the button and kaboom! the second floor office windows blow out in a fiery explosion. using the diversion, harry leaps off the terrace before the guard can open fire.}
<L>__{interior exterior van night}
<A>__{gib sees the rising fireball a half mile away. he starts the van.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{aw, shit. here we go }
<L>__{exterior chateau and grounds night}
<A>__{harry sprints across the snow covered lawn, through the trees. guards with automatic weapons run after him, firing. the snow explodes around him with bullet hits. two dobermans pelt toward harry, leaping at him in perfect unison. he waits... and knocks their heads together in mid leap with a crack like a baseball bat. the dogs drop to the snow, wobbling around like they're drunk. as harry sprints on, another doberman lunges out of the bushes ahead, leaping directly for his throat. harry grabs the dog and shot puts him up into a tree without breaking stride. dog fu. the dog yelps and scrambles to hold onto an icy branch, looking down in amazement.}
<L>__{exterior perimeter wall mountain slope night}
<A>__{harry leaps down on the outside of the wall, hitting a snow bank and sliding downhill. he sprints down the gentle slope toward the highway. harry looks back as two guards on skis come out of a guard station beside the main entrance. tracking with the ski guards, searching through the trees with lights. they have lost harry. they stop. a snowbank behind them explodes as harry leaps out. he disables them both with vicious street fighter moves. harry looks upslope as a service gate opens in the perimeter wall and teams of security men in white snow suits pour out, some on skis, some on snowmobiles. a helicopter rises over the wall in a blast of swirling snow. its xenon lights rake through the trees, casting lurid wheeling shadows on the snow. on harry, snapping closed the ski boots he has stolen from one of the disabled guards. he pops the boots quickly into the bindings and takes off downhill with one of the guard's fn fal rifles slung across his back. the helicopter swoops downhill, its searchlight blazing through the forest. snowmobile headlights illuminate the ski patrols zig zagging among the trees. harry slashes expertly downhill. he cuts a distinguished figure in his black tux. automatic weapons fire rips through the trees from behind him. harry is going flat out. the xenon light hits him. a 7.62 mm machine gun in the chopper rips the slope into white clouds around him. harry slashes, turns, weaving among the trees at breakneck speed. a snowmobile is closing in, outflanking him. he turns toward it, suddenly. hits a mogul. uses the air to slash his skis right across the rider's face. the snowmobile crashes and tumbles into the night.}
<L>__{interior exterior van mountain road night}
<A>__{gib's van takes an icy turn in a hairy slide. inside gib is peering upslope, trying to see what's going on. all he can see are lights and gunfire.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{harry, what's your twenty? i need a position, buddy }
<A>__{suddenly a skier in a black tux launches across the road from the slope above, right over the van, and lands deftly downslope.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{uh... right! i will catch you on the next bend.}
<A>__{behind the van, pursuing guards leap across the road. only about half can make the jump. the rest crash horribly. the helicopter thunders overhead.}
<L>__{exterior mountain slope night}
<A>__{harry sees the chopper start an attack run. he comes out into the open, going straight downhill like a rocket. the chopper gets suckered in... trying to hit him, getting right down behind him... and suddenly harry slides to a stop in an explosion of powder and whips up the rifle. p p p pow! he rakes a burst across the windshield. the startled pilot swerves and suddenly two tall pine trees are right in front of him. k whack! the main rotor blade snaps clean off and the chopper drops into the snow, plowing into a snowbank. it slides right to the edge of a steep ridge and stops, teetering. firing from a snowmobile, one of the guards puts a burst right across harry's path. harry's skis are hit and he tumbles, comes out of it... running down the hill like a juggernaut in his heavy boots. he has lost the rifle somewhere in the snow. harry takes cover behind the burning wreck of the downed chopper, which still has its engine running. the ski patrol opens fire from upslope. rounds whacking against the disabled helicopter. harry looks down the slope and gets an idea. he jerks the unconscious pilot out and pushes on the fuselage, rocking it. it slips over the edge. he leaps inside as it topples forward and slides down the slope.}
<L>__{interior exterior helicopter mountain slope night}
<A>__{harry adds throttle and works the footpedals, using the tail rotor to steer. the chopper had snow skids, and harry is skiing the damn thing down the mountain. the copter is burning as it rockets down the slope on its skids. bullets are hitting the fuselage, and everything around it. skiers are wiping out, hitting trees. a snowmobile hits a rock and flies spectacularly into a ravine.}
<C>__{gib }
<D>__{harry! where are you!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{in the helicopter.}
<L>__{interior exterior van mountain road night}
<A>__{gib slides the van around a curve.}
<C>__{gib}
<P>__{(deadpan, to faisil)}
<D>__{he's in the helicopter.}
<A>__{big is scanning above for the chopper. then upslope he sees the burning fuselage skiing expertly among the trees. the chopper hits a jump and launches into the air it crashes through trees, still soaring and gib looks up, screaming as the chopper drops right toward him he hits the brakes and blammo! it drops onto the road ten feet in front of the skidding van... then slides over the edge and tumbles into a rocky canyon where is blows up! the fireball lights up the night. gib and faisil jump out of the van. they look downslope at the burning wreckage.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{harry? harry?!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{gib and faisil spin to look behind them. harry is lodged in tree branches hanging over the road. gib hands his mp 5k machine gun to faisil and reaches up to harry, who grabs his hand and pulls. harry tumbles down into the snowbank. he stands, brushing snow off his tux, and clomps toward the van in his ski boots. he is completely unruffled.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{let's go. we can still make our flight.}
<A>__{as faisil is getting into the van behind harry, two guard teams on snowmobiles roar around the bend behind them, fish tailing on the ice. faisil opens fire. one snowmobile swerves over the embankment. the other pulls up broadside, and the guards duck behind it. gib floors it and the van roars down the mountain. faisil is still ramboing on full auto.}

<C>__{gib}
<D>__{yep. sleep fast.}
<L>__{interior tasker house night}
<A>__{harry slips inside. he sets down his suitcase and walks quietly down the hall. he pauses at a door with lurid labels and stickers plastered all over it (toxic waste, stay out!, if it's too loud you're too old, etc.) harry silently opens the door and looks in at his sleeping daughter, dana. she looks like an angel in the moonlight coming in the window. in fact, she is a typical 14 year old girl, and therefore hardly an angel. but to harry she is unflawed.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{harry, undressed now, slips into bed next to... a lump in the covers which we presume to be a human being. this is helen tasker, harry's wife of 15 years. he kisses her on the cheek and she stirs. she rolls toward him, giving him a sleepy hug and a kiss.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(a drowsy murmur)}
<D>__{hi, honey. how was the flight?}
<C>__{harry}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{dana, don't forget to feed gizmo!}
<A>__{harry crosses the bedroom, hurrying past helen who is clearly rushing to get ready herself. we get our first good look at helen. she is wearing a terrycloth robe as she picks out an outfit. her hair is wrapped in a towel. to call her plain would be inaccurate. she could be attractive if she put any effort into it, which doesn't occur to her.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm late.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{me too.}
<A>__{they talk without looking at each other, the way people who have been together a long time do.}

<D>__{how'd it go at the trade show? you make all the other salesmen jealous?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah. you should have seen it. we were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...}

<C>__{gib}
<D>__{come any closer i will kill you.}
<A>__{the dog backs up, whining plaintively. gib throws his jacket over the back of the couch and then, inexplicably, he takes out a pack of camels and sets it on the mantelpiece. he adjusts its position carefully. hmmmm.}

<D>__{thanks dear.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{here, check these out.}
<A>__{gib hands harry the glasses. harry studies them, seeing the virtual video display inside the left lens of the ray bans. harry glances down the hall, making sure no one is looking, then he puts them on. harry's pov inside the glasses a black and white video image of his own living room.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{the ccd camera and transmitter and inside a pack of smokes. slick little unit, huh?}

<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i agree.}

<A>__{harry can't answer because mahmoud just entered the room behind him. harry is at one of the urinals, apparently taking a leak. mahmoud goes to the mirror. starts combing his hair. he doesn't much notice the pack of camels sitting on the counter nearby. harry is whistling. shaking himself. harry's pov in the video glasses harry sees himself and mahmoud. yusif comes into the restroom, seemingly ignoring both harry and mahmoud, as if heading for the stalls. as he passes behind harry he reaches into his coat harry spins lightning fast. he knocks away the silenced pistol aimed at the back of his head with a sweeping block, capturing yusif's arm in an arm lock. the shot goes wide, shattering a urinal. harry slams his palm into yusif's face like a piledriver, and spins him against the steel stalls. the silenced pistol goes skittering across the floor. mahmoud whips a pistol out of his waistband. still holding the bear like yusif, harry draws his glock so fast we can barely see him move. blam! blam! blam! three .45 slugs go through mahmoud's chest, shattering the mirror behind him. he flops on his butt, slumping against the wall. yusif, who is easily harry's size, bellows and grabs his gun arm. they smash against the walls, struggling for the gun. yusif, locked to harry, hurls him against the stalls. they hit a locked door, which pops open, banging inward. yusif drives harry to the floor. harry's head is between the shoes of an old guy sitting on the can, who looks down uncomprehendingly at him. yusif slams harry's gun hand repeatedly against the doorframe of the stall. he twists harry's wrist brutally. he even pounds against harry's hand with his knee. the old guy winces. that's got to hurt. harry cries out in pain and the gun drops. yusif reaches for it, but harry kicks it under the stalls. he punches yusif in the face, driving him back. they grapple, spinning. harry drives yusif's head into the counter. then he elbows him in the throat and they crash together on the filthy floor. harry grabs yusif's hair and pounds his face repeatedly against the rim of a urinal. in case you haven't noticed, this is a messy, nasty fight. survival is like that. yusif sags into submission. harry pulls a nylon zip strip out of his pocket and uses it like hand cuffs, securing yusif's wrists.}

<C>__{helen}
<D>__{do you have an envelope for doris?}

<D>__{no. he has particular tastes. he likes to watch. you will say his regular girl, carla, is sick. if he likes you, he will tell you what to do. you must plant the bug near the telephone, by the bed, before you leave. if you do not accomplish your mission, the deal is off.}
<L>__{interior hotel tenth floor night}
<A>__{helen exits an elevator and walks down the long hallway toward the suite. she stops by a mirror and checks her look. decides she is too uptown. she pulls the neckline of her dress down so it shows more shoulder, then hitches up the hem. ditches the pearls. puts on some red lipstick. now she doesn't look hot and elegant... just hot. she practices a slinky walk, getting into the role. suddenly she remembers her wedding ring. she pulls on it. it probably hasn't been off in years. she licks her finger and twists it off. yoww! she puts it on her right hand and turns the modest diamond palm side in . . . out of site. then, reading the number off the key, she goes to the room and unlocks the door.}
<L>__{interior suite night}
<A>__{helen comes in hesitantly. the lights are off. the suite is large and richly furnished, with a breathtaking view of the city. it is the room harry was using, posing as renquist. a french accented voice comes from the next room.}

<A>__{she goes into the bedroom. there is a dark figure sitting in a chair, just a silhouette.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{step into the light.}
<A>__{it is a corner room. the drapes on one side are closed, shadowing the man, but open on the other just enough to let in a slash of moonlight. she steps forward into it. tight close up on the figure. we can just make out that it is harry, though helen cannot. tilt down to show his hand, out of sight behind the chair arm, as he manipulates the pause button on the dat tape deck.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm michelle. carla's sick. she thought you might like me, so }
<A>__{harry goes sssshhhh. silencing her gently. he silently clicks off the pause button. the dat recorder plays. charles boyer, deep and hypnotic, speaks from harry's outline. harry lipsynchs.}

<A>__{helen turns her back to him, and draws the zipper down languorously, revealing her creamy back. she is not wearing a bra.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{now slip the dress down... slowly.}
<A>__{helen is starting to get into the ritual. she lets the dress slip off her shoulders. it slides down her body to the floor. she steps out of it, still in high heels.}

<C>__{harry }
<D>__{that's good. now the panties.}

<D>__{now turn, cheri, in the moonlight. let your body flow like water.}
<A>__{she turns. her skin is beautiful in the silvery light.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{now dance for me. go on.}
<A>__{helen has no idea what to do, but she improvises quite well. the scrutiny of the shadowed man, who is fully clothed, and her raw vulnerability are a quiveringly powerful erotic combination.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{let your hands be a lover's hands on your own skin as you move. yes, that's it.}
<A>__{tight on harry's eyes as he studies her. his game, meant to give her a dangerous fantasy, is actually turning him on mightily. he is amazed to see her playing the role, getting into it. this is not the helen is thought he knew for sixteen years.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{now, lie on the bed and close your eyes.}
<A>__{she does. harry rises and goes to her, bringing the tape deck.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{keep them closed. do not open them.}
<A>__{he sits on the bed, next to her, but without touching her. he strokes her hair, lovingly. then runs his fingertips over her eyes, down her cheeks. to her it feels delicate and delicious. part of her is enjoying this a lot. but helen is torn between wanting to flee and knowing that nothing the man has done so far is enough to cause her to abort her mission.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i thought you only liked to watch.}
<A>__{harry goes ssshhh. it's all he can do. he bends over her and brings his lips slowly down to her. he touches them to hers so slowly that she barely knows he is kissing her. then he takes her in a passionate kiss. and she grabs the lamp on the bedside table and smashes it over his head. harry flies off onto the floor, groaning and semiconscious. helen flips on the light and grabs her clothes, starting to dress rapidly. she still doesn't recognize harry, who is face down. he groans and starts to rise. she kicks him in the ribs and finishes putting her dress on. she sticks the bug under the night table and grabs her shoes. mission accomplished, motherfuckers. harry grabs her ankle. she raises one shoe to kosh him again, and sees who it is. freezeframe. total shock. she can't even form the question.}

<D>__{harry ?!}
<L>__{interior suite door night}
<A>__{crash!! the door lock is shattered by tremendous force and three men burst into the room. we may recognize them as workers from juno's shop. they are wielding pistols and are clearly part of malik's terrorist brigade. harry is still groggy, and he doesn't want to start anything with helen there, and risk her getting shot. he acquiesces as they pull him to his feet.}

<D>__{if i break it they can take it out of my pay.}
<L>__{interior harrier day}
<A>__{harry doesn't have a g suit or a helmet of anything. he just has his walky on his belt. inside the cramped cockpit, harry looks around for the lever which vectors the thrust. finds it, and sets it to 90 degrees (vertical). he bangs the canopy closed and brings the throttle up to full.}
<C>__{gib}
<P>__{(to pilot)}
<D>__{it'll be fine. he's got hundreds of hours in harriers. joint ops, cross training and all that.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{harry can fly anything.}
<A>__{the big plane wobbles off the ground like a drunken bumble bee.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{he's a little rusty. it's like riding a bicycle . . . you never forget. uh . . . i'd seek shelter!}
<A>__{it drifts sideways and everybody runs to get out of the way. at about six feet above the ground it slides sideways, clips the top of a cop car and knocks off the light bar. it lifts unsteadily straight into the sky. it turns around 180.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{he's got it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{harry pushes the vector lever forward and the thrust nozzles turn, accelerating the plane forward.}

<A>__{the plane disappears toward miami.}
<L>__{exterior high rise miami day}
<A>__{an aerial shot, circling the building. it is an unfinished building in the high rise district. the aerospatiale sits on the roof, its rotor turning slowly. the street below is jammed with cars. honking horns echo up the glass canyons.}

<A>__{angle at streetlevel as cops use bullhorns and bad attitudes to clear the street around the building, setting up a perimeter two blocks away.}
<L>__{interior high rise day}
<A>__{inside the high rise the terrorists have barricaded themselves on the twentieth floor. there are 12 terrorists, all with automatic weapons. occasionally one of them will fire a burst down a stairwell with an ak 47. miami dade swat team members are deployed in the stairwell but are keeping their distance.}
<L>__{interior high rise on the 21st floor day}
<A>__{malik is sequestered with the bomb. it sits on the floor, still in its shipping case. dana stands nearby, looking scares. she is not ties up. where can she go? she watches malik go to the warhead and insert his arming key. he has a tv set up on some crates, and we see that his video tapes demands are running on cnn. harry's face fills the screen, verifying the the nuclear weapons as a real threat. he is identified at the bottom of the screen as harry tasker, atomic energy commission. dana stares at her father's face on the national news. it's like a bad dream. she has been crying but she is fairly composed now.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{i have to go to the bathroom.}
<A>__{the terrorists ignore her. a terrified action news reporter and his cameraman, under guard by two terrorists, are hastily setting up to shoot malik.}

<D>__{tape is rolling.}
<C>__{malik}
<D>__{this is a communique from crimson jihad. you have heard from your own expert. you have seen the holy fire with your own eyes. do not force us to destroy this city. and do not try to use force against us. i can trigger this bomb instantly. all i have to do is turn that key...}

<D>__{what key?}
<C>__{malik}
<P>__{(pointing like the guy's blind)}

<A>__{malik looks down. the key is gone.}
<C>__{malik}
<P>__{(to his men)}
<D>__{someone has stolen the key!}
<A>__{he turns, looking around wildly. malik then sees dana running for the stairwell to the roof. he pulls a pistol and shoots at her, but hits the wall as she bangs through the door. he runs after her.}
<L>__{exterior building roof day}
<A>__{on the roof, malik bursts through the stairwell door. his two men have followed him. malik stops suddenly when he sees dana standing at the edge of the roof. she is holding the arming key by its chain. dangling it over the edge. he signals to his men not to fire.}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(terrified, but thinking)}
<D>__{you shoot me, this'll fall.}
<A>__{malik advances slowly, his eyes glistening ferally. she backs up a step with each of his, moving along the edge of the roof. malik keeps his pistol aimed at her chest.}

<C>__{malik}
<D>__{if you drop it, i will have no reason not to kill you.}

<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{don't you want to live? i give you my word.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{no way you whacko.}
<A>__{she reaches the corner of the building. her back touches something. it is the boom of a small crane, used for lifting building supplies. careful to keep the key dangling over open space, dana climbs up on the lattice work boom and moves out beyond the edge of the building, never taking her eyes off malik. she is hyperventilating, terrified, but thinking clearly. malik steps up on the crane, crawling out after her. he knows she will not drop the key as long as he has the gun. it is a game which will end when she reaches the end of the boom. dana puts the key between her teeth so she can hang on better. it is windy and the boom is swinging.}

<A>__{the crimson jihad warriors hear a thunderous, shrieking roar and look toward the window.}
<L>__{exterior high rise day}
<A>__{rising into view, like a gargoyle from hell, is the harrier. it fills the windows completely, hovering only a few feet outside. the terrorists raise their ak 47s to fire just as harry hits the 20mm nose cannon.}

<A>__{malik's two remaining men run to the helicopter, gesticulating to the pilot to get ready to take off. the pilot revs the turbine and the rotor whirls faster. the two men jump in, picking up m 60 machine guns.}
<L>__{exterior roof crane boom day}
<A>__{malik is still advancing out the crane boom. dana slips as she backs up, toppling off the boom. she is hanging now by her hands over a 20 story drop. malik is almost to her. he needs a hand free to grab her. he sets his gun down on the girder. he grabs for her wrist.}

<A>__{harry has the canopy up. malik sees harry, ten feet below. his eyes narrow with an all consuming rage. he glances at the pistol on the beam. back at the girl, the key in her teeth so close. harry maneuvers the cockpit directly under dana.}

<L>__{exterior harrier day}

<L>__{exterior building day}
<A>__{the helicopter appears around the corner, guns blazing in the doors. harry pivots the plane and fires the nose cannon. the helicopter is riddled. it tilts and plummets, auto rotating out of control.}

<L>__{exterior harrier day}
<A>__{the harrier dips and slews, half out of control. malik is taking aim with the pistol, right at harry's head. harry grabs his daughter with his left hand, holding her with all his strength and he jinks the stick hard, just as malik opens fire, but the plane tilts wildly and malik topples, screaming he slides along the wing, and falls over the leading edge only to catch himself on the only available hand hold the last sidewinder missile.}
