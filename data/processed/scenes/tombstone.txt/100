<L>__{ext cowboy camp # 2 night}
<A>__{the cowboy posse is camped in a draw up in the whetstones. they look up as the stage rolls up and stops. shouting and commotion as behan and breakenridge approach and confer with the driver, then behan turns to ringo:}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{robbery. 2 men stuck 'em up and killed a passenger. one of 'em rode a mexican saddle, the other had a mother hubbard. billy grounds and zwing hunt.}
<A>__{behan opens the door. mr. fabian lies inside cradled in josephine's arms, surrounded by the other actors in the troupe. reclined at full length, head back, he looks like the dying hamlet, even more beautiful than in life. breakenridge gasps:}
<C>__{breakenridge}
<D>__{oh, no...}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{we're headed for a booking in denver. they tried to take my watch. he cursed them for cowards and they shot him. he may've been vain and an actor but he was better than all of you. and gentler and braver. i don't understand any of this, i only know it's ugly. you're all ugly and he was beautiful, he tried to put something fine into your ugly world and you killed him for it. anyway the ones who did it are headed north. not that you care.}
<A>__{ringo shrugs. his soft face suddenly turning resolute. breakenridge goes to his horse and mounts.}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{where're you going? get back here!}
<A>__{the little deputy straightens his spectacles, turning to behan:}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir, but we got to have some law.}
<A>__{and he rides off alone into the whetstones. behan sputters, but:}
<C>__{ringo}
<D>__{let him go. who cares?}
