<L>__{exterior housing estate night}
<D>__{a large public housing estate is being swept by rain. christmas lights glow in the windows of the dilapidated tower blocks. stepan is walking against the wind, carrying a bag of shopping. he holds onto his russian hat to stop it blowing away. kids splash in the puddles. stepan arrives at the front garden of his small, ground floor council flat. as he fumbles for his keys in the cold we see that nikolai is watching him from the driver's seat of his mercedes. once stepan has disappeared into his flat, nikolai gets out of the car and approaches stepan's flat.}
