<A>__{thwack, thwack... thwack. mills punches the heavy bag with hard, quick punches. sweat drips off his face. he's in work out clothing, a bundle of nerves wearing boxing gloves. the walls are covered in mirrors. other cops watch mills as they pass, checking out the new kid. mills keeps punching, skillfully. he stops when he sees somerset reflected in one of the mirrors. somerset walks over, carrying a pizza box with paper piled on top. he sits on a near bench, takes out a cigarette.}
