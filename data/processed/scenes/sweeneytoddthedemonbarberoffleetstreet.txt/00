<L>__{interior dark chamber night}
<A>__{foreboding organ music is heard... we are looking down at a rough brick floor ... is it an alley? ... a cobblestone street? ... a warehouse? a factory? ... we're not sure... the flickering glow of flame is the only illumination... the ominous organ music continues as... from the bottom of the frame... a dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up the frame, defying gravity ... the flickering flame reflected in the blood... finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame. suddenly a shrill factory whistle blows enormously loud blood chilling and spine shattering the whistle is a bizarre combination of sound: a factory whistle; a hog being slaughtered; a dog snarling; a roaring inferno; a human scream and a man's face appears, upside down, reflected in the pool of blood. he is the gentleman, a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and matching waistcoat. a cold and superior aristocrat. the camera slowly revolves the gentleman becoming right side up as }
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{attend the tale of sweeney todd. his skin was pale and his eye was odd. he shaved the faces of gentlemen who never thereafter were heard of again. he trod a path that few have trod, did sweeney todd, the demon barber of fleet street.}
<A>__{we cut from the blood to see the gentleman standing before us. strangely impassive. we are in an eerie dark chamber, unclear, a low ceiling, a world of silhouettes and shadows. another figure emerges from the miasma of shadows, into the hellish flickering of flame: the banker. he is large, rotund and sleek. impressive muttonchops.}
<C>__{banker}
<D>__{he kept a shop in london town, of fancy clients and good renown, and what if none of their souls were saved? they went to their maker impeccably shaved...}
<A>__{more figures begin to emerge from the shadows, joining the gentleman and the banker as...}
<C>__{banker}
<D>__{by sweeney, by sweeney todd, the demon barber of fleet street.}
<A>__{although prosaic in appearance these figures are, in fact,}
<B>__{ghosts.}
<C>__{ghosts}
<D>__{swing your razor wide, sweeney! hold it to the skies! freely flows the blood of those who moralize!}
<A>__{as they continue, the new figures become more distinct... the general, a tough, leather skinned military man in a crimson imperial uniform...}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{his needs were few, his room was bare:}
<A>__{the priest, a lean, severe man with pale skin in clerical attire...}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{a lavabo and a fancy chair...}
<A>__{the tourist, a small, meek man with glasses in an ill fitting suit...}
<C>__{tourist}
<D>__{a mug of suds and a leather strop, an apron, a towel, a pail and a mop...}
<A>__{the student, a dashing young man from oxford with luxurious long hair...}
<C>__{student}
<D>__{for neatness he deserves a nod, does sweeney todd...}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{the demon barber of fleet street.}
<A>__{the ghosts are a bit more insinuating now as they move around this mysterious world...}
<C>__{ghosts}
<P>__{(variously)}
<D>__{inconspicuous sweeney was, quick and quiet and clean `e was. back of his smile, under his word, sweeney heard music that nobody heard. sweeney pondered and sweeney planned, like a perfect machine 'e planned, sweeney was smooth, sweeney was subtle, sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle...}
<A>__{the specters are becoming more insistent, their strange impassivity giving way to accusation as the flickering red flame becomes an inferno }
<C>__{ghosts}
<P>__{(variously)}
<D>__{sweeney was smooth, sweeney was subtle, sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle. inconspicuous sweeney was, quick and quiet and clean 'e was, like a perfect machine 'e was, was sweeney! sweeney! sweeney! sweeeeeneeeeey!}
<A>__{on this explosive note we revolve away from the ghostly furies to discover sweeney todd. standing before us. an unclear figure, silhouetted in blazing red flames. we slowly push in on him as:}
<C>__{ghosts}
<D>__{attend the tale of sweeney todd. he served a dark and a vengeful god. what happened then }
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{well, who's to say?}
<C>__{banker}
<D>__{and he wouldn't want us to give it away,}
<C>__{ghosts}
<P>__{(variously)}
<D>__{not sweeney, not sweeney todd, the demon barber of fleet street.}
<A>__{on this note, we push in tight on the figure of todd... music and the clanging of a clock tower bell are heard as we slowly begin pulling back and are imperceptibly transported to...}
