<L>__{int plymouth night (1946)}
<A>__{andy dufresne, mid 20's, wire rim glasses, three piece suit. under normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly dangerous, perhaps even meek. but these circumstances are far from normal. he is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. a cigarette smolders in his mouth. his eyes, flinty and hard, are riveted to the bungalow up the path. he can hear them fucking from here. he raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. the radio plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him:}
<D>__{you stepped out of a dream... you are too wonderful... to be what you seem...}
<A>__{he opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped in a rag. he lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully revealing a .38 revolver. oily, black, evil. he grabs a box of bullets. spills them everywhere, all over the seats and floor. clumsy. he picks bullets off his lap, loading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim. six in the chamber. his gaze goes back to the bungalow. he shuts off the radio. abrupt silence, except for the distant lovers' moans. he takes another shot of bourbon courage, then opens the door and steps from the car.}
<L>__{ext plymouth night (1946)}
<A>__{his wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. loose bullets scatter to the ground. the bourbon bottle drops and shatters. he starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. the closer he gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. louder and more frenzied. the lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{oh god...oh god...oh god...}
<A>__{andy lurches to a stop, listening. the woman cries out in orgasm. the sound slams into andy's brain like an icepick. he shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop. it finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left is the shallow gasping and panting of post coitus. we hear languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{oh god...that's sooo good...you're the best...the best i ever had...}
<A>__{andy just stands and listens, devastated. he doesn't look like much of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun held loosely at his side. a pathetic figure, really.}

<C>__{d.a.}
<D>__{a revolver holds six bullets, not eight. i submit to you this was not a hot blooded crime of passion! that could at least be understood, if not condoned. no, this was revenge of a much more brutal and cold blooded nature. consider! four bullets per victim! not six shots fired, but eight! that means he fired the gun empty...and then stopped to reload so he could shoot each of them again! an extra bullet per lover...right in the head.}
