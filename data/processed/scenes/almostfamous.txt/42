<L>__{interior hallway russell's hotel room night}
<A>__{william, polexia and an ambivalent penny walk the hallway, looking for the room. william looks in the passing open doors, each one a different window into another world.}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{okay. time to put on the lampshade.}
<A>__{up ahead, the door to their smallish hotel room is open. inside, a band party in full swing. a clunky early model boom box segues from james brown's "make it funky" to led zeppelin's "gallows pole." russell hammond is the center of this party, jabbing out the chords, playing along on guitar. much singing echoes all around. it's a hotel room hootenanny, and all members of the band are present. penny lane takes a breath and enters, with arms extended and pointing in opposite directions. she does a flawless stewardess imitation, with proper hand gestures, to a loud party ovation.}
<C>__{penny lane }
<D>__{"ladies and gentlemen. please extinguish all smoking materials and notice that the captain has turned on the no smoking sign. your seat and tray tables should be locked in their full and upright positions." russell others penny!! penny lane!!}

<P>__{(give up)}
<D>__{oh, the hell with it.}
<A>__{they all applaud her, laughing. william watches her with wonder, as she turns his way and winks. jeff approaches the alluring polexia, and goes to get her a beer. meanwhile, polexia sidles up to william. she sees him watching penny at the other side of the room.}
<C>__{polexia}
<P>__{(privately)}
<D>__{act one, in which she pretends she doesn't care about him.}
<A>__{pov shot travels to russell, strumming the guitar that is always a part of his body. russell is watching penny lane surreptitiously.}
<C>__{polexia }
<D>__{act two, in which he pretends he doesn't care... and goes right for her.}
<A>__{russell moves towards penny.}
<C>__{polexia }
<D>__{act three, in which it all plays out the way she planned it. she'll eat him alive.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{we've got to stop them.}
<C>__{polexia}
<D>__{stop them? you were her excuse for coming here.}
<B>__{on penny}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{i need ice!}
<A>__{penny disappears out the door, across the hallway. russell follows a moment later. the kid's eyebrows rise. polexia regards the kid with affection, adjusting his collar and peeling a hair off his jacket.}
<C>__{polexia}
<D>__{i just worry about people using her. you know? 'cause she brings out the good side in everybody else, but what do they do for her?}
<A>__{life kills me.}

<C>__{polexia}
<D>__{do you smoke?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(attempting to fit in)}
<D>__{but i... i grow it. i grow it.}
<A>__{polexia looks at the kid, laughing at his poor job of lying.}
<C>__{polexia}
<D>__{you're funny. you know, if you were only taller, english, rich, a guitar player and older...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i'd be someone else.}
<C>__{polexia}
<D>__{yeah. good pointerior}
<A>__{jeff appears with her beer, and she whispers in the kid's ear before she exits with jeff bebe.}
<C>__{polexia }
<D>__{bless me father for i may sin tonight.}
<A>__{the kid watches, as the boom box plays an obscure favorite of russell's, eddie giles' "losin' boy." there is the sound of a motorcycle somewhere down the hallway.}
