<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(mimicking a little child)}
<D>__{[he had a hidden gun.]}

<C>__{eric}
<D>__{[yes.]}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{[we do?]}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{[yes. it didn't go off. if it had the police would be here and our whole plan would be fucked. but they're not here, and our plan isn't fucked. so if there aren't any more fucking stupid questions i will go downstairs and see if we're in yet. is that okay with you?]}
<A>__{claude nods. then, the phone rings. everyone looks at it.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{[i thought the phones were dead.]}
<A>__{it rings again.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{the phones are dead.}

<C>__{eric}
<D>__{[answer it or you will die.]}

<C>__{woman teller}
<D>__{[it's for you.]}
<A>__{eric takes the phone and pushes her to the floor. he puts the receiver to his ear.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{[hello.]}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{[who is this?]}
<A>__{eric motions to oliver to check the windows. oliver runs over and peeks out the blinds.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{oh my god! the police!}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{[what do you want?]}
<A>__{eric looks around at the dead bodies.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{[we're all fine in here.]}
<A>__{oliver is pacing back and forth wildly. he starts loading extra ammo into his weapon.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{[no. i will tell you what, you go fuck yourself you fucking pig. you send anyone near this building and i will kill the first person i lay my hands on. i've got plenty hostages here to kill so don't even think of coming in.]}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{[just stay put. we'll call you when we're ready. in the mean time, have a nice day.]}
<A>__{eric hangs up the phone, and then leaves it off the hook.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{[the silent alarm must have gone off after all!]}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{[shut the fuck up! the alarm didn't do shit. for all we know your idiot shooting brought them here. anyhow it doesn't matter. nothing has changed.]}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{[my god! the police! what are we going to do?]}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{[nothing. we don't have to do anything. the plan stays the same, just slightly different.]}
<A>__{then eric catches sight of zoey, their eyes lock. eric smiles and winks. then he turns to jean with a whisper.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{[if the police decide to come in...kill them. and if you don't mind, stack those bodies somewhere else. this place is a fucking mess and it's bad for morale.]}
<A>__{then he takes off downstairs, smiling. jean is a little stumped.}
