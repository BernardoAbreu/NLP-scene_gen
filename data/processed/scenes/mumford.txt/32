<A>__{althea leads mumford toward the back of the lavishly appointed house. the weird thing, what gets in the way of the decor, is the cardboard boxes of all sizes which are stacked everywhere. many are unopened, but the rest are spilling their styrofoam nugget and bubble wrap guts to reveal some hint of their contents: a huge variety of catalogue ordered housewares, clothing, linens, gadgets, and knickknacks. if it can be ordered from an upscale catalogue (and everything can), it is here. althea sounds very nervous, cheery.}
