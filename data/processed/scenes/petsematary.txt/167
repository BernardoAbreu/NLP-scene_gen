<L>__{exterior the pet sematary and the back of the arch late evening}
<A>__{the sound of crickets...ree ree ree... the sound of footfalls. faintly, the sound of huey lewis and the news, singing "working for a living." it's now almost twilight. jud and louis enter the pet sematary. louis is looking around curiously.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{well, folks, here we are, in louis creed dreamland.}
<A>__{jud snaps off the walkman and puts the earphones around his neck again.}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{what say, louis?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{nothing. (pause) do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{we're still not where we're going.}
<A>__{he walks past louis and toward the deadfall. louis follows.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{the place we're going is on the other side of that.}
<A>__{he points at the deadfall.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we can't climb over that. we'll break our necks!}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{no. we won't. i have climbed it a time or two before, and i know all the places to step. just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. if you stop, you'll crash through for sure.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i'm not climbing that.}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{give me the cat. i will take care of it myself.}
<A>__{he holds out his hand and louis sees the old man means exactly as he says. after a moment he says:}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{jud starts up one side of the deadfall, and in spite of its snarled tangles, he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of stairs. after a few second, louis follows.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{thank god my blue cross is paid up.}
