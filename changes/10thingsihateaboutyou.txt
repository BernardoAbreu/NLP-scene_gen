<A>__{the other students roll their eyes.}
<C>__{kat}
<P>__{(continuing)}

<A>__{joey dorsey, a well muscled jock with great cheekbones, makes fun of her from his row.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{as opposed to a bitter self righteous hag who has no friends?}

<C>__{mrs. blaise}
<D>__{that's enough, mr. dorsey.}
<A>__{really gets fired up now}

<C>__{miss perky}
<D>__{katarina stratford. my, my. you've been terrorizing ms. blaise again.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.}
<C>__{miss perky}
<D>__{well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild. by the way, bobby rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. i was merely a spectator.}
<C>__{miss perky}
<D>__{the point is kat people perceive you as somewhat ...}
<A>__{kat smiles at her, daring her to say it.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{tempestuous?}
<C>__{miss perky}
<D>__{no ... i believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.}

<E>__{(0.s.)}
<D>__{i realize the language of mr. shakespeare makes him a bit daunting, but i'm sure you're all doing your best.}
<A>__{bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip of her hair to chastity. chastity opens the note and reads: insert "joey dorsey said hi to me in the hall! oh! my god!" chastity frowns to herself.}
<C>__{teacher }
<E>__{(0.s.)}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ms. stratford, do you care to comment on what you've read so far?}
<A>__{bianca looks up and smiles the smile of daddy's little girl.}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{not really.}
<A>__{the teacher shakes her head, but lets it go. mandella. a waif like senior girl who sits off to the side trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her notebook, looks up and raises her hand.}
<C>__{teacher}
<D>__{mandella since you're assisting us, you might as well comment. i'm assuming you read the assignment.}
<C>__{mandella}
<D>__{uh, yeah, i read it all}
<C>__{teacher}
<D>__{the whole play }
<C>__{mandelia}
<D>__{the whole folio. all the plays.}

<A>__{mandella and kat sit down in the quiet corner. they are eating a carton of yogurt with gusto.}
<C>__{mandella}
<A>__{your sister is so amazingly without. she'll never read him. she has no idea. kat attacks}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{the fact that you're cutting gym so you can t.a. sophomore english just to hear his name, is a little without in itself if you ask me.}
<A>__{kat's attention is caught by patrick as he walks by with his friends, lighting up a cigarette. mandella notices her staring.}
<C>__{mandella}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{patrick verona random skid.}
<C>__{mandella}
<D>__{that's pat verona? the one who was gone for a year? i heard he was doing porn movies.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{i'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.}
<C>__{mandella}
<D>__{he always look so}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{block e?}

<C>__{kat}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{mandella}
<D>__{an attempted slit.}
<A>__{kat stares at her, expressionless.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions. you're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.}
<C>__{mandella}
<D>__{but imagine the things he'd say during sex.}
<A>__{thinks a minute}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{okay, say you do it. you kill yourself, you end up in wherever you end up and he's there. do you really think he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound compulsive who failed volleyball?}
<A>__{mandella's attention is struck by bianca}
<B>__{across the courtyard}
<A>__{as she and chastity parade by joey and his cohorts one of the cohorts elbows joey.}
<C>__{cohort}
<D>__{virgin alert.}
<A>__{joey looks up and smiles at bianca.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{lookin' good, ladies.}
<A>__{bianca smiles her coyest of smiles. back to kat and mandella still watching.}
<C>__{mandella}
<D>__{tragic.}
<A>__{doesn't respond}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{michael and cameron observe joey's leers at bianca from their bench in another corner. cowboys eating cue of a can of beans linger on the grass behind them.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{why do girls like that always like guys like that?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{because they're bred to. their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. their gene pool is rarely diluted.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{he always have that shit eating grin?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{joey dorsey? perma shit grin. i wish i could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class. and a model. mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.}

<C>__{kat}
<D>__{yeah, and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow. tough break.}
<C>__{joey}
<P>__{(practically spitting)}
<D>__{they're running the rest of me next month.}
<A>__{he zooms away as kat yanks open the door of her dart. mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they're in a convertible.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{the people at this school are so incredibly foul.}
<C>__{mandella}
<D>__{you could always go with me. i'm sure william has some friends.}

<A>__{mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch.}
<C>__{mandella}
<D>__{that's a charming new development}
<A>__{kat doesn't answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the tape deck. the sounds of joyful punk rock fill the car. as they pull out, michael crosses in front of them on his moped. kat has to slam the brakes to keep from hitting him}
<C>__{kat}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{remove head from sphincter! then pedal!}
<A>__{michael begins fearfully, pedaling as kat peels out, angry at the delay. cameron rushes over}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{you all right?}
<A>__{he slows to a stop}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{that's her? bianca's sister?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the mewling, rampalian wretch herself.}

<C>__{joey}
<D>__{does this conversation have a purpose?}
