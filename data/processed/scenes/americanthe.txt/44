<L>__{interior pensione abruzzo, jack's room morning}
<A>__{jack is looking through his binoculars. jack's pov: ...of a small yellow and blue italian post office van heading up the winding alpine road towards castelveccio.}
<L>__{exterior castelvecchio day}
<A>__{with the market gone, the town is once more dead. and provides no cover. jack parks his car not far from the town square, turns off the engine and gets out.}
<L>__{exterior castelvecchio, town square, cafe day}
<A>__{jack is sitting in the cafe where he met mathilde. he is watching the entrance to the local post office. he studies his watch. it's been an hour and no one has come or gone from the tiny rural branch of the poste italiane. jack puts the correct amount of change on the table and gets up...}
<L>__{interior castelvecchio, post office day}
<A>__{the shop is small and dusty. so is the postmaster.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{buon giorno.}
<A>__{the postmaster grunts his reply, jutting his chin.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{il fermo posta?}
<A>__{the postmaster turns to a rack of pigeonholes behind a sack of mail hanging in a metal frame like an old person's walking aid. from one pigeonhole he draws a bundle of general delivery envelopes held together by an elastic band. some have been there for weeks. months even.}
<C>__{postmaster}
<D>__{nome?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{clarke.}
<A>__{deftly, like a teller counting through a thick wad of banknotes he flicks through the mail with thin, wasted fingers.}
<C>__{postmaster}
<D>__{clarky?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{clarke. una pacchetto.}
<C>__{postmaster}
<D>__{pacchetto!}
<A>__{this makes all the difference. the postmaster clicks again, disappearing behind the rack of pigeon holes...}
<C>__{postmaster}
<D>__{clarky, clarky, clarky. ecco.}
<A>__{...and reappearing with a package. the package is from an italian photographic suppliers.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{grazie.}
<C>__{postmaster}
<D>__{identificazione.}
<A>__{jack flicks his eyes downwards. he has already put his passport on the counter. the postmaster scoops it up with bony fingers. looks from the picture to jack. jack bears the scrutiny with a deadly straight face.}
