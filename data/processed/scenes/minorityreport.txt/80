<L>__{exterior an apartment building later}
<A>__{an oppressive brick thing on a side street. the facade is crumbling. nothing good happens in a building like this.. the guy leads anderson to the building, then scurries off into the night.}
<L>__{interior room later}
<A>__{a stained overstuffed chair in the corner, a dreary little kitchen with crusted dishes in the sink. but jarringly, in the center of all this, is a make shift hypertech medical setup: a gleaming operating table, an array of lasers, scalpels and surgical equipment, an anesthesia console. anderson sits in a chair facing doc. doc is a big man with delicate fingers. he sneezes, then blows his nose hard into a handkerchief.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{got a cold.}
<A>__{anderson looks at him uneasily. it's not just doc it's the whole setup, the needles and scalpels, the medical thing, which anderson truly does not care for. doc sneezes again, then looks up at his patient.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{don't worry. i could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there, and you'd never get an infection. not with the spectrum antibios i will be shooting into you.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{i'm not here for cat surgery, doc.}
<A>__{doc chuckles. then he waits, expectantly. anderson hands him a tiny opalescent card. a preset cash card. doc slides it into small console, watches the numbers flash up. he frowns, sighs.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{it's all i could safely move}
<A>__{he waits. doc's not thrilled, but finally, he nods.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{yeah. all right.}
<A>__{time to got down to business. doc walks over to a large medical cabinet and opens the door. it's full of eyes, and parts of eyes 611 ! a cryo jars. anderson tightens.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{you understand what i told you then. i can't just give you new irises. the scanners will read the scar tissue. alarms will go off.}
<C>__{andersoin}
<D>__{i'm a cop, i know}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i gotta take your eyes out.}
<A>__{anderson knows this, too, wishes doc would shut up anderson yeah.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{and put in new ones.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{yeah. i get it, doc.}
<A>__{anderson rises up out of his chair and goes over to the operating table. he lies down.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{do me quick before i run out of here.}
<A>__{anderson lies there, blinking up at the ceiling. he listens to doc preparing instrument trays. it's a bad sound.}
