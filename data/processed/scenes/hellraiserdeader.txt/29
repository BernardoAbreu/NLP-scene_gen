<L>__{interior subway car night}
<A>__{the interior of the car has been transformed into some odd ball cross between a very small nightclub and an crackhouse.. as the train passes out of the station, and the lights dim, we can see the lights from joints and crack pipes or at any rate something being smoked in some kind of pipe, glinting in the darkness. various hands reach up and tug down the newspapers, and the tunnel lights come in, providing a flickering, constantly changing illumination. in the uncertain light, amy can see the various celebrants hanging out some on the seats, some on the floor, some dressed, some partially undressed, some engaging in desultory drug use, others in desultory sex acts mostly teenagers and twenty nothings. amy looks around, not particularly effected by the oddness of the scene. the conductor touches her arm.}
<C>__{conductor}
<D>__{down that way...}
<A>__{she threads her way through the tangle of people. in the flickering lights she catches glimpses of pale human flesh, pierced faces, pierced nipples pierced things that we can't even be sure what they are. expressions flash by in the flickering light, some dull, others laughing. she pretty much ignores it all as she makes her way toward the rear of the car. a rat feeds on the contents of a young woman's purse as she and another woman are tangled in passion. there, illuminated in flashes, joey, a thin ill shaven english guy in his mid twenties is sprawled on a seat. one of his lower eyelids has a ring in it. it flicks up every time he blinks. he reads a newspaper while a woman bobs her head up and down in his lap. joey looks up and spots amy. he points an accusing finger at her, but his mood is good natured..}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{ahhhh, now here comes a daring soul. a person committed to a just cause. another seeker of the truth no doubt.}
<A>__{joey is clearly smitten with amy.}
<C>__{joey }
<D>__{i like what i see inside of you.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{are you joey?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i've been called worse.}
<A>__{he brushes the hair of the woman in his lap, then offers amy his hand.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{and i have the privilege of meeting...}
<A>__{amy looks at the woman in his lap, declines a hand shake.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{amy klein. marla chen sent me. i'm looking for a girl named katya. another young girl with red hair and half her head shaved. a guy with glasses named winter.}
<A>__{joey's eyes narrow. something has clearly clicked. he laughs slightly, starts shaking his head.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{and the plot thickens. don't tell me you're mixed up with those mother fuckers. tell me amy klein, do you even know what they're about?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{that's why i'm here. i need you to help me find them.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{oh, jeez. moral quandary time here... what should he do, what should he do? if he tells her the hopefully available and eminently fuckable damsel is thrown into the pit of oblivion or anyway is potentially fucked up for life. and that would be such a regrettable waste. if he refrains from telling her... she may yet be saved. a possible trophy awaits me. angel and devil on the shoulder... hmm. angel, devil, angel, devil. oh, the hell with it entropy's destroying everything anyway. why shouldn't i do my part?}
<C>__{a}
<C>__{my}
<D>__{tell me what you know about the deaders.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{you first. what do you think they do?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i think they bring the dead back to life.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{is that what you really think?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{who are they? where can i find winter?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{some people say winter's some sort of fucked up guru, some say he's not human, and others say he's not real. but there is a place they hang out those who believe i mean.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{where is it?}
<A>__{joey hesitates. a part of him clearly doesn't want to tell.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{joey...}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{angel, devil, angel, devil.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{if you don't tell me, someone here will.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{yeah, you see, now that's the problem. you've got that fucked up self destructive thing going on.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i'm already into it.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{angel, devil, angel, devil}
<A>__{amy produces the puzzle box from her pack. joey looks at it like he's just seen a ghost.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{this is making me very unhappy...}
<A>__{he pushes the woman from his lap. he's more serious now.}
<C>__{joey }
<D>__{poteilari and minvara. on the northeast corner, two doors down, there's a stairway going down into a closed up building. it's always locked, and they're not always there. i don't know where they are when they're not. and once you get mixed up with them it's like that story with the tar baby chances are you never get loose, and if you do, you never get clean.}
<A>__{the "conductor" shouts from somewhere.}
<C>__{conductor}
<D>__{coming in!}
<A>__{hands promptly reach up, covering the windows with newspaper. the conductor goes to the door. the band finishes its set as the light from the station shines through the newspapers. joey, looking drab in the steady uneven light, stares at amy.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i can't take responsibility for you.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i'm not asking you to.}
<A>__{amy begins to walk off. joey leans forward, for the first time he seems sincere, almost foreboding. he shouts over the breaking train.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{amy klein, i'm doing a change of heart thing here, which doesn't usually happen with strangers, but i'm trying to give a little back, it's this whole karma kick i'm on don't do it. don't go any deeper. forget about it. move away. change your name. become somebody different.}
<A>__{the other members of the car watch the two of them.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{can't do that. i've got that fucked up self destructive thing going on.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{yes you do.}
<A>__{the one door hisses open. amy stares at joey for a second, turns and departs, back into the fluorescent lit station. joey calls after her.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{only he can bring you back!}
