<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{long shot of the aircraft carrier}
<A>__{floating over the game grid, with a view of the light cycle arena. zoom in on the section of the grid where the game is about to start.}
<B>__{a shot from above}
<A>__{the three blue warriors are lined up facing our friends, on opposite sides of the large arena, about a half mile square, surrounded by high bulwarks, and surveyed by recognizers. we can see the carrier hovering high overhead.}
<B>__{close on tron}
<C>__{tron}
<D>__{that's what my user wants, too...}
<B>__{shot of the three friends}
<A>__{holding the handlebars of the cycles in front of them. we see tron and ram looking at flynn, in the center.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{i know...}
<A>__{close shot flynn with a sizzling electrical discharge, the light cycle is inscribed around him.}
<B>__{shot of the three blue cycles}
<A>__{ready to go.}
<B>__{shot of the three conscript cycles}
<A>__{also ready.}
<B>__{sark}
<A>__{his finger presses a button and the buzzer sounds again.}
<B>__{shot from above of all cycles taking off}
<A>__{we see the six solid walls being formed behind the cycles. as we watch the outer four cycles veer off to either side, leaving tron and his opponent speeding suicidally at each other: tron's pov of the other cycle heading straight at him.}
<B>__{shot from above}
<A>__{we see these two cycles come together and almost crash ... but both turn at the last second to the same side and continue rushing forward. the other cycles can be seen racing around the edge of the arena.}
<C>__{flynn's voice}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{nice one!}
<B>__{shot of tron and his opponent}
<A>__{they start making turns, passing walls they have already created, each trying to box the other in.}
<C>__{tron's voice}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{ram, stay all the way over ...}
<A>__{close shot from the side tron rushing forward.}
<B>__{shot of the cycles}
<A>__{turning.}
<C>__{ram's voice}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{i've got control. go ahead.}
<A>__{shot from in front of tron's cycle}
<B>__{shot from above}
<A>__{they rush past a wall, headed directly for a bulwark at the end of the arena. tron is on one side, but the blue warrior is on the inside. tron forces the warrior to smash straight into the wall. there is an explosion as the cycle de rezzes, and a crack forms in the bulwark. we see that the walls created by the de rezzed warrior dissolve as he does.}
<B>__{shot of flynn}
<A>__{rushing alongside his opponent. they make a turn.}
<B>__{close up of flynn long shot}
<A>__{they make another turn}
<B>__{shot of two cycles rushing}
<A>__{right at the camera. flynn's pov of the maze of walls. he gets clear for a moment and spots the crack in the bulwark. close up his face reacting, getting an idea.}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{you guys...follow me.}
<B>__{shot of the two cycles}
<A>__{racing together, approaching the bulwark. at the last second, the blue warrior turns, but flynn races right at the crack.}
<B>__{sark}
<A>__{observing this. with satisfaction. now he will be rid of the user.}
<B>__{flynn}
<A>__{he races straight at the crack... and through it.}
<B>__{sark}
<A>__{his face suffused with anger. he slams a fist down on the console in front of him.}
<B>__{long shot of the grid}
<A>__{the remaining four cycles are still racing around the arena. close up tron reacting to flynn's escape, hope in his eyes.}
<B>__{angle on ram}
<A>__{smashing another one of the blue warriors against a wall. he turns and races up next to tron.}
<B>__{shot of them}
<A>__{side by side. they look at each other.}
<C>__{ram}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{tron}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{do it!}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{we see their cycles veer off and head straight for the crack. we hear a loud siren and a mechanical voice starts up:}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(through loudspeaker)}
<D>__{warriors must stay within the game grid. repeat: all warriors must stay within the game grid. warning. warning.}
<A>__{we continue to hear this voice repeating under the escape, gradually diminishing as the three friends get farther away, until it dies out altogether.}
<B>__{shot of two recognizers}
<A>__{moving towards the dividing bulwark, passing over it.}
<B>__{shot of the three escaping cycles}
<A>__{racing through the narrow crack in the bulwark, barely enough room to get by. they emerge into an open corridor, with the recognizers appearing overhead. we watch the cycles rush past the camera...}
<B>__{sark}
<A>__{he is pacing across the bridge of the carrier, smashing guards out of his way.}
<C>__{sark}
<D>__{get them. send out every game tank in the grid! get them!}
<B>__{shot from below flynn}
<A>__{as he looks up and spots the recognizers hovering over them, about to come down for the kill.}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{watch it!}
<C>__{ram}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{recognizers!}
<B>__{shot of ram}
<A>__{heading for a smaller opening in one wall, labeled "game storage."}
<B>__{shot from behind}
<A>__{as the three cycles race into the opening. the reco's are blocked, way too big to fit through the opening.}
