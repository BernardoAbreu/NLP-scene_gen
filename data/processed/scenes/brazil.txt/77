<L>__{interior sam's flat night}
<A>__{sam wakes up. his feet are entangled in some wiring and ducting. he is still in his devastated sitting room. as he untangles himself the door bell rings. it takes a moment for sam to recognise it as the door bell. annoyed and still disturbed by the dream he gets up and goes to the door. he opens it. in bursts a girl dressed in a silly bell boy costume with lots of glitter, net stockings and big bowed tap dancing shoes. she launches into a terrible song and dance routine.}
