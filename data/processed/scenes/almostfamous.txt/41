<L>__{interior hyatt house lobby night}
<A>__{penny blasts into the continental hyatt house, william on her arm. the lobby of this bastion of seventies rock is more alive than most clubs. it's a swirling mass of roadies carrying halliburton briefcases plastered with tour stickers, mingling rockers, and more than a few groupies with lower ambitions and taller platforms than penny lane. the feeling is communal, illicit, intoxicating. the secret community of rock. penny attracts a hailstorm of friends and comrades.}

<D>__{opie!!!}
<A>__{she hugs him like a long lost friend, knocking the air out of him. and now overlapping this action, appears superfan ric nunez, 14. his eyes are forever moist, but he's oddly formal and never feels worthy of the rockers he idolizes. tonight he wears a custom homemade t shirt with iron on block letters. it features the four led zeppelin symbols and the words: "to be a rock and not to roll." a felt tip pen is still in his quivering hand. nunez walks with them, backpedaling as he says:}
<C>__{ric}
<D>__{it's all happening. i just saw them on the seventh floor! mr. jimmy page... mr. john paul jones...}
<P>__{(displays squiggle on shirt)}

<D>__{ric is a zeppelin fan.}

<C>__{ric}
<D>__{they're on the 12th floor, but there's guards there! so you gotta go to the tenth floor and go up the back steps.}
<C>__{penny lane}
