<L>__{interior mother miriam's study day}
<D>__{mother miriam is standing checking some papers when martha}
<A>__{enters. mother miriam seems to have entirely regained her good humour.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{well... what do you think? is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{what's your opinion?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{i believe agnes is different.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{from other nuns...}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{yes i... i've noticed.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{from other people!}
<P>__{(moving across the room)}
<D>__{i believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{how could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{because she's an innocent. she's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by god.}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(lights a cigarette)}
<D>__{that's ridiculous...}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<P>__{(moves to her desk, starts writing)}
<D>__{in her case it isn't. she's had very little schooling. her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died agnes came here, to us. she's never been out there doctor. she's never seen a movie or a television show. she's never even read a book.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{if she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{she didn't! this is manslaughter, not murder. she didn't consciously kill that baby. she'd lost a lot of blood. she was unconscious by the time we got to her.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{so, someone else could have done it.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{no... not in the eyes of the police.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{and in your eyes?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{i've already told you what i thought.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{that she was unconscious, yes! so someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{you don't really believe something like that happened do you?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{it's possible isn't it?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{one of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal. mother miriam removes the tray from under a pot plant and}
<A>__{bangs it down in front of martha to act as an ashtray.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{that's absurd!}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{that possibility never occurred to you?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{no one knew about agnes' pregnancy. no one. not even agnes.}
