<A>__{and the others look down a sheer cliff on the bug battery, a charred circular pit some ten meters across. inside, something is moving.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{what kind of stinkin' bug is that ?}
<A>__{johnny jumps the magnification on his "head up". down in the pit, a giant translucent plasma bug rears out of one of the subterranean tunnels that ring the battery.}
<C>__{sugar watkins}
<D>__{you never seen how they do it before ?}
<A>__{johnny shakes his head. swollen breeder bugs gather around the plasma bug to inject it with their catalytic jelly.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{agghh ! it's making me sick...!}
<A>__{the plasma bug writhes in pain and begins to swell, color changing from yellow to blue in accordance with some violent internal chemical reaction.}
<C>__{sugar watkins}
<D>__{it's gonna pop !}
<A>__{womp ! the plasma bug explodes in its cauldron. a blast of bug plasma streaks past them towards the heavens. now a new plasma bug crawls into the pit to begin the cycle anew.}
<C>__{gillespie}
<D>__{sir, look !}
<A>__{sergeant gillespie points. a hole opens near the battery and dozens of warriors rampage out of the ground and up the cliff face toward the roughneck position.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{we must be right over the colony. let's get some air support, eh ?}
<C>__{gillespie}
<D>__{yes, sir ! fleet, this is roughneck patrol, over ...?}
<A>__{rasczak moves off down the line giving orders.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{corporal, i want pulse cannons there and there ! rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! sugar, bring up that flame thrower !}
<C>__{gillespie}
<D>__{fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... they'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{they'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. who's got the nuke ?}
<C>__{dizzy}
<D>__{that'd be me, sir.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{heat it up.}
<A>__{dizzy activates a tactical nuke. it makes a distinctive highpitched squeal.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{roughnecks, you may fire at will.}
<A>__{the roughnecks open fire. bugs are blown to pieces but they keep climbing. a warrior breeches their line. sugar watkins torches it. the nuke's ready light flashes.}
<C>__{dizzy}
<D>__{i'm hot, sir !}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{fire ! blast shields down !}
<A>__{johnny blows a warrior away from the edge. dizzy leans over and fires. the rocket streaks down toward the battery.}
<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{hit the dirt !}
<A>__{an explosion in the two kiloton range turns the world black and white. when color returns johnny and the others look down on the smoldering crater which was once the bug battery.}
<C>__{gillespie}
<D>__{now comes the part i hate the most.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{what's that ?}
<C>__{gillespie}
<D>__{we go down into the colony and make sure all the queens are dead.}
