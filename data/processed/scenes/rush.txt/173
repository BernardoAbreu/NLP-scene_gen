<L>__{exterior starting grid day}
<A>__{niki's engine replies with a loud roar. he looks over at james. james turns to face niki..}
<B>__{all sound goes silent...}
<A>__{...as james and niki stare at one another. all around them, the world slows down. comes to a standstill.}
<B>__{their eyes meet...}
<A>__{a connection between them. unspoken realization of where they have both got to. what this moment means. for them both.. it's what they have been waiting for. working towards. all this time. niki raises his hand. in a gesture only james sees. james raises his in return. a private salute. chivalric. from a bygone era. and in that moment, enemies become brothers. two men. risking their lives.}
<B>__{the ten second flag is raised..}
<A>__{the moment's truce is broken. they return to the task at hand. the flag drops. they're off.}
