<A>__{most of the workers have gone home, because most of the work is done. all the floor are hand scrapped cherry; huge beams and wood planks lend a strength to the ceiling. the kitchen cabinets are in; the bathrooms are complete. sam, ryan, alyssa, adam and peter are the only ones left. outside, we hear a car pull to a stop.}
