<A>__{a strip of two lane highway runs through a tall pine forest. there is a truck stop coffee shop beside the roadway. a few 14 wheelers are scattered across the big dusty parking lot. morning sunlight glints off their chrome stacks. it bakes the asphalt and warms the mangy hides of stray dogs asleep in the dirt. a helicopter hovers about the treetops like a lazy hummingbird. it's the beginning of a perfect day. a highway patrol car slowly trolls among the trucks and dogs and parks beside the slat and shingled building. two telephone linemen are scaling a power pole at the forest's edge.}
