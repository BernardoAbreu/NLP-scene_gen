<T>__{over black we see:}
<B>__{chyron}
<A>__{a long time ago, in front of a convenience store far, far away }
<L>__{exterior quick stop years ago day}
<A>__{we fade in : on the block of stores (quick stop rst), from sometime ago, in fact, rst isn't rst; it's the record rack a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. a white trash mother (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap comes into frame carrying a chubby baby. the baby wears an oversized t shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe, and messily eats a chocolate bar. there are food stamps in the mother's hands.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{bobby boy stay here while mommy picks up the free cheese, 'kay?}
<A>__{she looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly, then looks back at the baby on the ground. she takes off her baseball cap and places it on the baby.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{this'll keep the sun out of your eyes. you be good now.}
<A>__{she walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall. with the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks kind of familiar. then, another mother (also very young) decked out in a kiss concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair enters, with a black skullcap wearing baby slung at her hip. she sees the first baby, sitting against the wall and sets her baby down beside him.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{don't fucking move, you little shit machine. mommy's gonna try to score.}
<A>__{a passerby enters, heading toward the convenience store. he takes note of the babies and the mother heading into the record store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted.}
<C>__{passerby}
<D>__{excuse me who's watching these babies?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{the fat one's watching the little one.}
<C>__{passerby}
<D>__{oh, nice parenting.}
<P>__{(walking away)}
<D>__{leave'em out here like that and see what happens.}
<A>__{the passerby walks away. the mother flips him the bird.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{fuck you, you fucking square!}
<C>__{passerby}
<P>__{(waving her off)}
<D>__{ah, keep on truckin'.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(to baby)}
<D>__{d'jou hear the crazy fuck tellin' me how to fuckin' raise you? motherfucker, man! who's he fucking think he is? what's the worse fuckin' thing could happen to you sitting outside the fuckin' stores? fuck!}
<A>__{the door closes, and the babies sit there quietly for a beat. then, they look at each other. the larger one says nothing. the smaller one says }
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{fuck, fuck, fuck...}
