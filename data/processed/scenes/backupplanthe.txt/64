<L>__{interior cheese cave night}
<A>__{it's floor to ceiling wooden shelves all filled with cheese. stan ceremoniously unwraps a wheel.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{it's cheese.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i can see that.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{it's a new kind of goat's milk we're using. i've been developing the recipe, and now it needs to age. it'll be ready for market in several months.}
<P>__{(then, excited)}
<D>__{want to know what it's called?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{zoe.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{you named a piece of cheese after me?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{not just one piece. the whole line. this will forever in history be known as the zoe.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{unless, of course, it tastes like shit, and then we'll just scrap it.}
<P>__{(with a wink)}
<D>__{but that'll never happen.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{because it's going to be fantastic. sweet and sassy and very complex. why do you think i'm calling it zoe?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{no one's ever named a piece of cheese after me before.}
<A>__{zoe stares at the cheese for a long time.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you're kind of hard to read right now. you're either seriously flattered or totally repulsed.}
<A>__{zoe smiles.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i want to kiss you right now, but it really smells like cheese in here.}
