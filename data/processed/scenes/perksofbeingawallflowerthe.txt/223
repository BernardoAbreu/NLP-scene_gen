<L>__{interior fort pitt tunnel night}
<A>__{... they enter the tunnel, and we realize just how fast they're driving. the white tiles of the tunnel whiz by at blinding speed. a perfect night. a perfect drive. flying.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i know these will all be stories someday. and our pictures will become old photographs. and we'll all become somebody's mom or dad. but right now, these moments are not stories.}
<A>__{charlie turns to face forward. to the moment. to sam, smiling at him from the front seat.}
<D>__{charlie (v.o) (cont'd) this is happening. i am here. and i am looking at her. and she is so beautiful.}
<A>__{sam kisses charlie. then, she turns, and all three kids look ahead to everything in front of them. charlie begins to stand in the back of the truck. ready to leave the tunnel.}
<D>__{charlie (v.o.) (cont'd) i can see it. this one moment when you know you're not a sad story. you are alive. and as you stand up and see the lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder. and you are listening to that song on that drive with the people you love most in this world.}
<A>__{charlie stands in the back of the truck. the wind on his face. he is free.}
<D>__{charlie (v.o.) (cont'd) and in this moment, i swear...}
<A>__{we see the moment as charlie sees it. the tunnel's exit getting bigger and brighter with the lights of the city behind it.}
<D>__{charlie (v.o.) (cont'd) ... we are infinite.}
<A>__{the tunnel song blasts over the speakers as the truck flies out of the tunnel. sam and patrick scream with excitement. charlie holds his arms in the air. the weight of the world gone. if only for a moment. this one moment. we see the city. a million lights like white stars in a glass dome. we crane to the sky. we are in heaven.}
