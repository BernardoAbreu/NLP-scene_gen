<A>__{for a moment nick stands in the light from the door, listening to the wind. he looks down at the pistol again, then he heaves it into the trees. the wind gusts. the snow swirls and hisses, slipping through the woods in great streaming wraiths. nick watches it for a moment, then he turns and goes back in.}
<L>__{exterior nick's trailer dusk}
<A>__{the trailer is lonely looking, dark and cold. vince pulls into the yard beside nick's car and skips to a stop. nick gets out, says a few words to vince and everyone laughs. nick goes around to the trunk, removes his gear, slams the lid and pounds on the car. vince takes off, thudding over the curb with his load of three dead deer. nick crosses to the trailer and goes inside.}
