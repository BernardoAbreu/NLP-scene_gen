<A>__{ pathological society of london}
<B>__{bright light}
<A>__{as we pull back and down in a slow spiral we see the light is coming through high windows. we now see several rows of distinguished doctors talking to each other in anticipation. as we continue to spiral down we see treves before them at a podium. behind him are two assistants standing beside a curtained stall. treves raps a pointer stick on the podium to bring the meeting to order. we move behind the stall as the assistants part the curtains and we see the silhouette of the elephant man. the doctors talk among themselves quietly.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{he is english, he is twenty one years of age and his name is john merrick. gentlemen, in the course of my profession i have come upon lamentable deformities of the face due to injury or disease, as well as mutilations and contortions of the body, depending upon like causes; but, at no time have i met with such a dreaded or perverted version of a human being as this man. i wish to draw your attention to the insidious conditions affecting this patient. note, if you will, the extreme enlargement of the skull... and upper limb, which is totally useless. the alarming curvature of the spine... turn him, please... the looseness of the skin, and the varying fibrous tumors that cover 90% of the body.}
<A>__{treves' voice fades as we dissolve to : the doctors, who at first were rigid and flustered, and now bent forward, concentrating, obviously consumed with interest. spiraling down again we see treves finishing his lecture.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{...and there is every indication that these afflictions have been in existence, and have progressed rapidly, since birth. the patient also suffers from chronic bronchitis. as an interesting side note, in spite of the afore mentioned anomalies, the patient's genitals remain entirely intact and unaffected.}
<A>__{treves nods to the assistants and they go to the elephant man. we see them in shadow untying the loose knot of the loin cloth. close up of the shadow of the head of the elephant man. it goes up for a breath.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{so then, gentlemen, owing to this series of deformities: the congenital exostoses of the skull; extensive papillomatous growths and large pendulous masses in connection with the skin; the great enlargement of the right upper limb, involving all the bones; the massive distortion of the head and the extensive areas covered by papillomatous growth, the patient has been called, "the elephant man."}
<B>__{treves office}
<A>__{the elephant man (hereafter the e.m.) wearing his cloak, is seated by the desk. treves stands behind him, measuring his head with calipers. he removes the calipers and notes the span, then sets them on the desk. he places the hood over the e.m.'s head. treves sits at his desk and makes some final notes. he becomes more absorbed in his notes than in the e.m. the e.m. makes an unintelligible sound.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{hmm?}
<A>__{the e.m. is silent. treves, only now realizing that the e.m. has said something, looks up at him.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{hmm?}
<A>__{the e.m. is silent. treves passes it off as a sigh and turns back to his work.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{it's been a long day for everyone.}
<A>__{he closes his notebook and rises. he remembers something.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{oh, yes, you'll need a cab...}
<P>__{(to the e.m.)}
<D>__{stay.}
<A>__{he exits. the e.m. is alone. he rises and shuffles slowly about, investigating the room. he goes to the desk and begins touching things, including the calipers. he notices the card treves gave to the owner tucked in the back pages. he pauses for a moment and then takes the card. his hand disappears into the cloak, and he moves back into the corner behind the stiff, black operating coat. treves re enters.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{come with me.}
<A>__{the e.m. takes up his stick and follows treves out. upstairs hallway the london hospital we see treves and fox alone at a window. they are looking down on the hospital square treves had previously crossed and see the e.m., lit by gaslight and moving to a waiting cab.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{you never mentioned his mental state.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{he's imbecile, no doubt from birth. he speaks, but... it's all gibberish. no, the man's a homeless idiot...}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{i pray god he's an idiot.}
<A>__{the e.m., as he is getting into the cab, stops, turns and looks to the upper stories of the hospital. treves and fox are joined by three laughing colleagues who clap treves on the back.}
<C>__{the first}
<D>__{quite a coup, freddie. you'll look splendid in the journal.}
<C>__{the second}
<D>__{where ever did you find that creature?}
<A>__{from the upper story we watch the cab drive away.}
<C>__{the third }
<D>__{it's a pity.}
<C>__{fox }
<D>__{i pity the poor cab driver, myself.}
<A>__{from outside the window we see treves surrounded by his laughing friends. entry hall treves' home we see a door. it opens and treves walks in. he shuts the door, locks it, goes to a coat rack on the wall and hangs up his overcoat and hat. he notices his reflection in a mirror and examines himself wearily. anne's smiling reflection appears beside his.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{did it go well, darling?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{yes, very well, i think. are the girls in bed?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{yes, and they send their kisses. would you like your sherry now?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{no, i think a whiskey.}
<A>__{we move past anne's reflection to a cu of treves. whitechapel night we now see a bunsen burner roar of flame reflected in bytes' eyes. pulling back we see bytes, quite drunk, sitting, cooking sausages over the hot brick. he takes another drink from his gin bottle. up comes a wet belch and he takes another drink. the e.m. is crouched against the wall with a bowl of potatoes and a cup of water in front of him. with his good hand, he is picking tiny pieces of potato and feeding himself. the eating is fairly loud and animal like. the drinking is even worse. the boy is across the room asleep, wrapped in ragged little blankets. the e.m. takes a drink of water, making a loud smacking, slurping sound. bytes looks up from his cooking with a smoldering look, just waiting for him to make the sound again. he does and bytes takes his crop and violently jabs him.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{belt up, you misbegotten garbage.}
<P>__{(mumbling to himself)}
<D>__{how can i eat with that?}
<A>__{bytes takes a mouthful of gin and mockingly slurps it mimicking the e.m.'s sound.}
<C>__{bytes}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{how can i eat with that?}
<A>__{the e.m. picks and eats some more and then drinks again very tentatively. because of his fear the water catches in his throat and he spits and coughs out onto the floor, gasping and wheezing for breath. bytes is up and whacks him with his riding crop.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{out of my sight!}
<A>__{the e.m. struggles to get up, carrying his food.}
<C>__{bytes}
<P>__{(not satisfied with his speed)}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{he jabs the e.m. again, spilling his potatoes and water onto the floor.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{you clumsy sod!}
<A>__{he pushes the e.m. again, then slips on the potatoes and falls heavily to the floor, crying out in shock. then rage hits him. the e.m. backs up.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{you!}
<A>__{the boy wakes up in fear. bytes moves quickly toward the e.m. raising his crop. the e.m. stumbles and falls backward onto the floor. his head goes back and he begins gasping for air. bytes yanks him up and hits him in the face with his riding crop. the force of the blow knocks a glob of spit into the air from the e.m.'s mouth. the e.m. gasps and wheezes horribly as bytes hits him again and again. from across the room.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{bytes! don't...}
<A>__{bytes goes right on with the beating.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{this won't do, my lad. this just won't do!}
<A>__{receiving room london hospital we see the eyes of the boy. as we pull back from them, they widen with recognition. wide shot of the receiving room. treves has entered and the boy walks quickly up to him.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{our man is sick. come right away.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{like this.}
<P>__{(he breathes heavily}
<D>__{in and out to demonstrate the e.m.'s}
<P>__{difficulty)}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i will get my bag.}
<B>__{inside the shop}
<A>__{we hear the sound of wheezing coming from the e.m. who is sitting propped up against the stage, wrapped in a blanket. his head bent forward toward his knees. bytes is going to the door as it opens and the boy leads treves in. treves immediately goes to the e.m.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{what did you do to him? he's been like this all night!}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{he was fine when he left here, and now look at him.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i intend to.}
<A>__{treves pulls the blanket away from the e.m. exposing several bruises and bloody cuts. treves freezes at the sight and slowly turns to look at bytes.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{he fell.}
<P>__{(guardedly)}
<D>__{he falls.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{he must have taken quite a fall.}
<A>__{he looks up at the riding crop in the hand of bytes, then to the strangely nervous and silent boy.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{he's a clumsy git. never watches where he is going.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{why is he sitting up like this? he needs rest.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{that's the way he sleeps. if he lays down, he'll die.}
<P>__{(he points to his}
<D>__{neck and leans his}
<P>__{head back)}
<D>__{head's too heavy.}
<A>__{treves turns his attention to the e.m. he lifts his head higher and examines the e.m.'s eyes. the e.m., who had been oblivious up until this point, looks into treves' eyes and recognizes him. with his good hand, he reaches up and touches treves' arm almost as if appealing to him. treves' eyes lock on his.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{this man belongs in hospital.}
<C>__{bytes}
<P>__{(apprehensively)}
<D>__{can't you fix him up here? ...he's my livelihood. listen.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{you listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. he's got the rale, he's very weak, and i don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall". now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.}
<A>__{bytes considers and then snaps his fingers at the boy who runs out. he then breaks into an ingratiating grin and leans down over treves who busily examines the wheezing e.m.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{i really appreciate this, guv. you know, there's lot of things that i can do for you. i move in the proper circles, for this type of thing...}
<P>__{(motioning toward the e.m.)}
<D>__{in fact, anything at all, if you take my meaning.}
<A>__{treves, uncomfortable, rises. bytes grips his hand and with the other gathers the material of his sleeve in a slow deliberate squeeze.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{i like doing business with you. you and i understand each other, completely. i know i can trust you. can't i?}
