<A>__{mr. johansen still sits with his feet up, reading. the next page's headline reads: first test tube baby born. trip runs up to mr. j's desk, one hand behind his back, the other on his crotch. his face is drawn in an expression of sheer agony. hawk and lex watch anxiously in the background.}
<C>__{mr.j}
<D>__{mr. verudi, get back to your bench.}
<A>__{trip puts one leg over the other always keeping a hand behind his back.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{but i gotta take a piss like you would not believe, mr. johansen!}
<C>__{mr.j}
<D>__{put a clothespin on it till the end of class, verudi. you know my rule.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{but ever since my doctor put me on salt pills, it's been like niagara falls every half hour! please, mr. j! have mercy!}
<A>__{suddenly, a wet stain grows across the crotch of trip's pants.}
<C>__{mr.j}
<D>__{salt pills? don't insult my intelligence, verudi...}
<A>__{mr. j. stops when he sees the stain starting to spread.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{jeezis, i'm taking a leak in my pants!}
<A>__{we now see trip is squeezing the pump from before. he holds it behind him feeding water into the tube running down the back of his pants. the stain travels fast, hitting trip's knee in a nanosecond. in a state of shock, mr. j. slowly opens a long forgotten drawer on his desk, finding a cobweb and dust covered pad of bathroom passes. he tears one off and dust flies everywhere. he holds the pass out to trip like it was a cross he was holding before an advancing vampire.}
<C>__{mr.j}
<P>__{(hoarsely)}
<D>__{get the hell out of here, verudi! you disgust me!}
<A>__{hawk and lex observe that trip has been successful, then do a three stooges style handshake, whispering "curly!"}
