<D>__{..here's tony blair, just 43 years old, arriving at the polling station of his constituency in sedgefield.."}
<A>__{queen elizabeth ii, wearing formal robes of the garter, is posing for an official portrait by an elderly black portrait artist, (representative, one assumes, of one of the many charities of which she is patron)..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{have you voted yet, mr crawford?}
<C>__{artist}
<P>__{(proudly dabbing palette)}
<D>__{yes, ma'am. i was there when they opened. first in line. seven o'clock.}
<C>__{commentary}
<D>__{if he wins, he'll be the youngest prime minister in almost two hundred years.."}
<A>__{he straightens..}
<C>__{artist}
<D>__{and i don't mind telling you, it wasn't for mr blair.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{not a moderniser, then?}
<C>__{artist}
<D>__{certainly not. we're in danger of losing too much that's good about this country as it is.}
<C>__{tv commentary}
<D>__{"the only questions that still remain: how big will his landslide be? and how extensive, how sweeping will the modernisation programme be that he ushers in?"}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{hmm.}
<A>__{the queen watches as he paints..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i rather envy you being able to vote.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{not the actual ticking of the box, although, i suppose, it would be nice to experience that once.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{but the sheer joy of being partial.}
<C>__{artist}
<D>__{yes..}
<A>__{the artist squints as he scrutinises the canvass..}
<C>__{artist}
<D>__{one forgets that as sovereign, you are not entitled to vote.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{artist}
<D>__{still, you won't catch me feeling sorry for you. you might not be allowed to vote, ma'am..}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{but it is your government.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the queen raises her eyebrow..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i suppose that is some consolation.}
