<C>__{uri}
<D>__{they say there are only two days you enjoy a boat, the day you buy it and the day you sell it.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{well, according to my figures that sounds about right, but what can you do?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{beauty is a cruel mistress.}
<A>__{he smiles, she is smart, he fancies her.}
<C>__{uri}
<D>__{i must remember that line. can i pour you a glass?}
<C>__{stella}

<C>__{uri }
<D>__{tell me, what do you do for fun?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{uri }
<D>__{have i offended you in some way?}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{i don't quite know where this is going and if you don't mind, i would like to keep our relationship professional.}
<A>__{there is a pause while uri is slightly lost for words. then he slams the table in excitement and looks up at victor who is standing in the distance.}
<C>__{uri}
<D>__{you see victor, this is what i am talking about.}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{this is what i like about this country. they understand hierarchy you do your job, i do mine and everyone gets along.}

<D>__{forgive me for being immodest mr omovich. i am a very good accountant, but i can only cover so much of your money, it does have to be accounted for after all. it is not easy to lose seven million to the tax man.}
<C>__{uri}
<D>__{but, if you are so good,....}

<C>__{stella}
