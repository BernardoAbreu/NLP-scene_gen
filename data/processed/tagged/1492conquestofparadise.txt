<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{from the beginning, columbus proved himself incapable of managing the affairs of the island. he appointed his brothers to important positions, at once injuring the pride and dignity of the nobles who had gone with him. he promised to build a city, the city of isabel, named after your majesty. what he actually built was nothing but a collection of huts, and that in the wrong place, for all of it was easily swept away by rain and mud. is that not so, brother buyl?}

<D>__{yes, your honor.}
