<A>__{preysing's room new angle. preysing is on his feet. he has replaced the receiver on the telephone, he is putting it back slowly. he is terrified. door opens behind him. flaemmchen, with a dressing gown on, light, filmy thing, crosses and looks down at the baron, without a word. preysing seizes her. her hand goes to her head, her eyes roll; for a moment we think she is going to faint right on top of the baron. she is trying to collect her senses, it cannot be true. we can hear nothing but the heavy breathing of preysing and the traffic below. suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident, it is the first time we have been conscious of it. with a swift movement, flaemmchen dashes towards the door. it is locked. she rushes back as if to cut through her own room. he reaches for her and rips her dressing gown from her, leaving her almost naked. he lunges after her. she tears through her own room.}
