<A>__{debbie, her mother and the girls enter the lobby. they approach the hotel manager, who is standing behind the front desk. they are dressed garishly, like hookers. debbie has on a cheap blonde wig and mini skirt. the manager looks at them the way one would look at an approaching plague.}

<D>__{room 1002.}
<A>__{the girls turn and start toward the elevator. mrs. thomerson, who is wearing the kind of push up bra that makes her tits look like the black hills, smiles at the manager seductively. he smiles back, then catches himself.}

<P>__{(to bellboy)}
<D>__{those guys are asking for it.}
<A>__{the girls cross to the elevator. ilene pushes the button and the doors swing open. they get inside and just before the doors close, a huge behemoth of a man joins them inside. he turns and faces camera. it's milt, rajah's beefy helper. he doesn't look happy as he eyes the girls. they look back at him uncomfortably as the doors slam shut.}
