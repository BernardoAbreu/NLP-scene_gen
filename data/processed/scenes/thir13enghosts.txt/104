<L>__{interior basement with arthur}
<A>__{kalina's legs disappear through the ceiling. arthur, holding out the flare, scans the basement around him. the figures still remain at bay. that's when the flare burns out. arthur shakes it once, twice, then, knowing it's out for good, stands alone, helpless in the single patch of light coming from the ceiling. he looks to his left and sees the crab like creature scurrying down the corridor. from the other direction comes a large silhouette (which is the hammer).}
