<L>__{interior bill cole's office day}
<A>__{a successful lawyer's office, the walls crowded with leather bound books. jim and muriel are seated facing the large desk behind which sits bill cole. bill finishes reading a series of papers, the sum total of correspondence between jim and mr. smith. he sets down the papers, leans back thoughtfully. jim and muriel look at him with nervous but eager anticipation.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(not too sure)}
<D>__{what do you think, bill? steal, huh?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(drily)}
<D>__{it certainly is.}
<A>__{jim looks triumphantly at muriel.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{perhaps "steal" is an understatement "swindle" might be a little more appropriate.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(with pride)}
<D>__{well, it wasn't much, bill. i just saw a good thing and i }
<P>__{(take)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{every time you get a little tight you weep on my shoulder about the advertising business and how it forces a sensitive soul like yourself to make a living by bamboozling the american public.}
<P>__{(picks up smith's correspondence)}
<D>__{i would say that a small part of this victimized group has now redressed the balance.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you! you've been taken to the cleaners and you don't even know your pants are off!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{dear, i told you. i said we should call bill }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{never mind, muriel!}
<P>__{(to bill; challengingly)}
<D>__{all right, just what's wrong with this deal?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{first time around you offered ten thousand dollars for fifty acres, right?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what of it?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's two hundred dollars an acre. i know that part of connecticut and one hundred dollars an acre is standard top gouge price to city slickers. when the natives sell to each other it's around forty or less.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{forty dollars an acre!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{the man's entitled to a fair profit.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{not two hundred and eighty four percent.}
<P>__{(indicates papers)}
<D>__{and besides, you're not getting fifty acres, you're only getting thirty five, more or less.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{where does it say that?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(picks up letter)}
<D>__{i refer to a rather obscure post script on the back of the second letter from friend smith.}
<A>__{he hands the letter to muriel.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"incidentally, mr. hackett has been a little over optimistic about the acreage. it will probably survey somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty five acres, more or less, but i feel sure..."}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(on the defensive)}
<D>__{all right, so it's thirty five! what's the difference? do you know how many tennis courts you can get on thirty five acres?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you're not spending eleven thousand five hundred dollars for tennis courts!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that's not the point!}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(very businesslike)}
<D>__{that's precisely the pointerior we're going to write this hackett a strong letter and tell him he can either kick in with those fifteen acres, reduce the price, or find another sucker.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(rising emotion)}
<D>__{we'll do no such thing! i'm not going to queer this deal over fifteen broken down acres!}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{we were just going window shopping and so far it's cost us eleven thousand five hundred dollars and they even made us pay the commission!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you don't understand business.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you mean extortion.}
<A>__{as jim turns on bill and is about to answer him explosively:}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{i wonder if we could get another two year lease on the apartment?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(heatedly)}
<D>__{now wait a minute! you can't measure everything on a slide rule. this house has certain intangibles.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{like what, for instance?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{like antique value, for instance! it just so happens that general gates stopped right there, at that very house, to water his horses.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i don't care if general grant dropped in for a scotch and soda you're still getting rocked!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that was a different war!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{i think bill's absolutely right.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(struggling to contain himself; quietly)}
<D>__{let me explain something. to both of you. for fifteen years i've been cooped up in a four room cracker box! just getting shaved in the morning entitles a man to the congressional medal for bravery.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that doesn't make this a good buy.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{bill muriel and i have found what i am not ashamed to call our dream house. it's like a fine painting. you buy it with your heart, not your head. you don't ask, how much was the canvas, how much was the paint? you look at it and you say, "it's beautiful... i want it," and if it costs a few pennies more you pay it and gladly because you love it and you can't measure the things you love in dollars and cents!}
<A>__{muriel looks at jim, impressed, her face softening with compassion.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(emotionally spent)}
<D>__{well that's how i feel about this place. and when i sign those papers saturday, i can look the world in the face and say, "it's mine! my house! my home! my thirty five acres!"}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(coming over; moved, touched)}
<D>__{our house. our home. our thirty five acres...}
<A>__{they tenderly kiss.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{...more or less...}
<A>__{on jim's reaction:}
