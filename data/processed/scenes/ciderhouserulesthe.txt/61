<L>__{interior stairway corridor day}
<A>__{homer runs up the stairs, two steps at a time; he races into a corridor at full speed, exhilarated. suddenly dr. larch appears in front of him. homer stops abruptly, out of breath, unable to speak.}
<L>__{interior larch's office day}
<A>__{as homer stands guiltily, larch rifles through an x ray file, holding various x rays up to the lit screen. he quickly finds the one he's looking for, attaching it briefly to the screen for a confirming look a heart x ray, which larch waves at homer as he talks.}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least useful thing it is that you find to do.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(restrained)}
<D>__{i wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless i expect i will find some ways to be of use.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{in other parts of the world, i suppose there are other ways.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(still restrained)}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(blows up)}
<D>__{are you really so stupid that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? what you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here only nobody takes care of them as well! and you won't be able to take care of them, either. there's no taking care of anybody not out there!}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(feeling trapped)}
<D>__{you know i'm grateful for everything you've done for me...}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{i don't need your gratitude.}
<A>__{larch hands homer the heart x ray.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{i don't need this i know all about my condition.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{it's your heart you ought to take it with you.}
