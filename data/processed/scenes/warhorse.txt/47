<A>__{ gunther is now with joey and topthorn. near a wooden ambulance which is like a giant wagon to carry humans. he is with michael, a very young soldier, his brother possibly as young as 14. gunther lifts a heavy pulling harness and tries to get topthorn into it.}

<D>__{it won't work they're cavalry}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{let's try.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you won't get the harness on.}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{come on, michael.}
<A>__{topthorn balks violently.}
<C>__{gunther }
<D>__{whoa, whoa. easy, now, easy now, englishman... whoa, whoa, whoa. easy now, easy.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{gunther! it's hopeless we can't help them.}
<A>__{and suddenly joey moves up and presents himself, with his strange self assurance and self sacrifice. and instinct for survival. he sniffs the harness and places his head through it, which helps to calm topthorn enough that gunther can slip the collar onto the big black horse. gunther turns to joey, impressed.}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{well, well, look at you. whoever taught you this has just saved your life.}
<A>__{gunther spots the red ribbon in joey's saddle, removes it, folds it, and places it in his pocket. later gunther and michael are returning from the battlefield with topthorn and joey, pulling an ambulance with british and german wounded. amongst the wounded, we see a hand gripping a battered, silk lined hat. it is waverly, wounded but alive.}
