<L>__{interior george & doris' house day}
<D>__{the next morning, he's having breakfast with his wife. the atmosphere is still dreadful but this time he's not making any effort either. he disdainfully watches doris eat. she is cutting up strawberries using a knife and fork. george watches her, smiles and continues to watch. except it's not doris he's watching. instead it's peppy who's tucking into her food and talking and laughing vivaciously. george is with her with an expression of love on his face. he's laughing with her when, suddenly, reality bites. he's still sitting opposite doris, and she's staring at him because she doesn't understand why he is laughing. she visibly finds him ridiculous. he stops laughing and breakfast carries on as normal.}
