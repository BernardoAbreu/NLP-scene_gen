<L>__{interior torture room #1}
<A>__{close on a young woman's eye. bloodshot blue. her eyelashes tremble. a tear rolls out. she blinks. close on a filthy, coarse rope secures a dirty rag inside her mouth. close on the same type rope binds her ankles together. close on her hands a mixture of blood, dirt. iron spikes}
<B>__{are nailed through her palms.}
<A>__{from above the young woman, 20s, wearing a handmade dress with a small crest embroidered over the heart, lies nailed to a wooden table. an overhead light bulb dims, crackles. off screen: a blood curdling scream cries out. the young woman's breathing intensifies. she watches the light bulb, listens to the screams. the light bulb returns to normal. the screams stop. peace for a moment. but she knows that won't last.}
<L>__{interior torture room #2}
<A>__{a young man, 20s, hangs by his wrists from iron shackles secured to the ceiling. he's bloodied, bruised... a mess. close on the end of a pair of jumper cables. they touch, sending sparks into the air. brought together by... a concealed figure. all that's visible are his hands. his left hand is severely burned, scarred, while his right appears normal. he touches the jumper cables together again... sparks fly.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{please please stop. d don't.}
<A>__{the concealed figure ignores his pleas, connects the left cable to one shackle chain... and then the right side.}
<B>__{electricity surges through the body of the young man. his}
<A>__{body contorts. he screams. the lights dim and crackle.}
<L>__{interior torture room #1}
<A>__{close on the light bulb dulls. the screams of the young man echo through the room. the young woman closes her eyes. takes several fast breaths then... musters every ounce of strength in her body and... her right hand trembles... the young woman grimaces, in unbelievable agony, but then... her right hand inches up the iron spike. slowly and painfully. pieces of blood, skin and bone cling to spike as the hand moves up. the light bulb returns again to normal. the screams stop. the young woman gives a final hard push and... frees her right hand. blood pours from the wound. no time to waste. she turns her attention, strength to her left hand... ever so slowly (and painfully) it moves.}
<L>__{interior torture room #2}
<A>__{close on the jumper cable attaches to the metal and... electricity surges through the young man's body. he screams.}
<L>__{interior cabin torture room #1}
<A>__{the young woman's left hand pops free. blood oozes out. off screen: screams from the young man. she sits up, goes for the gag, but her fingers cramp in pain. finally, she unties the knot, removes the gag. she coughs, tries to muffle the noise best she can. the screams stop. lights return to normal. half way free. she goes for the ropes at her ankles, unties them, slides off the table. she grabs a couple rags, ties them around her palm's wounds.}
<L>__{interior hallway torture room #2}
<A>__{the young woman opens the door, checks to see if the coast is clear. it is. we're at the end of a long, dark hallway (more like a tunnel, really). there are two more doors in the hall, one in front of her another to her right. the door across from her is slightly ajar... young woman's pov thru door the young man dangles from the chains. suddenly, the concealed figure appears between the door and the young man. the young woman retreats, but realizes the concealed figure has his back to her. the young man sees past the figure, locks eyes with the young woman. no hope for himself, his eyes say: save yourself. the young woman fights back tears, mouths the words "i love you". she carefully opens the door to her right, reveal a rickety set of wooden steps. she heads up, just as... lights flicker. off screen: the young man screams again. the young woman quickens her pace. the screams drown out any sound, until... just before she touches the top step... the lights return to normal. the young man stops screaming. the place goes silent. the young woman's foot touches the step... a loud creak rings out. the young woman freezes. torture room #2 the concealed figure turns towards the sound. hallway, stairs the young woman holds her breath. did he hear her? torture room #2 a steel axe sickle hybrid (a scary, handmade invention), rusted, save for the razor sharp edge, sticks in a nearby wooden horse. the concealed figure snatches the weapon.}

<A>__{sarah races through the thick forest. her bare, bloody feet and legs stomping over the hard dirt, branches, shrubs, anything in her way. not too far behind... the concealed figure... (the majority of him still hidden) follows her. weapon in hand. sarah... pushes through some thick brush, but... trips, falls. she screams in pain, grabs her foot, notices... a large gash across the bottom. sarah turns, hears... the concealed figure.. approaches in the distance. sarah... wills herself up, limp runs away.}
<L>__{exterior forest clearing cliff sunset}
<A>__{sarah exits the thick woods to discover, to her horror... she stands at the edge of a cliff, takes a peek over the side... sarah's pov jagged rocks and a small stream at the bottom,}
<L>__{200 feet below. a waterfall flows steadily nearby.}
<A>__{before sarah can fully digest the situation... the concealed figure exits the forest, spins the weapon in his hand. anticipating its use. sarah freezes in her spot. breaths get shorter, heavier. her eyes dart in every direction. what to do? the concealed figure takes one step forward and... sarah jumps off the cliff. rather that fate than the other. the concealed figure walks up to the edge, looks over... at the bottom... sarah's dead body lays twisted and bloody among the rocks. the waterfall crashes next to her. blood mixes with the water turning it a deep red. cue title: timber falls...}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{for first timers, i recommend either willow creek bridge or donner trail.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{donner trail? as in "the donner party?"}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm not sure of the name's origin. they're the two paths we regularly patrol. something happens and you're on one of the other trails, it might be awhile before we find you.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{where do we camp?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{unless it says not to, you can set up where you like. just make sure when you turn in that you extinguish your fire. oh, and this here's bear country. they're not animals to fool with. you see one, you head the other way, especially if he's feeding. if the bear thinks you're getting in the way of his food, that's all she wrote.}
<A>__{sheryl warily eyes the stuffed bear in the station.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{great.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{great, see how easy that was.}
<P>__{(moving on)}
<D>__{it's off season, park's pretty quiet. even more than usual. you may run into a few locals, but }
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{people live up here?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we have a few generations of families that have called these mountains home. most of `em are friendly. respect their land and they'll respect you.}
<A>__{mike twangs and air banjos, "dueling banjos" from `deliverance.' sam is not amused. sheryl fights her temptation to laugh.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(moving on)}
<D>__{base is just outside, to the left. at about two miles up there'll be a junction where you can pick your path.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{thanks.}

<L>__{exterior parking lot, ranger station day}
<A>__{mike digs through his backpack, double checking everything. what he doesn't show sheryl... wrapped in some socks: a .38 revolver. he tucks it discreetly away. sheryl checks her bag as well. she clips a blue hikers' towel to her waist. mike checks his cell phone. no service.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you getting anything?}
<A>__{sheryl checks her phone and shakes her head "no."}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i will lock them in the car.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{i will take mine.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{just to annoy you.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{seriously...}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{in an emergency, i'd rather have a phone that may not work up there, than not have a phone that may work up there.}
<A>__{huh? mike shakes his head, puts his phone in the glove compartment. sheryl tucks her phone and the flier into a side pocket of her backpack. zips it shut. angle on mike's keys and his boston red sox key chain. mike locks the door.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{okay, we all set?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{yup.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{let's do this.}
<A>__{mike pulls on his backpack, starts walking. sheryl doesn't move. she eyes their tent still resting on the car's roof.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{hey, einstein. what do you think, leave the tent or maybe take it with us?}
<A>__{mike swallows his pride and retreats to the car.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i was just seeing if you were paying attention.}
<A>__{mike comes back to the car for the tent. sheryl shakes her head and smiles.}
<L>__{exterior base trail #1 day}
<A>__{the mountain is breathtaking. nature at its best. mike and sheryl have begun their ascent.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{it could be fun.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{not a chance. high school reunions serve only two purposes... to try to}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{rehash so called glory days if you were popular or to gloat if you were a spaz and are now filthy rich, banging a super model.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{so what were you?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{me? i was a stoner.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{so what does that mean?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{how the hell am i supposed to remember? i was high all the time.}
<A>__{sheryl swallows some water, checks her compass. sweat rolls down mike's forehead, stinging his eyes. sheryl doesn't have that problem. she's wearing a red bandana.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{where'd you get that bandana?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{it's cute, right? i stopped by that army navy store on grover yesterday. keeps the sweat out of your eyes.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{and when you were buying it, you didn't think that maybe...}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{oh...well...it was the last one...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{the last one?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{the entire army navy store... sold out?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{completely. there was some sort of run on bandanas at the last minute.}
<A>__{sheryl stifles a chuckle. mike shakes his head, then... she pulls out a gray bandana, hands it to him.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{here... you big baby.}
<A>__{sheryl turns, as she does... mike pinches her behind, she playfully shrieks, hustles away from him, but he pursues her, as they both crack up, they spill off the trail... off the path... mike and sheryl continue their horseplay, when... sheryl looks down, screams! a bloody, mutilated fox lays inside a rusted bear trap. the steel jaws of the trap have sliced the body in two. the kill looks fresh.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{fucking nasty.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{looks like it's a, or was, a fox. come on.}
<A>__{mike and sheryl head back to the path. angle on the mutilated, bloody fox.}
<L>__{exterior bridge on base trail day}
<A>__{mike and sheryl hike over a small wooden bridge.}
<L>__{exterior base trail #2 day}
<A>__{mike and sheryl reach a small clearing. there are a number of signs pointing toward different trails. (donner trail, willow creek bridge, timber falls, etc.) sheryl grabs the map and some water. mike swigs some water, munches on trail mix, takes a peek in the guidebook.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{what do you think? "cannibal" trail or the other one?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{guidebook says a couple of these other trails lead to some pretty sweet views.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{we're not lewis and or clark. we're gonna stick to one of the ones the ranger said.}
<C>__{ida }
<D>__{you folks need some help?}
<A>__{ida foster, 40s, approaches, wheeling some supplies in a handmade wagon. she is worn, haggard, but has a friendly, smile. she wears a flannel shirt, old jeans and dirty boots.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we're just going over our options here.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{well, take it from me, any way you choose, you can't go wrong.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{the ranger at base suggested donner trail or...}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{...willow creek bridge. i think sam only knows those two trails. well. between those, i'd pick donner trail. willow creek will shoot you to the top, but there's not as much to see. donner weaves through peddler's point, it's a better hike and prettier all around view.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<P>__{(to mike)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{then, she notices a ring on sheryl's finger.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{that's a pretty ring.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{not your traditional wedding ring, but it's all the same in the lord's eyes. how long have you two been wed?}
<A>__{sheryl and mike trade looks.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{oh... we're not married. not yet anyway.}
<A>__{mike shoots her a look: "not yet?"}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{it's a ring my father gave me for graduation.}
<C>__{ida}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. you just looked like you was married is'all. both so beautiful.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm just an old fashioned silly bird. i need to mind my own business.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{no, it's fine.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(changing topics)}
<D>__{which one of those trails got the best clearings?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{clearings? neither will give you much in the way of clearings. but, there's another path, this one here.}
<P>__{(points to the map)}
<D>__{timber falls. its got some beautiful vistas and one of the prettiest falls you'll ever see.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sounds perfect.}
<P>__{(to sheryl)}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{well, i will leave you to it. last thing you need is me fussing'round you, taking you from your private time.}
<C>__{sheryl mike}
<A>__{thank you. yeah, thanks for the tip. ida walks off, but stops only a few feet away.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i'm just gonna say it and go, but if you two were to marry... i bet the lord would bless you with a happy, healthy and handsome child. good luck and god bless you both.}
<A>__{sheryl and mike don't know how to respond. ida leaves. once out of earshot...}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{i suddenly feel the need for confession.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(still lingering on...)}
<D>__{not yet? love taking your shots, don't ya?}
<A>__{sheryl shoots him a stern, but playfully sexy, look.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{when i see an opening.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(checks map)}
<D>__{that path she was talking about winds through these falls. what do you think?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{i think... if you get eaten by a bear and there isn't a ranger around, i'm not carrying what's left of you down this mountain.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{and they say romance is dead.}
<P>__{(smiling wide)}
<D>__{timber falls it is.}
<A>__{they throw on their backpacks and head on their way.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{who's lewis and or clark?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{you really were stoned through high school.}
<A>__{as mike and sheryl trek up the path... angle on the directional sign, "timber falls"}
<L>__{exterior timber falls trail #1 day}
<A>__{looking back down on the thin path. find sheryl and mike continuing their trek. (splinter unit) mike maneuvers around a massive tree. he freezes. gestures for sheryl to be quiet and mouths the words, "don't move." sheryl stops, startled. mike motions towards... a mountain stag, with magnificent antlers, chews on a plant in the distance. sheryl quietly slides out her digital camera. snaps a photo of the animal. the stag stops chewing and looks at them. after a long beat, the stag skips away through the trees. sheryl watches the animal disappear, smiles. mike removes his backpack and crosses to sheryl. he helps remove her backpack and kisses her. she kisses him back. angle on sheryl's heart shaped locket through her shirt.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you're going to lose that out here.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{it's fine. i never take it off. not since you gave it to me. betcha don't remember...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{...february 27, 2006.}
<A>__{sheryl stares incredulously, romantically at mike. speechless.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i remember every moment with you.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{i've got you so whipped.}
<A>__{they kiss. sheryl climbs onto mike's lap. he leans back, better positioning, places his hand down, when...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{ouch! fuck!}
<A>__{mike brings his hand back up. blood trickles out of a small}
<T>__{cut :}
<A>__{across his palm.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{my hand... something stuck it.}
<A>__{sheryl quickly examines the cut. mike quickly becomes flustered, woozy. he turns away from the wound.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{it's okay. it's not too deep. let me get the first aid kit.}
<A>__{sheryl rummages through her bag. mike, in more psychological discomfort than physical, looks away wincing. sheryl returns, wipes the blood away best she can. she applies some peroxide...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{fuck. that stung.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{gotta clean the wound, baby.}
<A>__{obscured pov through trees from a distance... a sickle blade enters frame, pulls a branch aside. sheryl attends to mike's wound. the pov narrows... solely on sheryl. timber falls, trail #1 mike looks at sheryl, a twinge of embarrassment in his eyes.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you know me and blood... we don't do so well.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(she finishes)}
<D>__{all done.}
<A>__{off screen: crunch of something stepping on a thicket. sheryl glances toward the sound. mike admires the dressing of the wound.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{not bad, nightingale. not bad at all.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{did you hear something?}
<A>__{mike follows her eye line. there's a softer crunch.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{it's probably the deer.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{the deer went in the other direction.}
<A>__{mike's demeanor suddenly becomes cold, creepy.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{maybe it's someone, or something, stalking us.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{quit it.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{something inhuman watching our every move.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{i said, knock it off.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{you're an asshole.}

"five corners" will be perfect. it's just a bit up the ways here, near the lake. it's five large rocks which sit in a clearing with a view of the whole park. the rocks retain the heat from the day, so if you set up camp between them you won't be so cold.}
