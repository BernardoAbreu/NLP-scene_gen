<A>__{a car pulls up... jenkins steps out. stares out over the scene, the mess. he's a volcano ready to erupt.}

<A>__{a series of eight black and white video monitors... as we rewind. seven of the eight show recorded images of the bank. the eighth shows only static. dax sits in front of the monitors. conners stands nearby.}

<P>__{(re: the eighth monitor)}
<D>__{what's with this one?}
<C>__{dax}
<D>__{that's the camera in the vault. it blew in the first explosion.}
<A>__{the seven different monitors all begin in sync. on screen... timecode burns in the corner. the hostages are dragged across the lobby, where the black clads hook them up to the pulleys. the black clads get into position. conners carefully scrutinizes the images. on screen... the timecode clock: hits "11:15:00 am" and... static fills the screens!}

<D>__{that's when you cut the power.}

<D>__{they're long gone by then.}
