<L>__{exterior campsite ii, pacific crest trail night}
<A>__{a burning log collapses in chris' campfire, reduced to glowing embers.}
<L>__{interior tent}
<A>__{chris is awakened by the sound of twigs snapping in a nearby thicket. he quickly grabs a knife from his backpack, unzips six inches of the tent door open. we see his eyes peering out. the crackling moves closer. his grip on the knife tightens. suddenly a hot white light hits his face. and a voice comes from behind the light.}
<C>__{forest ranger}
<D>__{u.s. forestry. could you step out of the tent please?}
<A>__{now we see the forest ranger appear from the thicket. chris exits the tent, catching himself holding the knife.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(as he drops the knife to the ground)}
<D>__{sorry. i thought you were a bear.}
<C>__{forest ranger}
<P>__{(approaching)}
<D>__{i don't blame you. you're less than a hundred yards from the nearest den. that's why i came over here to talk to you. do you have some identification?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{no. i'm sorry. my name's alex. i've been travelling a lot and i got robbed and my identification was taken.}
<C>__{forest ranger}
<D>__{you mind if i take a look in your tent?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{the forest ranger bends over. pops his flashlight through the tent door and peers around a bit before re addressing chris.}
<C>__{forest ranger}
<D>__{you're not the character who knocked down our sign, are ya?}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(giggles)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{forest ranger}
<D>__{because there was a sign indicating that camping was allowed by permit only.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{well, i don't have a permit.}
<C>__{forest ranger}
<D>__{no, i'm sure you don't. listen, it looks like you've got your food secured pretty good, so i'm not gonna make you move on tonight. but, these bears out here are nursing young and you know how that goes. next time, stop at the rangers station and get yourself a permit.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{alright. i appreciate it. i'm gonna be headed towards the coast tomorrow.}
<C>__{forest ranger}
<D>__{be careful.}
<A>__{they shake hands and the forest ranger disappears into the thicket.}
