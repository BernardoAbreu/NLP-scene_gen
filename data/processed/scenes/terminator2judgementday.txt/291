<A>__{open, and flying shrapnel whizzes all around him. before the thunderclap has faded terminator walks into the fire and smoke. john goes back to work without missing a beat. sarah and a stunned dyson walk through the burning doorframe into the artificial intelligence lab. a siren is sounding. the halon fire control system has been triggered. the invisible gas roars in, putting out the flames.}

<D>__{fire's set off the halo system! here... hurry!}
<A>__{dyson runs to a wall cabinet and pulls out some breathing masks. he hands one to sarah and dons the other. then he reaches out to hand one to terminator.}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{here!}
<A>__{terminator doesn't need a mask, since is oxygen requirements are so low. he ignores dyson as he removes his massive backpack and opens it. dyson shrugs and tosses the mask on a desk. he turns to sarah.}

<D>__{we'll have to keep these on a couple minutes, till the gas clears.}
<A>__{terminator pulls two five gallon jerry cans of gasoline from his pack. sarah starts pulling out book sized, olive grab claymore mines, stacking them next to the gasoline. dyson stares. part of him can't believe they're really doing this.}
