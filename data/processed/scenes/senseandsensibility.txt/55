<A>__{brandon strides along in hunting gear, a gun slung under one arm, his dog trotting behind him with a duck clamped between its jaws. the bulrushes catch his eye and he slows, then stops. he stands for a moment deep in thought. then he takes his hunting knife, cuts one and walks off contemplatively.}
<L>__{exterior barton park gardens day}
<A>__{an outdoor luncheon is in progress. colonel brandon is talking to mrs dashwood. occasionally he looks over towards marianne, who is playing bilboquet with sir john and margaret. mrs jennings nudges elinor hard and gestures to brandon.}

<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{how long have you known the colonel?}
<C>__{mrs jennings}

<D>__{ he has a tragic history. he loved a girl once twenty years ago now a ward to his family, but they were not permitted to marry...}
<A>__{elinor is intrigued.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{on what grounds?}
<C>__{mrs jennings}

<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{what became of the lady?}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{oh, she was passed from man to man disappeared from all good society. when brandon got back from india he searched for heaven knows how long, only to find her dying in a poor house. you have seen how it has affected him. once i thought my daughter charlotte might have cheered him up, but she is much better off where she is.}
<A>__{elinor is silent with amazement at this unexpected history.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}

<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{perhaps you did not know, miss marianne, that our dear brandon shares your passion for music and plays the piano forte very well.}
<A>__{marianne looks at brandon in some surprise.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}

<A>__{brandon looks at mrs jennings warningly but she ignores him.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
