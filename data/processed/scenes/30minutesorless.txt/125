<A>__{will. shirtless. could be anywhere. chet approaches and sits beside him.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{fucking nine dollars to use the internet.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{police think it was that black guy. they found some kind of map in his car. and i'm sure racial profiling played a part.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{but nothing about us?}
<C>__{chet}

<C>__{will}
<D>__{i was thinking we'd stick around a little a longer.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{why? so you have more time to delude my sister?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yes. and it'd be easier if you gave us five fucking minutes alone.}
