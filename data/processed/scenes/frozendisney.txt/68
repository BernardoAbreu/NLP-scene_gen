<A>__{the present: elsa's face sinks in pain.}
<C>__{elsa}

<A>__{elsa turns and heads up the second story steps.}
<C>__{elsa }
<D>__{goodbye, anna.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{elsa, wait }
<C>__{elsa}
<P>__{(calling back)}
<D>__{i'm just trying to protect you.}

<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you don't have to protect me. i'm not afraid. please don't shut me out again.}
<A>__{anna sings.}
<D>__{"first time in forever, reprise"}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{please don't slam the door. you don't have to keep your distance anymore. `cause for the first time in forever, i finally understand. for the first time in forever, we can fix this hand in hand. we can head down this mountain together. you don't have to live in fear. `cause for the first time in forever, i will be right here.}
<A>__{they arrive on the top floor, elsa's main living space. elsa turns back to anna, grateful, but determined.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{anna, please go back home. your life awaits. go enjoy the sun and open up the gates.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yeah, but }
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{i know! you mean well, but leave me be. yes, i'm alone but i'm alone and free.}
<A>__{elsa opens up the balcony doors.}
<C>__{elsa }
<D>__{just stay away and you'll be safe from me.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{actually, we're not.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{what do you mean you're not?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i get the feeling you don't know?}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{what do i not know?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{arendelle's in deep deep deep deep snow.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{elsa looks past anna's shoulder out white peaked mountains.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{everywhere?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's okay, you can just unfreeze it.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{no, i can't. i don't know how.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{sure you can. i know you can.}
<A>__{snow starts to swirl around the room.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{cuz for the first time in forever,}
<C>__{elsa}
<P>__{(panicking)}
<D>__{i'm such a fool! i can't be free!}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you don't have to be afraid.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{no escape from the storm inside of me!}
<A>__{the snow picks up. anna tries to fight through it.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{we can work this out together.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{i can't control the curse!}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{we'll reverse the storm you've made.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{anna, please, you'll only make it worse!}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{don't panic.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{there's so much fear!}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{we'll make the sun shine bright.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{you're not safe here!}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{we can face this thing together...}
<A>__{but as anna sings, we lose sight of her in the thickening blizzard taking over the room.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{we can change this winter weather, and everything will be...}
<A>__{anna's voice disappears in the storm as elsa cries out.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{i can't!}
<A>__{elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake. anna is struck right in the heart. she grasps her chest in pain and stumbles back. she falls to her knees. elsa gasps when she sees anna. just then, olaf and kristoff rush into the room to anna's side.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{anna. are you okay?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm okay.... i'm fine.}
<A>__{anna gets to her feet, determined to hide the pain.}
<C>__{elsa}
<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{who's this? wait, it doesn't matter. you have to go.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, i know we can figure this out together }
<C>__{elsa}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{how? what power do you have to stop this winter? to stop me?}
<A>__{anna doesn't have the answer. kristoff sees spiky ice shadows creeping down the walls. puts a protective arm around anna.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{anna, i think we should go.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(close to tears)}
<D>__{no. i'm not leaving without you, elsa.}
<C>__{elsa}
<P>__{(heartbroken but decisive)}
<D>__{yes, you are.}
<A>__{elsa waves her arms and builds a giant, menacing snowman. we'll call him marshmallow.}
