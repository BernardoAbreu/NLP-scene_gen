<L>__{interior harmsway's office }
<A>__{the door opens and harmsway enters, followed by bond. he calls to someone we don't see:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{hello, dear. i'm sorry i took so long }
<A>__{reveal: sidney is sitting across from his desk.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{that's okay, uncle ell }
<A>__{she freezes in mid sentence, seeing bond. bond is equally surprised.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what is he doing here?}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{i see you two have met.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{briefly.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<P>__{(crossing to his desk)}
<D>__{don't pout, sidney. i invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. he's from 'lloyd's of london.'}
<P>__{(sly glance to bond)}
<D>__{...aren't you, mr. bond?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{he's not going to tell the truth! he was diving for the gold!}
<A>__{harmsway sits, and addresses bond, matter of factly:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{it seems mr. bond that miss winch has told me the most incredible story: a sunken british warship filled with gold; a british cutter firing on her; billions of dollars in bullion lying on the bottom of the strait.}
<A>__{bond isn't enjoying this charade.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{obviously, the british government denies all of this }
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{ i told you! he was there! }
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{ but as i've explained to sidney, without proof, there's just no story. don't you agree mr. bond?}
<A>__{before bond can answer }
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{but i have proof! you ran out of here so fast, i didn't get to show you.}
<A>__{bond and harmsway react with entirely different concerns: harmsway wasn't expecting her to have proof; bond knows that if she shows him the gold, (or worse, the uranium tooth,) harmsway will probably kill both of them to destroy the evidence, and witnesses.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<P>__{(forcing a smile)}
<D>__{...and what's that, my dear?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{sidney, perhaps we should leave this to }
<A>__{sidney cuts bond off, dropping the gold bar on harmsway's desk.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{he brought that up from the wreck.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{...i see.}
<A>__{alarmed, bond wants to stop sidney from reaching into her bag again }
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{sidney, i wouldn't }
<A>__{too late. she drops the uranium tooth on his desk.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{and what about this? any idea what this is?}
<A>__{silence. harmsway and bond exchange a sober look. then:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{... i believe it's a depleted uranium drill bit, my dear.}
<A>__{he presses an alarm under his desk. bond reaches for the drill tooth.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{why don't we just take these }
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(blocking him)}
<D>__{no. i want sir elliot to keep them.}
<A>__{harmsway stands, comes around the desk:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{...well! i do believe this requires further investigation!}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{thank you, uncle elliot.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{no matter what the british government says, i won't kill this story.}
<P>__{(his secretary appears in the doorway)}
<D>__{miss oxford will show both of you to the elevator... and one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i'm sure they will.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{good bye, mister bond.}
<A>__{he reaches to kiss sidney and looks in her eyes a second too long.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{good bye, darling.}
<A>__{watching them exit, his smile turns hard and bitter.}
