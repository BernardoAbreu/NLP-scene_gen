<A>__{holmes enters. an anonymous man sits in the other seat.}
<C>__{anonymous man}
<D>__{i'm afraid you'll have to put this on.}
<A>__{he holds a black hood. holmes shrugs.}
<T>__{cut to black: fade in:}
<L>__{interior temple of four orders headquarters}
<A>__{the hood is pulled off. holmes takes in the scene, eyes flicking around the room. he's in a grand office where a man in his late 60s, sir thomas, rises from a pile of papers.}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{mr. holmes, apologies for summoning you like this. i'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are, and who i am.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{as to where i am i was, admittedly, lost for a moment between charing cross and holborn. but i was saved by the bread shop on saffron hill, the only bakers to use a certain french glaze on their loaves. after that, the carriage forked left, then right, a bump over the fleet conduit need i go on?}
<A>__{somewhat stunned, sir thomas shakes his head.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{as to who you are that took every ounce of my not inconsiderable experience and skill... the letters on your desk are addressed to sir thomas rotheram, lord chief justice. that would be your official title. who you realy are is another matter entirely.}
<A>__{sir thomas is not in the mood for this but holmes is on a roll.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{judging by the sacred ox on your ring, you're also the secret head of the temple of the four orders in whose headquarters we now stand, on the northwest corner of st. james square.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and as to the mystery the mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me in the first place.}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{yes, well, it's standard procedure, i suppose.}
<A>__{holmes shakes his head; what a massive lack of judgement on their part.}
<C>__{standish }
<D>__{i think we have the right man.}
<A>__{holmes turns to see john standish and lord coward standing behind him. standish is an american in his sixties. coward is a hard, ambitious man in his 30s.}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{sherlock holmes, ambassador standish from america and lord coward, the home secretary.}
<A>__{holmes acknowledges them barely as they enter. he isn't impressed by rank.}
<C>__{lord coward}
<D>__{i suppose you already have some notion as to the practices of our order?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{yes. they're almost interesting.}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{be as skeptical as you like but our secret systems have steered the world towards the greater good for centuries. the danger is that they can also be exploited for more nefarious purposes.}
<C>__{lord coward}
<D>__{what some call the dark arts, or practical magic.}
<A>__{holmes looks around the room, sees flags on the walls with ancient symbols, variations of the sphinx.}
<C>__{standish}
<D>__{we know you're are a rationalist. we don't ask you to share our faith, only our fears.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{fear is the more infectious condition.}
<P>__{(at sir thomas)}
<D>__{in this case, fear of your own child.}
<A>__{that shocks them rigid.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{blackwood is your son, yes? you have the same colored irises a rare dark green, with diamond shaped hazel flecks }
<C>__{holmes }
<P>__{(pointing at sir thomas' ear)}
<D>__{ plus identical outer ears, or pinna, which only pass down through the direct bloodline, which would make you either brothers, or, more likely, father and son.}
<A>__{stunned, the men consult silently, come to some sort of conclusion. they turn back to holmes. sir thomas seems especially shaken.}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{very few people are privy to that information, and we want to keep it that way.}
<A>__{sir thomas opens a bureau, digs for something.}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{he was conceived during one of our rituals. his mother wasn't my wife, but she shared our beliefs. she was a powerful practitioner. though not enough to survive giving birth to him.}
<A>__{holmes is appalled and shows it.}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{we were young. it was before we fully understood the powers we were dealing with.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{evidently.}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{death followed him wherever he went, from his birth to arms he made and sold. what family he had tended to... not survive. no one could prove anything of course, but we all knew }
