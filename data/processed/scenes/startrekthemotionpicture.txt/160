<L>__{interior bridge}
<A>__{uhura with sulu and chekov there.}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{problem, captain: the response signal is not in our records. voyager six was sent out by earth's "united states subdivision.' the code was probably...}
<L>__{interior voyager six site}
<A>__{as uhura continues:}
<C>__{uhura's intercom voice}
<D>__{... kept secret to keep voyager's data from rival subdivisions. mccoy that's preposterous! they wouldn't have kept scientific data from one another.}
<C>__{chekov's intercom voice}
<D>__{we are now checking with starfleet archives, captain. stand by.}
<A>__{angle on decker and "ilia" kirk, spock and mccoy are standing some distance from them (out of hearing). the probe is clearly moving into still closer touch with lt. ilia's memory patterns as decker takes her hand.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{and when v'ger melds? what will happen to you? "ilia" it will... take me from you ...}
<A>__{kirk, spock and mccoy mccoy is looking at kirk with an incredulous expression on his face.}
<D>__{mccoy and when it realizes what the creator is...?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{there's no way to know. v'ger expected it to be a machine some single entity.}
<P>__{(indicates entire site)}
<D>__{all of us here may be reduced into patterns...}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{that seems to be what it has planned to have the creator physically present here. mccoy}
<P>__{(small smile)}
<D>__{the god it captures is going to be a hell of a disappointment.}
<A>__{decker and "ilia" at the side of voyager six, decker in the midst of twisting a wing nut which releases a hatch which swings open. decker peers inside while "ilia" waits. kirk, spock and mccoy decker and "ilia" at the old capsule in b.g. as kirk looks that way.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{commander...}
<A>__{we see decker look up at kirk's call, then ignore him and go back to inspecting inside the access hatch. at this moment, from kirk's communicator, a signal.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(continuing; into communicator)}
<D>__{kirk here.}
<C>__{uhura's intercom voice}
<D>__{we now have the response code, sir.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{stand by. transmit it on my orders.}
<A>__{the three of them exchange looks kirk, spock and mccoy exchanging a silent moment of friendship and resignation. then kirk lifts his communicator again:}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{enterprise... transmit .}
<A>__{decker and "ilia" catching decker in the midst of pressing a control on his tricorder. both he and "ilia" are watching kirk and the others closely. now decker looks down at the tricorder's face. he nods:}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{recording...}
<A>__{kirk, spock and mccoy still waiting. they continue to wait. mccoy shifts uncomfortably, throws kirk a puzzled glance. kirk finally lifts his communicator.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{enterprise, are you transmitting?}
<C>__{uhura's intercom voice}
<D>__{affirmative, captain. for some time now.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{confirm code and transmitting frequency.}
<C>__{chekov's intercom voice}
<D>__{both signal and frequency confirmed, sir.}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{captain kirk!}
<B>__{various angles}
<A>__{as the others turn to decker and "ilia."}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.}
<P>__{(indicating into hatch)}
<D>__{the antenna leads have been disconnected. v'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{capture god! in order to retrieve v'ger's data, the creator has to physically come here!...}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{and plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...}
<P>__{(indicates into access)}
<D>__{... point here, captain. it should pick up even a tricorder playback.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(lifting communicator)}
<D>__{enterprise, i want that signal again. transmit!}
<A>__{then kirk touches a control on his tricorder exactly as decker did earlier. then he looks up, reacts as he sees decker holding his own tricorder up and a smile playing on decker's face.}
<B>__{action angle}
<A>__{as kirk suddenly pivots, races toward decker but he passes too close to the "ilia" probe. it sends him spinning back, tumbling to his knees.}
<B>__{at kirk}
<A>__{as kirk starts up to scramble to his feet but spock has stepped in, putting a hand on kirk's shoulder and re straining him.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{jim... he wants it.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{you got the enterprise, it's what you wanted. this is what i want.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{but, jim...}
<P>__{(now very seriously)}
<D>__{... i'm the right choice for this mission.}
<A>__{and then decker shoves the tricorder into the access hatch. various effects shots decker being fused v'ger transcending (s) for just an instant nothing happens and then a blinding shaft of light strikes decker. the color becomes brighter and brighter, begins spiraling through the room. "ilia" stes toward decker, is caught in the light, and instantly vanishes in a brilliant white glow. we see decker seeming to grow larger as if his molecular pattern is expanding. a spectacular series of visuals., the spiraling light enveloping the entire area. all this emanating from decker's body, becoming larger also brighter and brighter until now it is almost transparent . and the spiraling now expanding in all directions, and the room itself starting to dissolve , vanishing into nothingness and all commencing to slip into the new dimension. kirk, spock and mccoy stand transfixed another instant. around them, v'ger seems to be transforming into bril liant, lovely patterns. they all turn and race into the complex in the direction of their vessel.}
