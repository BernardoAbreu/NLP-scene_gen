<A>__{as he steps out of ackerman's office, sits down. now, all of the fear, all of the anxiety that he has been fighting down comes welling up. what if he pushed too hard? what will he do if he doesn't get a job? if ted kramer could fall to his knees and pray, he would. cross cut with the christmas party: that swirls around him. we notice in particular, one very pretty young woman flirting with a number of men. she is wearing a dress with straps, one of them has broken and she has patched it with a piece of masking tape. finally the door to ackerman's office opens and he steps out.}
