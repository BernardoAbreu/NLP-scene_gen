<A>__{david enters camera follows as david finds his way through bean's washing hanging from strings across the room. bean is sticking things in a picture album.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hi, am i disturbing you?}
<A>__{bean gives him an affable smile. in a pause before he quite gathers himself to broach the difficult subject, david asks a polite question.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{bean acquiesces. he starts from the beginning, with pictures of him as a kid. always standing on his own. picture of bean with mop of frizzy hair, at 16. david smiles. bean mimes stupid disco dancing. david turns another page. it is a sequence of pictures of bean at famous uk locations big ben, stonehenge, buckingham palace, 10 downing street. they are .idiosyncratic because all taken by him at arms length with his polaroid so he never quite makes it squarely into shot. a whole page of teddy. then three pages of bean's mini with dates, on labels, going way back. then a whole page of garden gnomes.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{none of your folks here family?}
<A>__{bean starts to look for something in particular. david uses the pause to broach the awful subject.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{look... the reason i came in here was to ... well... since you've been here twelve all...}
<A>__{bean has found what he was looking for. it is the picture of the family that he took from the landing on his first night here. what's left of the polaroid of himself, from the mall, that he rescued from brutus, is stuck next to it. he's even written 'bean & family' he doesn't realise there's anything sad about it. but david is rather moved. pause.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well, that's er...great. look, i just came in ... (no, he cant do it) ... to say good night. okay?}
<A>__{bean nods. david smiles and goes to the door. be an waves good bye a little rudely and gets back to the album. even when we feel sorry for him, he's a little rude. david walks away, shaking his head.}
