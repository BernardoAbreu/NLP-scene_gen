<D>__{on the surface, heather duke was the vivacious young lady we all knew her to be. but her soul was in antartica, freezing with the knowledge of the way fellow teenagers can be cruel, the way parents can be unresponsive, and as she writes so eloquently in her suicide note, the way life can suck. we'll all miss sherwood's little eskimo. let's hope she's rubbing noses with jesus.}
