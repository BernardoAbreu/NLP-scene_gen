<L>__{interior room 2510 day 1:25pm}
<A>__{other lights have been turned on. eleanor grant is fixing her hair in the mirror. franco is cleaning up the broken lamp. there is a perfunctory knock on the hall door and it opens, revealing brendan grant. the mystery man hovers in the background.}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<D>__{hey, el, how's the head?}
<A>__{she turns, locks eyes with the mystery man.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{eleanor.}
<A>__{she nods, turns back to the mirror.}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<D>__{lousy. and i have siesta hair. i'm thinking of canceling the speech.}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<D>__{it's an important speech.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{i'd say critical, not that it's any of my business.}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<D>__{it's just another speech in a tower of babel so high that nimrod himself would be put to shame. cancel. make my apologies.}
<A>__{in the mirror she takes note of brendan grant and the mystery man exchange a look.}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{i will trot along. nice to see you, eleanor.}
<A>__{brendan steps into the room, shuts the door.}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<D>__{during a campaign every speech is important. this is free media exposure. primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<D>__{what's he doing here?}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<D>__{who, him? just visiting.}
<C>__{eleanor grant t}
<D>__{hings have changed, brendan. i thought you understood that.}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<D>__{he's my friend. and he did help you to get elected, after all.}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<D>__{don't remind me.}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<P>__{(re the broken lamp)}
<D>__{what happened here?}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<D>__{nothing. i broke a lamp.}
<A>__{brendan steps behind eleanor and puts his arms around her affectionately.}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<D>__{eleanor, please. i will put it this way. this speech or a half dozen rubber chicken fund raisers. what do you say?}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<D>__{truth is, besides the headache i've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. make my apologies.}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<D>__{come on, el, you're a trooper. i will get you some pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to sacramento. this is no time to lay down on the job. i don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. look what happened to bush. tell you what, if you want to blow off the sacramento speech, fine. but do this one and we'll get out of the smog.}
<A>__{eleanor grant looks at him, almost sadly. she steps toward the dressing table to fix her hair}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<D>__{all right, i will do it.}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<D>__{that's my girl.}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<D>__{but i want to make some changes. get krista in here right away won't you?}
<A>__{brendan looks at her for a beat, then snaps his fingers like he just remembered something.}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<D>__{aw, gee. i sent her on an errand.}
<C>__{eleanor grant}
<D>__{you sent my assistant on an errand.}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<P>__{(trying to look sheepish)}
<D>__{i've been a bad boy.}
<B>__{angle on eleanor}
<A>__{it was not what she wanted to hear.}
