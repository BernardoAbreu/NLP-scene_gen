<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i've seen one of these before. a friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. away to fuck the irs. is that what you're doing, or are you the real mccoy?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{real mccoy.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you're a preacher?}

<D>__{was? as in not anymore?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{why'd ya quit?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i think i've gotten about as up close and personal with you as i'm gonna get. now if you need me like i think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause i won't answer your stupid, prying questions. so, with all due respect, mind your own business.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i seem to have touched a nerve. don't be so sensitive, pops, let's keep this friendly. but you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit. now, there's two ways we can play this hand. one way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. the other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, i will win. but we go down the second, we'll both win. now, i don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. y'all can live forever or die this second and i don't care which. the only things i do care about are me that son of a bitch in the back, and our money. and right now i need to get those three things into mexico. now, stop me if i'm wrong, but i take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. am i correct?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i thought so. you help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. that way everybody gets what they want. you and your kids get out of this alive and we get into mexico. everybody's happy.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{how do i know you'll keep your word?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{jesus christ, pops, don't start with this shit.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you want me to sit here and be passive. the only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if i believe you'll let us go. i'm not there yet. you have to convince me you're telling the truth.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. i don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. and i don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. you notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{didn't like it, did ya?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no, i didn't.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{didn't think so. so, as i was saying, i'm willing to make a deal. you behave, get us into mexico, and don't try to escape. i will keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you won't let him touch her?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i can handle richie, don't worry.}
<A>__{the two men look at each other for some measure of trust. seth sticks out his hand.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i give you my word.}
<A>__{seth can't help but think about the last time he gave his word.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(hand sticks out)}
<D>__{my words, my law. better you not take it, and that's just where we are, then take it and not mean it.}
<A>__{jacob takes his hand, but looks right into seth.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{if he touches her, i will kill him. i don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{fair enough. you break your word, i will kill all of you.}
<P>__{(calling to the back)}
