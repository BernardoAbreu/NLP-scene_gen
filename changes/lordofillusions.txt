<ACTION>__{A violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just make out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William Nix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI. The "family" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON SCREEN, the words:  '"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago"}
<LOC>__{EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{We're at the front door now, which stands open.  Leaning against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about sixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding, almost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black, the other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield narrows his eyes. BUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V. The Volkswagen "bus" and Thunderbird are approaching the house.}

<LOC>__{INT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic cult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse a little of what life here is like. The rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING helpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and oppressive. The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his way to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the floor, light these claustrophobic corridors.}

A terrifying yet charismatic presence. All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives - wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. They watch Nix in adoration.
