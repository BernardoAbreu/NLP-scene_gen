<A>__{blomkvist, plunging a french press, watches as the girlfriend lets herself out. in the bedroom, salander finishes getting dressed, sticks her taser in the back pocket of her jeans and comes out to find a table setting that's more formal than she, or anyone who lives alone, is used to.}

<D>__{you're awake. good. breakfast is ready.}
<A>__{he pours her, and then himself, coffee.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i guess i alarmed you showing up like this.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{if you touch me, i will more than alarm you.}

<P>__{(they study each other)}
<D>__{i'm not going to do anything about that. i could but i won't. what i'm going to do is tell you a story. if it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research it further. if it doesn't, i will wash the dishes and leave ... are you going to even touch your food?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{what kind of research?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
