<L>__{exterior canal night}
<A>__{tight on white's face his eyes are shut tight. he opens them, slowly looks around, curious why he isn't dead.}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{white floats in mid air, hovering ten feet or so above a dark body of water. he looks amazed. shuts his eyes, rubs them, opens them again. still floating. he clenches his fists and tenses his body. slowly he starts to move forward, hovering at an even height over the water.}
<B>__{wider still}
<A>__{several angles feature the figure of white levitating across the harbour, past half sunken buildings and rusted ships. tight on white he comes to a stop. smiles in amazement. then he suddenly plummets into the water, like a trap door has opened beneath him. angle on bubbles floating to the surface. white's face rises slowly out of the water. wider city skyline a small object floats towards the ground at the end of a tiny white parachute.}
<B>__{back on white}
<A>__{he swims across to a small boat, climbs aboard, pushes himself silently through the still canals of the city.}
