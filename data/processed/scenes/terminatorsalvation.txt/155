<L>__{interior submarine hatch area day}
<A>__{near the engine room, a couple dozen rescued prisoners are being treated by unarmed medical personnel, others huddle under blankets with food and drink. kate is among those helping the former prisoners. kyle and star eat ravenously, he finishes one mre and grabs up another. a few feet away, marcus leans against a wall, plasma rifle at his side. a doctor examines him warily, prodding his injured face.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{does this hurt?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i don't feel a thing. help somebody else.}
<A>__{the doctor moves on as a couple of haz mat suited figures come down the ladder from the hatch, face masks removed. among them is connor. kate moves to his side as more dazed humans come down. she speaks quietly, eying kyle nearby.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{your dad he seems like a nice kid.}
<A>__{connor can't deal with that at the moment, speaks loudly.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{the last boatload is right behind me. skynet's pouring in reinforcements, we can't hold this place. and the people in the houses, they won't leave }
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{they're not people anymore...}
<A>__{he trails off, reacting to the sight of a familiar figure descending the ladder, in a long coat, head down. she looks up to make eye contact... serena.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{slo mo: seeing marcus, serena reaches into her coat marcus moves at the same time, to grab his plasma rifle serena leaps off the ladder, aiming a small, powerful plasma}
<B>__{weapon.}
<A>__{serena fires first blam! the plasma blast catches marcus in the shoulder and blows his gun arm clean off. his plasma rifle discharges, blowing a hole in the side of the sub, near the floor water gushes in like a firehose. leave slo mo. spun around by the force of the blast, marcus lands on his back, sparks and severed cables protruding from his damaged shoulder. an alarm klaxon sounds. prisoners and doctors scream and scramble for cover connor steps in front of kate to shield her, they back away through the water blast, connor firing at serena serena takes numerous hits from the explosive bullets, which take off pieces of her, but she keeps coming, fires again hitting connor in the lower abdomen. he's thrown backward, kate cries out and throws herself on top of him. his gun has gone flying. serena turns her attention to marcus, standing over him, plasma weapon aimed point blank at his head.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{why, marcus? you were immortal...}
<A>__{marcus manages a smile as he shakes his head.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{no one lives forever.}
<A>__{blam! multiple plasma blasts from behind riddle serena's torso, the blue pulses burning right through her her head takes a hit, the steel is ruptured. the plasma weapon flies out of her arms, she collapses. tight on her face, as she turns to see who got her there's no one there. but on the floor lies marcus' severed arm, still holding his plasma rifle. the hand releases the weapon. serena's head tilts, her eyes go blank she's dead. medical personnel are doing what they can to help connor, blood at his lips, kate and kyle at his side.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{this... this can't happen...}
