<L>__{interior captain's office day}
<B>__{close shot desk}
<A>__{featuring placard reading lieutenant ross. we hear ross' first few words over this, then camera pulls back to medium shot. ross is forceful, clean cut, gives the impression of toughness but fairness. as he talks he takes down the photographs of prize fighters and prize fighting from the wall. watching and listening are sergeants dhom, thornhill, henderson, leva, stark and karelsen and corporal wilson. ross is such a complete switch from holmes that the men are almost unnerved by him. but a definite respect is reflected in their expressions. warden, beside his desk, shares this.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{ i don't intend to have a sloppy outfit. i don't intend to have a goldbrick outfit. i don't intend to have a soft soap outfit. i've called you noncoms in because you're the backbone of any company.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{from now on you'll have to prove you're entitled to have those stripes here. and not in the boxing ring.}
<A>__{he bands the pictures to leva.}
<C>__{ross}

<C>__{leva}

<C>__{ross}
<D>__{that's all i have to say. if you've any questions, speak up.}
<A>__{nobody speaks.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{dismissed.}
<A>__{the men troop out, passing camera. as last man leaves, camera is on warden. he is looking at ross with considerable approval, even admiration. he resumes a more normal expression as ross turns toward him.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{one non com was missing, sir. sergeant galovitch.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{i know. private galovitch is in the kitchen.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{in the kitchen?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{as of now, he's an assistant cook. i busted him. on a blanket charge of inefficiency. what are you grinning at?}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{i think the company commander made a wise decision, sir.}

<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{compny g, first sergeant warden speaking.}
<A>__{karen's voice is heard on the phone; we cannot understand what she is saying, but a flood of words pours through. with ross looking on, warden is embarrassed.}

<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{lissen, i will get away somehow, tonight. i will meet you in kuhio park. at eight... right....}
<A>__{he puts down the receiver. he stares at the desk. then he slowly pulls out the top drawer. the officers application blank is lying on top of a pile of other papers. he takes it out, looks at it somberly. camera moves in to an insert of the application. we see warden's answers to sex, age, race, etc. camera moves down the page to the place for the signature of the applicant. it is unsigned.}
