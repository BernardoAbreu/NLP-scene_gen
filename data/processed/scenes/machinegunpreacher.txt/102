<L>__{interior chapel shekinah fellowship church day}
<A>__{sam entering at the back of the chapel, taking a moment to appreciate what he's looking at: 20 or 30 people here in the church that he built. a dream realized. and he walks down the center aisle, shaking hands with a few people, climbing steps to the altar and switching on the microphone...}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to the band)}
<D>__{thank you, tommy. you boys is soundin pretty good up here.}
<A>__{sam turning to the crowd, clearing his throat, clearly nervous.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i wanna thank ya'll for comin out for the first day of worship here at shekinah fellowship church.}
<A>__{some applause. lynn and paige sitting with daisy who is beaming.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{the guest preacher we had booked today ain't shown up... so i thought i'd say a word or two.}
<A>__{an awkward beat...}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{lotta yous been wonderin what made me wanna build this here church. seein as i ain't the best seed in the bunch i can understand that.}
<A>__{a beat, considering what to say... and he begins...}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{buncha years ago i was runnin from some bad fellas in the woods over there by cleary. those old boys was comin after me hard and i reached in my bag lookin for my old shotgun but it was gone. my momma had took it out when i wasn't lookin and put this bible in there instead...}
<A>__{sam holding up a worn bible, and we start to notice something here... a transformation happening in this man as he speaks to these people. his nervousness falling away and a natural charisma taking over...}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{well i figured i was done for, so i sat down under an old tree with this useless book and i waited...}
<A>__{and we see the congregation hanging on his every word, identifying with this man standing before them. one of their own.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{... and then the strangest thing happened. them boys ran right on past me. didn't even see me sittin there. now the way i figure it, things would have turned out pretty different if i had pulled out that shotgun instead of this here bible. and that's probably the first time i can remember god savin my butt.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{god... and my momma.}
<A>__{some laughter and applause...}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{figure least i could do was build em both this church.}
<A>__{and the congregation responds with a hallelujah!}
