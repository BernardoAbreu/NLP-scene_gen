<L>__{interior the lobby of martin's office building day}
<A>__{martin gets off the elevator and heads across the lobby. garson and a uniformed officer approach him. martin looks a little unnerved to see them.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{ah, mr. tannen, we were just coming up to see you. have you got a minute?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{detective, i told you no more questions without my lawyer.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{i think you'd better call him.}
<L>__{interior an interrogation room later.}
<A>__{martin sits at a table, conferring with his lawyer, ned volant, an impeccably dressed operator with a mane of thick, heavily gelled hair. garson sits across from them.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{there's a small discrepancy that i can't quite figure out and i was hoping you might be able to explain it.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i suppose i can try.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{the final toxicology report came back and your wife definitely didn't die from the pills. she wasn't conscious past 9:30, but it was the fumes that killed her.}
<C>__{m}
<C>__{artin}
<D>__{well, hallelujah, thanks for the update }
<C>__{volant}
<D>__{martin, easy.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but this is harassment.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{see, here's what i needed to ask you. the gas tank in the jag was almost full, just a gallon had been used.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{well, if she was unconscious by 9:30, that means the car must have been running for at least two hours when you found her. an unconscious person can't turn on a car, right?}
<C>__{volant}
<D>__{detective, with all due respect, could you get to the point?}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{well, here's where i get confused, see, that particular model idling for two hours will burn at least four gallons of gas.}
<A>__{martin tries to remain calm, as the panic starts to settle in for a long stay.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{so, there's really no way the tank could be almost full if it was running for two hours. is there?}
<A>__{he looks at martin, waiting for an answer.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{so, i guess what i'm asking is, whose idea was it to put her in the car?}
<C>__{volant}
<D>__{martin, don't say anything.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{now, mr. tannen, you clearly had the most to gain from her death, but i've learned from a number of your wife's friends that she and mini had a strained relationship.}
<C>__{volant}
<D>__{again, detective, my client won't be answering anything, so let's just cut the cat and mouse.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{i'd like mr. tannen to know that if he's trying to be a protective father by covering up something mini did, i'd be careful. the district attorney is viewing this case as an opportunity to show the public that the rich don't get away with murder in this town.}
<A>__{martin whispers something in volant's ear and he in turn,}
<C>__{v}
<A>__{whispers back.}
<C>__{olant}
<D>__{does this mean he's offering mr. tannen immunity if he says he was protecting his daughter?}
<A>__{garson takes a sip of water, as martin anxiously waits for his answer.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{it's a strong possibility. but he wants mr. tannen to know he will go for the maximum sentence if he doesn't. no manslaughter, no plea bargains, nothing.}
<A>__{martin's eyes shift slightly.}
