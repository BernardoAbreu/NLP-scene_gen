<T>__{fade in:}
<B>__{main credits roll}
<A>__{over black screen, with portentous spooky music underneath. just as the music reaches its crescendo, we hear a simian screech. a buck toothed cartoon monkey swings past on a vine. title wipes in with him:}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{in "freud chicken!"}
<A>__{tight closeup stanley (animated) a pocketwatch swings back and forth in f.g. gaping at it is a goofy, bespectacled cartoon character, sucking his thumb as his eyes move back and forth. after a moment, the left eye freezes in place but the right eye keeps going back and forth with the watch.}
<C>__{shrink's voice }
<D>__{back, stanley...you're going back...back to when it all began. are you going back yet? come on, get back, ve haven't got all day.}
<A>__{now both eyes are locked in place. the patient is hypnotized.}
<L>__{interior schoolroom day (animated)}
<A>__{a squat, lumpy teacher, miss hudlapp, is straining to erase the gettysburg address, which is written along the very top of the blackboard. there's an obtrusive, rhythmic banging noice in b.g.}
<C>__{stanley }
<D>__{it was third grade. the teacher was miss hudlapp. she was kinda squat and lumpy she smelled funny but she was kind.}
<C>__{miss hudlapp}
<D>__{class!}
<P>__{(turning around suddenly)}
<D>__{how many times have i told you? in this class we do not pound tenpenny nails into stanley's head!}
<A>__{reverse angle on stanley hapless ten year old stanley, still goofy and bespectacled, in his front row desk. nails stick out of his head. the four mean kids poised around him lower their hammers and return to their seats, grumbling. a dreamy smile crosses stanley's face as he gazes at miss hudlapp.}
<C>__{stanley }
<D>__{you know how some teachers have those, kind of, flaps on their arms those big sacks of limp flab that like, dangle?}
<A>__{as miss hudlapp pulls her sweater off, two massive arm flaps fifty gallons of flab apiece spill out and smack into the floor. miss huddlapp claps two erasers together, kicking up a cloud of dust. young stanley watches, transfixed by her massive arm flaps. we track in on the gigantic arm flaps as they swing hypnotically back and forth, with a loud slap each time they collide.}
<C>__{stanley }
<D>__{it sounds weird...but for some reason, as i watched those big old flaps of hers, i began to feel...well...oddly...}
<A>__{now we track in on the mesmerized stanley. a song comes up underneath: donna summer, "i feel love."}
<C>__{stanley }
<D>__{...aroused.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and then the horror began.}
<A>__{doink! stanley looks down at his lap in horror. the boys and girls around him are pointing and tittering. grimacing in embarrassment, he discreetly places a heavy textbook onto his lap, suppressing the bulge in his pants. but sproing!! the book goes flying across the room. the bulge is fighting back! the kids duck and cover beneath their desks as stanley slams a stack of textbooks onto his lap. it's no use the whole stack goes flying, and books come raining down on the entire class! now miss hudlapp is staring directly at him...}
<C>__{miss hudlapp}
<D>__{young man. what's that in your lap?}
<A>__{she marches toward him. stanley pulls his backpack over his lap.}
<C>__{stanley }
<D>__{it was useless. like putting a baseball cap on the washington monument. and then...all at once ...there he was.}
<A>__{the backpack bucks and wriggles, as if something inside is trying to get out. and then with a flourish of rousing disco strings it does!}
<C>__{stanley }
<D>__{monkeybone!!}
<A>__{the libidinous cartoon monkey bursts out of the backpack, points at miss hudlapp and announces, in his barry white baritone:}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{oooo oo ooh, baby. i love your way.}
<A>__{kc and the sunshine band comes up underneath as monkeybone dances to the front of the class. he grabs miss hudlapp by the hands and begins dancing the bump with her arm flaps. butt left, whap. butt right, whap. the kids are bug eyed agog. with each whap their little heads turn back and forth as if they're watching a nude tennis match.}
<L>__{interior screening room on audience (live action)}
<A>__{a roomful of live humans watching the cartoon, heads turning in sync with the kids onscreen. tv industry hipsters, ad execs, manufacturer's reps...they're all guests at this sneak preview of the monkeybone show, and they're laughing uproariously. in the midst of the crowd is a handsome young couple: julie mcelroy and stu miley. julie's a research scientist, brainy, professional, abnormally well adjusted and pretty enough that she'd be intimidating if it weren't for a prominent goofy streak. stu is the one guy in the auditorium who isn't laughing at the cartoon on the screen. in fact, he's solemn as a judge peering nervously around to see how the rest of the audience is responding. why? because he's the cartoonist who created the characters on screen. in his looks (gangly, disheveled) and manner (sardonic, self deprecating), he's the obvious model for the character of stanley.}
<L>__{interior classroom (animated)}
<A>__{as the monkey dance continues, we zoom in on the mortified face of little stanley. his eyes begin doing the familiar hypno swirl...}
<L>__{interior shrink's office (animated)}
<A>__{a cuckoo pops out of a wall clock. adult stanley's thumb pops out of his mouth. he awakens from his trance in a cold sweat.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{how about it, doc? can you help me?}
<C>__{shrink}
<D>__{not overnight. these imaginary monkey cases take time. i vould estimate...roughly...}
<A>__{on the desk is a catalogue, open to a two page spread depicting a 40 foot cabin cruiser. "new for summer! only $229,999.95!" with his free hand, the shrink is working a calculator...}
<C>__{shrink}
<D>__{twelve years and three months ought to do it.}
<A>__{the shrink hustles stanley to the door and shakes his hand.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{one question, doc what did you mean when you said "imaginary"?}
<C>__{shrink}
<D>__{all in good time, my boy. all in good time.}
<A>__{the shrink shoves stanley out and slams the door behind him. two beats. then he doubles over, weeping with laughter.}
<C>__{shrink}
<D>__{vot a crackpot! monkey on ze back hah!! roll out ze wacky wagon!!}
<A>__{now he notices a backpack, which stanley has left on the couch. it twitches slightly of its own free will.}
<C>__{voice in backpack}
<D>__{imaginary, huh? you quack.}
<L>__{exterior shrink's building (animated)}
<A>__{a window shatters. the shrink comes hurtling out. monkeybone straddles him like slim pickens riding an h bomb, hootin' and hollerin' all the way down to the street. splat! a gob of gore hits stanley in the face as he exits the building. he kneels on the sidewalk finding a pipe and a goatee.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{aw, monkeybone! at this rate i will never find a good shrink.}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{those guys are a waste of money! i will show you how to stop sucking your thumb...}
<A>__{monkeybone sticks his thumb in his butt as he and stanley toddle off into the sunset.}
<L>__{interior screening room that moment}
<A>__{standing o from the crowd as the cartoon ends and the lights come up. herb, an all purpose sidekick type, appears at the podium:}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{thank you...that's our pilot...the good news is, comedy channel has just picked us up with an order for six new episodes!}
<A>__{herb leads a round of applause. julie nudges stu the only guy in the room who's still in his seat.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{now, let's give it up for the guy who started it all. creator of america's most disturbed comic strip...the man behind the monkey...mister stu miley!}
<A>__{a spotlight hits him, and he stands to tumultuous applause. he looks genuinely stunned. he can't believe it's happening. julie surreptitiously pinches him on the bottom, giving him a start. she winks at him. he shoots her a small private smile then turns to wave at the adoring crowd.}
<L>__{interior lobby half hour later night}
<A>__{stu working his way through a crowd of well wishers and fans.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i don't actually draw all the animation, no. we have sweatshop workers who couldn't get jobs at nike doing that.}
<A>__{a beautiful, heavily pierced female fan hands stu a marker.}
<C>__{beautiful fan}
<D>__{mr. miley, would you draw monkeybone on my belly? as a guide?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{guide...?}
<C>__{beautiful fan}
<D>__{for my tattoo artist?}
<A>__{she exposes her taut midriff. stu thinks for a moment, then goes to work. when he's done, monkeybone appears to be climbing out of the girl's pants and waving to her. nearby fans applaud.}
<C>__{beautiful fan}
<D>__{wait! you have to draw the rest of him }
<A>__{she begins unbuckling her belt so stu will have enough room to draw monkeybone's bottom half. stu demurs...}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i i have to, uh, check in with my doctor. do occcc!!}
<A>__{he wanders across the room, finds julie deep in conversation with a bunch of other guests, and pulls her aside.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{hey, doc. come here. there's something really cool i want to show you.}
<A>__{he grabs her by the sleeve, pulls her across the floor to }
<L>__{interior alcove off lobby continuous}
<A>__{there's nothing "cool" about it it's a stairway landing, with metal fire doors that open onto the parking lot outside.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{see these doors? the cool thing is, you go out ...they close...you can't get back in!}
<A>__{he opens one door and holds it for julie.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{you want to leave? but stu you're a big hit! everyone loves you!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{they don't love me. they love monkeybone.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{it was you who got the standing o. it was you drawing on the belly over there...}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{that was especially monkeybone. come on, doc, i don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. i just want to be us. home. alone!}
<P>__{(conspiratorially)}
<D>__{i have something i have to give you.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{can't you give it to me later?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{yeah, i could, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.}
<A>__{he gives up trying to explain...pulls her close and kisses her. for a moment they completely forget about the party in the next room. then herb appears behind them, trying to catch stu's eye as he waits for the clinch to break up. finally he pries them apart:}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{sorry, julie won't be a minute. now stu i know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys }
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{julie and i we were just gonna go...}
<A>__{but before stu knows what's hit him, herb is leading him back to }
<L>__{interior lobby that moment continuous}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{go? there's a potload of money here, pal. you got three major toy companies...you got the guys from burger god over here...}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{burger god. the ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{never proven. they're ready to pop for a pre emptive endorsement. kids love burger god }
<A>__{the merchandisers shoot stu an expectant wave. stu waves back and turns in the opposite direction. herb grabs him by the sleeve.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{herb, it's too much. it's all out of hand.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? you gotta strike. i'm talking mansions. lamborghinis. champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i don't want to be rich. it's just a trap!}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{being rich is not a trap. that is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{herb. i have to go.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i got the ring.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tonight's the night, herb. tonight's the night.}
<A>__{he nods toward julie, who's at the open bar grabbing two glasses of punch. herb realizes a proposal is in the works.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{oh my god...you're proposing?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{my life was totally crappy, herb, and she... fixed it. she made me happy. which i'd never been. she loves me the way i am right now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't want everything to change. i don't want her saying yes to some big success. i just want her saying yes to me.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{...in some weird way i respect that.}
<A>__{julie's over by the punchbowl. she sees the two boys staring at her conspiratorially makes a face at them as she waves back.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{okay then. if i get you out of here you pop the question tonight. or else. get me?}
<A>__{stu nods gravely.}
<L>__{exterior parking lot night}
<A>__{stu, julie, and herb in the parking lot. a small safari of flunkies is loading enormous boxes full of monkeybone junk into stu's beat up car stuffed dolls, action figures, board games, lunchboxes, beach towels, team jackets and more! stu groans at the sight of it...}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{they're just prototypes...take 'em home and look at 'em before you say no...}
<P>__{(scanning the streets)}
<D>__{if you could just hold on a minute or two, we're expecting a couple more trucks.}
<A>__{stu glowers at herb as he opens the car door for julie.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{okay, okay! you're a beautiful couple. go.}
<L>__{interior car night moving}
<A>__{stu backs out of his space. the small parking lot is full of delivery trucks from would be merchandisers all too large for the spaces they're parked in. stu has to keep backing up because the exit lanes are blocked. it's like negotiating a labyrinth.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{look at this! he won't let us leave!}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{the monkey!! he's everywhere! he'll take over both our lives if we let him.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{stu stop it. that monkey is good luck. you thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. so relax! enjoy it!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i'm trying. it's weird, that's all. i never had any good luck, until i met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{what's the "bad" part?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i might wake up.}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(laughing; taking his hand)}
<D>__{if you do, i will be right there beside you. so face it. you're just going to have to be happy!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i am happy. it just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.}
<A>__{he says it so solemnly that she cracks up. after a moment he joins in.}
<L>__{exterior parking lot that moment night}
<A>__{a plastic banner stretches between two poles on either side of the entry to the lot. it shows monkeybone in a typical languorous pose: it's his world. we just live in it!}
<B>__{monkeybone}
<A>__{sunday nights this fall two guys on extension ladders are taking the sign down as stu's car idles at the exit below. there's a strong wind tonight, and one guy loses hold of his end of the banner just as he gets it detached...}
<L>__{interior car that moment night}
<A>__{as stu pulls into the intersection he sees a delivery truck approaching in the opposite lane, with a cardboard likeness of monkeybone mounted atop the cab. he chuckles...}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{that damn monkey is everywh }
<A>__{suddenly his view of the street disappears. the monkeybone banner has fallen directly across his windshield, like a huge shroud. all he can see is a great, grinning monkey face!! julie screams. stu screams. unable to see, he slams on the brakes and}
<B>__{jerks the wheel right.}
<A>__{off screen: horns blaring. tires squealing. the horrible crunch of metal}
<B>__{on metal.}
<A>__{but stu's car comes to a halt untouched. after a moment he opens his eyes...and julie opens hers...}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{did we just hit something?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{are you okay??}
<A>__{she thinks it over, nods. stu takes a moment to catch his breath, then opens the door gingerly. a horn blares as a car speeds past in the opposite lane, nearly taking stu's door off. he jumps back inside, waits, opens the door again...}
<L>__{exterior intersection that moment}
<A>__{his eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene. the asphalt is strewn with monkeybone merchandise stuffed dolls, games, lunchboxes. skid marks show where the truck which was carrying all this}
<B>__{swerved...}
<A>__{...and slammed into the rear of a buick regal, pinning it up against a telephone pole. stu races up to the buick. its front end is mashed up like an accordion, but the occupants a couple of teenagers dressed for the prom seem to be okay.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{hey! are you guys all right in there?}
<C>__{teenage girl}
<D>__{we're fine.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{that stupid monkey banner! it fell on my windshield it practically killed us all!}
<P>__{(to julie)}
<D>__{god, julie, if anything had happened to you }
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i'm fine, baby. we're all okay. we were lucky.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i'd better go report this...}
<A>__{he spots a phone booth and starts across the street. on the way there he plucks a stuffed monkeybone doll off the pavement and chokes it with both hands. julie stays behind with the prom kids. the teenage boy in his tux is glassy eyed, miserable beyond description.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{dad's car?}
<A>__{the boy begins to sob softly. julie nods in sympathy. then: everyone winces. the air is full of a horrible creaking noise, like nails on a blackboard...}
<C>__{teenage girl}
<D>__{what was that? did you hear that?}
<A>__{the horrible creaking noise continues. julie turns. behind her, the telephone pole that the car slammed into is beginning to teeter. then it topples. directly toward...}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{stu!!}
<A>__{on stu in phone booth he sees julie running toward him and holds up a single finger.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{operator? i want to report an accident.}
<A>__{finally he glances up just in time to see the telephone pole coming down toward the phone booth like a gigantic sledgehammer. his eyes widen. the stuffed monkeybone slips from his grasp... closeup monkeybone a horrible crash. screams. camera zeroes in on the monkeybone doll which stu was holding, surrounded by broken glass, its face twisted into an insane, almost macabre grin. the screen fades to pitch black for a few seconds...until we hear a distant siren, and an image comes swimming into focus... stu's pov: on julie he's in the back of an ambulance, with paramedics all around him, working feverishly. julie hovers above him, holding his hand.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{stu? i'm here, baby. it's me. it's julie. i love you. you're gonna be okay, baby, i promise }
<A>__{all at once he seems to be receding from julie and the others as if sinking through the bottom of the stretcher, and beyond through the floor of the ambulance! julie's voice grows weaker, more distant:}
<C>__{julie }
<D>__{i'm here, baby. i won't leave you...}
<A>__{and then all trace of the ambulance is gone, and he's floating down through some strange limbo, surrounded by the silhouettes of billowing shrouds, with the sound of birds calling all around him... an awful mechanical ratcheting noise fills the soundtrack. stu's eyes close and when they reopen, he finds himself in:}
<L>__{exterior trolley moving}
<A>__{a tiny roller coaster car descends from dense clouds down the length of an impossibly long and rickety metal track. the track leads through a vast black void... ...to a tiny island floating in the darkness...an island that looks not unlike a disembodied fist. and, as the car draws closer, the fist begins to open tulip like turning into a hand, with a full sized town nestled in its palm! in the town, carnival lights begin to glitter. music begins to tinkle...}
<L>__{exterior platform night}
<A>__{the car a one passenger job with a cartoon animal face on its prow stops with a lurch. stu steps out onto a fog shrouded train station platform. before he knows it, the little car departs behind him. he's stranded alone.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{hello? anybody? am i dead?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{please. i'd like to know if i'm dead.}
<A>__{off in the fog is a big wheeled cart with the sign: "psychological baggage claim." there stu finds two suitcases and a backpack. he examines the tags. they all belong to him! he sits on the edge of the cart, opens a suitcase, and pulls out... a bagged copy of marvel comics' conan the barbarian #1; an 8mm reel of highlights from ray harryhausen's jason and the argonauts, with swordfighting skeletons on the box cover; a spiral notebook, its cover labelled "stu m. geography," its inside pages covered with drawings of dinosaurs and airplanes; transparent plastic models of "the visible man" and his mate, "the visible woman," with a couple of spare organs that young stu never quite found a place for; a vinyl lp of "bread's greatest hits," which stu quickly slips back into the suitcase lest anyone see it. as he gathers his bags, he hears odd squeaks and chittering...}
<C>__{raccoon }
<D>__{carry your bags, mister?}
<A>__{a strange furry creature pops out from beneath the platform and yanks on stu's pants leg. it looks like a raccoon, but it's flat an animated pelt. before stu has time to let out a yell, a flat snakeskin comes slithering out from beneath the baggage cart...}
<C>__{snake}
<D>__{cigars, mister? genuine coobans!}
<A>__{stu looks down and sees a squashed rabbit humping his leg.}
<C>__{rabbit}
<D>__{wanna meet my sister?}
<A>__{these bordertown types are known as roadkill, and they're sporting the tire tracks to prove it. stu screams, shakes them off, and runs.}
<L>__{exterior dark town gates night}
<A>__{a long stone stairway leads to decorative wrought iron gates. shadowy carved sphinxes sit on either side. as stu races up the steps, a sputtering neon sign comes to life overhead:}
<C>__{d rk town}
<A>__{a fanfare blows as the creaky gates begin to part. a spotlight hits the sphinxes and they come to life! they rise up on their hind legs, put on boater hats. one of them blows a note on a kazoo...}
<C>__{singing sphinxes}
<D>__{weeee...welcome you to dark town and while you're in your coma this odd amusement park town will be your home sweet homa }
<A>__{stu bolts through the gates, with the roadkill trio right on his heels. the indignant sphinxes exchange a look of outrage.}
<L>__{exterior dark town midway night}
<A>__{it's a carny town, a tourist trap, seedy and nightmarish. despite the festive trappings, there's something off about it an air of neglect and decrepitude as if they'd tried to turn alcatraz into disneyland, and given up halfway through. stu looks back and sees the roadkill gaining on him. he spots a small group of other humans...}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{help me. please. there's animals. they }
<A>__{the humans just yawn. they're coma victims, just like stu. he ditches one of his suitcases as the roadkill come after him.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{pony ride, mister?}
<A>__{he turns and spots a helpful looking fellow in a cowboy outfit. the cowboy is in fact a centaur rider and mount rolled into one! the characters who run this place the barkers, ticket takers, and ride operators are all weird hybrids, part human, part animal. they could be the ancient gods of some primitive culture reduced to working as street entertainers in this ramshackle resort town. stu pinballs down the street, bouncing from one shock to another: joe camel, doing community service as a street sweeper }
<C>__{joe camel}
<D>__{hey, mister. mister! got a smoke?}
<A>__{ a yeti selling sno cones from a cart outside the morpheum theatre. the marquee reads:}
<D>__{live! nightmares! live! first run continuous performances popular prices rated nr h not recommended for humans}
<A>__{ a cyclops working as a barker at the penny arcade; a video rental outlet "bad dreams video," offering your favorite nightmares, cult and classic, three nights for $2.95. a three headed devil emerges from the shop carrying a sackful of videos and recognizes stu, much to his horror.}
<D>__{head #1 hey, aren't you stu miley? head #2 we're big fans. head #3 could we have your autograph?}
<A>__{reduced to babbling hysteria, stu ducks into the nearest building. above the door, an animated neon sign shows a happy boozer lifting his martini glass, then falling over flat on his back, at which point his eyes are replaced by the traditional cartoon x's. this is the coma bar.}
<L>__{interior coma bar a moment later night}
<A>__{stu bursts in, flattens himself against the wall as the roadkill skitter past outside. he's given them the slip. he looks around. the bar's a weird melange of styles. coma victims ride around in wheelchairs refurbished as bumper cars, drinking cocktails from iv bottler. a four armed elephant god is at the mighty wurlitzer while a mermaid vocalist in a half shell belts out the wistful lyrics of johnny mercer's "dream." and over at the bar...}
<C>__{bull }
<D>__{new in town, huh? what're you drinking?}
<A>__{out of breath, stu edges toward the bar as the bartender, bull, turns away to grab a fresh glass.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{chasing me animals horrible }
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{animals? what kind of animals?}
<A>__{stu gags. bull is a full fledged minotaur, body of a man, head of a bull. his features are cubist weirdly squashed over to one side.}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{yeah, i know picasso. guernica, right? that's what everybody says although personally, i don't see the resemblance. what are you drinking?}

<C>__{bull}
<D>__{yeah, i've seen a few of your dreams. you're quite a celebrity down here.}
<A>__{stu gives him a cockeyed look. bull points to a monitor mounted over the bar, on which a panicked man in pajamas is trying to run barefoot through a great sticky sea of molasses.}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{i told you, it's the land of nightmares. same on every channel...all the stuff people dream, after they have the extra anchovies.}
<A>__{he changes channels with a remote. now we see a guy falling through midair, arms and legs flailing, falling, falling, falling...}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{jeez, it all looks like bad late night cable.}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{sad commentary, huh?}
<A>__{now a small muffled voice speaks from the area of stu's backpack:}
<C>__{disembodied voice }

<P>__{(turning angrily to stu)}

<D>__{nice face. lemme guess. you were in a bullfight ...with a mack truck!!}
