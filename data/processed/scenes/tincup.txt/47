<A>__{tin cup and romeo emerge, romeo carrying t.c.'s sticks.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{listen, swami, your job is to teach me patience and humility, not to advise me on my love life.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{no. my job is to get your head straight so you can qualify for the open, much less win it. to get your head straight you got to forget about the doctor lady.}
<A>__{they head up the street under a collonade toward tin cup's waiting caddy.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{not all my thinking occurs below the belt. i actually stand for a few things beside where my next romantic interlude is coming from.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{then you got no problem telling the doctor lady you can't teach her no more till after the open.}
<A>__{tin cup blinks silently a moment, feeling slightly cornered.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{that would make an issue of something that ain't an issue. besides, i'm focused.}
<A>__{romeo responds with a spanish curse.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i mean, this is my quest!}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{ahhh... your quest... chingaso...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{this is where i stand up for all the little guys everywhere who've had their fill of soulless robots like david simms }
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{he may be a soulless robot but he's a rich, happy soulless robot with a beautiful doctor lady girlfriend who's got you by the huevos }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{besides, how is getting into the u.s. open gonna change what she thinks about you?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{it'll prove to her that i'm not who she thinks i am.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{but you are who she thinks you are! look, i don't bet on a horse with a hard on.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{hard on?! hard on?! hard on?! here, touch me, feel }
<P>__{(as tin cup grabs himself)}
<D>__{i don't feel nothing! here!}
<C>__{romeo}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{hey, hey... shit... cool it...}
<A>__{suddenly a convertible passes simms and molly, laughing, carefree, enjoying each other. the couple in the car doesn't see tin cup grabbing his crotch making a fool of himself on the sidewalk but tin cup and romeo see them. the car disappears down the street. tin cup cools off, chilled, really and full of chagrin.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{okay, okay... maybe i got a semi.}
