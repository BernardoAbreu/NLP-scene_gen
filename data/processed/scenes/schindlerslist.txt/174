<A>__{light pouring in through the windows. white sheets over the furniture like shrouds over the dead. schindler's personal things are gone.}

<A>__{schindler's mercedes, the backseat piled high with suitcases. a border guard returns his passport to him. the barrier is lifted and he crosses into czech countryside.}
<L>__{interior square, brinnlitz, czechoslovakia morning}
<A>__{a church in the main square of a sleepy hamlet. a priest and his parishioners, including emilie schindler, emerging from it, morning mass over. some guys outside a bar cafe, hanging gout, drinking, notice the elegantly dressed gentleman outside the town's only hotel. they recognize him. they come over.}

<D>__{hey, how you doing?}
<C>__{brinnlitz guy 1}
<D>__{look at this.}
<A>__{schindler, the clothes, the car, the suitcases, the great difference between their respective stations in life. somehow their old ne'er do well friend has managed to do quite well, and it amazes them. across the square, emilie has noticed him; and he, her. but neither makes a move toward the other. finally she walks away; which schindler interprets correctly to mean, yes, check into the hotel. he tips the porter extravagantly and turns back to the guys from the bar.}
