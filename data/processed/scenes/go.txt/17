<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{three out of four lights are burned out in the hallway. a few feet ahead of ronna, a door stands partly ajar. a weird red and green light spills out through the crack, along with an alice in chains song.}
<L>__{interior apartment living room night}
<A>__{ronna pushes the door open from the hallway.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{todd?}
<A>__{shades drawn, the room is completely insulated from reality. the light bulbs have been markered over, casting eerie pools of red and green light. broken cd's dangle off a tiny christmas tree by the stereo. slacker seasonalism.}
<C>__{gaines }
<D>__{don't let the cat out.}
<A>__{ronna closes the door behind her. todd gaines emerges from the darkened bedroom, tying the string on a pair of sweat pants. that's all he's wearing.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{i didn't wake you up, did i?}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{nah.}
<A>__{he settles into an overstuffed couch and lights a marlboro. adjusts himself in the crotch. motions for her to take a chair. she's more nervous than she wants to let on.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{i thought you were still buying quarters off simon. least what simon pretends are quarters.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{i keep him honest.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{at that level you're supposed to pinch. it's the economics of it.}
<B>__{in the background}
<A>__{a woman with a ballerina's body comes out of the bedroom. she tucks an unrealistically large breast down into her tight top.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{you leaving?}
<A>__{she leans over the back of the sofa for quick, tonguey kiss. in a sneak attack, she shoves a santa's hat down to his ears. he bats the white pom out of his eyes.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{be good.}
<A>__{the woman is out the door without a word. gaines looks back over at ronna, not the least bit self conscious about the hat.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{i take it this is not a social call.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{i need a favor.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{a favor? wow. i didn't know we were such good friends, ronna. because if we were, you would know i give head before i give favors. i don't even give my best friends head, so the chance of your getting a favor right now are pretty fucking slim.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you might try just telling me what you want to buy.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{twenty hits of ecstacy.}
<A>__{he takes a deep drag on the cigarette, looking at her. blows the smoke out. he picks up a remote control. aims it at the stereo.}
<B>__{close up}
<A>__{the volume meter, climbing fast. out of the green, into the red. the music is deafening.}
<B>__{on gaines}
<A>__{on top of ronna, face in her ear. his hand wraps around her head, holding her tight. we can't hear what he's saying. ronna's eyes betray her fear. he backs off. she looks confused. he nods. do it. the music still blaring, she stands and slowly unbuttons her shirt. takes it off very self consciously. pulls her t shirt off over her head. just her bra underneath. he motions for her to turn around. she does, then back. her hands are shaking. she holds them together. gaines aims the remote at the stereo. the music retreats.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{you come here out of the blue asking for twenty hits. just so happens twenty is the magic number where intent to sell becomes trafficking.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{todd, i would never fuck you like that.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{how would you fuck me? would you strap it on?}
<A>__{he climbs over the sofa to a dresser. in a drawer, he digs down through a pile of socks to find a wide mouthed bottle. and an empty tylenol bottle. blows out the dust.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{what's the occasion?}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{there's this big christmas party thing. warehouse, you know. a bunch of us are doing sort of a pre party thing.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{friends of yours. you're not going to go and try to sell this on me, are you?}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{you're not dealing.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{swear to god.}
<A>__{he transfers pills from the big bottle to the tylenol bottle.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{this is the real thing. pharmaceutical grade, not that crunchy herbal rave shit. don't let anyone double dose or you'll be frying eggs off `em in the emergency room. one hit per headbanger.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{understood.}
<A>__{he snaps the cap on tight.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{twenty at fifteen is 300.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{fifteen? i was thinking more like ten.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{you already did strap it on.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{it's just that i know you charge simon ten.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{inflation's a bitch.}
<A>__{he offers it to ronna, who doesn't reach out for it.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{here's the deal. there's 20 of us. i need all of this. but i only have two hundred. i mean, that's all i have.}
<A>__{gaines undoes the cap of the tylenol bottle, starts pouring the pills back out.}
<C>__{ronna }
<D>__{no, hear me out. this two hundred is like a downpayment. you give me the stuff, i get the extra hundred from them, then i come right back and pay you.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{see, that would be doing you a favor, and you know how i feel about favors.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{i could leave something with you. collateral.}
<A>__{he gives her a quick look over.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{i already got a fucking swatch. i need something i know you'll come back for.}
<A>__{ronna looks at the tylenol bottle in his hands. thinking...}
