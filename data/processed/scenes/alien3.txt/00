<A>__{on a narrow ledge, twenty feet about the glassworks' floor. his clothing is medieval. a rough textured cassock. he is a monk. louvers are set into the wall. he angles them open. the smoke begins to escape. the monk turns, raises arms and leaps from his lofty perch gently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a flowing fox a primitive hand held pulley that runs down a rope. he lands next to the glass furnace, surrounded by }

<B>__{one particular monk}
<A>__{black skinned, early fifties. stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but he is watching something else. it moves him to song. lilting tenor lifts high into the air. this is brother kyle.}
