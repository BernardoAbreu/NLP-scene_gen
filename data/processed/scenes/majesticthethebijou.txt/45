<A>__{harry enters the office, doffs his hat, revealing a full head of snow white hair. he nods to eldridge and lardner, and slowly turns to face pete. he looks closer... and closer. hesitantly, he takes a couple of steps towards pete, who slowly rises out of his chair to meet the old man's gaze. finally, they're standing practically toe to toe.}
<B>__{pete}
<A>__{looks a bit puzzled, but the old man has such a sweet face...}
<B>__{harry}
