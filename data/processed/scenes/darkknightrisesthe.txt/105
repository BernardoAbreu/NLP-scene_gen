<L>__{interior hall, wayne manor continuous (night)}
<A>__{as wayne hits the bottom of the stairs, alfred calls.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{i will get this to fox. but no more.}
<A>__{wayne hears his tone of voice. turns to him.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{i've sewn you up and set your bones...but i won't bury you. i've buried enough members of the wayne family.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{you'd abandon me?}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{you see only one end to your story. leaving is all i have to make you understand: you aren't batman anymore you have to find another way. you used to talk about finishing. about life beyond that awful cave }
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{rachel died knowing we'd decided to be together. that was my life beyond this cave and i can't just move on. she didn't. she couldn't.}
<A>__{alfred considers this. looks away.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{what if he had? what if she wasn't intending to make a life with you?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{she was, i can't change that }
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{what if, before she died, she'd written a letter? explaining that she'd chosen harvey dent over you?}
<A>__{wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say }
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{and what if, to spare you pain...i'd burned that letter?}
<A>__{wayne stares at alfred, shocked.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{why would you say such a thing?}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{because i have to make you understand.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{you're lying.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{because you are as precious to me as you were to your own mother and father and i swore to them that i would protect you and i haven't.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{you're lying!}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{i've never lied to you. except when i burned rachel's letter.}
<A>__{wayne turns on the old man, furious.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{how dare you use rachel to stop me!}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{i'm using the truth, master wayne. maybe it's time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and just let it have its day. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{sorry?! you expect to destroy my world, then shake hands?!}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{no. i know what this means }
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{what does it mean, alfred?!}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{it means your hatred. it means losing the person i've cared for ever since i heard his first cries echo through this house. but it might also mean saving your life. and that is more important.}
<A>__{wayne looks at alfred. furious. summons the worst thing to say and says it quietly and calmly.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{goodbye, alfred.}
<C>__{alfred}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{goodbye, bruce.}
<A>__{wayne mounts the stairs...alfred watches him go. turns.}
