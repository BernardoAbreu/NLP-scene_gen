<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{heading south along a state highway, sandro's car is traveling at high speed over a straight open road. it is twilight and as the evening shadows begin to fall, the surrounding countryside is bathed in an aura of mystery. inside the car anna, claudia and sandro sit in complete silence. anna is deeply absorbed in her own thoughts. claudia is looking out of the window, enthralled by the dark beauty of the landscape. another car draws up alongside of sandro's and is about to pass him. but sandro steps on the accelerator and pulls ahead with a tremendous burst of speed. the other car lags behind and then turns off at a crossroad. however, sandro makes no attempt to slow down. in fact, spurred on by what has now become a definitely hostile atmosphere, he drives even faster. as sandro suddenly switches on the headlights, the violent glare that polarizes the roadside cuts off claudia's view. she turns to sandro with a look of disappointment}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{it was lovelier before.}
<A>__{to please her, sandro turns the headlights off and once again the countryside is covered by a veil of thick but romantic shadows.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{like this?}
<A>__{now claudia again peers out at the landscape but only for an instant. sandro abruptly turns the headlights on again, revealing a sharp curve in the road up ahead, only about a hundred yards away. he quickly shifts into lower gear, and the car swerves slightly. the sudden shift from fourth to third gear causes the motor to emit a sound that resembles a cry. the car races swiftly towards the curve, getting closer and closer. but at such high speed it appears impossible the car will be able to make the turn. further up ahead, where the curve fades, there is a stone wall that runs along the side of the road. at this point, even anna is attentive, her eyes wide open. both she and claudia are petrified and terror stricken as the curve and the wall loom closer and closer. fifty yards, forty, ten. all of a sudden, the headlights illuminate a large gap in the wall about three or four yards away, just on the other side of a small ditch that separates the road from the wall itself. there seems to be no other choice. with a frightening leap and going well over fifty miles an hour the car barely makes it over the ditch and right through the opening in the wall. the car comes to a sudden halt, but skids along on the muddy ground of an empty lot until it finally stops near the door of a small farmhouse in front of an old man. he is seated on a bench and has been observing the entire scene without budging an inch. there is a brief pause silence. then sandro comes out of the car followed by claudia and anna. claudia is visibly shaken. she leans up against the building for support, as though in search of something solid and dependable. she is also unnerved by the feeling that she is responsible for what has just happened.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{it's all my fault!}
<A>__{but instead of reproaching her, sandro turns to the old man and excuses himself for having broken into his property. imperturbably, the old man looks up at him and says:}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{and who do you think made that hole over there?}
<A>__{even before he has a chance to be surprised at the old man's remark, sandro becomes aware that anna is laughing. it is not the hysterical laugh that normally might be expected after such a close call. it is, instead a pure and simple laugh, almost a happy one, and leaves both sandro and claudia plainly baffled.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{there's nothing much to laugh at.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{and that's what i say, too. we could have all been killed.}
<A>__{anna looks at them as she continues to laugh.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm sorry ... but i can't help laughing...}
