<A>__{rhiannon, clutching an enormous diet coke, plods through the mall with an intensity reserved for girls who just found out their best friend had her sophomore sexual exploit and didn't bother to tell them.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{i have many questions, obviously.}
<T>__{we intercut between the two locations:}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(playfully)}
<D>__{yes, virginia, there is a santa claus. no, in fact, i do not know the way to san jose. and little known fact contrary to popular belief, panama hats are not from panama at all! they're from ecuador! who knew?}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{now is not the time to be cute.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{you're putting me in a precarious position, because }
<P>__{(with her best jackie o voice)}
<D>__{ `according to last month's cosmopolitan magazine, we should always look cute. even when we're doing mundane activities such as choosing vegetables from the produce section of our local grocery store.'}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{olive, stop it. this is serious. did you really bang brandon last night at melanie dipshit's party?}
<A>__{olive sighs as she slumps into her pillows.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{is that what people are saying happened?}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{that's what everyone is saying.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{then i guess it's true.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{does this mean you guys are dating?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{god no.}
<A>__{rhiannon screams in frustration, attracting the attention of passing shoppers.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{just because you lost your virginity doesn't mean you can go around screwing everybody!}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(off put)}
<D>__{uh, thanks mom. good talk.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{you're getting a reputation.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{y'know, you're really coming off as a little pious right now and you're kind of pissing me off.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{please forgive my rectitude, but i think that a best friend's duty is to let her know that everyone and i do mean everyone is calling her a cum dumpster.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{well, do you think i'm a cum dumpster?}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{look, baby, i call a spade a spade.}
<A>__{entering the red zone }
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{first off, that's racist. secondly, fuck you! how dare you? i was laura ingalls to your lady chatterly and, now all of a sudden, you feel the need to warn me that i'm making a fool of myself? there are a lot of children who will never again experience family pizza night because of you. so, why don't you jump off your high horse and splash around in the gutter where you belong.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{i didn't want to believe it, but i guess it's true. you're a fucktart.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{and you're a jealous virgin.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{oh yeah. i totally want to lose my virginity to one of }
<P>__{(as if it was a disease)}
<D>__{ your brother's friends and then be the first for a fairy, while everyone listens outside! what is wrong with you? does sex mean anything to you?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{yes! it's a period of time, how ever short, that i don't have to talk to you!}
<A>__{she slams the phone down into the cradle and seethes. berlin's `sex (i'm a...)' plays loudly as... she goes into her closet and starts, wildly, pulling down clothes. she throws them into a big pile in the middle of her floor.}
