<A>__{he's parked on an overpass. the sign hollenbeck bridge on one of its concrete columns. gittes looks down into the riverbed below.}
<B>__{from the bridge}
<A>__{gittes can see the muddy remains of a collapsed shack, its contents strewn down river from the bridge. below him, lying half over the storm drain and one wall that was on the bank of the river is a sign that proclaims "own your own office in this building $5000 to $6000" which was used as a roof of sorts. downstream, there's the dresser, an oil drum, a ford seat cushion, an armour lard can, etc. the trashy remains of shuhardt's home. gittes scrambles down the embankment and as he lands near the storm drain one shoe sinks, ankle deep into mud. gittes pulls it out, swearing. he begins to walk a little further downstream when he hears the vaguely familiar squishy clop of something. clearing the bridge on the opposite side is the little mexican boy, again on his swayback horse, riding along the muddy bank. they look at one another a moment.}
