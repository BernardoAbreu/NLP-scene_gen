<A>__{eli and solara follow the road through burned out towns and retail neighborhoods. gutted and dead, like every place else. but something is different here. things are greener. tufts of grass here and there. they attract solara's attention.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{eli reaches down and runs his hand through the grass.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's grass. it used to grow all over the place.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{how come it's here?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i don't know. less poison in the air this near to the ocean, maybe.}
<A>__{they keep walking. eli groans, clutches his side. does his best to hide his pain from solara. she notices anyway.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{nothing. just a cramp.}
