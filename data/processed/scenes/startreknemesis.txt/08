<L>__{exterior earth, alaska pavilion later}
<A>__{the party guests mingle as a band plays. we are at a beautiful open air pavilion high in the denali mountains. the soaring ranges of riker's native alaska can be seen everywhere around us. dr. beverly crusher goes to picard.}
<C>__{beverly}
<P>__{(playfully)}
<D>__{sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{please, beverly, this is hard enough.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{if you start tearing up i promise to beam you out. level one medical emergency. there's no crying in starfleet.}
<A>__{they head off toward riker and deanna. meanwhile, geordi la forge sits with his girlfriend.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{i've never seen your captain so nostalgic. maybe he's getting soft in his old age.}
<C>__{geordi}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{not likely. after we installed the new series four replicators, he tried to order his usual tea and there was a glitch. had us remove the whole bunch of them and put the old ones back in.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{there! nostalgic about old replicators.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{he just likes things the way he likes them...}
<P>__{(he looks at her, smiles)}
<D>__{of course, so do i.}
<A>__{he kisses her gently as worf comes to them. poor worf is still suffering a bit from the bachelor party. he plops down beside them, belches.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{romulan ale should be illegal.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{it is, old chum.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{then it should be more illegal.}
<A>__{he groans and rests his head on the table, acts like he's going to heave. meanwhile, riker and deanna are talking to picard and beverly.}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{really, captain, it was a lovely toast.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{the least i could do for you, deanna. besides, you know me... i'm a talking head.}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{and you needn't worry. i will brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{the hell you will. you know too much about me as it is... now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on betazed.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{no, no speeches. no clothes either.}
<P>__{(winks, mischievously)}
<A>__{picard looks at him. deanna laughs. then the band stops playing. all turn. data stands with the band.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen and invited tran gendered species... in my study of terran and betazoid conjugal rites i have discovered it is traditional to present the "happy couple" with a gift. given commander riker's affection for archaic musical forms i have elected to present the following as my gift in honor of their conjugation.}
<A>__{riker shoots an amused glance to deanna. conjugation? data turns to the band leader.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{if you please, mister band leader, a one and a two and...}
<A>__{the band launches into a jaunty, swing version of the irving berlin standard "blue skies."}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(sings)}
<D>__{"blue skies, smiling at me, nothing but blue skies do i see. blue birds, singing a song, nothing but blue birds all day long. never saw the sun shining so bright, never saw things going so right..."}
<A>__{the crowd is appreciative. loves the song. except worf, he momentarily raises his head from the table.}
<C>__{worf}
<P>__{(groans)}
<D>__{ugghhh... irving berlin.}
<A>__{his heads thumps down again, is about ready to barf! meanwhile, riker is anxious as a kid to join the band:}
<C>__{deanna}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{all right, go ahead.}
<A>__{riker eagerly joins the band. grabs the trombone and starts jamming with the orchestra. the song really swings.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(to deanna)}
<D>__{may i have this dance?}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{with pleasure, captain.}
<A>__{meanwhile, geordi leads leah to the dance floor as well. beverly goes to worf.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{commander worf... do klingons swing?}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{i am not a swinger. i am unwell.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{don't worry, i'm a doctor.}
<A>__{she pulls him to the dance floor as:}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{i'm so glad you made it back to the enterprise before i left.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{i was not suited for the life of a... diplomat.}
<C>__{beverly}
<P>__{(wry)}
<D>__{who'd have guessed?}
<A>__{they dance. picard and deanna sweep past them. and we pull up and away as data continues to sing and the crew dances. it is a joyous celebration of these people. this family. a family we love.}
