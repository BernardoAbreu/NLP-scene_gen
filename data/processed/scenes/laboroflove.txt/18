<A>__{maurice notices the strain in her voice.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{is this going to be similar to the flower incident?}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(very emotional)}

<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{so what have you done for me that's so earth shattering?}
<A>__{the waiter closest to the table cringes with maurice's words. ellen drains of color. she stares at him in complete and utter disbelief. she drills him with this iron glare for an eternity then grabs her purse and heads to the exit. maurice stares at the table for a moment to gather what's left of his dignity and follows her out. the waiter moves to the table and clears the aftermath. he sees ellen's fortune crumpled next to her tea cup. he unravels it. the fortune reads...}
<D>__{"you are a friendly and generous person."}
