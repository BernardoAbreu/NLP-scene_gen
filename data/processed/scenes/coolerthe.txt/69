<L>__{interior bernie's motel room night}
<A>__{bernie sits watching tv, a bottle of ten high next to him on the bed. same religious channel. this time it's a mass baptism taking place on some river bank. he's about to doze off, when he hears a light rapping on the door. he cocks his head, not sure if it's the booze talking. bernie throws open the door natalie standing there. a lonely angel framed in the doorway. suitcase at her feet. 24 carat tears glistening in the dark. they just stare at each other for an extended beat. then natalie stumbles into bernie's arms. clingwraps herself to him. bernie squeezes his eyes closed. holds on for dear life. it's a different kind of pain now; one that hurts so good.}

<A>__{from over bernie's shoulder. there's a bittersweet look about her. nothing good can come of this. but that's tomorrow. a long ways off.}
