<A>__{tony, sweating, panting for breath, is running up the mountain. below, the mob is still in hot pursuit. tony reaches the summit. in front of him, is his salvation an empty gibbet. a noose hangs from the crossbeam.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{thank god for that!}
<A>__{tony relaxes a little. we can hear the mob now, struggling up the mountain. tony digs into one of his pockets and pulls out the brass tube that he has always kept close. tony opens his mouth and is about to slip the tube down his throat when he spots the hanged man tarot card lying at his feet. a hand from behind him snatches the tube away. tony, startled, turns to find himself looking up at dr.}
<B>__{parnassus.}
<A>__{parnassus is standing on a chair with the noose around his neck. he smiles and opens his hand. the metal tube has vanished. tony panics. the mob is getting closer. with his other hand dr. parnassus produces the tube from tony's ear.}

<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{give me that!}
<A>__{dr. parnassus gestures at the crowd.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{give us a moment, please.}
<A>__{the crowd goes into very slow motion...but twice as angry. dr. parnassus teases tony with magic.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus }
<D>__{here's your tube... here's mine.}
<P>__{(producing a second tube)}
<D>__{but mine's just a cheap counterfeit... look, it breaks...}
<P>__{(he breaks it)}
<D>__{but here's another...}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{stop!}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{you're not amused?}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{you've been talking to the devil, haven't you? let me guess what he said... if you manage to kill me, he'll release valentina. yes? am i right?... i am aren't i? it's all lies. he can't release her. and why not? because he doesn't have her. he can't have her because she's the prize.}
<P>__{(gaining confidence)}
<D>__{he doesn't have five wins. but if you kill me he will, won't he? you'll have lost valentina forever!}
<A>__{dr. parnassus does a double hand shuffle.}

<C>__{tony}
<D>__{this is ridiculous!}

<C>__{tony}
<D>__{you've got to believe me! for all our sakes!}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{are you sure you made the right choice?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{look...}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{let's find out.}
<A>__{he slides the tube down his throat and kicks the chair away. he drops... dangles from the rope...the noose tight around his neck. at the same moment, the mob resumes normal speed and roars up the mountain. is parnassus dead? working very fast, tony hoists him over his shoulder and wrestles the noose loose. he drops parnassus on the ground. he's stunned but still alive. the mob is closing in. tony slaps dr. parnassus hard between the shoulder blades. the tube pops out of the doctor's gullet. tony catches it.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{gotcha!}
<A>__{tony swallows the tube as the mob surge around the gibbet, grabbing him, beating him, and then lifting him onto the chair, tightening the noose around his neck. although battered, tony winks smugly at dr. parnassus, but his mood changes when he sees dr. parnassus spit out several more fake tubes, then, gagging, force the real one up and out of his gullet. with a look of realization and horror, tony drops to his death as the mob kicks the chair away from under him. the mob cheers. yes, he's dead. dr. parnassus tosses the metal tube to mr nick who steps coolly out of the mob, cigarette in his mouth.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(hoarsely)}
<D>__{there are three cardinal rules. one, there's no black magic, only cheap tricks. and... er... i forget the others. now, where's my daughter?}

<D>__{how should i know? you're her father.}
<P>__{(with needle)}
<D>__{her loving father.}
<A>__{dr parnassus looks askance at mr nick.}
<C>__{mr nick }
