<A>__{the man actually kicks the glass with his foot, then leans against the glass, shades his eyes, trying to see in.}
<C>__{mulvaney }
<D>__{sorry... i can't talk now... i will call you back.}
<A>__{sound of hanging up. the man is looking all around.}
<B>__{sal and mulvaney}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{get rid of him.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{howard, wave him off. tell him we're closed. whatever...}
<B>__{on howard}
<A>__{who is useless.}
<B>__{on mulvaney}
<A>__{who starts to move toward the front door, looking over at sonny trying to put out the fire. camera follows mulvaney to the front door; sonny moves with him, covering him all the time.}
<B>__{angle on front door}
<A>__{as sonny stands behind closed venetian blinds to listen to the conversation and to cover mulvaney.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{the gun's right on your back...}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{give me the keys...}
<A>__{sonny hands him the keys. very close shot sal he raises the gun and sights it now, and in this moment, we should sense a kind of luxurious relaxation into anticipation on sal's part. he is smiling a little, and for the first time, looks happy, and that's what makes him seem dangerous. he's looking forward to an excuse to kill. it's here now: survival. there is something almost sexual about the way he settles his body down behind the weapon, getting ready for the squeeze on the trigger, the report, the violent shove of recoil against his muscles and sinews. in the background, we see sylvia bringing howard a cup of water.}
<B>__{angle on door}
<A>__{emphasizing the small of mulvaney's back. the man is somebody he knows from across the street. he looks worried and mystified...}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<P>__{(unlocking door)}
<D>__{what is it, sam?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{everything's all right? you okay?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket.}
<A>__{silence. sam stares around... thinking.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you all right?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{little smoke: like a polish four alarm fire, is all.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah. well, you're okay?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{he's not satisfied, but he can't see anything and he can't think of anything more to say, so...}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{thanks again, sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm glad it's okay.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{it's okay. [regards to the family, sam.]}
<A>__{mulvaney locks the door and walks inside the bank, giving the keys back to sonny.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{for god's sake, will you please go now? we gave you every nickel we got.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{you're goin' outside with me. if there's no cops around, we just split. otherwise, you go with us.}
<A>__{mulvaney and sonny starts to walk back toward sal. as they do, the phone begins to ring again (#3).}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(to mulvaney)}
<D>__{answer it.}
<A>__{mulvaney shrugs helplessly. picks up the phone, standing at desk opposite his.}

<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{sal, get 'em in the vault.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{where's the money?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{get 'em in the vault!}
<A>__{as sal starts to herd them into the vault (sylvia helping howard, still with the cup of water), mulvaney is still on the phone. sonny moves down to get the money bag atop the teller's cages and we hear mulvaney on phone.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<P>__{(tired)}
<D>__{what property is that, mrs. anterio? the third avenue property you already got a second mortgage on. we discussed it before...}
<B>__{angle at vault}
<A>__{the girls are afraid; miriam unlocks the gate as sonny uses mulvaney's keys to the matching lock.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(from inside vault area)}
<D>__{you won't close the vault? how can we breathe?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{no, that's okay... just close the gate...}
<A>__{sylvia, helping howard, is the last to go through the gate. as sonny is about to lock the gate, she turns to him.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{listen, i will never make it. i will have to go to the toilet.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what's the matter... they never housebroke you?}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{it's not a joke. i got this terrible fear of being locked in...}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{goddamn women...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{ah shit. okay... go ahead. anybody else have to go?}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{me, too, please.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{you see... now they all gotta go.}
<A>__{as sylvia starts to move out, sonny starts to cross ahead of her.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{wait a minute i want to check.}
<A>__{mulvaney finishes his phone conversation. he moves toward the group at the vault.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{as sonny sprints for the door to the ladies' room. inside ladies' room it is a little lounge; sitting on a couch under the window, making up her face (or painting her toenails) and listening to her tiny transistor radio, oblivious to all that's happened, is maria, heavily painted and voluptuous latin girl. sylvia, following him in, is shocked. she's forgotten about maria. now she runs over to her, puts her arms around her.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{oh maria!}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{who the hell is that? god damn it! what the...}
<A>__{maria is about to protest, but sylvia grabs her and starts to hustle her out.}

<D>__{what are you trying to pull?}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{i forgot she's in here.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{come on, nobody's going to the bathroom come on...}
<A>__{he moves with them back to the vault area, herds them into it. at this point, phone rings again (#4). sonny moves to get the empty wastebasket, shoving it into the vault for the girls to use in case of emergency. mulvaney moves to his desk and phone. mulvaney has by this time answered the phone, and is now holding it out to sonny. hold the beat...}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<P>__{(to sonny)}
<D>__{it's for you.}
<B>__{on sonny and sal}
<A>__{they both stare at mulvaney. sonny slowly moves toward mulvaney. for the first time since he entered the bank, he's quiet and slow. he takes the instrument and slowly puts it to his ear. the group from the vault now slowly starts to move out to listen to the conversation.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{moretti }
<D>__{what are you doin' in there?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{who's this?}
<C>__{moretti }
<D>__{this is detective sergeant moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls. you don't believe me, i'm lookin' you right in the eye. right now, i can see you...}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{who is it?}
<A>__{sonny turns and looks out through the door. sure enough, in the window of the barbershop across the street, the dim figure of a man on a telephone can be seen looking out toward us. he wears a hat in spite of the weather and a cigar is clamped in his mouth. he is an old time, hard nosed, uneducated, street wise, sarcastic new york cop, outspoken, rude and sentimental. right now he's a distant silhouette and a voice on the telephone.}
<B>__{close on sonny}
<A>__{holding the phone. listening to the voice of his death speaking in new york accents.}
<C>__{moretti }
<D>__{okay? let's be reasonable and not stupid and not get anybody hurt. you come to the front door with hands folded on your head, unnastand? nobody's gonna shoot or...}
<A>__{sonny slowly, almost sadly, puts the telephone receiver back down, cutting off the little voice at the other end. he looks up at mulvaney, then to sal.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(to sal)}
<D>__{it's the cops. shit!}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{how'd that happen?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<P>__{(backing away from sonny)}
<D>__{i swear to god... on my salary, i'm not gonna be any hero...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i took too long.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{it was the fire, asshole!}
<A>__{sonny paces.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{i told you, just go, get out when you could, but no, you just got to hang around.}
<A>__{sonny is pacing back and forth, trying to figure out what to do.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{oh, shit! i gotta have time to think.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{what is it? did you just barge in here... he doesn't have plan. it's all a whim.}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{'rob a bank! what not?'}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{...just give me time to think...}
<A>__{phone starts to ring (#5).}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{we're all in the barrel together...}
<A>__{phone continues to ring. sonny finally grabs it (desk opposite mulvaney).}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{all right, bastards! you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time. you got that?}
<A>__{a startled apologetic man's voice speaks: now another phone begins to ring (#6).}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{i just called to ask jenny what time she's gonna get off.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{who's this?}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{it's her husband.}
<A>__{sonny abruptly holds the phone out from his body at arm's length, disgusted.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{is there a jenny here?}
<A>__{nobody moves. they all stare at him. finally he singles her out.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{it's your husband.}
<A>__{jenny starts to move toward sonny.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what do i say?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{tell him the truth! tell him whatever you tell him!}
<A>__{other phone continues to ring (#6). as he puts down the phone for her to pick up, sonny reaches for the other phone that is ringing.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what a fuckin' comedy!}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{wnew plays all the hits.}
<C>__{moretti }
<D>__{listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{...but you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... you got it? okay?}
<A>__{he hangs up the phone. sal looks at him.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{you mean that?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{...the bodies out the door.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i want him to think that.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{but do you mean it?}
<A>__{at this moment, jenny, phone in hand, is turned to him, respectfully like a child in an authoritarian household, addressing her father:}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{he wants to know what time you think you'll be through.}
<B>__{on sonny}
<A>__{stares at her. for the first time, he realizes how frightened she is, how serious, grotesque, and funny it all is. he takes the time to be tender with her, as though she were a not too bright child in the presence of a tragedy she'll never understand.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{tell him i don't know.}
<A>__{now sonny turns to speak to mulvaney.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{where's the back door?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{it's locked on the inside.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's through that passageway and to the right.}
<A>__{sonny disappears toward the back door. jenny continues her phone conversation.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{jenny?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{he says he doesn't know. why don't you cook whatever's there?}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{it looks like a whole roast.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{honey, send out for kentucky fried chicken. the baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef. the bottles are in the fridge.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<P>__{(to jenny)}
<D>__{hurry up!}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{i know how to fix the bottle. they got guns?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(with the baby on her mind)}
<D>__{what guns?}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{the robbers in the bank. they got guns?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yeah. a lot of guns.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{well, stay away from them. don't get close.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh, yeah, i will...}
<A>__{now sonny returns from the rear door area, sees that she's still on the phone and signals to her to hurry up.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{hey, jenny let's go...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{hon? i got to go.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{jenny hesitates. everyone is looking at her. they look away, as though to give her privacy.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yeah. well, i got to go now...}
<A>__{a beat of silence. realizes she can't talk...}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{i will kiss the baby for you.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(past embarrassment)}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{she hangs up and then crosses to the group by the vault.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{on sonny as he moves to sal, to reassure sal out of some guiltiness about trapping him in this situation. his tone apologetic... almost tender...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{sal, i'm sorry about this. but we can get outta this thing. there's a way outta this.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{are you serious? about throwin' a body outta here if we have to?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{well, i stalled him for a while. when it comes the time, then we'll work it out. okay?}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{but do you mean it?... but you just told him that if worse comes to worse...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i want him to think that.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{but i want to know what you think.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{we won't have to.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{i will tell you right now that i'm ready to do it.}
<A>__{now sonny moves over to the group at the vault gate and speaks to them.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what i want to say is... everything's gonna be all right... if we all cooperate and we don't, you know... carry on... i don't know you and you don't know me... and what i'm tryin' to tell you is that if you stay cooled out, we can work this thing out and nobody's going to get hurt... believe me, i don't want to hurt anybody... everybody is going to have a chance to do what they have to do... she's gotta go to the bathroom so you go and you can go after... everybody's gonna get a chance... everybody's gonna get a chance to use the phone... let's just take it a step at a time.}
<A>__{sonny now turns toward mulvaney. howard lies down, head on jacket, in the vault.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(to mulvaney)}
<D>__{now, you what's your name?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{mulvaney...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{you and me are checking the other ways in and out.}
<A>__{sal takes a position where he can cover the door and also the girls and howard.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{as sonny and mulvaney move toward the rear of the bank.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{let's go to the back door.}
<P>__{(referring to howard)}
<D>__{how'd that guy get to be a guard?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{well, they go to guard school.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{to what... learn how to shoot? they don't get a gun.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{they make $105 a week to start. they fold the flag, check the place out in the morning. i don't know what they learn, sonny.}
<A>__{at some point in their move toward the rear door, sylvia exits the ladies' room and moves back toward the group.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{here we are... the back door.}
<A>__{they look at it. it is big, black, steel and seems solid. sonny tests it.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{they could shoot the lock... i want to block it, so if they try comin' here, we're gonna hear it. here, you pull on that side.}
<P>__{(puts gun aside)}
<A>__{he has found a big office machine, a xerox or whatever, which he now starts to push toward the door. on the opposite side, mulvaney starts to pull it toward the door. it's very heavy and they have to strain to budge it at all. meanwhile:}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{you got kids?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{i got two kids... and i'd like to see them again.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{ah, i know! you're being very cooperative. i got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance?}
<A>__{mulvaney has removed his suit jacket.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{you know i do. you seem to know a lot about bank procedure.}
<A>__{sonny laughs and pushes the machine. mulvaney pulls from the opposite side.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{don't ask me questions. i got connections. you find out who i am, you're cold meat.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{i don't care who you are...}
<P>__{(shove)}
<D>__{i just want to get you outta here, safe, right?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what if i take you with me?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<P>__{(stopping to rest for a beat, thinking)}
<D>__{if you take anybody, please take me.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{they'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you... they don't give a damn. in spite of that bank insurance. you see what they did in attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty.}
<A>__{they have the machine almost to the door now, with mulvaney almost pinned between the machine and the door. he eases himself out. looks at the gun, then at sonny, then they shove the machine against the door. sonny then gives mulvaney his jacket to put on again.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{anyway, i'm not gonna take you. i'm gonna take one of the girls, a married one with a couple of kids. the cops don't like it in the papers when they kill a mother, especially if she's got young kids.}
<A>__{finished with the task, sonny takes his gun and with mulvaney, they start to cross back toward sal and the rest of the group.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{you're just a nice guy, mr. mulvaney. only don't fuck around with me, you know what i mean?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{i don't fool around with you.}
<A>__{mulvaney crosses back to his desk and sits down. at this point, all the phones are off the hooks.}
