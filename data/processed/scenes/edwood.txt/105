<L>__{exterior restaurant patio day}
<A>__{we're at a fancy outdoor brunch. ed is shaking hands with pretty loretta king, 25, a pale brunette in a classy dress.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{pleased to meet you. i'm loretta king.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i understand you just moved here?}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{yes. hollywood is oh so exciting.}
<A>__{a waiter walks over, with a water pitcher.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{water, ma'am?}
<C>__{loretta}
<P>__{(suddenly freaking out)}
<D>__{no! no water! no liquids! i'm terribly allergic to them!}
<A>__{the waiter is bewildered. he hurries away. ed leans in.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{so my associate mr. marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{perhaps a small amount of money.}
<P>__{(she smiles)}
<D>__{how much do one of your motion pictures cost?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{for this one, we need $60,000.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{that's all?? that seems very reasonable for an entire picture.}
<A>__{ed perks up. she's a live one! ed pulls a script from his briefcase and hands it to her.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{oh my, this is very interesting.}
<P>__{(she skims the pages)}
<D>__{say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(very enthused)}
<D>__{oh, of course!! there's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: the secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{hmm. those sound kind of small.}
<P>__{(stopping at a page)}
<D>__{oh, here's one that looks good: janet lawton. i'd sure like to play her.}
<A>__{ed blanches.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{j janet lawton???}
<C>__{loretia}
<D>__{yes, janet layton is clearly the part to play. she's got some real meaty scenes! can't you just see me in that part??}
<A>__{cu ed he is aghast. what a stomach churning decision. he stares at loretta, then slowly croaks a response.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{uh... yeah...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you'd be perfect.}
