<L>__{exterior boat deck day}
<A>__{the sun is up. the engine is dead. the ballgame is heard over ship's radio. the men are scattered over the boat. taber and mcmurphy, beer in hand, are sunning themselves, listening to the ballgame. on the stern martini and scanlon are trying to rig up a pole. fredrickson gives them a hand. billy has a line out. so does bromden and sefelt who is seated nearby, fishing the ocean floor when he suddenly gets a bite and looks over the side, surprised. his line goes straight down into the depths. his glasses fall off into the water. sefelt sighs and slowly begins reeling his line in. billy gets a strike and starts fighting the fish.}

<A>__{they start a tug of war. fredrickson tries to break it up, when he gets a strike and his line spins out. billy's fish breaks into the sun in a shower of silver scales, and he gets so excited he lets the end of the pole go down and the line snaps.}
