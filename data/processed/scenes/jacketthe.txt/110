<L>__{interior lorenson's office, alpine grove, 2004}
<A>__{lorenson leans against her desk while starks and jackie sit in the chairs. as they talk, each seems cautious in his exchange not knowing what the other one does or doesn't know.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{my god you look exactly like him.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i never knew my father. did you?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{yeah, i did. [beat] he was my most memorable patient.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{lorenson considers her answer.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{at the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you thought my father was crazy?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{no. i don't think he was crazy. he needed help...but he wasn't crazy. [beat] your father actually helped me with a case of mine.}
<A>__{lorenson waits to see if starks knows what she is talking about.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{what case?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i was working with a boy named eugene.}
<A>__{starks shows no recognition but jackie does.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{who was eugene? lorenson [peaked] he was a friend's son. [beat] are you familiar with the case?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{just a little, when we were looking up information about william's father. how did he help?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{it's complicated, but [looking at starks] in a way, your father let me know how i'd get through to him.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{he just said...that i'd shock eugene and then things would change for him.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i still don't either, even after all these years.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{do you know how my father died? lorenson [unconvincingly] i don't know how much i remember but i seem to think it was from a... cut or blow of some sort or another.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{how'd he get it?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{[beat] i don't know.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{but dr. morgan said you were around when my father was...}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i was. but i saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. i'm sorry i don't know more about your father's. [sincerely] i didn't know about everything that went on here.}
<A>__{lorenson says it like she's hiding something.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{well, do you think dr. becker would have any idea?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{how do you know about dr. becker?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{my dad wrote some things down before he died.}
<A>__{lorenson looks like she's suddenly remembering something.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{that's right. he did.}
<A>__{starks looks at lorenson curiously; he doesn't know what lorenson is talking about.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{so maybe dr. becker would know. [beat] but, as i'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{why would we do that?}
<A>__{starks just stares at lorenson, not knowing if he died by this man's hands or not, not knowing who he can trust...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{because becker resigned after the charges brought against him by state patient advocacy groups.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i see you've done your homework. [beat] alpine grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. at the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [beat] now, we do. and things are different.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i wouldn't be so sure. like you said about back then, you might not know everything going on around here.}
<A>__{dr. lorenson looks right at starks.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{it's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] yeah, it is. lorenson [eerily] it's almost as if your life depended on it. isn't it?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] we will.}
