<L>__{exterior flophouse night}
<A>__{it's raining like hell. manny approaches the abandoned flophouse. he peeks through the boarded up front entrance. right there, on the dusty lobby floor, clearer than the larger shoeprints... ...he discovers a trail of tiny, barefoot prints.}
<C>__{manny}
<D>__{chuy...}
<A>__{he kicks experimentally at the planks, but they're far too strong.}
<B>__{alley}
<A>__{manny explores the opposite face of the building, looking for a way in. a dog is barking incessantly. manny turns. something moves in the shadows! something long and thin, haloed by the rain. it moves again, the streetlight touching it for a fleeting moment as it totters around to the rear of the building. it's the overcoat man! the man hurries past. manny sprints after him.}
<B>__{alleys}
<A>__{manny comes running around a pile of grocery crates. there is the overcoat man. cargo workers mill around a group of vegetable trucks, unloading produce. the overcoat man attracts no attention. keeping his head down, staying near the shadowed buildings. jumping and hopping, he skitters into an alley.}
<B>__{following}
<A>__{manny has to trot to keep up with the mysterious figure. he pauses to take a pill and place it under his tongue. once it takes effect he moves on. the overcoat man has moved past a chainlink fence. how?? it's too high!!! the old man squeezes through a jagged opening. the metal fabric cuts his shirt. on the other side: a dead end. nowhere to go except for...}
<B>__{a sewage grate}
<A>__{manny lifts it.}
<B>__{sewage pipe}
<A>__{manny lands on his feet with considerable difficulty. he flicks his lighter flame and opens the straight razor. this pipe is carpeted with trash and a thick crust of dirt. something moves under a wet newspaper: a thick mass of long legged spiders dissolve onto the walls and floor. suddenly...the distant sound of spoons playing.}
<C>__{manny}
<D>__{chuy...}
<A>__{manny pulls a rosary from his pocket, wraps it around his wrist and crosses himself with the razor... ...then begins to move down the pipe.}
