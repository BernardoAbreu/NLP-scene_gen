<A>__{stargher's hands come at her from behind! one grabs her hair and the other covers her face with a chloroform soaked towel. he presses so hard, she cannot scream, cannot move. after a brief struggle, he shoves her into her car and holds her until she passes out. stargher pushes julia into the passenger seat and starts the car. pulls a dog treat from his pocket and whistles. the shepherd instantly perks up. perfectly healthy. and jumps into the car.}
