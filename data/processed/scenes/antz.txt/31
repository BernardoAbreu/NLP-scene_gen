<L>__{exterior lake day}
<A>__{a lake (a puddle) stretches before them. it is, in fact, the overflow of a drinking fountain whose drain is jammed...as z and bala run to the lake, water dribbles from the fountain and into one edge of the pool (to the ants, it's a waterfall). bala and z run to the edge of the water and start slurping. they smile at each other, until they remember that they don't like each other.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{this lake is huge! and so close to the colony! think of the vacation potential!}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{cut me down a soft leaf so i can take a nap.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{listen, "princess", you can't order me around. out here, you're not the boss anymore out here, you're just }
<A>__{ but before he can finish, a water droplet from the fountain falls on him. it may not sound like much, but to z it's as though a ten foot diameter sphere of jello had engulfed him. z's stuck inside because of the surface tension of the droplet, which doesn't burst, just quivers up and down. inside, z is slowly, frantically drowning and screaming for help. but his screams are muffled in the water.}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{out here i'm just what?}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(through the water)}
<D>__{hlllllllp!}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(hands on hips)}
<D>__{stop fooling around in there.}
<A>__{by now the droplet has started rolling, and z is being turned upside down. he manages to get one foreleg out of the droplet, and, in a frantic attempt to pull himself out, pullsbala in by the leg.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{let me go!!!}
<A>__{but it's too late they're now both stuck in the droplet, and, as z continues to drown, he also has to deal with balayelling at him though we can't hear exactly what it. is she's yelling through the water. then, having run out of air, she too starts thrashing, alternately trying to swim and trying to slap him as z tries to defend himself. finally all this commotion is enough to make the droplet burst, spilling the two coughing, sputtering, drenched ants onto the ground. they both lie there, miserable, wet, and cold.}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(chants to herself)}
<D>__{i'm going to be rescued soon. i'm going to be rescued soon. i'm going to be rescued soon.}
<A>__{z watches her incredulously.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're not going to rescue you?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{general formica won't let me die out here. i'm his fiancee.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{look. how many other princesses are there?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{five thousand three hundred and ninety no. about five thousand four hundred by now.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{and only you can become a queen?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{well...no, but }
<C>__{z}
<D>__{so what makes you so special?}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{well...i am the oldest.}
<A>__{bala turns from z. she's thinking things over, realization dawning on her.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{by three seconds...}
<A>__{she looks out into the grass forest.}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{you're right. there are as many princesses...as there are blades of grass.}
<A>__{z, overhearing her, slowly puts his hand on her shoulder.}
