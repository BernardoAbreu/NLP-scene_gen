<L>__{exterior roadside inn day}
<A>__{john and fanny are waiting as the ostlers make the final adjustments to their carriage. the landlord hovers, waiting for a tip.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{a hundred pounds a year to their mother while she lives. would that be more advisable? it is better than parting with the fifteen hundred all at once.}
<A>__{he displays some coins in his hand. fanny removes one and nods.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{but if she should live longer than fifteen years we would be completely taken in. people always live forever when there is an annuity to be paid them.}
<A>__{john gives the coins to the landlord.}
