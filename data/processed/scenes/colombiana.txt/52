<L>__{exterior fresno night}
<A>__{a sleepy california town on the way to nowhere.}
<B>__{pan down to}
<L>__{exterior side street night}
<A>__{a police cruiser sits on a quiet street, right off a wider avenue. main street. there is no traffic either way. the nose of the cop car juts out just off the street.}
<L>__{interior police cruiser night}
<A>__{two cops are sitting, peeling back the wrappers on their burgers.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{so then i suggest, y'know, we buy some things to spice it up a bit.}
<C>__{cop 2}
<D>__{define things.}
<A>__{as they nibble and talk, they pay scant attention to a set of headlights coming up the broad avenue.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{a garter belt, some of those stockings that come up the thigh...it's fourteen years. know what i mean?}
<A>__{the lights come closer...}
<C>__{cop 2}
<D>__{yeah. no matter how much you like steak, sometime a lamb chop is not a bad thing.}
<A>__{the lights shine right into the car.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{exactly.}
<A>__{only then, when the lights are directly on them, do the cops turn to see a car heading right toward their front end.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{what the...}
<A>__{crash!!!! the front end of the cop car gets sheared right off by the impact. glass shatters, metal crunches, airbags explode!}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{the other car. the drivers door opens. a vodka bottle falls out, clinks to the sidewalk. and a moment later, two legs emerge from the car. two very long, very shapely legs. legs that never end. in very high heels, and a very short mini skirt. and the face on top of it, framed by a mane of wild hair, is drop dead think you have died and gone to heaven gorgeous. the whole package reads supermodel. and by the way she is weaving when she stands, and the bottle at her feet, the read is; very drunk supermodel. who looks at the crumpled police cruiser, looks into the windshield of the cruiser at the stunned cops, and says in the most sweetly drunk voice...}
<C>__{supermodel}
<D>__{oops...}
<A>__{the cops can't believe this. they regain their wits and bolt out of the car.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{that's all you have to say? oops?}
<A>__{and, ever so sensually, she starts to laugh. the cops look at each other, perplexed. and she keeps laughing. the cops get pissed.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{funny?}
<A>__{...and she keeps laughing.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{wanna laugh you crazy bitch? i will give you something to laugh about!}
<A>__{and even when they slam her to the hood of the car, jam her hands behind her back, and slap the cuffs on, she keeps laughing, and laughing.}
<B>__{close on her chest where a very familiar medallion on a chain hangs between her exposed cleavage. a medallion engraved with the cataleya orchid.}
<A>__{it is cat, all grown up.}
