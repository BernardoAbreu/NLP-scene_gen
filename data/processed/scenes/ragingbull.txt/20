<L>__{interior webster hall night}
<A>__{a neighborhood dance is in progress. a small band is playing while mainly older couples dance. there are two priests present. the younger people are divided into two groups the boys, who are dressed in suits and ties, and spend most of their time at the bar area and the girls, who are in evening dresses, and spend most of their time dancing together. some of the more popular girls are surrounded by "wise guys." there are tables near the dance floor with "set ups" (bottles of scotch, rye, and a bucket of ice) on them. these tables are the "bases of operation" for different neighborhood groups, as if they were street corners. jake and joey are walking toward a table. vera, a young neighborhood girl, blocks their way as she bends over to talk to some guys at a table. vera's well built, and knows it. joey tries to move one way; vera again blocks his way. this little game goes on for a few seconds, then:}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{look, could you move a little. would you mind, darling?}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{mind what, mr. big shot?}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{eh, girlie, take a walk.}
<A>__{jake starts to move forward; joey stops him.}
<C>__{joey}
<P>__{(to vera)}
<D>__{all right, darling, i will just stand here and wait.}
<A>__{joey cups his hands and grabs vera's breasts. vera squeals, covers her breasts, and moves back. joey and jake walk past her. joey smiles. joey and jake sit down at an empty table.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{do you see her yet?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{give me a chance. let me look.}
<B>__{moving shots}
<A>__{jake tries to find her camera pans until we find her. joey points out a distant table. he spots vickie with a couple of other girls . vickie locks beautiful and is obviously having a good time.}
<C>__{joey }
<D>__{there she is over there on the other side. what did i tell you? oh, ain't she nice? ain't she a fuckin' doll?}
<A>__{as they watch, we see, from jake's pov: salvy, frankie, and junior show up at vickie's table. they are in overcoats and hats and don't sit down. they are obviously on their way to bigger things than a neighborhood dance and vickie and her girlfriends are glad to go with them. they get up to leave.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{be right back.}
<A>__{salvy, frankie, junior, vtckie and the other two girls leave the dance hall. jake, unseen, follows them to the entrance way, as they go out onto the sidewalk.}
