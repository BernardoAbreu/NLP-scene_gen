<L>__{interior matt's apt. night}
<A>__{the lighting soft and sweet. jeannie's words are tentative as she talks to her father who sits watching intently.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i don't know if i've been bad. i know somebody's been bad.}
<P>__{(hopefully)}
<D>__{...maybe it's you.}
<A>__{matt laughs. jeannie looks at him shyly... he looks at her with encouragement. suddenly she is in his arms, hugging him hard, an emotional dam seems to have broken.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{oh, i love you so much, i love you so much... i love you so much.}
<A>__{matt holds on clearly, deeply moved. then he exercises the effort to control his emotions and speaks, surprisingly, as a black woman.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(as black woman)}
<D>__{i hope that makes you feel a whole lot better, chile... 'cause it sure goes a long way to cure what ails me.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i can't believe i...}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(as himself, coaching)}
<D>__{...got in this much...}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{...got in this much trouble. .}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{right. over a...}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(guessing)}
<D>__{word?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yes. 'i can't believe i got in this much trouble over a word.' now do you know what she means when she says that?}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i don't want to talk about it just say her stuff so i know mine.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she starts to flail a bit.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it's your choice... but i'm not helping unless you try to understand as well as memorize. it will be fun. come on. i know it's hard...}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{okay. okay...}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{anything to shut me up, huh? okay, this little girl you're pretending to be... she can't be with her mommy either, just like you, or her father... she has to stay in rainbow house which is called that because...}
<P>__{(jeannie starts fidgeting)}
<D>__{jeannie...}
<P>__{(she stops)}
<D>__{...because everyone's a different color... so when this little girl calls the black lady who takes care of all the children this terrible word... it's like the worst thing anybody can do... come here.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(approaching him)}
<D>__{i don't want to do the 'i love you' again.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, i might have been working you too hard on that one.}
<A>__{she is unable to resist muttering one sarcastic shot.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{yeah. why don't you do that with poopie cathy?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(ignoring her)}
<D>__{now, did the director tell you how he wanted you to do it?}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{he said to smile all the time almost and to talk... uh...}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{faster?}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{okay. we don't always get good directors, so it's important for us...}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{me. you're not in the show.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i'm referring to the family of actors, you little shithead.}
<A>__{jeannie doesn't know quite how to take the name calling. music in... we're heading for a rendezvous with a dance as it continues across the cut to:}
