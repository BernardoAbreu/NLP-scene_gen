<A>__{we are in jittery, handheld thug's pov shot as they burst back in, barreling by rooms, looking in them, pressing on to more rooms... a man's shadowy shape ahead, in the kitchen thug #2 blasts his gun... the man crumples, the glass doors behind him explode...... the man goes down...revealing eddie standing behind him (he's been holding up his neighbor's body) and, just as this registers whack! eddie gives thug #1 a savage shot with a fireplace poker. thug #1 goes down, unconscious... the gun skitters across the floor... thug #2 dives, reaches for it. eddie grabs a piece of the shattered glass and, in a vicious swipe, brings it down on the thug's hand. but this guy is not a tough russian motherfucker for nothing. bleeding profusely, he doesn't let go of the gun... his bloody hand comes up, tries to aim... eddie dives backwards, through the broken glass door to the patio. the thug stumbles after him...}
