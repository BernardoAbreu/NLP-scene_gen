<T>__{fade out:}
<L>__{exterior trail day fade in: extreme long shot. west are the sierras and clouds are piled}
<A>__{in untidy heaps on the range. the dusty trail runs through rolling country. pinon pine and brush clothe the slopes. the wagon and horses are the moving center of a white cloud of dust.}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{clay's party. clay rides in the lead. the wagon follows and steve is riding beside the wagon. behind is the remuda, and the horses are straying off the road in search of grass.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{wagon (moving). featuring steve and mary. elaine lies under the seat and helen sits beside her. steve is reciting the alphabet to a simple melody usually sung by children of six or seven.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(stumbles embarrassedly)}
<D>__{gee, i can't.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{why not? you went farther than that last time.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i'm too old for it, miss wells... that's for little kids.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{don't be silly... nobody's too old to learn.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(resolutely)}
<D>__{okay. a b c d e f g h i }
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{clay. he turns in his saddle where he rides ahead of the team. he notices steve riding at mary's side and reins in his horse.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(mildly)}
<D>__{oh, steve!}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{steve and mary. steve stops his letters. looks off. the wagon moves up to clay and stops.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{get back to the horses. they're straggling.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{he's learning his letters.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{yeah. while the horses wander all over the country.}
<A>__{steve hesitates hoping he'll change his mind.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(sternly)}
<D>__{do like i said.}
<A>__{steve wheels his horse and rides back. mary looks over at clay.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(motioning)}
<D>__{are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(after a backward glance)}
<D>__{they're stragglin'.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{his letters will keep.}
<A>__{he wheels his horse and rides after steve.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{steve is driving the horses back into the road. clay rides up to help him. the horses fall in behind the wagon. steve takes up his position in the rear. clay rides over beside him.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{clay and steve. (moving)}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{steve i want you to learn to read. i meant to teach you but i never seemed to find time. i figured when we got settled on the ranch we'd get around to it.}
<A>__{they ride in silence for a moment.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it's all right with me if she teaches you, but i don't want you forgettin' your job.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(flat)}
<D>__{i won't again.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{one of the horses strays out of line and clay rides out and gets the animal back in the road. then he returns to steve. two shot (moving)}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{this isn't like other trips we've taken. for one thing, we've got a wagonload of women. for another there's a guy wanderin' around hopin' to put a bullet in my back.}
<A>__{steve looks over at his brother and finds a wry grin.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{okeh, i was wrong. but you can't expect a fellow who never saw lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. you've been sorta close mouthed about him.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i guess i have. you were pretty little when they locked him up. i don't suppose you even remember that time i was gone two months.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{sure i remember. you went to mexico lookin' for cattle.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(nods; then, after a moment)}
<D>__{you remember jeff rawson? we used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{sure i do. went off down to mexico or something...}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{that's what i told you then. only he didn't. lednov killed him.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{oh... that's the time you went away.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i caught up with lednov in nogales. he didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. i turned him over to the sheriff and that's the story.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(looking off)}
<D>__{maybe you shoulda killed him.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{maybe i should. but i was never much on killin'. anyway, he moved too quick and i just got him through the shoulder.}
<P>__{(glances off)}
<D>__{looks pretty peaceful up ahead.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{yeah, it does.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{but you never can tell. why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?}
<A>__{steve smiles warmly at him.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{and while you're there you might as well find out what comes after k.}
