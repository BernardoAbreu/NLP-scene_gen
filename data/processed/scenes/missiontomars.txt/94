<A>__{too late! in slow motion, we see a terrifyingly violent chain reaction. the fuel tanks themselves explode, one after another. the supporting metal struts are vaporized. the solar panels are snapped off. two of the huge engine bells are smashed sideways, out of alignment, while the third, trailing pieces of the cowling, goes hurtling off, past camera, like a flaming cannon ball. the entire aft section of the ship, including much of the lower hab, instantly becomes a shredded, charred tangle of metal, and even worse, the explosion causes what's left of the ship mainly the eva chamber and cockpit to tumble end over end, cartwheeling down towards mars.}
