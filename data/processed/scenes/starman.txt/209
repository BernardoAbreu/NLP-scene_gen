<L>__{interior drug store late afternoon}
<A>__{the star man hangs back to examine a one armed bandit inside the front door while jenny goes to the counter. an almost imperceptible blue haze seems to seep from under the star man's palms as he runs his hands up and down the sides of the machine.}
<C>__{jenny }
<P>__{(to the clerk)}
<D>__{do you have a good map of death valley?}
<C>__{clerk }
<D>__{we should have. let me see.}
<A>__{while the clerk searches for the map the star man comes up to jenny.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{may i have twenty five cents, please?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i want to gamble.}
<A>__{jenny sighs and rolls her eyes and fishes two quarters out of her purse and hands them to him.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{here are two quarters. when you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i understand.}
<P>__{(heading back to the machine)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he drops a quarter into the slot and pulls the handle. while the pictures of fruit spin behind the view window, his hands stroke the sides of the machine. an orange, a pear and a cherry stop in the view window. at the counter jenny explains to the clerk that she is hitchhiking and wants the busiest route into death valley without going through lathrop wells. the star man looks long and hard at the machine before putting in his last quarter. he pulls the handle. the blue haze flows from his palms, three cherries lock into a line and the one armed bandit begins to spit quarters.}
