<L>__{exterior countryside night (b & w)}
<A>__{lightning splits the black and white sky, revealing a single shattered oak in a desolate landscape. below, a human silhouette stumbles through the darkness, the top of his head flat, his arms long and heavy, his boots weighted with mud. suddenly the storm fades. light creeps into the scene, and color, as we dissolve to:}
<B>__{the pacific ocean}
<A>__{melting into a hazy morning sky. in a box canyon off the coast highway, we see row after neat row of trailer homes, a makeshift village for beach bums.}
<L>__{interior trailer day}
<A>__{clayton boone opens his eyes. he is 26, handsome in a rough hewn, chet baker like way, with broad shoulders and a flattop haircut. he grabs a crumpled pack of lucky strikes, lights a bent cigarette. clay stands and walks bare assed across the single tin room, his head almost touching the ceiling.}
<L>__{exterior trailer park day}
<A>__{clay goes a few rounds with a weatherstained speed bag that's set up behind his trailer.}
<L>__{interior trailer day}
<A>__{clay towels off, glances at the morning paper. he moves aside a pile of paperbacks on a card table until he finds a calendar. his finger targets today's first appointment. "10 a.m. 788 amalfi drive."}
<L>__{exterior trailer park day}
<A>__{clay steps out of the trailer, clean shaven and dressed in dungarees, a t shirt with a fresh pack of cigarettes flipped into one sleeve. he weight lifts a secondhand mower onto the bed of his rusty pick up. clay climbs into the truck, slides the key into the ignition. it takes a few tries but the engine finally turns over.}

<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{she was nothing but bother. i not like her, mr. jimmy not like her. we do better if you live in again, mr. david.}
<A>__{in the dining room, visible through open double doors, david lewis, 55, speaks softly with the housekeeper, hanna. she is a squat, muffin faced hungarian woman in her late 50s, dressed in black, her hair cinched in a tight bun. she speaks with a thick accent.}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{she tells me you haven't been sleeping well.}
<C>__{whale}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{then take the pills.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i wanted to be alert for your visit today. especially since i saw so little of you in the hospital.}

<C>__{whale}
<D>__{"the fault, dear david, is not in ourselves but in our stars."}

<P>__{(too anxious to laugh)}
<D>__{you remember how a production eats up one's life.}

<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{goodbye, hanna.}
<A>__{hanna runs out of the kitchen to escort david to the door. whale drifts back to the window, watches as clay revs up the lawnmower, creating a cloud of white smoke. we cut to:}
<L>__{exterior streets of dudley day (1900)}
<A>__{a bean pole child with flaming red hair (whale at age 12) stares up at the coal smoke pouring from a seemingly endless row of chimneys. we're in dudley, a factory town in the english midlands region known as the black country.}

<D>__{stop lagging behind, jimmy. we'll be late for church.}

<C>__{william whale}
<D>__{straighten up, son.}
<A>__{young whale's movements thicken into a dim imitation of manly reserve. the whale family marches up a steeply mounting street to dixon's green methodist church.}
<L>__{interior whale's house living room day}
<A>__{whale's eyes tighten. he focuses on clay boone as he peels off his t shirt, revealing a tattoo on his upper right forearm.}

<D>__{bone? boom? something bee. i hire him while you were in the hospital. he came cheap.}

<D>__{i couldn't help but notice your tattoo. that phrase? death before dishonor. what does it mean?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{just that i was in the marines.}

<D>__{getting to be a warm day. a scorcher, as you yanks call it.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{yeah. i better get on with my work.}
<A>__{whale clears his throat behind the back of his hand.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{when you're through, mr. boone, feel free to make use of the pool. we're quite informal here. you don't have to worry about a suit.}
<A>__{clay glances warily at whale.}

<D>__{no thanks. i got another job to get to this afternoon.}
<A>__{whale holds clay's look.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{some other time, perhaps? keep up the fine work.}

<L>__{interior whale house dudley night (1908)}
<A>__{a rough pencil outline of the same painting. whale, age 16, sits on his bed, ignoring the roughhousing of the three younger brothers who share the room. the door opens and whale's mother sarah enters.}

<D>__{jimmy. the privy needs cleaning.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i have my class tonight.}
<A>__{both have midlands accents, like head colds that flatten their speech. whale holds up the sketch to show his mother.}
<C>__{sarah whale}
<D>__{don't get above yarself, jimmy. leave the drawring to the artists.}
<A>__{whale squeezes the pad behind the bed, jumps up.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{quite so, mum. to the privy.}
<A>__{and he heads cheerfully out of the room. his mother shakes her head.}
<C>__{sarah whale}
<D>__{"quite so."}

<D>__{don't be daft. it's just a student from the university.}
<A>__{the doorbell rings.}
<L>__{interior whale's house living room day}
<A>__{whale settles into his club chair and opens a book, pretending to read until hanna ushers in the visitor.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{mr. kay, sir.}
<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(feigning surprise)}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{whale looks up at edmund kay, 22, a slim boy who rests his weight on one slouched hip, his arms twined behind him. there is a look of mild disappointment on whale's face as he realizes that kay is a baby poof.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{ah, mr. kay. i'd almost forgotten. my guest for tea.}
<A>__{whale stands and holds out his hand.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{mr. whale, this is such an honor. you're one of my favorite all time directors. i can't believe i'm meeting you.}
<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(gently, teasing)}
<D>__{no. i expect you can't.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{and this is your house. wow. the house of frankenstein.}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{i thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{one likes to live simply.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i know. people's movies aren't their lives.}
<A>__{he suddenly growls out an imitation of boris karloff.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{love dead. hate living.}
<A>__{kay laughs, a high, girlish giggle. whale fights a cringe with a polite smile.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{that's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours. "bride of frankenstein."}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{is it now? hanna? i think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.}
<A>__{it's clear from hanna's frown that she doesn't approve of the idea. whale ignores her, turns back to kay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{will that be good for you, mr. kay?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(opens the back door)}
<D>__{after you then.}
<A>__{whale inspects the boy from behind, noticing his wide hips and plumpish posterior.}
<L>__{exterior whale's house backyard day}
<A>__{kay's hands flap animatedly as whale leads him down to the pool.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i love the great horror films. and yours are the best. "the old dark house." "the invisible man." they look great and have style. and funny!}
<A>__{whale points to a small shingled house near the pool.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{this is the studio where i painterior}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{nice.}
<P>__{(refusing to be sidetracked)}
<D>__{and your lighting and camera angles. you're got to go back to german silent movies to find anything like it.}
<L>__{exterior whale's house upper patio day}
<A>__{clay boone gulps some water from the garden hose. he glances down at the pool, where kay and whale sit in cast iron chairs.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{time for you to leave.}
<A>__{clay turns to hanna, who holds a tray loaded with finger sandwiches and a pitcher of iced tea.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm on my way.}
<A>__{she doesn't move until clay starts off.}
<L>__{exterior whale's house poolside day}
<A>__{kay flips open his steno pad.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{so, mr. kay? what do you want to know?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{everything. start at the beginning.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i was born outside london, the only son of a minister who was a master at harrow. grandfather was a bishop. church of...church of eng...}
<A>__{whale's tongue trips on the word, his voice suddenly drowned out by the blast of a factory whistle. we cut to:}
<L>__{interior factory shop floor dudley day (1908)}
<A>__{fiery melt is poured into molds on the shop floor of a machine parts factory. whale, 16, grips the hot casting with tongs. his father william, his face blackened with grime, hammers away at the flaws. a heavy blow causes young whale to drop the mold, prompting catcalls and sneers on the floor. there is a look of genuine fear in whale's eyes as he looks up at his singed, beast like father. we cut to:}
<L>__{exterior whale's house backyard day}
<A>__{kay clears his throat softly.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{mr. whale?}
<A>__{whale smiles politely to cover his momentary disorientation.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{your father was a schoolmaster?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{of course. i attended eton it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught. i was to go up to oxford but the war broke out and i never made it. the great war, you know. you had a good war, but we had a great one.}
<A>__{he glances to see if the boy smiles at the quip.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you can't imagine what life was like after the armistice. the twenties in london were one long bank holiday, a break from everything dour and respectable. i had a knack with pencil and paper, so i was hired to design sets for stage productions.}
<A>__{hanna comes down the path with the tray. she places it on the table.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{thank you, hanna. very nice.}
<A>__{hanna remains planted next to the table.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you can go now.}
<A>__{she makes an audible sigh and starts back up the hill.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{there was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "journey's end". every experienced director turned it down, so i offered myself, bullying and begging for the job. "journey's end" made the careers of everyone associated with it. it was only a matter of time until hollywood beckoned.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{how much longer before we get to "frankenstein"?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{am i correct in assuming, mr. kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{oh no, i want to hear everything. you made twenty pictures in all }
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{twenty one. the romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking. the horror pictures were trifles. grand guignol for the masses.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{but it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.}
<A>__{an abrupt look of anger flashes across whale's face.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i am not dead yet, mr. kay.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{no. i never said you were. or will be soon.}
<A>__{kay leans over the steno pad, determined to be more worthy.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{so. "journey's end" brought you to hollywood }
<A>__{whale takes in the boy's blank, bored expression. he sighs.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i have a proposal, mr. kay. this mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i don't mind.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{let's make it more interesting. i will answer any question you ask. but, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.}
<A>__{kay's mouth pops open.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{that's funny, mr. whale.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{it is, isn't it? my life as a game of strip poker. shall we play?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{you're serious.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{quite.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{then the rumors are true?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what rumors might those be?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{that you were forced to retire because, uh a sex scandal.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{a homosexual scandal, you mean? for me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.}
<A>__{kay just sits there, squinting and grinning.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{you're a dirty old man.}
<A>__{whale tilts his head as if brushing off a compliment. kay kicks off his penny loafers, bends over to remove his socks.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you are kind to indulge your elders in their vices. as i indulge the young in theirs.}
<A>__{two pale feet emerge. whale leans forward to examine them. he leans back again.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no. there was no scandal.}
<A>__{and he reaches into his coat for a cigar. whale's hand trembles as he slices a hole at the base, then lights the cigar with a wooden match, sucking and rotating until the tip is roundly lit.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{my only other vice. i suppose you'd like a fuller answer to your question.}
<A>__{kay nods.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{it will cost you your sweater.}
<A>__{kay hesitates a moment, then sets his pen aside to pull the sweater over his head, revealing a sleeveless t shirt.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{too warm for a sweater, anyway.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you must understand how hollywood was twenty years ago. nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers. outside of hollywood, who knows who george cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along santa monica?}
<A>__{kay stares at him in disbelief.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{george cukor? who made "a star is born"? i never guessed.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{take off your vest and i will tell you a story.}
<A>__{kay plucks at his t shirt, glancing toward the house.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{don't be shy. there's time to stop before you go too far.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i guess.}
<A>__{kay peels off the shirt and tosses it on his shoes and sweater.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{george is famous for his saturday dinner parties. great artists, writers, society folk, all rubbing elbows with hollywood royalty. but how many of those oh so proper people know about the sunday brunches that follow? gatherings of trade eating leftovers, followed by some strenuous fun and frolic in the pool.}
<P>__{(flicks an ash)}
<D>__{if a goat like that can continue about his business, my more domestic arrangements could've raised very few eyebrows.}
<A>__{the revelation seems to have left kay a little shaken. he flips to a blank page.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{can we talk about the horror movies now?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{certainly, mr. kay. is there anything in particular you want to know?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{will you tell me everything you remember about making "frankenstein"?}
<A>__{he glances down at his few remaining articles of clothing.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{can that count as one question?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i can't believe i'm doing this.}
<A>__{kay stands to unbuckle his belt, glancing around the yard again. he unzips and steps out of his sharply creased flannel legs. his thighs are thin and pale.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{just like going swimming, isn't it?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{maybe you'd like a swim when we're through. i never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{okay. "frankenstein." tell me everything.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{righto. let me see.}
<A>__{whale swallows a wince, trying to block the pain pushing against his skull.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly i mean badly, not baldly. i was given the pick of stories being developed, and i picked that one.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{who came up with the monster's makeup and look?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{my idea. muchly. my sketches. big heavy brow. head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{he's one of the great images of the twentieth century. as important as the mona lisa.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you think so? that's very kind }
<A>__{whale clutches at the air, suddenly notices that his hand is empty. he looks down and sees the cigar on the flagstones.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{boris karloff. where did you find him?}
<A>__{whale bends down to retrieve his cigar and the change of gravity drives a spike through his skull.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{karloff, mr. whale. how did you cast him?}
<A>__{whale turns toward the froggy voice.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{please. excuse me. i must go lie }
<A>__{he forces himself up with one hand. kay finally looks up, notices whale's colorless lips and desperate eyes.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{mr. whale? are you all right?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i just need to lie down. studio. daybed in studio.}
<A>__{whale lurches from the table. kay jumps forward, catching him under an arm.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{oh my god. what's wrong, mr. whale? is it your heart?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{head. not heart.}
<A>__{he leans against kay, who leads him toward the studio.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{forgive me.}

<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{water. glasses at the sink.}
<A>__{she goes to whale, scooping different bottles from the pocket of her apron.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{which ones? i bring them all.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{luminal.}
<A>__{she empties a pill into her palm. whale places it into his mouth and takes the glass of water kay passes over hanna's shoulder. whale swallows the pill, then glances up at kay, feigning surprise.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{mr. kay. you're not dressed.}
<A>__{kay frantically crosses his arms over his chest and middle, turns to hanna.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i was going to take a swim.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i'm sorry i spoiled it for you. you should probably go home.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{kay hurries outside to retrieve his clothes. hanna undoes whale's bow tie. she makes no attempt to be gentle.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you must think i'm terrible, hanna.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{i do not think you anything anymore. just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh shut up. all we did was talk. my attack had nothing to do with him.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no. let me lie here. thank you.}
<A>__{hanna nods, moves to the door. whale closes his eyes, breathes deeply, trying to block the throbbing sound in his brain. we cut to:}
<L>__{interior factory shop floor dudley day (1908)}
<A>__{the noise is deafening the clank of chains, the screech of wheels and the endless banging of hammers. william whale continues to knock away at the hot casting. the rhythmic sound blends into the insistent knocking of:}

<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{my name is daisy.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{time to go, daisy.}
<A>__{she presses her naked body against clay's.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{you know. i could help you fix up this place real nice.}
<A>__{clay takes a deep breath, trying to clear the gumminess from his brain.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{don't you have to be somewhere? like high school maybe.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{i gave it up for lent.}

<D>__{right.}

<L>__{interior whale's house studio day}
<A>__{whale ponders the half painted canvas, clearly distressed by his lack of progress. the stillness is punctured by the sound of clay's lawnmower being dragged up the brick steps. whale smiles, puts down his brush.}
<L>__{exterior whale's house backyard day}
<A>__{clay stops, turns around, feeling someone's eyes watching him.}
<C>__{whale }
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{the bells of hell go ting a ling...}
<A>__{the mower slips out of clay's hands momentarily. he looks around, spots whale inside the studio.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{everything alright, mr. boone?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{just got away from me. sorry to disturb you.}
<A>__{the screen door squeaks open, clatters shut. a leather slipper and rubber tipped cane appear. whale strolls into view, smiling.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i was just about to ask hanna to bring down iced tea. i'd like it very much if you'd join me.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i stink to high heaven right now.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{the honest sweat of one's brow. i assure you i won't be offended. let me tell hanna to bring tea for two.}
<A>__{whale's cane trembles in his skeletal hand. his frailty chips away at clay's resolve.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{or would you prefer a beer?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no. iced tea's fine.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{splendid.}
<A>__{clay hoses the crumbs of grass off his arms. he dries his hands and arms with his hat, then wads it up and stuffs it into his shirt to wipe out his armpits.}
<L>__{interior whale's house studio day}
<A>__{clay stands at the screen door.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{come in, mr. boone.}
<A>__{whale sits on a daybed, next to a pile of newspapers. he gestures at a wooden armchair across from him.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{my workshop, my studio. hardly somewhere in which a sweaty workman should feel out of place.}
<A>__{clay glances at the unframed canvases on the wall and stacked in the corners.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{these are your paintings?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what? oh yes.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{excuse me, but are you famous?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you know what they say. if you have to ask }
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm just a hick who cuts lawns. but some of these look familiar.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{they were familiar when i painted them. that one's copied from a dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago. and that's a rembrandt.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{they're just copies then. gotcha.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but before i retired, you might say i had a brief time in the sun. fame, as it were. tell me, do you like motion pictures?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{sure, everybody does. when i was a kid i'd go with my sister twice a week. why? were you an actor or something?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{in my youth, yes, but never in hollywood. no, i was merely a director here.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{yeah? what were some of your movies?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{this and that. the only ones you maybe have heard of are the "frankenstein" pictures.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{clay sits up, surprised, skeptical and impressed all at once.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{"frankenstein" and "bride of" and "son of" and all the rest?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i made only the first two. the others were done by hacks.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{still. you must be rich. making a couple of famous movies like those.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{merely comfortable. here's hanna with our refreshments. can you get the door?}
<A>__{clay jumps up to open the screen door. hanna walks past, refusing to look at him. she sets the tray on a table very hard, ringing the glasses and silverware.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{how are you feeling, mr. jimmy? how is your mind today?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{my mind's lovely. and yours?}
<A>__{hanna flares her nostrils at him.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{you remember what the doctor tells us.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes, yes, yes. i merely invited mr. boone in for a glass of tea. we'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{i am not forgetting your last brief chat.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{just go. we can manage without you.}
<A>__{hanna stares up at clay.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{he looks plenty big. you won't need my help if anything goes flooey.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{go.}
<A>__{she shakes her head and marches out the door. clay returns to his chair and sits down again.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{when they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.}
<P>__{(smiles at clay)}
<D>__{please, mr. boone. help yourself.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what did she mean by going flooey?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i returned recently from a stay in hospital.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what was wrong?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{nothing serious. a touch of stroke.}
<A>__{clay nods, chugs his tea. when he lowers the glass, he finds the old man watching him.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you must excuse me for staring, mr. boone. but you have a marvelous head.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{to an artistic eye, you understand. have you ever modeled?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you mean, like posed for pictures?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{sat for an artist. been sketched.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(with a laugh)}
<D>__{what's to sketch?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you have the most architectural skull. and your nose. very expressive.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{broke is more like it.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but expressively broken. how did it happen?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{football in college.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you went to university?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{just a year. i dropped out to join the marines.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes. you were a marine.}
<A>__{whale's gaze deepens. he laughs lightly.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i apologize for going on like this. it's the sunday painter in me. of course i can understand your refusal. it's a great deal to ask of someone.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you mean you really want to draw me?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{indeed. i'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{but why?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{and it's just my head you want? nothing else?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what are you suggesting? you'll charge extra if i include a hand or a bit of shoulder.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i have no interest in your body, mr. boone. i can assure you of that.}
<A>__{clay takes a moment to size up whale whose innocent, slightly befuddled smile makes him appear about as threatening as a box of cornflakes.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{all right then. sure. i could use the extra dough.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{excellent. we'll have a most interesting time.}
<A>__{whale lifts his glass, takes a small sip of tea.}
<L>__{exterior whale's house day}
<A>__{clay fetches a pair of hedge clippers from his truck. he can't help stopping by the side view mirror to look at his face.}
<L>__{interior examination room day}
<A>__{doctors and technicians flash lights into whale's eyes... test his reflexes...inject him with radioactive isotope. whale sits very still with his head behind a fluoroscope screen while two doctors murmur over the image.}
<L>__{interior doctor's office day}
<A>__{a pair of x rays are slapped wet on a light board. two skulls, one facing forward, the other in profile. dr. payne, a bland young neurologist, points to a smudge in the side view x ray.}
<C>__{dr. payne}
<D>__{this is the area of infarction. by which we mean the portion of brain affected by the stroke.}
<A>__{the venetian blinds of the examining room are closed. whale sits calmly, flanneled legs crossed at the knees, gazing at his own skull.}
<C>__{dr. payne}
<D>__{you're a lucky man, mr. whale. whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes, yes, dr. payne. but from the neck up? what's my story there?}
<C>__{dr. payne}
<D>__{that's what i'm trying to explain.}
<A>__{payne turns off the light board and goes to the venetian blinds. the room is instantly full of sun.}
<C>__{dr. payne}
<D>__{the central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations. whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short circuited this mechanism. parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?}
<C>__{dr. payne}
<D>__{that's as good a way as any to describe it. i've seen far worse cases. you might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but the rest of it? the killing headaches. the phantom smells. my inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. it's all nothing more than bad electricity?}
<C>__{dr. payne}
<D>__{in a manner of speaking. i've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but i'm sure they're related.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{so what do i do?}
<C>__{dr. payne}
<D>__{take the luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until i'm better. that my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.}
<A>__{the doctor responds with a sympathetic gaze. whale nods solemnly.}
<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{whale makes his way toward the stairs. he passes a stoop shouldered elderly woman who leans on the arm of her middle aged daughter. then an old man in a wheelchair, his eyes brimming with bewilderment and despair.}
<L>__{interior whale's house foyer day}
<A>__{hanna opens the door. clay wears dungarees and a white dress shirt.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{don't worry, you already paid me. i'm here because }
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{the master is waiting for you.}
<A>__{she gestures him in, shuts the door.}
<L>__{interior whale's house kitchen day}
<A>__{clay follows hanna into the kitchen.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{he's down in his studio. here. take this with you.}
<A>__{she thrusts a tv tray toward him. two glasses, two bottles of beer, a bottle of coke.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it's your job, lady, not mine.}
<P>__{(hands back the tray)}
<D>__{i'm here so he can draw my picture.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{i'm keeping away. what you are doing is no business of mine.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what're you talking about?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{what kind of man are you? are you a good man?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{yeah, i'm a good man. something make you think i'm not?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{you will not hurt him?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{gimme a break. i'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures. is that going to hurt him?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{no. no.}
<P>__{(closes her eyes)}
<D>__{i am sorry. forget everything i say. here. i will take the tray.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you do that.}
<L>__{interior whale's house studio day}
<A>__{clay opens the squeaking door and enters behind hanna. whale stands at a drafting table, sharpening a pencil. hanna sets the tray down.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{very good, hanna. now goodbye.}
<A>__{she goes toward the door, wrinkling her forehead at clay. the screen door bangs shut.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i'm sure you'd like something to wet your whistle while i work.}
<A>__{whale opens a bottle of beer, pours it into a glass, hands it to clay. he gestures to a chair.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{we'll go slowly today. since this is your first time as a model.}
<A>__{clay sits. he pulls a "tv guide" out of his back pocket.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{did you see this? they're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you don't say? which picture?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{"bride of frankenstein."}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{hmmm. i much prefer "show boat" or "the invisible man." shall we begin?}
<A>__{clay takes a swig of beer and sets the glass on the floor.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{ready when you are.}
<A>__{whale stares at clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{that shirt, mr. boone.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it's new.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's too white, too distracting. would it be asking too much for you to take it off?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm not wearing an undershirt.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{pish posh, mr. boone. i'm not your aunt tilly.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{but it's just my face you want to draw.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.}
<A>__{he lifts a drop cloth off a footlocker, revealing a stack of "physique" magazines. whale casually covers them with a newspaper.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{we could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders. would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{all right already. i will take it off. kind of warm in here anyway.}
<A>__{he unbuttons the shirt and pulls it off.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes. much better.}
<P>__{(steps forward)}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{clay adjusts his belt buckle as whale hangs the shirt on a wall peg. he moves back to the easel again.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i think we'll have you sit slightly sideways, so you can rest one arm on the back of the chair. yes. just so.}
<A>__{the arm with the tattoo faces the easel. clay smirks.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{take a picture, it lasts longer.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{that's exactly what i intend to do.}
<A>__{a clatter of pencils in the easel's tray, followed by a moment of silence. finally, a low, whistly scratch. clay concentrates on keeping still, focusing on an open window.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you seem to have no idea how handsome you are, mr. boone. it has to do with how snugly your face fits your skull.}
<A>__{clay wipes a thin line of sweat from his waist.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{would you be more comfortable barefoot? feel free to remove your boots and socks.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no. i'm fine.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{it's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it? you have to remain perfectly still while i examine and scrutinize you.}
<A>__{whale suddenly sniffs, as if smelling something. he sniffs several times more but continues to draw.}
<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{dripping?}
<P>__{(to clay)}
<D>__{do you ever eat dripping in this country? the fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars. used like butter on bread.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{sounds like something you feed the dog.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{it is. only the poorest families ever ate it. we kept ours in a crockery jar.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{your family ate dripping?}
<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(catching himself)}
<D>__{of course not. as i said, only poor people }
<A>__{whale stops. he lets out a bitter laugh.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i've spent most of my life outrunning my past. now it's flooding all over me.}
<A>__{clay stares out blankly.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{there's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth. yes, my family ate dripping. beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley. are you also from the slums, mr. boone?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{we weren't rich. but we weren't poor either.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no, you were middle class, like all americans.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{in dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any american can imagine. every englishman knows his place. and if you forget, there's always someone to remind you. my family had no doubts about who they were. but i was an aberration in that household a freak of nature. i had imagination, cleverness, joy. where did i get that? certainly not from them.}
<A>__{whale's voice has changed, becoming more pinched and nasal.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{they took me out of school when i was fourteen and put me in a factory. they meant no harm. they were like a family of farmers who've been given a giraffe, and don't know what to do with the creature except harness him to the plow.}
<A>__{whale seems completely lost in the past by now.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{hatred was the only thing that kept my soul alive in that soul killing place. and among those men i hated was my own poor, dumb father. who put me in that hell to begin with.}
<A>__{whale peers out from behind the square of paper. he pales when he sees his father william, his face covered with grime, glaring at him from across the room. whale retreats behind the pad, takes a breath.}
<C>__{clay }
<D>__{mr. whale?}
<A>__{relief floods whale's face. he looks out, smiles at clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you have to excuse me, mr. boone. since my stroke, i am often overcome with nostalgia.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i don't mind. i'm not crazy about my old man either.}
<A>__{whale rubs a hand across his eyes and steps into the open.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{why don't we break for five minutes? you probably want to stretch your legs.}
<A>__{whale pulls the cover sheet over the pad to hide what he's drawn so far.}
<C>__{dwight }
<D>__{so you just sat there while this old limey banged his gums?}
<L>__{interior harry's beachcomber night}
<A>__{the place is dead. there's only clay and dwight sitting at the bar with the owner, harry, a balding hep cat with a scraggly tuft of beard. and, in a booth, kid saylor, a cocky 20 year old, necking with a pony tailed teenager.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i liked it. you learn stuff listening to old timers.}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(to harry)}
<D>__{you ever hear of this whale fellow?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{can't say that i have. can't say i've heard of a lot of people though.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{if you don't believe me, let's watch this movie. see if his name's on it. how about it, harry? can i watch my damn movie?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i told you. i don't turn on the tv except for the fights.}
<A>__{betty cartwright appears behind the bar, lugging a bucket of ice from the storeroom. she's an attractive woman in her early 30s, big boned and almost as tall as clay.}

<D>__{a spooky movie. just what this place needs tonight.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{couldn't make it any deader, doll. set me up.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{sure. your friend want one?}
<A>__{clay reacts to the silent treatment with a tight smile.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{yeah, one for what's his name here.}

<C>__{clay}
<D>__{thanks, doll.}

<P>__{(to harry)}

<D>__{why is everybody giving me crap tonight?}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{jesus, boone. you come in here proud as a peacock because some old coot wants to paint your picture. we're just bringing you back to earth.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{sounds screwy to me. i can't imagine a real artist wanting to spend time looking at that kisser.}
<C>__{clay}

<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{ooooh.}
<A>__{betty glares at clay, who realizes he's gone too far.}
<C>__{betty}

<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{ooooh.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what makes you say that?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{just thinking out loud.}

<D>__{yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{all right, then. he's interested in you for your conversation. we know what a great talker you are.}

<D>__{calm down, clay. just calm down. we'll watch it.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{good. fine.}
<A>__{harry reaches up, turns on a battered motorola. on the tv, a voice announces: "tonight, boris karloff in 'the bride of frankenstein.'" the titles come on. ending with the phrase "directed by", which floats over a white blob. the blob jumps forward to form letters: "james whale."}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{right there. what did i tell you? james whale.}
<A>__{the movie starts. the monster being roasted alive in the flaming wreckage of a mill.}
<C>__{betty}

<C>__{clay}
<D>__{go wash glasses if you don't like it.}
<A>__{in a flooded crater under the mill, the monster kills an old man. he climbs up, flips the man's wife into the pit below. an owl blinks impassively.}

<D>__{wonderful old una. gobbling like an old turkey hen.}

<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes. i trust you.}
<A>__{off in the distance, a throat loudly trumpets itself clear.}

<D>__{you must go in. quickly. he will not like to think i have had you in the kitchen.}

<A>__{whale comes forward as clay enters, offering a hand at the end of a spindly wrist.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{how are you, mr. boone? so glad you are free for lunch.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{all right, i guess.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.}
<A>__{a hesitant smile from clay. whale picks a stack of mail off the table, rifles through envelopes.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{forgive my rudeness. at my age, the post is the cream of the day.}
<A>__{he returns the stack to the table but holds on to a square envelope.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{do you mind?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{clay looks off while whale opens the envelope.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{hmmm? princess margaret?}
<A>__{he is examining a folded card. he rubs a thumb over the printed lettering.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{her majesty's loyal subjects in the motion picture industry... cordially invited...reception at the home of...mr. george cukor!}
<A>__{his lips smack open in disgust.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{that pushy little horning in on the queen's sister, then offering to share her with the whole damn raj? i live in this country to get away from this rubbish!}
<A>__{he tosses the invitation on the table.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{is this david's doing?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{this david's a friend?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes. an old, useless friend. you must excuse me, mr. boone. this is a world i finished with long ago. i pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment.}
<P>__{(a deep breath)}
<D>__{lunch should be ready. shall we?}
<A>__{he holds out an open hand so that clay can precede him into the dining room.}
<L>__{interior whale's house dining room day}

<C>__{whale}
<D>__{cheers.}
<A>__{they both take a sip of wine.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{smells lovely, hanna.}
<A>__{hanna nods, steals a glance at clay as she leaves.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{saw your movie the other night. watched it with some friends.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{did you now?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i liked it. we all did.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{did anyone laugh?}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(covering)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{pity. people are so earnest nowadays.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{why? was it supposed to be funny?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{of course. i had to make it interesting for myself, you see. a comedy about death. the trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.}
<P>__{(a sip of wine)}
<D>__{but the monster never receives any of my gibes. he is noble. noble and misunderstood.}
<A>__{whale gazes pointedly at clay, who eats with his elbows on the table, quickly bolting the hot omelette.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{in korea, mr. boone?}
<A>__{clay looks up.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{did you kill anyone?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i don't like to talk about that.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{it's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. that's something to be proud of.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{proud? any jerk with a gun can kill someone.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{quite true. hand to hand combat is the true test. did you ever slay anyone hand to hand?}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{no. i could have, though.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes, i believe you could.}
<P>__{(a sip of wine)}
<D>__{how free is your schedule this afternoon?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{full up. i got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by la cienega.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what is we say phooey to the hedges? could you spare an hour after lunch? to sit for me?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{can't today.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i will pay our going rate. plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{sorry. i don't feel like sitting still today.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{all righty. i understand.}
<A>__{whale tilts a scrutinizing eye at clay.}
<L>__{interior whale's house pantry day (later)}
<A>__{hanna carries the dirty dishes back to the kitchen.}
<L>__{interior whale's house dining room day}
<A>__{clay starts to bite the tip off a cigar.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{use this.}
<A>__{whale passes him a gold penknife.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{just a trim. and mine while you're at it. fingers are a bit stiff today.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you ever been married, mr. whale?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no. at least not in the legal sense.}
<A>__{clay hands a clipped cigar back to whale.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{so you had a wife?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{or a husband. depending on which of us you asked. my friend david. he lived here for many years.}
<A>__{the other cigar crunches faintly between clay's fingers.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{does that surprise you?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no, i you're a homosexual.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh dear. if one must have a clinical name.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm not, you know.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i never thought you were.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you don't think of me that way, do you?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what way might that be?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you know. look at me like like i look at women.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{don't be ridiculous. i know a real man like you would break my neck if i so much as laid a hand on him. besides, you're not my type.}
<A>__{clay suddenly laughs. whale's smile deepens.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{so we understand each other?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what you do is no business of mine. live and let live, i say.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no. i }
<A>__{whale continues to smile, slyly.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what are you afraid of, mr. boone? certainly not a frail old man like me.}
<A>__{clay has no answer. he gives in with a sigh.}
<L>__{interior whale's house studio day}
<A>__{clay sits sideways on the chair again. whale stands at the easel.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{can i see what you did so far?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{it will only make you self conscious. you'll have to remove your shirt.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{sorry. not today.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but we have to match the other sketch.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i just feel more comfortable keeping it on. you just said you didn't want me self conscious.}
<A>__{whale steps forward.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{perhaps if we open the shirt and pull }
<A>__{whale's hands to in. clay's flesh tightens; he shrinks back. the hands stop, palms raised.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh dear. i have made you nervous.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm fine. i'd just rather keep it on.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? two buttons. is that so much to ask? just two little buttons.}
<A>__{whale's thumb and fingers unpluck buttons in midair.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no! look. what you told me at lunch is still very weird for me. so either you sketch me like i am or i will say forget it and go do your hedges.}
<A>__{whale takes a step back. his eyes are locked on clay, fascinated by his temper.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i don't mean to be a prick, but that's how i feel.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{of course. i don't want to scare you off. not before i'm finished with you.}
<A>__{whale glides behind the easel. the pencils rattle in the tray.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{tell me more about yourself, mr. boone. you have a steady companion?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{not at the moment.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you know how it is. you have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{very well put.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{the world is just one kiss ass game after another. a man has to make up his own life, alone.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{ah. a philosopher.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{thoreau with a lawnmower.}
<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i like that. but take care, mr. boone. freedom is a drug, much like any other. too much can be a very bad thing.}
<A>__{clay glances out the window. feigning a merely casual interest:}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{is that why you and your friend split up? because you wanted to be free?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{in a way, yes. i suppose so. i know it's why i stopped making pictures.}
<A>__{whale backs away from the easel and stares at the paper with a sour frown.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when i was at the very pinnacle of my profession. the horror movies were behind me. i'd done "show boat." major success. great box office. now i was to do something important. "the road back." an indictment of the great war and what it did to germany. it was to be my masterpiece.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{the fucking studio butchered it. it was 1937, hitler's armies were already massing and still the new york bankers stood in line to curry his favor. anything to avoid losing the german market. they cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. the picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb. for which i was blamed.}
<A>__{a shadow passes over whale's eyes. he presses two fingers against his temple.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{after that, i went out of fashion. i was no longer able to command the best projects, so i walked away. why should i spend my time working in such a dreadful business?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{do you miss it?}
<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(dismissive)}
<D>__{it's so far in the past now. over fifteen years }
<A>__{whale stops himself. he smiles gently at clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{making movies was the most wonderful thing in the world. working with friends. entertaining people. yes, i suppose i miss it. more so now that }
<A>__{whale reaches into his pocket, takes out the bottle of luminal.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world. yes. i wish i had done more work.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you've done a helluva lot more than most people.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{better work.}
<A>__{whale moves across the room to the screen door.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but i chose freedom. david was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue. i didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend." the dirty little secret of a nervous producer.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{how long were you...?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{twenty years. too long. we were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. so i finally decided to close down the show.}
<A>__{whale places a pill on his tongue and swallows. he fixes clay with a pinched smile.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{when all fetters are loosened, a certain hedonism creeps in, don't you think? there was a period when this house was overrun with young men. some even posed for me. right where you're sitting now.}
<A>__{clay sits uncomfortably in his chair. his face flushes.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{of course, they weren't nearly as bashful. no, this room was once filled with bare buttocks. and pricks. hard, arrogant pricks }
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{cut it out!}
<A>__{clay explodes out of his chair, knocking over a small side table.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{fuck it. i can't do this anymore.}
<A>__{he looms over whale, whose breathing starts to quicken.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy? do you have to rub my nose in it?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i assure you, mr. boone, i meant no }
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{from now on, mr. whale, i cut your grass and that's it. understand?}
<A>__{before whale can respond clay storms out, nearly ripping the screen door off its hinges. whale sits on the daybed, takes a few quick breaths. suddenly the air is filled with the sounds of people cavorting in the pool. whale looks up, sees a young man standing outside the screen door. it is now dark outside.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{come on, jimmy. watch me dive.}
<A>__{whale offers a melancholy smile.}

<D>__{i think we're ready to go.}
<A>__{he glances over, sees clay in plaid bathing trunks, sitting apart from the others. he is puffing on a camel.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you're up, mr. boone.}
<A>__{clay ignores him. whale puts down his martini and cigar, picks up a polaroid camera. he moves over to clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{the extras are in their places. now we need the star. wouldn't you like to get in the pool?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you first.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh no. i never swim.}
<A>__{whale removes clay's cigarette, crushes it with his shoe. behind him, the pool is now a pit full of naked shadows.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you'll have to remove that shirt.}
<A>__{whale touches clay's bare chest. clay grabs hold of his wrist, causing the old man to yelp in pain. in the pool, the extras shriek in alarm. clay's hands close tightly around whale's throat.}
<L>__{interior whale's house bedroom day}
<A>__{whale's hands fly to his throat. he opens his eyes and gasps greedily for air, the young men's screams lingering in the room. there is a look of genuine terror on his face.}

<D>__{look, is sis there? i want to tell her about this movie person i met out here. she'll get a kick out of it.}

<D>__{no, i still...i'd give you my phone number if i had a phone }
<A>__{clay tries to stay calm as his mother berates him for not staying in touch.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{how's the old man?}
<A>__{before clay can protest we hear: "hold on." clay glances out at couples strolling up the promenade. an operator interrupts, says: "one dollar for the next three minutes." clay deposits two quarters before his mother returns. "he's busy, clay."}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{the operator comes on again, asking for fifty more cents. clay stares at the quarters in his hand.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{time's up. i better go.}

<D>__{i have my family. also our lord jesus christ.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{of course. how is the old boy these days?}

<D>__{i don't hear anything.}
<C>__{whale}

<C>__{whale}
<D>__{slim pickings. well, it's early yet. perhaps this is a good time to pay our respects.}

<C>__{whale}
<D>__{let's get this over with quickly.}
<A>__{whale forgets to remove his hat when he comes forward. before he can give cukor their names princess margaret's polite smile bursts open in a joyful display of teeth.}

<C>__{whale}
<D>__{sit?}
<C>__{princess margaret}
<D>__{i've changed my hair, you see. since our last session. those old snaps look rather dowdy now.}

<C>__{whale}
<D>__{ma'am, the pleasure is all mine. james whale.}

<D>__{i am such a goose. i mistook you for cecil beaton. it's the hat. you're wearing one of cecil's hats, you know.}

<C>__{george cukor}
<D>__{yes. of course. one can't throw a rock in this town without hitting one of us old movie directors.}

<C>__{whale}
<D>__{ma'am, may i present mr. clayton boone?}

<C>__{whale}
<D>__{my gardener, who insisted i bring him today. he so wanted to meet royalty.}
<A>__{cukor's face goes blank with indignation.}

<D>__{quite. i adore gardens.}
<A>__{whale narrows his eyes at cukor and sharpens his smile.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{he's never met a princess. only queens.}
<A>__{cukor puffs out his chest, quivers a bulbous lower lip at whale.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{george, ma'am, this has been an honor. an occasion to remember for the rest of my days.}
<A>__{he leads clay away and an american couple promptly crowd in to take their place. striding through the garden, whale is obviously pleased with himself.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what was that about?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{nothing of importance. just two old men slapping each other with lilies. shall we have a drink?}
<A>__{whale leads clay to a tented bar. across the way, david lewis has come through the gate with a woman on his arm. people look discreetly, not at david but at the woman, lightly veiled in a scarf and sunglasses.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{david. the friend i thought was in new york.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no. the girl.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{girl? oh. elizabeth taylor.}
<A>__{clay watches in amazement as elizabeth taylor waves to someone and pipes out a happy hello. she hurriedly unties her scarf, thrusts it at david and runs off on tiptoes to embrace a woman.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{is that really her?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{david produced her last picture.}
<A>__{david glances around while he slips the scarf into a coat pocket. he sees whale looking at him. he puts on a tight smile and strolls across the patio.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{just what i was about to ask you. i thought you were in new york.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i was, until last night. publicity asked me to fly miss taylor in for today's reception.}
<A>__{the waiter arrives with their drinks. only when clay takes his glass of beer does david see that whale is not alone.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{david lewis.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{clay boone.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{our yardman. who was kind enough to serve as my escort to george's little do.}
<A>__{david freezes. whale lifts his martini glass at clay and takes a sip.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{should you be drinking in your condition?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh, david, stop being a nanny.}
<A>__{clay clears his throat, eager to escape this domestic squabble.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i think i will go look at elizabeth taylor.}
<A>__{he hurries off.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you should have seen georgie's face when he met clayton.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you didn't, jimmy.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i did. but princess margaret was a doll. we're all equals in her eyes. as commoners, i presume.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you only embarrass yourself.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh dear. i will never work in this town again?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you know what i mean. your reputation.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but i have no reputation. i'm as free as the air.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well the rest of us aren't. can't you remember that?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no. i never could. you must regret having had the invitation sent.}
<A>__{david is looking over whale's shoulder.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i didn't ask george to invite you.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{then who did?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{jimmy, there are people here i need to speak to. you'll be fine on your own?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes. perfectly.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{all right, then. i will come by tomorrow for breakfast.}
<A>__{whale nods, watches david stroll over to the pool and greet a gaggle of executives. whale drifts toward some deck chairs at the far end of the croquet lawn. he sits, takes a sip of his drink. suddenly a high pitched giggle pierces the air.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{mr. whale!}
<A>__{whale looks out to see edmund kay, his interviewer from several weeks ago, marching across the lawn.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{mr....kay?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{bet you thought you'd never see me again. i didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you didn't?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i'm the one who got you on mr. cukor's guest list.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you, mr. kay? how do you know george cukor?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i interviewed him after i met you. i'm his social secretary now. well, assistant to his secretary.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i commend you. if you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you. you waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{don't think that, mr. whale. i love your movies. that's why i wanted you to come to this. so i could see you with your monsters.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{my monsters?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{don't go away.}
<A>__{whale tries to do just that, but finds himself caught in the chair. he is stumbling to his feet when kay returns with elsa lanchester, 55, at his side.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{jimmy. how are you?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{elsa?}
<A>__{she takes whale's hand, with a look of deep concern and sympathy. kay races off again.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{i saw una o'conner a few weeks ago. she said you'd been under the weather.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh, nothing out of the ordinary. growing old.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{we're all getting a bit long in the tooth.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but you appear quite fresh, my dear.}
<A>__{she swats aside the compliment and gestures at the chair.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{please. you shouldn't stand on my account.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{perfectly all right. but if you'd like to sit }
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{i'm fine, jimmy. i can only stay a few minutes.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{what's our pesky friend up to now?}
<A>__{kay returns, accompanied by a stopped, gray haired man with a long rectangular face and wary, heavy lidded eyes.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{is that boris? our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh dear.}
<A>__{karloff, age 70, comes reluctantly, followed by his niece alice, a bashful young woman who carried a blanket wrapped bundle.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{boris, darling. i didn't know you were here. these public revels are hardly up your alley.}
<C>__{boris karloff}
<D>__{i came for the sake of my visiting niece. alice. and miranda, my great niece.}
<A>__{his huge hand lifts the blanket in alice's arms, revealing a bald infant with enormous blue eyes. karloff gurgles and coos at the child.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{and what do you make of our royal visitant?}
<C>__{boris karloff}
<D>__{perfectly charming. a real lady.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{of course she's a lady. what did you expect? a hussy in tennis shoes?}
<A>__{whale looks up and discovers clay standing a few feet behind karloff. he is ogling two bosomy actresses who are listening intently to the monocled british consul. whale's eyes try to focus karloff and clay together, his once and future monsters. kay shouts to a passing photographer carrying a bulky speed graphic.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{hey, you! with the camera! we got a historical moment here. come get a picture of it.}
<A>__{the man scans the scene for a famous face.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{this is mr. james whale, who made "frankenstein" and "bride of frankenstein." and this is the monster and his bride.}
<A>__{clay looks up when he hears kay identify karloff.}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{oh, karloff. right.}
<A>__{karloff and elsa drift into position next to whale. the flash goes off, a snap and a crunch of light. whale cringes in pain.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<P>__{(through clenched teeth)}
<D>__{don't you just love being famous?}
<A>__{another flash. from whale's perspective, the bulb resembles nothing so much as the translucent tube of electrical current from dr. frankenstein's laboratory. whale concentrates on his smile as another snap of light stabs his brain. he clutches elsa lanchester's hand.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{are you all right, jimmy?}
<A>__{a sharp nod from whale. the photographer motions to karloff's niece.}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{let me get one with frankenstein holding the kid.}
<A>__{alice hands over the baby. karloff gently cradles the child. whale stands on his left, elsa on his right. they all smile at the baby, who gurgles and points up. whale follows the baby's gaze to the sky, where a large kite rocks and strains in a furious electrical storm. the camera flashes once, then again.}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{got it!}
<A>__{whale glances up the kite is gone. thunder rumbles as the group starts to disperse. whale nods to the faces exchanging good byes.}
<C>__{boris karloff}
<D>__{so good to see you again, james.}
<A>__{he strolls off, clucking and cooing at his baby.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{catch you before you go, mr. whale. i will make sure everybody gets sent a printerior}
<A>__{he goes off with the photographer. elsa kisses whale on the cheek.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{we'll be in touch, jimmy.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{good bye. so nice to see you...}
<A>__{finally whale is alone. he staggers to the deck chair and lowers himself sideways into the lawn chair.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{whale gazes up at clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{tired. a bit tired.}
<A>__{clay nods. whale smiles at him.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{are you enjoying yourself?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{actually, no. i feel a little out of place.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{neither of us really belongs here.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{must have been funny for you. seeing your monsters again.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{monsters? the only monsters...}
<P>__{(closes his eyes)}
<D>__{...are here.}
<A>__{across the lawn, conversation has stopped. birdlike shrieks come from all directions.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{oh fuck. and we left the top down. you want to run for it?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{run for what?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{can't you see? it's raining!}
<A>__{the rain is only a flickering of air, but people are jumping and shrieking, throwing coats over their heads as they dash toward the house.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{he takes whale under the arm, helps him up and escorts him to a small tent. on the patio, everyone shoves and squeezes to get through the one open door. whale stares out, hypnotized by the deluge. from his pov, we see a young man step into the rain. whale squints, is finally able to identify the man as leonard barnett. whale's eyes follow barnett as he emerges onto a new landscape, a scarred and barren battlefield. as the storm continues to rage:}
<C>__{clay }
<D>__{mr. whale?}

<D>__{we're not sugar. we won't melt.}

<C>__{clay}

<D>__{but that was so long ago. it can't still bother you.}

<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you're planning a trip?}

<C>__{clay}
<D>__{your friend?}
<A>__{whale gazes out at the storm. from his pov, we see a scarred and barren landscape, illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{he caught his one night coming back from the reconnoiter. i wouldn't take him out, but mcgill did. just to give the lad a taste. they were nearly home when a maxim gun opened fire.}

<P>__{(through clenched teeth)}
<D>__{come on. come on.}

<C>__{whale}
<D>__{we saw him at morning stand to and evening stand to. "good morning, barnett," we'd say each day. "how's ole barnett looking this morning?" "seems a little peaky. looks a little plumper." his wounds faced the other way and his hat shielded his eyes, so one could imagine he was napping on bedsprings. he hung there until we were relieved. we introduced him to the new unit before we marched out, speaking highly of his companionship.}
<A>__{clay's eyes are filled with pity.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh, but we were a witty lot. laughing at our dead. telling ourselves it was our death too. but with each man who died, i thought, "better you than me, poor sod."}

<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh no, my friend. it's digging itself up. there is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it. all my diversions have abandoned me. parties. reading. painting. work. love. all gone to me now.}
<A>__{whale remains perfectly still, staring out the window. clay deliberates a moment, then puts down his drink next to the decanter of scotch. he stands and yanks the neck of the sweater over his face, then tosses it on the sofa. whale blinks at the reflection in the glass, not yet understanding.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you wanted to draw me like a greek statue. all right, then.}
<A>__{clay pulls at the knot, lets go of the towel. he defiantly parks his hands on his hips.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{there. not so bad.}
<A>__{whale continues to stare at the reflection, his back to clay, his eyes wide and expressionless. he turns slowly, fully expecting the vision to evaporate. when he sees that clay is truly naked he mutters softly under his breath.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{so it is going to happen after all.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what'd you say?}

<A>__{whale reaches for the hatbox, which sits on top of a garbage can. suddenly a large hand appears on the box. whale gasps when a flash of lightning reveals the face of the monster. the monster growls out an inarticulate greeting. he picks up the box and hands it to whale.}

<A>__{whale removes the lid, sets the hatbox on the sofa.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i would like you to wear this?}

<C>__{clay}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{for the artistic effect. the combination of your human body and that inhuman mask. it's quite striking.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{please, clayton. just for a minute. long enough for me to see the effect.}
<C>__{clay}

<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{there are straps in back.}

<C>__{whale}
<D>__{let me help you.}

<C>__{clay}
<D>__{now what?}
<A>__{mouth muffled by the inhalator, clay hears his voice from inside his head. whale comes around to stand in front of him. he grins as he steps back to examine clay. clay nervously taps his knees with his hands.}

<D>__{all right. let's take it off now.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it's too tight.}

<C>__{whale}
<D>__{we don't want to tear the straps.}

<A>__{two hands grip clay's shoulders.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what steely muscles, clayton.}
<A>__{whale's hands squeeze. clay grabs the frame of his seat, to stop his arms from automatically swinging a fist. whale's hand slides over clay's shoulder to his arm, caressing the tattoo. clay jerks his shoulder to shake whale off.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{just take off the fucking mask!}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{relax, clayton. i can't hear you. i can't hear a word.}

<A>__{whale's tongue moves down clay's arm.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no? maybe this, then?}
<A>__{the hand slides over clay's stomach toward his lap. the tattooed arm swings backward, slamming an elbow against whale's skull. clay jumps from the chair, knocking into an end table. the glass and crystal decanter fall to the floor. the lamp spills over and the room goes dark. clay's ankle is caught by the sofa leg and he hits the floor, jamming the inhalator against his mouth. he quickly gets up, on his knees and elbows, pulling at the mask. flashes of lightning strobe the room as whale collapses over clay's back and holds on.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh yes. i have you now.}
<A>__{a strap breaks. clay rips the mask off.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{get the fuck off!}
<A>__{whale's hand squeezes between clay's legs.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what will you do to get yourself back?}
<A>__{clay jabs with his elbow, flipping whale on his back. his body straddles whale's and pins him, face to face.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm not that way. get it through your fucking head. i don't want to mess with you.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh, but you feel good, clayton.}
<A>__{his hands clasp clay's hips. clay's fist opens as it comes down; he slaps whale across the face.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{that didn't even sting. you're not such a real man after all. are you?}
<A>__{clay whacks whale's face again.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{wait until i tell my friends i had you naked in my arms. won't they be surprised?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i haven't done a damn thing with you!}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh, but you have. you undressed for me. i kissed you. i even touched your prick. how will you be able to live with yourself?}
<A>__{clay snatches whale's wrist before it can touch his crotch. with his other hand he picks up the heavy crystal decanter.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what the hell do you want from me?!}
<A>__{whale tilts his face up for another blow.}
<D>__{whale i want you to kill me .}
<A>__{clay freezes. he stares down at the old man with white hair and wild eyes lying beneath him.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{break my neck. or strangle me. it would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me. please, clayton. we've come this far.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you're crazy.}
<A>__{whale's eyes glimmer in the sporadic bursts of lightning.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{exactly, i'm losing my mind. every day, another piece goes. soon there will be nothing left. look at the sketch i made of you.}
<A>__{clay turns to the sketch pad, which lies on the floor next to whale. the page is filled with nothing but doodles and scrawls.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{look, if you want to die do it yourself!}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no, i don't want to die alone. but to be killed by you that would make death bearable. they say you never see the one with your name on it. but i want to see death coming at me. i want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face. your face. think, clayton. you'd be my second monster. almost as famous as the first. it would be the great adventure you've yearned for. a war story for both of us to share.}
<A>__{clay's breathing comes in quick, panicked bursts.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you'd be fully exonerated, i've taken care of that. i wrote a note, i will even leave you the house, the car...}

<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{poor mr. jimmy. we do not mean disrespect. you will keep better in water.}
<A>__{she nods to clay. he rolls the body over and it splashes on its belly. it bounces a moment in the waves of the splash, then begins to sink. as it drops, the air in the chest slowly flips the body around. looking up at them with open eyes, whale sinks backward into the thickening light. his arms trail upward and the hands lightly flutter as if waving good bye. the melancholy sound of a solo violin pierces the silence as we cut to:}
<L>__{exterior interior blind man's hut night}
<A>__{a black and white scene from "bride of frankenstein." the old blind man plays a mournful lullaby on his violin while the monster listens outside, moved by the music. he smashes open the door of the hut in an effort to get closer to the soul soothing sound. the blind man stops playing, looks up.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{who is it? you're welcome, my friend, whoever you are.}
<A>__{the monster attempts to communicate, manages only a plaintive moan. the blind man stands.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{i cannot see you. i cannot see anything. you must please excuse me. but i am blind.}
<A>__{the monster holds out his burned hands.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{come in, my poor friend. no one will hurt you here. if you're in trouble, perhaps i can help you.}
<A>__{the old man touches the monster, who recoils with a defensive growl.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{can you not speak? it's strange. perhaps you're afflicted too. i cannot see and you cannot speak.}
<L>__{interior suburban house night (1972)}
<A>__{michael boone, 10, lies on the living room carpet, staring raptly at the movie playing on the large zenith console. the house is small but tidy and comfortable.}
<C>__{blind man }
<D>__{it's been a long time since any human being came into this hut. i shall look after you. and you will comfort me.}
<A>__{on the tv screen, the old man starts to cry, then collapses onto the monster's chest. a thick tear rolls down the monster's cheek. clay boone sits on the sofa, a baby on his lap. he's 40 now, his hair starting to thin but still closely cropped at the top and sides. on the tv, daylight fills the hut. the blind man and the monster share a meal.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{we are friends, you and i. friends.}
<C>__{monster}
<D>__{friends.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{before you came, i was all alone. it is bad to be alone.}
<C>__{monster}
<D>__{alone, bad. friend, good.}
<A>__{he takes the old man's hand.}
<C>__{monster}
<D>__{friend, good.}
<A>__{the blind man nods. on the sofa, clay watches his son watch the movie.}
<L>__{interior living room night (later)}
<A>__{a color promo for "chiller theater" fills the screen. clay turns off the set.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{time for bed, sport.}
<A>__{michael groans, slowly stands.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what'd you think of the movie?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{pretty cool. better than most monster movies.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i knew the guy who made it.}
<A>__{michael glances skeptically at his father.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{come on, dad. is this another one of your stories?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{clay unfolds whale's sketch of the monster, hands it to his son.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it's his original sketch of the monster.}
<A>__{michael turns over the sketch. on the back, scrawled in block letters: "to clayton boone friend?"}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{this is for real?}
<A>__{clay nods. at the same time, his wife dana appears in the doorway. a pretty, cheerful woman in her mid 30s.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{the trash, clay. before it rains.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{clay kisses the top of his son's head.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{off to bed.}
<L>__{exterior clay's house night}
<A>__{clay carries a large metal bin down the tidy lawn. the sky momentarily brightens with a silent flash of lightning. clay gazes up at the electrical storm. he glances back at his house, sees dana cradling the baby in an upstairs window. the skies open with a shattering crash of thunder. clay tilts up his face, drinks in the cool rain. then he extends his arms and staggers along the sidewalk, imitating the monster's famous lurch. we pull back, revealing a sleepy neighborhood of small houses and neat lawns, until clay is only a small dot in the landscape.}
