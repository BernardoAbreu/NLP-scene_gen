<L>__{27 interior pentonville prison blackwood's cell day}
<A>__{holmes approaches blackwood's cell, strolling insouciantly. no way this creep's getting to him. in the shadows he can barely make out blackwood, who's reading aloud to himself. holmes listens, getting closer.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{quote from revelations tbd...}
<A>__{blackwood pauses, turns, sees holmes. they share a smile two heavyweights sizing each other up.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{love what you've done with the place.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{thank you for joining me.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{a small point of concern.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{how can i help?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i'd already followed the murders with some interest and while my heart went out to the families of the victims, i couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush }
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{you're too kind.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{however, by comparison, your work in the crypt was akin to a finger painting.}
<A>__{suddenly, blackwood is right at the bars, close to holmes.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{so now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot, and that's why you're really here.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{actually, my friend will pronounce you dead shortly and i thought i might keep him company.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{allow me to enlighten you. your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly has led to this moment. your error in judgement is to assume i've been holding the brush at all i am merely the channel.}
<A>__{despite the bars between them, the men are close together. holmes seems to be studying blackwood's ear.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{my only wish is that i'd caught you earlier. i might have spared five lives.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{those lives were a necessity, a sacrifice. five otherwise meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i wonder if they'd let watson and i dissect your brain after you're hanged, of course. i'd wager there's some deformity that would be scientifically significant. then you would serve a greater purpose, too.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{mr. holmes, you must widen your gaze. i'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{for you and i are bound on a journey that will twist the very fabric of nature.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i sense fragility beneath your mask of logic, and it worries me. steel your mind, holmes, i need you.}
<A>__{holmes steps back, shakes his head.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i must say, you've come a long way down from the house of lords.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{but i will rise again.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{bon voyage, blackwood.}
<A>__{as holmes walks away, blackwood calls after him.}
<C>__{blackwood}
<D>__{pay attention! three more shall die, and there is nothing you can do to save them.}
<C>__{blackwood }
<D>__{you must accept that this is beyond your control, or by the time you realize it was you that made it all possible it will be the last sane thought in your head.}
