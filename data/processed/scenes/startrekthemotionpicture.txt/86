<A>__{as, first on the viewer, the whiplash energy bolt effect clings another moment then begins fading. and then it is gone. the bridge lights go on again. elevator doors open. doctor chapel and medical corps men arrive and cross immediately to where ilia tends to the injured chekov.}

<D>__{engineering to bridge; we cannot hold full power on forcefields; deflector power is down seventy percent !}
<A>__{chekov's station over the following, we will hear captain kirk ad lib order; "divert auxiliary systems power to deflectors!" and scott intercom voice answer: "all auxiliary power to deflectors, sir." meanwhile, chapel and corpsmen giving medical treatment to chekov who is in agony. chapel is about to give an injection.}
<C>__{ilia}
<D>__{no, i can stop his pain.}
<A>__{the deltan woman takes chekov's upper arm in both her hands, kneading her fingers deep into nerve centers chekov's pain begins to quickly recede and he is almost startled by the sudden relief. doctor chapel, now spraying plasti skin on the burned hand and wrist, gives ilia a surprised, approving look and a flicker of female friendship passes between the deltan and earth woman. (setting up a later story point) close on viewer (o) the energy brilliance gone now, we can see the cloud is very close the closest we have seen it yet, and the aurora effect is spectacular; a vast, dense blan ket of sparkling, flaring color.}

<A>__{chapel and corpsman are assisting chekov from the bridge (we'll have seen that the remarkable plasti skin sprayed on his hand has completley covered the ugly burn marks he is even able to move his fingers a bit). ilia returns to her station a relief crew woman takes over from decker at chekov's console. closer on spock's station so we can see in more detail spock's monitor various oscillating waves, and hear more of the shrill beeps as spock manipulates his equipment, and continues:}
