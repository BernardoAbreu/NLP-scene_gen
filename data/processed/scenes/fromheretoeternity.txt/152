<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{as warden runs in. broken glass lies all over the floor. bullet holes are stitched across the top of warden's footlocker. he throws back the lid fiercely. his linen is polka dotted with holes. he tosses out shirts, shorts, etc., digs underneath them. he pulls out a quart bottle of whisky; it is untouched. warden smiles with relief. he lifts the bottle to his lips, drinks long and heartily.}
