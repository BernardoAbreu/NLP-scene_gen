<A>__{tim turns back, sees ronald walking away. tim thinks a beat, then keeps on. other than dean's splashing, it's quiet and peaceful in the semi darkness. joan sits on a lawn chair.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{whaddaya say, lippe? take a dippy?}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(german accent)}
<D>__{ich can nicht schwimmen. that's "i can't swim." in german. and i can't. `sides, i didn't bring a bathing suit.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{so we stay in the shallow end.}
<P>__{(starts removing clothes)}
<D>__{and neither did i.}
<A>__{gulp. now in her bra and thong, joan jumps in. dean bobs around with the trash can on his head. tim slowly starts to undress. he carefully places his money belt on a table. he gets down to his t shirt and tightie whities. far enough. he eases himself into the shallow end.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{yow. chilly. ha.}
<A>__{joan back strokes over to tim. he tries to look elsewhere.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{so.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{yep. ha. fun. fun day.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{so.}
<A>__{joan undoes her bra. oh jeez.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{oh jeez.}
<A>__{she removes the bra, revealing her breasts lovely, soft, bright white orbs surrounded by very tan skin. tim shudders.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{you have tan. a tan. tan line. you have a.}
<A>__{joan gets close to tim. his arms remain at his side.}

<D>__{i have a fian...}
<A>__{she kisses him on the mouth, moves his hands to her breasts.}

<C>__{dean}
<D>__{hell yeah.}
<A>__{joan pulls off tim's t shirt, flings it aside. they're really going to town. off screen, we hear a sliding door open. high angle (specifically, four floors up): from this pov, it looks like tim and joan are having sex. dean, meanwhile, has moved closer and may or may not be masturbating as he watches them. reveal whose pov this is: orin has come out onto his balcony. he looks aghast.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{what the heck's going on down there?!}
<A>__{tim looks up, makes fleeting eye contact with orin. shit! tim scrambles to get out of the pool. joan is a half step behind him. dean decides that now would be a good time to moon orin.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{suck my ass, helgesson.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{i'm calling security!}
<A>__{tim grabs his money belt as he and joan run out of the pool area. [note: tim has a conspicuous erection.]}
