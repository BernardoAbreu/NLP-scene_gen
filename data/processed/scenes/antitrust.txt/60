<A>__{milo and lisa walk, eat ice cream out of paper cups with outpost logos. they laugh. we go nearer.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{so, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. was that then? or now?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{then and now.}
<P>__{(when he looks at her)}
<D>__{but not right now.}
<A>__{she maintains eye contact. her meaning is clear.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{milo!}
<A>__{milo turns, sees brian (stanford classmate, outpost zealot) give an envelope to a guard at the door of #20; he trots over to milo, who is as flustered as another guy might be having been found in bed with a girl.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{just dropped off a resume. almost got in the front door.}
<A>__{he looks at lisa, back to milo, wondering why he isn't being introduced.}

<P>__{(gives him a business card)}
<D>__{can you help me?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{sure, i will see what i can do.}
<A>__{seeing how flushed milo is, brian thinks he must have blundered in on something. he starts to back away.}

<D>__{well i parked illegally. see y'later?}
<C>__{milo}
