<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior roadside diner early morning}
<A>__{a strip of two lane highway runs through a tall pine forest. there is a truck stop coffee shop beside the roadway. a few 14 wheelers are scattered across the big dusty parking lot. morning sunlight glints off their chrome stacks. it bakes the asphalt and warms the mangy hides of stray dogs asleep in the dirt. a helicopter hovers about the treetops like a lazy hummingbird. it's the beginning of a perfect day. a highway patrol car slowly trolls among the trucks and dogs and parks beside the slat and shingled building. two telephone linemen are scaling a power pole at the forest's edge.}
<L>__{2 power pole angle on telephone linemen}
<A>__{high on the pole, the linemen lean back against their safety straps to work, their bodies forming a "y." one of them suddenly turns, pointing at a nearby treetop.}
<C>__{first lineman}
<D>__{lookee there!}
<A>__{he grabs a porcelain insulator from his belt, cocks his arm and hurls it across the open stretch. it lands smack in the middle of the tree. squawk! a rattle of leaves, a rustle of feathers and a huge buzzard comes flapping out. the lineman cackles over his marksmanship.}
<L>__{3 close angle on buzzard moving shot}
<A>__{the big, frightened beady eyed bird is lumbering through the sky, flapping for its life and suddenly...splat! it crashes head on into}
<L>__{3a the bubble of the passing helicopter. interior helicopter}
<A>__{the ship rocks as the pilot wrestles the controls. there are three others in the cabin. the man beside the pilot, eli cross, is sketching in a manuscript and eating an apple. he glances up in irritation.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{hey, will you stop wiggling?!}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{don't yell at me...yell at the goddamn crazy bird! it tried to kill us!}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(back to his manuscript)}
<D>__{oh yeah, that's your story. what's the bird got to say about it?}
<A>__{eli bites into his apple, grimacing at the mushy mouthful he tosses it out the hatch.}
<L>__{exterior forest treetops}
<A>__{the apple drops into the trees, bounces down from branch to branch and falls on the slanted roof of the roadside diner beneath. it rolls down the eaves, off the edge and lands on top of the parked highway patrol car.}
<L>__{interior patrol car}
<C>__{first policeman}
<D>__{something hit the roof.}
<C>__{second policeman}
<D>__{so will the chief...if we don't grab this guy cameron.}
<A>__{they climb out as we see a second patrol car sliding up behind them. more policemen emerge from the second car.}
<L>__{exterior diner on policemen}
<A>__{they huddle, then move toward the diner entrance. as they pass an open window the camera holds.}
<L>__{interior diner}
<A>__{a fry cook serves behind the long counter where men on stools eat watching the overhead tv. there is a pinball machine in action. the policemen are seen entering b.g. a truck driver ambles up and straddles a stool.}
<C>__{truck driver}
<D>__{gettin' hot early. it's gonna be a scorcher.}
<A>__{the fry cook fills the driver's empty water glass from a pitcher, then move down the counter.}
<L>__{9 angle on cameron}
<A>__{he sits a few stools away. he's about 25, even featured, bone weary. his appealing face needs a shave. the cook fills his water glass. the ice cubes rattle as cameron's hand trembles. his eyes are riveted on the policemen.}
<L>__{10 cameron's pov}
<A>__{two policemen take seats at a booth across from the counter; one policeman moves to a wall telephone, another stands near the cash register looking at a magazine. they seem nonchalant, but are placed to block all avenues of escape.}
<L>__{11 angle on cameron}
<A>__{suddenly startled as someone slaps him on the arm. he whirls to face the man beside him.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{that's really a beaut...really a beaut!}
<A>__{the man is staring at the tatoo which shows below the rolled up sleeve of cameron's shirt, a large american eagle with elaborate scrollwork and a patriotic slogan. the man pulls up his own sleeve to show a small tatoo of an anchor.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{my wife still yells about this...but yours that's some eagle...like a billboard.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(eyes on police)}
<D>__{yeah, that's the grand old bird.}
<P>__{(a half smile)}
<D>__{right now i just wish the son of a bitch could fly.}
<A>__{cameron rises and moves across the diner to the pinball machine.}
<L>__{12 angle on pinball}
<A>__{the player wiggles and contorts, using body english to influence the balls.}
<C>__{heckler}
<D>__{hey morton, you think your ass is connected to the machine? you wiggle, it's gonna make the ball go where you want?}
<L>__{12a cameron's eyes scan the room, passing the tv above the counter. on}
<A>__{it, the commercial shows a beautiful girl (who we'll later know as nina franklin) bending over a bowl of dog food. her ass, too,}
<L>__{12b wiggles engagingly. the pinball player leaves the machine.}
<A>__{cameron, stalling for time, works the plunger while a cop stalks closer; like the cat to the mouse hole.}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{hey, you're lucky. somebody left a free ball.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{cameron shoots. the ball bounces crazily inside the machine, lights and buzzers flashing. another policeman approaches.}
<C>__{second policeman}
<D>__{you got 20,000! you're gonna win...}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{win what?}
<C>__{second policeman}
<D>__{a free game!}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{terrific...}
<A>__{he rests his hands on the machine, glancing about. escape seems hopeless.}
<C>__{cameron }
<D>__{...that's just what i needed...one more chance to lose.}
<A>__{in a lightning swift motion, the cop clamps his hands down over cameron's wrists, snapping the handcuffs on. the trap has sprung.}
<L>__{13 close on cop and cameron}
<A>__{cameron nods his head in resignation. a big uncontrollable grin breaks and spreads over the cop's face. then suddenly, cameron bolts, desperately springing full speed for the back door. he flings it open. the cops are moving toward him. one has almost got his gun out.}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{cameron! halt! i will shoot!}
<A>__{cameron lunges through the doorway, not realizing in his frenzy the screen door still blocks his path. he tears through it, but gets stuck halfway.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(panicked)}
<D>__{no!...god, don't shoot!}
<A>__{swinging his manacled arms like a club against the tangled mesh, he breaks free and runs.}
<L>__{exterior rear of diner}
<A>__{as cameron flies down the back steps, a cop stationed at the rear door, caught off guard, tries to stop him but is shoved flat on his back. cameron weaves and scrambles across the yard, over fences, between the shed and the barn, rolling beneath a building, out the other side. behind him, distant shouts and a gunshot.}
<L>__{interior forest moving shot on cameron day}
<A>__{as cameron runs, he moves with a skill that suggests forests are not alien to him. he crouches low, following tiny avenues in the maze of tree trunks, scrambling on all fours over needles and fallen cones. sweat pours down his face. his breath rasps in his throat. he breaks into a clearing and freezes...suddenly face to face with a man who crouches, blocking his path. it is one of the telephone linemen we saw earlier.}
<L>__{16 wider angle}
<A>__{the lineman, kneeling at his tool chest, is surprised by cameron. the other lineman is halfway up the power pole. they both stare at cameron's handcuffs. cameron edges back, his escape route blocked. the man on the ground grabs a wrench and moves forward with the same gleam in his eye we saw when he scared that bird from the tree.}
<C>__{lineman}
<D>__{stand right there like a good old boy and do what i say. you wanna try and mess with me, you've had fair warning. i was a combat marine in korea. okay?}
<A>__{the lineman advances on him as cameron backs away.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{korea? no shit, so was my old man...}
<P>__{(he suddenly stamps his foot and shrieks)}
<D>__{aaaaaaaargh!}
<A>__{the lineman jumps in surprise. then, enraged like a startled bull, he lunges forward with the wrench. cameron uses the man's weight against him, his moves those of a trained fighter. a hard knee to his stomach doubles up the lineman. the handcuffed arms slam down like a club between his shoulder blades driving him to the ground. a kick thrown sideways to his head and the man is out. the other lineman who had started to descend the pole freezes and takes one step back up. cameron grabs the lineman's toolbox in his handcuffed grasp and dashes off into the forest.}
<L>__{17 moving shot on cameron}
<A>__{he slides down a slope on a carpet of fallen leaves, tumbling to the bottom and falls face forward into a running stream where he holds his head and drinks. camera moves across the terrain. there are no pursuers, the forest is silent.}
<L>__{18 close up handcuffs}
<A>__{the jaws of a wire cutter clamp down severing the chain connecting the cuffs around cameron's wrists. he lifts his knee from the cutter handle. his arms are now free. he wedges a chisel against one bracelet and swings a sledgehammer against it. we hear his sharp outcry.}
<L>__{19 angle on cameron}
<A>__{doubled up, holding his wrist in pain. the bracelet is still intact. he buttons his shirt cuffs over the metal bands and climbs the slope to the bright sunlight on the road above.}
<L>__{exterior old abandoned road day}
<A>__{cameron is trudging along the old road winding down through the mountainous pass. he crosses a bridge. through the arches of its low stone railing, he sees a black river twenty feet below rushing toward the sea. then, glancing back, he is suddenly alert.}
<L>__{21 cameron's pov}
<A>__{in the far distance, almost lost in the shimmering heat waves from the road, is a tiny speck moving toward him.}
<L>__{22 angle on cameron}
<A>__{he clambers down the embankment behind the railing, peering out from this hidden vantage.}
<L>__{23 angle on road}
<A>__{the speck grows larger. the sound of the engine is faintly audible now. sunlight flashes from metal and glass. cameron's apprehension suddenly changes to wonderment, for the vehicle is not the police as he had feared, but something else. moving in the shimmering heat wave is a splendid, high, humpbacked world war i vintage duesenberg sedan with gleaming brass headlights, roaring towards him.}
<L>__{24 angle on cameron}
<A>__{he scrambles up the embankment to thumb a ride. the duesenberg roars past him, filling his eyes and mouth with dust. suddenly there is a screech of brakes.}
<L>__{25 angle on car}
<A>__{the duesenberg goes into a skid and then bounces to a stop. running, cameron reaches the car, pulls the front door open and climbs in beside the driver.}
<L>__{interior car}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{thanks. i thought you didn't see me.}
<A>__{the driver, burt, is a husky, red haired man about cameron's age and deeply agitated. pounding his fist against the steering wheel, he talks half to cameron, half to himself.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{damn it. screwed it up. lost my nerve.}
<A>__{fishing a vick's inhaler from his pocket and shoving it in his nostril.}
<C>__{burt }
<D>__{goddamn sinuses. can't even see straight.}
<A>__{cameron looks at him, puzzled.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{you want me to drive?}
<A>__{burt whirls on him, enraged.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{what the hell is that supposed to mean?!}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{no offense...thought you might...}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{every one of you jerks is a goddamn hotshot expert! thanks for the vote of confidence. if you think you can do any better, just come and try it!}
<A>__{he puts his boot in cameron's stomach and shoves hard.}
<L>__{exterior car}
<A>__{cameron comes flying out and lands on his back in the road as the duesenberg squeals forward, its open door slamming shut from the momentum. stunned, the wind knocked out of him, cameron rises to his elbows. before the old relic has gone thirty yards, again the brakes screech, swinging the car into a sliding salute turn, one hundred eighty degrees and it is suddenly screaming back toward cameron.}
<L>__{interior car angle on burt}
<A>__{driving with one hand on the door handle, his head halfway out the window watching the bridge railing and the water beyond.}
<L>__{29 angle on road car and cameron}
<A>__{cameron, sprawled on the road, is momentarily paralyzed at the sight of the duesenberg's great brass grill bearing down. his hand closes over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier flings a coke bottle at a tank, cameron hurls the rock in the direction of the car and frantically rolls sideways. the big spinning tires brush him as they pass. we catch a momentary glimpse of the rock smashing against the gleam of the passing windshield. as he stops rolling, once more face down in the dust, eyes closed, expecting death, he becomes aware there is only silence. he opens his eyes, climbs to his feet. the road is empty. the duesenberg is gone. astonished, confused he walks to the side of the bridge where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off. there is nothing below but the rushing black water. here and there bubbles swirl to the surface. they could be from a sinking car or could be caused by the current.}
<L>__{30 angle on cameron}
<A>__{his thoughts racing. was it the sun, has he imagined the whole thing? suddenly a helicopter appears, hovering, almost at eye level. sunlight flashes through the spinning blades like a strobe.}
<L>__{31 wider angle}
<A>__{it is the same helicopter we saw in the opening sequence. it has swiftly descended beside the bridge just beyond the railing, catching cameron with no chance to run or hide. four men can be seen inside the plastic cockpit barely a few feet away. the man beside the pilot is eli cross. he grabs the radio microphone and begins speaking into it. cameron whirls, scrambles down a bank to a field. the helicopter drops to within a few feet of the water, hovers. protected from sight, cameron runs between the tall stalks, away from the road.}
<L>__{32 cameron moving shot}
<A>__{glancing back through the stalks as he runs, cameron sees a stake truck barreling toward the sight of the accident. in the back, three men are frantically putting on black wet suits. they look, from this distance, like little black toys tumbling against each other. cameron runs on.}
<L>__{exterior bluff overlooking seashore town}
<A>__{a few hotels, like a cluster of old victorian gingerbread, surround a sandy cove beyond which is the sea. there is a fishing pier, boardwalk, hot dog stands, pizza parlors, all swarming with sunbathing tourists. the town's bucolic, turn of the century charm might even survive these, if not for a monstrous yellow construction crane, which juts ten stories into the sky from the center of the sandy cove. cameron appears on the bluff.}
<L>__{34 angle on cameron}
<A>__{surveying the town expressionless, a jungle beast going to survive no matter what at least for a few more hours. he reaches down and rips off his trouser legs at the thigh, turning them into cutoffs a vacationing bather might wear. he pulls off his worn boots and flings them into the brush, his eyes never leaving the town below. there are crowds to get lost in down there. he unbuttons his sleeve and looks at the handcuff still encircling his wrist. stopping beside a large rock, he smashes the bracelet against it. it won't open. grimacing in pain, he re buttons the sleeve, opens his shirt and begins descending the palisades toward the town.}
<L>__{exterior boardwalk}
<A>__{the screen is yellow and on it are the words: 'have a nice day.' the angle widens and we realize the words are on the back of a yellow hat that jiggles as its wearer walks. it is cameron. beyond him we see the tide of tourists in oils and ointments flirting with the sun. teenage girls at portable toilets adjusting their bikinis. the boardwalk cops in white shirts, looking like ice cream vendors, whom cameron deftly avoids. then, he looks up at the sky, perplexed: the helicopter from the bridge is overhead, circling. cameron watches it warily as he walks.}
<L>__{35a angle on boardwalk}
<A>__{a big crowd has formed at the railing of the pier. many of the people with cameras clicking at the sand below. cameron notices the helicopter is now sharing the sky with a brightly painted open cockpit biplane. it is a world war i fighter with british insignia.}
<L>__{35b angle on boardwalk and sky}
<A>__{cameron works his way through the crowd. all eyes now look upward at the plane. a loud voice is heard coming through an electric}
<B>__{bullhorn.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{all right, people. quiet! we're losing the sun! this is a take! you're welcome to watch, but please, no flashbulbs. they'll spoil the shot.}
<A>__{cameron's world has become more ordered again. it's a film company shooting on location this somehow must explain the duesenberg. his eyes go to the scene below.}
<L>__{36 angle on cove}
<A>__{a camera rig suspended from the end of the yellow construction crane is photographing the surf where extras in german wwi uniforms unload ashore. the bright little plane has started a lazy dive toward the soldiers, its engine whining. from here it looks as fearsome as snoopy and the red baron.}
<L>__{37 angle on the beach}
<A>__{as the british plane pulls out of the dive, there is a tremendous explosion. in the flash of smoke and flame, barge, rowboats, ammunition and people are blown sky high. the smoke from the exploding ammunition momentarily obscures the scene.}
<L>__{38 angle on crowd}
<A>__{the onlookers are very impressed and pleased and then abruptly their pleasure turns to horror and disbelief.}
<L>__{39 angle on cove}
<A>__{as the smoke lifts, the tom and jerry violence has become a horrifying reality. bodies are scattered about. one man has been severed in half, drenched in blood. chunks of meat, arms and legs litter the beach.}
<L>__{40 angle on crowd}
<A>__{paralyzed by the sense of catastrophe.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{something went wrong.}
<A>__{then, people begin to moan and scream.}
<L>__{41 close on cameron}
<A>__{staring tensely at the carnage. by reflex, a shout escapes his lips.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{medic! get the medics!}
<L>__{41a a woman sags into a fainterior a small child in the crowd is crying and}
<A>__{clutching cameron's leg.}
<L>__{42 angle on cove}
<A>__{as the scene continues we hear a voice on the bullhorn.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{cut! i said cut! that's a printerior}
<A>__{suddenly the reality of the horror turns into an obscene, absurd farce as what appear to be the missing parts of bodies begin wriggling out of the sand where the extras were partially buried to create the macabre effect and now the extras become whole human beings before our eyes once again.}
<L>__{43 another angle}
<A>__{the crowd reacts in various ways. sighs of relief, laughter, anger. the exhumed extras wipe sand from their eyes and shake it down their trouser legs.}
<C>__{a.d.}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{beautiful, harvey. you gave everybody a heart attack.}
<A>__{harvey, the second unit director, yells back.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{eli will hate it. he said he wanted the shot in one? now watch, he'll do six hours of pick ups.}
<A>__{the crowd disperses. a tourist turns to cameron.}
<C>__{tourist}
<D>__{great...but why do they always use so much blood? it ruins the realism, don't you think?}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(still shaken, quietly mutters)}
<D>__{...asshole...}
<A>__{the tourist stiffens as cameron turns away, his attention now drawn by the beating sound of the helicopter. he glances up.}
<L>__{44 cameron's pov}
<A>__{the helicopter is descending toward the beach while the film crew rapidly moves equipment from the last scene into piles to clear a landing site.}
<L>__{45 angle on fishing pier}
<A>__{wary of the men in the chopper, cameron is moving down the pier away from the landing site. suddenly he stops short, caught by something he sees o.s. excitedly he points and begins to shout.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{hey! hey you...!}
<L>__{46 cameron's pov}
<A>__{below him, walking away on the sand is one of the actors with the same red hair, the same old british army jacket as burt the man in the duesenberg. hearing the shout, the actor stops and tentatively turns. it's a mistake. clearly the features are different. it's not burt.}
<L>__{47 angle to include cameron}
<A>__{cameron is puzzled. he watches as the red haired actor looks about to see who called and finding no one, starts off, but is stopped by a little old lady holding a parasol and offering her autograph book.}
<C>__{little old lady}
<D>__{mr. bailey! aren't you raymond bailey, the actor? would you please sign your autograph? write 'to emily...for eternal peace.'}
<A>__{raymond signs the book with the easy charm of a man who's done it a million times. he has those special rugged good looks that belong to marlboro men and movie stars.}
<C>__{little old lady }
<D>__{i'm certainly glad you're all right. i lost my husband and my son in the wars...}
<A>__{the sound of the chopper blades has become deafening as it hovers for a landing. the old lady snatches her autograph book and heads for the landing site.}
<L>__{48 angle on helicopter}
<A>__{as it touches the ground and its doors fly open. out step the crewmen and eli cross. the assistant director rushes up and shouts over the hissing blades of the idling chopper.}

<P>__{(deeply upset)}

<D>__{i don't know...call my mother and have her tell me it wasn't my fault...}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{...what the hell could have happened?}
<A>__{their words are lost in the sound of the rotor as the chopper slowly rises. the sudden wind from its blades blows some screening off a pile of equipment. it falls on the little old lady who has been approaching eli and topples her into the surf. she is trapped in a tangle of ancient skirts and petticoats. before she can regain her balance, a wave tumbles her further into the sea.}
<L>__{49 angle including cameron}
<A>__{cameron, sitting on the edge of the pier over the water, has watched this mini disaster. the undertow from the wave has swept the old lady directly beneath him. reaching down toward her, he yells:}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{hey! hey, give me your hand!}
<A>__{he can't quite reach her. as a last resort, he drops off the edge into the water by her side.}
<L>__{50 angle on water}
<A>__{he grabs for the struggling old lady.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{don't be afraid! you're gonna be okay.}
<A>__{like groping through seaweed, he reaches past her tangled skirts, grasps her waist and lifts her to keep her head above water. she is choking, gasping for air. she turns her face toward him.}
<L>__{51 cameron's pov}
<A>__{her features are distorted; they seem to be melting away. she frees her hand and violently tears at her face, pulling away the rubber mask on which is the melting putty and make up. with it goes her wig and what is left is a startlingly beautiful young girl.}

<D>__{my god!}

<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(sputtering)}
<D>__{...franklin.}
<A>__{the sun glistens on the wet, wild young perfection of her face, ingenuously sparkling laughter and for an instant it's breathtaking a universal boyhood fantasy to suddenly be thrown this close to that kind of "movie star" beauty. it's something cameron feels in the pit of his stomach.}

<D>__{my god!...why the hell...?}
<C>__{nina}

<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i'm only old at the end of the story.}

<C>__{nina}
<D>__{oh hell, it's all ruined now and i wanted you to see the makeup, eli. where were you?...i even got raymond's autograph and he didn't know...you'd have been proud...}

<D>__{i'm sorry i was so nutty last night. i always get crazy at the end of a film.}
<A>__{nina continues picking her way toward the road. and then...}
<L>__{205 close on nina}
<A>__{suddenly she turns, running headlong, pell mell across the swamp and through the mud holes, drenching her pink pinafore into a muddy rag, losing a shoe, ripping her hose and then wildly into the arms of cameron, smearing him with love and mud! and then, just as quickly, she is gone, racing back across the field, hopping like a rabbit without her shoe, toward the road.}
<L>__{206 another angle}
<A>__{cameron is brimming with pleasure. chuck, totally ignored, picks up his stunt bag.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{lover, i think your circulation's back to normal. and please, next time will ya listen for the cue the word is "action."}
<A>__{he walks off, leaving cameron draped in the blanket like an indian. eli steps up to him looking very serious, lifts his hand in the indian sign of greeting and says:}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{"how!" i have always had a great compassion for your people. long before it was popular, i felt a repugnance for general custer.}
<A>__{cameron stares at him, incredulous.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{my god, i think he's breathing. there're days i can't do anything right. i hope this doesn't screw up our relationship, your being alive and all.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{...you sure took a hell of a chance, eli...why didn't you just let me go last night?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{what, with nina in the trunk? i've got scenes to shoot with her...}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{...all right. this morning then. chuck could have done the stunt.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{i knew a guy who made an anti war film. when they previewed it in his hometown, army enlistment went up six hundred percent. i'm making this film trying to convince the whole world that maybe there's a better way to get home for thanksgiving...and i can't even convince one dumb kid with a tattoo...i couldn't have you run around paranoid the rest of your life thinking i was trying to kill you.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{paranoid?}
<A>__{sam has run up, out of breath, followed by crew members.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{hey sam, the kid just licked your screenplay. he named the disease.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah, what?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{...a social disease, very common.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{...like gonorrhea...}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you're close. it's spread the same way...by screwing your fellow man.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i hope you find an easier cure. that was the hardest thousand bucks i ever made.}
<A>__{a horn honks. it is jake who, in his enthusiasm, has driven the police car bumping over the marshes to eli and cameron.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you guys want a ride back?}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(moving toward the helicopter)}
<D>__{no, we're goin' in the chopper.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(considers it)}
<D>__{thanks, eli, but that looks too dangerous. i think i will ride with jake. good luck with the picture.}
<A>__{he moves toward police car.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(yelling to cameron)}
<D>__{don't miss that plane, burt!}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(leaning across cameron to yell at eli)}
<D>__{he better not! any member of your company found within city limits after five o'clock tonight, gets shot on sight!}
<A>__{eli stops, suddenly registering what cameron had said.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{...what thousand bucks? that stunt paid six fifty.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{chuck told me a thousand...}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{six fifty!}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(getting upset)}

<P>__{(relenting)}
<D>__{okay, seven fifty. split the difference...}

<D>__{bullshit! you're trying to screw me!!}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{christ! you're doing it again!}
<P>__{(striding toward the chopper, shouting)}
<D>__{sam! this paranoid little bastard still doesn't understand your damn screenplay!}
<A>__{eli is climbing into the helicopter.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(shrieking)}
<D>__{that's your big problem, eli! you use people! i want my money, a thousand bucks!}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(to cameron)}
<D>__{six fifty!!}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{rewrite the battle scene and let the tank run him over! the stunt pays six fifty!}
<A>__{the helicopter takes off, zooms under the bridge, up into a hammerhead and soars back, while cameron continues to scream at it.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{come back here. i'm tired of being your goddamn clown! pay me my thousand bucks!}
<A>__{eli's voice on the helicopter's p.a. speaker echoes through the canyon, as the chopper cavorts overhead and skims away.}
