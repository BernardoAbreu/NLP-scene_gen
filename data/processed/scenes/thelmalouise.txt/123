<D>__{goddamnit! i've never been lucky! not one time!}
<A>__{louise comes back outside. she doesn't say anything. she is stoic, fighting tears.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{shit. that little sonofabitch burgled me. i don't believe it.}
<A>__{louise sits down on the sidewalk in front of the room. thelma comes and sits beside her. neither one says anything for a moment.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{louise? are you okay?}
<A>__{louise shakes her head no.}
<C>__{thelma}

<A>__{louise is still sitting on the sidewalk.}
