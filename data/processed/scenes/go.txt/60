<L>__{exterior field edge of parking lot night (rain)}
<A>__{in the distance, we hear the rumble of the music. keeping low, ronna works her way down a row, coming to mannie's car. she tries one key, then another. we look up to see todd gaines watching her from the hood of a nearby car.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{how's it going, ronna? how are sales?}
<A>__{her heart skips a beat. she drops the keys.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{todd, i can explain.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{i'm not going to ask you to.}
<A>__{he climbs off the car, approaching.}
<D>__{gaines [cont'd] the thing is, it's not like i'm in a highly ethical industry. but goddamn, ronna. you fucked me over for 20 lousy hits.}
<A>__{he pulls his gun from the back of his jeans. by instinct, she starts to move away. a red miata moves down the row behind ronna. she looks to it for help, but it's already passed.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{it's not what it looks like. i mean, it sort of is, but it's complicated.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{not really.}
<A>__{he cocks the gun.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{i know i fucked up, but i can make it up to you. please, todd.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{i'm the last fucking person you should be expecting a favor from.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{i have the cash. i have more than i owe you.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{so now you're an entrepreneur.}
<A>__{at the last moment, ronna bolts. she ducks around the corner of a van, only to see...}
<B>__{a red miata}
<A>__{doing 20 in reverse. it brakes, but there's no time. it hits her hard. she flies up over the roof of the car, crashing down on the soft top. her limp body starts to slip down the windshield, but finally sticks.}
<B>__{push in on gaines}
<A>__{seeing the hit. hearing it. stunned. a beat, then we hear the engine rev, pulling back again. that shakes ronna loose, letting her drop over the headlights in front. rolling down the slope at the edge of the field, ronna topples ass first into a drainage ditch. her body lands with a sickening thud.}
<B>__{gaines}
<A>__{stands where he is, gun still in hand, dumbfounded. he looks to the miata. it suddenly takes off, kicking up dirt and grass. for a moment, all is quiet. finally, gaines tucks the gun into his jeans. one last look around, then he starts working his way back across the parking lot. disappears.}
