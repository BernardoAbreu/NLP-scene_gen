<L>__{interior angie's building, hallway day}
<A>__{angie exits the elevator on the 3rd floor a modern, minimalist building... rick rape is with her, close behind. they come to an apartment door; rick rape pushes her, from behind, up against the door violent... her right hand slaps a palm identification sensor alongside the door and it}
<B>__{whispers open.}
<A>__{angie snaps a heel; they stumble in.}
<L>__{interior angie's apartment continuous}
<A>__{angie's place is some kind of overdecorated, schitzophrenic blend of girlie geeky porn. shafts of nicotine sunlight filter through patterned curtains. she crawls along a plush white fur rug... rick rape follows... he licks his lips an automatic gesture and begins to unbutton his pants. angie, on her hands and knees, back to him, doesn't even bother to look, until...}
<C>__{rick rape}
<D>__{urkk.}
<A>__{she turns. kable has rick rape up in the air, holding him like a barbell with one hand crushing his throat, the other his balls. he brings him down over his knee, snapping him like a broken bat kkrrunch. angie's face is passive, neutral... but her eyes are nuclear with emotion. kable tosses rick rape's broken body into the bedroom... then falls to his knees in front of angie and takes her face in his palms, gently eyes locked into hers. gorge is paralyzed.}
<D>__{gorge angie please don't kill me.}
<A>__{angie says the words, but they don't match her eyes. kable just shakes his head, trying to grasp the situation.}
<P>__{gorge angie (cont'd)}
<D>__{i will do anything.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{don't say that.}
<A>__{gorge holds out his hands; angie's fingers caress kable's chest and move toward his crotch...}
<C>__{kable }
<D>__{stop.}
<A>__{he pushes her hands away, gently.}
<C>__{kable }
<D>__{this isn't you.}
<A>__{angie's eyes well up with tears.}
<C>__{kable }
<P>__{(trying to contain his rage)}
<D>__{god damn it... you in there... controlling her... let her talk, motherfucker.}
<A>__{gorge swallows; kable is staring straight into his eyeballs.}
<D>__{gorge angie i can't.}
<A>__{kable buries his face in his hands; it's tearing him up.}
<P>__{gorge angie (cont'd)}
<D>__{she has to say what i tell her.}
<A>__{kable looks deep into angie's eyes.}
<C>__{kable}
<P>__{(almost whispering)}
<D>__{you can hear me, baby. i know you can.}
<A>__{he wipes away a tear from her cheek with his thumb. after all he's been through he begins to break down.}
<C>__{kable }
<D>__{i love you... love you... gorge angie i love you too.}
<C>__{kable}
<P>__{(snapping)}
<D>__{shut up!!!}
<A>__{he's screaming directly at gorge, who cowers in his chair as if kable were in the room with him.}
<C>__{kable }
<D>__{say anything else and i will find you... i will rip you to fucking pieces, do you understand me?}
<A>__{gorge angie nods.}
<C>__{kable }
<P>__{(to angie)}
<D>__{i'm getting you out of here.}
