<D>__{corporal guest... corporal guest... corporal guest. corporal guest, you don't have to talk to me... just please come out.}
<A>__{at last there's some real movement behind one of the holes and corporal guest crawls through one of the curtains. he neither salutes nor speaks. he blinks down at cargill, looking more like a hobo than a soldier.}
