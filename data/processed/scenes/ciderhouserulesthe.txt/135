<A>__{the radio is playing a slow, sexy dance number. the fat ladies from the apple mart are dancing as they paint the interior walls of the bunk house.}

<D>__{i am not a doctor.}
<C>__{larch }
<D>__{you know everything i know, plus what you've taught yourself you're a better doctor then i am and you know it!}
<A>__{homer is finishing up painting the kitchen walls. when he gets to the list of rules, tacked on the wall, he removes the list and finishes painting under where the rules were.}
<C>__{larch }
<D>__{they're going to replace me, homer! the board of trustees is looking for my replacement!}
<A>__{two of the ladies unroll the rolled up mattresses on the bare bedsprings, as vernon enters with an armload of blankets and pillows.}
<C>__{homer }
<D>__{i can't replace you! i'm sorry...}
<A>__{homer holds up the list of rules, rereads it briefly; he walks over to an unpainted beam, a support beam, and tacks the rules on this beam.}
