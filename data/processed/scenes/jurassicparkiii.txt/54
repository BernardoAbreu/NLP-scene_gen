<L>__{exterior jungle clearing day}
<A>__{a parasail chute is caught in the branches of a tree. a yellow life vest hangs limply from a branch. paul rushes over, unsnags it, and examines the label.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{young adult.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{eric...}
<C>__{udesky }
<D>__{hey. got something here.}
<A>__{all turn to see udesky holding up a camcorder encased in a waterproof shell.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{that's ben's!}
<A>__{she grabs it from udesky and pops open the housing. she tries the power switch on the camcorder, but the battery's dead. udesky pull out a flashlight from his pack and looks to amanda.}
<C>__{udesky}
<D>__{here, give that to me.}
<A>__{and as udesky fiddles with the flashlight, grant and billy consider the parasail.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{it looks intact.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{we should take it with us to signal any planes.}
<C>__{udesky }
<D>__{i think i've got it.}
<A>__{udesky has rigged the wires on the flashlight so that the batteries can be used to power the camcorder. he brings a live wire to back of the camcorder. a red power light comes on.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{it works!}
<C>__{udesky}
<D>__{i don't know for how long.}
<A>__{udesky swings the tiny screen out and pushes play. the others crowd around.}
<B>__{on the screeen}
<A>__{eric and ben play frisbee on the beach.}
<C>__{paul }
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{that's him. thats eric!}
<C>__{amanda }
<D>__{i filmed this the morning they left.}
<A>__{ben catches the frisbee, checks his watch and motions to eric. eric runs over, and ben puts his arm around him as they run to the camera. paul reacts to this image but holds his tongue. the video screen the image now cuts to a shot from aboard enrique's boat speeding towards isla sorna the start of the movie. eric points excitedly at the island and smiles at the camera. we replay the opening moments of the movie from ben and eric's perspective, soaring high until...}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{ben!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{unclip the line!}
<A>__{the jungle a pan from face to face of all watching this tape with a mixture of hope and nausea. on screen angle again with ben's legs in the foreground. falling fast.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{hand on! hang on buddy!}
<A>__{now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture and sound become complete chaos: screams from the both, branches breaking, flashes of ben and eric's frightened faces as the camera is buffeted in all directions. with a lurch the terrifying descent in finally over, and the jungle floor is just ten feet away, swaying back and forth beneath ben and eric's feet.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{are you ok, buddy?}
<A>__{there's gurgling to his voice. ben may be more hurt than he's letting on.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(through his sobs)}
<D>__{i don't know. i think so.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we're okay. it's going to be okay. here, get ready. i'm going to unhook you.}
<A>__{the sound of pumpling is followed by the sight of eric dropping into the frame, landing on the ground rolling. he stands and looks back up at ben.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i'm all right}
<C>__{ben }
<P>__{(weaker)}
<D>__{we're going to get out of this, pal.}
<A>__{and on that, the power and picture fade away. back on paul and amanda overjoyed.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{see? he's okay. he's alive! everything's going to be all right now.}
<A>__{amanda brings a hand to her mouth, silently nodding her head. grant and billy exchange a dubious look, than begin pulling the parasail out of the tree. as they do so, the sail gets caught on a branch. they pull harder. the branch bends, but the sail won't come loose. one last tug and than, snap. the branch breaks, the chute falls away to reveal...}
<B>__{a skeleton.}
<A>__{it swings down directly at amanda. she screams. finally, the others are able to pull her away. as they untangle the lines, the men are able to get the first view of the remains of ben hillenbrand, still caught in his harness. amanda's knees buckle. regaining her balance, she runs off into the jungle. paul quickly follows.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{amanda!}
