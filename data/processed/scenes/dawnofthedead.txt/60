<A>__{in the basement of the large building, s.w.a.t. troopers pry at the boards which are nailed over the entrance to the storage area. the rest of the riot troops stand at the ready, weapons raised... high powered rifles... flame throwers... the nails creak loudly as they are pulled free. the men are silent, not knowing what to expect. there are three boards left... then two... with a great, tearing sound, the door flies open before the men remove the last boards. the boards fly and the door almost rips off its hinges. like flood waters, a small army of zombies pushes into the hall. they are wide eyed and terrifying. in life, they were mostly blacks and puerto ricans from the neighbouring buildings. they are all ages, from the very old to the very young. the riot troops are stunned. they cannot react quickly enough, and the squeeze is so tight in the little hall that it is impossible to shoot accurately, or without the bullets injuring other troopers. the men fight back, wrestling and trying to back away. in the front line, zombies bite at the flesh of the humans. teeth tear into arms and hands. some men are trampled in the crush.}

<A>__{the rear lines retreat into the wider vestibule, and as the mass of struggling bodies spreads out, shots begin to fire. some troopers, at close quarters, are able to fire off accurate rounds with their hand guns. others fall and are lunged at by clutching ghouls. roger and the black trooper are in the middle of the battle. they fight off several of the creatures. the battle spreads into little skirmishes through the dark hallways. the highly organised troopers are scattered and confused by the mindless onslaught.}
