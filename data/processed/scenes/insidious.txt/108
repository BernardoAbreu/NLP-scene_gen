<A>__{josh sits with renai's head in his lap. she is too traumatized to speak. rain dribbles down the window pane. josh gets up when he hears the knock at the door. elise shuffles over to answer it. she opens the door to reveal lorraine, wet from the downpour. elise steps aside and lorraine walks in, gravely sedate.}
