<A>__{easter. a high view on the corleone mall in the springtime. hordes of little children including many of the corleone children and grandchilren, rush about carrying little easter baskets, searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden easter eggs. the don himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants. suddenly, he stops and looks. michael stands there, still holding his suitcase. great emotion comes over the don, who takes a few steps in michael's direction. michael leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son and embraces him.}
