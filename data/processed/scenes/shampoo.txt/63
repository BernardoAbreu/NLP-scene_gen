<L>__{interior poolhouse george and jackie}
<A>__{george has pulled a pair of cokes out of the fridge. he's looking at jackie, closes the refrigerator lamely. it opens again and he closes it again.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ do you want ice?}
<A>__{interior poolhouse lit now by lights from outside.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ no.}
<A>__{george pops the tops of the cans, hands one to jackie. neither one of them drink. they're staring steadily at each other, their eyes shining from reflections from the tennis court lights which someone has turned on.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{ we're kidding ourselves.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(staring right back)}
<D>__{ we are?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ last night i dreamt i was fifty years old and mary told me i was supposed to meet jill at the shop. it seared me shitless.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i can't imagine being with jill when she's fifty years old. i can't imagine not being with you.}
<A>__{george moves to her. jackie is waiting for him. they kiss. it is long and lingering and deliberate. george breaks away and goes to the poolhouse door. there's no lock, only an eye latch on the screen door. he latches it, tests it. it gives slightly. nevertheless he shuts the door and heads back to jackie who stands waiting.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ but what about her? i don't want to hurt jill.}
<A>__{george takes the coke out of her hand. she lets him.}
<B>__{lester}
<A>__{walks back in the foyer, holding a drink, swaying. the strobe lights are going again in the living room. suddenly he sees a girl, at least half nude, her huge painted lavender tits flashing at him through the strobe lights. the vision disturbs him greatly. he carefully steps down into the room in an effort to get near her. she seems to move. he moves after her through the lights down the length of the room, going as quickly as prudence allows. finally when they reach the end of the living room she's disappeared. then he looks out and sees her poised at the top of the steps a few yards away by the hedged path that leads down to the pool. he lunges toward the vision, and bounces off a sliding glass door.}
<B>__{jill and johnny pope}
<A>__{have made it through the entrance and pope's porsche is in sight. jill suddenly stops and looks at pope.}
<C>__{pope}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{we can't really leave that poor man here alone.}
<C>__{pope}
<D>__{ he'll never know the difference.}
<A>__{jill is clearly thinking about something else besides lester.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{ still at least we should tell him we're going. c'mon.}
<C>__{pope}
<P>__{(going along with it, protesting)}
<D>__{i'm telling you he won't know the difference.}
<A>__{by the pool lester now with a sizable bump on his head he moves with the care that only tightrope walkers and drunks can move: every step is a possible disaster.}
<C>__{twin}
<P>__{(from jacuzzi)}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{lester looks down, sees one of the twins. her arm is outstretched, her breasts dripping water visible through the shrubbery spotlights. she's holding a jointerior}
<C>__{twin }
<D>__{ it's getting soggy.}
<A>__{lester takes it.}
<C>__{the guy with her}
<D>__{ just put it on the bench over there and come on in.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{ in there?}
<C>__{the guy}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{lester takes the joint and with fierce concentration makes it over to the bench. he puts the joint down. stares at it. he looks up and there's the other twin standing beside him, nude, with her breasts visible through the towel loosely flung over her shoulders.}
<C>__{twin}
<P>__{(meaning joint)}
<D>__{could i have that?}
<A>__{lester silently hands it to her. stares at the pool and the other twin isn't there. he looks back and the one who had taken the joint is gone. he looks back to the pool and the other twin surfaces with the force of flipper, beside the guy in the pool. lester stares, then he sighs and pulls off his pants, almost falling down as he does. carrying them, he walks over to the edge of the jacuzzi.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{say }
<C>__{the guy}
<D>__{ what is it now, man?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{do you know where i can find a towel?}
<C>__{the guy}
<D>__{ the poolhouse.}
<A>__{holding his trousers, his tux shirt hanging half down over his boxer shorts, lester moves on over to the poolhouse. he tries the door. the latch creaks. he pulls at it again and the latch pops open. he starts to open the door, then hears the unmistakable sounds of a couple in the throes of intense love making. the girl is quite carried away. lester hesitates. he listens as her sighs, interspersed with fetching little sobs begin to mount in intensity. he thinks better of it. he takes his hand off the door knob and quietly closes the screen door. he starts to walk away, then notices the window on the side. he can't resist. he moves to it. he can't see anything. he moves closer. the dim, dark but classical outline of a man mounted on a woman moving with ease but increasing intensity can be seen. lester watches. the sounds are not as loud from this angle, but gradually they can be heard as the woman's cries grow louder. lester is glued to the window.}
<C>__{jill's voice}
<D>__{ there you are. les. les les les, we're leaving.}
<A>__{the angle has broadened to show lester holding his pants, not taking his face away from the window. jill and johnny pope stand beside him.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{shhh }
<P>__{(with genuine awe)}
<D>__{ now that's what i call fucking.}
<A>__{pope almost inadvertently tries to look in the window. as he does, a light begins to flood the room. it is the refrigerator door slowly opening, due in part to the rhythmic impact of the lovers transmitted through the sofa to an end table to another end table and to the refrigerator. it opens until the light shines on the upper body and face of george and jackie.}
<B>__{lester}
<A>__{who has been smiling continues to smile until the enormity of the image hits him. his face freezes. it is harsh and determined. he turns slowly away from the window and walks past jill without looking at her.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{ what }
<A>__{she turns to the window and sees george and jackie herself.}
<C>__{jill }
<P>__{(watching)}
<D>__{oh my god. oh no, oh no. oh no.}
<A>__{she turns and picks up a wrought iron end table and hurls it through the window, shattering the glass everywhere.}
<C>__{jill }
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{you son of a bitch! you bastard!}
<B>__{with george and jackie}
<A>__{george has leapt up.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{honey? where've you been? we've been looking everywhere for you.}
<A>__{jackie doesn't move, only stares wide eyed through the broken window at the screaming jill.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{oh god.}
<A>__{an ashtray is hurled into the room, smashing against the wall, and jill can be seen now storming off with pope. george, with one leg in his pants, rushes over to a far window, pulls it open.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{jill! jill! jill, goddammit!}
<A>__{he's got the pants on backwards. he turns back to jackie who has already slipped into her dress, is stuffing pantyhose into a purse.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{ jesus }
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ well you better go after her.}
<A>__{he bends down, turns his pants around, and is hopping into them.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ shit...}
<P>__{(he grabs his shirt)}
<D>__{... wait here, honey }
<A>__{he runs out of the door, beside the pool, past the jacuzzi and into the maze of hedgerows. the twins stand motionless side by side in the water.}
<C>__{twin one}
<D>__{george?}
<P>__{(to twin two)}
<D>__{who was that?}
<C>__{twin two}
<D>__{far out.}
<A>__{george, searching wildly through hedgerows, is calling jill. he can't find her. he finds himself next to a ten foot ivy covered wall. he can't reach the top. he moves along the wall... arrives at a wrought iron gate. it's locked. he peers through the gate calling frantically:}
<C>__{geroge}
<D>__{jill, honey?}
<A>__{inches from his face on the other side of the gate, the bare teeth of a huge german sheperd growl at him viciously. george chooses to go up the hedgerows toward the living room of the house. he trips and falls.}
