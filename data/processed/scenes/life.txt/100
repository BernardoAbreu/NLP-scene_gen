<A>__{cookie slowly turns the pig on a spit over an open fire. the incorrigibles are savoring a victory feast. as always, trusty guards keep an eye on things. off to the side, blocker is laughing with ray and claude. he takes a hit off ray's bottle of shine. it's not his first, either.}

<D>__{mark my words, within five years there's gonna be a colored man playing in the majors.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{come on, the world hasn't changed that much.}
<C>__{blocker}
<D>__{maybe not yet. but it will. and i will be out of a job. damn, that's some tasty hooch.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{it's amazing what ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{so, blocker, what do you think of our boy?}
<C>__{blocker}
<D>__{i think that boy could be the next josh gibson. i'm gonna talk to the front office about him, you can bet on that. damn, it's getting late. we got a game in memphis tomorrow.}
<A>__{blocker starts for his car, parked just beyond the gun line.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what about us? don't forget to mention us.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{we're like his handlers. he can't function without us.}
<C>__{blocker}
<D>__{i will put in a good word for you. you've done a good job with that boy. thanks for your hospitality.}
<A>__{ray and claude's eyes gleam with hope as blocker's car rumbles off down the road.}
