<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{what's this? garbo speaks? of course i have the hots for her and i'm doing a damn good job of keeping things platonic and professional till i kick simms' ass and show her i ain't who she thinks i am because, in fact, i am who she thinks i am but if i win the open i won't be.}
<A>__{romeo stares back at that curious logic.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{well, i don't think her nor me nor the god of golf his self can keep you from blowing up in the open...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i made it this far! i just got to hold it together for 72 more holes!}

<A>__{silence. some chagrin.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you didn't fall in love with earl to be your caddie?}

<D>__{am i special?}
<C>__{tin cup}

<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{awright... now that we got that bullshit outta the way, i'm gonna hit me some balls and start oilin' that sweet swing o' mine for the big boys...}
<A>__{romeo sits back in the shade, still washing the thousands of golf balls in the rack, watching as tin cup drops a bucket of balls on the hardscrabble ground, pulls out a club and limbers up.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{nobody heard from molly, eh?}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you got it bad, don't ya?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{somethin' about that chick...}
<A>__{tin cup addresses the ball and takes a swing. everything looks normal in his swing, but... thwock! the ball squirls off to the side and rattles against a fence. ugly.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{hmmm... little chili dipper there...}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{be sure to do that in the open.}
<A>__{unfazed, tin cup steps up to hit again, but... once more thwock! another horrible looking squib to the right. romeo stops washing balls and notices, watching tin cup. thwock, thwock! something's terribly wrong.}
<B>__{close on tin cup}
<A>__{concern crosses his face.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{romeo!}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{i'm watching.}
<C>__{tin cup}

<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{romes! something's terribly wrong. what's your guess?!}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{it's the woman.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i thought you said it was a virus?}
