<B>__{music}
<A>__{a series of quick shots of different competitors at various points in their dives. the tahitian comes up unconscious. the german comes up unconscious. so does the diver from the philippines. novelli doesn't know what to think.}

<A>__{jacques is in a t shirt and jeans, rope sole sandals. johana wears a light white cotton dress. they both sit on the restaurant's terrace overlooking the sea. below them, a small boat passes. in it are baskets filled with sponges. jacques stares at them for a long time.}

<D>__{do you ever sometimes just stop and think how sweet life can be?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{... sure.}
<A>__{johana wants to say something.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{... when you dive... with that machine... what does it feel like?}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(after thinking about it)}
<D>__{... the feeling of slipping without falling... the hardest is once you are at the bottom.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... and i always have a hard time finding one.}
<A>__{johana has never looked so sad and lost. jacques doesn't notice. enzo who is sitting at the piano behind them, starts to play, staring at the sea. jacques and johana turn around and look at him.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{... you should start playing the piano, the piano is really refreshing, it clears the sinuses. very good the piano! tomorrow is going to be a big day!}
