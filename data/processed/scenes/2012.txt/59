<L>__{interior boxing arena of mgm grand las vegas night}
<A>__{the arena is filled to its max. the crowd is on its feet.}
<C>__{boxing announcer}
<D>__{... and tonight's challenger for the heavy weight world championship of the world. here he is... mister zultan balashin!}
<A>__{the crowd roars as the boxer and his entourage enter. the camera moves in on a tall man with blonde clean cut hair. he is well built, wearing designer clothing from head to toe. yuri karpov, 45, stereotypical russian oligarch. he approaches the ringside corner and whistles.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{zultan!}
<A>__{the nervous boxer turns.}
<C>__{zultan}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{ah, finally, yuri. i thought i would not see you.}
<A>__{yuri hits the boxer's gloves. zultan is nervous. his coach steps in.}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{he needs to concentrate now, mister karpov.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{you shut up... when i talk to my boy, understand?}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{yes, mr. karpov.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{good... that is good.}
<P>__{(in russian to the boxer)}
<D>__{zultan my friend. do not forget. we are fighters. we never go down. we always stay on our feet...}
<A>__{zultan just keeps nodding, pumping himself up.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{... no matter who is hitting us. no matter how hard.}
<A>__{gong. first round. the fight is on.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{now, go kill the bastard.}
<A>__{yuri walks to his seat, sitting down next to his trophy: tamara, 28, blonde, wears the shortest mini one can imagine, designer shoes, handbag, glasses and boobs. in her lap she holds caesar, a tiny dog wearing a diamond collar. in the ring the boxers maul at each other. yuri's cell phone beeps. it's a text message:}
<B>__{start boarding procedure}
<A>__{yuri's whole demeanor changes. without a word, he gets up and walks out of the arena.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{yuri bear... where are you going?}
<A>__{yuri does not respond as he squeezes through the crowd. zultan, the boxer, notices yuri leave. in that split second distraction, he is hit hard and goes down for the count. the crowd roars!}
