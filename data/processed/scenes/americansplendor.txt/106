<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{harvey, go get me water and a few aspirin.}
<A>__{harvey just bounces back up and obeys.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{what, ya got a headache?}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{no, but i want to avoid one.}
<A>__{harvey empties the aspirin bottle in his palm. for some reason, he's feeling more comfortable.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{well lemme tell ya joyce, it sure is nice ta have company. i mean, despite all your problems, you seem like a great person. an' hey, sorry if my dating skills are kinda rusty, but i've just been through hell and back with women. i mean that last one turned out to be a real nasty bitch.}
<A>__{harvey arrives back with the aspirin. he hands it to joyce.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{i had a nice time with you, too.}
<A>__{joyce swallows the pill. harvey sits down next to her.}
<C>__{harvey}

<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{don't make people repeat themselves. it's annoying.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{oh, sorry.}
<A>__{they're inches away from each other.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{c'mere...}
<A>__{she pulls him close. harvey plants a kiss on her. they slowly separate. joyce's eyes are closed. she likes him. he kisses her again. they start making out, moaning a bit. but before it gets heavy }
<C>__{joyce}

<A>__{joyce opens her eyes. she looks uneasy.}
