<L>__{interior precinct house, hallway early morning}
<A>__{our detectives are fast asleep on the couch, leaning against each other. people pass and look at them strangely.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{wake up, glimmer twins. we have a winner.}
<L>__{interior precinct house, ready room early morning}
<A>__{a windowless classroom. the captain stands in front with a white screen at his side. the face of a black man, 25, zero, is projected on the screen from a slide projector.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{his street name is zero, as some of you know. his prints were found at the scene by detectives mills and somerset.}
<A>__{five hardened police officers, four men, one woman, sit in chairs facing the captain. they all wear bullet proof vests with "police" stencil painted across them. somerset and mills sit in back, drinking coffee, still trying to wake up.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{now, zero has a long, long history of mental illness. serious illness. he was all over your television sets two years ago after he raped and killed a seventy three year old woman. he got off, as the saying goes, on a technicality. so we watched him on the streets, and he went out of circulation about a year ago.}
<C>__{female cop}
<D>__{if he disappeared, what do you want from us?}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{his last place of residence is still in his name. a search warrant is being pushed through the court as we speak.}
<A>__{a red headed cop, california, 28, raises his meaty hand.}
<C>__{california}
<D>__{so, have the housing cops walk up and ring the doorbell. problem solved.}
<A>__{the cops laugh. the captain clenches his jaw.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{listen, california. when you go in, if zero isn't home, some of his buddies might be house sitting. and besides using, zero deals, so, you will be very uninvited guests.}
<A>__{there is chatter among the cops. somerset leans to mills while the captain continues the briefing.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{does not seem like our killer, does it?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{you tell me. i'm new in town.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{zero does possess the requisite degree of insanity... but, he doesn't have the desire somehow. our killer seems to have more purpose. more purpose than zero could ever conceive of.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{we'll tag along.}
<A>__{somerset wants no part of that.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{why would we?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{satisfy our curiosity?}
