<L>__{exterior morning moments later thunder bay}
<A>__{cowboy is in the water paddling out to get his wave. it comes and he has apparently decided to stay with what has gotten him this far; a conservative style that keeps him looking good without falling. his ride is similar to the last one, but even more graceful and lyrical and he gets a 9.}

<P>__{(to robbie)}
<D>__{looks like he's waiting for you to make a mistake. you sure you know what you're doing?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i'm just making this up as i go along.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{works for me! go get 'em.}
<A>__{robbie appears on the seawall holding his board and looking out first at the bay, then at the crowd. his mom, connie waves, and he smiles weakly. he sees katie and she looks hopeful. she hasn't given up on him completely. he smiles at her and gets into the water. he begins paddling. it seems to take forever for him to get out to the spot where he catches the wave, but he finally arrives. he sits there for a moment, collecting himself, then raises his hand to signal he is ready. the concessions kids have started to chant, robbie! robbie! the guards are anxious, but even they can't help moving to the cadence of the chant. the wave comes and he catches it quickly, and slips his feet into the duct tape pockets. he misses one pocket at first, then gets it in. he rides it carefully and at the right moment slides up to the top and executes a full 360 degree turn out of the water. on landing back on the downside of the wave, he slides down it quickly, and then turns around with a deep cut and heads straight into the wave. at the top he bounces and does a complete back flip in slow motion. we see the crowd also in slow motion. aokee is covering his eyes, he can't watch. alex's face is contorted with disbelief. various faces in the crowd are in open mouthed disbelief. the judges are staring intently, focussed so as not to miss anything. robbie lands the flip, and rides the rest of the wave. he waves to the crowd, and kicks off, exhausted. the place goes nuts. no one here has ever seen anything like this before. aokee and alex run into the water and help him out. people are still cheering. cowboy knows he's in trouble. the judges confer only momentarily and the score 10 appears, and the word concessions starts flashing along with the word winner. cowboy nods in agreement. tiffany says something to him, and he appears angry. we can only hear part of his response, something like:}
<C>__{cowboy}
<P>__{(disbelief)}
<D>__{you did what?}
<A>__{aokee and alex lead him up to the grandstand. cowboy also makes his way up there, and we see him talking to big mike. big mike nods in agreement and cowboy goes to the mike as the crowd settles down.}
<C>__{cowboy }
<D>__{as last year's surfer king, it's my privilege to present this year's trophy to the most amazing surfer on the water today. robbie! congratulations.}
<A>__{cowboy shakes robbie's hand, and robbie speaks at the mike.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(holding trophy)}
<D>__{i just want to thank aokee, alex and katie for all their support.}
<A>__{we see katie clapping, crying. aokee and alex are clapping and smiling.}
<C>__{robbie }
<D>__{and i have just one thing to say to everyone in concessions. we did it!}
<A>__{robbie holds the trophy high as everyone cheers.}
