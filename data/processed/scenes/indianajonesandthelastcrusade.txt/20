<B>__{the deck of a portuguese cargo ship}
<A>__{it's night. rain pours down. we're in the middle of a violent storm at sea. thirty foot waves crash across the deck. the two portuguese sailors (who have indy's arms pinned behind his back) propel indy across the deck toward the rail. as they pass a bundle of fuel drums, indy uses the two sailors as leverage to kick up his feet and break open the clamp on the metal bands that hold the drums together. indy jabs his elbows into the stomachs of the startled sailors and rushes toward the man in the panama hat. panama hat sees indy coming and hurries toward the ladder that leads up to the bridge. indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes his way to where panama hat is climbing the ladder. he pulls him off the ladder from behind the two men fall down on the deck. indy takes the cross back from panama hat. a sailor delivers a powerful blow to indy's face, sending the cross flying out of his grip and skittering across the deck. indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two sailors who attack him from the sides. indy sees that the cross is about to be swept overboard. he lunges for it. he snatches up the cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave. he struggles to his feet, managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the deck around him. several more drums come indy's way. he sidesteps them all.}

<D>__{grab him, he's getting away! grab him!}
<A>__{indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. indy sees a large stevedore's hook above him and he climbs up on crates to reach it. he grabs a hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly avoiding a huge wave behind him. he jumps into the rollicking ocean, still holding onto the cross. on the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly onto a crate of tnt. the crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, sending an enormous orange fireball into the sky. long shot the boat exploding out of the water as bits of debris fall from the sky like rain.}
<B>__{indy bobs up}
<A>__{in the water amid the debris, holding the cross in his hand. he grabs for something to keep him afloat. it turns out to be one of the ship's life preservers. indy loops his arm through the preserver. only now do we see the faded lettering on the preserver revealing the destroyed ship's name and city of port:}
