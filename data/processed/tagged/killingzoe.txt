<L>__{interior taxi cab moving day}
<A>__{rain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi zone of the charles de gualle airport. aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the cab we hear the sounds of the airport: the almost monotonic loudspeaker declaring in french that loitering is not permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get their bearings. inside the cab, playing on the radio, is angelique kidjo's funky song "batonga". then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an extreme close up we see zed, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red hair. his face has drops on it from the flurry outside. he settles himself, then looks to the cab driver, an easy going senegalese frenchman, in the front seat.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{hotel mondial.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{le mondial. tres bien.}
<A>__{he starts driving.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un moment. l'autoroute est ferme. a cause du 14 juillet.}
<A>__{he drives for a while.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{[do you mind the radio?]}
<A>__{zed looks at the meter, francs are clicking away. he also looks at the cab driver's license, his name is moises du bois.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{[do you want me to turn the radio off?]}
<C>__{zed}
<P>__{(realizing he's being asked a question)}
<D>__{i don't speak french.}
<A>__{the driver turns around.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<P>__{(in broken english)}
<D>__{ah. american?}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{that's good because i speak a little english.}
<A>__{zed nods.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{i asked if you mind the radio. music. you know.}
<A>__{zed shakes his head "no".}
<C>__{cab driver}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{super cool.}
<A>__{zed adjusts his watch.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{time, time, time. i don't know. daytime.}
<A>__{zed forgets the adjustment for now.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{are you in town for business?}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{it's a nice hotel. your hotel. very big rooms.}
<A>__{he looks at zed in the rear view mirror.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{do you know paris?}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{i've been here once before. when i was younger.}
<A>__{the cab driver smiles.}

<D>__{those were the days.}

<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{married?}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{do you have a wife?}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(then after thinking about it for a while)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{well, if you need a wife for the night...}
<P>__{(searching for the right words in french)}
<D>__{une escorte. pour vous faire visiter.}
<P>__{(then back to his broken english)}
<D>__{for business. i give you my number. very nice girl. french. like when you were young.}
<A>__{he lifts his hand and shows his index and middle finger tightly extended together, then he crosses them.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{know what i mean?}
<A>__{zed smiles at this and nods.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{speaks the language of love. take you to heaven and back. you just tell me and i set it up.}
<A>__{zed shakes his head and laughs.}
<C>__{cab driver}
<D>__{what you laughing at? you let moises set it up. she treat you right. she treat you fine.}
<A>__{zed can do nothing but smile at the thought of it.}

<L>__{interior hotel hall day}
<A>__{a long, empty hallway of a moderately priced hotel. from around a corner comes a bellboy carrying zed's one bag. zed is right behind him. they come up to room 6a and the bellboy unlocks the door.}
<L>__{interior hotel room day}
<A>__{the door to the room opens and the bellboy, followed by zed, walks into the room. he puts zed's bag onto one of those luggage holders and proceeds to show him the room. sitting on the bed is a large air freight package.}
<C>__{bellboy}
<P>__{(in broken english)}
<D>__{your package...it arrived in the last night of before last night.}
<A>__{he points to the telephone.}
<C>__{bellboy}
<D>__{ah...telephone, for the room service.}
<A>__{he motions toward the bathroom.}
<C>__{bellboy}
<D>__{the toilet.}
<A>__{he opens the closet door.}
<C>__{bellboy}
<D>__{to hang the clothes.}
<A>__{he points to a control console next to the bed.}
<C>__{bellboy}
<D>__{from here you can operate the television.}
<A>__{then he pauses at the door before he goes out. zed reaches into his pocket and takes out some french money, he starts fingering through it. then, the bellboy takes the liberty of showing zed which bills to give him.}
<C>__{bellboy}
<P>__{(after getting what he wanted)}
<D>__{merci.}
<A>__{he starts to leave.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{oh, wait.}
<A>__{the bellboy turns around.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{bellboy}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{zed}
<P>__{(pointing at his watch)}
<D>__{time.}
<C>__{bellboy}
<D>__{ah. yes. il est presque huit heures moins dix.}
<A>__{the bellboy clicks his heels and walks out the door. zed looks around the room, still wondering what time it is, and takes a seat on the bed. obviously tired from the flight zed unbuttons his shirt a bit and lays back on the bed next to the package. before he dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on the bedside table. he is asleep.}
<T>__{fade to black:}
<L>__{interior hotel room later day}
<A>__{zed's bed, while still made, looks like it's been slept in. sitting on it is the ripped open air freight package. inside of it is a black steel briefcase. the shower is on and from the look of things zed is in it. on the bedside table we see zed's watch. it reads 12:10 p.m. next to it is the phone. next to the phone is a piece of folded paper with moises' name and a phone number that reads:}
<L>__{45.63.53.37. interior hotel room bathroom shower day}
<A>__{zed is in the shower letting the water run directly into his face and cascade down his body. he opens his mouth and freely drinks the water, then he spits some out with a spurt. then he stops, attentive, listening for something. he turns the shower off. then he hears it again, the knocking on the door.}
<L>__{interior hotel room bathroom day}
<A>__{zed grabs a towel and climbs out of the shower. he makes his way toward the knocking.}
<L>__{interior hotel room day}
<A>__{zed walks to the door to his room with the towel wrapped around his waist. he opens it. in the hall is zoey, a cute french girl of not more than twenty. she's chewing on gum the way a schoolgirl might, but she looks like no girl zed ever went to school with.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{bonjour.}
<C>__{zed}
<P>__{(a little awkwardly)}
<D>__{bonjour.}
<A>__{zed opens up the door and lets her in. she checks out the room and places her bag on the bed. then she makes her way to the window for a view of the city.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{wow. vous avez une belle chambre. je ne suis jamais venue dans cet hotel.}
<A>__{she turns to him, but in the process takes the time to examine every detail of the room.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{ca sera 150 francs de l'heure. toute la nuit pour 700. d'avance. et faudra porter un }
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{i...don't speak french.}
<A>__{she blows a bubble.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<A>__{she takes a seat on the bed.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{it will be one thousand francs for all night. in advance.}
<A>__{zed takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{we can do it now if you want.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{well, let me just dry up.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{okay, but it's not necessary.}
<A>__{he goes into the bathroom and starts drying himself. she puts the money in her bag and then turns on the television from the remote console. a french talk show comes on. she changes the channel until she comes to a station playing f.w. murnau's silent classic, "nosferatu". she smiles and sits back to watch.}
<C>__{zed}
<P>__{(from the bathroom)}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{zoe or zoey. which ever you like.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{my name's zed.}
<C>__{zoey}
<P>__{(smiling at this)}
<D>__{that's funny. we both have z names.}
<A>__{zed comes walking out of the bathroom drying his hair. his pants are on.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{what was that?}
<A>__{she notices his pants.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{you can take those off. the pants.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{i'd rather watch you get undressed first.}
<C>__{zoey}
<P>__{(matter of factly)}
<D>__{alright.}
<A>__{she stands up and starts to lift her top off. he stops her.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{slower.}
<A>__{he lays down on the bed. she stands there looking at him and then smiles.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{alright mister america. zed.}
<A>__{then, with zed laying on the bed and watching her, she slowly, seductively strips in front of him, never taking her eyes from his eyes, until she is totally naked.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{slow enough for you?}
<A>__{then, like a cat prowling for it's prey, she crawls over the bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants. she removes the pants and climbs on top of him. they begin to make love. on the television, "nosferatu" silently plays. zoey and zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't resist during a moment of passion. she cries out and lowers herself to his grasp. an image overcomes her mind. they quicken to an almost violent speed and then expire, both satisfied. she begins to kiss him multiple times over the face.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{c'etait formidable.}
<A>__{she rolls over, still hugging him, purring like a kitten. they rest there for a while...holding each other.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{i'm cold.}
<A>__{she takes the covers and crawls under them, so does zed.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{zed?}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{moises told me you were in town for business.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{what kind of business?}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm just curious.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{do you ask all your clients questions?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{no. just the ones i like.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{so you like me?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{because you're...a good person. i run into some real creeps. you know.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{how do you know i'm a good person?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{body language. we fit together.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{all men and women fit together. hell, even some men fit together.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{no, but you know, we clicked. you made me orgasm. do you know how often i orgasm with a man moises sets me up with?}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{no i don't.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{usually never. they're almost always fat like pigs.}
<A>__{zed laughs at this.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{and you make me feel safe. that's something more important than the orgasm. an integral part maybe of the orgasm.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{i never really thought of it like that.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{well, it's true.}
<A>__{zed nods at this.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{turn off the television.}
<A>__{zed reaches over and turns it off from the console.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{so i mean it when i tell you zed, i like you very much.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{well, i like you too zoe.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{honest?}
<A>__{he nods.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{why? for the same reason? any man can orgasm. even with his own hand.}
<A>__{zed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{well, i like your honesty. you're open. unlike most prostitutes i've been with.}
<A>__{she doesn't like the sound of this. she slaps him.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{i am not a prostitute!}
<A>__{zed is a little surprised at this.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{really? can i have my francs back then?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{i'm a student. and to pay for the classes i became an escort. it's my choice to sleep with you.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{what? you don't understand.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{no, i do.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{hey, it's not easy.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{i didn't say it was.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{i'm here because i want to.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{okay, okay relax. what school do you go to?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{the centre du art, paris.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{that's really interesting. what kind of art do you study?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{not any of the old shit.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{i have a day job too. three times a week.}
<A>__{she rolls onto her back and stares into an imaginary world as she talks to zed.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{but someday there will be only my art.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{what kind of things do you paint?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{i don't painterior i make things. objects. not like sculpture. like life...but with no narrative. i want when someone looks at one of my objects for there to be no reference to the world. void of feeling, emotion...void of destiny. those are left for me. they belong only to me. if someone else can see into it...then it is no longer mine. i have failed. and i would destroy it. i don't care how much cash they would offer me. it would be shit. i can't tell you how many objects of mine have been destroyed. they told too much about me. and if someone wants to know something about me...i will tell them myself. the way i'm telling you.}
<A>__{she looks back at him.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{what i do i do only for the objects.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{i'd like to see one of these.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{what? so you could see the work of a whore?}
<A>__{he decides to put a stop to this once and for all.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{zoey. i'm sorry for calling you a prostitute. i didn't understand the difference.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{the difference is a prostitute would have lied to you about her orgasm.}
<A>__{he gives her a kiss.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{if these things you make are as true as you are...i'm sure they're as indescribable. perhaps, someday, you'll make one...about me.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{if i do...you'll never know which one it is. because i will be the only one who understands. i will be the only one who can look into it and see where in my life it came from.}
<A>__{zed is unable to speak. they look into each others eyes for a long moment, hearing the sounds of the city drift in through the window. then she leans forward and gives him a soft understanding kiss.}
