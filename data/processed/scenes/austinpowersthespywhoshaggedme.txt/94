<C>__{austin}
<D>__{why don't you just shag fat bastard again?}
<C>__{felicity}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{austin, that is it! i don't know what happened to you in the nineties, but i'm still here, in the sixties, and i still swing! don't try to lay your hang ups on me just because you lost your mojo! that one hurts.}

<D>__{ouch, baby, very ouch. i'm wounded.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{i'm sorry, austin, that was a cheap shot.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{no, baby, you're right. i was wrong to judge you. i guess i am... jealous.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{but the austin powers i knew was wild and crazy and free. he could never be jealous.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{that austin is gone. i've changed. i knew someone, not long ago, a very special woman. she taught me that life isn't about jumping into the sack with whoever comes along, it's about caring and responsibility. and while it is true she turned out to be an evil robot minion of dr. evil, i suppose i really did... love her.}

<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{listen, austin, i can't pretend to understand everything you've gone through, but i trust you. i will make you a deal: if we get out of here alive, i will give monogamy a try.}

<D>__{with me?}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{yes, silly.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{groovy, baby!}
<A>__{they kiss.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{we need to lure the guard inside and get his key.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{alright, what if i pretend to be desperately ill with food poisoning? the guard, drawn by my cries of pain, will come to investigate. meanwhile, you dig a pit and line it with makeshift punji sticks made from sharpened toothbrushes. the guard falls in, bob's your uncle, and we've got the key. what do you think?}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{that might work, but how about this?}
<A>__{felicity charges towards the window in the door, ripping open her blouse as she goes, showing her breasts to the guard. we, however, can't see them.}
