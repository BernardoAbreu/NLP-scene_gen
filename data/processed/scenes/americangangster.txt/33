<A>__{as richie leaves alone, he's aware of all the eyes on him knowing the other cops' looks don't signify awe or respect, but contempt and fear, like rivera predicted. neither will ever be trusted again. he climbs into his car, drives off.}
<L>__{interior diner harlem day}
<A>__{tango and his bodyguard come in and approach frank's table where he reads the morning paper as he eats breakfast.}
<C>__{tango}
<D>__{didn't you see the jar, frank? i think you walked right past it.}
<A>__{frank ignores him, forks at his eggs, eats. tango sits.}
<C>__{tango}
<D>__{the money jar. on the corner. what i got to do, put a sign on it?}
<A>__{frank indicates that he would answer if his mouth wasn't full. he swallows finally, but then only reaches for his coffee cup to take a sip, further irritating tango.}
<C>__{tango}
<D>__{bumpy don't own 116th street no more, frank. bumpy don't own no real estate in harlem no more. i'm the landlord now and the lease is twenty percent.}
<A>__{frank dabs at his mouth with a napkin and gives tango a look that says that won't be happening.}
<C>__{tango}
<D>__{then don't sell dope, frank. get a fuckin job. you need a job? you can be my driver, drive me around, open my door, yes, sir, no sir, where to, sir, right away, massa johnson, sir.}
<A>__{right now tango is dead. no doubt about it. on the surface, though, frank remains cool.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{twenty percent?}
<C>__{tango}
<D>__{of every dollar. every vig, every truckload, every girl, every ounce. in the jar.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{twenty percent's my profit. if i'm giving it to you then what am i doing? twenty percent puts me, and everyone you know, out of business, which puts you out of business.}
<P>__{(reaches for his breakfast check)}
<D>__{there are ways to make money legitimately, and then there's this way. not even bumpy took twenty percent.}
<C>__{tango}
<D>__{bumpy's fuckin dead.}
<A>__{frank regards tango a moment, gets up, takes out his money clip, covers the check on the table with a five, peels off a $1 bill from the clip, tosses it down in front of tango.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{there. that's twenty percent.}
<A>__{as he turns and leaves, tango watches after him ...}
