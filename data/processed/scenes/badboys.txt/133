<L>__{exterior grungy trailer park day}
<A>__{burnett and lowrey park and pop the trunk. inside are guns and uniforms.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{what are we gonna be today? postal inspectors or water and power?}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{water and power.}
<L>__{exterior trailer day}
<A>__{approaching are burnett and lowrey, but now they're dressed in shorts and t shirts with bright orange vests and caps reading "water and power." and as lowrey knocks on the door.}
<B>__{close on heavy link chain}
<A>__{wrapped around a pink refrigerator. it moves.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{what do you think the chain's for?}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{i dunno. maybe some kind of hurricane anchor.}
<A>__{they knock again. the chain jerks slightly.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{well, the anchor just moved.}
<A>__{both turn and look. and the chain is moving. at first, it simply sways back and forth, then it pulls taut and the fridge jolts! a deep, guttural noise sounds. from around the corner, a shadow grows large. lowrey and burnett instinctively withdraw their guns and aim just as a lion rounds the corner, teeth bared, claws tearing at the deck. the door swings open. burnett pushes lowrey inside just as the big cat lunges.}
