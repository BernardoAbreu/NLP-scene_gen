<A>__{shooting through the albert memorial as a foreground piece we see the activities of the arrivals at a big concert. through the archway large limousines are pulling up, while on the sidewalk level with the main road odd taxis are pulling in. we see the usual line of posters which run along the edge of the sidewalk.}

<A>__{the screen is filled with a large poster. it announces for that evening the commemorative concert. further details on the poster indicate that a cantata will be sung featuring the london symphony orchestra, the royal choral society, and a name woman as featured mezzo soprano, and conductor bernard herrmann. between the camera and the poster a taxi pulls up. it is near enough to the camera so that just the driver and the door fills the screen, jo mckenna steps out the far side and pays off the driver with a ten shilling note. she hurries away. the driver endeavors to call after her as he turns the note around in his hand. he looks at it with satisfaction, and stuffs it into the inner recesses of his clothes.}
