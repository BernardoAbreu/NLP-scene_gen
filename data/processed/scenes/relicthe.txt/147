<A>__{the monster is now half way up the wall. margo is distraught, crying. her cool demeanor is cracked. pendergast is with her. she shakes her head.}

<A>__{pendergast raises a high powered rifle with a laser sight. he aims the red laser beam directly at mbwun's left eye.}

<D>__{he has to look here or i won't get a clear shot. call him, margo.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i can't!}
<C>__{pendergast}

<A>__{margo takes a moment, her eyes streaming. she has no choice, she calls out.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{john! john, look at me!}
<A>__{the beast looks down, sees pendergast's rifle. there's a long, awful, moment. suddenly it emits a sound like a wail. on jonathan... staring, stunned. pendergast... steady... margo... she's crying as she raises her arm as if to say good bye. and the gun explodes. on mbwun... its head shoots back in pain, and it falls... sixty feet straight down to the ground. silence. thunder rolls. it's over. pendergast turns to margo and quietly folds her in his arms.}
