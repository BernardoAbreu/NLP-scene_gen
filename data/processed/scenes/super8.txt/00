<A>__{over black we hear the dull sounds of industry; a muffled mass of machines, gears, steam. fade in on: a sign. twelve feet across. painted decades earlier, grim covered black, white and red. it reads in large 40's era, hand painted type, "safety is our primary concern!" then: "days since last accident" and below that, numbers, painted on hanging metal cards. four possible digits can hang here, but there are currently three: "784." slowly push in on this sign as a man appears, rising on a forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit. removes the "4" from its hooks. then removes the "8." then the "7." finally, he hangs up a number. "1." the man lowers out of frame as we creep even closer to the hanging single digit, wondering about the accident... and how bad it was and the factory sounds grow deafening and as it builds to a crescendo, we cut to silent blackness:}
