<L>__{exterior zook farm lancaster county day}
<A>__{big shot... it's early morning as the amish buggies are arriving at the zook farm for a barn raising. in the b.g. we can see big stacks of lumber all around the construction site where a couple of dozen men have begun raising the main supports on the already laid foundation. elsewhere, long tables have been set up and women are spreading them with cloths, setting out big tanks of hot coffee and cold lemonade for the men,}
<B>__{lapp buggy}
<A>__{as eli, book, rachel and samuel step down, book eyes the construction site.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{wait here 'til i find a gang you can work with.}
<A>__{he goes. book glances around as even more buggies arrive and more workmen and their families climb out. eli appears with hochstetler in tow. hochstetler's broad face breaks into a grin:}
<C>__{hochstetler}
<D>__{book! good to see you!}
<A>__{he pumps book's hand with his usual vigor, smiling a greeting and pleasantry to rachel. she looks on, amused. hochstetler gives rachel a look, and we realize that his showing up just now to appropriate book was no happenstance. and book realizes it as well.}
<C>__{hochstetler}
<D>__{eli says you're a carpenter, book.}
<C>__{book}
<D>__{it's been a while.}
<C>__{hochstetler}
<D>__{no matter. come with me. we can always use a good carpenter.}
<A>__{with that he throws a huge arm around book's shoulder and ushers him away. rachel calls after them:}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{good luck.}
<A>__{book hochstetler as they move off.}
<C>__{hochstetler}
<D>__{your hole is healed, then?}
<C>__{book}
<P>__{(gives him a look)}
<D>__{pretty much.}
<A>__{hochstetler nods with satisfaction:}
<C>__{hochstetler}
<D>__{good. then you can go home.}
