<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you know, it's at times like this, when i'm trapped in a vogon airlock with a man from betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that i really wish i'd listened to what my mother told me when i was young.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{why? what did you she tell you?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i don't know. i didn't listen.}
<A>__{ford folds his towel into a tiny square, holds it up toward arthur. he raises an eyebrow. will this help?}
