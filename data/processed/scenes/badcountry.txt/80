<L>__{interior diner day}
<A>__{greasy spoon, soul food jointerior trucker and labor patrons. bud walks in, perplexed to find braddock sitting with martin fitch (30), deputy chief of staff for us attorney general. pressed suit. young face. out of his element.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{hey, mike.}
<C>__{braddock}
<D>__{bud, this is special agent, martin fitch. he's down from washington. with the attorney general.}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{martin. just call me martin.}
<A>__{fitch offers his hand, smiles. bud shakes.}
<C>__{braddock}
<D>__{martin's gonna be soliciting jesse's case for a federal sponsor.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{how long you been with the attorney general, fitch?}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{just over a year.}
<A>__{bud looks at braddock.}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{i want to assure you my education and experience is more than adequate to handle a case of this potential.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{is that right...}
<A>__{fitch's smile drops as bud stares him down.}
<C>__{braddock}
<D>__{why don't we get to the particulars?}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{right. alright.}
<P>__{(clears throat)}
<D>__{to get jesse a federal sponsor, we need something substantial. a bait. in the justice department, we have this mission statement... we decide who the target is, what's the threat assessment, the cost value, over what time table it's gonna take place... which target do we go after first. we don't want to miss a big target hitting a smaller target, you understand?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{well, exposing bodies has limitations. those people are dead. we can't retrieve their lives.}
<A>__{bud blinks.}
<C>__{braddock}
<D>__{he means there might not be enough to back jesse.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{keep him on the street without protection, he winds up dead.}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{what i'm saying is, we need fresh leads. he'll need to present something that separates him from those we're going to arrest. if jesse can't offer something continuous... i'm afraid we can't be of much help.}
<A>__{bud stares at fitch. a waitress in her 50s approaches.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{ready to order?}
<C>__{fitch}
<P>__{(cuts in)}
