<A>__{sofya in her bed. a team of doctors hover over her. one of them peers into her eyes with a sextant like instrument. we move into the hall to find dr. rossolimo, an expert in mental illness, conferring in the hall with tolstoy and dushan.}
<C>__{rossolimo}
<D>__{i believe the countess suffers from a mental degeneracy, paranoic and hysterical, chiefly the former.}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the doctor walks back into the bedroom. tolstoy red in the face, walks away down the hall. dushan catches him.}
