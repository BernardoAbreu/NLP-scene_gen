<C>__{cates}
<D>__{don't worry about it.}

<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i can see that. pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit. what happened?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{we and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...}
<A>__{hammond looks at her. he nudges cates.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{who the hell are you?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{name's hammond, reggie hammond. i heard a lot about you. and any friend of jack's is a friend of mine.}
<A>__{gives her a big smile.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i'm not so sure i can say the same thing...you don't look like a cop.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{well, i been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years. and you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{shrink major, not a shrink.}
<A>__{she pours three glasses of cognac. a straggler at the end of the bar pipes up.}
<C>__{straggler}
<D>__{hey, lady, a drink here.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{we're closed.}
<C>__{straggler}
<D>__{hey, what the hell?}
<A>__{elaine turns to him; it's short and sweet.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{drink your drink, pay up and get out.}
<C>__{straggler}
<D>__{you can't do this. it's against...}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{hey, just fuck off. my friends have guns.}
<A>__{cates holds up his pistol. the man's eyes widen and he turns his angry move toward her into a skedaddle out of the bar. elaine finishes drying a glass and approaches.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you real down?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i've been better...dead end. no ganz, no indian.}
<A>__{he finishes his drink, puts down the glass.}
<C>__{cates}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i gotta call the station.}
<A>__{looks back at hammond...}
<C>__{cates}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't run off anywhere, okay? i've already got enough to worry about.}
<A>__{moves away.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{hard man to live with.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{how would you know?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{hey, two days with him is enough.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{that's no bull.}
<A>__{she looks at him carefully. they both grin.}
<B>__{cates}
<A>__{in the phone booth.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{is there any report ... no ... just tell me... nothing..yeah i figured... okay, sure.}
<A>__{hangs up.}
<B>__{elaine and hammond}
<A>__{cates returns...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{nothing. no sign of ganz. no sign of the indian. airport's clean. train station. bus station. docks... shit...}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{ganz is going to be hard to track. just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... the indian... himself... anybody...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{jack, it's all over the papers. he's an obvious type. but this indian...}
<A>__{hammond cuts in.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{he was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... he was loyal, went all the way for you...}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{in all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me. the kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend. have you two ace detectives checked that out?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{yeah, well the only woman of the indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend. i guess she went with him before she came outta the closet ... they both looked mad enough to kill him...}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{yeah, too bad. they were real nice lookin' too...in bed together, hardly any clothes one watching tv...}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{what makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions. i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week, jack, and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian ... now, if this indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{when a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{hey, come on, shrink time's over. they wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{she's got a point there, jack.}
<A>__{smiles. cates reflects for a moment.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{it's the only thing we got.}
<A>__{he looks at elaine.}
<C>__{cates}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{whaddya think?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{what do i know? i'm just a bartender.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{let's go, reggie.}
<A>__{he kisses elaine.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{do i get to kiss her too?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{if she's right, and if you don't screw up.}
<A>__{they exit the bar.}
