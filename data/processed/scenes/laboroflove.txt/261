<A>__{three people in the elevator; stephanie, dr. maurice parker, and a female physician. the female doctor looks at maurice curiously, studying his demeanor she can't place him. the elevator doors open on the third floor... the sound of a tv floods the elevator compartment. maurice looks up in horror to see a close up of his face superimposed on the tv screen seated on the receptionist's desk. a man gets on the elevator. the female doctor stares at the tv as the doors close she immediately turns to maurice... her view is blocked by the new passenger... the elevator progresses down 2... 1... the female doctor leans forward trying to get a glimpse of maurice... the bell dings as the doors open on the ground floor. doctor maurice parker and stephanie quickly exit... the female doctor stays in the elevator and watches carefully.}
