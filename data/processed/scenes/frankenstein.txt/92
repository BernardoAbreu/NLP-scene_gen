<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{int victor's bedroom night}
<A>__{victor lies sleeping. wrestling with troubled dreams. in an eerie echo of before: the door creaks open in a spill of light. a shadow enters, creeps to the bed, falls across his face. victor's eyes fly open. he tries to erupt from bed, choking on a scream... and henry wrestles him back to the pillow to feel his clammy forehead.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{thank god your fever broke.}
<P>__{(offers him water)}
<D>__{slowly, now. just a sip.}
<P>__{(victor sips, falls back)}
<D>__{i've been worried we might lose you. it's been touch and go for a week.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{a... week?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{we feared cholera. turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{is that your diagnosis?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{mine and professor krempe's.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{we've been trading off nursing you in shifts. the rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. it's his turn for that just now.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you've been going round the clock?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{we catch a few hours sleep where we can. usually here at your bedside.}
<C>__{victor}
<P>__{(deeply moved)}
<D>__{everything in moderation, clerval.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{nothing in moderation, frankenstein.}
<A>__{victor takes henry's hand. squeezes it.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{it's the down and outs i pity most. those who can't fend for themselves. they'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. they don't stand a chance out there.}
<C>__{victor}
<P>__{(thinking of his creation)}
<D>__{no. they don't.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{victor. this place looked like a charnel house. what went on here?}
<A>__{victor pauses, too emotional to respond. softly:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i want to go home.}
<A>__{beat. henry accepts this, though he doesn't like it.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{it'll be months before you're well enough. meantime, your family must be frantic not hearing from you.}
<A>__{henry grabs a stack of letters from the nightstand.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i found these. some of the postmarks go back nine months.}
<P>__{(slaps them on the bed)}
<D>__{why don't you open them? and when you've the strength, have the decency to ease their minds with a reply. soon as the city ends quarantine, i will even mail it for you. along with this.}
<P>__{(raises the locket)}
<D>__{it's a beautiful gift. does her no good lying here.}
<A>__{henry leaves him alone to wrestle with his guilt. victor is swept with emotion and remorse. he closes his eyes. softly:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{it can't survive.}
