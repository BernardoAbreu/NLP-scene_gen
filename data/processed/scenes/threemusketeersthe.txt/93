<L>__{exterior river and ferry landing day}
<A>__{the ferry is an open flatboat a wooden platform, about fifteen by twenty feet. it travels from one shore to the other by means of a ferry rope. transport is slow, the trip to the other shore takes nearly five minutes. as porthos and aramis arrive, the flatboat is just returning, piloted by its ferryman, a hunched and weatherbeaten gnome. four passengers wait to be carried across two gentleman cavaliers on horseback, and a country woman and her child. as the flatboat enters its slip, the two cavaliers urge their horses on board, rudely jostling the woman and her child to the rear. the ferryman, an experienced boot licker, bows and scrapes to the cavaliers, collects the coins they toss to his way.}
<C>__{ferryman}
<D>__{a privilege to carry you on my humble boat...}
<A>__{the ferryman turns a greedy eye on the woman and child.}
<C>__{ferryman}
<D>__{two pistoles.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{but i only have one. couldn't my child ride free? she's so small...}
<C>__{ferryman}
<P>__{(hand outstretched, demanding)}
<D>__{two pistoles.}
<A>__{a courtly voice intervenes.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{put away your money, madame. you and your child will cross the river under our protection. for free.}
<A>__{all turn to regard aramis on horseback, porthos at his side. the woman reacts with grateful surprise. the ferryman is outraged, spittle flies as he curses and protests.}
<C>__{ferryman}
<D>__{nobody rides for free! under your protection bloody well indeed! i will teach you a thing or two about protection! apple cheeked young fools!! just who do you think you are!!}
<C>__{aramis}
<P>__{(waits for the}
<D>__{tirade to cease;}
<P>__{simply)}
<D>__{musketeers.}
<A>__{two two cavaliers react to the word. the ferryman does, too into cringing, obedient servant.}
<C>__{ferryman}
<D>__{musketeers? well, why didn't you say so? of course you'll ride for free. i insist on it. this way, pretty madame. my what a lovely little girl...}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{porthos!}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{aramis takes porthos by the shoulder and turns him so he can see their pursuers pouring over the top of the hill on their horses.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{we sail!}
<A>__{and with that, porthos takes the sharp edge of his boomerang and brings it down on the dock rope. the rope splits and the ferryboat lurches away from the dock.}
<B>__{hill and shore}
<A>__{the pursuers charge down the hill and ride to the end of the dock but they're too late. porthos and aramis have gotten away.}
<B>__{flatboat}
<A>__{porthos laughs and taunts the angry pursuers. aramis ties scarves around the horses' eyes to blindfold them for the crossing. then he turns around and sees what aramis is already seeing the two cavaliers watch them with keen interest.}
<C>__{first cavalier}
<D>__{you're those musketeers everyone's been looking for.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{popularity has its price.}
<A>__{the first cavalier smiles, produces a flask.}
<C>__{first cavalier}
<D>__{i have some excellent brandy here. would you gentlemen care to drink a toast with us to the cardinal?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{we'd be happy to.}
<A>__{porthos produces a bottle from under his cloak.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{if you'll drink one with us to the king.}
<C>__{second cavalier}
<D>__{but the only king we recognize... is the cardinal.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{there are those who would call that treason.}
<C>__{first cavalier}
<D>__{happily, no such objections have been raised... here.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{all right. i will object.}
<C>__{second cavalier}
<D>__{i'm listening.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{let's see. you are, by your dress and by your manner, members of a bone lazy class of servile ninnyhammers whose slavish allegiance to his eminence the cardinal is as that of a dog who likes nothing better than to sniff today where he has peed the day before.}
<C>__{porthos }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{piss is piss, no matter what robes surround it.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{well said. i'm impressed. ninnyhammers.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i was momentarily inspired.}
<A>__{the cavaliers are not amused. the first replies in measured tones, his lips white with fury.}
<C>__{first cavalier}
<D>__{may i reply?}
<C>__{aramis}
<P>__{(courtly)}
<D>__{by all means.}
<C>__{first cavalier}
<D>__{better to be a dog in the service of a great master, than a beef witted moron so dazzled by the throne that he does not see the true nature of the foolish boy who wobbles atop it. which is to say, that most muddy brained of all men... a musketeer.}
<A>__{the cavaliers have already pulled out their swords. porthos and aramis now reach for their own. porthos deadpans:}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{maybe there's something about us that just pisses people off. at least i'd like to think so. it's too bad we can only kill them once.}
<B>__{fight}
<A>__{the middle of a river on a rocking flatboat is not the best place for a duel. but the combatants make the most of it. slipping, sliding, and falling. they attack with everything they've got. the cavaliers are excellent swordsmen. and, as if that were not enough, the musketeers have an additional disadvantage they must keep the woman and child clear of the flashing blades. porthos drives his opponent about the flatboat with a devilish grin, chases him between and at one point, over blindfolded horses. aramis duels with the expected artistry, gradually reducing his opponent to tatters. at one juncture, the child loses her footing, slides toward the low end of the flatboat, the deep river beyond. aramis executes a neat sidestep, stops the child's desperate progress with one arm while continuing to do battle with the other. he returns child to mother with a grin, continues. the two cavaliers are soon vanquished, groaning on the flatboat deck. porthos and aramis meet at the middle, breathless. porthos complains:}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i've been called a lot of things in my time...}
<C>__{aramis}
<P>__{(eyes on the opposite shore)}
<D>__{porthos...}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{but beef witted is a little more than i can stand, not to mention unfair...}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{porthos...}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{aramis indicates the opposite shore as the flatboat approaches it. there, waiting patiently, swords and muskets already drawn... is a patrol of cardinal's guards.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{can you swim?}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(doesn't like the sound of this)}
<D>__{no. my horse can.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{that'll do.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{but...?}
<A>__{aramis hurries to his horse, takes off the blindfold. porthos grumbles after, follows suit. they leap atop their mounts, the horses slip upon the wet deck as they guide them to the edge.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{you go first and i will watch your progress.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{no, no. please. after you.}
<A>__{stalemate. then, they can't help it, aramis and porthos grin. life is an adventure, lived to the fullest. they count...}
<C>__{aramis and porthos}
<D>__{one, two three!}
<A>__{and with that, as the woman and child, the ferryman look on, aramis and porthos guide their horses into the raging river. the woman whispers after:}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{thank you. god speed.}
<A>__{porthos manages a wink as he floats into the distance.}
<B>__{on shore}
<A>__{the cardinal's guards react with anger and disbelief.}
<B>__{river}
<A>__{a wild ride down the roaring river. porthos clinging to his horse for dear life. aramis keeping an eye on his fellow musketeer... and the deep rapids up ahead. through twists and turns, walls of white water, huge boulders, and gyrating whirlpools... aramis and porthos finally reach a quiet pool, a leafy shore beyond. they lead their horses from the water, step toward dry land... and see yet another (or perhaps the same) patrol of cardinal's guards. waiting, swords drawn, for their arrival. porthos looks down at his latest sash destroyed like the others. aramis draws his saber, mutters.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{a nice relaxing boat ride...}
<A>__{and with that, aramis and porthos charge towards the guards.}
