<D>__{hey, look at this...}
<A>__{enid points at the mini mall in front of them. a new restaurant we see their banner: "grand opening. wowsville the authentic 50's diner".}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{"authentic 50's diner"? since when were there mini malls in the 1950's?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{god, it's so totally pathetic.}

<A>__{they're in a booth looking at menus. it's a less accurate version of "johnny rockets". a golden oldie from the 80's plays on the jukebox.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{who can forget this great hit from the 50's?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i feel as though i've stepped into a time warp!}
<A>__{the waiter approaches. he has an ostentatious 70's style perm.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{check out the awesome "fifties" hairdo on the waiter.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{hi, my name is allen, and i will be your waiter this afternoon.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{hi, al!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{can we call you "weird al"?}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{heh heh. our specials today are pasta vasilio, which is a pasta salad with a light basil vinaigrette }
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{that was a popular dish in the 50's, huh weird al?}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{i imagine so! also, we have a spinach tortellini in a ricotta sauce. both of those are $6.95... shall i give you a few minutes to mull it over?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i just want an order of onion rings.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i might actually get the pasta special.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{you loser!}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{pasta special and an order of onion rings. very good.}
<A>__{al leaves.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{did you notice all those weird things on the menu? like "the salad explosion"?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i know... and instead of "dessert" it says "mindbenders."}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what does that even mean?}
