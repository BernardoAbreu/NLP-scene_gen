<T>__{fade to black:}
<A>__{in blackness, a title card appears:}
<D>__{"the mouse on the mile"}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior e block day}
<A>__{a low, static shot. green floor stretching before us. harry and bill dodge are at the desk b.g., doing paperwork and filing chores. percy is idling nearby, whistling softly and combing his hair... ...and into this quiet shot, deep in foreground, creeps the mouse. he starts walking the mile as before... ...right toward percy.}
<B>__{coffey}
<A>__{stares through his bars as the mouse goes by...}
<B>__{percy}
<A>__{keeps combing his hair, unaware...}
<B>__{del}
<A>__{sits quietly picking his nose in his cell. the mouse appears outside the bars, cruising inexorably up the mile. del turns slowly, watches the mouse go by...}
<B>__{percy}
<A>__{still grooming himself, still unaware...}
<B>__{the mouse}
<A>__{keeps coming closer. angle up to bitterbuck peering through his bars, watching him go by...}
<B>__{percy}
<A>__{keeps working that comb and freezes at the sound of a tiny squeak. his head swivels slowly... ...and there's the mouse. staring at him. that moment of eye contact reveals an enmity older than time itself. if mice have a natural enemy, percy is it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you little son of a bitch.}
<A>__{harry and bill glance up from their work.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, i will be damned. there he is, big as billy be frigged. i thought brutal was pulling my leg.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's a goddamn mouse.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah. brute said he was in here last night begging for food, came right up to the desk.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{my ass. give him some room, percy, see what he does.}
<A>__{percy takes a few careful steps back, eyes never leaving the mouse. (percy's hand starts easing toward the handle of his baton.) the mouse comes up to the desk as before.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{brave little bastard, gotta give him that.}
<A>__{harry breaks off a small piece of cracker and drops it. the mouse picks it up, starts to eat. (percy's hand inches ever closer to his baton).}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{here, lemme try.}
<A>__{bill drops a piece of cracker. the mouse ignores it completely, keeping its beady little eyes on harry. (percy's hand starts easing his baton from its holster.)}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{maybe he's full.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{maybe he knows you're just a floater. gotta be an e block regular to feed the e block mouse, don'cha know...}
<A>__{harry drops another piece and sure enough, the mouse starts to eat. harry's smile fades. he and bill trade a look.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i was just kidding ab }
<A>__{percy lets rip a bellowing war cry ("yaaaahhh!") and launches his baton like a spear, scaring the crap out of everyone. the mouse ducks (yes, actually ducks) and the baton sail over his head close enough to ruffle its fur, bouncing off the floor. apparently remembering a pressing engagement elsewhere, the mouse takes off in a flash toward the restraint room. percy roars with frustration and takes off after it, trying to squash it with his heavy work shoes, leaping and stomping with great big galloping strides, missing the mouse by inches... ...and thus is the green mile traversed, with percy stomping and hollering like a spastic flamenco dancer, the convicts yelling at their bars, the mouse zigging and zagging like jim thorpe heading for the endzone... the mouse wins, zipping to safety under the restraint room door. percy pounds his fist against the door in frustration:}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{he fumbles with his keys, unlocks the door, yelling all the while:}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{i'm gonna rip your diseased head off, you little piece of shit!}
<B>__{outside e block}
<A>__{paul and brutal are arriving for work they pause, hearing percy's yells drifting from the windows. the regular cons in the yard are drifting curiously to the fence, wondering if a riot's brewing. paul and brutal take off running }
<B>__{inside e block}
<A>__{ and rush in to find:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{percy met your mouse.}
<A>__{harry points. percy's down at the far end, rummaging wildly in the restraint room, tossing shit out onto the mile.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{it's in here somewhere! i'm gonna squish the little son of a bitch!}
<A>__{he starts muscling the filing cabinet out the door, kicking buckets out of his way. brutal calls out to him:}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{percy, we already tried that }
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{what? whad'ja say?}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{i said }
<A>__{paul stops brutal with a look don't you dare stop him.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{ uh, knock yourself out. hope you nail the bastard.}
<A>__{paul crosses his arms and smiles, leans back against the desk to wait...}
