<C>__{gil}
<D>__{i wouldn't get into too many details with them. let's just leave it that we're temporarily passing through.}
<C>__{adriana}
<P>__{(to gil)}
<D>__{can i speak with you a minute?}
<P>__{(to table)}
<D>__{permettez moi de m'absenter un instant.}
<P>__{(she gets him off)}
<D>__{let's never go back to the twenties.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{i think we should stay here it's the start of the belle epoque this is the greatest, most beautiful era paris has ever known.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{but i love the jazz age.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{the twenties are full of strife and uncertainty. but think of it, gil the two of us in a lovely art nouveau home i will work in the fashion world i love the styles you can write it's the age of debussy and guimard. maybe you can meet balzac.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{but what happened to the twenties and the charleston and cole porter?}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{that's the present, it's dull.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{it's not the present for me i'm from 2010.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{i dropped in on you just the way we dropped in on the 1890's.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{i wanted to escape my present just like you wanted to escape yours. to a golden age.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{surely you don't think the twenties are a golden age?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{to me they are.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{but i'm from the twenties and i'm tellin you the golden age is the belle epoque.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{yes but don't you see to these guys the golden age was the renaissance. they'd all trade the belle epoque to paint alongside michelangelo or titian. and those guys probably imagine life was better when kubla khan was around. i'm having an insight. a minor one but that accounts for the anxiety of my dream.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{what dream?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{last night i dreamed i ran out of zithromax and then i went to the dentist and there was no novacaine these people have no antibiotics }
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{and even in the twenties no dishwashers no 911 if your appendix bursts no "movies on demand"}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{but if we love each other what does it matter when we live?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{because if you stay here and this becomes your present, sooner or later you'll imagine another time was really the golden time. and so will i i'm beginning to see why it can't work, adriana. the present has a hold on you because it's your present and while there's never any progress in the most important things, you get to appreciate what little progress is made the internet pepto bismol. the present is always going to seem unsatisfying because life itself is unsatisfying that's why gauguin goes back and forth between paris and tahiti, searching it's my job as a writer to try and come up with reasons why despite life being tragic and unsatisfying, it's still worth it.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{that's the problem with writers you're all so full of words but i'm more emotional. i'm going to stay and live in paris' most glorious time. you made a choice to leave paris once and you regretted it.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{yes, that one i regretted but it was a real choice and i made the wrong one. this is a choice between accepting reality or surreal insanity.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{so finally you do love inez more than me.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{no i love you but this way lies madness and if i'm ever going to write anything worthwhile i've got to get rid of my illusions and that i'd be happier in the past is one of them.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{goodbye, gil.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{goodbye adriana. good luck.}
<A>__{they kiss, she turns and goes to the table of artists.}
