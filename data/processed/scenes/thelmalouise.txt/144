<D>__{isn't that nice? truck drivers are always so nice. the best drivers on the road.}
<A>__{as they get next to the truck, the truck driver is smiling and waving at them. they smile and wave back. he flicks his tongue at them. louise screams.}
<D>__{thelma louise ugh!! gross!! oh my god! aw, god!}
<A>__{louise floors it and speeds past him.}
<C>__{thelma}
