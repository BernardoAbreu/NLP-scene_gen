<L>__{interior a bed day}
<A>__{amy's eyes abruptly pop open. she's lying on a white pillow, with white sheets tucked up over her. she turns her eyes to one side. there's a hospital curtain, the kind on a railing, pulled closed around her. she looks down. she's lying in a hospital bed. she tries to move, but she realizes her hands and legs are tied to the bed by large leather straps. charles is there, in a chair, watching her.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{he takes a sip of coffee. she struggles with the straps.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{amy don't fight it, it's only going to make things worse.}
<A>__{her eyes dart around the room in a panic.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what the hell happened?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i didn't hear from you. i went over to your hotel. you were lying on the floor... covered in every kind of stuff that can come out of a human body...}
<A>__{she remembers.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{the blood...}
<A>__{amy looks down at her gown, expecting a large red stain, but there's no blood.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{okay. every other kind.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i don't... i mean i didn't...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{you were sort of... having a psychotic episode, sweets. major mental blow out. and frankly, it's about time. jesus you were tied down for a day and half.}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{listen, i'm trying to get you out of here, back to london, but with the damage to your hotel room... they're not going to be so quick to let you go.}
<A>__{amy takes a look around the psych ward. patients walking aimlessly, mumbling to themselves, arguing with unseen opponents, rocking back and forth in catatonic states.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{look, amy, you probably won't have to stay...}
<A>__{amy feels a sudden rush of relief. a little nervous laughter.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{hey, charles, charles... this is the best news i've had in a long time.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{well, there you go. a whole new definition of optimism.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what about marla chen? the story?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{they found her dead in her room. she hung herself.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{they found her. you mean the police?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{yeah. she'd been there awhile. probably did it right after she sent us the tape.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{jesus, i don't know. does it matter?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{no, i guess not.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{but this is a good story too. call it, "my psychotic episode" or, wait, maybe "psychotic episode one." or "psychotic pilot episode." you know, some play on words with episode.}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{look, there's a lot of raw material around here. emphasis on the word "raw." maybe they'll let you use a felt tip pen or something to take notes.}
<A>__{somebody pulls the curtain aside. it's an orderly. his name tag identifies him as m. kircher. this guy's a little out there, like maybe he's been dipping into the medicine cabinet a little too much. his eyes nervously scan the room, like somebody's watching him.}
<C>__{kircher}
<D>__{well look who's back. how we feelin?}
<A>__{she motions to the straps.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{trapped.}
<C>__{kircher}
<D>__{sorry. they're for your own protection. the way you were flailing around when they brought you in somebody was bound to get hurt.}
<P>__{(he chuckles to himself)}
<D>__{get it. bound to get hurt.}
<A>__{amy doesn't laugh. doesn't even crack a smile.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{don't quit your day job.}
<C>__{charles}
<P>__{(to kircher)}
<D>__{what's say we lose the charm bracelets for now?}
<P>__{(turns to amy)}
<D>__{unless of course you somehow find all of this stimulating.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{don't drag me into your fantasies charles.}
<P>__{(to kircher)}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{kircher obliges and scribbles something on a folder at the end of the bed. charles leans over, gives her a little peck on the cheek. as he does, he whispers to her.}
<C>__{charles}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i will see about getting a camera in here...}
<A>__{he stands, winks at her.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{feel better.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when you get a chance, check out the public area. it's a swinging place. i mean, like, they're literally... swinging.}
<A>__{he heads out. amy watches him go. she waits a beat, and then hops out of bed. she looks around for nurses and orderlies but there's no one around. she exits frame.}
