<T>__{fade slowly to black:}
<L>__{interior hospital night}
<A>__{voices fade in slowly, inaudible at first. for regular viewers of the show, they will recognize the voices of the lone gunmen. three nerdish paranoiacs who publish a magazine which charts and cataloged conspiracies past and present, among other government malfeasance. they are langly, byers and frohike.}
<C>__{byers}
<D>__{i think he's coming out }
<C>__{langly}
<D>__{he's coming to.}
<C>__{frohike}
<D>__{hey, mulder...}
<T>__{fade up:}
<A>__{, as if our eyes are blinking open. we are in mulder's pov, and the face right above us is frohike's.}
<C>__{frohike}
<D>__{mulder...?}
<A>__{behind frohike, looking down at mulder, are byers and langly.}
<B>__{reverse on mulder}
<A>__{staring at the diminutive frohike, the long haired langly and the courtly byers with dawning recognition.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{oh god...}
<C>__{langly}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{mulder}
<P>__{(to byers, then langly)}
<D>__{tin man. scarecrow.}
<P>__{(to frohike)}
<D>__{toto.}
<A>__{mulder sits up now, rubbing his face, feeling the bandage he's got on his head.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{what am i doing here?}
<C>__{byers}
<D>__{you were shot in the head. the bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.}
<C>__{mulder}
<P>__{(woozy)}
<D>__{penetration but not perforation.}
<C>__{langly}
<D>__{three centimetres to the left and we'd be playing the harp.}
<A>__{mulder is still shaking out the cobwebs.}
<C>__{byers}
<D>__{they gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. but you've been unconscious since they brought you in.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{when was that?}
<C>__{frohike}
<D>__{two days ago. your guy skinner's been here with you around the clock.}
<C>__{langly}
<D>__{we got the news and made a trip to your apartment. found a bug in your phone line.}
<C>__{frohike}
<D>__{and one in your hall.}
<A>__{byers holds up the first small device. frohike holds up a vial containing a bee. mulder realizing:}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting }
<C>__{byers}
<D>__{you called 911. except the call was intercepted.}
<C>__{mulder}
<P>__{(sitting up)}
<D>__{they took her }
<A>__{mulder pushes the covers off. swinging his legs to the ground. as a.d. skinner enters the room. surprised to see mulder up.}
<C>__{skinner}
<D>__{agent mulder }
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{where's scully?!}
<A>__{as he says this he loses his balance slightly, has to hold onto one of the gunmen. struggling with his faculties.}
<C>__{skinner}
<D>__{she's missing. we've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{whoever they are this goes right back to dallas it goes right back to the bombing }
<C>__{skinner}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(off mulder's reaction to this)}
<D>__{agent scully reported your suspicions to opr. on the basis of her report, i sent techs over to s.a.c. michaud's apartment. they picked up pstn residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in dallas.}
<C>__{mulder}
<P>__{(reeling)}
<D>__{how deep does this go?}
<C>__{skinner}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{mulder sees a man in a suit passes by the small window in the door, casting a furtive glance in, then moving off. he turns his look back to skinner.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{are we being watched?}
<C>__{skinner}
<D>__{i'm not taking any chances.}
<A>__{mulder nods. pulling now at the bandage on his head. peeling it away and revealing the wound beneath.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{i need your clothes, byers.}
<C>__{byers}
<D>__{me?}
<C>__{skinner}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{i've got to find scully.}
<C>__{frohike}
<D>__{do you know where she is?}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{no. but i know someone who might have an answer. who better.}
<A>__{mulder is undoing his hospital gown now, his white buns gracing the screen for the first time in history. as he ducks into the bathroom. as the men left standing in the room all look to byers, reluctantly removing his duds. off this:}
