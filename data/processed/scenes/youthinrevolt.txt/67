<A>__{sheeni relaxes on a love seat, cradling the phone with her shoulder as she eats grapes from a bowl. we intercut.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{of course, he was disconsolate, but we talked all day and he's come to see this as an opportunity for growth. oh, and nick, trent wanted me to tell you that he bears you no ill will.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{nor i him. i wish him all the best.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{his parents are sending him to a french speaking boarding school this year. he's sure to get along there. so how is my darling albert?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{well, though he's taken a disliking to jerry.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{and you, nickie? how are you?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i regret, love of my life, my father has lost his job and i will now be forced to go to public school.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{how unfortunate. what did he do?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{he's a writer sort of. he writes advertising copy.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{really?}
<P>__{(pensive beat)}
<D>__{nick, i suggest we look at your father's firing as a blessing in disguise.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{i propose we get your father a job here in ukiah and you can come and live with him.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{brilliant. not that i'm fond of ukiah, but i'd live in a drainage culvert to be with you.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{oh, nickie. now, i happen to know progressive plywood is looking for an assistant editor. it would be perfect for your father.}
<A>__{nick furrows his brow with skepticism.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i had no idea you had knowledge of the employment opportunities of trade magazines.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{the owner is the father of a friend of mine.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{anyone i know?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{okay, it's trent's father. so what?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so why would trent want to help my father move to ukiah?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{i told you, darling. trent harbors you no ill will. i will have him call your father up pretending to be a head hunter.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{very well, but i don't see how i am to live with him. my mother values my indentured servitude.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{you must influence her to send you away. i feel this will require being in a constant state of open revolt on your part.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{i propose you rent the film rebel without a cause as soon as possible. you must emulate james dean...}
<A>__{close on her glossy lips.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{...you must be bad, nickie. be very, very bad.}
<A>__{a glint of resolve in nick's eyes.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i will, darling. i will!}
<A>__{and in pre lap comes the ding dong of the doorbell.}
