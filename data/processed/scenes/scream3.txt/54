<L>__{interior jennifer jollie's house night}
<A>__{gale and tom enter. jennifer is crying hysterically in dewey's arms. she sees gale, looks up with anger written all over her gaudy, over rouged face, her make up running in a comical, almost homage to mimi on the drew carey show.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you! how can i ever get any fame playing you!}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? what's wrong jen, see yourself on one of those usa network winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{god damn you gale weathers! don't you see? the killer is choosing his victims as they die in the script! ben damon's character was the first one to get offed. so was his girlfriend but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed then sarah darling's candy, and now me!}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{wait a second, whoa! calm down! number one there were five different versions of the script given out. ben damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. it only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. and what, i die in stab 3?}
<A>__{everyone is silent. dewey nods his head. gale rips the script from jennifer's hands.}
<C>__{gale}
<P>__{(reading script)}
<D>__{and i die naked?! ugh! this is complete bullshit. who wrote this piece of crap?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i know right. it was kinda weak. that's cause will kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. the script was written by some new guy. he wrote arlington street.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{still that was a much better movie, i saw it at the premiere last week. god, what the hell am i getting sidetracked with this shit for?! we've gotta get down to business.}
<A>__{a teary eyed angelina tyler rises up from the couch, approaches the group.}
<C>__{angelina}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{what are you talking about? because of this shit i will probably never act in a hollywood film again.}
<A>__{tom throws his arm around angelina, squeezes her tightly.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hey good looking, if you play your cards right, i may be able to sit you down on my casting couch and try you out for a few films my production company is working on.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{how do you feel about a deep throat remake?}
<A>__{angelina squeals in disgust, elbows tom, racing out of the house. tom groans, follows after her.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i will be right back.}
