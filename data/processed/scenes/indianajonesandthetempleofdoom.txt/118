<A>__{the moaning wind rushes past indiana, willie and short round as they watch the mystery cult below bowing toward an enormous altar at the far end of the temple. this altar is a platform jutting out from the stone wall of the cavern. separating the worshippers from this altar is a wide crevasse out of which wisps of smoke rise occasionally.}

<A>__{on the other side of the crevasse, evil looking priests materialize out of clouds of swirling smoke. the priests carry smoke billowing urns to a giant stone statue. now, we see the hideous protectress of the temple, the obscenely malevolent ombect of the cult's devotion: the bloodthirsty god dess kali! the red eyed priests bow at the base of the statue and gaze reverently at their kali ma. skulls surround her stone feet carved serpents twist up her legs, while around her waist there is a guresome belt of human hands. naked to the hips, kali's hair falls about her four arms. in her hand, she holds a sword, in the second the severed head of a giant.with her other hands she encourages her worshipers, who are chanting louder and louder! kali's face is loathsome: her earrings are two corpses. her evil tongue extends out of her twisted mouth and what looks like read blood flows over her long fangs and down her naked breasts.}
