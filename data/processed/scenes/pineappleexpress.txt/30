<C>__{red}
<D>__{no one. nada.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{awesome! look at that! everything's fine. we had a crazy night in the woods, which i assume we can both put behind us like grown ups, and now we can use red's giant bong to get super duper high.}
<A>__{dale doesn't seem convinced. saul picks up red's huge bong and starts to pack a bit of red's weed into it.}
<C>__{red}

<A>__{saul sits down and picks up a lighter as red walks towards the phone. dale watches red, suspicious of his odd behavior. red begins to dial... smack! dale knocks the phone out of red's hand.}

<D>__{what the fuck!}
<A>__{saul jumps up. dale snatches the phone and backs up.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i'm sorry! i'm sorry!}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{dale! what the fuck are you doing?}
