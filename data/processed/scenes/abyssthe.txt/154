<A>__{behind her, something rises from the depths. it is the little vehicle she almost collided with at the montana wreck. it comes right up behind her. she doesn't know it's there. it hovers sideways like a hummingbird, as if curious, trying to get a better look. she becomes aware of the pulsing glow on the ground around her. she turns slowly. we see her react as the glowing, pulsing apparition is reflected in her faceplate. a more powerful glow washes up onto her from below. her eyes go down. she gasps, absolutely stunned... above the edge of the wall, an enormous shape rises silently out of the depths. over sixty feet across. it looks like a blown glass manta ray, its transparent outer hull housing interior structures of great delicacy and complexity, pulsing with a blue violet glow. lindsey stand before it, unable to move. absolutely rapt. captivated by its ethereal beauty. it begins to turn, majestically, one rounded wing passing only a few feet above her. she reaches up. touches it as it passes over her. lindsey is without fear, completely mesmerized. the thing completes its turn and dives gracefully down along the wall. she is gently lifted by a backwash of turbulent water. about that time, lindsey remembers she has a still camera, a little nikonos. she fumbles to set focus and exposure with her bulky gloves as the beautiful machine glides into the depths. gets all set for a shot and... woosh! the little 'scoutschip' whizzes past her from behind, startling her. she completely misses the shot of the 'manta ship'. she pivots, trying to get a shot of the little one as it zig zags down along the wall, fast as a meteor. click. she get a shot a second before it disappears. from around the flank of the rig module, catfish appears. their com sets come backs to life, along with their lights.}
