<A>__{in an already spanish colonel dining room, columbus is having dinner with his brothers, bartolome and giacomo, served by an indian woman nima. giacomo eats with gusto.}
<C>__{giacomo}
<P>__{(as nima pours the wine)}
<D>__{nima's a good cook!}
<C>__{bartolome}
<D>__{she's more than that!}
<A>__{seeing giacomo's sudden blush and discomfort, as nima smiles at him, the other brothers laugh. to cover his embarrassment, giacomo returns to the topic of the food.}
<C>__{giacomo}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{eat! i will tell you later.}
<A>__{as he sees bartolome stifling a laugh, giacomo pauses.}
<C>__{giacomo}
<D>__{i'd like to know what i'm eating.}
<A>__{columbus eats a mouthful, glances at bartolome.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{iguana.}
<A>__{a look of horror crosses giacomo's face; he wretches slightly, puts down his fork, and gulps down some wine. the brothers laugh again.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{what wrong with it? the indians eat it!}
<C>__{giacomo}
<D>__{i'm not an indian.}
<C>__{bartolome}
<D>__{he wishes he were back in the seminary. priests always eat well.}
<P>__{(tasting his wine, grimacing)}
<D>__{and they have very good cellars.}
<C>__{giacomo}
<D>__{nothing grows here! everything rots in the ground. the wheat and vines wither before we can harvest them.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{we've got to learn to live like the indians.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{eat your iguana!}
<A>__{reluctantly this time, giacomo goes back to his dinner.}
