<A>__{they continue laughing and moving down bluestone road when they are jolted by the appearance of; beloved. waiting in her usual place for sethe. her hands wrapped in a long shawl, waiting to be given to sethe. her eyes only on sethe, not even acknowledging paul's presence. sethe gets herself down from paul.}
