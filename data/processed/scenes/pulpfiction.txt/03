<A>__{an old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 chevy nova barrels down a homeless ridden street in hollywood. in the front seat are two young fellas one white, one black both wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters. their names are vincent vega (white) and jules winnfield (black). jules is behind the wheel.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{okay now, tell me about the hash bars?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what so you want to know?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{well, hash is legal there, right?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. i mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. you're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{those are hash bars?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. it's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause get a load of this if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you. searching you is a right that the cops in amsterdam don't have.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{that did it, man i'm fuckin' goin', that's all there is to it.}

<D>__{examples?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{well, in amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. and i don't mean in a paper cup either. they give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. in paris, you can buy beer at macdonald's. also, you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in paris?}
