<L>__{interior cipriani hotel day}
<A>__{a standard hotel room no lavish suite this time. cara stands in front of the mirror. her shirt is unbuttoned as she works to attach a tiny microphone to her bra. the tape gets stuck to itself and she has to start over... a knock on her hotel room door.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{frank enters the room. sees her half dressed }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{it's okay. come over here. i need your help.}
<A>__{in an echo of their first meeting on the train (but without the false flirtation) she turns to him and hands him a piece of tape. their eyes meet. a flicker of a smile passes between them. frank's fingers are perfectly steady this time as he helps her secure the microphone and do up her shirt.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{ackerman told me everything.}
<A>__{she takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{i'm sorry frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{there's no apology necessary.}
<A>__{he steps back from her. she smooths her blouse. turns to him.}
<C>__{cara}
<P>__{(re: the wire)}
<D>__{how do i look?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{like the most beautiful woman on earth.}
<A>__{the complete honesty and directness of his compliment takes her by surprise. she's strangely moved by it. she brushes her hand affectionately over his cheek.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{when will you go home?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{ackerman asked me to stay with the surveillance team in case the thugs who came after me at the danieli show up. i'm the only one who can identify them.}
<A>__{something occurs to frank.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{did you tell him to keep an eye on me?}
<C>__{cara}
<P>__{(busted)}
<D>__{i told him to make sure you were safe until this was over.}
<A>__{he nods. a little pleased at her concern.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you shouldn't worry about me. what about you?}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{what about me?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what are you going to do?}
<A>__{she takes a beat, then puts her game face on.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{my job.}
