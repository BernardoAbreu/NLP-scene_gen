<D>__{come on everybody up the ladder.}
<A>__{he's the first one up. sean looks at rennie, concerned, then hoists toby up in his arms. they all begin climbing the ladder. close on ladder night as the last pair of feet disappear over the top edge of the dock. camera pans back down the rungs, finding the lifeboat and barge again. suddenly jason springs from the water, climbing onto the barge. he gazes up at his new surroundings, quite different from all the years he's spent at crystal lake. but an item at the far end of the dock causes him the longest pause... jason's point of view a tattered billboard over one of the warehouses advertises the new york rangers hockey team, featuring a full shot of the hockey masked goalie.}
