<L>__{interior king's bedchamber day}
<A>__{the king has just climaxed in his lovemaking, and lies spent upon michelle. his rest is interrupted by a knock at his door. the king scowls.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{your majesty... it is andre.}
<A>__{louis groans, and pulls on a robe. michelle whispers }
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{shall i leave?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{no, you may wait behind the screen.}
<A>__{michelle rises and slips behind a painted dressing screen as louis goes to the door and admits the young lieutenant. behind the screen, michelle lifts a jeweled hand mirror and appraises her face; she begins brushing her long hair. she can hear the conversation...}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{i would not have disturbed you, majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yes, yes, go on.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{athos, the former musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the musketeers' gate.}
<A>__{behind the screen, michelle pauses at the mention of athos.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{did they kill him?}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{no. he cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt. captain d'artagnan allowed him to leave. athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.}
<A>__{crash! from behind the screen comes the sound of the mirror, shattering as it drops to the floor. it startles the lieutenant, but the king goes on...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{who was athos seeking? tell me! did he try to enter the palace?}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{... he did but captain d'artagnan blocked his way.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you may go, lieutenant.}
<A>__{the lieutenant moves back to the door.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{do you want athos arrested, your majesty?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{not by you. i will order d'artagnan to do it.}
<A>__{the lieutenant leaves, and louis moves behind the screen to see michelle stagger and grip the dressing table; her bare feet step onto the broken glass of the mirror, yet she is oblivious to the cuts. louis sees this and grabs her.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{my dear! the glass !}
<A>__{he pulls her to the couch and draws a blanket about her, cuddling her as she begins to shake.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{did you know... about raoul?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i did not want to upset you. it was tragic. i did everything i could for him. i ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting. but he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.}
<A>__{he cuddles her as she weeps.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i will order a mass for his soul. it will guarantee his place in heaven.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{oh louis, louis...}
<A>__{she clings to him in her grief.}
