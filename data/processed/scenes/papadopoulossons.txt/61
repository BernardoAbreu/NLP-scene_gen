<C>__{rob}
<D>__{pap & sons is still a cash cow.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what's the potential deal structure?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{that's the pisser.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{you'd still be key to running the business, but...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{but?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{money isn't cheap harry. these guys will want at least 95% of the company.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{leaving me with nothing. i'd do the same thing. i'd be ceo of papadopoulos & sons. get a salary. get my house back. my children's future.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it beats fish and chips.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{you'd be working for someone else.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'd be working for someone else. by the way, i'm not actually running a fish and chip shop. just helping my brother relaunch.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{sure. listen, there maybe another way. came up in conversation with the norske velconan bank. it'd be along the lines of a straight loan to buy back the business.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{why would they lend me the money?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{well. let's ask them. want me to look into it?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sure, no choice.}
<A>__{rob's mobile alarm goes off.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{okay. cool. got to go. got an emergency with get this a high tech portable toilet company that has literally gone down the tubes.}
<P>__{(rob holds up a flyer for the company)}
<D>__{an internet ready, wireless, crapper with a waterproof keyboard and screen. for the love of god. because taking a dump needed an overhaul. still, somebody's got to bury them. inomine patre, spiritu, sanctu... etc, etc.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{got to love a downturn.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{laters.}
<A>__{rob exits. sophie starts to pack her files.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{i think what you're currently doing with your brother sounds liberating.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm liberating myself of my last 25 grand on a disused chip shop.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{but its like a startup. isn't that the most exciting phase of any venture? taking a bit of a risk. developing your products and your services. learning about your market. look, some of the largest companies on the planet never make a profit. like a real profit. it's all accounting tricks and leveraged debt. what i'm trying to say is, does it matter if the business is a small one? as long as it makes a profit and the people who work there are happy?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what are you doing working in a place like this?}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{this is only temporary. i got divorced recently. came to london for a fresh start. i'm actually looking into setting up my own business.}
<C>__{harry}

<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{i've been meaning to ask. can i come and visit your shop sometime?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{there isn't one.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{when it's up and running.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's a chip shop. it's hot. on your feet all hours. verbal abuse from customers on a friday night.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{i wasn't applying for a job harry. just wanted to stop by.}
<A>__{sophie exits.}
