<L>__{exterior boat deck port side night}
<A>__{on the port side lightoller is getting people into boat 2. he keeps his pistol in his hand at this pointerior twenty feet below them the sea is pouring into the doors and windows of b deck staterooms. they can hear the roar of water cascading into the ship.}
<C>__{lightoller}
<A>__{women and children, please. women and children only. step back, sir. even with jack's arms wrapped around her, rose is shivering in the cold. near her a woman with two young daughters looks into the eyes of a husband she knows she may not see again}
<C>__{husband}
<A>__{goodbye for a little while... only for a little while.}
<P>__{(to his two little girls)}
<A>__{go with mummy. the woman stumbles to the boat with the children, hiding her tears from them. beneath the false good cheer, the man is choked with emotion.}
<C>__{husband}
<A>__{hold mummy's hand and be a good girl. that's right. some of the women are stoic, others are overwhelmed by emotion and have to be helped into the boats. a man scribbles a note and hands it to a woman who is about to board.}
<C>__{man}
<A>__{please get this to my wife in demoines, iowa. jack looks at tommy and fabrizio.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{you better check out the other side. they nod and run off, searching for a way around the deckhouse.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{i'm not going without you.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{get in the boat, rose. cal walks up just then.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{yes. get in the boat, rose. she is shocked to see him. she steps instinctively to jack. cal looks at her, standing there shivering in her wet slip and stockings, a shocking display in 1912.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{my god, look at you.}
<P>__{(taking off his boat)}
<A>__{here, put this on. she numbly shrugs into it. he is doing it for modesty, not the cold.}
<C>__{lightoller}
<A>__{quickly, ladies. step into the boat. hurry, please!}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{go on. i will get the next one.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{no. not without you! she doesn't even care that cal is standing right there. he sees the emotion between jack and rose and his jaw clenches. but then he leans close to her and says...}
<C>__{cal}
<P>__{(low)}
<A>__{there are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. jack and i can get off safely. both of us.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(he smiles reassuringly)}
<A>__{i will be alright. hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{get in... hurry up, it's almost full. lightoller grabs her arm and pulls her toward the boat. she reaches out for jack and her fingers brush his for a moment. then she finds herself stepping down into the boat. it's all a rush and blur.}
<C>__{lightoller}
<A>__{lower away! the two men watch at the rail as the boat begins to descend.}
<C>__{cal}
<P>__{(low)}
<A>__{you're a good liar.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{almost as good as you.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{i always win, jack. one way or another.}
<P>__{(looks at him, smiling)}
<A>__{pity i didn't keep that drawing. it's going to be worth a lot more by morning. jack knows he is screwed. he looks down at rose, not wanting to waste a second of his last view of her.}
