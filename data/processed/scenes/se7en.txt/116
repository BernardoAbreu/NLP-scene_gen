<L>__{interior bookstore night}
<A>__{the bookstore is a labyrinth. tables and shelves, mountains and valleys of books. books, new and used, hard and soft, in disorganized groups. classical music plays. a few customers search for titles. somerset walks, downcast, winds out of one aisle into another. he has his jacket over his shoulder, runs his fingers along the books as he goes. he pulls one book, the merchant of venice, looks at it, replaces it. he looks down the aisle and is surprised to see tracy. tracy stands solemn, scanning book spines. somerset approaches.}
