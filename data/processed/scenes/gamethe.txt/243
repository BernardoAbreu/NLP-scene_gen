<A>__{the hallelujah chorus from handel's "messiah" plays. schuyler and david enter together from the atrium, the cushion deflates behind them. david licks blood from his lips, rubs his jaw.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you've been wanting to do that for a long, long time, haven't you?}
<A>__{schuyler half smiles. the security man unlocks schuyler's handcuffs, giving him back his gun, which schuyler stares at.}

<D>__{like they'd really leave a loaded gun lying around. they went over the whole place with a metal detector, then packed that thing with blanks.}
<A>__{they turn a corner into the main lobby, schuyler absently pockets the gun, looks up in wonder... schuyler's pov a surprise party: a stereo, streamers and balloons, a champagne fountain, cake and food. crs employees (mostly ordinary looking office workers) clap and cheer for schuyler. they wear party hats, blow plastic horns. smiling people eager to offer congratulations surround him. he's pretty shaky, like a newborn calf. john and pete shake his hand.}

<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{awesome game best i've seen.}
<A>__{not knowing what else to do, schuyler takes a slug. the girl from the boat kisses his cheek. technicians, men with stunts unlimited t shirts, the nurse from the asylum, the security people, crs guards, agents, all want a piece of him at once. the "messiah" fades and an r & b band breaks into rousing music as feingold approaches and sticks a cigar in his mouth, lights it.}
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{sure glad you jumped, compadre. otherwise i was supposed to throw you off.}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{it's not strictly legal, so don't tell anyone...}
<P>__{(a beat, off schuyler's look)}
<D>__{the cigar. it's a monte cristo, straight from havana.}

<C>__{christine}
<D>__{god?}
<A>__{she winks and strolls off. schuyler smiles, looking after her. dancing is starting up in bg. a clutch of non crs people approach tentatively including plympton, elizabeth, maria and jack. they all look very confused.}

<D>__{what is this, sky? we got a call from your brother, said there was a surprise party...}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{kind of late for your birthday, isn't it?}
<A>__{schuyler laughs, gives her a hug, surprising her. he still has a giddy smile plastered on his face.}
