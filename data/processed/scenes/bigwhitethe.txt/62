<L>__{exterior bottom of ridge day}
<A>__{the corpse is covered with a tarp. the area is littered with blood, animal tracks and bits of blue parka. police officers and tough looking local snowmobilers mill about the corpse, taking turns lifting the tarp that covers the body. a few yards away, detective boyle (60s) talks to a seemingly distraught paul.}
<C>__{detective boyle}
<P>__{(looking at the ridge)}
<D>__{if it's any comfort to you, he likely wasn't eaten while conscious. did he say where he'd been living, before he came home?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{florida. he didn't really talk about it much. he brought us this shell.}
<A>__{paul holds up a sea shell, obviously from the display at his office. tears well up in his eyes.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{it's really all we have left. he'd been gone for five years. we'd given him up }
<C>__{detective boyle}
<D>__{ for dead, yes sir.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{how did you...?}
<C>__{detective boyle}
<D>__{anonymous phone tip from some jamaican guy.}
<P>__{(paul shows no reaction)}
<D>__{said he saw what looked like a body. we tracked you through his id.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{just like on tv.}
<A>__{boyle nods sympathetically}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{i've got to see him. please.}
<A>__{paul starts to make his way to the body. boyle stops him.}
<C>__{detective boyle}
<D>__{mr. barnell, i should warn you, an animal attack isn't pretty. there's not much left.}
<A>__{paul nods. they make their way over to the tarp. boyle pulls it back.}
<C>__{detective boyle }
<D>__{is that your brother, sir?}
<A>__{paul leans in the man's face is hamburger. paul nods.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{they chewed his ears off. what kind of animal does something like that?}
<C>__{detective boyle}
<D>__{normally i'd say bear, but these tracks and the feeding pattern indicate wolf. it's rare, but it can happen.}
<A>__{boyle pulls the cover back over the body. boyle hands barnell a clear baggie with the dead man's wallet inside.}
<C>__{detective boyle }
<D>__{your brother's personal effects. we've got some people with the victim's assistance program who can help you through this. marcie?}
<A>__{marcie, a female police officer, walks a distraught paul away. as they go, another female cop approaches.}
<C>__{female cop}
<D>__{coroner found some smaller bite marks on the ankle.}
<C>__{detective boyle}
<D>__{pups. must have been the whole freakin' pack.}
<C>__{female cop}
<D>__{you want an autopsy?}
<C>__{detective boyle}
<D>__{on what?}
<C>__{female cop}
<D>__{derek found this.}
<A>__{she holds up a clear evidence bag with the remnants of a strip of bacon on the inside.}
<C>__{detective boyle}
<D>__{not the smartest snack for a hiker.}
<C>__{female cop}
<D>__{messy animals aren't they?}
<C>__{detective boyle}
<D>__{messy. messy messy messy messy.}
