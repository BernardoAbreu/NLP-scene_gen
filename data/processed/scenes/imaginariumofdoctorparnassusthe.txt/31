<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{...at what price....}
<A>__{dr. parnassus looks haggard. he closes his eyes. he sways and drops the paper weight.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{father!...}
<A>__{at that moment the wagon lurches to a stop and we hear frantic banging on the roof. dr parnassus is glad of the excuse not to go on.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{we've stopped.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{what do you mean `at what price'?}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(turning back to his tarot cards)}
<D>__{it'll wait, it'll wait. another time. something's happened. you'd better go and see.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{typical! you insist i listen to a story and then you don't finish it!}
<A>__{more banging from above.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{go and see!}
<A>__{valentina turns and goes. parnassus looks miserable but, almost relieved. he turns over the next card. it's the hanged man. it depicts a body hanging from a gibbet surrounded by several arcane objects. parnassus studies the card, trying to wring some meaning from it then lays the hanged man in the space between the others. he takes a swig from the bottle.}
