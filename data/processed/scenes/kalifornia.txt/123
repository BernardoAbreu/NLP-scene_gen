<L>__{exterior parked lincoln later}
<A>__{a deserted plain. it's very quiet here. until the silence is broken by the sound of gunshots. reveal early teaching brian how to shoot. a row of tin cans are set up on a rusty old car. it's obvious that brian's enthralled with the idea of shooting the gun. even if he isn't hitting anything.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{only thing my old man ever gave me is that goddamn .45.}
<A>__{brian fires off another shot, misses again.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{bri', you're jerkin' it when you pull the trigger, hold it real steady.}
<A>__{nearby stands an unhappy carrie. adele pulls her yoyo out of her pocket.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{boys'll be boys.}
<A>__{carrie doesn't respond. adele offers the yoyo to carrie.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{you know any tricks?}
<A>__{carrie shakes her head no. adele withdraws her offer.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{you wanna learn some?}
<A>__{again carrie declines. her steely gaze returns to brian.}
<B>__{on early and brian}
<A>__{early helps brian to hold the gun.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{steady... breath in... now let half of it out, and... fire.}
<A>__{bang!! the can flies off the tree stump. brian turns to carrie to see her reaction... but she's already on her way back to the car, and she's furious. concerned, brian starts to follow after her... but early grabs his attention.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{bri, i want you to keep this gun... consider it a present. never know, california could turn out to be a dangerous place.}
<A>__{brian gazes at the gun resting in the palm of his hand.}
