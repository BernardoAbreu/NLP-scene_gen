<L>__{exterior village day}
<A>__{algren walks through the village, past the swordsmith who is now honing the blade, carefully sharpening it.}
<B>__{.exterior cherry tree forest day}
<A>__{algren makes his way through a stunning cherry forest near the village. the pink and red blossoms are dazzling and abundant. other villagers can be seen gathering cherry bl ossoms. it is a place of otherworldly beaut y. it is all so beautiful that algren just stops. takes it in for a moment. he reaches out and touches a blossom.}
<C>__{katsumoto }
<D>__{a perfect blossom is a rare thing...}
<A>__{algren turns. katsumoto is kneeling nearby, meditating.}
<C>__{ka tsumoto}
<D>__{you could spend your life looking for one. and it would not be a wasted life.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{were you praying?}
<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{just sitting... i do not think i have the word. satori it means, maybe, awareness.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{of what?}
<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{this moment alone, apart from all others ... you know this?}
<P>__{(algren shakes his head)}
<D>__{i am writing a poem about this time we hive spent. i have only written one line on "his eyes were like my own but seen through a deep and troubled ocean." can you suggest a second line?}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{i'm not much of a writer.}
<C>__{ka tsumoto}
<D>__{is this why you spend so much time with your journal? . algren how do you know that?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{she told you.}
<A>__{katsumoto appraises algren.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{did you love her husband as your own son?}
<C>__{ka tsumoto}
<D>__{you have sent men to their deaths, just as i have.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{the difference is, you feel nothing.}
<C>__{ka tsumoto}
<D>__{before you were a soldier, you were a farmer.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{what does that have to do with anything?}
<C>__{ka tsumoto}
<D>__{you lived on a farm. or in a forest of trees.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{ka tsumoto}
<D>__{the wa y you look at the cherry blossoms.}
<C>__{algren}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{we lived in a place called connecticut. my...brother and i climbed the maple trees.}
<C>__{ka tsumoto}
<D>__{were they beautiful?}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{and you were sad to see them die in the winter.}
<A>__{a beat. something flickers in algren's eyes.}
<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{you were something before you were a soldier. you were a boy who was sad to see the leaves fall and the trees die.}
<A>__{katsumoto looks at him deepl y.}
<C>__{ka tsumoto}
<D>__{like those trees, we are all dying. the future is an illusion, our plans are an illusion, our fears an illusion. we live life in every breath. eat, drink, fuck. now. every cup of tea. every word we write... every blossom we hold.}
<A>__{he smiles sadly.}
<C>__{ka tsumoto}
<D>__{every life we take.}
<A>__{a beat. he stands, takes in the beautiful cherry orchard.}
<C>__{katsumoto}
<D>__{life in every breath. that is bushido. the wa y of the samurai.}
<A>__{he goes. algren stands for a moment deep in thought}
