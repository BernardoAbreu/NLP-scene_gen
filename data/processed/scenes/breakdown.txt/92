<A>__{it's nearly pitch black. a beam of sunlight shines through a rusted hole. it illuminates jeff's eyes. the car shifts into gear and sets off across the desert. jeff grunts as the car bounces on the uneven terrain. he braces against the confines of the trunk. the engine noise is deafening. the car hits a depression and jounces wildly. jeff is thrown about violently.}
