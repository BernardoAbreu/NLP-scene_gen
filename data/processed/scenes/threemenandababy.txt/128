<A>__{peter has his arm around natalie's waist. she's a little drunk. he kisses her and leads her into his room, clos ing the door behind him. michael and jack, who were spying on them, tiptoe over to the door. they are silently exulting over peter's second victory.}
<L>__{interior lobby of office building day}
<A>__{michael enters a fancy building on 5th avenue. he's carrying a big portfolio and is full of beans. in the lobby, he pushes the button for the elevator and looks around absentmindedly. his gaze suddenly freezes on something. by the guard's desk he notices a stroller. inside, look ing pretty bored, is mary. michael is overwhelmed. he walks toward mary and through the sea of people they exchange an intense look. he looks around and suddenly sees sylvia and two men deep in discussion coming out of an elevator. michael, startled, runs and hides behind one of the elevators, staring out wide eyed. sylvia is dressed in a very chic, tight black suit, with a veiled little black hat and spiked heels. one of the men is carrying a bunch of cameras. they walk out toward the front door, and sylvia suddenly stops. she seems to have forgotten something. she kisses them goodbye and heads toward the elevator. once she's out of their sight, she turns and waits for them to leave. when they're gone for sure, she rushes toward mary and showers her with kisses.}

<D>__{here you are, my angel... are you okay, honey? mommy's finished now, you've been a very, very good girl.}
<P>__{(to guard)}
<D>__{thanks a lot for looking after her.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{oh, she's been great!}
<A>__{she wheels the stroller over to the door and quickly takes off her high heels, and her hat, and stuffs them into a big bag. she takes out a pair of old shoes and a comfortable jacket, and slips them on. she removes the pins from her hair she looks like her normal self again. she leaves, pushing the stroller out the door. michael stands frozen.}
