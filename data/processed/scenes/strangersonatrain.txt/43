<L>__{interior captain turley's office}
<A>__{captain turley is conscientious, methodical and always polite. he puts aside photographs and records and rises from behind his desk as guy comes in. a detective lieutenant, campbell, is attending a coffee maker. their expressions are grave by contrast with guy's confident attitude after seeing the professor in the waiting room.}
<C>__{captain turley}
<D>__{good of you to be so prompt, mr. haines. this is lieutenant campbell.}
<P>__{(the two nod to each other)}
<D>__{won't you sit down?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<P>__{(he sits)}
<C>__{captain turley}
<D>__{i know you're a busy man, so we won't detain you any longer than necessary...now you already been good enough to tell us where you were last evening, and we've managed to locate the gentleman you spoke with on the train.}
<A>__{turley signals to campbell to call the professor in.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(brightening)}
<D>__{yes. i saw him outside.}
<C>__{campbell}
<P>__{(at open door)}
<D>__{will you come in please, professor?}
<B>__{closeup guy}
<A>__{he looks up eagerly.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{professor collins comes in and sits in a chair opposite guy.}
<C>__{turley}
<D>__{professor collins, this is mr. haines. he was with you on the train last night.}
<A>__{the professor studies guy for a moment, then awkwardly turns to turley.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{i'm terribly sorry, but i really don't remember meeting this gentleman.}
<B>__{closeup guy}
<A>__{surprised. his confident expression fades.}
<B>__{closeup professor collins}
<A>__{he turns from the captain to guy.}
<C>__{collins}
<P>__{(apologetically)}
<D>__{unfortunately, i remember very little about the journey from new york...you see, there had been a little celebration }
<B>__{med. shot group}
<A>__{guy interrupts with a slight note of impatience.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{but we were sitting opposite each other in the observation car! you were singing a song about a goat }
<C>__{collins}
<P>__{(incredulously)}
<D>__{a goat?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(urgently)}
<D>__{and calculus. you were going over a speech you'd made.}
<A>__{turley and campbell are watching closely.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{i was? i'm sorry, mr. halnes.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{i certainly must have celebrated! i can't remember you at all.}
<B>__{closeup guy}
<A>__{momentarily guy is frustrated, then he turns quietly to turley.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(calmly, logically)}
<D>__{captain, is it so important whether or not professor collins remember me? surely, the important thing is that i've been able to name a man who was on the train with me. you've been able to find him. isn't that proof of where i was at nine thirty last night?}
<A>__{guy asks this question with a look of near triumph that he has clearly established his alibi.}
