<L>__{exterior rooftop on eric night}
<A>__{eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him on. eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{and he takes off on a run. only to stumble and fall. but the falls turns into a tumbling roll that lands eric back on his feet still moving. he looks back as if to ask: "did i do that?" and runs out of the frame. another angle picking up eric on the run. as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up. track with him to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain. he jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof. the next roof top is a one story jump down. eric clears the jump with a woof of air. keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining strength. his next leap is more like a broad jump. athletic. fast moving angle the crow keeping airborne, keeping ahead. moving angle eric eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space... up angle from street buildings as eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up where there is no connecting building. close angle target building ledge as eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist, grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him downward. angle at eric from phone cable bracket eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one handed. he hangs for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment, executes a one handed pull up that will save his ass.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{gotcha.}
<A>__{he completes the pull up, bringing his chin level with the ledge. as he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket rips from the wall and eric plummets, with a howl of defeat. up angle from street eric's downfall it's a looooooong way down. angle alleyway as eric lands and splits a trash can in two. a beat as we wonder if any bones are left unpulped. push in as eric rolls from facedown to his back. tight shot eric's face as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one piece. angle trashcan on the crow it flies easily down to inspect eric as he slowly sits up, examining his hands. frustrated and pissed off.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{close up the crow not "your welcome", but other worldly patience. it waits.}
<B>__{resume eric}
<C>__{eric }
<D>__{where're we going next the sewer?}
