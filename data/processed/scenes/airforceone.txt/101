<L>__{interior staff cabin night}
<A>__{marshall frantically searches for something he can use as a weapon. in the room: some video monitors, leather chairs and phones. stainless steel cabinets run the length of one of the walls. marshall throws the cabinet doors open, revealing... a fully stocked medical center... fold down operating table... high intensity lights. equipped to deal with any medical emergency the president might encounter. but too late. vlad kicks the door open.}
<C>__{vlad}
<D>__{get on the floor, now!}
<A>__{marshall yanks down the operating table, and it smashes into vlad, knocking him down. marshall lunges with his knife, but vlad opens fire. a half dozen rounds pump into marshall's belly. he's thrown back against the wall, then slumps to the floor. vlad approaches the crumpled body. leans down to examine his victim. he cups his hand under the man's chin and lifts his head. recognizes him.}

<P>__{(wonderment)}
<D>__{the president.}
<A>__{but marshall's eyes flash open.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{that's right, asshole.}
<A>__{he springs, shoving the butcher knife under the flack jacket and into vlad's spleen. vlad freezes, unsure of what just happened. marshall is on his feet. never letting go of the twisting knife, he grabs vlad by the back of the head and slams his face against the mirror above the surgical scrub sink. the mirror shatters and streams of blood erupt cn the terrorist's face. the blood drips down into the white porcelain sink, swirling into the drain. vlad elbows marshall in the neck, stunning him momentarily. he wipes the blood from his face, spins and hits marshall with a devastating right cross. marshall reels back against the wall, and vlad follows, shoving the mp5 into marshall's throat. marshall grabs the gun near the trigger...}
<B>__{vlad}
<A>__{don't move or i will blow your head off.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{marshall presses the saftey button on the gun with his forefinger, then knees vlad in the balls. viad pulls the trigger repeatedly as he goes down, but nothing happens. instead he comes up swinging his gun butt against marshall's face. like a bat hitting a baseball, it knocks marshall into the medical closet. the gun goes flying, skittering}
<B>__{underneath a cabinet.}
<A>__{marshall pulls himself up the shelves trying to keep his legs from buckling. vlad grabs some i.v. tubing and wraps it around marshall's neck. marshall struggles for breath, clawing at the tube. he spots a defibrillator, reaches and switches it on. low pitched hum and beeping. marshall pulls his head forward, straining against the plastic tubing. then slams back into vlad's head. viad releases his grip just for a moment... the beeping becomes a steady whine. ... but a moment is all marshall needs as he grabs the def ib's cardiac paddles, turns, and slams them on either side of vlad's head. vlad convulses from the shock for a full five seconds... his eyeballs roll, his hair stands on end. then he collapses to the floor.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{clear.}
<A>__{marshall catches his breath for a moment. pulls open his shirt. beneath it he wears a bulletproof kevlar vest. he lifts the vest and a half dozen angry welts have blossomed across his skin. the stuff may be bulletproof, but each of vlad's shots sting like a motherfucker.}
