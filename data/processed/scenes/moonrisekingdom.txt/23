<D>__{scout master's log. september second. first day of search party for sam shakusky. morale is extremely low, in part, i suppose, because sam is, unfortunately, the least popular scout in the troop, by a significant margin. i'm worried, and i'm confused. please, let us find him tomorrow. please, don't let him fall off a cliff or drown in the goddamn lake or something. a terrible day at camp ivanhoe. let's hope tomorrow's better. in fact, i'm going to say a prayer.}
