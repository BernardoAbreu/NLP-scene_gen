<A>__{indiana, willie and short round run through the deserted mine tunnels. they hear a rumbling noise and indy leads them down a side tunnel. they stop and peer into a quarry.}
<L>__{156. interior the quarry cavern}
<A>__{a large cavern is the depository for the mine cars rolling in with loads of rock. emaciated children (still unaware of the re volt and the other childrens' escape) break their backs shoving the heavily loaded mine cars. thuggee guards supervise the deadening work, while others oper ate the pulley and hoist system used to drag the cars up the sloped dump ramp. behind this operation, a thunderous waterfall cascades into a huge cistern. from there, chutes deply the rushing water to power the large conveyor belt below it. as the cars rise up the ramp, they tip and spill rocks onto the conveyor belt which carries them toward an awesome stone cylinder that rolls relentlessly , crushing the rocks into sand. from the side tunnel, indiana watches the noisy operation.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{those empty cars have got to go out of the mines.}
<A>__{willie and short round watch the children push the empty mine cars. the cars gain momentum and roll away down two dark tun nels.}
<C>__{indiana }
<D>__{come on, let's see if we can catch a ride...}
<A>__{tey duck out of the tunnel and run for cover behind a slag heap. loaded mine cars roaring down from the mines hurtle past them and crash to a stop against the cars in front.}
<C>__{indiana }
<D>__{okay, shorty go!}
<A>__{he pushes short round who darts out after a mine car roars past and dodges across the tracks before the next one descends. indy pushes willie into position and holds her ready }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i can't!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{after another car crashes past, indy shoves her. willie runs out her shoe gets stuck and she freezes in the tracks! willie sees a rock filled car blasting down out of a tunnel directly toward her! indiana dives, knocking willie safely to the ground on the other side of the tracks the heavy car hurtles past and crashes into the cars in front. indy pulls willie behind a massive wooden post holding up the dump ramp and they hide from a passing gaurd.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{we've got to get across to the empty cars. wait here until i signal you.}
<A>__{they watch him run and hurdle a pile of lumber, bound up three steps and duck behind a tool shack on the platform. indy reaches out and grabs one of the passing slave children. they see indy put his hand over the kid's mouth and whisper to him. he releases the kid who sneaks away, alerting the other children who start making their escapes into side tunnels. now indy motions to short rounds and willie to follow. as they start to move out they freeze dead in their tracks and indy motions again angrily }
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{willie and short round see a guard coming up the steps on the other side of the platform. as the man rises he gets taller and taller until they see it's a thuggee giant coming up behind indiana.}
<C>__{indiana }
<D>__{come one, what's wrong?}
<C>__{short round}
<D>__{behind you!}
<A>__{indiana turns and looks into the bare chest of the seven foot tall guard. indy has to look up to see the man's mean looking face.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{i see the problem...}
<A>__{indiana suddenly punches the giant in the stomach the giant does not flinch, he just belches rudely. indiana growls and winds up to take a killer swing he steps back, cocks his arm and suddenly turns and runs away. no dummy, indy dashes over and picks up a piece of wood. the giant starts toward him. indy drops the wood and looks around for a much larger piece of wood. as the giant stalks toward him, indiana raises the large piece of lumber indy suddenly groans, drops the wood and clutches his stomach. willie and short round looks startled }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{short round shakes his head. they see indy recover from the spasm as the giant rushes him. indy jumps aside, landing on a loaded mine car that is passing by. the car is being dragged up the dump ramp and the giant jumps out onto it after indiana. indy quickly grabs a rock and, as the giant rushes him, indy smashes the rock against the big man's skull! unfortunately, it's the rock that shatters and not the skull. indy dives to the other end of the mine car and lifts a large boulder. suddenly indy drops the boulder and grabs him arm, feeling a shooting pain again. then he yells as he feels yet another stab bing pain in his left leg.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what's wrong with him?}
<A>__{shorty is convused and worried and then he sees something! he looks up and there on a rock cut balcony over the cavern is the little maharajah! the little prince clutches the clay krtya doll that represents indy. he jabs it in the leg with a long sapphire tipped turban pin. on the mine car, indy yells and grabs his right leg, which collapses beneath him. short round takes off. he dashes under the platform toward a bucket chain carrying spent water back up to the cistern. short round leaps over the pool of water and grabs onto a bucket. he rises up on this make shift elevator toward the rock balcony and the malicious little maharajah. meanwhile, indy is on the brink of unconsciousness as the giant's massive hands throttle his neck. indy's head hangs over the end of the mine car and suddenly his eyes widen the car with indy and the giant reaches the peak of the dump ramp and its upended spilling both of them and a shower of rocks down the conveyor belt! down below, willie dodges wooden pillars and weaves around quarry equipment, trying to follow indy's battle with the giant. she trips and swears angrily willie pushes and empty mine car out of her way an empty mine car! she runs back and starts shoving the mine car along the rails toward the conveyor belt.}
