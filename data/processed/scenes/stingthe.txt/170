<A>__{snyder stands in the middle of a dusty old machine room, surrounded by four or five federal agents. visible around the room are several folding cots and portable lockers. the agents have obviously been quartered here temporarily. they all wear white skimmers, save for one, a portly man, captain polk, who paces the room smoking. there is something long suffering about him, as if he wondered how he ever got in a service that thought white skimmers were classy.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{what is this? i got work to do.}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{sit down and shut up, will ya. try not to live up to all my expectations.}
<P>__{(not in the mood to screw around)}
<D>__{we were told you know a hustle artist named johnny hooker.}
<A>__{snyder doesn't answer.}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{do ya know him or don't ya?}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{yeh, but i don't know where he is.}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{well we do. he's chummin' around with a big c named henry gondorff. ring any bells?}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{sure. every bunco man in the country knows gondorff.}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{there's word he's gonna run a con on the north side here. we got a year old florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold. all we want you to do is pick up hooker for us.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{why don't you pick him up yourself?}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him. if word gets around that feds are in on it too, gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{wouldn't that be too bad. you'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.}
<C>__{polk}
<P>__{(enraged)}
<D>__{don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. i spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off. but it's not gonna happen this time. we're not even gonna let the police know we're here. if you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya. and you better take it, cause i can make ya work for us without it.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{what the hell good is hooker to ya?}
<C>__{polk}
<D>__{he's gonna set up gondorff for us.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{he'll never do it.}
<C>__{polk}
<P>__{(self satisfied)}
<D>__{i think he will.}
