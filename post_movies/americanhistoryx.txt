INT. HOUSE – CLOSED EYES
The young man’s beautiful blues slowly open.   A girl moans
from the next room.
EXT. STREET CORNER – A LARGE TIRE
turns the corner and splashes through a puddle from an earlier
rain. 2PAC SHAKUR blares from inside.
INT. HOUSE – TIGHT ON THE EYES
They snap wide as the woman in the next room MOANS even
louder.
EXT. VENICE BEACH BEACH HOUSE – A WET NIGHT
A slight buzz emanates from the power lines and street lights
above the humble VINYARD household. A black 1986 Jetta GLI
with sharp rims rests in the driveway.
EXT. WET STREET – A BLACK TRANS AM
2PAC’S rapping builds. The window-tinted drive-by slowly
heads down the residential street, cruises past the Jetta in
the driveway, and slows to a stop. The music stops and TWO
BLACK MEN with SKI CAPS spring from the car.
They move with a purpose. The larger figure, crowbar in
hand, moves to the Jetta. The GUN wielding passenger hurries
to the front door and stands guard. Inside the car, a SKI
MASKED DRIVER with WHITE HANDS sparks up a joint.
INT. BEDROOM – DANNY VINYARD’S EYES
The sex happening in the next room makes it difficult for
Danny to sleep. Next to the digital clock that reads 3:07AM,
the clean cut 14-year-old flips to his side.
Danny’s room is decorated with athletic and academic trophies.
One basketball trophy above his head reads "VENIVE HIGH SCHOOL
– FRESHMAN MVP." To the side, a TEAM PICTURE where Danny
holds the ball in the forefront. Another white kid stands
behind – the rest all black.
A whisper from outside grabs Danny’s attention. He sits up
in the dark and looks through the blinds. He SEES the man
trying to jar open the trunk and spots the car with the
driver.
                    DANNY
          Holy shit.
Danny quickly bolts out of his room and into the adjacent
bedroom down the hall. He barges through the door.
INT. DEREK’S BEDROOM – A HUGE AMERICAN FLAG
TIGHT ON DEREK VINYARD. The young man has a shaved head, a
trimmed goatee, and a SWASTIKA on his right tit – the center
of the symbol crossed perfectly at the nipple. On the top
of Derek in the bed is his barely-of-age girlfriend, STACEY.
The covers are completely off and a BLACK ROSE is tattooed
on her shoulder. Danny watches in awe.
                    DANNY
                (softly)
          Derek!
Danny walks over and shakes him.     Startled, Derek forcefully
grabs his little brother’s arm.
                    DEREK
                (controlled)
          What?
Stacey stops and looks over.      Frustrated, she rolls off Derek
and onto her side.
                    STACEY
          Fucking pervert, Dan.
                    DANNY
          There’s a black guy outside
          Der…breaking into your trunk.
Derek, muscled and tattooed, jumps out of the bed and quickly
puts on his skivvies. He reaches under his mattress and
pulls out a SIG 45 semi-automatic pistol. He grabs a pair
of glasses off the night stand and places them on.
                    DEREK
          How long have they been out there?
                    DANNY
          Not long.
                    STACEY
          Who?
                    DEREK
          Nobody.   Relax.
He checks the cartridge.    There are no shells.
                    DEREK
          Shit.   Where are my boots?
                    DANNY
          I don’t know.
Stacey sits up quickly from the bed.     Derek spots his BLACK
COOTS by the closet.
                    STACEY
                (concerned, to Derek)
          Who’s out there, Daddy?!
                    DEREK
          Not right now, honey.   Please.
                (to Danny)
          How many?
                    DANNY
          One…I think.
                    DEREK
          Is he strapped?
                    DANNY
          Huh?
                    DEREK
          Does he have a fucking gun, Dan?
                    DANNY
          I’m not sure.
Derek reaches into the boot, pulls out a seven clip cartridge,
and fists it in.
                    DEREK
          Okay.   Is there a driver?
Danny nods his head yes. Derek quickly slides his feet into
his UNITED BLACK COMBAT BOOTS.
                    DEREK
          Stay the fuck here.
He looks at his girlfriend and says nothing.   She nods with
confidence.
TIGHT ON DEREK. He storms down the hall. The intensity on
his face is alarming. He stops at the front door and grabs
the knob, he walks over to the small kitchen window and looks
out front.
EXT. HOUSE – DEREK’S POV
THE BLACK GUARD turns toward the driveway to see what’s taking
his partner so long.
                    BLACK GUARD
                (whispering)
          Come on, man!
The trunk pops open. The man lifts up a towel and sees a
KILO OF COCAINE. He smiles.
INT. HOUSE – DEREK AT THE DOOR
The guard has his back to him.      Derek thinks, takes a deep
breath, and goes.
EXT. HOUSE – THE DUEL
Derek throws open the door and before the black man standing
guard can wheel, Derek, TOUNGE pressed violently against his
TEETH, buries three bullets in his chest. The force propels
the man six feet backwards.
INT. JETTA TRUNK – THE BAG OF COKE
The other man, stunned by the exchange of gunfire, quickly
grabs the stuff and CHARGES back to the awaiting Trans Am.
In tight skivvies, and without hesitation, Derek buries a
bullet in the other man’s shoulder. The man falls to the
ground, the bag of cocaine dropping safely to the grass.
From the getaway car, the driver fires off a late volley of
bullets but they miss Derek wide. Derek faces the car, walks
towards it, and fearlessly fires shot after shot at the driver
as the car speeds down the street.
INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD – DARKNESS
Davina and Doris Vinyard scream and yell in the background.
Totally oblivious, they can’t place the direction of gunfire.
                    DAVINA
          MOM!!!!
                    DORIS
          STAY DOWN, HONEY!       STAY DOWN!
INT. BEDROOM – DANNY’S POV
From the rain soaked window he watches Derek face his wounded
prey – crawling on the ground. On the ground behind Danny
is Stacey.
                    STACEY (O.S.)
          Get down, Danny!
TIGHT ON DANNY. He curiously stares at his brother from his
bedroom window. Adrenaline pumps through his blue eyes.
Derek, in a manic sweat, hovers over the man. His shadow
moves even closer as the gun reflects off the street lights.
TIGHT ON DEREK’S FACE.    Eyes blistering.     The frame FREEZES.
FADE TO BLACK.
THREE YEARS LATER
                    ANCHOR (O.S.)
          Earlier this evening…LA County
          Firefighter Dennis Vinyard was shot
          and killed while putting out a fire
          in the City of Industry.
EXT. POLICE STATION – EARLY MORNING
A black man in a suit exudes power as he passes two cops,
goes through the automatic doors and into the station. The
news segment plays over the man’s clattering shoes against
the hall floor.
                    ANCHOR (O.S.)
          "The death of a hero", many from the
          community are calling it. But still
          the questions, who and why, remain.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM – SIX DETECTIVES
They all sit in a darkened room and watch the television
screen. The clock on the wall reads 7:33AM. CAPTAIN JOHN
RASMUSSEN, middle-aged with slicked black hair, takes a long
drag off his cigarette and drops it on the floor. DARKNESS.
DR. ROBERT SWEENEY ENTER THE DIM ROOM. His black masculine
face is a combination of power and control. He watches the
t.v. and stares at Rasmussen and the others like they were
once his enemies.
INTERCUT LIVE ACTION WITH VIDEOTAPE
                    RASMUSSEN
                (sarcastically to Sweeney)
          I’m sure you remember this.
Sweeney gives him a look and we shift back to the screen.
EXT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD – A LIVE BROADCAST – VIDEOTAPE
A YOUNGER DEREK, flat top and no tattoos, stands next to the
reporter. Derek wears a Santa Monica City College Basketball
practice jersey drenched in sweat. Towel around neck and
extremely disturbed, he stares at the ground.
                    REPORTER
          To my right I have Lieutenant
          Vinyard’s oldest son Derek.
                (to Derek)
          How do you feel about all this, son?
                    DEREK
                (composed, into the camera)
          "How do I feel?!" Well…I think it’s
          typical.
                    REPORTER
          Typical how?
                    DEREK
          Well...look at our country for
          chrissake. It’s a melting pot of
          criminals. Black... Brown...
          Yellow... whatever.
                    REPORTER
          So you’re saying…the shooting of
          your father is "race" related?
                    DEREK
          Every problem in this country is
          "race" related. It’s either the
          blacks, the Mexican’s, the Chinese...
          Every non-Protestant group in our
          society.
                (then)
          Look at immigration…welfare…AIDS…it’s
          all the fault of the non-white.
INT. POLICE STATION – A GROUP OF DETECTIVES
They all watch the OLD NEWS SEGMENT in awe.    One even smiles.
                    COP #1
          Holy shit.
                    RASMUSSEN
          Classic Derek Vinyard, gentlemen!
          That point right there!
DR SWEENEY rises and walks up to Captain Rasmussen and quietly
stands at his side. Rasmussen acknowledges, albeit
reluctantly.
REPORTER
EXT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD – YOUNG DEREK
He stares at the reporter, anticipating.
                    DEREK
                (interrupting)
          Don’t say poverty right now cause
          that’s not it. They’re not a product
          of our environment either. Minorities
          don’t give a fuck
                    DEREK
                (beep)
          about America! They’re here to
          exploit…not embrace.
INT POLICE STATION – TIGHT ON VARIOUS FACES
Sweeney, Rasmussen, and the rest of the suited detectives
attentively watch the screen..
                    RASMUSSEN (O.S.)
                (over the reporter’s question)
          Once the press got a hold of this…it
          became the Gettysberg address for
          hate groups all across the country.
TIGHT ON THE SCREEN. Derek grabs the mike from the reporter
and explodes in a fit of frenzy.
                    DEREK
          My father was doing his fucking
                (beep)
          job and he got killed because some
          fucking
                (beep)
          nigger (beep) with a gun took
          advantage of the fucking
                (beep)
          system! Plain and fucking
                (beep)
          simple.
Derek stare into the camera, drops the mike to the ground,
and walks over to his mother DORIS. The camera follows him
as he puts his arm around her and escorts her back inside
their Venice residence. The camera pans back to the reporter
who just stands there, speechless.
INT. POLICE STATION – THE SCREEN
Rasmussen ejects the tape from the VCR and the screen turns
to fuzz. Cops chuckle in amazement.
                    RASMUSSEN
          Curtis?   Get the shades, will you?
A voice acknowledges with a "Yes sir" and light leaks in to
the gloomy conference room. Officers in the background
quietly sip hot coffee.
A young MARK FUHRMAN prototype, hungry and slick, gestures
sincerely to his left.
                    YOUNG COP
                (softly busting up)
          This guy’s fucking great!
                    RASMUSSEN
                (continuing intensely)
          Gentlemen. This is Bob Sweeney.
          He’s Principal over at Venice High
          and for some time now he’s worked
          with Crips…in and out of the can.
                    SWEENEY
                (nodding)
          Hello.
                    COP #1
          Where is Vinyard? Is he still at
          Metro Detention?
                    SWEENEY
          Not any more he’s not.
                    RASMUSSEN (V.O.)
          Vinyard just made parole,
          gentlemen…after three and some odd
          years.
                                                  FLASH TO:
EXT. METROPOLITAN PRISON – THE VINYARD’S
Doris, Danny, and Davina wait outside as a few reporters
film in the background.
                    RASMUSSEN (V.O.)
          And Mr. Sweeney has contacted me in
          advance about a possible situation
          that may exist.
Danny walks to meet a long-haired Derek and they smile and
hug. Derek is then hugged by Davina and Doris. Not one of
them loosens their hold.
                    SWEENEY (V.O.)
          Prepare for the worst…cause I have a
          pretty good understanding of what
          these guys have in mind.

INT. STATION – TIGHT ON THE YOUNG FUHRMAN
He smirks at Rasmussen and Sweeney almost like he’s excited.
                    YOUNG COP
          So what are we saying exactly?
                    SWEENEY
          We’re sayin’ that if Vinyard goes
          down…you can expect bloodshed. On
          more fronts than you think.
The concerned group stares at the intimidating Sweeney.
                    COP #1
          Why are we here, Captain?
                    RASMUSSEN
          It’s not exactly LAPD policy but I
          want 24-hour surveillance on Mr.
          Vinyard. For the time being.
                    COP #2
          We don’t have the manpower for---
                    RASMUSSEN
          I know, Lieutenant. But when I hear
          war... I get kind of scared. I’d
          like to say that I at least tried to
          stop it beforehand.
                    SWEENEY
          There are kids out there who have
          been waiting for this day for a long
          time.
                    RASMUSSEN
          So stay on your toes.

EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK – MORNING
PEACEFUL DAY by PENNYWISE blasts on Danny’s walkman
headphones. The day is cloudy and overcast but that doesn’t
bother the local SURFERS. A twosome paddles north to get a
better break on the next set. Danny watches as he skateboards
aggressively down the strand.
His appearance is changed, now resembling a young version of
Derek. He stops for a moment, scratches his head with his
cigarette laden hand, and takes a deep drag.
Head shaved to a quarter of an inch, he wears a PLAIN WHITE
BACKPACK with punk bands scribbled all over it. Your standard
Sex Pistols, DK, The Germs, G.B.H., AND Adolescence in black.
Outlined in red is the largest name, DICK NIXON.

Kids from all walks of life park their cars, lock their bikes

EXT. HALLWAY – TIGHT ON THRASHED LOCKER
Danny throws his SKATEBOARD in, slams the door, and turns to
face LIZZY, a pretty, redheaded freshman.
                    LIZZY
          Hi Danny.
                    DANNY
          Hey.
The two fondly smile at each other.
                                                  CUT TO:
INT. CLASSROOM – A WHITE MALE TEACHER
He sits in front of the quiet STUDY HALL class. A door opens
and a well-dressed boy enters and the teacher a small piece
of paper. The tall, intimidating man looks up.
TEACHER:   Vinyard?
The class knows better than to "ooh" and "aah." Danny grabs
his backpack and casually strolls up to the front. He grabs
the note, snaps his gum, and walks out.
TIGHT ON THE PIECE OF PAPER. Out of all the "time
convenience" choices on the paper, the box checked is "NOW
PLEASE."
                    DANNY
          Shit.
Danny puts his gum in the paper and balls it into a locker.
INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM – A URINAL
Danny smokes a cigarette and pees simultaneously. Outside,
a voice pleads "It wasn’t me!" DARYL DAWSON, pale and thin,
is shoved into the bathroom and he falls to the tiles. LITTLE
HENRY, a young black kid, enters with two of his buddies.
Danny quickly zips and faces them.
                    LITTLE HENRY
                (to a terrified Daryl)
          Little fuckin’ rat, this guy. Tellin’
          bitch Baker I’m fuckin’ cheatin’?
                    DARYL
          I didn’t say anything, Henry!   I
          swear!
                    LITTLE HENRY
          I oughta cap your mother fuckin’ ass
          right now!
Little Henry cracks Daryl in the face and practically knocks
him out with one shot. A bleeding Daryl struggles to his
hands and knees behind Danny as Henry and his pals cackle.
Danny simply defends Daryl by staring into Henry’s eyes and
taking a drag.
After a few moments, Henry and his boys exit.
                                                  CUT TO:
INT. LOBBY – DANNY
He sits in a chair next to an office door marked DR. ROBERT
SWEENEY – PRINCIPAL. Danny glances at the white trash
secretary as she types and talks about Oprah on the phone.
TIGHT ON DANNY. He sighs and quietly listens to the
conversation through the crack in the door.
                    MURRAY (V.O.)
          I do not have a problem with him as
          an individual, alright? I don’t.
                    SWEENEY (V.O.)
          Oh shit Murray sure you do. Let’s
          be honest and maybe we’ll get
          somewhere. You hate this kid.
                    MURRAY (V.O.)
          If I went around hating kids Bob I
          woulda quit this job ten frickin’
          years ago.
                    SWEENEY (V.O.)
          You hate what he stands for.
INT. OFFICE – THE PRINCIPALS
The bespectacled, short-haired MURRAY ROSENBERG, 48, looks
over and spots Danny listening outside. Murray walks over
and shuts the door. He looks at DR. SWEENEY, who now has
his jacket off.
He points to a typewritten report on the desk. It is titled
MEIN KAMPF. "Daniel Vinyard – American History" is in the
upper left hand corner.
                    MURRAY
          It’s genius racism, Bob! At its
          finest! This paper made me sick.
                    SWEENEY
          Murray…it says in your syllabus…right
          here in front of me…that they could
          do their assignment on any book
          related to Civil Rights. Tell me if
          I’m readin’ it wrong. You even
          emphasized the word "any."
                    MURRAY
          That wasn’t my intent.
                    SWEENEY
          Let me finish, Murray! I try to
          give you answers but you keep jumpin’
          in!
                    MURRAY
          Okay.   I’m sorry.
                    SWEENEY
          The fact that he chose Mein Kampf is
          a problem…I’m not disputing that.
                    MURRAY
          His brother probably put him up to
          it.
                    SWEENEY
          I don’t give two shits who put him
          up to it, Murray. He chose a racy
          topic…I won’t throw him out for that.
Murray sighs and takes off his glasses.
                    MURRAY
          Don’t let him walk scot-free here
          like he always does. For his sake
          Bob…not mine. You might be all he
          has left.
                (relenting with a smile)
          we both know the family a little
          better than we’d like to.
                    SWEENEY
                (definitively)
          You more than me, big guy.
                    MURRAY
          Fine.   Please do something though.
Sweeney stares at Murray.
                                                  CUT TO:
EXT. OFFICE   THE DOOR OPENS - TWO MINUTES LATER
Murray walks out and turns back to Sweeney.
                    MURRAY
          Thanks, Bob.
                    SWEENEY (O.S.)
          Okay.   Get in here, Dan!
Danny and Murray make hostile eye contact.
                    DANNY
          I knew it was you.
                    SWEENEY (O.S.)
          Shut up and get your ass in here!
Danny relents.
INT. OFFICE – DANNY ENTERS
Before he even gets through the door he’s chastised.
                    SWEENEY
                (pissed)
          What’s it gonna be, Dan?
                    DANNY
          What’s what going to be?
                    SWEENEY
          I’m sick and tired of all this petty
          shit your pullin’. I’ve had it.
                    DANNY
                (confused)
          Well... I don’t know.
                    SWEENEY
          You don’t know what?
                    DANNY
                (looking away)
          Nothin’.
                    SWEENEY
          You said it, all right.    Sit down.
Danny does what he’s told. Sweeney stares at the teenager,
smirks and leans back in his chair.
                    SWEENEY
                (calmly)
          How are things at home?
                    DANNY
          Fine.
                    SWEENEY
          How’s basketball?
                    DANNY
          You know I quit.
                    SWEENEY
          Yeah I know. But I wanted to hear
          it come outta your mouth.
                    DANNY
          Well now you have.
                    SWEENEY
          Why’d you quit, Dan?
Danny shrugs at Sweeney and looks away. Sweeney takes a sip
of coffee, takes a breath, and continues.
                    SWEENEY
          How’s your brother?
                    DANNY
          Fine.
                    SWEENEY
          Derek was a student of mine…you knew
          that, right?
                    DANNY
          Yeah.
                    SWEENEY
          Honors English. Was one of my
          favorite students. He was very smart
          Dan…like you…but he hung out with a
          bunch of strung-out knuckleheads.
          Also like you. That’s probably why
          he ended up in the can, hunh?
Danny looks at his principal, conceding. Sweeney hold up
Danny’s paper in disgust and shakes his head.
                    DANNY
                (defending)
          Look. Sweeney. I followed
          directions and wrote an "A" paper.
          What happened with Derek has nothing
          to do with me.
                    SWEENEY
          That’s where we disagree, Danny.   It
          has everything to do with you.
                    DANNY
          How so?
                    SWEENEY
          What do you think?
                (after a beat)
          You think these guys have just
          forgotten about everything?
                    DANNY
          Let us get on with our lives, man.
                    SWEENEY
          Hey.   I’m not worried about Derek.
                    DANNY
          Okay then.
                    SWEENEY
          I’m worried about his little brother.
                    DANNY
          Why?
                    SWEENEY
          Why? Look at yourself. I should
          expel you indefinitely right now and
          put your ass in the street.
                    DANNY
          You don’t think I could handle it?
                    SWEENEY
          I think it would kill you. You’re
          not tough. The second a brother
          pulls a gun on your ass you'll be
          hollerin' for Doris.
Danny smirks at the reference.
                    SWEENEY
          So here’s the drill. Take it or
          leave it. I’m your history teacher
          from here on out. This is my class.
          Call it American History... X. I
          see your ass once a day. Any more...
          any less... and you’re a memory at
          Venice High. Clear?
                    DANNY
          Clear.
                    SWEENEY
          Okay. First things first then. I’m
          not even gonna read this bullshit.
                    DANNY
          It took me a week to read Mein Kampf!
          Come on Sweeney! It’s important!
                    SWEENEY
          It’s Dr. Sweeney! And I want a new
          one on my desk tomorrow Dan, or you’re
          gone.
Danny sulks quietly in his chair.
                    DANNY
          Who am I doing it on then... Doctor?
                    SWEENEY
          DEREK…ALAN…VINYARD
                                                  SMASH TO:
EXT. VENICE SHORELINE – LATE AFTERNOON
A series of intercuts shows activity in and around the pier.
A HMELESS LATINO MAN searches in a trash dumpster. OPEN
VENDORS sell tie dye and water bong paraphernalia. A FAT
WOMAN walks past eating a hot dog. BLACK GANG MEMBERS play
basketball in their low-rider shorts and boxers.
TIGHT ON DANNY. He skateboards down the boardwalk, performing
tricks and spinning the board. From afar, he sees the group
of black gang members shooting hoops. He stops, sparks up a
cigarette, and watches them play.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          Venice Beach didn’t always look like
          this. It didn’t. I mean…our dad
          used to take us down here to
          run…before he got shot…and it was
          cool, you know. My brother Derek
          owned this place. Since then
          though…the Crips, man—
Danny stops as LITTLE HENRY from earlier and OLDER BROTHER
JEROME catch their breath. Danny doesn’t flinch. He and
Little Henry exchange cold eyes. Jerome, in a blue bandana,
sips from a 40 oz. Beer. Soon, they both resume playing.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          Jerome Hastings and his little brother
          Henry. I know Jerome’s a Shoreline
          Crip and I’m sure Little Henry’s
          pretty damn close.
TIGHT ON DANNY. He watches the basketball action as he takes
drag after drag off his Marlboro Red.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          The Shoreliners moved west from
          Inglewood and South Central and
          they’ve really just... taken over.
          Especially at my high school. The
          Venice Locos are another big gang
          but they stay in bumfuck Mar Vista
          most of the time. And then there’s
          the The Disciples of Christ. The
          D.O.C... kind of a subdivision of
          the Fourth Reich Skinheads North...
          but gnarlier.
Jerome and Little Henry argue with the players on the other
team. Danny’s cigarette crackles sharply.
                                                  DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BASKETBALL COURT – A GAME – FLASHBACK
The sun beats down on the blacktop. The players are a mixed
assemblage of black and white, jumbled together on different
teams.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          My brother Derek was pretty much the
          backbone to D.O.C….before all the
          bullshit.
TIGHT ON DEREK. He has a shaved head, a GERMS t-shirt on,
and eye goggles. Derek brings the ball upcourt as LAWRENCE,
a monstrous black man in a blue bandana, blatantly HAND CHECKS
him.
                    LAWRENCE
          Bring it on, boy.
Derek yo-yo-‘s the ball in place and grins at this irony.
                    DEREK
          President Lincoln was a good man,
          hunh?
                    LAWRENCE
          Fuck you.
Derek blows by Lawrence easily for a left handed layup.   Big
Lawrence fouls him hard but it still goes in.
                    SETH
          Ten a piece!     Nice left, Daddy.
The chubby SETH RYAN slaps Derek’s hand enthusiastically as
they get back on transition. Derek’s stares at Lawrence as
long-haired CAMMERON ALEXANDER, in a GREEN BAY PACKER JERSEY,
STP HAT and JEANS, also congratulates him.
                    CAMMERON
          Beautiful fucking left!
                    LAWRENCE
          Let’s go, O!     All we need is one!
Lawrence and Derek lock eyes, a look exceeding competitive
boundary. A look filled with rage.
                    DEREK
          Dee up now, Seth!    Use that fat ass
          and keep him out!
Seth and the opposing player bang to get position underneath.
                    LAWRENCE
                (to Derek)
          This is my house! And I ain’t fuckin’
          losin’ in my house! Clear it out!
The six-five POWER FORWARD dribbles beautifully up the court
– his teammates clearing out the key. Defensively, Derek is
solid.
                    DEREK
          You got nothin’. You do the same
          move every time.
                    LAWRENCE
          You mean this one?
He tries to pass Derek but Derek’s defense is stifling.
With another tricky move, Jerome inadvertently puts his LEFT
ELBOW into Derek’s face, sending him quickly to the pavement.
Everybody stops.
                    SETH
          That’s fuckin’ offense!
                    CAMMERON
          All the way!
                    LAWRENCE
          Get the fuck outta here!   He was
          movin’ his feet!
A bleeding Derek rises, diplomatically.   He stares at the
bigger player.
                    DEREK
                (threateningly)
          I’ll go if you want to.
                    LAWRENCE
          What’s that?
                    DEREK
          If you wanna go…let me know.    Don’t
          be throwin’ fuckin’ elbows.
                    SETH
          Derek?
                    LAWRENCE
                (smiling)
          I think that would be a mistake,
          man.
                    DEREK
          I don’t give two fucks what you think.
                    DEREK
          Just let me know if you want to.
                    SETH
          Derek!   Come on, man.
                    DEREK
          Shut the fuck up, Seth!
                (to Lawrence)
          What’s it gonna be?
                    LAWRENCE
          Jesus, man.     It was an accident,
          a’ight?
A bleeding Derek removes his goggles and walks over to Danny
and short-haired STACEY standing courtside. She has a water
bottle and a towel for him. He wipes his BLOODY LIP with
the towel, takes a sip, and kisses her. Cammeron, sweating
hard from his heavy attire, stares at the two.
                    CAMMERON
                (grimacing)
          Father V? Are you copacetic?
Derek ignores him and looks at Danny and Stacey.
                    DANNY
          You gotta call offense on that.
                    DEREK
          Not on point game you don’t.
                    STACEY
                ((gesturing to Lawrence)
          Fuck that, Daddy. That chucker can’t
          be doin’ that shit…especially to
          you.
                    DEREK
          Not on point, honey.
He turns back to the court and walks over to Big Lawrence.
He stands in front of him and checks the ball in. Cammeron
looks over his shoulder at the beautiful Stacey. She looks
back, uncomfortably.
                    DANNY (O.S.)
          Dee up, Cam!
                    DEREK
                (to the group)
          Tens! Dee up right now!       Ball in!
Lawrence takes the ball, passes it to the wing, and quickly
gets it back. Lawrence dribbles up top, makes a marvelous
180 spin with the ball, and pulls up for a ten foot jumper.
It’s REJECTED by Derek.   Derek grabs the ball off the fast
break and DUNKS IT.
                    DANNY
                (amazed by the dunk)
          Holy shit!
Everybody courtside goes nuts, especially after the last
exchange of words.
                    DEREK
                (to the other team)
          Fuck you! Get off my court!    This
          is my house!
Seth, Cam, and his other teammates congratulate him. Derek
STARES DOWN a recovering Lawrence and the rival team. He
walks to the sideline and slaps his brother’s hand.
                    DANNY
                (smiling)
          Yeah! Fuck…yeah!
Derek takes a drink of water, spits it out, and says nothing.
Players randomly come up and pat him on the back. "That was
your show" from a friendly looking black man. Derek doesn’t
even acknowledge him. Then, an admiring "nice game" from a
few other dorky whites. Derek nods.
DANNY’S POV. He watches Cammeron from afar talk to a
recovering Lawrence. Danny notices cam stare back over
Stacey, methodically. He looks at an approaching Seth.
                    SETH
                (to Derek)
          I hear you got the "mother load."
                    DEREK
          Intervene in something like that
          again you fat tub of shit and I’ll
          kill you.
                    SETH
          Oh.   You will, hunh?
                    DEREK
          What do you think?
                    SETH
          All right.
Seth looks at him and walks away with his tail between his
legs. Danny watches Stacey congratulate Derek with a kiss.
                    STACEY
                (pulling off slightly)
          What "mother load" is he talking
          about?
                    DEREK
          Nothin’. Don’t worry about it.
                (smiling to Lawrence)
          Goddamn! How sweet it is!
Young Danny proudly stares at his brother.
                                                  CUT TO:
EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK – PRESENT – DANNY’S POV
Danny awakens from his daydream. The black players now stare
at him. Danny puts his board down and skates down the
boardwalk.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          Cammeron told me once that the Crips
          would take America over one day.
          That white people are all too afraid
          to stand up for themselves. Maybe
          he was right.
EXT. SMALL BEACH HOUSE – A PATIO
Danny skates up to the gate and shoots his board up to his
hand. He passes two SURFBOARDS on his way towards the back.
EXT. SIDE ENTRANCE – TWO 14-YEAR-OLDS
Stoned LIZZY, the redhead beauty from earlier, and her blond
friend KAMMI, stumble out and laugh.
                    KAMMI
          Hey Dan!
                    DANNY
          Hey.
Lizzy is immediately on him as Kammi sparks up a cigarette
in the background.
                    LIZZY
          You going tonight, right?
                    DANNY
          Where?
                    LIZZY
          That party.
                    DANNY
          What party?
                    KAMMI
          Liz!    Come on! We’re late, man!
                    LIZZY
          Go there.   I wanna see you.
The two girls take off.
INT. TINY, MESSY BEDROOM   A BONG
JASON, a 17-year-old punk with a shaved head, holds the bong
in one hand and a lighter in the other. He sings a verse
from INSTITUTIONALIZED BY SUICIDAL TENDANCIES on the stereo.
His partner in crime, CHRIS, sprinkle COCAINE on the top of
the bong load and Jason finally lights it. The two wear the
pants of their full wetsuits – with the tops hanging down.
                    DANNY (O.S.)
          There’s dick for waves.
                    CHRIS
          I don’t care. I just wanna get wet.
Jason sucks it through, clears it, and holds it in.   The two
quickly turn behind them and face the bed.
TIGHT ON DANNY. He sits on the sandy, unmade bed and spins
a basketball on his finger.
                    CHRIS (O.S.)
                (continuing to Dan)
          So what was this now?
                    DANNY
          Henry Hastings almost beat the shit
          out of Daryl Dawson. He would’ve
          too if—
                    CHRIS
          Little Henry the negroid?
                    DANNY
          Yeah.
                    JASON
          Daryl Dawson is a pussy faggot.
He stops and looks at Jason as he exhales.
                    CHRIS
          Want a "Coco-Puff," Vinyard?
                    DANNY
          I already told you.   I gotta bail.
                    JASON
                (smiling)
          You’ll be able write that fuckin’
          bullshit paper in ten minutes on
          this shit, dude. Guaranteed.
                (reacting to the hit)
          You’ll be able to take on the fucking
          world, man!
                    CHRIS
          One puff to get the juices flowin’?
Danny thinks to himself and stands up.
                    DANNY
          I can’t.    I have to do this shit.
                    CHRIS
          You don’t have to do anything, dude.
                    DANNY
          Yes I do.
                                                  CUT TO:
EXT. BOARDWALK – DANNY, JASON AND CHRIS – LATER
The three skateboard down the strand, Jason and Chris with
their surfboards and suits. Ahead an OLD DRUNK WHITE WOMAN
tows a succession of SHOPPING CARTS. As Jason passes, he
smacks her with his surfboard and knocks her to the ground.
They all laugh and Danny breaks off and heads east on Rose.
                                                  CUT TO:
INT. DUMPY APARTMENT – A PINK BLANKET
DAVINA VINYARD, the raspy middle sister, takes the wretched
blanket and carefully places it over DORIS, her sleeping
mother. There’s a knock on the door and Davina, in a large
UCLA T-SHIRT and panties, rushes to get it.
INT. APARTMENT – THE OPENING OF A DOOR – NIGHT
She opens the door and tries to shut it immediately. FAT
SETH, from the game earlier, forcefully pushes it back open,
a BOX in hand.
                    DAVINA
          What are you doin’ here?
                    SETH
          Gotta take a shit, bitch.     Step aside.
                    DAVINA
                (examining him)
          Jesus!
                    DAVINA
          Are you sure you can fit through the
          door?
                    SETH
          Fuck off.
Seth pushes inside, passes Doris, and heads down the hall.
EXT. DUMPY APARTMENT – NIGHT
Danny skates up to his residence and looks at a car across
the street. Two plainclothes cops from the earlier meeting
sit in their car and attempt to be inconspicuous.
INT. THREE BEDROOM APARTMENT – DANNY ENTERS
The apartment is messy but still has the traces of a woman’s
touch. He peeks inside the living room and sees Davina in a
chair doing homework. His mother DORIS sleeps on the couch
opposite.
                    DAVINA
          What’s up?
                    DANNY
          Nothin’.    How is she?
                    DAVINA
          She’s sick.
He turns and walks down the hall.    On the left he opens up
the bathroom door.
INT. BATHROOM – THE CAN
Seth sits on the toilet and toys with a VIDEO CAMERA. The
empty box sits on the floor. Danny stares at Seth’s GUN on
the bathroom counter.
                    SETH
          What are you lookin’ at?
                    DANNY
          I’m still trying to figure it out.
                    SETH
          Come in here and I’ll show you,
          maggot.
                    DANNY
          Fuck off.    When’d you start carrying?
                    SETH
          Hey. I’m dropping the kids off at
          the pool, junior. Shut the damn
          door!
Danny quickly grabs his nose.
                    DANNY
          You need to go to the doctor!
He slams the bathroom door and faces the closed bedroom behind
him.
INT. BEDROOM – DANNY’S POV
He opens the door and hesitates. His muscular brother Derek
stands there in jeans and black boots. LONG HAIR slicked
back to his shoulders, everything about him is different
now. He looks through THE CLASSIFIEDS.
                    DANNY
          What’s up?
THE PHONE RINGS IMMEDIATELY. Derek glances up at his brother,
turns around and grabs the receiver. Above Derek is Danny’s
surfboard, hanging on ropes hooked to the ceiling.
                    DEREK
                (into the receiver)
          Hello. Yeah? Hi.
Across Derek’s back is a massive tattoo that reads
"PECKERWOOD." All the smaller tats covering his arms and
shoulders are inconsequential next to PECKERWOOD. Soft music
quietly plays in the background. DANNY STARES AT THE TAT.
                    DANNY
          Who is that?
                    DEREK
                (into the receiver)
          Can you hold on a minute?
                (to Danny without turning)
          What’s up?
                    DANNY
          The pigs are outside.
                    DEREK
          I know. I think they got me around
          the clock.
Derek cautiously leans over the computer, looks through the
blinds, and stares at the UNMARKED CAR.
                    DEREK
                (quickly)
          Is Seth here yet?
                    DANNY
          Yep.
                    DEREK
          Okay.   I’ll be out in a few minutes.
Danny throws his backpack on the bed and exits.   Derek puts
his ear back up to the receiver.
                    DEREK
          Yeah.   Sorry. What’s up?
INT. BATHROOM – TIGHT ON SETH
He points his Glock 9mm at the mirror. The thick kid grabs
the camera, points it at the mirror, and films himself.
                    SETH
          Drop the t.v., nigger.
He smiles, reaches over and flushes the toilet.
INT. LIVING ROOM – CONTINUE ACTION
Danny walks through the living room and sees his mother asleep
on the couch. Doris, once beautiful, is now aged and graying.
NYQUIL, PEPTO BISMOL, two PRESCRIPTION CONTAINERS, and a
spoon rest next to her on the coffee table. FAMILY MATTERS
IS ON THE TELEVISION. Davina hasn’t moved.
                    DANNY
          Turn the channel, Davina.
                    DAVINA
          No.   It helps her sleep.
Seth walks out of the bathroom, into a small dining room,
and looks at Davina’s revealing panties.
                    SETH
          Turn that shit, brainchild.
                    DAVINA
                (under her breath)
          Whatever you say…FREE WILLY.
TIGHT ON SETH. Small tattoos completely cover Seth’s
forearms. A BLOODY SNAKE is halfway tucked under his black
t-shirt. Gut lightly hanging out, the bald skin stares
through the view finder of the brand new 8mm camera.
                    SETH
          This thing is fuckin’ sick, man.
          Two hundred speed... playback view
          finder—
INT SMALL KITCHEN – VIDEO CAMERA POV
He focuses on Davina’s CROTCH.
Seth pans back to Danny as he walks in the kitchen and look
through the refrigerator. He pulls out a leftover piece of
steak and gnaws on it.
                    DANNY
                (chewing)
          Goin’ to Cammeron’s party tonight?
                    SETH
          Is Davina’s ass water tight?
Danny laughs.
                    DAVINA
          Hurry up and leave, Goodyear.   You’ve
          taken your dump now go.
                    SETH
                (smiling at Danny)
          Listen to her. You callin’ me a
          blimp, you fuckin’ Democrat?!
                    DAVINA
          Yes!
Danny takes a bite and laughs at Seth.
                    SETH
          Hey.   Keep Cameron’s house fuckin’
          low.
                    DANNY
          I’m already there.
                    SETH
          Oh yeah?   You ask Derek?
                    DANNY
                (begging)
          Noo... but... he’s got two kegs.
                    SETH
          Well... you can think of me drinkin’
          ‘em then when you’re studying with
          fuckin’…White Trash in there.
Davina scoffs and Seth refocuses the camera on her.
                    DANNY
          That girl’s goin’, too.
                    SETH
          Ask Derek, dude. Where is he? I
          haven’t even seen the fucker yet.
Davina finally looks up from her homework and catches the
pervert. He quickly moves the camera back to Danny.
Davina crosses her legs and looks at Seth, shocked and
disgusted.
                    DAVINA
          You’re not even human.
                    DANNY
                (to a laughing Seth)
          Is Cam still playing with DICK NIXON?
                    SETH
          Yep.
Seth drums his hands on the dining room table. Danny takes
another bite off the steak – smearing barbecue sauce all
over his mouth. Seth points the camera at Dan.
                    SETH
          Hey. Hold still.      I wanna ask you a
          few questions.
                    DANNY
                (looking into the lens)
          I got homework, Seth.
                    SETH
          Two fucking seconds, dude! I wanna
          see how this thing records.
Danny sits across the table from Seth.    He looks uncomfortably
into the lens and takes another bite.
                    SETH
          Okay.   Tell me your convictions.
                    DANNY
          Excuse you?
                    SETH
          Tell me some of the shit you believe
          in fuckbrain before I pistol-whip
          you.
Danny thinks as he looks into the camera.
VIDEO CAMERA VIEW – BLACK AND WHITE
The barbecue sauce all over his mouth looks more like blood.
                    DANNY
                (smiling)
          Okay. I believe in death and
          destruction and chaos and filth and
          greed.
                    SETH
          What else?
                    DANNY
          I believe in the Disciple of Christ.
                    SETH
          Are you absolutely, 100 percent
          positive?
                    DANNY
          Yes.
                    SETH
          What else?
                    DANNY
          I believe in my family.
                    SETH
          Why?
                    DANNY
          "Respect your father and your mother.
          Whoever curses your mother and
          father... is to be put to death."
          Matthew 15-
                    SETH
          Good. What else? Tell me what I
          want to hear, ass hole.
                    DANNY
          I don’t know what you wanna hear.
                    SETH
          Yes you do.
                    DANNY
          You mean that stuff about your mother?
Davina CACKLES in the background.
                    SETH
          You’re just begging for a beating.
Danny smirks and sparks up a cigarette, unfazed.
                    SETH
          Do you believe in Adolf?
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAVINA
She puts down her homework and looks over at Seth.
                    DAVINA
          Seth?   Cut it out.
                    SETH
          I’m not fuckin’ talkin’ to you,
          Davina, shut up!
                (filming Danny)
          Do you believe in Adolf?
                    DAVINA
          Get the hell outta here!
Doris stirs—
                    DORIS
          Davina, please.
                    DANNY
                (to Davina)
          Yes! I believe in Adolf!
Seth smiles at the youth and speaks intimately.
                    SETH
          Who do you hate, Danny? Tell the
          millions of people watching.
                    DANNY
          I hate everyone that isn’t white
          Protestant.
                    SETH
          Why?
                    DANNY
          Because they’re a burden to the
          advancement of the white race. Some
          of them are all right... the one
          that are productive... but—
                    SETH
          None of them are fuckin’ productive,
          Danny. Get that in your head right
          now. They’re all a bunch of
          freeloaders. Now... what don’t you
          like about them?
                    DANNY
          I feel threatened by them.
                    DAVINA
          They feel threatened by you.
                    SETH
                (ignoring her)
          What else, Danny? And speak
          intelligently you little queer faggot.
Davina’s attention is unwavering.
                    DANNY
          I hate the fact that it’s cool to be
          black these days.
                    SETH
          Good.
                    DANNY
          I hate this fuckin’ hip hop influence
          on white fuckin’ suburbia.
                    SETH
          Good!
                    DANNY
          I hate Tabitha Soren and all of the
          Zionist MTV pigs telling us we should
          all get along. Save the rhetorical
          bullshit, Miss Hilary Rodham Clinton.
          It ain’t gonna happen.
Seth stops filming and looks at the young man.    He smiles at
him with distinct revelation.
                    SETH
          That’s the best shit I’ve ever heard
          come out of your mouth.
TIGHT ON DAVINA.   She stares at the two hate mongers.
                    DAVINA
                (from the living room)
          I feel sorry for you, Danny.    You
          don’t stand a chance.
                    SETH
          Shut up, Davina.
                    DAVINA
          You shut up, you poison to society.
          Get out of our house.
                    SETH
          Your brother requested my presence.
                    DAVINA
          Derek hates you, Seth.    Haven’t you
          figured it out yet?
                    DEREK (O.S.)
          How do you know who I hate, Davina?
TIGHT ON DEREK VINYARD – SILENCE.
He’s a striking presence with his scruff, tight t-shirt and
tats hanging down his arm. A rundown jacket wraps around
his waist.
                    DAVINA (O.S.)
          I just know.
                    DEREK
          Maybe you do.
Derek removes a cigarette and lighter out of Danny’s shirt
pocket and sparks it up. Seth stands and smiles at his old
friend.
                    SETH
          How are you, man? Fuckin’ A. Long
          time no see. Look at that fuckin’
          hair.
Derek virtually ignores Seth’s greeting.
                    DEREK
                (to Danny)
          Did you do a book report on Mein
          Kampf?
                    DANNY
          Yeah.
                    DEREK
          Why?
                    DANNY
          I don’t know. Because I felt like
          it.
                    DEREK
          Oh. You felt like it? Well I feel
          like smacking you. Would you mind
          if I did a report on that?
                    DANNY
                (like Butthead)
          Uhh…yeah.
                    DEREK
          Get a fucking clue, you idiot.
                    DANNY
          How’d you find out about it?
                    DEREK
          None of your fucking business.
                    SETH
          I thought it was a pretty good idea.
                    DEREK
          That figures. You’re even more
          stupid.
                    SETH
          It’s great to see you too, Der, you
          fuckin’...
Derek stares down at Seth – who’s too afraid to finish.
Derek looks back at Danny.
                    DEREK
          Don’t be a dick. Sweeney cares about
          you.
                    DANNY
          Was that him on the phone?
                    DEREK
          Yep.   So wise up.
                    SETH
          Sweeney’s a fuckin’ nigger on a power
          trip, Vinyard. That’s what he was
          like when we were there and that’s
          how he is now. It’ll never change
          either. A nigger is a nigger.
                (pointing the camera at Derek)
          Now smile and say... "monkey."
                    DEREK
          Give me the camera, Seth...
Derek stubs his cigarette in the ashtray
                    SETH
          Let me play Dan back for you.
                    DEREK
          I already heard enough.   Give me the
          camera.
                    SETH
          I want to see you through this.
                    DEREK
          Seth? You have three seconds to
          give me the goddamn camera before I
          strangle your fat ass.
                    SETH
          I think it’s extremely important
          that you hear this though, Der.
          Come on!
Derek quickly clasps Seth’s NECK and forces him out of his
chair and to the ground.
                    SETH
                (begging)
          Son of a bitch! Okay!     Jesus Christ!
Seth releases the camera and Derek grabs it.
                    SETH
                (recuperating)
          Fuckin’ asshole, man.
Derek checks out all of its function.
                    SETH
                (desiring approval)
          Go ahead, man. I stole it for you.
Derek puts the camera up to his eye.
IN SLO MO – DREAMLIKE SEQUENCE
Derek pans the camera around the kitchen and stops at assorted
pictures of the family. Derek focuses on a FAMILY SHOT of
Doris, Derek, Danny, Davina, and DENNIS VINYARD.
TIGHT ON DENNIS. The handsome man smiles in a coat and tie.
Derek PANS to a picture of a dirty and rugged Dennis and a
young Davina, wearing her father’s FIRE HELMET.
Derek pans the video camera. He stops on Danny who’s now in
the sink washing barbecue sauce off his hands and face.
Derek concentrates on the RUNNING WATER. The sink faucet
becomes a POWERFUL SHOWER FAUCET crashing down.
He turns off the camera and hands it back to Seth.
                    DEREK
          Here.   Keep it.
A bewildered Seth stares at him.
                    SETH
          You’re bein’ weird, dude.
                    DEREK
          Oh yeah?
Derek’s tongue presses against his teeth.   Fear sparks in
Seth’s eyes as Derek approaches.
                    SETH
                (afraid)
          What the fuck did I do?
                    DAVINA
                (sensing danger)
          Derek?
Doris suddenly starts in with a COUGHING ATTACK.   Derek stops
and the moment is lost.
                    DORIS (O.S.)
          What time is it!?
Derek walks into the living room and sits down beside his
sick mother. Everybody follows.
INT. LIVING ROOM – DORIS ON COUCH
The middle-aged woman is half asleep on the couch. Caught
under a severe spell of the flu, Derek CARESSES her head.
                    DEREK
          Where’d you get this couch?
                    DAVINA
          Piece of shit garage sale.
Derek checks out a significant tear on the right cushion.
                    DEREK
          We gotta get the hell outta here.
                    DAVINA
          Sounds good to me.
                    DORIS
                (softly, once more)
          What time is it?
                    DEREK
          Night time.    Are you going to live?
                    DORIS
          I think so.    I need a cigarette.
                    DEREK
          No way. You smoke three packs a
          day. That’s why you’re spittin’
          phlegm.
Doris coughs once again and spits green into her napkin.
                    SETH:
                (astonished)
          Jesus Mrs. Vinyard.   I think a lung
          just came up.
Everyone laughs.
                    DEREK
          That’s good though.   Get all of that
          mucus outta there.
                    DEREK
                (after a beat)
          Just wait until we take off, will
          you?
Everybody laughs – including Doris.   Derek tenderly puts his
hand on his mother’s cheek.
                    DEREK
          You’re drowsy from all those drugs.
                    DORIS
          I’m high as a kite is what I am.
                    DANNY
          You got any more?
                    DORIS
          Daniel?   I know you got homework to
          do.
                    DANNY
          I’m goin’ in a second!    Relax.
                    SETH
                (interjecting to Derek)
          Hey. I’m puttin’ the camera in your
          room and we’re outta here.
Derek hardly acknowledges as Seth walks down the hall.
                    DORIS
                (whispering to Derek)
          I don’t like him in this house.
                    DEREK
          I know you don’t.
                    DAVINA
          He’s a fuckin’ loser, Nazi scumbag.
                    DANNY
                (defending)
          No he’s not.
                    DEREK
          Yes he is.   Open your eyes.
Danny looks at Derek, perplexed.
                    DANNY
          Why are you goin’ out with him then?
                    DEREK
          Why are you so curious?
                    DANNY
          Can’t help it.
                    DEREK
          Try.
Danny pats his brother on the shoulder and walks off.
                    DANN
          Okay.    I’ll see you later then.
                    DEREK
                (over his shoulder)
          Not at Cammeron’s you won’t.
                    DANNY
          Come on, Der! It’s gonna be—
                    DEREK
          Forget it, Danny! It ain’t gonna
          happen for you tonight.
                    DAVINA
          Is Stacey gonna be there?
Derek looks at her, caught completely off-guard.
                    DANNY
                (back to Derek, diverting)
          Can I use your computer?
                    DEREK
          Go ahead.
Danny walks off, crosses Seth’s path, gets shoved into the
wall, and reacts like it’s an everyday occurrence. Derek
kisses Doris’ forehead, smiles and stares into her eyes.
DEREK’S POV – TIGHT ON A SMIRKING DORIS.
MATCH CUT TO:    INT. PRISON VISITING ROOM – DORIS – FLASHBACK
She holds a receiver to her ear, a look of false strength in
her eyes.
                    DORIS
          Are you making it okay?
Derek sits opposite from Doris and nods, not wanting her to
think otherwise.
                    DORIS
          How’s the biker? Keeping an eye out
          on you I hope.
                    DEREK
                (nodding again)
          Jimmy’s a good man.
                    DORIS
          Davina got accepted to UCLA last
          week.
They share a long, magical smile.
                    DEREK
          Make sure you put some of that money
          towards it.
                    DORIS
          I’m planning on it.    Even though I—
                    DEREK
          Mom?    Relax. It’s going to good
          use.    What about Dan?
                    DORIS
                (after a beat)
          I don’t know. He says he’s good
          but... Cammeron’s name keeps popping
          up.
TIGHT ON DEREK’S EYES.    That’s the last thing he wanted to
hear.
                    DORIS (O.S.)
          I can’t monitor him all day, Derek.
          I wish I could but I can’t. He needs
          you.
                                                  BACK TO:
INT. VINYARD APARTMENT – PRESENT
Derek smiles at his precious mother.
                    SETH (O.S.)
          Hey?    Are you back on fuckin’ earth
          yet?
                    DEREK
          What?
                    SETH
          Can we go soon?
                    DEREK
          Yeah. Right now.
                (to the girls)
          I’ll be back early.
Derek looks out the front window. He sees the two cops
outside, oblivious. Derek follows Seth out the SIDE WINDOW
as if it was planned. They jump and quickly dart down the
alley.
INT. APARTMENT – TIGHT ON DORIS
She thinks to herself and closes her eyes.
Derek looks at the COPS and drops into the passenger’s seat.
Seth starts the engine and drives away.
                                                  CUT TO:
INT. DANNY’S BEDROOM – A DESK
Danny’s attention is everywhere except his homework.    He
walks back out of his bedroom.
INT. HALLWAY – DANNY’S POV
He watches Davina complete her homework on the couch.    Doris,
on the sofa opposite, tries to sleep.
                    DANNY
          Hey.
                    DAVINA
          Hey what?
                    DANNY
          Come here.
                    DAVINA
          What?
                    DANNY
          Come here for a second!
Danny looks at her. The wiry, pretty scholar sets her
homework aside and follows him down the hall into…
INT. BEDROOM – TWO SINGLE BEDS
She sits on the edge of DANNY’S bed.   Danny hands her his
syllabus.
                    DAVINA
          I got shit to do, Dan.
                    DANNY
          Just read it.
She sighs and begins to read it out loud.
                    DAVINA
          "American History X.
                    DAVINA
          Take home paper as assigned by
          Principal Robert Sweeney."
                (to Danny)
          Why is he giving you homework?    What
          happened to Murray Rosenberg?
                    DANNY
          Just read the thing.
                    DAVINA
          "Describe in detail your opinion of
          the historical event that took place
          in the early morning of October 4th...
          199" What’s that?
                    DANNY
          What do you think it was?
                    DAVINA
          I didn’t know it was like this.
                    DANNY
          I know.
                    DAVINA
                (continuing her reading)
          "Before and after…how has this event

          blah blah blah.
                (to Danny; amazed)
          He can’t do this.
                    DANNY
          It’s already done.
THE PHONE RINGS. Davina quickly reaches over to pick it up.
Danny stares hard at his sister.
                    DAVINA
          Hello? Hello? Yeah?
                (after a beat)
          What do you want, you fuckin’ --?
Danny snatches the receiver from her.
                    DANNY
          Who is this?
                    DAVINA
                (upset)
          That same asshole who keep callin’.
Danny hangs it up.
                    DANNY
          What did he say?
                    DAVINA
                (afraid)
          He doesn’t say anything!
                (then, referring to the paper)
          What do you want from me on this?
                    DANNY
          Will you do it?
                    DAVINA
          Eat me, Dan.
                    DANNY
          Come on! Dick Nixon’s playin’ at
          Cammeron’s tonight.
                    DAVINA
          Forget it!   I have a spreadsheet
          due.
                    DANNY
          Goddammit!
Davina walks to the door and looks back to her brother.
                    DAVINA
                (frustrated)
          What’s the matter with you? You
          wanna be a loser your whole life?
Not receiving a response, she walks out the door.
                    DANNY
                (to himself)
          Fuckin’ asshole Sweeney.
TIGHT ON DANNY. The frustrated kid sits and thinks to
himself. He slowly begins to strike the computer keys.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          People look at me... and they see my
          brother.
                                                  CUT TO:
EXT. UCLA CAMPUS ALLEY – AFTERNOON – FLASHBACK
TIGHT ON SKINHEAD DEREK.    He looks at a newspaper and reads
to himself.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
                (snapping the keys)
          That’s how things have transpired
          since my father was murdered.
Derek now reads the article out loud.
                    DEREK
                (smiling)
          "University Officials approved over
          $15,000 in funding for the Gay and
          Lesbian Student Union, The Bruin
          learned yesterday."
                (looking up from the paper)
          This is fucking hilarious!
He looks over at SETH who kicks a man as he painfully lies
on the ground. The man wears a PINK POLO SHIRT. Derek’s
tongue presses hyperactively against his front teeth as his
boot strikes the helpless man after Seth.
                    DEREK
                (reading in disbelief)
          "Robert Gibbons, President of the
          G.L.S.U., declared the funding a
          major victory for gay students across
          the nation."
A smiling CAMMERON stands in the b.g. in a white COWBOY HAT
and a DALLAS COWBOY JERSEY #8 with "Aikman" on the back.
Cam has his arm around Danny.
                    DEREK
                (to Cammeron)
          Can you believe this shit?
                    CAMMERO
          It makes me wasn’t to vomit.
DANNY’S POV. He stares at the sobbing man as he rolls around
in pain. Cammeron laughs as Derek KICKS him again.
                    DEREK
                (reading)
          Said Gibbons – "Gays are one of the
          most pivotal on-campus organizations
          and we..."
                (frustrated, to the man)
          What the fuck are you saying!?
                    CAMMERON
                (to the man)
          You’re such a pretty little thing.
          You know that?
                    SETH
          He’s beautiful.
                    DEREK
          How about I interview you, you little
          flamer? Hunh?
                (then, smiling)
          Do you like big red nipples that
          stick out a half fuckin’ inch? Do
          you?
Derek kicks the tortured man – dirtying his shirt further.
                    SETH
          Fuckin’ pink shirt faggot pussy.
                    DEREK
          How about a thin, beautiful back?
          With tiny little freckles?
Derek kicks him again – tongue pressed against teeth.
Cammeron continues to laugh.
                    DEREK
          A tight, wet pussy?! How could you
          not like a tight, wet pussy?!
The man cries and yells on the ground as Derek kicks him
again and again and again. Danny observes his brother’s
power as horrified STUDENTS watch from afar.
                    SETH
          Instead you prefer a nice, hairy,
          ass.
Seth kicks the man a final time.
                    CAMMERON
                (laughing)
          With pimples all over it.
                (looking up)
          PIGS!
Simultaneously, two SQUAD CARS turn the corner and sound
their sirens. The four quickly scatter.
TIGHT ON A FLEEING DANNY. He sprints alone through the side
of a building. He enters an alley and, anticipating another
SQUAD CAR, jumps into a DUMPSTER.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          President Gibbons, A.K.A King Faggot,
          turned out to be a huge pain in the
          ass.
EXT. ALLEY – TIGHT ON BOBBY GIBBONS
He lies on the ground, motionless.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          My brother got 30 days... Seth ten...
          Cammeron – a slap on the wrist.
                                                  DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. CAMPUS ALLEY – NIGHT
Nobody around. The scene is serene compared to earlier.
DANNY CRAWLS FROM THE DUMPSTER and walks down the alley.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          Soon after, Derek—one of the four
          Grand Fathers of the Fourth Reich
          North—quit and formed the more
          militant Disciples of Christ.

Danny sparks up another cigarette and types on the screen
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          The sixty or so Disciples followed
          my brother’s word like it was the

EXT. VENICE BEACH HOUSE – A RAINY NIGHT – FLASHBACK
As the rain falls we see the Vinyard's sitting at the table.
Stacey and Murray Rosenberg, Doris’ then boyfriend who we
met earlier, round out the clan. Stacey sits close to Derek.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          Then came October 4th.
Doris looks wonderful. And Mr. Murray Rosenberg is a far
cry from his present clean-cut image. PONYTAIL and BEARD,
Murray stares at Derek talking away.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          Everything was fine at the time. My
          Mom had a good job and a new
          boyfriend…her first in a while. We
          had a four bedroom house six blocks
          from the beach that Dad set us up
          with. Everyone was happy.
TIGHT ON DEREK. His hair is longer on his face than on his
head. His head is completely shaved.
A wife-beater cotton tank top, tattoos, nose and ear rings,
wire-rimmed glasses. His charisma draws their attention as
he rambles over the crackling rainfall.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          Everyone but Derek.
                    DEREK
          White men don’t cruise the streets
          of LA killing each other, Murray.
                    MURRAY
          No.   You guys make bombs.
Derek stares at the man, eyes filled with homicide.
                    DEREK
          White Americans don’t take P.C.P.
          and drink and drive a hundred and
          twenty fuckin’ miles an hour! That’s
          reality. We pull over and trust the
          law.
                    MURRAY
                (smiling)
          You are kidding, right?
                    DAVINA
                (sarcastically)
          Don’t you know, Murray? White people
          never break the law. We’re perfect
          little angels.
                    DEREK
          That’s not what I said, Davina.
                (to the group)
          Three different times Rodney King
          comes at those officers with the
          intent to hurt them. To hurt them!
          Three times! But since we see it on
          some fucking tampered videotape...
          the bleeding heart media makes you
          believe that he only comes at them
          once. All we see is Powell... Koon
          and Wind hittin’ him and...
                (busting up laughing)
          Briseno kickin’ him in the back of
          the fuckin’ head with his boot.
          Still…the dumbfuck’s tryin’ to get
          up and kick their asses! That’s how
          stupid that mother fucker is. They
          used textbook-solid tactics and if
          Dad were still here he’d say the
          same damn thing.
                    DORIS
          That doesn’t make it right.
                    DEREK
          Yes... it does. Cops are taught to
          use that stick and they did.
                    MURRAY
          Excessively.
                    DEREK
          Appropriately. Cops demand authority
          and white people... unfortunately...
          are the only ones who give it to
          them.
                (after a beat)
          Even I acknowledge a cop’s authority.
Davina starts to laugh.
                    DAVINA
          Look who’s talking about respecting
          the law? MR. K.K.K. HERE.
                    DEREK
          That’s two errors in one sentence,
          Davina. First error – I didn’t say
          I respect the law. I said I respect
          a cop’s authority. Second error...
          I’m not a member of the fuckin’ Ku
          Klux Klan. Pull your head outta
          your ass.
                    MURRAY
          Don’t speak to her that way, Derek.
          Come on.
                    DEREK
          Murray, stay out of it. You’re not
          a member of this family and you never
          will be.
                    MURRAY
          What the hell does that have to do
          with anything?
                    DORIS
          You know, sometimes it’s hard to
          believe that I gave birth to you.
                    DEREK
          If dan was walking across the street
          that night and Rodney King plowed
          into him—
                    DORIS
          Forget about Rodney King for
          chrissake!
                    DEREK
                (fiercely continuing)
          –while wasted on Chias and P.C.P...
          You’d consider the force those cops
          used to be justified.
                    DORIS
          He didn’t hit anybody!
                    DEREK
          If he did though! If that shithead
          killed Dan... you would have believed
          the beating to be justified and so
          would everybody else. But since he
          didn’t hit anyone... it’s "Hand’s
          Across America" for the son of a
          bitch. It’s a "modern day, do
          anything to help the struggling black
          man society," and we’re all fucking
          suckers to it.
                    STACEY
          I’m with you, honey. All the way.
          It’s one... giant... ploy.
                    DAVINA
          Here we go.
                    STACEY
          I mean... nobody likes Chief whatever
          his name is, right?
                    DAVINA
          Gates.
                    STACEY
          Yeah. So here comes this filthy
          piece of garbage in a hyundai. He
          pulls over in front of a perfectly
          lighted area where a video camera is
          sitting there…fucking waiting for
          him, man. What happens next? Chief
          gates is dust. It’s total—
Davina drops her silverware on the plate with a clatter and
looks at her mother. Everyone stares at Davina.
                    DAVINA
                (to Doris)
          May I be excused please?
                    DEREK
          Don’t interrupt, Davina.
                    DAVINA
          I didn’t interrupt shit.
                    DEREK
          The hell you didn’t. I was listening
          to Stacey and then I heard you.
          That’s called interrupting. Wait
          til’ she’s finished and you can be
          excused.
                    DAVINA
          Who the hell do you think you are?
Derek jumps up from the table and grabs her by the back of
the hair. The table JOLTS and plates drop to the floor.
                    DEREK
          You don’t know when to shut up, do
          you?
                    DORIS
          Goddammit Derek!
                    MURRAY
          Come on, Derek! What are you trying
          to prove, man?! Jesus!
Derek turns and laughs at Murray.
                    DEREK
          I’m trying to teach my sister some
          respect, Murray.
                    DAVINA
          Let go of my fucking hair!
                    DEREK
                (to Murray)
          See! See the way she speaks!
                (softly to Davina)
          Tell me you’re gonna shut up and
          I’ll let you go.
                    DORIS
          Derek!   Let go of her hair and sit
          down!
                    DEREK
          I will when I hear an answer, Doris.
          Tell me, Davina.
                (softly)
          Are you going to shut up?
TIGHT ON DANNY. He gets up quickly and tries to pull Derek
off. Derek turns and cracks Danny in the face with a
BACKHAND, dropping him back into a cabinet. A crystal vase
with flowers crashes to the floor, just missing Danny’s head.
                    MURRAY
          Jesus!
                    DEREK
                (to Danny)
          What are you thinkin’?
                    DORIS
          Danny?   Are you okay?   Derek!
Danny nods his head as everyone looks at Derek.
                    DEREK
                (to Davina)
          Are you going to shut up so Stacey
          can finish or what?
                (sympathetically)
          It’s a real easy question, Davina.
          A simple yes or no will suffice.
          Tell me what I want to hear and I’ll
          let go.
                    DAVINA
          Fuck…you.
Derek takes a piece of roast beef off her plate and shoves
it in her mouth. He holds the whole piece inside so she
can’t spit it out. Davina cries as she chokes on the meat.
MURRAY:   She can’t breathe, Derek!
                    DEREK
          Stay back, both of you! It’s her
          bed…she’s gotta lie in it.
                (grabbing harder)
          You can cry all you want, Davina.
          I’m not gonna let go until you tell
          me what I wanna hear! Are you going
          to shut that fat fucking mouth of
          yours and let my girlfriend tell her
          opinion?
                (exploding)
          Are you?!
DORIS grabs him from behind and he aggressively turns on
her. Derek curled his tongue behind his teeth and raises
his arm like he’s actually going to smack his mother. She
grabs his arm though, forcefully.
                    DORIS
          Let go of her hair and sit down.
Derek releases his grip on his sister and she spits the roast
beef onto the floor. She runs in the back bedroom crying,
choking and coughing.
                    DAVINA (O.S.)
          I hate you, you fucking asshole!
The door slams shut in the background. Doris, Murray, Danny,
and Stacey all stare at Derek. Derek calmly faces his
brother.
                    DEREK
          You okay?
Danny nods.
                    MURRAY
                (softly)
          Psycho.
IN SLO MO – Time FREEZES as Derek slowly turns his head back
to Murray. ON THE TRACK we hear a few keys being typed and
then silence. A cigarette sizzles.
                                                  CUT TO:
INT. BEDROOM – DANNY THINKING – PRESENT
He takes a long drag off his cigarette and exhales. He slowly
runs his hands over his stubbly head, marveling at the past.
BACK QUICKLY TO:
INT. DINING ROOM – TIGHT ON DEREK – FLASHBACK CONT.
Derek smiles at Murray in wonder and disbelief.
                    DEREK
          Would you care to repeat that, Murray?
          I’m not sure I got all of it.
                    STACEY
                (smiling)
          He called you a "psycho", honey.
                    DEREK
                (smiling back)
          Was that it? Golly.     Thanks Mur.
                    MURRAY
          See. Here we go again with this,
          Derek. Making me out to be the bad
          guy again.
                    STACEY
          You callin’ me a liar, RosenKike?
                    MURRAY
                (to Stacey)
          Hey goddammin! You talk to me with
          respect or--!
                    DEREK
          Or what, Murray!?
                    DEREK
          What’re you gonna do?     Give her
          detection?
                    DORIS
          I want both of you outta here.
Murray stares at Derek with pity.    Doris becomes emotional.
                    DORIS
                (to Derek)
          Do you think you’re the only one
          that hurts around here?
Derek focuses on his mother for a moment. A captivated Danny
watches and waits as Derek turns to Murray.
                    DEREK
          Out of respect for my mother…I’m
          gonna let that go, Murray. I won’t
          bash your face in. But let me tell
          you somethin’... man to fuckin’ mouse
          here. Normally in a situation like
          this I’d take my steeltips to your
          fucking temple. That goes for anyone
          making comments about me... my
          family... Stacey…whomever. You know
          and I know that I could crush that
          puny fuckin’ skull of yours in a
          second. So it’s beyond me why you
          would say something like that without
          being able to back it up? What’s
          worse, you sack of shit, is you
          calling the woman I love a liar.
                    MURRAY
          I never said she was a liar.
A fed up Derek stares down Murray and puts out his cigarette.
                    DEREK
          Weasel like that again Murray…you
          fuckin’ ponytail, pussy, bagel eating,
          teacher, faggot... and I’ll cut your
          nose off. Make no mistake.
Murray silently walks out of the house. Derek claps and
signs the Jewish celebration song "Hava Naghila Hava." Stacey
joins in and the two laugh. Doris goes after Murray.
                    DEREK
          My problem is…Dad’s corpse is still
          warm.
Doris stops in her tracks and slowly turns around.
                    DORIS
          Don’t you ever disrespect your father
          like that.
Derek looks at her and realizes he’s said and done something
wrong.
EXT. HOUSE – DANNY’S POV
Murray hyperactively bangs his fists on top of his wet car.
Rain crashes down as Doris approaches from the lawn.
                    DORIS
          He’s a kid, Murray.
                    MURRAY
          He’s a kid, my ass Doris! We were
          kids! We didn’t…call people kikes!
                    DORIS
          It’s gonna take some time with him!
                    MURRAY
          You don’t know your children, Doris!
          You don’t know the world they live
          in! (then, truly believing) Your
          son is a terrorist.
                    DORIS
          He is not a terrorist!
                    MURRAY
          He’s founder of The Disciples of
          Christ! Louis Farrakhan has gotten
          death threats from the Disciples.
          Alan Dershowitz. Mayor Bradley.
                (then)
          My sister and her two kids got
          evacuated from her Temple in Woodland
          Hills!!!
                    DORIS
          Murray! Please! Derek would never
          have anything to do with bombs, okay?!
          You don’t know him like I do.
                    MURRAY
          I wouldn’t want to know him like you
          do, Doris.
Murray gets inside and drives down the street.
INT. HOUSE – DANNY
He watches Doris as she stands alone in the rain. BEHIND
Dan a humiliated Davina storms toward Derek wielding a
BASEBALL BAT.
                    DANNY
                (stunned)
          Davina?
Derek hears Dan and looks out of the corner of his eye.    He
spots her at the last moment.
                    DAVINA
          Take this, you fucking dick!
Derek pops up quickly, disarms her, and pulls her close.
                    DEREK
          Davina! It’s okay! Calm down.
          Please.
                (whispering in her ear)
          I’m sorry, okay? Come on.
                    DAVINA
          Let go of me!
                    DEREK
          Come on Davina, I’m sorry. I lost
          control. Come on. I screwed up.
          Please.
Derek holds tight until the crying girl settles down. He’s
gripped as desperately by remorse as he was moments before
by rage. He kisses and repeats his apology over and over.
Finally, she succumbs and puts her arms around him. Derek
looks to Danny.
                    DEREK
                (hugging Davina)
          You guys are my life…and I’d do
          anything for you. You do know that,
          don’t you?
                    DAVINA
                (wiping her cheek)
          I don’t know anything anymore.
                    DEREK
          I swear to God I would, Davina.
                    DANNY
          I believe you.
Derek smile at his little brother, lovingly.
                    DEREK
          Davina?   Please forgive me.
                    DAVINA
                (nodding, after a beat)
          That sucked, Derek.
                    DEREK
          I know it did. And I’m sorry.
                (then, referring to Murray outside)
          I just really hate that guy.
                    DAVINA
          I couldn’t tell.
Derek kisses her, walks over to the front door, puts his arm
around Dan, and looks at his mother outside.
                    DEREK
                (whispering in his ear)
          Don’t take sides against me like
          that again.
                    DANNY
          I won’t.   I’m sorry.
                    DEREK
          Dad’s gone to a better place so he’s
          not here to help any of us. Treat
          me with respect and I’ll do the same
          with you.
                    DANNY
          Okay.
                    DEREK
                (still whispering)
          Go against me though... and I’ll do
          my Lawrence Powell imitation on you.
A RAINSOAKED DORIS walks through the front door, disgusted
with her son.
                    DORIS
          Find an apartment because I want you
          out of here.
                    DEREK
                (shocked)
          WHAT? THE GUY’S—
                    DORIS
          I don’t care what he is.   I want you
          out.
                    STACEY
          He can move in with me.
                    DORIS
          When?
                    STACEY
          Tomorrow.
                    DORIS
          Good.
She walks past Derek and he watches, suddenly filled with
remorse.
                                                  DISSOLVE TO:
INT. BEDROOM – TIGHT ON DANNY’S EYES – PRESENT
He rises from the computer and PEEKS out the blinds. The
two cops supposedly watching Derek are now eating in the
car. One of them looks up. Danny flips the blind down and
exits.
INT. KITCHEN – THE FRIDGE
Danny grabs the gallon of milk and chugs straight from the
container. The phone rings and Danny is quick to answer.
                    DANNY
                ((into the receiver)
          Yeah.
                    MAN (V.O.)
          It’s me, Dan.
                    DANNY
          Who’s Me?
                    MAN (V.O.)
          You know.
Danny stretches the cord and checks out his mother and sister.
Both snooze on the two couches.
                    DANNY
                (softly)
          Look asshole. It’s getting’ really
          old.
                    MAN (V.O.)
          He’s fucking dead, Dan.
A dial tone.
                    DANNY
          Hello?
Danny quietly places the phone on the hook and thinks about
the threat.
Doris immediately goes into a coughing attack in the living
room. Danny hears this, fills a glass with water and brings
it to her.
                    DANNY
          Here.
                    DORIS
          Thank you, honey.
She coughs, recovers, and sips.   Danny walks away.
                    DORIS
          Hey. Come here. Sit down for a
          second.
                    DANNY
          I’ve got this thing to do.
                    DORIS
          You can sit down for two seconds.
                    DANNY
                (sitting)
          Don’t breathe on me.
                    DORIS
          I won’t.
They share a smile.
                    DANNY
          What?
                    DORIS
          What?   I’m not allowed to look at
          you?
He smothers her face with his hand, jokingly.
                    DANNY
          No.   You’re not.
                    DORIS
                (laughing)
          Daniel Patrick! Stop it!
                (softly)
          Are you ever gonna let that beautiful
          hair grow back?
                    DANNY
          Nope.   Never.
He smiles, rises and walks back towards his room.
                    DORIS
          If you need me to proof anything...
                    DANNY
          I think I can manage.
                    DORIS
          Okay.    Wake up early if you get tired.
Doris watches him disappear down the hall, distant thoughts
creeping back slowly.
INT. BEDROOM – DANNY
He searches through his closet, finding a secret scrapbook.
The LA TIMES news clipping reads "Prominent Skinhead Charged
with Murder." The accompanying picture of Derek is near
evil.
TIGHT ON HIS EYES.    Danny stares at the clipping.
                                                  CUT TO:
INT. BEDROOM WINDOW – THE EYES – FLASHBACK
He watches Derek, in his SKIVVIES, fire his gun at the TRANS
AM as it blazes down the street. He walks over to the wounded
man on the lawn and points his weapon.
                    STACEY (V.O.)
          Get down, Danny!!!!
Danny looks at her and hurries out of his room.
EXT. HOUSE – TIGHT ON DEREK.
He hovers over Big Lawrence. Gun pointed steadily, he kicks
him in the stomach over and over – tongue pressed against
teeth. Hot air flows from Derek’s breath and into the cold.
                    DEREK
          Did you follow me from the courts?
          Answer me, motherfucker!
Derek answers the silence with a gunshot to the leg.   The
man screams in agony.
                    LAWRENCE
          Goddamn, man!
                    DANNY (O.S.)
          Derek!     What are you doin;?!
                    DEREK
          Get in the house, Dan!
Danny is now outside watching his older brother.
                    DANNY
          Let the cops handle it, Der!
                    DEREK
          He won’t talk to the cops!
Derek grabs Lawrence and drags him by the shirt to the corner
of the CURB.
                    DEREK
          He will talk to me, though. Won’t
          you?
                (while dragging)
          Ever shoot at firemen, you fuck?
                    LAWRENCE
          I don’t know shit, man!     I swear!
                    DEREK
          We’ll soon find out. Open your mouth
          and put it on the corner of the curb.
                    DANNY
          Derek!?
                    DEREK
          Get in the fucking house, Dan!
                    DANNY
          No!
                    LAWRENCE
          Come on, man. Call an ambulance.
          I’m dyin’ here. Please.
                    DEREK
          How did you know, asshole?
                    LAWRENCE
          Know what, man?
Derek kicks the man in the stomach.
                    DEREK
          Don’t fuck with me. You know what.
          You planned this shit at the courts.
          Put your mouth on the curb. NOW!
He cocks his piece and Lawrence complies—his teeth scraping
concrete.
                    DEREK
          How did you know there was shail in
          the trunk? I’ll put your brains all
          over this fucking sidewalk!
SIRENS sound from afar. Danny walks out into the middle of
the street to check it out.
                    DANNY
          The cops are comin’, Der!
                    DEREK
                (to Lawrence)
          Three seconds. Two seconds... one
          second...
                    LAWRENCE
                (mumbling)
          That cowboy!
                    DEREK
          The cowboy?
                    LAWRENCE
          Please. Man.
Derek shakes his head slowly side to side.    Danny takes a
few steps closer from the street.
                    DEREK
          Sorry.
                    DANNY
                (anticipating)
          Nooo!
Derek STOMPS his foot on the back of LAWRENCE’S head –
completely tearing his jaw in half on the curb’s corner.
                    DANNY
          Holy fucking shit! Derek!      What the
          hell was that for?! Jesus
                (losing it)
          Why’d you do that?!
The two look at each other. Derek analyzes himself – a gun
in one hand and a key of coke in the other. Danny checks
the man’s condition.
                    DANNY
          He’s not moving, Der.
A shattered Derek looks blankly at his brother.
                    DANNY
          What do you want me to do?
                    DEREK
          I don’t know.
                    DANNY
                (looking at Lawrence))
          Jesus Der…I think he’s dead.
Danny grabs the bag of blow – relieving some of the burden.
As SIRENS near, Danny heads towards the house.
                    DEREK
          Danny?
                    DANNY
                (turning back)
          What?
Derek takes his time answering, drunk with confusion.
                    DEREK
          What happened?
Danny runs inside the house. The women scream from the other
room. He quickly pans the house for a hiding place. Nothing.
He spots a PLANTER on the back porch as a HELICOPTER now
hovers above.
Copter lights shine briskly through the house’s windows.
Obnoxious sirens blare and TIRES SCREECH OUTSIDE.
DANNY’S POV. He watches a lone cop take cover behind his
door. The officer draws his gun and waits for backup. Derek
and the cop stare at each other.
Without instruction, Derek drops the gun, turns around, puts
his arms behind his head, and drops to his knees facing Danny.
The two brothers share a look of reckoning.
                                                  CUT TO:
EXT. WET STREET – THE CRIME SCENE – LATER
DANNY’S POV. FIVE PATROL CARS, a FIRE TRUCK, TWO AMBULANCES,
and a throng of terrified NEIGHBORS strangle the front of
the house. Clothed and handcuffed, Derek is escorted from
the house by a uniformed cop and RASMUSSEN. Derek marches
past the bodies – which are being tended to thoroughly.
Derek watches Lawrence dying, unable to fathom what he has
done.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          Twenty minutes later Bobby Lawrence
          died of massive head trauma. Six
          months after that... Derek was
          sentenced to seven years for voluntary
          manslaughter at the Metropolitan
          detection Center in Los Angeles.
Rasmussen forces Derek’s head down and he sits in the car,
staring at his family.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          Prosecutors wanted murder one for my
          brother’s torture method... but there
          wasn’t enough "premeditated" evidence.
                                                  CUT TO:
INT. BEDROOM – DANNY’S EYES
They clearly focus on the article as he sits at the computer.
He types the sentence "There might have been if I testified"
but then decides to delete it.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          Over the next year we’d lose out
          house and most of our father’s pension
          to attorney fees. My mother... much
          to my surprise... stood by Derek
          throughout.
Danny’s interrupted by a LOUD KNOCK on the front door.   He
quickly grabs a MACHETE from his closet.
INT. FRONT HALL – DANNY’S POV
He looks through the PEEPHOLE and sees it’s CHRIS AND JASON.
He sighs in relief and opens the door.
                    JASON
          We’re here, dude.
                    CHRIS
          Grab your stick and drop your dick.
                    DANNY
          I told you assholes I can’t tonight.
                    DORIS (O.S.)
                (from the couch)
          Danny?
                    DANNY
          It’s okay, Mom.
                    JASON
          Does Mommy want her baby to do his
          homework?
                    DANNY
          Fuck off.
The two punks laugh as Danny pushes them and their boards
back to his bedroom. He shuts his bedroom door.
INT. BEDROOM – THE THREESOME
Danny looks at the two.
                    DANNY
          What do you guys want?
                    JASON
          Cruise over there with us.
                    DANNY
          If I don’t finish this thing I’m
          dead.
                    CHRIS
          Just tell ‘em you’ll do it tomorrow,
          alright? You can’t miss this party.
                    JASON
          Fire pie Lizzie called and told us
          to grab your ass.
                    DANNY
          Did she?
                    CHRIS
          You gotta fuck that freshman shit.
          You’re not eighteen yet.
The PHONE RINGS ONCE AGAIN.      Danny quickly picks it up.
                    DANNY
                (into the receiver)
          Look dickwad! Stop fuckin’ callin’
          here!
INT. DARK OFFICE – TIGHT ON SWEENEY
The only illumination shines through the window from the
street. Holding his briefcase, he stands over his desk phone,
all packed up and almost out the door.
                    SWEENEY
          Dan?
                    DANNY (O.S.)
          Yeah.
                    SWEENEY
          Dr. Sweeney.
                    DANNY (O.S.)
          Oh, shit. I mean... golly.       I’m
          sorry, sir.
                    JASON
                (softly to Danny)
          Who is that?
INTERCUT THE CONVERSATION
                    SWEENEY
          Is everything okay over there?
                    DANNY
          Everything’s fine.
                    SWEENEY
          How’s it comin’?
                    DANNY
          I’m workin’ on it.
                    CHRIS
          Who is that?
                    DANNY
                (covering the receiver)
          It’s Sweeney.
                    CHRIS
          Who?! Why is he calling here!?
                (then, loudly)
          Fuck you, Sweeney! Asshole!
                    JASON
                (grabbing the receiver)
          Get a fucking job, you---!
Danny grabs the receiver back and yells at his friends.
                    DANNY
          You fuckers are going to get me
          booted!
                (into the receiver)
          Dr. Sweeney? I’m sorry man. That
          was…uncalled for.
                    SWEENEY
          If that paper isn’t on my desk
          tomorrow Dan…you’re gone.
                    DANNY
          It’ll be there.
                    SWEENEY
          It better be.
                    DANNY
          It will, alright!
Sweeney hangs up. Danny slams the phone on the hook and
gives it THE FINGER.
                    DANNY
          Fuck you!
EXT. CAMMERON’S HOUSE – NIGHT
Danny, Chris and Jason skate up to the party and cruise
inside.
INT. SETH’S TRUCK – ACROSS THE STREET
Derek and Seth sit in the car as a band JAMS from Cam’s house.
Seth wolfs down a cheeseburger as Derek grabs a BASKETBALL
from the floor and grips the familiar object.
                    SETH
                (feeding his face)
          You’re an idiot if you ask me.
                    DEREK
          Well... I’m not asking you.
Derek spins the ball on his finger and Seth, hands all greasy,
knocks it to the floor.
                    SETH
          What if he writes something stupid
          and fuckin’ Sweeney turns you in?
          I’ve seen D.A.’s reopen cases over
          shit like this.
Derek takes a long stare at Seth.
                    DEREK
          I’ve done my time, Seth. Down the
          road... you’ll probably do yours.
                    SETH
          What the fuck’s your problem, dude?
                    DEREK
          You’re my problem, Seth.
                    SETH
          I’m the least of your problems.
                    DEREK
          You’re the root of my problems.
Seth takes the last bite, smiles and stares at Derek.
                    SETH
          You’re serious.
                    DEREK
          Yeah I’m serious. I’m finished with
          this shit. I’m done.
                    SETH
          What exactly are you "done" with?
                    DEREK
          You know exactly.
                    SETH
          I can’t believe I’m hearing this
          shit come out of your mouth.
                    DEREK
          Spend three years of your life locked
          in a cell and then talk, Seth. You
          don’t know shit until you’ve done it
          and you haven’t. Over three years
          of my fucked up life are lost. And
          for what?
                    SETH
          You’re a piece of shit, scumbag,
          traitor.
Seth walks inside to the party. Derek sparks up a cigarette
and observes a shadow-cloaked female enter the party.
                    STACEY (V.O.)
                (reading)
          Hi Daddy. I was just thinking about
          how much I love you. So…I decided
          to pick up a pen and let you know
          what I’m thinking and feeling.
                                                  CUT TO:
INT. PRISON CELL – LATE NIGHT – FLASHBACK
A sweaty, longer haired Derek lays on the top bunk with
glasses and the night light on. He stares at the letter as
his HUGE ROOMMATE sleeps below.
                    STACEY (V.O.)
                (reading)
          I go to work... I go to bed... I go
          on with my life. Despite all my
          emptiness... I go on. But I hurt.
          I really, truly hurt.
                (after a beat)
          I don’t want to hurt anymore, Derek.
          I won’t.
TIGHT ON THE BALLOON. There are two tiny needle holes poked
into the bottom where heroin had leaked out.
The guards arrive at the scene as Derek stands. Derek looks
over at Stevie and his smirking gang. He charges over but
is restrained by a pair of hulking guards. Derek struggles
with rage as Stevie waves before disappearing.
                                                  CUT TO:
INT. PRISON CAFETERIA – DEREK
He eats alone.   STEVIE and his HUGE ARYAN bodyguard join
him.
                    BIG ARYAN
          We’re sorry about your friend, man.
Derek looks at the smiling monster but says nothing.
                    STEVIE
          You need us now, Derek.    You got no
          one else.
                    DEREK
                (after a beat)
          You guys actually like it in here,
          huh?
                    BIG ARYAN
          You gotta wise up, little man.
                    DEREK
          Go fuck yourselves.   Both of you.
Derek looks at the men, grabs his tray, and rises.
                    STEVIE
          Be careful, Derek.
Derek walks to a different table and sits alone as inmates
from all walks of life look on.
                                                  CUT TO:
INT. PRISON QUAD – A BRUTALLY HOT DAY
TIGHT ON DEREK
He plays basketball with mostly black prisoners. A BLACK
INMATE looks over to STEVIE AND HIS GANG and Stevie nods at
him IN A "BE MY GUEST, FASHION." The man pulls a pipe from
his backside and heads toward Derek.
Just as Derek grabs the ball off the rim, the black man hits
him with the bar across the back. Prisoners circle and three
other BLACK MEN join in and beat Derek with pipes as he rolls
on the ground. One of the prisoners KICKS a bloody Derek
when he tries to GET UP.
                    BLACK KICKER
          Stay down, motherfucker!
DEREK’S POV. Oblivious, dizzy, and beaten, Derek sees the
four blurry prisoners dressed in LAPD UNIFORMS. They continue
to whale on him, a la Rodney King.

INT. SETH'S TRUCK – TIGHT ON DEREK – PRESENT
He flicks his cigarette out the window, gets out of the car,
and slowly walks across the street to the party.
INT. CAMMERON’S HOUSE – THE FRONT DOOR
DICK NIXON plays the song ‘BIG BLACK WOMAN" and skinheads
slam dance. DANNY joins the crowd, skanking violently.
EXT. CAMMERON’S BACK PATIO – A SKINHEAD
His face is tattooed with crow’s feet and prison ink.
CASSANDRA, a frail, English woman with green hair and a huge
nose ring approaches the skin filling his beer at the keg.
                    CASSANDRA
                (over the music)
          I think you’re full of shit!
                    OLDER SKIN
          Have you even looked yet?
                    CASSANDRA
          Of course I’ve looked, you wanker!
INT. HOUSE – MORE SLAMMING
Chris and Jason pound beer and huck DARTS at a picture of
O.J. SIMPSON. Seth violently slams past the kids while Derek
stands in the b.g.
                    CHRIS
          Yo!   What’s up, Fat Seth?
Seth throws him against the wall.
                    SETH
          I’M NOT FAT, COCKBREATH!
                    CHRIS
          Okay!   I’m sorry, bro!
                    JASON
          Take it easy, dude!
Seth then grabs Jason and tosses him like a dart to Chris’
side. Both kids stare at him, alarmed. Seth releases them,
mixes into the party, and SLAM DANCES into ten other skins.
DEREK STANDS AT THE ENTRANCE. He looks around the room and
analyzes the seedy crowd. JASON recuperates and looks at
Derek.
                    JASON
          Are you lost, dude!?
Derek says nothing.   Quickly, Chris recognizes him.
                    CHRIS
                (softly, to himself)
          Holy shit!
Derek turns to walk away but he’s stopped by Chris.
                    CHRIS
          Father Vinyard?
                    DEREK
          What?!   Piss off.
It’s obvious the two kids are on COCAINE by the way they
move their jaws and talk.
                    CHRIS
                (excited)
          Son of a bitch motherfucker!    I didn’t
          even recognize you, sir!
                    DEREK
                (competing with the music)
          Don’t call me "sir!"
                    JASON
          I’m Jason and that’s Chris!    We’re
          friends with your brother!
They both stick out their hands but Derek doesn’t even
acknowledge them.
                    CHRIS
          You are fuckin’ god, man!   I’m
          sorry... but you are!
                    JASON
          No doubt!
                    DEREK
          Don’t you two have homework or
          something?
The two boys look at each other and LAUGH.
                    JASON
          School doesn’t exist anymore, Father.
                    DEREK
          Don’t call me "father."
Chris pulls out a cigarette and sparks it up.
                    CHRIS
          I wrote you. Two letters while you
          were in there! Did you get them?
                    DEREK
          Chris Jones?!
                    CHRIS
          Fuckin’ A! I thought for sure they
          confiscated that shit.
                    DEREK
          Yeah…I got them. But I threw them
          away. You got the I.Q. of a dial
          tone, kid.
The boys laugh at Derek like he’s joking around.
                    CHRIS
          You’re kidding, right?
Derek ignores and weaves his way through the crowd, causing
many individuals to double-take.
EXT. LARGE, OPEN SHED AREA – A CROWD
In the corner, the band performs in front of a white sheet
banner spray painted with the name DICK NIXON. Derek spots
partygoers sitting on a TOTALLES TRANS AM. The windows are
knocked out and he recognizes the vehicle instantly. He
stares for a beat, turning to the DRUMMER.
                    CASSANDRA
          Fuckin’ great, man! I didn’t even
          recognize you with this doo!
                    DEREK
          Oh yeah?
                    CASSANDRA
                (volunteering)
          It’s too fuckin’ long, Der! I like
          the whiskers but you gotta chop that
          mop.
Cassandra pulls out a brown menthol cigarette.   Derek quickly
pulls out a lighter and lights it.
                    CASSANDRA
                (exhaling)
          Stacey’s meandering around here
          somewhere! Have you seen the bitch?!
Derek lies and shakes his head.
                    DEREK
          The only person I’ve seen is Seth.
                    CASSANDRA
          Oh God.   I’m sorry.
DEREK’S POV. When he turns to face Stacey, he sees Cammeron
descend from the tiny stage. Cam puts his arm around her as
if she’s his main squeeze. Knowing Derek’s watching, Stacey
pushes Cam’s arm OFF. Cam tells her to "fuck-off" along
with a few other indignities. Cammeron then acknowledges
that Derek saw them together.
Derek watches, stunned, as Danny delivers a beer to Cammeron
and the two make their way into the house.
                    LIZZY (O.S.)
          Excuse me?   Are you going in there?
Derek looks down to see two very young girls.
                    DEREK
          Why?
                    LIZZY
          Can you tell Danny that Lizzy’s
          looking for him? Derek can only
          stare at the girl’s youth.
INT. BEDROOM – DANNY AND CAM
Cammeron leans over the small table in the messy bedroom and
quickly sniffs TWO LINES OF COKE through each nostril. Danny
stares at the large BAG OF COKE on the table.
                                                  CUT TO:
EXT. BACKYARD – A YOUNGER DANNY – FLASHBACK
The longer-haired youth pulls a plant out of a planter.
Beneath the dirt, in a plastic bag, is THE KILO OF COKE from
earlier. Danny looks at it for a moment and quickly throws
it in his backpack behind his books.
Danny walks back into the house, grabs his skateboard, and
exits the front door. He goes under the YELLOW POLICE TAPE
and past THREE UNIFORMED OFFICERS. Danny confidently nods
at them and they watch him skate away down the street.
EXT. CORNER – SETH’S TRUCK
Seth and Cam eagerly await Danny’s arrival. Young Danny
skates up and hands Cammeron the coke through the passenger
window.
                    CAMMERON
          I’ll get you the money soon.
Before Danny can answer, Seth quickly takes off in the other
direction.
                                                  CUT TO:
INT. BEDROOM – DANNY’S POV – PRESENT
Cammeron, coke hanging out of his nose, looks at Dan.
                    CAMMERON
          Want a little pick-me-up or what?
                    DANNY
          No thanks.
Cam wipes his moustache and the table. In the glass he sees
DEREK’S REFLECTION. Sure enough, Derek stands in the doorway
– a ghost of three years’ past.
                    CAMMERON
          Well—
                (smiling to Derek)
          I can tell by the look on his face
          that he wants one.
Danny turns.   Derek doesn’t lift his eyes from Cammeron.
                    DEREK
          You need to get your eyes examined.
                    CAMMERON
          I need to get my fucking nose
          examined.
Cam laughs and puts his cowboy hat back on.
                    DEREK
                (calmly to Danny)
          There’s a cute little redhead out
          there looking for you, Dan. Why
          don’t you go talk to her?
                    DANNY
          I’d like to kick it for a second.
                    CAMMERON
          Naw…get the fuck... Outta here, Dan.
                    DEREK
          Please.   Get out of here, please.
Danny looks at Cam, stands up, and walks out of the room.
Derek seizes his brother with his eyes as Danny exits.
                    CAMMERON
          Fuckin’ pigs are hasslin’ me any
          chance they get, man. Gotta be extra
          careful.
                    DEREK
          What’d you expect?     They have a job
          to do.
                    CAMMERON
          Fuck cops. They don’t understand a
          goddamn thing.
                (hiding the coke)
          Last chance before I put it away.
                    DEREK
          Give it a rest.
                    CAMMERON
                (smiling)
          Okay. Alright. Just don’t preach
          any self-righteous prison shit to me
          and I won’t ask.
                    DEREK
          Don’t worry about that.
                    CAMMERON
          Have a seat.
Derek sits. The sketchy Cammeron smiles, licks his lips,
and sits back down. He jitters his jaw as Derek stares him
down.
                    CAMMERON
          I haven’t had a chance to thank you,
          Derek. Since you haven’t fuckin’
          stopped by here.
                (after a beat)
          You kept your mouth shut and did
          your time and I... I respect that,
          man.
                    DEREK
          Did I have a choice?
Cammeron laughs.
                    CAMMERON
          No.
                (smiling at him)
          So what are you gonna do?    What are
          your plans?
                    DEREK
          I’m gonna get a job.
                    CAMMERON
          Professional basketball?
                    DEREK
          Uhhh... I don’t think so.
                    CAMMERON
          Courier boy?
Derek coldly shakes his head sideways in amazement. Cammeron
sniffs a little from his fingernail and takes a sip of beer.
                    CAMMERON
          Do the shit in the pen at all?
                    DEREK
          Nope.   Not once.
                    CAMMERON
          We thought you might be making a
          killing in there.
                    DEREK
          Who’s we?
                    CAMMERON
          Me and the fat kid.
                    DEREK
          Nope.   Kept my nose clean.
                    CAMMERON
          No pun intended.
Derek nods slightly, pulls out a pack of Marlboro’s and lights
up. Derek stares down at the laughing cokehead.
TIGHT ON CAMMERON. The sketchy dealer looks behind the couch
to break the stare.
                    DEREK
          Why would you think that I could
          make a killing in there, Cammeron?
          I only did it when my mom was short
          on cash.
Deep inside Cam knows. Behind the couch is a PISTOL and a
BONG. Nervous and hesitant, he grabs the bong.
                    CAMMERON
          Well... she sure was short a lot.
                                                  CUT TO:
EXT. SANDY BEACH – DANNY AND LIZZY
Her skirt is hiked high, her taut thighs reflecting the
moonlight. His pants collect at his ankles, anchoring each
pelvic thrust.
                    LIZZY
                (getting into it)
          Not yet, no. Think about something
          else. Think about baseball. Don’t
          stop. No. No.
                    DANNY
          Yes.    Yes.   Yes.
Danny releases inside of the redhead, yells in relief, and
looks at her. She firmly grabs his face.
                    DANNY
          What?     It’s still on.
                    LIZZY
          I wasn’t finished.
                    DANNY
          They’ll be other times.
He smiles and she kisses him.
                                                  CUT TO:
EXT. HOUSE – SETH
He stands around the keg with a group of skinheads and
lectures.
                    SETH
          Niggers aren’t the worst... they’re
          like... third, man. Jews are the
          worst... the gays right behind them.
Lizzy walks through the back gate and into the house. Danny
follows her and stops, focusing his attention on Seth.
                    SETH
          Gays and Jews should die... there’s
          no fucking question about that.
                    RANDOM SKIN
          We need another holocaust, man.
Seth turns and stares at the man.
                    SETH
          What do you mean "another?"   When
          was the first one?
The young man doesn’t know what to say.   Neither does anybody
else.
                    SETH
          Everybody else... the Coloreds, the
          Chinks, the Japs, The Mexicans...
          they should have their own separate
          continent. As far away from us as
          possible.
                (after a beat)
          On second thought... blow them all
          to fucking hell, man.
Everyone laughs except for Danny. Instead, he sparks up a
cigarette and analyzes the scary faces of the Disciples.

INT. CAMMERON’S BEDROOM – TIGHT ON CAMMERON
Derek looks at the man and takes a drag off his cigarette.
                    CAMMERON
          How was it in there with all those
          fuckin’ monkeys? You’re lucky they
          didn’t kill you.
He exhales and nods his head.
                    DEREK
          I agree.
                    CAMMERON
          Did any of them try and--?
                    DEREK
                (defiantly)
          What? Fuck me? No.
Cammeron smokes pot from a three foot BONG and clears the
carb. He holds the smoke in for a few seconds and exhales.
                    CAMMERON
                (changing the subject)
          Who runs the place?

          wetbacks?
                    DEREK
          The Mexicans.
                    CAMMERON
          It’s a fuckin’ vacation for them in
          there, huh?
                    DEREK
          Three squares a day.

          Fuckin’ peasants.
                    DEREK
          They were really... organized.
Cammeron puts the bong back behind the couch and collects
himself.
                    CAMMERON
          There’s something I have to tell
          you, Derek.
                    DEREK
          Is that right? I don’t think I wanna
          hear anything you have to say,
          Cammeron.
Cammeron smiles and thinks to himself.   Derek stares at him,
calculatingly.
                    CAMMERON
          I feel bad about it cause I value
          you as my friend.
                    DEREK
          You value me as your friend?
                    CAMMERON
          Always, man. You and Danny.    You’re
          like brothers to me.
Derek presses his tongue psychotically against his teeth and
stares at Cam.
                    DEREK
          He’s not your brother, Cammeron.
                    CAMMERON
          Fuck you, Derek. I’m the one whose
          been looking after him the last three—
Derek EXPLODES. With his feet, he pushes the GLASS COFFEE
TABLE hard into Cammeron’s knees. Cam screams in agony.
Derek SLUGS him in the face TWICE and Cam RETALIATES with
two of his own. They wrestle around the room and push their
way into the bathroom.
INT. TINY BATHROOM – DEREK AND CAM
Derek takes Cam by his long hair and SMASHES his face into
the mirror. IT SHATTERS. Derek follows with a solid puck
to the face.
                    DEREK
          Talk to him again and... I’ll kill
          you!
                    CAMMERON
                (bloody and beaten)
          Derek, man. What are you doing’?
                    DEREK
          Shut up!
                (teary eyed)
          Why, Cam? Why’d you set me up?!
          Because you think of me as a fucking
          brother?!
                    CAMMERON
                (slowly, mumbling)
          I’m gonna...
Derek bangs Cam’s face against the mirror once more.
                    DEREK
          Shut the fuck up! You’re not doing
          anything.
                (then)
          Do you understand what you put me
          through, you fucking cunt?! Do you!?
Derek slams Cammeron’s face into the mirror three more times.
Blood squirts on both of them and the entire bathroom.
                    DEREK
          Ssell me the shit to re-sell... hire
          a couple of scumbags to steal it
          back... use me as the fall guy.
          Double your profit. I got great
          friends, don’t I?!
Derek rinses Cam’s bloody face off by PLUNGING it into the
toilet. He pulls him back up, they turn and face the mirror.
                    DEREK
                (softly)
          And Seth was drivin’, right? Course
          he was. Anybody else would’ve hit
          me.
Derek stares at him in grave silence. CAMMERON RETALIATES
AGAIN. He forcefully backs Derek into the wall behind him.
He throws two punches at Derek – one in the stomach and one
to the face that opens his lip.
He misses on the third and Derek proceeds to kick the living
hell out of him.
BACK TO THE MIRROR. Cammeron is completely pummeled,   Derek
grinds his face into the glass.
                    DEREK
          See what shit looks like?
                    CAMMERON
          Your life…is over.
                    DEREK
          It already was with you in it.
Derek throws a bloody Cameron through the SHOWER CURTAIN and
he slams his head against the wall. He falls in the tub,
unconscious. Derek looks at him, grabs a small towel for
his lip, and exits.
EXT. SHED AREA – A GROUP OF 20 NAZI’S
They SALUTE the band and chant as they tune up for another
set. Derek pushes his way through and spills a few beers on
the way.
Cassandra smokes from a CRACK PIPE with a few random skins
as Derek passes by.
                    RANDOM SKIN
          Hey Derek!?
                    DEREK
          What?!
                    CASSANDRA
                (exhaling)
          Oh my god. What happened to you?
                    RANDOM SKIN
          Have you seen Cammeron?!
                    DEREK
          No I haven’t man.
                    STACEY (O.S.)
          Hey Daddy!
He turns and faces her.
                    DEREK
                (pointing his finger)
          Stay away.
                    STACEY
          Don’t you point your finger at me.
                    DEREK
          I’m serious, Stacey!   Stay away.
                    STACEY
          What are you gonna do?! Hit me?!
          Kick me as I roll on the ground?!
                    DEREK
          Yeah.
DEREK’S POV. He looks over to the kegs. Through the sliding
glass window, he sees Seth taking a tap hit off the keg.
All the guys in the b.g., INCLUDING DANNY, count and cheer.
                    STACEY (O.S.)
          I have a secret that I have to tell
          you.
                    DEREK
                (staring at Seth and Danny)
          No.
                    STACEY (O.S.)
          Read my lips then.
Derek looks back at Stacey. She says the three magical words
to Derek by moving her big, red luscious lips. "I LOVE YOU."
                    DEREK
          You’ve got terrible taste.
                    STACEY
                (examining him)
          Is that blood?
He sees the skins forming a group to approach him so he walks
the other way, ignoring her and them.
EXT. PATIO AREA – A CROWD
Seth continues his tap hit while all the other skins count
in the background. Derek walks out and watches Dan pump the
keg.
                    ET AL
          Forty-five!    Forty-six!    Forty-
          seven...!
Seth takes his mouth off the tap and belches like a pig.
All the guys laugh.
                    SETH
                (grabbing Danny)
          Why the fuck did you pump it?! I
          coulda gone for a minute at least!
Danny looks over and meets eyes with a bloody Derek.   He
FREEZES while everyone turns to look Derek over.
                    DEREK
          Take your hands off him, Seth.
Seth sees blood on Derek’s face and shirt and DRAWS HIS
PISTOL. He points it at Derek’s head from four feet away.
                    SETH
          Where’s Cammeron?
Derek stares directly into the BARREL of Seth’s pistol.
                    DANNY
                (frightened)
          Seth, man!? What are you doing?
                    STACEY
          Put it down, Seth!
                    SETH
          Don’t test me, Vinyard. Where the
          fuck did that blood come from?!
                    DEREK
          Go ahead and shoot me, Seth. It
          wouldn’t be the first time you fired
          shots at me.
Seth puts the gun directly to Derek’s cool head.
                    SETH
          What are you talking about?
                    DEREK
                (in front of everyone)
          You were driving, Seth. I know.     It
          was you and Cammeron.
Danny watches and listens in denial.    Seth nods and smiles.
                    SETH
          So what now then? A phone call to
          the cops? Tell them all about the
          blow and how Dan covered your sorry
          ass.
                    DEREK
                (turning back to Dan)
          Did you get all of that?
Seth glances over to a nodding DANNY. The second he takes
his eyes off of Derek, Derek grabs the pistol. A shot goes
off and people hit the deck. Derek wrestles the pistol away
and kicks Seth in the STOMACH.
Falling to the ground in pain, Derek cracks him in the face
with his fist TWICE and it’s over.
TIGHT ON DEREK. He turns with the pistol, takes the clip
out and walks over to Danny.
                    DEREK
          Take a good look around, man.
He makes his way over to Stacey, hands her the pistol, and
launches the clip over a fence.
The entire party watches Derek exit the party.
INT. BATHROOM – CASSANDRA
She walks in Cammeron’s small bathroom and looks at Cammeron,
bleeding and moaning in the tub. All wasted, she starts to
LAUGH.
                    CASSANDRA
          You got fuckin’ guests out there,
          Cam.
EXT. STREET – DEREK
He makes his way down the dark street.
EXT. PATIO AREA - DANNY’S POV
Stacey, the gun tucked in her buttocks, helps Seth inside
the house. Inside, Dan sees Cassandra pull glass out of
Cam’s forehead with a pair of tweezers. To the right, JASON
smokes CRACK from a pipe with two other skins. Danny walks
in the house, looks back at the pathetic crowd, and bolts
with his skateboard.
                                                  CUT TO:
EXT. STREET – TIGHT ON THE SKATEBOARD
It flies down the street. The board conquers the cracks in
the street at an incredible rate. It turns a tight corner,
cuts off a turning car, and suddenly STOPS ON A DIME.
Danny spots his brother walking twenty yards up on the left-
hand side of the street and slowly follows from across the
way.
EXT. VENICE BLVD. – A CROSSWALK
Derek steps across the SLEEPING HOMELESS as he walks down
the street by himself.
DANNY’S POV. Approaching Derek from THIRY YARDS away and
two animated black men. Derek reaches behind him and realizes
he’s without a gun.
Paranoid, Derek sticks his hand in his jacket and pretends
to be armed. The three men cross paths. The two laughing
black men are in SUITS with BRIEFCASES.
                    BLACK MAN
          What’s going’ on?
                    DEREK
          Not much.
Derek looks back at them as they pass and exhales. He spots
Danny from across the street, staring and skating from behind.
Derek stops, sits on a BUS STOP BENCH next to an old man,
and waits. Danny crosses the street and barely avoids a
collision with an oncoming Caddy.
                    DEREK
                (yelling)
          You’re gonna get nailed on that thing
          one of these days!
                    DANNY
                (approaching)
          I haven’t yet.
                    DEREK
          Your trucks are loose as shit.   I
          can see that from here.
Danny sits next to him on the bench and offers him a
CIGARETTE. The two have a smoke.
                    DANNY
                (exhaling)
          Why didn’t you tell me?
                    DEREK
          I thought you knew.
                    DANNY
          If I knew... I could’ve done
          something.
Cars and street hoods with CHANGE CANS randomly pass by.
                    DEREK
          Like what, Dan? Rat them out?    No.
                    DANNY
                (teary eyed)
          What is it, Der. Tell me…cause... I
          want to understand this shit.
Derek takes an extra long drag off his cigarette, thinks to
himself, and stares at his brother.
                    DEREK
          What is it? I fucking lost it Dan...
          the minute I killed those guys. And
          I couldn’t fight anymore because all
          of my energy... all of my fucking
          hate…everything man... had just...
                (looking for the words)
          I looked at them as animals, Dan. I
          did. But I learned a lot in there.
          I found out what it was all about.
          I thought about what they thought of
          me and I realized... I was the same
          animal.
                (after a beat)
          Shit happens to you when you hate.
          The worst shit imaginable.
The two rub heads and Dan puts his arm around his sullen
brother.
                    DEREK
          You with me on that?
Danny nods.
                    DEREK
          Good.
Danny squeezes tight and Derek kisses him on the top of the
head.
                    DEREK
                (softly recollecting)
          You reap what you sow, Dan.
                                                  CUT TO:
EXT. CAM’S HOUSE – LATE NIGHT
                    SETH
          He won’t be able to fuckin’ walk
          when I’m done with him.
                    CAMMERON
          Yeah, right.
                    SETH
          Fuck you, I’m serious.
                    CAMMERON
          What’ve you been smokin’, Seth?
          Derek would kick your ass so quick
          it wouldn’t be funny.
                (then, sincerely)
          we’re gonna have to kill him.
                                                  CUT TO:
APARTMENT BUILDING – THE COPS
Danny skates up to the front gate and looks at them.
                    COP #1
          How the hell...?
Derek slaps the roof on the passenger side and scares the
hell out of the officers.
                    COP #2
          Son of a bitch!
                    DEREK
          Pretty shitty assignment.
                    COP #2
          No shit.
                    COP #1
          Out of respect for your father,
          though.
                    DEREK
          Oh yeah?   What do you know about my
          father?
The two men sit there speechless as Derek walks over to an
awaiting Danny.
INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD – A SLEEPING DORIS
She snores on the couch. The clock on the wall reads eleven
as the boys ENTER. Davina awakens from her chair, delirious.
                    DAVINA
          Hello?
                    DEREK
          It’s okay, Davina.
INT. BEDROOM – DEREK AND DANNY
Danny turns on the computer while Derek gets undressed and
tends to his lip.
                    DORIS (O.S.)
                (half asleep)
          Goodnight boys.
                    TOGETHER
          Goodnight Mom.
                                                  CUT TO:
INT. BATHROOM – THE MIRROR - CONTINUED
Derek stares at himself as he takes out his CONTACT LENSES,
a million thoughts racing through his head. He looks at all
of his tattoos and SCARS. He twists to look at a huge scar
on his lower right back.
TIGHT ON HIS UPPER BODY. He stares at the SWASTIKA on his
tit. He puts his hand over the tattoo to see what he looks
like without it. He turns on the shower and gets inside.
INT. SHOWER – TIGHT ON DEREK
As he soaps himself down, the soap slips out of his hand and
sits on the bottom of the tub. He looks at it a long hard
time before he bends over to pick it up. He immerses his
face into the shower faucet and slowly begins to cry.
                                                  DISSOLVE TO:
INT. PRISON SHOWER – FLASHBACK
Derek lies on the tile floor, crying. The gigantic WHITE
ARYAN friend of STEVIE MCCORMICK and a gigantic BLACK INMATE
walk off with towels around their waist, satisfied. The
white trash Aryan whips his wet towel and it smack Derek.
                    WHITE ARYAN
          Thanks Peckerwood. That was nice.
The two exit and laugh.
INT. PRISON HOSPITAL – SAME – FLASH BACK CONT.
Derek sits on the bed on ALL FOURS as a middle-aged Latino
examines his rear end. The hospital ID shows his picture
and DR. EDUARDO AGUILAR printed below.
                    AGUILAR
          Well…you got some tearing down here.
          You’re gonna need a few stitches.
          Lay back down.
Dr. Aguilar clicks off his light and prepares to inject Derek
in the ass.
                    SWEENEY (O.S.)
          Well... I tried to save your ass.
TIGHT ON DR. SWEENEY. He softly chuckles from his chair and
manages to spark a smirk out of Derek. Derek closes his
eyes in pain as Aguilar puts the needle in his ass.
                    AGUILAR
          Hold still, Eric. Okay. I’ll be
          right back. Don’t go anywhere.
Aguilar looks at Derek and walks away.   Derek turns his head
slightly and meets Sweeney’s eyes.
                    SWEENEY
          I sure hope you learn from all of
          this bullshit.
                    DEREK
          What am I gonna learn in here, Doc?
          Hunh? What the fuck am I gonna learn?
                    SWENEY
          That you have the final say in who
          you are, man. What did you expect,
          Derek!?
The two look at each other and Derek puts his face into his
pillow. Sweeney stands up and walks over to the bed. He
sits right beside him and thinks to himself for a moment.
                    SWEENEY
          I got my Doctorate in Education...
          not medicine. But if you think babies
          come out of the womb evil... like I
          think you do... you’re bein’ a goddamn
          fool. No two ways about it. You’re
          missing the big picture, man.
                (after a beat)
          There’s nothin’ more beautiful, Derek.
          Nothin’ more pure... and nothin’
          more innocent... than a baby. Yet...
          you can’t see this.
                    DEREK
          They killed my father, Sweeney.
                    SWEENEY
          Hate killed your Dad... not that
          kid. You reap what you sow, Derek...
                    DEREK
          You gotta get me outta here, man.
                    SWEENEY
          Oh yeah?   Why should I help you?
                    DEREK
          Why the hell are you here?
                    SWEENEY
          I don’t know. You’ve got something.
          I can’t put my finger on it but—
                    DEREK
          They’re going to kill me, Sweeney.
Sweeney looks at the young man, heavily weighing his options.
                                                  BACK TO:
INT. HOUSE SHOWER – PRESENT – DEREK
Water crashes on top of his head as he composes himself.
Danny enters with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and
opens the shower curtain. He looks at his naked brother.
                    DANNY
          Did you tool any of my cancer sticks?
                    DEREK
          Yesterday I did.
                    DANNY
          Okay. I’ll let it slide this time.
          Do it again though…and I’ll do my
          Lawrence Powell imitation on your
          ass.
Danny laughs, shuts the curtain and takes a piss. Derek
pushes the curtain open, leans out, pushes Danny, and he
pisses all over himself.
                    DANNY
                (smiling)
          Fucking asshole!
Derek slides the curtain shut. Danny hears a SOFT KNOCK
offscreen so he zips up and flushes and exits.
                    DEREK
                (screaming from the water)
          Don’t flu—AAAHHH! You shit!
INT. HALLWAY – TIGHT ON DANNY
He looks through the PEEPHOLE. He sighs, drops his MACHETE
to his side, and opens the door.
INT. BATHROOM – THE SHOWER
TIGHT ON DEREK. Behind him, after a few seconds of water
therapy, the shower curtain opens again. A naked STACEY
comes in from behind and wraps her arms around him. He looks
over his shoulder and puts his head back under the faucet.
She kisses him, erotically.
                    STACEY
          I love you, Derek.    More than
          anything.
                    DEREK
          Who says I love you?
                    STACEY
          You do. Your eyes.     You will always
          love me, too.
Slowly, Derek turns to face Stacey – knowing deep down it’s
the truth. He analyzes her beautiful body. He grabs her
face with one hand and cups her breast with another. She
french kisses his ear and then his mouth.
                    STACEY
          I’ve missed you so much.    Oh God.
          You feel so good.
INT. BEDROOM – DANNY’S POV
He stares at the closed bathroom door where Derek and Stacey
make love. He sits at the computer and begins to type.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
                (on the screen)
          There was only one person Derek loved
          more than Stacey Sanders.
                                                  DISSOLVE TO:
INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD – MORNING – FLASHBACK
The place is immaculate. DENNIS VINYARD, the father of the
household, eats his breakfast in his LA COUNTY FIREFIGHTER
UNIFORM . Vintage fireman material: muscular, receding
hairline, zero facial hair. Handsome. A pretty and well-
dressed Doris scrambles eight eggs with mushroom and red
peppers.
                    DANNY (V.O.)
          That was Dad. Derek and Dad were
          best friends…which is something I’ve
          never heard of before. Fathers and
          sons are never best friends... but
          they were.
YOUNGER DANNY stares at his larger-than-life father. Dennis
takes his fire helmet off the table and sets it on the floor.
                    DORIS
                (towards the back)
          Breakfast!
                    DENNIS
          Let’s go, Davina! Derek!
                    DORIS
          So what’s this all about, Dennis?
Dennis doesn’t hear his wife because his attention is focused
on Danny.
YOUNGER DEREK, donning a flat-top haircut and no tattoos,
walks into the kitchen. The smiling athlete has his backpack
and blue SANTA MONICA CITY COLLEGE gym bag. He drops it
onto the ground and sits at the table. His father stares at
him.
                    DENNIS
          Good morning.
                    DEREK
          Good morning.
Doris sets food in front of her two sons and they both go to
work. Young Danny eats quietly.
                    DORIS
                (to her husband)
          Are you going to keep ignoring me?
                    DENNIS
          Jesus Doris... it’s not that big of
          a deal. All departments have to
          take a precaution class on gang patrol
          today.
                    DEREK
          What for?
                    DENNIS
          A guy was shot yesterday in Inglewood
          while changin’ a valve on a hydrant
          and LAPD is worried more firefighters
          will become targets. That’s what
          this bullshit is about.
                (sipping coffee)
          A good father this guy was though
          and now he’s in intensive care because
          of some goddamn... nigger. Compton
          Crips have pretty much declared war
          on LAPD and us.
                    DORIS
          Why you guys though? I can see LAPD
          but the fire department?
                    DENNIS
          They think we would rather let a
          building burn down over there than
          fight it.
                    DEREK
          They hit the nail on the head,
          basically.
                    DENNIS
                (smiling)
          Pretty much, yeah.
                (then, to Derek)
          Hey? Are you ready for tonight or
          what?
                    DANNY
          Hell yeah he is.
                    DEREK
          Let it all burn down I say Dad.
                    DENNIS
          Yeah. So…now we got two fights goin’
          on at one goddamn time. And of course
          you know whose fault that is?
                    DANNY
          Whose?
                    DENNIS
          Mayor Tom Bradley’s.
                    DANNY
                (excited)
          He spoke at our school.
                    DENNIS
                (smiling)
          I didn’t know you spoke "African",
          Dan?
Derek and Dennis laugh. Danny looks at them, confused.
Doris stared down Dennis.
                    DORIS
          Honey? Please don’t speak that way.
          They don’t—
                    DENNIS
          How am I speaking, honey?   I’m
          speakin’ fine.
Dennis takes a bite of his eggs and explodes.
                    DENNIS
                (to the bedroom)
          Davina! Get in here!   Now!
                    DAVINA (O.S.)
          I’m coming right now!
                    DENNIS
          I’ll tell you one thing. This
          "affirmative blaction" shit is driving
          me up the fuckin’ wall.
                    DENNIS
                (taking a bite)
          Firefighters getting’ 99’s on their
          tests while rappers who score a
          goddamn 62 walk away with the job.
                    DANNY
          Don’t we have to have "affirmative
          action?"
                    DENNIS
          Not when a job requires ability.
          No.
                    DORIS
          A lot of people would say otherwise.
                    DEREK
          Oh yeah? If Dad’s fightin’ a brush
          fire... surrounded by thousand degree
          flames... who would you want watchin’
          his back? A guy who scores a 99 or
          a guy who scores a sixty?
                (after a beat)
          You’d want the best man for the job.
                    DENNIS
                (smiling)
          You’re absolutely right, Derek.
YOUNGER DAVINA enters the dining room and takes a chair.
                    DAVINA
          Good morning.
Her lipstick glares off the dining lights.
                    DENNIS
          Good morning!
                (smiling)
          Look at you. You look like a star.
                    DEREK
          I like that color, Davina.
                    DAVINA
          Thanks.
                    DENNIS
          You did like it.
Dennis reaches over and wipes it off with his napkin.
                    DAVINA
                (whining)
          Come on, Dad. I’m a sophomore now.
                    DENNIS
          Yeah. Well you’re lucky I’m letting
          you wear that crap on your eyes.
                    DAVINA
          That sucks, man.
                    DENNIS
          It totally sucks. And we all
          sympathize with you, too.
Everyone laughs at their father – including DAVINA.
                    DENNIS
                ((shifting to Danny)
          You got practice today?
Danny shakes his head no
                    DANNY
          Coach’s sick.
                    DENNIS
          You wanna go to Der’s game with me
          then?
                    DANNY
                (excited)
          Yeah.
                    DENNIS
                (quickly to Derek)
          Long Beach CC tonight, right?
                    DEREK
          Yep.
                    DENNIS
          Okay.
                (to Danny)
          Ben’ll whip us up a couple of double
          deckers and we’ll head over.
                    DANNY
                (smiling)
          Killer.
DANNY’S POV. He looks at his happy father. Dennis reaches
over, puts his hand on Dan’s shoulder, and leaves it there.

INT. BEDROOM – DANNY – PRESENT
He stops typing and realizes just how much he misses his
father. Tears form in his eyes.
                                                  CUT TO:
EXT> BEN’S BURGER SHOP – LATE NIGHT
A white homeless man in an ARMY JACKET sits outside begging
for change. Seth and Cammeron, both beat-up, drunk and
bloody, stare at the man.
                    HOMELESS MAN
          Spare change for a cheeseburger?
                    SETH
          Get a job and buy one why don’t you.
                    HOMELESS MAN
          God bless you, brother.
                    SETH
          Fuck you.
Seth stumbles into the shop.   Cam stares at the homeless
man, psychotically.
                    HOMELESS MAN
          Fifty cents is all I ask.   I was in
          Vietnam, man.
                    CAMMERON
          Really? So you’ve had, what? Twenty
          fuckin’ years to get your shit
          together?
                    HOMELESS MAN
          All I want is something to eat,
          brother.
                    CAMMERON
          There are plenty of fuckin’
          dishwashing jobs out there, Vietnam...
          and you’re not my brother.
In the background, BEN THE OWNER and Seth shake hands.
                    HOMELESS MAN
          Who am I then if I’m not your brother?
                    CAMMERON
          You’re a disgrace to the white race
          is what you re. If Adolf Hitler was
          alive... God bless his soul... he
          would have you shot.
                    HOMELESS MAN
          Fuck you then. Now and forever.
          Fuck you.
Cammeron knees the weak man square in the face. The man
slopes down to his side, unconscious. As an afterthought,
Cammeron kicks him several more times.
                    CAMMERON
          Noooo.    Fuck you.
He walks inside the shop.    He sees Ben and smiles.
                    CAMMERON
          Hey Ben.    How are you?
                    BEN
          Fine.    What happened to you?
                    CAMMERON
                (smiling)
          I don’t look that bad, do I?
                    BEN
          You look like you got hit by a Mac
          Truck. You want somethin’ to eat?
                    CAMMERON
          Uhhh... I don’t have too big an
          appetite right now, Ben. I’m just
          gonna watch fat boy over here eat.

INT. BATHROOM -    TIGHT ON DEREK
He lies naked in the tub and stares at the ceiling. A naked
Stacey sits on the toilet, smokes a cigarette and stares at
her former boyfriend.
                    STACEY
                (softly)
          What are you thinking about?
                    DEREK
          What aren’t I thinking about?
                    STACEY
          Not that bullshit with Cammeron.    I
          told you it’s nothin’.
Derek shifts his eyes upwards to hers and stares her down.
She looks at him and takes a drag off her cigarette.
                    DEREK
          I was thinking about Dan’s two
          buddies. Chris and the other one.
                    STACEY
          What about them?
                    DEREK
          Their lives are fucked.
                    STACEY
                (smiling)
          Hey. Jason and Chris are cool.
          They fuckin’ worship you.
                    DEREK
          Worshipping me doesn’t mean they’re
          cool, Stacey. It means they’re
          fucked.
Stacey leans over and touches his shoulder.
                    STACEY
          Hey. Those two niggers deserved
          what they got, Derek. And just like
          Jason and Chris and a whole lotta us
          out there... I’ll believe that ‘til
          the day I die.
Derek looks at her, quickly sits up on the edge of the tub,
and flashes her his PECKERWOOD TATTOO.
                    DEREK
          You see that?
                    STACEY
          Yeah.
                    DEREK
          What does it say?
She stares at him, confused.
                    DEREK
                (distraught)
          Tell me what it says!
                    STACEY
          It says Peckerwood, Derek.
                    DEREK
          Do you know what that means?
                    STACEY
          No.     What does it mean?
Derek lays back down in the water and looks at her like she’s
from a different world.
                    DEREK
          It means "white boy."
She drops her cigarette in the toilet, grabs the hanging
towel, and drapes it over her.
                    STACEY
          So what’s the point?
                (softly, after a beat)
          What are you saying?
                    DEREK
          Everything’s different now, Stacey.
          And I can’t pretend I don’t see
          through it anymore.
Derek stares at her naked body and reminisces for a moment
before he shifts his eyes back at the ceiling.
                    STACEY
                (sensing it)
          So?
                    DEREK
          So goodbye, Stacey.
She stares at him, knowing it’s over.

INT. BURGER SHOP – TIGHT ON SETH
He eats a burger and chili fries at the same time. Cammeron
sits across from him, sparks up a cigarette and watches Seth
eat food nearly as gruesome as his face. He then takes a
look at the homeless man outside – who still lays motionless.
Cam feels his BANDAGED FACE.
                    CAMMERON
          I think I need to go to the hospital.
                    SETH
          Seriously?
                    CAMMERON
          I don’t know. I think so.
                    SETH
          Where’s Stacey?
                    CAMMERON
          Hanging out with Cassandra.
Seth continues to stiff his mouth. Cam looks outside again
and this time he sees a RED BMW slowly pull up. Cameron
slowly feels for his pistol and looks back at Seth.
                    SETH
          Derek’s a fuckin’ traitor pussy.
                    CAMMERON
          Well... we might be pussies too if
          we got treated the way he did.
                    SETH
          What do you mean?
                    CAMMERON
          Stevie McCormick called me... old
          school Venice bro.
                    SETH
          You’re kidding. Is he still--?
                    CAMMERON
          Fuck yeah.   He’s doin’ ten years.
                    SETH
          For what again?
                    CAMMERON
          Heroin. He said Derek was a blow up
          doll in there.
                    SETH
                (overwhelmed)
          What?
                (laughing in disbelief)
          Fucking A.
                    CAMMERON
                (amazed)
          He turned his back on those guys in
          there.
                    SETH
          Jesus.
Seth continues to eat as Cammeron becomes serious.
                    CAMMERON
                (towards the street)
          Oh Christ. You gotta be kidding me?
                    SETH
          What?
CAMMERON’S POV. A large and mature looking BLACK MAN with
the red BMW helps a BEAUTIFUL BLOND out of the car and THEY
KISS. Cammeron is at a loss for words. Cam puts out his
cigarette as the couple ENTER.
                    CAMMERON
                (looking at the two)
          Is there anything sacred in this
          country anymore? I mean... Jesus
          Christ.
                    SETH
                (more worried about food)
          What?
                    CAMMERON
          Stop feeding your face for a second
          and look behind you.
Seth turns his head and stares at the interracial couple.
With his back to them, Seth starts to sing a verse from the
famous Stevie Wonder song, EBONY AND IVORY. Cammeron starts
to laugh. The hard black man turns and looks at the two.
                    CAMMERON
          Can we help you with something? Do
          you have any questions about the
          menu?
                    BLAK MAN
          No questions.
                    CAMMERON
          I recommend either the "Big Ben
          Burger" or the "Chicken taco Special."
          Ben’ll put white meat or dark meat
          in your tacos if you ask him nicely.
                    BLACK MAN
          I only like white meat.
                    CAMMERON
          Obviously.
                    BLACK MAN
                (fed up)
          What’s your problem, pal?
                    CAMMERON
          First of all…I’m not your pal.
          Secondly... I don’t have problems.
          People who fuck me have problems.
                    WHITE GIRL
          Come on.     Let’s get out of here.
                    CAMMERON
          Hey! What a great idea! You got a
          clever little whatever it is there.
          I’d listen to it if I were you.
                    BLACK MAN
          You’re not me.
                    CAMMERON
                (smiling)
          And I thank God Almighty every day
          for that, believe me.
                    SETH
          Excuse me?   Tyrone?
                    BLACK MAN
          My name’s not fuckin’ Tyrone, man.
                    SETH
          Whatever. Why can’t you stick to
          your own race.
                    WHITE GIRL
                (disgusted)
          Jesus Christ! Where do you assholes
          come from?
                    CAMMERON
          What the fuck difference does it
          make where we come from, bitch? I’m
          from a place called America. A place
          that used to be a nice place to live
          before it became fuckin’ Africa-
          America.
                    BLACK MAN
          You ignorant... mother...fucker.
Seth quickly gets out of his chair and makes his gun totally
visible to the couple.
                    SETH
          You got a fuckin’ death wish, asshole?
          Do you? Make your move now if you
          do. If you don’t... get the fuck
          out of my sight. Cause I’m real
          close to shoving my piece up your
          girlfriend’s crotch... let me tell
          you.
The black man stares at the gun sticking out of Seth’s belly.
He grabs his girlfriend and quickly walks out of the joint.
Seth sits back down and continues with his food. Cammeron
looks over at Ben and raises his hands in the air.
                    CAMMERON
                (smiling)
          Everything’s hunky dory, Ben.   No
          problemo, okay?
                    BEN
          Better not be.
EXT. BURGER JOINT – THE RED BMW
The black man slams the passenger door and makes his way to
his side. He stops, produces a POCKET PHONE and snaps it
open. He hits one button and waits.
                    BLACK MAN
                ((into the receiver)
          Put Jerome on.
EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX – LATE NIGHT
A half-dressed Stacey sits in her piece of shit Ford Mercury
and sobs.
INT. BEDROOM – THE COMPUTER
Derek lifts a sleeping Danny off the keyboard. He helps him
into the bottom bunk, tucks him in, and watches him snooze.
                    DEREK
                (softly)
          Hey. Did you save it?
An asleep Danny nods. Derek slowly walks over to the computer
and reaches back to turn it off. Instead, he PEERS at the
screen, grabs his GLASSES and sits in the chair.
                                                  CUT TO:
INT. BURGER JOINT – SETH AND CAMMERON
Seth winds down on his feast.
                    CAMMERON
          Ready?
                    SETH
          Yeah.
They get up and walk towards the door – leaving a mess on
the table. Cammeron sparks up another cigarette.
                    CAMMERON
          It wouldn’t irritate me so much if
          the ratio was a little more even.
                    SETH
          What’s that?
                    CAMMERON
                (going mad)
          Ebony and Ivory back there! Almost
          all of those orange kid relationships
          are black men with white women and
          I’m fuckin’ sick of seein’ it!
                    CAMMERON
          I wouldn’t mind so much if it were
          more even.
                    SETH
          Huge dicks, Cam.    That’s all it is.
EXT. SHOP – LATE NIGHT
                    CAMMERON
          I used to think that too but... it’s
          gotta be more, man. It has to be
          more than the fact that they carry a
          big load. Chicks aren’t that shallow,
          are they? It’s politically correct...
          that’s what it is. White women...
          bein’ seen with the coloreds... it’s
          great for their image. Bitches today
          want to be known as bein’ fuckin’
          color blind.
                    SETH
          Oh yeah.   They get off on it.
                    CAMMERON
          And you can’t really blame Tyrone.
                    STH:
          Why the fuck not?
                    CAMMERON
          Well... how’d you like to drag around
          some fat, obnoxious Fly Girl? I
          wouldn’t.
                    SETH
          No shit.
                (imitating)
          Oh go girlfriend!    Don’t be puttin’
          up wid dat, girl!    Oh stop girl!
Seth and Cammeron laugh together.
INT. CAN – TIGHT ON LITTLE HENRY
He watches his brother Jerome and three others finish loading.
Henry sits in the driver’s seat as the four get out of the
WHITE VAN. Brandishing AK-47’s and pistols, Henry watches
them follow Seth and Cam through the van mirrors.
TIGHT ON THEIR FEET. The men close in. PANNING UPWARDS –
the one with a BLUE BANDANA on his head is JEROME.
                    SETH
          Are we goin’ to the hospital or what?
                    JEROME (O.S.)
          Funny you say that, Vinyard.
Seth and Cam freeze in their tracks. As they wheel with
their guns, the black men open fire. Shots virtually tear
apart their bodies and they fall to the pavement.
As Seth and Cammeron lie in pools of blood, the assassins
quickly walk over and examine their faces. Cammeron struggles
to stay alive.
                    THUG #1
                (quickly checking them out)
          What the fuck?! I thought you said
          he was here!
                    JEROME
          Homeboy said he was!
TIGHT ON CAMMERON.   He struggles to breathe.
                    THUG #2
          That’s what’s his name!
                    JEROME
          Cammeron Alexander.    Long time no
          see, nigger bitch.
A siren builds in the background.
                    THUG #1
          LETS’S GO!
Three of the men jet back to the WHITE VAN – Jerome staying
behind. He grabs CAMMERON and drags him over to the curb.
                    THUG #2
                (to Jerome)
          Come on, man!
Jerome places Cameron’s mouth on the corner of the curb.
                    CAMMERON
                (delirious, half-dead)
          Where we goin’?
                    JEROME
          How does Hell sound?
Jerome slams his foot to the back of Cam’s head. As sirens
approach from almost around the corner, he runs back to the
van and LITTLE HENRY takes off down the street. The two
bodies lay there – blood escaping them.
MOVING UPWARDS – we see their transfixed bodies composed
over the lights of Venice.
                                                  CUT TO:
INT. BATHROOM – BIRDS CHIRPING – EARLY MORNING
Danny stares at himself in the mirror as he rinses the
toothpaste from his mouth. He tries to shape the stubble on
top of his head.
INT. BEDROOM – CLEAN-SHAVEN DEREK
The whiskers are gone but still he has difficulty trying to
get the knot on his TIE correct.
                    DEREK
          Almost ready?
                    DANNY
          I’m printing it up and we’re out of
          here.
                    DEREK
          Okay.   Hurry up.
Derek walks out into the living room.
INT. MESSY LIVING ROOM – DORIS
She’s on the couch watching cartoons. She takes a jar of
Vick’s Vapor Rub and puts some on her chest. Derek walks in
the room on with a coat and tie. He bends over and kisses
her on the forehead.
Davina sits on the couch with a bowel of FROSTED FLAKES.
                    DEREK
          Good morning.
                    DORIS
                (shocked)
          Jeez. What happened to you?
                    DEREK
          I’m going to see my parole officer.
                    DAVINA
          Do you have Excel on disk?
                    DEREK
          I’ve got everything on disk.
                    DAVINA
          Can I use your computer?
                    DEREK
          Sure.
Davina smiles and takes her cereal bowl into the back bedroom.
Doris looks at Derek.
                    DORIS
          You look good.
Derek smiles and caresses his mother’s cheek.
                    DEREK
          We’re getting out of this dump, Mom.
                    DORIS
          All right. I’m all for it.
                (after a beat)
          Do you think I should color my hair?
                    DEREK
          Yes.
Derek smiles at his mother and thinks to himself.
                    DORIS
          What are you thinking about?
Derek gathers his thoughts and stares at her for a moment.
                    DEREK
          When I was in jail... all I thought
          about was how I was going to apologize
          to you. You, Davina, and Dan... but
          you mostly. You believed in me.
          You stood by my, even when it meant
          losing the house.
                (tearing up)
          Then I thought about Dad and—
                (wiping his eyes)
          You think you’ll ever be able to
          forgive me someday, Mother? Maybe?
A tear rolls down her face.
                    DORIS
          You’re my son.
DEREK smiles and hugs her tightly. She pulls back and brushes
the tears from his cheek. He smiles at his reaction.
                    DEREK
          Look at me.    I’m such a pussy.
                    DORIS
          No you’re not.
EXT. VENICE BLVD. – MORNING
Derek takes out some change and gets a copy of the LA TIMES
as Danny continues to skate ahead of him. Derek looks back
behind him, sensing danger. With no one in the distance, he
walks into a doughnut shop.
INT. DOUGHNUT SHOP – DEREK’S POV
He takes a guarded look outside. Everything seems normal.
A bus drives by. A group of Mexican laborers, dressed for
work and smiling, walk past in the other direction.
Inside, a black woman orders a dozen doughnuts from a short
Korean man behind the counter. Her young daughter grabs her
leg. Danny sits down and reads over his paper.
                    DEREK
          What do you want?
                    DANNY
          Chocolate bar and a... large milk.
Derek smiles at the little girl while he waits.     She wanders
from her mother’s leg and over towards Derek.
                    DEREK
                (to the girl)
          You look very pretty today.
She laughs and runs back to her mother. He looks outside
the window. Nothing. He looks back at the little girl.
                    DEREK
          How do I look?
                    BLACK GIRL
                (bashfully)
          Fine.
DANNY’S POV. He looks up from the paper.      He watches the
girl come over and check out his brother.     Derek laughs at
her spontaneity and drops to one knee.
                    DEREK
          What’s your name?
                    BLACK GIRL
          Tisha.
                    DEREK
          How old are you, Tisha?
She holds up four fingers.    Derek smiles.
                    BLACK MOTHER
                (staring at Derek)
          Come here, Tisha.
Tisha return to her mother and they exit. Derek watches the
girl as she continues to stare at him, wide eyed.
Outside, they hear SCREECHING TIRES and a BLUE FORD pulls up
in front. Rasmussen and Young Fuhrman get out.
INT. SHOP – DEREK AND DANNY
The two walk in and look at a curious and confused Derek.
                    DEREK
          What’s goin’ on?
                    RASMUSSEN
          We need to talk, Derek.
                    DEREK
          About what?
                    RASMUSSEN
          Seth Ryan and Cammeron Alexander are
          dead. They were shot to death outside
          Ben’s Burgers early this morning.
Derek takes both hands and pulls back his hair. He sits
down and thinks to himself for a few more seconds, frightened.
Familiar Cops #3 and #4, now on call, walk in and sit down.
SWEENEY FOLLOWS IN LAST AND DEREK STARES AT HIM.
                    DEREK
                (to Rasmussen)
          Any suspects?
                    RASMUSSEN
          Possibly. Big Cam’s jaw was shattered
          and nine of his teeth were knocked
          out on the curb.
                    SWEENEY
          Sound familiar?
Facing a vicious circle, Derek takes his frustration out on
a nearby chair. The owner barks at Derek in Korean. A
confused Derek eyes Sweeney, who walks over to him.
TIGHT ON SWEENEY AND DERED. Derek sparks up a cigarette and
stares over at Rusmussen, Danny, and the other officers.
                    SWEENEY
          Are they coming after you?
                    DEREK
          Fuckin’ A.
SWEENEY sighs to a concerned Derek.
                    SWEENEY
          I don’t think so. I think they feel
          justice has been served.
                    DEREK
          Maybe it has.
                    SWEENEY
          But we can’t let this thing escalate.
                (after a long beat)
          Will you talk to them?
Derek looks over and analyzes the innocence of his brother.
He then takes a long drag off his cigarette and nods.
                    DEREK
          I’ll do whatever it takes.
                    SWEENEY
          Okay.   Good.
Sweeney walks away and then turns back to Derek.
                    SWEENEY
          Watch your back.
Derek says nothing.    Sweeney exits with Rasmussen.
                    SWEENEY
                (back to Danny)
          You’re showing up today, right?
Danny looks at Sweeney and nods his head yes.
                                                  CUT TO:
EXT. VENICE HIGH – A BEAUTIFUL DAY
DEREK AND DANNY
Are outside the fence surrounding the field. There are boys
playing basketball on the far courts. Girls sitting in
circles on the grass. People eating lunch.
                    DEREK
          Hey. Keep your head up, alright?
          I’m going to take care of this
          bullshit and everything’s gonna be
          okay.
                    DANNY
          All right.
Derek stares at his brother as THE BELL RINGS.
                    DANNY
          I gotta bail.
                    DEREK
          Okay.   I’ll see you at home.
                    DANNY
          Okay.
Danny hops the fence with his backpack on. He looks back at
Derek. Cops #3 and #4 sit in their car in the background.
                    DEREK
          Hey.
                    DANNY
          Hey what?
                    DEREK
          Come here.
Derek puts his hand over the fence.    Danny walks up and clasps
it – FINGERS INTERTWINED.
                    DEREK
          I love you, Dan.
Danny smiles at his brother and nods, embarrassed. Danny
puts his ear phones on and heads to class. Derek watches
his brother through the chain linked fence. Danny meets up
with REDHEAD LIZZY and they soon diaper from Derek’s sight.
Derek turns and walks down the street, COP #3: You need a
lift anywhere?
                    DEREK
          Nope.
INT. MESSY HALLWAY – DANNY
Students rush past him off to class. Danny kisses Lizzy and
he hurries off to class. He pushes on a men’s room door.
INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM – SAME
Danny enters, sets his AMERICAN HISTORY X PAPER on the sink,
and takes an unearthly long piss at the urinal. He finishes
and turns. Standing there, GUN drawn is LITTLE HENRY.
                    DANNY
                (terrified)
          What are you doing, Henry?
                    HENRY
          Taking care of business.
Henry fires a shot into Danny’s chest.    Danny SLAMS into the
URINAL, gasping for air.
The force of the pistol knocks Henry to the ground. The two
stare at each other – EYE TO EYE. The PAPER falls to earth.
A teary-eyed Henry observes Danny’s death and together they
FREEZE on the tile floor.
                                                  CUT TO:
EXT. VENICE HIGH BATHROOM – YELLOW POLICE TAPE
Officers and detectives monitor the area. Young students,
including Lizzy and her friends, weep at the horror.
Rasmussen brings THE PAPER over to Sweeney. Sweeney looks
over the bloodstained report and peers up.
SWEENEY’S POV.   He spots a grieving Davina and Doris.
                    RASMUSSEN
          He won’t let go. Will you talk to
          him.
INT. BATHROOM – TIGHT ON DEREK AND DANNY
A tearful Derek cradles his bloody brother.     Sweeney walks
over, crouches, and talks to Derek’s back.
                    SWEENEY
          Derek?   You gotta let him go, man.
                    DEREK
          I can’t.
Derek begins to cry outright. He can’t control himself.      He
lets go of Danny’s corpse and charges out into the hall.
INT. HALLWAY – DORIS AND DAVINA
Derek embraces them. Doris grabs his face – torn between
love and hate. A guilt ridden Derek tears from them and
walks away with Sweeney soon in tow.
THE END
