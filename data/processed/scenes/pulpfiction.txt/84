<L>__{exterior apartment courtyard day}
<A>__{butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the courtyard... ...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street... ...goes through the alley... ...and into his car in one steadicam shot.}
<L>__{exterior honda day}
<A>__{butch cranks the car into gear and drives away. the big wide smile of a survivor breaks across his face.}
<L>__{exterior apartment building street day}
<A>__{the honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment building.}
<L>__{interior honda day}
<A>__{butch looks out the window at his former home.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{that's how you're gonna beat 'em, butch. they keep underestimatin' ya.}
<A>__{this makes the boxer laugh out loud. as he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player. when the music starts, he sings along with it. he drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the corner across from teriyaki donut. butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see:}
<B>__{through the windshield}
<A>__{the big man himself, marsellus wallace, exit teriyaki donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee. he steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of butch's car. this is the first time we see marsellus clearly. laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him. when marsellus is in front of butch's car, he casually glances to his left, sees butch, continues walking... then stops! double take: "am i really seeing what i'm seeing?" butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. he stomps on the gas pedal. the little honda slams into marsellus, sending him, the donuts and the coffee hitting the pavement at thirty miles an hour. butch cuts into cross traffic and is broad sided by a gold camaro z 28, breaking all the windows in the honda and sending it up on the sidewalk. butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was fabienne's honda. blood flows from his nostrils. the still functional tape player continues to play. a pedestrian pokes his head inside.}
<C>__{pedestrian}
<D>__{jesus, are you okay?}
<A>__{butch look at him, spaced out.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{i guess.}
<A>__{marsellus wallace lies sprawled out in the street. gawkers gather around the body.}
<D>__{gawker #1}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{he's dead! he's dead!}
<A>__{this jerk's yelling makes marsellus come to. two pedestrians help the shaken butch out of the wreckage. the woozy marsellus gets to his feet.}
<D>__{gawker #2 if you need a witness in court, i will be glad to help. he was a drunken maniac. he hit you and crashed into that car.}
<C>__{marsellus}
<P>__{(still incoherent)}
<D>__{who? gawker #2}
<P>__{(pointing at butch)}
<D>__{him.}
<A>__{marsellus follows the gawker's finger and sees butch coolidge down the street, looking a shambles.}
<C>__{marsellus}
<D>__{well, i will be damned.}
<A>__{the big man takes out a .45 automatic and the gawkers back away. marsellus starts moving toward butch. butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee line toward him.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{sacre bleu.}
<A>__{marsellus brings up his weapon and fires, but he's so hurt, shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild. he hits a looky loo woman in the hip. she falls to the ground, screaming.}
<D>__{looky loo woman oh my god, i've been shot!}
<A>__{that's all butch needs to see. he's outta here. marsellus runs after him. the crowd looks agape. butch is in a mad, limping run. the big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run. butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign that reads "mason dixie pawnshop".}
