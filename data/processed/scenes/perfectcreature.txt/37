<A>__{lilly is in a police van. jones and dominic are there with her; both of them trying to come to grips with the strange stun weapons they've been given. and there are three huge, dark eyed soldiers there, dressed in the ominous black uniform of the queen's imperial guard, cocking their electric batons; which fizz in the half light.}

<D>__{anything?}
<A>__{we cut between lilly in the van and silus on the roof.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{no.}
