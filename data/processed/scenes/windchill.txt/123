<L>__{exterior ravine continuous}
<A>__{she starts down the steep snowy embankment after the snowplow driver, who is now far enough below to be out of sight.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(calling down)}
<D>__{wait! don't go down there! stop!}
<A>__{suddenly the snowy leaves gives way under her and she slips. lands hard and slides the rest of the way down on her ass.}
<L>__{exterior bottom of ravine continuous}
<A>__{she comes to a stop thirty feet below at the bottom of the ravine beside the surprised snowplow driver. and the highway patrol car. it's resting on its roof in the snow at the bottom of the ravine, wheels in the air. it looks like an overturned beetle. something moves in its front seat. the snowplow driver calls to the trapped highway patrolman.}
<C>__{snowplow driver}
<D>__{hang on, officer! we'll get you out!}
<A>__{she catches his arm to stop him.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{no!!! don't go near it!!!}
<C>__{snowplow driver}
<D>__{what!!? we have to get him out of there...}
<A>__{smoke rises from the car's gas tank, a small fire burning.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{doesn't matter! he's already dead!}
<C>__{snowplow driver}
<D>__{what the hell are you talking about?}
<A>__{inside the overturned car the trapped highway patrolman struggles. his hat has fallen off and floats in the icy water flooding the car, threatening to short the radio. which is playing the same song as christmas eve fifty seven years earlier. "rockin' around the christmas tree." despite being pinned upside down and in pain from injuries sustained in the accident, he chuckles at his predicament. we realize he's been drinking. as he struggles to free himself the cop looks in the direction of the snowplow driver and our girl.}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{should've known you vultures would turn up...}
<C>__{snowplow driver}
<D>__{try not to move, officer, you might have a neck injury.}
<A>__{but the cop continues to struggle, pain sobering him.}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{what are you waiting for, a letter from the bishop?}
<A>__{suddenly it dawns on our girl that he isn't talking to them. also that they aren't alone. widen to reveal a dozen elderly priests in black winter coats and fedoras are standing all around them on the snowy embankment, faces grim. the residents of st. christopher's home for retired clergy. suddenly there's a whoosh as the engine fire spreads across the car's undercarriage, moving toward the fuel tank. the priests exchange a look, reaching some silent decision. the leader of the elderly priests comes forward.}
<C>__{highway patrolman }
<D>__{hurry it up, i smell gas...}
<A>__{the snowplow driver stands there, confused by what he's witnessing. the old priest crouches down, reaches through the open window past the trapped highway patrolman. rips out the chattering two way radio by its cord. the cop's face registers disbelief, then fury, as he realizes the priests aren't going to help him. are in fact condemning him for years of crimes committed on this stretch of road.}
<C>__{highway patrolman }
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{oh no you don't! you bastards have no right to sit in judgement of me. i know what you're thinking but i had nothing to do with that drunk girl's disappearance. i saw her home safely. just ask the county investigators. and anything else you think you saw? all of it was lawfully done!}
<A>__{he sputters as gasoline drips on his face from above. another whoosh, blue flames spreading out from the fuel line. the cop smells smoke, a pleading note entering his voice now.}
<C>__{highway patrolman }
<D>__{please, father... for the love of christ have mercy on a poor sinner!}
<A>__{there's a small explosion, and the inside of the car starts filling with flames and black smoke. the trapped highway patrolman begins burning alive, cursing.}
<C>__{highway patrolman }
<D>__{goddamn you filthy bastards! you think you'll be rid of me!? you'll never be rid of me!! i will be your worst nightmare!! i will be }
<A>__{the rest is lost in a second larger explosion. flames flicker on the elderly faces of the priests gathered here to bear mute witness. they watch the burning patrol car for a moment longer, then one by one climb the embankment.}
