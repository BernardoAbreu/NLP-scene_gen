<A>__{she closes the door behind her so's not to trigger the light switch. finds her legs are giddy. holds onto the door frame for a moment to steady herself. it looks like she's crashed at the very end of the housing development where it cuts like a knife edge into an old forest. the dirt road stretches ahead beyond the barrier, into the midst of the forest. behind her, shrouded in darkness, houses in different stages of development dot the deforested landscape. land moving trucks sit on recently flattened land, waiting to tear into the next layer of forest. patches of leftover snow and puddles of rain catch the light from the moon which hides in an overcast sky. jesus! she's driven all the way from the mall only to find herself in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of psychopaths on her tail. this must be some sick joke. speaking of which, where are these little bastards? her eyes scan the darkness for a sign. nothing. that doesn't mean they're not close by. she checks out the damage to the car by feel. the driver's side is scratched and dented. the front is wedged into the tree. the only way out is for her to back up the car. she climbs back in for another try.}
