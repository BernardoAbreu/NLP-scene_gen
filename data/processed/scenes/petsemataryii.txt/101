<L>__{interior chase's van moving}
<A>__{a map of maine is unfolded on the passenger seat. chase is on the car phone.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{can i have the address for quentin yolander?}
<A>__{chase jots an address down on the map. he turns the van up a mountain road, winding through the towering pines.}
<L>__{exterior yolander's cabin day}
<A>__{a remote, rustic dwelling nestled into the desolate backwoods.}
<L>__{interior yolander's cabin day}
<A>__{quentin yolander rocks back in his thick hide chair. his world is closed off from daylight by the extensive blinds. he's holding a small poodle in his lap. its big brown eyes are staring back at him.}
<C>__{yolander}
<D>__{you'd be so much more interesting with blue eyes...}
<A>__{and now, one of the poodle's eyes pops out. yolander's finger comes through from beneath the eye socket. on closer examination, we realize that the dog is not alive at all. yolander has his hand inside the hollowed out carcass. he carefully looks over a container of glass eyes on his desk and selects the right shade of blue. a shot of whiskey rests nearby. yolander reaches up into the poodle's belly and fits the blue eyes securely into place. there's a knock at the door. yolander ignores it. maybe he's deaf. another knock. yolander turns towards the door, annoyed at the intrusion. and behind that annoyance, there's a touch of madness. pulling back, we see the rest of the room. stuffed animals are crowded from floor to ceiling. a product of yolander's obsession with taxidermy.}
<C>__{yolander}
<D>__{i'm immortalizing a poodle. state your business!}
<A>__{yolander presses some stuffing into the poodle's gut and begins to sew up the stomach.}
<C>__{chase }
<D>__{doctor yolander. this is chase matthews. i've moved into your offices in ludlow...}
<A>__{yolander's attention remains on the needle as he meticulously stitches the belly.}
<C>__{chase }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...i sent a blood sample out for analysis. they tell me i sent them the blood of a dead animal...}
<A>__{at this, yolander breaks his concentration. the needle pricks his hand. blood oozes from the puncture, dripping onto the dog's stomach.}
<C>__{chase }
<D>__{...a dog...}
<A>__{yolander rises from his seat and swings open the door. chase stands in the doorway, startled. it doesn't take a genius to figure out that the good doctor is drunk.}
<C>__{yolander}
<P>__{(glaring)}
<D>__{why are you bothering me about this? can't you leave it be?}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{i... um...}
<A>__{chase glances to the right and steps back...}
<B>__{a bobcat}
<A>__{is perched nearby, frozen in mid pounce. it takes a second for chase to register that the bobcat has been stuffed. now chase sees the rest of the room... a whole zoo of stuffed animals, looking like a rural version of the bates motel.}
<C>__{chase}
<P>__{(momentarily thrown)}
<D>__{...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...}
<C>__{yolander}
<D>__{the creed cat, that's right. bastard's name was "church".}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{let me guess. your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{exactly! i thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...}
<A>__{quentin yolander laughs. it's disconcerting.}
<C>__{yolander}
<D>__{there's no "blood condition." the dog isn't sick, it's dead.}
<P>__{(drawing closer)}
<D>__{and so was creed's cat. and so was his wife the night she was killed for the second time...}
<A>__{as yolander moves forward, chase backs up. he bumps into a whole shelf of stuffed creatures. to his right, a raven sits frozen on its perch. chase regards yolander as being completely insane.}
<C>__{yolander}
<P>__{(menacing)}
<D>__{you want some advice, friend? you get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{well... uh... thanks...}
<A>__{chase continues to back out of the door. on his way out, he bumps into the stuffed raven's perch... ...only this raven isn't stuffed. it spreads its wings and}
<B>__{screeches.}
<A>__{chase just about jumps out of his skin, tripping out of the doorway.}
