<A>__{here she comes along the roses, still drinking, still fuming. a figure comes up behind her. falls in step.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{lovely party, huh?}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{depends on your point of view. i've been listening to some idiot brag about his girlfriend.}
<A>__{still walking. she never looks at him.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, in that case, for your information, it is a lovely party indeed. anything on your mind?}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{it's not so much that my husband is having an affair with his meal ticket. it's just a pity we can't have one honest conversation about it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what's wrong with this one? a promising start, i'd say, in the honesty department.}
<A>__{she finishes her drink. throws the glass away. from our angle we can now see amelia in the window, watching them.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{if this is what you call an honest talk, i'd say you need some practice.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{great. let's try one about you and fred upton.}
<A>__{she stops walking. turns in shock, to see his easy smile.}
<P>__{george (contâ€™d)}
<D>__{well, i'm waiting for our practice conversation. hoping i will learn something. about honesty.}
<A>__{she glares at him, and storms off. he lets her go. hear a car engine turn over. dorothy peeling out. george reflects. as he walks back toward the party, he now sees amelia in the window. he stops. their look holds.}
