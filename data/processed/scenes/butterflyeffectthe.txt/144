<D>__{i want to make a deal.}
<A>__{the aryans laugh, make discrete eye contact with karl, who grins and signals to let evan pass.}
<L>__{interior karl's cell continuous}
<A>__{karl and rick wait expectantly as evan nervously enters. they say nothing, relishing the fearful silence.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{look. i'm new to all this but i think i get how things work. you gotta join a gang or else end up dead meat.}
<A>__{they continue to stare.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{well it sure ain't gonna fucking be with no niggers or spics. so how do we do this? you gotta work your way up, and i'm the new guy.}
<P>__{(looking ill)}
<D>__{so... should i... i mean, do i suck your dicks right now?}
<A>__{karl and rick exchange looks.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{is your blood pure?}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{i ain't no fucking kike if that's what you mean.}
<A>__{rick stands. all muscle.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{let's see what you got. and watch the fucking teeth or you'll be leaving without 'em.}
<A>__{evan nods reluctantly and peacefully drops to his knees. karl and rick lower their pants to their ankles. evan looks miserable, about to do the deed when carlos bulldozes past the aryans into the room, slamming karl into the wall and jamming a shank into karl's crotch! rick instantly charges carlos, but trips on the pants around his ankles. evan, anticipating rick's fall, stomps rick's face before snatching his journals from karl's shelf. evan frantically flips through them, hunting for something, as the other white supremacists charge the cell.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{carlos!}
<A>__{carlos drops karl's writhing body to the floor and presses his girth against the cell door. evan locates an entry and concentrates on the words just as the other supremacists force the door open evan focuses on the words. chanting quickly.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{we took the woods behind the junkyard just to make sure we wouldn't bump into tommy. we hadn't seen the smoke yet.}
<A>__{words from the entry begin to shimmer. reverberant sounds of barking break the sound barrier and the image of aryans storming the cell behind him become a frenetic blur}
