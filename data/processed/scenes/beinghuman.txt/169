<L>__{exterior beach day}
<A>__{hector turns from his work. out at sea the kids look small and vulnerable. hector is more anxious than he should be, out of practice at fatherhood. he calls to them.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{come on in, kids... that boat doesn't look too safe...}
<A>__{they call back to him.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{we're fine!}
<A>__{hector tries to relax, but he doesn't have the confidence yet, or something. he is edgy.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i've just found you... i don't want to lose you. what would i tell your mother... come on in...}
<A>__{he walks down to the water. the kids reluctantly pull on the oars and bring the little boat in. a few feet from the beach they hit some sand. the boat sticks. hector wades out in his shoes so far. then he calls to thomas.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{throw me the rope, thomas, i will pull you in.}
<A>__{thomas throws the mooring rope to hector. it isn't attached to the boat. hector ends up with all of the rope in his hands. he stands there, and they all laugh.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{this is one useless piece of rope, thomas...}
<A>__{just for a moment we have the image of our hector standing on the shoreline with a length of rope. an image with an echo from six thousand years ago. but this time hector is laughing, and his kids are safe.}
