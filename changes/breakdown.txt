<ACTION>__{On the backslope of a mound of rubble, a three-man TV crew (field producer, reporter, and cameraman, all wearing flak jackets) waits while the cameraman, JEFFREY TAYLOR, works to repair his malfunctioning minicam. Throughout this sequence, ROD, the reporter, types on a laptop computer, oblivious to what is happening around him. HOWARD, the field producer, lies on his stomach, peering cautiously over the crest of the rubble through binoculars. Beyond him we see an empty street. It is lined with buildings blasted by shells: a sawtooth wall in the f.g., a ruined high-rise at the end of the street, billboards in an unrecognizable foreign language.}

He wears a sweat- stained Western hat, cowboy boots and a T-shirt with the sleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps. He saunters over to the Cherokee, stands there a beat, looking over Jeff's shoulder. Jeff senses something behind him, turns.
