<A>__{steve christy comes upon alice, who is renailing floorboards on the porch of the arts & crafts cabin. on the railing is a sketch pad which steve thumbs through. insert: alice's sketch. it is a moody pierce, a sense of foreboding dominates it. otherwise, it is the camp's central compound, featuring the tree that forms the central focus.}
