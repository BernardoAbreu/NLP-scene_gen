<A>__{close up of a gold framed miniature portrait of john merrick's mother (tune or melody over her picture, heartbeat), which dissolves to close up of real mother smiling a shadow comes over her face. close up of elephant ears, trunks, faces moving. dark, heavy feet stomping elephant trumpet, rearing up. powerful hit and the mother falls. darker. trunk slides over mother's face and breasts and stomach, leaving a moist trail. mothers pov of elephant's mouth, eyes, skin. mother's face twists and freezes in a blurred snap roll. black again. knock, knock sound. curtain opens to horrified faces.}

<T>__{fade in to :}
<A>__{steam shooting out of a huge old half rusted calliope. the music is very loud and raucous. moving up and back we see the black awning entrance to the freak tent, where frederick treves, resident surgeon and lecturer on anatomy at the london hospital, is standing with his back to us observing the posters of the freaks. coming along a muddy walkway at the side of the tent is treves' wife, anne, and their two daughters. the shrill over whelming music seems to engulf her. she looks discomfited, vulnerable, and protective of her daughters. the girls, oblivious to any fear, are finishing their chocolate sweets. close up of treves looking at a poster. he hears:}
<D>__{#1 daughter poppa!}
<A>__{treves turns and looks down to a chocolate covered face. he smiles at the children and anne. anne sees the dirty faces and begins cleaning one of them. the other daughter looks into the freak tent.}
<D>__{#2 daughter poppa... may we go in there?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{alright... your turn.}
<A>__{she turns the girl away from the freak tent and begins cleaning her face. her kerchief pulls and distorts the little daughter's face. suddenly the girl sees a ring of elephants in the distance.}
<D>__{#2 daughter oh,look m ummy! elephants!}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{oh, elephants! we'll go see them.}
<A>__{she stands.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(to treves)}
<D>__{you won't be long?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i will join you shortly.}
<A>__{she takes the children off toward the elephants. treves watches them go for a moment, then turns and we go with him into the dark freak tent. he pauses to pay admission at a small booth, then disappears within. darkness. we hear what could be the trumpeting of an elephant. treves parts the black canvas and enters the main part of the tent. off to his left he sees a man wrapped in a black cape, holding a conch shell aloft and blowing powerfully into it. the tent is dimly lit with flickering oil lamps. people mill about through the weaving corridors. to treves' right, he sees a sign reading, "the deadly fruit of the original sin," over a small, very dark corridor. treves enters the passage and disappears into the shadows. the corridor has a series of flaps and turns to disorient the spectator. treves carefully pushes his way through and arrives at the inner chamber. in a roped off space stands a small stage set at eve level, with curtains on three sides. on the stage is a bell jar filled with grey murky fluid lit from behind with casts an eerie glow in the chamber. suspended in the fluid is the life sized body of a baby doll with the attached head of a large snake. at the join of head and body is a blob of unidentifiable organic matter. it is obviously phony, but the effect is still very disquieting. at the bottom of the jar, in the muck, sits an apple with two large bites out of it. behind the jar is a painting on the order of a religious triptych, portraying adam on one side, eve on the other, and the tree flowering over the jar. treves' impassive face is bathed in the watery glow. he studies the strange object with a critical eye. in the passage we hear movement, and an older gentleman enters. he seems visibly impressed with "the deadly fruit of the original sin."}
<C>__{older man}
<D>__{a wicked birth...}
<A>__{after a moment, treves quietly leaves the inner chamber. as he pushes his way through the corridor, the noise grows and becomes a cacophony of strange sounds. he exits and hears a booming roar and the rush of air as a series of twelve candles, mounted in a row on a ten foot stand, are blown out by "the incredible wind man." his barker steps up and talks to the people.}
<C>__{barker}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, his lungs are larger than this mammoth blacksmith's bellows. so great is his power of exhalation, rivaling even that of the great north wind, that he will now challenge two grown men to attempt to hold the bellows shut as he applies the mighty blast of his herculean breath! are there any volunteers?}
<A>__{a few people raise their hands. the barker scans the crowd and then points over the heads of the volunteers to two men toward the back.}
<C>__{barker}
<D>__{ah! i see two likely lads! come forward! come forward! pit your strength against the mighty wind man!}
<A>__{during the above, the incredible wind man removes his cape, revealing his great barrel chest and pot belly supported by spindly, white, hairless legs. as the barker sets the "volunteers," the wind man walks about the small platform, huffing and puffing and blowing on the conch shell. the "volunteers" set, the wind man steps up to the end of the bellows, takes an enormous breath, and twirls his black handlebar moustache as a signal to the barker.}
<C>__{barker}
<D>__{gentlemen... are you ready?}
<C>__{the lads}
<D>__{yes we are... right... etc.}
<C>__{barker}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen!... let the demonstration begin!!}
<A>__{the wind man clamps his mouth to the bellows, and with great show begins to exhale, savagely stamping his feet. the two lads struggle obviously, and then pretend to be forced apart. the barker triumphantly lifts the wind man's hand. the wind man ceases to blow, removes his lips from the bellows and the two lads instantly collapse together on the floor.}
<C>__{barker}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen!... "the incredible wind man!!!}
<A>__{the crowd cheers, while the wind man puts the conch shell to his lips and proudly stamps his feet, circling about the two lads. amidst this applause, treves smiles indulgently. he moves on, looking for something genuine. two bobbies move through the crowd, intent upon a certain destination. treves conveys a casual interest in them. treves moves on to a bearded lady who combs her beard, busily chewing tobacco and spitting into a spittoon. treves continues to work his way through the crowd. up ahead he sees the bobbies.}
<C>__{bobbies}
<D>__{make way! make way!}
<A>__{they round a corner.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{oh yes they are, they're yours alright.}
<A>__{we hear the laughter of a crowd. treves moves closer to see a fat lady seated in a chair on the next platform. on each knee she holds a dwarf. they are dressed as babies. a skeleton man stands beside her.}
<C>__{skeleton man}
<D>__{i refuse to believe it! i will not accept it! those babies are simply too ugly, they cannot be mine!}
<A>__{the crowd laughs uproariously.}
<C>__{skeleton man}
<D>__{i don't want them! get rid of them! i don't want to see them!}
<C>__{fat lady}
<D>__{darling, don't be difficult! let's take our sweet lovely children on an outing.}
<C>__{skeleton man}
<D>__{we'll take these miserable whelps on an outing, alright! we'll take them to the zoo... where they will stay!}
<A>__{from the direction the bobbies have gone, we hear several screams.}
<C>__{fat lady}
<P>__{(pausing at the screams)}
<D>__{children save yourselves! prevail upon your pappa!}
<A>__{the two dwarves get down from her knees and approach the skeleton man. they kneel and tug at his thin legs.}
<C>__{dwarves}
<D>__{poppa! poppa! poppa, please!}
<A>__{at this point, a father holding his young son in his arms passes by treves. the young boy clutches his father's neck in fear, hiding his face.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(out loud, to no one in particular)}
<D>__{this is too much! they should not allow it! they should not allow it!}
<A>__{treves, very curious now, along with several others, make their way around the corner. before him, treves sees an agitated crowd staring at something that from his point of view he cannot see. brushing past him is a woman pulling a small, confused and frightened little girl. getting closer to the commotion, he sees four bobbies standing with a well dressed alderman, arguing with the owner of this particular exhibit. a distraught, almost hysterical woman is ineffectually striking the owner with her fists about his head and shoulders, crying weakly and incoherently.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{beast, beast...}
<A>__{treves is just about to see whatever it is that is causing the alarm, when one of the bobbies says:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no! that's right out! drop the curtain!}
<A>__{as the curtain drops, treves just glimpses baggy trouser cuffs and two horribly deformed, root like feet. the distraught woman has been pulled away from the owner and is sobbing on a bobby's shoulder.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{you can't do that! i've got my rights!}
<C>__{alderman}
<D>__{i have the authority to close you down, and i'm doing just that!}
<A>__{in the crowd, treves notices a young boy staring open mouthed, blankly at the curtain. treves pushes through the glut of people to join the boy and get a better view. the curtain is actually a large canvas. on it is a life sized portrait, crudely painted, of a creature that could only be possible in a nightmare. it is the figure of a man turning into an elephant. the transformation, however, is not complete; there is still more of the man than beast. palm trees in the background suggest the jungle habitat in which this perverted object might have once roamed. filled with curiosity, treves moves toward the curtain.}
<C>__{alderman}
<D>__{this exhibit degrades all who see it, as well as the poor creature himself.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{he's a freak! how else can he live?}
<C>__{alderman}
<D>__{freaks are one thing. no one objects to freaks, but this is entirely different. this is monstrous, and ought not to be allowed. these officers will see to it that you are on your way as soon as possible. good day.}
<A>__{the alderman turns and leaves the tent.}
<C>__{owner}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{...movin' again!}
<A>__{he shakes his head in disgust. now at the canvas, treves tries to lift the edge to get a peek inside the wagon, but the meaty hand of the owner clamps down on his wrist.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{have a care, guv'nor.}
<A>__{the two men look at each other for a solid moment.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{forgive me...}
<A>__{treves backs away and returns his gaze to the painted canvas.}
<T>__{fade to black:}
<A>__{operating room the london hospital we see a bellows pumping air into the open grate of a cast iron stove. we hear moaning in the background. the coals flare to a fierce glow. from the mouth of the stove protrude the handles of several cauterizing irons, their heads imbedded in the coals. up above the irons, treves stands by a waist high operating table covered with black leather. his face is illuminated by an oil lantern held by a nurse. the room is fairly dark owing to the oppressive overcast sky seen through two windows. there is also a large sink, a cupboard containing dressings, gags, manacles, emetics and other unattractive things, and two hard chairs. two students and two other doctors, mr. fox and mr. hill, are present. the two students are pulling with constant pressure on a rope tied to the patient's leg. treves and mr. fox are working on a chest wound caused by a machine accident. there are gear wheel marks getting progressively deeper as they near a great open gash. mr. hill places a cotton mask over the patient's nose and mouth and applies drops of chloroform. the patient struggles, but soon his moans subside and he is unconscious.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{how long has this man been here?}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{three quarters of an hour.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{mmmm. hodges, pierce come closer. mr. hill, take hold of the rope please. it's a machine accident. i expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.}
<A>__{the two medical students come forward. they stare uneasily at the gaping wound, which bubbles each time the man takes an agonized breath. treves and fox quickly and expertly tend the wound as hodges and pierce look on.}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(off handedly)}
<D>__{abominable things these machines. one can't reason with them.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{what a mess.}
<A>__{treves now notices that the student's faces have gone a trifle ashen.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{what got you into medicine, hodges?}
<C>__{hodges}
<D>__{my father, sir. he's built quite a successful practice. i hope to take it over one day.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{is that your case as well, pierce?}
<C>__{pierce}
<D>__{yes sir. though of course i do have a great desire to help my fellowman.}
<A>__{treves smiles at them knowingly.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{of course you do realize that medicine has changed quite a bit since your father's time. in those days we didn't even wash our coats. in fact, the sign of a truly accomplished surgeon was his black operating coat, so stiff with dried blood and pus that it could stand up by itself in the corner. i've still got mine upstairs... you don't mind blood, do you? hodges & pierce}
<P>__{oh no, sir. (etc.)}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{good, that's one thing we've always plenty of.}
<B>__{hallway}
<A>__{a hospital messenger boy, dressed in a blue uniform and a can is making his way down the hall. he stops and looks into an operating room much like the one we have just seen. inside, the room is empty. the boy closes the door and continues on to another operating room. the doctors move with great urgency around the operating table. blood is draining down into a white porcelain bowl. a woman can be heard moaning. the boy looks carefully, but finally closes the door and continues on his way. treves' operating room there is a hissing sound and steam from the cauterizing of the wound comes up obscuring part of treves' face. the patient is being held down firmly by the other men. the door opens and treves looks up. the boy pops his head in.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{excuse me, mr. treves, sir.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{i found it.}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(studying the boy carefully)}
<D>__{did you see it?}
<A>__{the boy shakes his head slowly, "no."}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i will be with you in a moment ...}
<A>__{the boy closes the door.}
<C>__{fox}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i say freddie, what are you about?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.}
<A>__{aerial shot from third floor of the london hospital looking down on the hospital square. below, treves is walking briskly across the square, through a gate and into the slums beyond. the aerial shot is actually fox's pov, and now we see fox filled with curiosity, watching the figure from a window. looking down from above and to the side of him, we follow treves walking through a cobblestone street still wet from a recent rain, covered with horse manure and filth of all sorts. the air is smoky from meat burning fires. rounding a corner, we see and approach the painted canvas sign of "the elephant man" covering the front of a small, dingy shop. the door of the shop is windowless and padlocked. treves walks into the picture, studies the whole scene for a moment, goes to the shop door and finds that it is padlocked. treves tries to look under an edge of the canvas. to his left he sees a small boy watching him intently.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{do you know where the proprietor is?}
<A>__{he holds a coin out. the boy nods, snatches the coin and then disappears around the corner. treves turns back to the canvas.}
<B>__{a pub}
<A>__{a noisy pub, long and narrow. benches run the length of the back wall, with small tables up against them. men are clustered around the bar, talking in groups. we see the boy standing at one of the tables talking to the owner, greedily consuming his lunch as he listens. the boy gestures outside.}
<B>__{outside the pub}
<A>__{the boy comes out the door, quickly followed by the owner hurriedly putting on his coat, fumbling with a riding crop, the last of his sandwich stuffed in his mouth.}
<B>__{at the corner}
<A>__{the boy and the owner are carefully looking around the corner at treves still in front of the portrait.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{he's not a peeler...}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{no, i don't think so.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{no... i don't think so.}
<A>__{they walk into the street.}

<A>__{the owner and the boy walk up to treves.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{are you the proprietor?}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{and who might you be, sir?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{just one of the curious. i'd like to see it.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{i don't think so. no sir, we're closed.}
<A>__{treves pulls a purse from his coat, extracts a coin and holds it out.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i'd pay handsomely for a private showing. are you the proprietor?}

<D>__{handsomely?... who sent you?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{pardon me?}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{never mind. i'm the owner.}
<A>__{he snatches the money.}
<B>__{inside the shop}
<A>__{total darkness. we hear the sound of the padlock being removed. the door opens and light streams in. the canvas covering the windows at the front of the shop obscures all other light. the owner enters, followed by treves and the boy. from his expression, as well as treves', we can tell there must be an awful stench in the room. no one says a word. the boy closes the door, while the owner lights a small gas light. we can now see the shop. it it empty, grey with dust, cold and dank. some old tins and a few shriveled potatoes occupy a shelf. the far end of the shop is blocked off by a curtain suspended from a cord by a few rings. the owner approaches it.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{here we are sir.}
<P>__{(ticking it off by rote)}
<D>__{life is full of surprises. ladies and gentlemen, consider the fate of this creature's poor mother. in the fourth month of her maternal condition, she was struck down by a wild elephant}
<P>__{(leering)}
<D>__{struck down, if you take my meaning, on an uncharted african isle. the result is plain to see ladies and gentlemen... the terrible elephant man!}
<A>__{the rings rattle back, and the curtain is omen. we see a bent figure crouching on a stool, covered by a brown blanket. in front of it on a tripod is a large brick, heated from below by a bunsen burner. from the blanket protrudes a perfectly normal left arm and hand warming itself over the brick. it does not move when the curtain is drawn. treves steps closer. the owner, watching his every move, turns and smiles at him. he bangs his riding crop on the wall and yells to the crouched figure, as if speaking to a dog.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{stand up!}
<A>__{the boy, excited by his own fear, mimics the owner.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{stand up!}
<A>__{the figure comes forward and lets the blanket fall to the ground and we see the elephant man himself. treves, his eyes wide with horror and wonder, his mouth frozen open, steps backward in an instinctive movement of self preservation. the owner laughs. the elephant man is naked to the waist, his feet are bare and he wears a pair of worn trousers from a fat man's dress suit. he is a little below average height, and looks shorter from the bowing of his back. his head is enormous and misshapen, as big around as a man's waist. from his brow projects a huge boney mass, almost obscuring his right eye. his nose is a nose of flesh, recognizable only from its position. from the upper jaw projects another mass of bone protruding from the mouth like a stump, turning the upper lip inside out, making a slobbering aperture. it almost gives the impression of a rudimentary trunk or tusk. on top of his head is a handful of lank, black hair. at the back of it hangs a bag of spongy skin, resembling cauliflower. these loathsome growths cover his back and hang down to the middle of his thighs. the right arm is enormous and shapeless, the hand like a knot of tuberous roots. his left arm is not only normal, but delicately shaped, with fine skin and a hand that any woman might envy. from his chest hangs another bag of flesh, like the dewlap of a lizard. his legs are also grossly deformed, his feet great stumps. behind him, as painted in the portrait, are two crudely constructed palm trees. the owner harshly raps again.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{turn around!}
<A>__{the elephant man begins to turn. the boy filled with malicious glee at seeing the monster obey, screams.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{turn around! turn around!}
<A>__{the elephant man completes his turn and comes to rest. we see a close up of the elephant man looking at treves. his face is utterly devoid, and incapable, of expression. we see the elephant man's eyes. he closes them.}
<B>__{outside the shop}
<A>__{the owner is locking up. treves, facing the street, drinks in the fresh air. he is trying to forget his shock, put everything into focus. he looks at the garish portrait again. treves produces his purse. the owner, smelling money, turns. treves hands him several coins.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{so you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? mr...?}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{bytes. mr. bytes. he'll be there.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i will send a cab. here is my card.}
<A>__{treves hands the owner a card. the owner, greasy and dirty, shakes treves' hand and squeezes his arm.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{now we got a deal... we understand each other... guv. we understand each other completely.}
<A>__{the owner gives treves the evil look of a conspirator. treves walks off, disoriented. the owner reads the card and smiles at treves walking away down the street.}
<T>__{dissolve to outside the shop:}
<A>__{a cabman is knocking on the door of the shop, staring at the portrait. the door opens, revealing a figure in a floor length black cloak. on his head is an extremely large hat, cut to the lines of a yachting cap. a grey flannel curtain hangs from the bottom of the cap all the way around, hiding his face. there is a horizontal slit in front for the eyes. on the figure's feet are large, bag like slippers. the only part of the body seen at all is the left arm and hand, which protrudes from the cloak, holding a crude walking stick. the figure seems to loathe being in the open. we can just barely see in the darkness within the owner standing to one side of the door, obviously enjoying the surprise on the cabman's face. the owner steps abruptly into his view.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{don't just stand there. help him up.}
<A>__{the cabman, does so, while a small, curious crowd forms. the owner gives the cabman the card. the cabman jumps up onto the seat and off they go. the receiving room london hospital the receiving room is a bare hall, painted stone color. it has rows of benches and a long desk where entries are made, and certificates and other papers are issued. it is a cold, harsh place.}
<C>__{cabman}
<D>__{not at all, sir. my... pleasure.}
<A>__{he exits. treves turns and sees the matron, staring.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i will be in my rooms, mothershead. i'm not to be disturbed.}
<A>__{she nods silently. treves looks at the figure for a moment.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{come with me, please.}
<A>__{he starts to go out of the room. the hooded figure just stands there, motionless. we see the whole room, the people now silent. they all stare at the figure. no one makes a move.}
<C>__{matron}
<D>__{you heard the doctor... go on.}
<A>__{treves turns to look at the hooded figure who stands there a moment, then slowly shuffles after him. mrs. mothershead and the people in the room watch him go. when he is out of sight, they all begin to talk excitedly. mothershead stands fixed and watches too, ignoring the noisy room. treves' office the door opens and treves leads the hooded figure to a chair in front of his desk and helps him to sit down, furtively trying to look into the eye slit of the mask. in the small room the smell of the elephant man is overwhelming. treves goes to the window and opens it. he nervously tries to compose himself, then turns to the hooded figure.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{my name is frederick treves... i am a surgeon here at the london hospital, and i lecture in anatomy at the medical college... i would very much like to examine you. would that be all right?}
<A>__{the figure in the chair is still. treves is at a loss. his sense of discomfort is growing. he looks at the floor for a moment, then locks his eyes on the figure's left arm.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{ah... yes. um, first i would like to ask you a few questions, would that be all right?}
<A>__{the figure does nothing. treves sits down at his desk and picks up a pencil.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{good. now, let's see. your owner... um, the man who... who looks after you tells me that you are english and your name is john merrick. is that correct?}
<A>__{the figure does nothing.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{do you know where you were born? where you come from?}
<A>__{the figure does nothing.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i tell you what, i will ask you a question, and you shake your head like this for "no" and nod like this for "yes", alright? do you understand?}
<A>__{the figure following treves' movements nods very slowly, "yes". treves sighs with relief.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{are you in any pain?}
<A>__{the figure begins to babble incoherently. treves, alarmed, interrupts.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{um, no. just nod your head like this for "yes" and shake it like this for "no". now, are you in any pain?}
<A>__{again the figure, following treves movements, shakes his head "no".}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{are your parents still alive?}
<A>__{the figure does nothing. treves is quite nervous.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{do you understand? are they dead? your father... your mother?}
<A>__{the figure begins to moan. there are two sharp raps at the door. the hooded figure flinches. the door opens and fox pokes his head into the room.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{freddie, what you doing for... i say do open a window in here or...}
<A>__{he notices the hooded figure.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{oh, i'm dreadfully sorry, i had no idea that... i say!}
<A>__{treves quickly rises and pushes fox out into the hallway, following him and closing the door.}
<B>__{in the hallway}
<A>__{treves and fox are standing outside the door to treves' office.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{good lord, freddie! what have you got in there?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{you'll know presently. at the meeting of the society. but until then, i beg of you fox, keep it to yourself.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{certainly, if you insist. you must have quite a find there.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i don't know what i've got.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{nothing of any importance, eh?}
<A>__{treves turns to go back in, then stops.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i will tell you this much, fox, it's beyond anything you or i have ever dealt with. keep it to yourself, please.}
<A>__{he goes back in, shutting the door. treves' office treves turns the key in the door. he turns to the chair the figure had been occupying, but he is not there. the figure is hiding in the corner, crouched behind a black frock operating coat, so stiff with dried blood and pus it stands up by itself. treves looks quickly around the room and finally sees him. he looks at the figure for a moment.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{come sit down.}
<A>__{the frightened figure just crouches there looking at him. treves goes to him, pulls him up and over to the chair.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{sit... down.}
<A>__{the figure sits. treves pauses uncertainly.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i think i will examine you now. i will save the questions for later... will you take off your hat now, please?}
<A>__{the figure does nothing. treves moves to him.}

<C>__{treves}
<D>__{he is english, he is twenty one years of age and his name is john merrick. gentlemen, in the course of my profession i have come upon lamentable deformities of the face due to injury or disease, as well as mutilations and contortions of the body, depending upon like causes; but, at no time have i met with such a dreaded or perverted version of a human being as this man. i wish to draw your attention to the insidious conditions affecting this patient. note, if you will, the extreme enlargement of the skull... and upper limb, which is totally useless. the alarming curvature of the spine... turn him, please... the looseness of the skin, and the varying fibrous tumors that cover 90% of the body.}
<A>__{treves' voice fades as we dissolve to : the doctors, who at first were rigid and flustered, and now bent forward, concentrating, obviously consumed with interest. spiraling down again we see treves finishing his lecture.}

<A>__{merrick as before the light is very dim. we hear the echoing footfalls of the night porter coming up the stairs. merrick's head immediately comes up from his knees. as it does, a small object falls from where his head rested. he picks it up and puts it in a pocket of his cloak. it is the portrait of the beautiful woman, which he saw in his dream. suddenly the door swings open and the night porter, bottle in hand, is standing there. he walks into the room and sees merrick's shape on the bed.}

<D>__{now please, john, you must do as i say. come up from there.}
<A>__{he starts to help merrick up, but merrick just presses himself farther back in the corner, still babbling. there are two raps at the door. treves goes to it and lets mothershead in.}

<D>__{good morning, mr. treves. it'll be his bath time soon. has he eaten?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{not quite yet, mrs. mothershead. there seems to be some difficulty this morning.}

<D>__{no! don't pull at him like that. we don't want to frighten him more than he already is.}
<A>__{by this time mothershead has almost got him back on the bed.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{honestly, sir, you must be very firm with this sort. otherwise they'd lay about on the floor gibbering all day long. all he understands is a good smack.}
<A>__{they help merrick settle back on the pillow. merrick is still making desperate, unintelligible sounds.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{he's had his share of "smacks", mothershead. i expect that's what drives him under the bed. we must use patience and understanding with this man.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{perhaps you've got the time for that, mr. treves, i certainly don't. i've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. i don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? i will be back later for his bath. and mr. carr gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. good day sir.}

<A>__{treves carefully mouths the word.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{"yes."}

<D>__{i'm sure that if mr. merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. now i'm not expecting miracles. i'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but i do think that i can get him to speak for himself. i'm going to arrange things with carr gomm right now.}

<C>__{treves}
<D>__{he's doing very well. in fact that's why i came to see you. i think that if i were to present mr. merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. if the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, i'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.}

<D>__{well sir, perhaps i should explain...}

<D>__{yes, i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables. i'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{fine, fine. you know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, treves. but you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.}

<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{...i... everyone has been very kind to me.}

<D>__{the lord is my shepherd, i shall not want. he maketh me to lie down in green pastures...}
<P>__{(he continues through the following dialogue)}
<A>__{treves and carr gomm are alone on the landing, speaking quietly.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{it was a nice try, treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{yes, i'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{i'm sorry too. he simply doesn't belong here. he's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. believe me, frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. good day.}
<A>__{merrick has come to the end of what treves taught him to say. he makes one last, desperate attempt to be heard. treves, disheartened, stands on the landing as carr gomm starts down the stairs.}

<P>__{(now full voice)}
<D>__{yea, though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death, i will fear no evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me...}

<D>__{what is it, treves?}
<C>__{merrick }
<D>__{thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, thou anointest my head with oil...}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i didn't teach him that part!}
<A>__{treves rushes back into the room, followed by carr gomm.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{my cup runneth over. surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life, and i shall dwell in the house of the lord forever.}
<A>__{there is a long silence as all three men stare at each other.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{how did you, know the rest? i never taught you the rest of it.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{tell me, john, how did you know the rest of the 23rd psalm?}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{i... i used to read the bible every day. i know it very well. the bible, and the book of common prayer. the 23rd psalm is very beautiful.}

<D>__{i want to see you in my office as soon as you're through up here. we've a good deal to discuss.}
<A>__{he starts down the stairs.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{of course, sir. thank you, thank you very much.}
<A>__{carr gomm stops on the stairs.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{treves. well done.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{not me, sir. mr. merrick. he succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.}
<B>__{isolation ward}
<A>__{merrick is on the bed, propped up by pillows. the door opens. treves comes in, shuts the door and leans against it. they look at each other for a moment.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? why didn't you tell me you could read?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you did not ask me.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i never thought to ask. how can you ever forgive me?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{oh, no do not say that. you have been so kind to me. i was afraid to say too much. people always want me to be quiet. you wanted me to speak, but i was afraid. forgive me.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{we do have a lot to talk about, don't we?}
<A>__{carr gomm's office carr gomm is seated at the window, looking out silently. there is a knock at the door and treves enters. he quietly closes the door and walks to the window. carr gomm never moves.}

<C>__{treves}
<D>__{yes, i think i can.}

<D>__{no you can't. you can't begin to know, no one can.}
<A>__{carr gomm suddenly stands and faces treves.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{you are quite right, treves, this is an exceptional case. and i quite agree that the committee should see mr. merrick.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i could easily arrange...}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{no, not that way. broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. it makes them queasy... do you have any photographs of mr. merrick?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{well, yes.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{excellent. we shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. i want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. you and i shall vouch for his inner qualities.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{do you think they'll go along with us?}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{of course they will. they're reasonable men.}
<B>__{isolation ward}
<A>__{merrick is in bed, very tired. it's been an exhausting day. suddenly the door opens and mothershead comes into the room. merrick looks up at her very apprehensively. she walks over to the bed, picks up the bible from the table, opens it and hands it to merrick.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{read it.}
<A>__{merrick looks down at the bible.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.}
<A>__{mothershead backs slowly to the door, deeply disturbed. she stares at merrick for a moment.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{credit where credit is due. you'll have the paper every morning at breakfast.}
<A>__{she quickly turns and exits. merrick looks down at the bible. it is open to "lamentations". hallway the london (night) as before the lights are going off in one hallway after another. the hallways are empty, dark and silent. we hear the great iron door close with a bang. isolation ward (night) merrick is in his bed as always. he holds the portrait of the beautiful woman, gazing at it longingly. he hears a door close far away in the silence of the hospital. suddenly we hear the heavy footfalls of the night porter's boots. as they get louder and louder we move slowly closer to merrick's face. the sound is very close now, and merrick's eyes are visibly agitated. finally, the door bursts open and the night porter is standing there. he stares malevolently at merrick for a long moment and then walks to him menacingly.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{i hear you have some trouble sleepin'...}
<A>__{he grabs merrick fiercely by the hair and jerks his head back. merrick immediately starts to wheeze and gasp.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{head's too heavy, eh?}
<A>__{he pulls merrick all the way down onto the bed, so that he is prone, struggling for breath.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{and i heard a nasty rumor about you; i heard you can talk but you can't, can you... can you... can you?...}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(struggling)}

<A>__{the night porter is as first surprised, and then pleased at the desperate sound.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{no... no you can't! one word about me out of that stinking cakehole... just one word, and you'll have no trouble at sleepin'... no trouble at all. you understand me? do you!!}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(croaking)}
<D>__{yyyesss.}
<A>__{satisfied, the night porter rights merrick who is just able to catch his breath. the night porter smiles and pats merrick on the shoulder.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{there now, that's better, i'n' it?}
<B>__{hallway}
<A>__{treves and carr gomm are on their way to the committee meeting, confident of their position. treves is holding a folder, and carr gomm is looking at the photographs of merrick.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{as far as i can see, the only obstacle might be broadneck. he has enormous influence over the others, very old school, not an easy man to impress. in any case, if worse does come to worse, we still have the british and royal homes to fall back on, don't we.}
<A>__{treves is silent. they stop.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{don't we?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{no, we don't. their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take mr. merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. they don't want him.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{well, it's up to us then, isn't it?}
<A>__{they continue walking.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{don't worry treves, we'll make them see it our way.}
<A>__{he looks at the pictures.}

<D>__{they've eyes, haven't they?}
<A>__{they go through a door marked "committee room". committee room the london hospital we see a pair of hands. one of the photographs of merrick is passed to them. they hold it for a moment, then lay it down flat on the table. one of the hands covers the photograph with a piece of paper.}
<C>__{treves }
<D>__{...due to the progressive nature of the disease, i feel sure that the patient does not have much longer to live.}
<A>__{we pan up from the hands to see broadneck, his face pinched with disgust. he sniffs, and gazes coolly at treves.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{forgive the redundancy, gentlemen, but there is no other place for him. both the royal hospital and the british home have turned him down even if sufficient funds for his care were provided. the workhouse is certainly out of the question. the patient has an overwhelming fear of returning to the horrors of his past. his appearance is so disturbing that all shrink from him. he cannot, in justice to others, be put in the general ward of the workhouse. the police rightly prevent his being exhibited, and he is mobbed in the streets wherever he goes. what is to be done with him?}
<C>__{broadneck}
<D>__{i, for one, am sick and tired of this competitive freak hunting by these overly ambitious young doctors, trying to make names for themselves. to parade then about in front of the pathological society is one thing, but to waste this committee's valuable time with requests for shelter for these abominations of nature is quite another.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{gentlemen, john merrick is not an animal, he is a man, fully aware of his condition. an intelligent, sensitive, literate man, with an intimate knowledge of the bible. his horrible infirmities do not reduce him to anything less than what he is, a man; and it would be criminal if we of the london hospital, his final refuge, the last place on earth where this man can find peace, were to cast him out.}
<A>__{carr gomm, from his chair on the committee, pounds his gavel.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{gentlemen, may i make a suggestion. there are two small rooms off bedstead square that are no longer in use and would be admirably suited to mr. merrick's needs. i also propose to write a letter to the times, appealing to their readers for assistance. knowing the generosity of the british public, i feel we would have little trouble in raising the funds for his maintenance. indeed, this hospital's rules do preclude the admission of incurables, but if ever there was an exception to the rule, it is this patient. so therefore, i propose, if mr. treves is finished, that we put it to a vote. all those in favor of keeping mr. merrick here?}
<A>__{carr gomm and another committee member raise their hands. broadneck is displeased.}
<C>__{broadneck}
<D>__{one moment,}
<P>__{(showing the picture of merrick)}
<D>__{as far as i'm concerned this creature has no business being in our hospital. i think mr. carr gomm's letter would be an excellent idea,}
<P>__{(to carr gomm)}
<D>__{and when you appeal for funds, i think you should appeal for a more appropriate place for him as well. i agree the british public is generous, and i'm sure that somewhere the creature will find a happy and permanent home, but not here.}
<A>__{one of the committee members says "i quite agree". carr gomm scowls a bit.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{i see. all, then, that move we keep mr. merrick here?}
<A>__{carr gomm raises his hand. none of the others do. treves and carr gomm exchange hopeless glances. carr gomm looks at the man who had originally raised his hand. he looks away, ashamed.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{all those opposed?}
<A>__{broadneck and the rest raise their hands.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{broadneck}
<P>__{(triumphantly)}
<D>__{well then. in the meantime, of course, he needn't be turned out. he may stay in the rooms off bedstead square until such time as more suitable arrangements can be made, thus freeing the isolation ward for more deserving patients. well then, mr. chairman, if there is nothing further to discuss, i move that we adjourn this meeting and all go bout our normal business.}
<A>__{carr gomm cannot conceal his contempt.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{i second the motion gentlemen. this meeting is adjourned.}
<A>__{the others cough their agreement and hurriedly leave the room. treves walks over to the committee table and takes the paper off the photograph. he stares sadly at merrick's picture.}
