<L>__{exterior harbor night}
<A>__{the shadowy cloaked figures making their way down to the harbor are hector and thalia. nearer the harbor we sense the nighttime work of loading and preparing ships for the morning tide. by the light of oil lamps cargos are manhandled aboard, voices shout, winches creak. hector encounters a night watchman, but diverts his suspicion by boldly addressing him.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i have some mail for tyre... where are the east bound ships?}
<C>__{watchman}
<D>__{ask at the harbor.}
<A>__{with an authoritative nod, hector strides off in the direction of the noise and lights, thalia at his heels. hector talks when the watchman is out of earshot.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{we want a timber ship... they go west... straight to rome...}
<C>__{thalia}
<D>__{and then? then you go home?}
<A>__{hector hurries on, noncommittal in his reply.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you can go to anywhere from rome.}
