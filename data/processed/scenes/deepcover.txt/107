<B>__{night}
<A>__{they get out of the car. carver takes out a flask, has a drink, offers it to hull who declines.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{never have, never will.}
<P>__{(puts the flask away)}
<D>__{i want you to give me your gun. you're coming in right now.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(doesn't understand)}
<D>__{coming in where?}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{your assignment has been terminated. you're not going out there again. if i have to, i will put you in custody.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(uncomprehending)}
<D>__{i'm going to have gallegos in two days.}
<A>__{carver says nothing. suddenly hull understands.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you're protecting him. you're protecting gallegos.}
<A>__{carver snorts: ridiculous.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{no, of course. that's why you wanted to bust elias and betty. i was getting close, and you wanted to cut this off then... what is he, the new noriega? helps you fight commies, so you let him sell drugs to the niggers. two birds with one stone.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{you violated orders, so you're through. don't make a conspiracy theory out of it.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i'm through...? then, i might as well have a drink after all.}
<A>__{surprised, carver reaches for the flask. as he does, hull grabs him, pushes him out over the edge of the building, holds him there.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now tell me the truth or they're going to decide your troubles got the best of you.}
<A>__{carver struggles. hull pushes him out farther. carver dangles.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{you're insane.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{all the more reason to do what i say. jesus, ger, i'm having trouble holding on...}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{all right!}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{say it!}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{it's the state department.}
<A>__{hull pulls him back in. carver slumps against the wall, drinks greedily. hull lets him for a moment, then takes the flask away.}
<C>__{carver}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i told you, gallegos's uncle is a big deal down there.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{guzman.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{guzman, right. our government supports guzman because he's a moderate. that's a right winger who's pro u.s.}
<P>__{(he doesn't like it either)}
<D>__{if gallegos got busted here, it would hurt guzman's political career there. it's politics, john, not drugs.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{drugs is politics. politics is drugs...}
<P>__{(sickened)}
<D>__{christ, gerry, i dealt drugs. i killed a man. others died. what did i do all this for? for nothing.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{i'm going to washington, john. i will bring you with me. we'll have clout, money...}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(outraged)}
<D>__{i didn't do this for clout or money. you said we were gonna do some good.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{we tried.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{trying's for college boys.}
<P>__{(his head on fire)}
<D>__{if all there is is power and money... if all there is... then what am i doing here? 'cause i can get more power and money out on the street, i got more there already, than i'd ever get kissing your ass in washington...}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{but you can't do that, john. it's not you.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{me? there is no me. we took care of that. first i was a cop pretending to be a dealer. now i'm just a dealer pretending to be a cop. why not stop pretending...? quit the force. be a dealer.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{it's not that simple.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{my assignment's already terminated. all i have to do is quit. i hereby quit.}
<P>__{(lifts the flask)}
<D>__{my first one.}
<P>__{(drinks)}
<D>__{not so bad.}
<A>__{he slips the flask in his pocket, gets in the car, starts engine.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{don't blow your cover.}
<A>__{hull drives off, leaving carver alone on the roof.}
