<L>__{exterior side alley that moment dusk}
<A>__{vicki rounds the corner just as batman lobs a smoke pellet into the doorway of the fluegelheim.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{get in the car!}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{which car?}
<A>__{vicki suddenly feels quite stupid. because while there are many cars parked along the side alley there is only one batmobile.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{... oh.}
<A>__{the batmobile is sleek, futuristic, and... well, indescribable. imagine your own. vicki climbs into the passenger seat and is immediately dazzled by a stunning array of electronic gadgetry.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{ignition!}
<A>__{as batman sprints down the alley, a computer display on the dashboard registers his unique voiceprinterior a tinny, synthesized voice repeats the command:}
<C>__{computer}
<D>__{ignition.}
<A>__{the engines are revving up even as batman vaults into the cockpit alongside vicki. guns in hand, the joker's goons are stumbling out of the fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. they dive for their lives as the batmobile comes barrelling out of the alley at ninety miles an hour. the joker emerges just as the batmobile careens off.}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{i want him!! i want him!!}
<A>__{the joker climbs into the back of a van labelled "monarch playing cards." half his goons pile into the van behind him, the other half into a second car nearby.}
