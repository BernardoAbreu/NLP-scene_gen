<L>__{interior restaurant night}
<A>__{expensive, upscale. we find nick and kell at a table. she's got her menu, but her attention's really on nick. he's toying absently with his wine glass.}
<C>__{kell}
<D>__{where are you?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(catches himself)}
<D>__{million miles away. sorry.}
<C>__{kell}
<D>__{don't be. this guy's really doing a number on your head, isn't he?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah. i guess he is.}
<P>__{(she expects more)}
<D>__{it's...killing his cellmate. i need that to make sense.}
<C>__{kell}
<D>__{why? happens in prison all the time.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah, i know, but...we're not talking some gang banger. this man is precise. does things for a reason.}
<C>__{kell}
<D>__{he's psycho. you said so yourself. we saw it on that video. psychos don't need a reason, nick. they're just psycho.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{whatever. you'll figure it out. you always do.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{thanks. i'm a poor excuse, though. it's date night. you deserve better.}
<P>__{(a glance around)}
<D>__{just wish you'd picked another restaurant.}
<C>__{kell}
<D>__{this is our place. you love it here.}
<P>__{(as a waiter approaches)}

<C>__{waiter}
