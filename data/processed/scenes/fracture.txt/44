<C>__{uniform cop}
<D>__{we established a perimeter around the house and then waited for swat and the negotiator. it was strictly by the book.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{so the house was completely surrounded within how long of the first shots?}
<A>__{crawford sits alone at the defense table. he wears an expensive suit and no handcuffs, but two deputies sit behind him. he's barely listening to the testimony drawing on his legal pad: intricate, dense complex diagrams of "rube goldberg" contraptions.}
<C>__{uniform cop}
<D>__{maybe ten minutes.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{and when you arrived at the sc }
<A>__{crawford noisily tears a page off his pad. looks up sees willy, and everyone else, turned to him.}

<C>__{uniform cop}
<D>__{oh yeah. neighbors, came out to look soon as it started.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{and from what you could ascertain, no one went into or came out of the house until swat and the negotiator arrived?}
<C>__{uniform cop}
<D>__{definitely not.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{thank you. no further questions.}
<C>__{judge robinson}
