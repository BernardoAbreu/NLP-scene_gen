<L>__{exterior laforche backyard evening}
<A>__{the sun has just set and a purple hue hangs over everything. curtis stands in the very back of the yard and watches a man guide a long, flatbed trailer up the driveway. an 18 foot metal shipping container rides on the back.}
<L>__{interior kitchen continuous}
<A>__{nat and samantha sit at the kitchen table going over a list of food in a note pad.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{i know they just usually do oysters and fries but what if we did something healthier on the side?}
<C>__{nat}
<D>__{what like slaw?}
<A>__{nat gets up to refill her drink. she looks out the back door and surveys the construction zone. a forklift lowers the shipping container into the giant hole in the backyard. nat shakes her head.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe a vegetable or salad.}
<C>__{nat}
<D>__{dewart's been tellin' me how strange curtis has been actin' lately. i am so sorry.}
<A>__{nat brings her drink back to the table and sits. samantha doesn't look up from her pad.}
<C>__{nat }
<D>__{it's not like you don't have enough on your plate with hannah.}
<A>__{nat puts her hand on samantha's. samantha moves it.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{things are fine. we're fine.}
<A>__{nat smiles sympathetically.}
