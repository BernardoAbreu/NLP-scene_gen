<L>__{exterior pit night}
<A>__{denise fights her way through the earth and pulls her body up into the night air. the cool air rushes to her lungs. she crawls free of the hole, gasping for air. she is safe. suddenly... smash! a ghoul has broken through the surface. he grabs denise by the leg and begins to pull her back into the hole. denise screams and begins kicking violently at the ghoul. she breaks and crawls from the ghoul's reach.}
