<L>__{int blacksmith shop day}
<A>__{murky and dark. bellows are pumping. showers of sparks cascade. the blacksmith and his assistant are pounding a metallic sledgehammer litany, beating a huge copper sheet into shape. victor enters. the blacksmith directs his attention to a finished copper piece leaning against the wall. victor runs his hand over the surface. nice.}
<L>__{int maternity ward charity hospital night}
<A>__{a woman lies on a table, screaming as she goes into labor. her water breaks, cascading into a steel bucket. one of the assistants snatches it up, scurries around the corner. victor is waiting in the shadows. money changes hands.}
