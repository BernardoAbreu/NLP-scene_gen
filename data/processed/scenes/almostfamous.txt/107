<A>__{"tiny dancer" continues on the bus stereo. russell sits up front, swathed in a large robe, alone and silent. the others have given him a wide berth. he feels silly, and they know it, and he hates that they know it, which makes him feel foolish. he sits silently. william watches him from four rows back, next to penny. she kisses the top of his forehead, a hero's welcome. he yawns. the song's vocal begins. there is only more silence. then, after a beat, we hear a voice or two, fighting the quiet and singing along. then others... waking up... joining in. then jeff. russell hears them and starts to sing along too, louder now, without turning around. it's a voice everyone wants to hear. like it or not, this is his family.}
