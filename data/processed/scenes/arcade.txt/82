<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior level three, desert later}
<A>__{alex and nick have been walking for a long time. nick is silent, just staring straight ahead at the endless sand. he looks wasted. zoned out. his face is beaded with sweat. once again, their wrist displays begin to beep.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(almost a whisper)}
<D>__{time's up.}
<A>__{nick starts to laugh, sinking to his knees.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{we're fucked. that's it.}
<A>__{alex pulls on nick's arm, forcing him to his feet.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{get up, nick...}
<A>__{nick isn't going anywhere fast. alex tries to drag him forward, but she slips in the sand.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{get up!!!}
<A>__{and then, from off in the distance...}
<C>__{voice }
<P>__{(far away)}
<D>__{alex...help me...}
<A>__{alex turns. she focuses on the horizon and sees a tiny speck. she taps a control on her helmet and her view is magnified. alex's p.o.v. benz is up ahead. buried up to his waist in the blue sand and sinking quickly. he waves his hands for help. and clutched in one of them is the second key.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's benz!!!}
<A>__{alex breaks into a run, and after a moment, nick follows. he's walking, though...in no hurry to reach benz.}
<B>__{on benz}
<A>__{the desert is swallowing him up. only his head and arms remain. he's in a state of total panic.}
<C>__{benz}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{get me out of here! oh god!!!}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{is running at top speed, half stumbling across the dunes. her wrist display is beeping furiously.}
<B>__{benz}
<A>__{his head starts to disappear beneath the sand and his cries are choked off.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{benz!}
<A>__{alex reaches the spot and now, only benz' clutched fist remains. the hand opens and the gold key falls onto the sand. alex dives for benz' hand, but it sinks just before she can reach it. she screams and claws at the sand, trying to find him. she digs and digs, but all she finds is more sand. with each second she becomes more frantic. finally alex stops, noticing the key and idly picking it up.}
<B>__{the sand}
<A>__{around alex erupts and bones come flying up into the air, benz' bones! alex screams. the bones rain down around her in bloody fragments. it's as if the earth has chewed benz up and spit out the nasty bits. at that very moment, the beeps on her wrist display meld into the single tone heralding...}
<B>__{the screamer}
<A>__{as if on cue, it enters level two, breaking the sound barrier.}
<B>__{on nick}
<A>__{as he stands some hundred feet away, oblivious to everything. we can hear alex screaming, but the sound is muffled, distant. nick is staring down at his feet at an area where the sand has hardened like glass. inside the sand glass, nick can make out fractals. he smiles.}
<B>__{the screamer}
<A>__{streaks across the sky towards them, blowing up a maelstrom of sand as it crosses the dunes...}
<B>__{on alex}
<A>__{as she sees that a rabbit hole of sorts has been created where the bones were ejected. actually, not a rabbit hole, but a circular, pulsing mouth with razor sharp teeth. alex realizes, much to her horror, that this is the doorway to level three! alex shouts at nick, trying to break the spell over him.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{run! run!!!}
<A>__{but the screamer is bearing down on him, like a heat seeking missile...}
<B>__{on nick}
<A>__{as he watches the fractals. arcade's face appears in the mirrored sand, smiling back at him.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{goodbye, nick.}
<A>__{at the last possible moment, nick seems to wake from his trance. he sees alex, hears her, then turns. he has about one fear wrought second to realize that the screamer has reached him when... wham!!!!!!!!! the screamer slams into nick at about 200 miles per hour. nick, literally, liquefies. the human body is 95% water, and nick explodes like a water balloon on high impact, blood spraying in a fine mist across the dunes, alex, and everything for a good fifty yards. alex is frozen with terror. you remember your worst childhood nightmare monster? the one you'd see in your room at night as your brain cooked with fever? too paralyzed to call out for mom? well that's the screamer.}
<B>__{the screamer}
<A>__{stands where nick used to be (a red mess on the blue sand now). black as night. like living, roiling lava. smoking, charged red eyes. one third demon, one third balrog, and one third rotting corpse. clad in chains and samurai armor, clinking as it moves. it rear back its head, opens a fanged mouth, and lets loose a roar designed to shake the stars from the sky. then it focuses it's eyes on alex. and it charges.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{unfreezes. she's got seconds to make up her mind, the doorway mouth or the screamer. it's really no choice at all. alex turns and dives straight down into the pulsing mouth. the jaws of the rabbit hole snap shut around her. darkness consumes everything. these words appear on screen, "level three tower of ghosts"}
