<L>__{exterior machine shop night}
<A>__{the machinery is sputtering, and sparking, shorting, steaming as the sea rises. mulligan, in a panic, has backed finnegan and pantucci into a corner. he screams over his headset.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{hanover!...hanover! come in! come in you son of a bitch!}
<A>__{no response. a sucking sound comes from the dark mass of pipes. mulligan spins.}
<C>__{mulligan }
<D>__{hanover!! hanover!!}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{forget them...}
<A>__{mulligan spins back to finnegan and pantucci.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<P>__{(fried)}
<D>__{shut up! you hear me!!}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{...we gotta get outta here now.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{shut up, man, just shut the hell up! i gotta think! i gotta think!!}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{what's there to think about?? that thing back there...}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{there ain't no thing here!! no thing!! there's you him and me!! got it! you him and...}
<A>__{suddenly, mulligan's legs are suddenly jerked out from under him. he hits the floor hard. starts firing wildly. finnegan and pantucci hit the watery deck. bullets ricochet everywhere. mulligan is whipped across the floor. screaming in fear. his pulse rifle goes flying. he's slammed into a metal pylon, then sucked into a dark void in the pipes. all in the blink of an eye. finnegan grabs mulligan's pulse rifle. opens fire. blasting the shit out of anything and everything that moves.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{grab the parts!!}
<A>__{pantucci grabs the knapsack, cramming as many parts as he can into it as finnegan keeps firing into the steaming, creaking, sparking machinery.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{i will cover! move! move!}
<A>__{pantucci doesn't have to be told twice. he runs like hell, with finnegan firing a final burst, and following.}
