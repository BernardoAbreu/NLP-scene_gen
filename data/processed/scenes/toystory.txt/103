<A>__{with mom and andy preoccupied, baby molly looks in her sideview mirror. angle: passenger side mirror the rc car (w woody and buzz) weaves into view and then back out. molly squeals with delight.}
<L>__{exterior street back of moving truck}
<A>__{with slinky's mid section stretched to the limit, he begins to lose his grip on woody.}
<C>__{slinky}
<D>__{i can't hold on much longer!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{slink! hang on!}
<A>__{slinky's hand slips, sending his front shooting back into the moving truck and knocking over all the toys. the rc car sputters to a stop. woody and buzz watch in vain as the family van and moving truck disappear. buzz tosses the remote to the ground in frustration.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{great!}
<B>__{beat}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{woody! the rocket!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{the match!}
<A>__{woody pulls out the match from his holster that sid had put there earlier.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(continued)}
<D>__{yes! thank you, sid!}
<A>__{woody runs around behind buzz, strikes the match against rc's back tire, and is about to light the fuse when...}
<B>__{a car}
<A>__{whizzes right over them, blowing out the match. woody clenches the burnt match in his hands and falls prostrate to the ground.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{no o o! no no no no! no o o!}
<A>__{unable to watch a cowboy cry, buzz bows his head, causing his helmet to block the sun from woody. as buzz's shadow passes over him, woody stops whimpering and looks at his hand.}
<B>__{a white hot dot}
<A>__{like the one generated from sid's magnifying glass, appears on the back of woody's hand. woody leaps up, grabs buzz's helmet and aligns it so the white dot hits the tip of the fuse.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{woody?! what are you doing?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{hold still, buzz!}
<A>__{the fuse lights.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{ha ha!!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{you did it! next stop. andy.}
<A>__{woody jumps back onto the car then suddenly stops smiling.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{wait a minute...i just lit a rocket. rockets explo }
<A>__{sfx: rocket explosion the rc car rockets forward. speeding along the dividing line in the road, it easily passes car after car until the moving truck can be seen on the horizon.}
