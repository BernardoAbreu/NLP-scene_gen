<T>__{slow fade in :}
<A>__{as our eyes adjust to the dim light.}
<C>__{alex's voice }
<D>__{experts say unconsciousness occcurs before pain has time to register. they agree electrocution does not "hurt," could not hurt. but it does. unimaginably. believe me.}
<A>__{we're in the death chamber. dark. claustrophobic. the only light a few panel indicators and spill from the door open from the adjacent observation room to the outside. alex looks at the phone on the wall. silent.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i don't expect a call from the governor. any last words? captain, my captain?}
<A>__{reveal the captain in the chair. a private execution. erin slumped along a side wall. totally inscrutable. intense.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{yeah. fuck you.}
<A>__{a long beat of silence.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{was that it? well, ok.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{i'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. you got that? you think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? bullshit. she was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? you're nothing, corvis! less than nothing.}
<A>__{a figure wipes through frame moving toward the switch. the captain's voice rising as he senses time running out.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{you can't do this to me you little fucks! i will come back, just like you, a big fucking shit spewing bird and three guesses what little bitch i'm taking out first...}
<A>__{close. the switch thrown. zzzzzttt. pan up off the switch to...}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{you are so dead.}
<A>__{she glances at the captain, fibrillating in the chair, starts to move off. then stops, near alex, looking with him at... their pov the zigzag scar fibrillating, as we push into seething detail. writhing bodies, human suffering, a hellish miasma that draws us in until we turn our heads away, released.}
