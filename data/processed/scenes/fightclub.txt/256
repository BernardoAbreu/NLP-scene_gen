<L>__{extreme slow motion:}
<A>__{jack's finger squeezes the trigger... kablam! jack's cheeks inflate with gas. his eyes bulge. blood flies out from his head. the window behind him shatters. smoke wafts out of his mouth and tear ducts. resume normal speed as the glass falls behind jack... tyler stands, in gunsmoke, eyes glazed, sniffs the air...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{what's that smell... ?}
<A>__{jack slumps to the floor... tyler falls... tyler hits the ground. the back of tyler's head is blown open, revealing blood, skull and brain. suddenly, a group of space monkeys burst into the room, moving forward to jack. tyler's body is gone.}
<C>__{tall space monkey}
<D>__{are you all right, sir... ?!}
<A>__{jack quakes, holding the side of his head; a ragged hole blown in his cheek. he's bleeding hard, but he's alive.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm okay...}
<A>__{jack looks to the space monkeys, trying to get his eyes to see. two space monkeys enter with marla. one holds a gun to marla as she struggles.}
<C>__{short space monkey}
<D>__{are you sure? you look terrible, sir! what's happened?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{everything's fine.}
<C>__{another space monkey}
<D>__{sir, you look really awful! do you need medical assistance?}
<A>__{jack sees marla, tries to get to his feet, falls...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{bring the girl to me. the rest of you get out. now!}
<A>__{the monkeys bring marla, releasing her, saluting.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{what happened... ?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't ask.}
<A>__{marla crouches, takes out wadded tissues and tries to apply. them to jack's wound. space monkeys are leaving, hesitantly.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{get to the rendezvous pointerior move it!}
<A>__{jack and marla are left alone.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{my god, you're shot...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{jack tries to got up. marla helps him.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{who did this to you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i did, i think. but, i'm okay... i'm fine...}
<A>__{massive explosion... the glass walls rattle... jack and marla look out the windows: a building explodes; collapsing upon itself. then, another building implodes into a massive cloud of dust. jack and marla are silhouetted against the skyline. jack looks to marla, reaches to take her hand.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm sorry... you met me at a very strange time in my life.}
<A>__{marla looks at him. another building implodes and collapses inward... and another building... and another... the film slows, then advances one frame at a time showing sprocket holes on the sides. each frame is an imploding building then, one frame is a penis. then, the imploding building again. speed up the frames, lose the sprocket holes, resume normal speed...}
