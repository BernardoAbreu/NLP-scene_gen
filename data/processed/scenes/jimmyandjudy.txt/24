<T>__{camera on:}
<L>__{interior therapist's office day}
<A>__{camera is being removed from the camera bag. as the lens pans quickly, we catch a glimpse of jimmy smirking, holding the camera. he's way too close to the lens. he flips it around until it locks on dr. walters, mfcc (40), jimmy's not very accomplished therapist. walters seems to have a very gentle and nonthreatening aura that suggests he's the type of person you would feel comfortable talking to. he sits by the window in his relatively uninteresting office. jimmy has turned on the camera in the middle of their first session together.}
<C>__{dr. walters}
<D>__{jimmy, we discussed this. you can't tape our sessions. it's not allowed.}
<A>__{the camera doesn't move.}
<C>__{dr. walters}
<D>__{you know, you can't film someone who doesn't want their image and voice recorded. technically, you're actually breaking the law.}
<A>__{jimmy (o.c.) doesn't respond.}
<C>__{dr. walters}
<D>__{does your defiance make you feel more powerful?}
<A>__{still no answer.}
<C>__{dr. walters}
<D>__{filming people makes you feel like you're in control of the situation doesn't it?}
<A>__{still no answer.}
<C>__{dr. walters}
<D>__{i can sit here as long as you can. you're not going to be able to force me to participate in your little game here.}
<A>__{no movement from the camera.}
<C>__{dr. walters}
<D>__{jimmy, this isn't something that friends do to each other is it?}
<A>__{dr. walters sits in front of the camera, trying to stay perfectly still and calm. dr. walters is so nice and so calm, that we start to feel sorry for him. no movement. no movement. dr. walters fidgets. then holds still. then fidgets, trying to stay calm.}
<C>__{dr. walters}
<D>__{jimmy, put the camera away, please.}
<A>__{no movement.}
<C>__{dr. walters}
<D>__{you're wasting your time and mine, jimmy. we could be doing something productive.}
<A>__{the camera shakes a bit. jimmy's laughing. dr. walters is doing his best to stay calm.}
<C>__{dr. walters}
<D>__{that's enough.}
<A>__{no movement.}
<C>__{dr. walters}
<D>__{put it away.}
<A>__{nothing.}
<C>__{dr. walters}
<D>__{now jimmy!}
<A>__{dr. walters gets up and comes towards the camera. he grabs it just above the lens and tries to take it away.}
<C>__{dr. walters}
<D>__{come on jimmy.}
<A>__{a fierce battle of tug of war breaks out. we see dr. walters becoming increasingly pissed off. the back and forth is suddenly getting violent, until...}
<C>__{dr. walters}
<D>__{gimme the goddamn fucking camera!}
<A>__{dr. walters finally gets the camera free from jimmy. camera shuts off.}
