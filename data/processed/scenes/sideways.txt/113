<L>__{exterior hitching post night}
<A>__{it's closing time. the front door flies open, and miles staggers out sideways. gary follows him out, concerned.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{you okay, miles?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i'm good.}
<A>__{miles heads in the wrong direction at first, then realizes his mistake and steers himself back toward the windmill.}
<T>__{fade out:}
<B>__{.}
<A>__{under black, a card }
<B>__{wednesday}
<L>__{interior motel room day}
<A>__{the door bursts open, and jack comes bounding in.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{come on, dude. let's go golfing! i got us in at alisal.}
<A>__{miles comes to, very hungover.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{that's a public course.}
<P>__{(then )}
<D>__{no stephanie?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she's working. i need a break anyway. she's getting a little clingy.}
<P>__{(magnanimous)}
<D>__{this is our day!}
<L>__{exterior golf course day}
<A>__{whack! jack tees off with a manly athletic swing and shades his eyes to watch the ball's trajectory.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{crap.}
<A>__{miles, disheveled and sullen, approaches the teebox, sticks a tee in the ground and sets his ball.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{did you ever got ahold of maya yesterday?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she likes you, man. stephanie'll tell you.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(preparing to swing)}
<D>__{can you give me some room here?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(stepping back)}
<D>__{oh yeah. sure.}
<A>__{miles lifts his club.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{thanks, jack.}
<A>__{miles refocuses and swings just as jack offers more helpful advice.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't whiff it.}
<A>__{whack! despite the distraction, miles manages to make a good, long drive.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nice shot.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you're an asshole.}
<A>__{now on the fairway jack is pouring two dixie cups of wine as miles prepares to take his next swing.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what about your agent? hear anything yet?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what do you think's going on?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{could be anything.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{been checking your messages?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{obsessively.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{they probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. i guess i will just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{but you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?}
<A>__{miles says nothing.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{or fuck those new york publishers. publish it yourself. i will chip in. just get it out there, get it reviewed, get it in libraries. let the public decide.}
<A>__{giving jack a look that says jack has no idea what he's talking about, miles takes a stance over the ball and focuses.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't come over the top. stay still.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{just trying to be helpful.}
<P>__{(a moment later)}
<D>__{it's all about stillness, miles. inner quiet.}
<A>__{miles drops his club and turns to jack.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{shut up! shut up! shut up! what's the matter with you, man? shut up!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why are you so hostile? i know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.}
<P>__{(holding out a cup of wine)}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{still fuming, miles begrudgingly accepts the wine and has a taste. he's immediately distracted from his woes.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know. got it from stephanie.}
<A>__{miles downs the rest and is intrigued by the taste.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{huh. let me see the label.}
<A>__{suddenly a golfball thuds against the hard fairway directly behind them.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(whirling around)}
<D>__{what the fuck?}
<A>__{way back on the tee box, some 200 yards away, are a foursome of two couples. one of the men is waving his driver.}
<D>__{husband #1}
<P>__{(shouting, barely audible)}
<D>__{hurry it up, will you?}
<A>__{jack looks at miles, the two incredulous.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{fucker hit into us.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{hey, asshole! that's not cool!}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{throw me his ball.}
<A>__{jack walks over, picks up the offending ball and tosses it to miles. miles gets out his 3 wood and thwock! cuts it back low and hard.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nice shot.}
<B>__{the couples}
<A>__{duck for cover as the ball whistles over their heads.}
<B>__{jack and miles}
<A>__{laugh hard.}
<B>__{the two husbands}
<A>__{climb in their cart and hasten down the fairway toward jack and miles.}
<B>__{jack}
<A>__{watches their approach, grinning.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, this is going to be fun.}
<P>__{(jerking a driver from his bag)}
<D>__{this is going to be fun.}
<A>__{jack heads in their direction, brandishing the club like a medieval knight with a mace. as the husbands get a look at this sight, they turn their cart around and speed back toward their wives.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hit into us again, motherfuckers, and i will ass rape all four of you!}
