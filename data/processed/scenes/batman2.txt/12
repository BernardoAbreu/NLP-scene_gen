<A>__{we're at a makeshift campsite where a cluster of homeless people are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm. they look on in puzzlement as the two snowmobiles whiz past and disappear over a crest of a hill...}
<L>__{exterior lakefront on snowmobiles #3 and #4}
<A>__{they bounce down the hillside and skid arriving at the edge of a frozen over lake. with the roar of the batmobile behind them, the two drivers get the same idea simultaneously. smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface of the lake. now the batmobile crests the ridge. the car's weight tips suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake. batman sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just in time but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope. the prow of the batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake and under its weight, the ice begins to crack. the left front tire takes a sudden dip and worse yet, the car is sliding forward.}
