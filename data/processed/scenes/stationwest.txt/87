<L>__{exterior hotel evening}
<A>__{as haven and mark come out. they walk towards the saloon. people look at them curiously. suddenly, down the street, the sheriff appears, approaching haven slowly and ominously. sensing a gun fight, people vanish. purely from instinct, mark deserts haven's side in a hurried walk towards the saloon, eyeing both. haven comes on leisurely. the sheriff has stopped in his tracks and has his gun out. a woman clutches her child to her skirt. men stand stockstill, watching. a crowd forms at the entrance to charlie's. haven walks slowly forward until he reaches the waiting sheriff. he looks him over with a smile of contempt.}

<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{for the murder of james goddard and robbery under arms!}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{i've heard about you. you don't appear to understand the functions of your office.}
<P>__{(taking sheriff's gun and breaking it open)}
<D>__{you've missed the whole point of your profession.}
<P>__{(showing him)}
<D>__{even your gun isn't loaded.}
<P>__{(haven loads it as it goes on)}
<D>__{i suggest that you start all over again, with this point in mind: the duty of a peace officer is to arrest the culprit of a crime not the victim.}
<A>__{haven hands him back the now loaded gun and walks away towards the saloon, leaving the sheriff standing there, a completely dumbfounded and bepuzzled man.}
