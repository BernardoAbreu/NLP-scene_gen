<A>__{kay moves into the room ahead of the others.}
<L>__{interior cryo cell}
<A>__{close on kay em's eyes they are not human. mechanical, digital, but alluring. they dilate, open up. colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the body. which itself is slumped over. an icicle of frozen blood from, the wound in her shoulder, props the body up. the other enter the icy chamber.}
<C>__{delongpree}

<C>__{janessa}
<D>__{first field trip and you think you're a scientist. move out of the way geek.}
<A>__{janessa moves to look inside the chamber. as the gas and steam clear we hear the sound of cracking ice, see a jagged mass of frozen crystals . . . and within it . . . a body. a chunk of ice cracks and falls tot he floor then the mask of jason voorhees looms forward! janessa screams as jason's body, stiff as a board, crashes to the ground sending ice shrapnel everywhere!}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{jesus, used to make the suckers big didn't they?}
<A>__{again, kay em's eyes scan the frozen body.}
