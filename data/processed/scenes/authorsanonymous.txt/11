<L>__{interior alan and colette's house dining room night}
<A>__{henry, john, alan, colette, hannah, and william sit around the table. impressive buffet of cold cuts, cheeses, and shrimp has been set out.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{our writing group meets every tuesday night. mostly at alan and colette's. sometimes we rotate.}
<A>__{john helps himself to some shrimp. then helps himself to some more.}
<D>__{henry (v.o.) (cont'd) i love coming to the group. everyone always has such constructive feedback. it's like we're all in this together.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{i really like the way yuri is developing, colette.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{well, if you ask john k. butzin...}
<A>__{can't help looking at the camera. making sure it's on him.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{you're still going to have to explain why this natasha dame goes awol on her husband. still kinda iffy to me.}
<A>__{another glance at the camera: did you get that?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i was bothered by that, too. why would natasha betray a reliable, dependable husband for a washed up young punk?}
<A>__{all eyes on colette. she shifts in her chair. uncomfortable.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{oh. well...um...um...}
<A>__{an uneasy silence. colette is blocked nowhere to go creatively. her face tightens up. bites her lip.}
<C>__{colette }
<D>__{oh god. i've been rewriting and rewriting and rewriting and }
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{poodles. it's ok.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{no. it's not ok. i still can't explain natasha's motive. what's the use? i'm not a writer.}
<A>__{william to the rescue.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{whoa. whoa. time out. the dude's good in bed. trust me, that's all the motive she needs.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{roger that. torpedo chapter three. blow it up. get the focus back on this broad natasha.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{ yes. i was thinking the same thing.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{make it clear that natasha wants to be closer...}
<A>__{colette makes notes furiously, nodding in agreement.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{writing can be such a solitary existence, so it's good to have this outlet where you can meet other writers and exchange ideas. here it really is all for one and one for all.}
