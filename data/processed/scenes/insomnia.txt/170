<L>__{interior boathouse}
<A>__{the boathouse. old, rotted wood. crumbling beams. walter stands at a window. re loading his shotgun. he fumbles, drops a shell. it rolls towards a crack in the floor. falls into the lake water below. click! walter levels the shotgun out the window. walter's pov the long, undulating weeds outside.}
<L>__{exterior weeds}
<A>__{will. pulling himself through the weeds. losing blood fast. dragging his body. approaches the side of the boathouse. walter's gun barrel, sticking out. will ducks his head. winces in pain. breathing, becoming ragged. rounds to the other side. hoists himself up to another window. cautiously looks in... walter at the far window. will jerks back. steps on the dock. a plank creaks. shit. peers back through the window. walter. still looking out. didn't hear a thing. will remembers. walter doesn't have his hearing aid. he's deaf on that side.}
