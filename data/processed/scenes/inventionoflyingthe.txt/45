<L>__{exterior bellagio night}
<A>__{mark pulls in front of the bellagio hotel and casino. both mark, and a very hungover looking greg, pop out of the car. mark hands the keys to the valet and they both stumble inside.}
<L>__{interior bellagio night}
<A>__{it's the bellagio. we've all been there.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{what are we doing here? we don't have any money to throw away.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{sure we do.}
<A>__{mark pulls out a small wad of money.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{what is that, a few hundred bucks? that's not going to last us very long.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{sure it will.}
<A>__{mark and greg step up to the chip counter. mark slides his small wad through the window.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{chips please.}
<A>__{the chip woman looks at his money.}
<C>__{chip woman}
<D>__{there's a very good chance you'll lose all this money here tonight.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{chip woman}
<D>__{and even if you do happen to win, there's an even better chance that in the long run we'll win it back.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{chip woman}
<D>__{some of the games are fixed. like all the ones that use computers.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{the woman slides him a short stack of chips. greg frowns. mark and greg walk towards the tables. mark and greg look around. a cocktail waitress approaches.}
<C>__{cocktail waitress}
<D>__{if i could be a stripper i would, but i'm not attractive enough. drinks, guys?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{no. i have a stomach flu.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{we'll both have beers and we'll take them at that roulette table over there.}
<A>__{mark points to a table and walks away. the waitress nods.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{oh come on, roulette is the stupidest game of them all. it's pure chance, no skill whatsoever.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's okay. i'm feeling lucky.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{you've never had a lucky day in your life.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{just watch.}
<A>__{they arrive at the roulette table.}
<C>__{roulette dealer}
<D>__{get your bets in, get your bets in. the house always wins in the long run. because of the zero's on the board every bet is slightly favored towards the house.}
<A>__{mark puts his chips down on seventeen black. the dealer starts the wheel. the ball comes to a stop on twenty seven red.}
<C>__{roulette dealer}
<D>__{twenty seven red. no one wins.}
<A>__{in full view, mark slides his chips over to twenty seven red.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm on twenty seven red.}
<A>__{the dealer looks at this. his brain takes a moment to respond.}
<C>__{roulette dealer}
<D>__{we have a winner. congratulations, sir.}
<A>__{the dealer stacks up mark's new chips and pushes them over to him.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{you did it. you just, like, quadrupled your money. you lucky son of a bitch.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that's nothing. watch this.}
<A>__{mark puts all of his chips on double zero. a bunch of other people scatter their chips around the table as well.}
<C>__{roulette dealer}
<D>__{get your bets in, get your bets in. the house always wins in the long run. fork over your money right here folks. i say this so often i want to kill myself.}
<A>__{the dealer spins the ball. it comes to a halt on nine black.}
<C>__{roulette dealer}
<D>__{nine black. no winners.}
<A>__{mark takes all of the chips on the table, both his and everyone else's and slides them together into a giant pile and sits them right on nine black.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm on nine black. these are all mine.}
<A>__{the table cheers for mark. some people are a bit confused, and a slight hubbub arises in the background: "i thought i had chips on the table." "yeah, me too." "we must be drunk." "that guys is lucky!" even the dealer looks a bit confused... but gets over it quickly.}
<C>__{roulette dealer}
<D>__{nine black wins. big winner. congratulations, sir.}
<A>__{the roulette dealer slides about five grand in chips over to mark. greg's jaw is on the floor.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{do it again.}
<A>__{mark notices the confused people around him.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't think i should. lets go play slots.}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{mark is talking to a pit man right in front of a slot machine.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hi, i just won a major jackpot on this slot machine but no money came out.}
<C>__{pit man}
<D>__{i'm sorry about that, sir. let me get that fixed for you. and can i say congratulations, sir.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{the pit man whispers a few words into his lapel mic.}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{mark and greg, each carrying four giant buckets overflowing with chips, waddle through the casino.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{this is the most amazing night of my life.}
