<L>__{interior bath tub later}
<A>__{tyler and ally lie side by side, drenched. their feet hang over the edge of the tub. tyler reaches into his pocket and removes a dripping cigarette packet. he squeezes out water.}

<D>__{now... i'm furious.}
<A>__{he tosses them in a waste basket.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{you should quit anyway.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{really? why? are cigarettes like bad for you or something?}
<A>__{ally playfully slaps him. she notices the tip of tyler's tattoo peeking out of his undershirt.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{is that a tattoo? let me see.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{it's not really...}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{please. it's very bad ass. all that ritualistic scarring.}
<A>__{tyler peels the soaked garment off his back as ally offers polite applause. michael's name becomes clear. ally takes a long look. she sees tyler's not smiling anymore. she gets it.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{i'm sorry... i didn't... i didn't realize.}
<A>__{she looks at him. asking with out asking.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{he killed himself.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{when he was 21. he had just started working for my father.}
<A>__{ally is gently picking spaghetti and tomatoes off tyler.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{i thought he was a musician.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{he was. but he wasn't making a living doing music and my father's a very compelling guy.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{mine too.}
<A>__{ally looks away for a moment. tucks a curl behind her ear. then they look at each other. ally opens her mouth to speak. aidan bursts in. he's drunk, loud, wearing an irish flag like a cape. he carries a bottle of whiskey and a can of guinness.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{damn, you're not naked.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you're not irish.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{t, what happened in the kitchen? it looks like somebody's water broke.}
<P>__{(notices ally)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{ally, aidan... aidan, ally.}
<A>__{aidan takes ally's hand. kisses it.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{don't feel bad that you're more attracted to me than you are to him it happens to all of them.}
<A>__{ally looks at aidan closely, trying to figure out where she knows him from, it dawns on her.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{oh! you're the assaholic!}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{well, i }
<P>__{(realizes what she said)}
<D>__{wait. what?}
<A>__{tyler and ally laugh. aidan's too drunk to care.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{alright, you two. up. dressed. let's go. "around the world" party on the third floor... a lot of ugly but a lot more alcohol. let's go.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{i can't, i would, i'd love to, but i've gotta get home, my dad's waiting up.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{ally. ally. listen to me, young lady. one drink. from any country. i will even put france on the table. one drink. your choice. and we're gone.}
