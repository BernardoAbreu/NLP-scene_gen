<A>__{andy steps out.}
<C>__{yogi}
<D>__{this is very difficult for me to say... but perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{why?? i... i attend every year.}
<C>__{yogi}
<D>__{yes we do not doubt your devotion to tm. but we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.}
<A>__{andy is stunned.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{"philosophically"?}
<C>__{yogi}
<P>__{(he sighs)}
<D>__{the wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it seems you have no respect for anything.}
<A>__{andy is stupefied. he doesn't know how to respond.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{of course i do...}
<A>__{the yogi shakes his head. andy can't believe it. he looks around men in turbans staring at him. andy cracks.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{please! you've got to let me take the classes! it's how i keep myself balanced!!}
<C>__{yogi}
<D>__{it is apparently not working.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{so help me! all i wanna do is meditate!!}
<C>__{yogi}
<P>__{(pained)}
<D>__{andy, don't raise your voice. we don't wish your presence here.}
<A>__{andy is broken. he fights to bottle his rage then notices little wendy down the corridor, peering helplessly. beaten, andy waves goodbye to her. little wendy gulps, then waves goodbye too.}
