<L>__{interior bone pit night}
<A>__{ making a decidedly rough landing on a heap of bones far below. she groans, taking stock of her battered body. up above, deacon watches from the lip of the pit, amused.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{of course, a strapping young woman like yourself well i think you just might be considered finger food.}
<A>__{and with that, he's gone, stepping away from the pit.}
<L>__{interior temple of night bleeding chamber night}
<A>__{we are in a small, elevated antechamber which is situated above the main vampire sanctuary. blade, now weakened to the point of collapse, is being lashed to a rack like device by iron chains. mercury and her cohorts move efficiently, quickly securing him. when they are through, the rack is hoisted up into the air via a series of winch driven chains. with every turn of the winch crank, the chains are drawn tighter, causing blade to cry out, until at last, he is suspended in mid air, spread eagle.}
<B>__{frost}
<A>__{approaches, still carrying blade's sword.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{it's been a long road, hasn't it? such a pity whistler led you so far astray.}
<A>__{frost cocks his head to the side, studying blade's face.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{i don't blame you, though. i want you to know that. even after all you've done. i understand, blade, i really do. it's the human side of you which has corrupted your reasoning, made you weak. but we'll take care of that, won't we?}
<A>__{blade struggles to lift his head, forcing himself to match frost's gaze, shaking with hatred.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i'd kill myself before i turned into something like you.}
<A>__{frost just smiles and shakes his head.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{no you wouldn't. i'm going to bleed you dry, blade. all the poison that makes you human.}
<P>__{(drawing closer)}
<D>__{when the tide comes, you'll be begging me put you through the change.}
<A>__{frost lifts up blade's sword, methodically slitting blade's wrists one by one. he makes the cuts lengthwise, opening up the cephalic and basilic veins with surgical precision. blood wells up from the fresh wounds, running down blade's forearms, collecting in a cistern beneath his feet. frost watches the steady, inexorable process, then nods, satisfied. he looks to the others who are gathered behind him, watching on with silent reverence.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{it's done. we should ready ourselves for the ritual of invocation.}
<A>__{frost leads mercury, quinn, and the others from the sanctuary. blade struggles futilely against his bonds, crying out in frustration, his body eventually sagging from exhaustion.}
<C>__{vanessa }
<D>__{there's no use fighting us, jason.}
<A>__{blade looks up, focusing now on vanessa, who has remained behind. blade stares at her. as terrible as his physical torment is, his mother's betrayal is infinitely worse.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{how could you be a part of this?}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{these are my people now. i'm one of them.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you don't have to be.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{you don't understand. i've killed, i've hunted, and i've enjoyed it.}
<A>__{she draws closer, caressing her son's face. there's just a hint of creepy eroticism in her action, a dash of incest.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{i wish you could see the world as i do. deacon opened my eyes. there's no turning back from that.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i don't believe that.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{you will. time is on our side. sooner or later, the thirst always wins.}
<A>__{vanessa turns away now. blade cries after her }
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{mother!}
<A>__{vanessa pauses, looking back, smiling cruelly.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{your mother died the night you were born.}
<A>__{and with that, she's gone, melting into the shadows.}
