<L>__{interior morgue day}
<A>__{laurel slams into a wall on one side of the morgue, thrown there by edgar. he leans in, close, furious.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{where is the animal?!}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{i told you, i don't know, it ran under some equipment! over there.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{get it!}
<A>__{he grabs her roughly and drags her across the morgue, toward the equipment she pointed to. as they draw close, orion the cat bolts from underneath it, races between their legs, and leapfrogs over several small cabinets, landing on top of a very tall one with only six inches clearance between it and the ceiling. a very tough hiding place. edgar just starts to turn when they hear the bell and a voice from the corridor outside.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{hello? anybody here?}
<A>__{edgar looks up at the cat's hiding place. no time to get it. the bell dings again.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{roughly, edgar pulls laurel close and puts a finger to his lips "shhhhhhh."}
