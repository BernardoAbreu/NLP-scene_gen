<A>__{the report continues on a tv no one's really watching here: a march of time like history of bumpy johnson, famed harlem gangster, robin hood and killer.}
<C>__{reporter on tv}
<D>__{he was a great man, according to the eulogies. a giving man. a man of the people. no one chose to include in their remembrances the word most often associated with ellsworth bumpy johnson: gangster.}
<A>__{sitting off by himself in bumpy's elegant garden apartment, heretofore his private sanctuary, frank surveys the mourners circling the place like vultures: tango black, a huge brute, scavenging the catered food and tended bar ... jackie fox, surrounded by his ever present coterie of sycophants ... albert tosca, an elegant italian capo, and an underling, rossi, at the bar.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{white wine, please.}
<A>__{a white man who looks like a banker and is sits down next to frank.}
<C>__{banker}
<D>__{how you doing, frank?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{banker}
<D>__{what a loss.}
<P>__{(frank nods)}
<D>__{how are you otherwise? things okay financially?}
<A>__{frank doesn't say. it feels unseemly to him to be talking about money here. he watches tango carelessly set a watery glass of ice on an antique inlaid chess table.}
<C>__{banker}
<D>__{bumpy set something up for you?}
<A>__{frank excuses himself without an answer, crosses to where tango left the glass, and sets it on a coaster.}
<C>__{tango}
<D>__{hey, frank, get me an ashtray while you're at it.}
<A>__{bumpy's german shepherd watches as frank reaches into his jacket, revealing a gun nestled in its shoulder holster. he takes out a handkerchief, wipes the condensation dry, opens a drawer and removes an ashtray. he holds it out to tango who isn't sure it's not a dare and decides to wander off.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i know you're hurting, frank. so am i.}
<A>__{frank sits back down with charlie williams, an older dope man.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you going to be all right?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm sure bumpy never told you, but he made me promise, anything ever happened to him, i'd make sure you didn't go without.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i will be fine, charlie. half the people here owed bumpy money when he died. a lot of money. if they think i'm going to forget to collect, they're wrong.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's the spirit. go get them.}
<A>__{on the tv, over archive film and photographs of crime figures from the 1940's and `50's, the opinion is offered that bumpy's death "marks the end of an era ..."}
