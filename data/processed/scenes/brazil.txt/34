<A>__{of doctor's surgery. it looks a bit like a cross between an operating theatre and a boudoir. the cold steel, glass and plastic surfaces are badly disguised with pastel coloured chintz and satin. at the dressing table sits the old woman, sam's mother. behind her stands the doctor. he is much like his surgery. he has tailored his surgical garments like a gigolo's dressing gown. it seems that he has done a bit of tuck taking on himself. there is a certain plastic smoothness to his skin, but all in all he has been fairly successful. sam is pacing around, raving.}
