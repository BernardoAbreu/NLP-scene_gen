<A>__{jacob, scott, karen and gina stand around in various states of utter shock as david tries to console them.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we have to be strong.}
<A>__{he puts an arm around karen and reaches out to put the other one around gina, but pulls away at the last minute when she starts to flinch.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{we need to pull together and help each other. mrs. ross is upstairs in bed. she's pretty messed up. we need to help her deal with this.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{he would never touch a cigarette. you know that.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we don't know anything until the authorities are finished with their investigation. in the mean time, no work for tomorrow three day weekend. but monday, it's back on the job. jacob wasn't covered in our health plan and his little stint at the hospital cost us a bundle. we have to work together or we might lose this place. okay?}
<A>__{the kids all nod, but not convincingly. they care more about wesley than the house.}
