<L>__{exterior convent night}
<A>__{the moon casts shafts of silver light down to the courtyard of the convent. most of the lights in the neighborhood are out at this late hour.}
<C>__{christy's voice}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{come on... i've got a surprise...}
<L>__{interior convent kitchen night}
<A>__{the kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle carried by christy. three more candles appear, carried by mary robert, mary patrick and mary lazarus. the door to the freezer opens, and light spills out. christy removes several pints of ice cream and distributes them to the nuns.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<P>__{(delighted)}
<D>__{ice cream!}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{mary clarence you shouldn't have. where did you get this?}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{it's a sin. it's a wicked indulgence. is this butter almond?}
<A>__{christy and the nuns sit on stools, enjoying their ice cream by candlelight.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{it's contraband. don't ask. but i wanted to give you a treat. a sort of... thank you gift.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{a thank you? for what? you're the one we should be thanking.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{is there any syrup?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{well... see, at my old convent, i wasn't always... real popular. i was sort of selfish and... not real helpful. okay, i will say it i wasn't much of a nun. but now, thanks to all of you... maybe i'm shaping up.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{mary clarence, don't be silly. you're an example to us all. you've taught us so much. we're singing for the cardinals, and then who knows? maybe the choir can travel to schools, and nursing homes.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{we could cut a demo. look for a label.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(knowing she has to leave)}
<D>__{that's true, wouldn't that be great. of course, we never know when things are going to change. any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{are you leaving us?}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(sincerely)}
<D>__{oh no. we'll always be together.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{that's what diana ross said.}
<A>__{christy and the nuns qiggle, and continue eating their ice cream, in a spirit of true friendship. mother superior watches this scene, hidden in the shadows by the door to the kitchen. she has begun to see christy in a new light. she looks thoughtful, and walks off.}
