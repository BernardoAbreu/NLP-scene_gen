<A>__{two plates of food float in front of two breasts tucked inside a zippered uniform. wider disheveled and unshaven, jack and miles are served breakfast by a young, innocently sexy waitress. jack leers after her.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fuck, man. too early in the morning for that, you know what i mean?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{she's a kid, jack. i don't even look at that stuff anymore.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that's your problem, miles.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{as if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{speak for yourself. i get chicks looking at me all the time. all ages.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{it's not worth it. you pay too big a price. it's never free.}
<A>__{they eat in silence a moment.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you need to get laid.}
<A>__{miles shrugs off the comment.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it'd be the best thing for you. you know what? i'm going to get you laid this week. that's going to be my best man gift to you. i'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i'd rather have a knife.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no. no. you've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. now it's worse you're wasting away. teaching english to fucking eighth graders when they should be reading what you wrote. your books.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i'm working on it.}
<A>__{miles concentrates on his eggs and hash browns}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you still seeing that shrink?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i went on monday. but i spent most of the time helping him with his computer.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, i say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, xanax?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and lexapro, yes.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, i say fuck that. you need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{jack. this week is not about me. it's about you. i'm going to show you a good time. we're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and get your bone smooched.}
<A>__{jack spots the waitress coming out of the kitchen and motions for more coffee. she nods and smiles, indicating she'll be right over. jack returns the smile and holds up a hand to signal he'll wait. jack turns back to see miles watching him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
