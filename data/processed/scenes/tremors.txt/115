<A>__{burt and heather's truck is parked in foreground. the couple is up on the roof in background. burt prowls along the edge of the roof with the elephant gun. heather mans the c.b.}

<D>__{yeah, val.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{we're in deep shit over here. let's change that plan.}
<A>__{a hump of dirt raises near the base of the house. burt jerks the rifle to his shoulder and squeezes off a shot. the hump moves away from the house.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{knock it off, burt!}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{i think i scared it!}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{forget going for help. we'll all be dead long before you get back.}
<A>__{still moving away, the hump of dirt passes under the side walk, rippling the flagstones gently.}
<C>__{heather}
<P>__{(into cb)}
<D>__{we're here, val. just tell us what you need. come back.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{they're tearing down the houses here! we all gotta get outta here together! now!}
<A>__{the hump of dirt passes under burt and heather's truck, rocking the vehicle slightly.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{we're with you, val. we'll come get everybody. just hang on tight.}
<A>__{the truck's security alarm starts booping! burt and heather stare down helplessly as the noisy truck is furiously attacked by the frenzied creatures. dust flies as metal rips and tires shred.}
