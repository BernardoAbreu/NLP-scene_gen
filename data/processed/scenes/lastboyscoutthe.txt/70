<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{joe hallenbeck's unconscious face weathered. sallow. dark circles under the eyes.}
<B>__{hand}
<A>__{comes into frame and slaps him. hard. rocks his head to one side.}
<L>__{interior elegant beach house living room another angle}
<A>__{thick carpet. polished, wood furniture. window walls. outside, the sea is angry and grey.}
<B>__{pablo and chet}
<A>__{are standing over hallenbeck, who is slumped in a chair. both hitmen wear holstered sidearms. chet leans over and slaps hallenbeck again. the big detective begins to stir. his eyelids flutter.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i think he's awake.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{make sure.}
<A>__{chet's hand flashes out for a third slap and from nowhere, joe hallenbeck's hand magically appears. intercepts the blow. clamps onto chet's hand and wrenches it. a cry of pain. chet stumbles backward, cradling the wrist.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i'm awake.}
<A>__{his eyelids creak open. he squints, adjusting to the light. studies his captors.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{you nearly broke my wrist, man.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{life's a bitch.}
<A>__{he starts pawing his coat pockets, looking for a cigarette. in the corner, pablo chuckles:}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{milo warned us to watch out for this guy.}
<A>__{chet is seething. he glares at hallenbeck. hallenbeck yawns.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{fuck that. look at him. he's nothin'. guy's a piece of shit.}
<A>__{hallenbeck ignores him. sits up. rubs tired eyes.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{anybody got a cigarette...?}
<A>__{chet steps forward. grins wickedly.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{sure, buddy. i got a cigarette.}
<A>__{he reaches into his shirt pocket. extracts a marlboro. hands it to hallenbeck. takes out a lighter. hallenbeck places the cigarette between his lips. leans forward for a light and chet slugs him in the face. the cigarette goes flying. hallenbeck's head snaps back. blood creeps from his lower lip.}
<C>__{chet}
<P>__{(guffaws)}
<D>__{hey, baby, i thought you were tough. see, pablo, he ain't so bad.}
<A>__{hallenbeck's eyes glint fiercely. he takes a breath. leans forward and says:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i seem to have dropped my cigarette. may i have another?}
<A>__{chet turns, meets his gaze. the grin falters a bit.}
<C>__{chet}
<P>__{(unnerved)}
<D>__{sure. sure thing, buddy.}
<A>__{he hands hallenbeck another smoke. hallenbeck puts it between his lips.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i need a light.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and if you touch me again... i will kill you.}
<A>__{a pregnant pause. the challenge hangs in the air. slowly, chet takes the lighter from his pocket. pablo looks on, a smile twisting his features. hallenbeck leans forward for a light. chet extends his arm and slugs hallenbeck in the face again. rocks him. chet howls with laughter. pablo grins.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{baby! two for two!}
<A>__{the laughter continues. hallenbeck takes a deep breath. stands up. strikes with a flattened palm. breaks chet's nose. drives it up into the brain. chet stands, pole axed. blinks once. pitches over dead. and suddenly pablo isn't laughing. he stares at hallenbeck, incredulous. stares at chet, lying on the carpet.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<P>__{(draws his gun)}
<D>__{you son of a bitch. jesus christ!!}
<A>__{he rushes to chet. kneels beside him. hallenbeck calmly returns to his seat.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{you killed him! 'fuckin' a, you killed him, he's fuckin' dead!!!}
<A>__{hallenbeck says nothing. at that moment, a door opens, and milo enters. slick. well dressed. utterly composed.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{is there a problem?}
<C>__{pablo}
<P>__{(still dazed)}
<D>__{he killed chet, milo. the mother fucker just killed him!}
<A>__{milo looks toward hallenbeck. hallenbeck says nothing. instead, he calmly leans forward and picks up chet's lighter from the carpet. lights his cigarette. blows smoke. a tense moment... and then milo does something un expected: he starts to laugh. advances into the room, chuckling.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{oh, my. oh, goddamn. joseph, joseph, you don't disappoint me.}
<A>__{he draws a walther ppk and approaches hallenbeck. smiling and cheerful.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you seem to have killed one of my men.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i needed a light.}
<A>__{milo nods as if this makes perfect sense.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you took an awful risk. pablo here could have shot you dead.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{if you wanted me dead, you'd have already killed me.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{yes, that's true.}
<P>__{(sits down)}
<D>__{i suppose introductions are in order.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(waves his hand)}
<D>__{fuck it. you're the bad guy, right?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{yes. i'm the bad guy.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{and you've got the gun, and i'm supposed to tremble in fear, something like that?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{fine. i will start trembling in a minute. mind if i have a drink first?}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i don't see why not. pablo, please take chet's corpse into the other room, and then fix mr. hallenbeck a drink.}
<A>__{suddenly a voice rings out from the doorway:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{make that two.}
<A>__{hallenbeck turns toward the new arrival.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{hey, look who's here. connie marcon himself.}
<A>__{sure enough, conrad marcon saunters in, just like he owns the place. which, by the way, he does. tall, strong, texas tough. dressed in a saville row suit. he frowns at hallenbeck:}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{careful, son. only my friends call me connie.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you got friends? when did this happen?}
<C>__{marcon}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{i will give you one thing. you're pretty calm for a man in your position.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you're pretty calm for a man whose team is three and six on the year.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{they're having some problems.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{they stink.}
<A>__{marcon's composure falters, but only for a moment.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{i'm glad you're here, joe. we got a few things to discuss.}
<A>__{he takes a moment to gather his thoughts.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{for starters, i'm sure you're aware that professional football is changing, and not for better.}
<P>__{(lights a cigar)}
<D>__{used to be, you went to the local stadium come sunday, you saw heroes. guys who fought for their hometown. anymore, no one gives a shit. ever since sonny werblin paid $400,000 to joe namath back in '66, the sons of bitches just got greedier. playing only for themselves. giving nothing back to the game.}
<A>__{pablo hands him a double bourbon.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{this year, the final blow: the n.f.l. votes to decertify the players organization. eliminates the draft, reduces all athletes to free agents. reduces football, once and for all, to commerce. to greed, you follow?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{when do i say the pledge of allegiance?}
<A>__{marcon looks directly at hallenbeck.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{do you know how many ratings points monday night football lost this year? per week? an average of two point eight.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{oh, for chrissake. you're telling me this whole thing is about tv ratings?}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{people have stopped watching, joe! everybody's turning the channel, they're still looking for heroes, you follow? guys like you. milo here tells me you took a bullet for the president, jumped in front of a sniper rifle.}
<A>__{hallenbeck reacts, startled. looks at milo.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{we took the liberty of researching your background.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{how about it, joe? is it truth or hype?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i got the rifle in my closet as a souvenir.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{there you go, that's what i'm saying. the public wants real heroes. not a bunch of football prima donnas, jumping from team to team with their fancy lawyers.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{in fact, joe, and this is my point, there's only one reason left nowadays to watch pro football. can you guess?}
<A>__{it begins to dawn on hallenbeck.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{gambling.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{exactly. gambling.}
<P>__{(puffs his cigar)}
<D>__{just one problem: football gambling is illegal in all but two of the fifty states. and that, joe boy, is where i come in.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(sudden realization)}
<D>__{shit, that's what this is about! you're bribing united states senators. paying them to pass legislation }
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{ legalizing football gambling in all fifty states. exactly.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{attendance goes up again. tv ratings go up again.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{you got it, son. the networks are happy. i'm happy. everybody's happy.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{before we get too fucking happy, let's get a couple things straight: first, i'm not your fucking son, and second... why am i still alive?}
<A>__{marcon stops pacing. sighs and sits down facing hallenbeck.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{it's like this, joe: everything was going great until a couple weeks ago, and then i hit a snag: senator calvin baynard.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(takes a sip of bourbon)}
<D>__{i don't get it. what's the snag?}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{i offered him the bribe and he wouldn't take it.}
<A>__{hallenbeck actually does a spit take. sprays bourbon.}
<C>__{hallebeck}
<D>__{baynard? are you nuts? the guy's so crooked he shits slinkies.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{allow me to clarify: i offered him the bribe, and he turned it down because he wanted more money.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(sighs with relief)}
<D>__{thank god. for a minute there i felt hell freezing over. did he ask for more than a million?}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{does the pope shit in the woods? he wants two million or he'll blow the lid off my whole plan. i don't feel like paying no two mil, so basically that good ole' boy's gotta die.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{taking off a u.s. senator, that's pretty ballsy. even for an asshole like you.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{oh, i'm not going to kill baynard, joe.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{who is?}
<A>__{marcon says nothing. just looks at hallenbeck and smiles.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<A>__{he rubs tired eyes.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i'm the perfect fall guy. everyone and his uncle max knows i hate baynard.}
<C>__{marcon}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{anything goes wrong, all the heat lands on you, joe boy. my hands are clean.}
<A>__{hallenbeck scowls.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{any particular reason i should go along with this prize winning scheme?}
<C>__{marcon}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{just one.}
<A>__{he motions to milo, who disappears through a doorway. reappears a moment later. he's got joe's wife.}
<B>__{angle on hallenbeck}
<A>__{he stands. face contorting. fists clenched. rage courses through him like an electric current. marcon cocks his gun.}
<C>__{marcon}
<D>__{sit down, joe.}
<A>__{a moment. joe stands, smouldering. on fire. sarah speaks:}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{do what he says, joe.}
<A>__{joe sits. breathing shallowly. eyes locked on milo.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{are you alright, sarah?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{that's a temporary condition, joseph. as you may be aware, there are distributors in mexico who positively crave snuff films. and unless you do every fucking thing mr. marcon tells you... your wife will make her motion picture debut.}
<A>__{he meets joe's murderous gaze... and smiles.}
