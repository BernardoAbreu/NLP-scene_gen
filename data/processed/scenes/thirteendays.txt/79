<A>__{the president. he listens, looks over the briefing papers as mcnamara continues. everyone watches the president.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{a quarantine prevents more missiles from reaching cuba, but it doesn't remove the ones already there. it gives the soviets a chance to pull back without war. if they refuse to remove the missiles before they're operational, we retain the option to strike or invade.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{we believe that a surprise attack would be counter to what the united states stands for. we believe that an attack leaves us no room for maneuver, and the inevitable soviet response will force us into a war we do not want. a war that, this time, will really end all war.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{mr. president, there are still those of us who believe we should proceed with the strikes. with the blockade, we lose strategic surprise and we run the risk of a first strike if the soviets decide they have to use the missiles or lose them.}
<A>__{the president gazes from one expectant face to another. but he himself remains unreadable.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{quarantine or air strike.}
<A>__{adlai clears his throat. everyone looks over at him. he stares down at his clasped hands for a beat. he's anguished about what he's going to say.}
<C>__{adlai}
<D>__{there is a third option. with either course we undertake the risk of nuclear war. it seems to me maybe one of us in here should be a coward.}
<A>__{he smiles weakly, but gets no response from anyone.}
<C>__{adlai }
<D>__{so i guess i will be. our third choice is to cut a deal. we trade guantanamo and our missiles in turkey, get them to pull their missiles out. we employ a back channel, attribute the idea to u thant. u thant then raises it at the u.n.}
<A>__{adlai looks for support around the room, but meets only stony gazes. from mccone and general taylor, contempt. dead silence for a long, long beat. kenny's heart goes out to stevenson as he watches the man commit political suicide. even sorensen, standing behind him, unconsciously moves away. at last the president speaks.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{i don't think that's possible, adlai.}
<P>__{(beat, to the room)}
<D>__{i will be asking the networks for air time monday night. i have not yet made my final decision. we will announce our course of action then. i want to thank you all for your advice, gentlemen.}
