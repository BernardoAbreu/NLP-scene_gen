<A>__{venkman is waiting in front of the building as ecto 2 pulls up and stantz, spengler and winston get out and report on dana's apartment.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{did you find anything at dana's?}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{nothing. just some mood slime residue in and around the bathtub. but we did turn up some interesting stuff on this vigo character you mentioned. i found the name vigo the carpathian in leon zundinger's magicians, martyrs and madmen. listen to this:}
<C>__{spengler}
<P>__{(reads from xerox of entry)}
<D>__{"vigo the carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 "}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{a hundred and five years? he really hung on, didn't he.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{and he didn't die of old age either. he was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{i guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{no, not exactly a man of the people.}
<P>__{(reads)}
<D>__{"also known as vigo the cruel, vigo the torturer, vigo the despised, and vigo the unholy."}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{this guy was a bad monkey. he dabbled in all the black arts, and listen to this prophecy. just before his head died, his last words were, "death is but a door, time is but a window. i will be back."}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{that's it? "i will be back?"}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{it's a rough translation from the moldavian.}
<A>__{they enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment.}
