<L>__{exterior lochnager day}
<A>__{the next day. high over the vast, bleak mountains of lochnager and loch muick. victoria and brown are riding fast towards the top. reaching the summit, victoria points excitedly at the far horizon.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{what are those?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{those, over there, there.}
<C>__{brown}

<C>__{victoria}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{craobhan geanmchno...}
<P>__{(bursts out laughing)}
<D>__{how can i possibly say that with a straight face?!}
<A>__{brown lets it go and they ride on.}
<C>__{victoria }
<D>__{i am thinking of publishing my "highland journals."}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{are they worth reading?}
<C>__{victoria}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i am told so.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{who by?}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{what does he know about the highlands?}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{he has been attending at balmoral for many years.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{that doesn't make him an expert.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{his remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, i groom it because it needs grooming.}
<C>__{victoria}
<P>__{(curtly)}
<D>__{i do not do it for others. but ponsonby thinks they are good.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{just say what you have to say, woman. what other people think shouldn't matter to you.}
<C>__{victoria}
<P>__{(snapping)}
<D>__{of course i shall say what i have to say. i always do.}
<A>__{the stare at each other until brown kicks his horse on.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.}
<C>__{victoria}
<P>__{(riding alongside)}
<D>__{what mr ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{literary appreciation does not begin and end with tennyson.}
<A>__{brown lowers his head.}
<C>__{victoria }
<P>__{(in a softer tone)}
<D>__{i mention you in them.}
<A>__{brown says nothing.}
<C>__{victoria }
<D>__{in particular, the occasion when albert was alive; the royal carriage overturned during a storm and you demonstrated such loyal service in returning the queen and the princesses safely to balmoral.}
<A>__{taking a sprig of heather from her brooch, victoria holds it out to him. a beat.}
<C>__{victoria }
<D>__{for friendship.}
