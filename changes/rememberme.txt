<LOC>__{EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- BROOKLYN -- NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{It's very late. It's quiet. Just the sounds of The City LINDA SANTANA CRAIG, an attractive Hispanic woman in her thirties, waits at the ELEVATED STATION for the F train. Linda looks great. She's dressed festively but tastefully. Next to her is her eleven year old DAUGHTER, ALICIA. She is twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday party they attended in The City. Alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink handbag. We notice a CHARM BRACELET with four-leaf clovers on her right wrist. The mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station platform. TWO TEENAGE BOYS wait at the other end. They speak soft, SLURRED SPANISH to each other. Linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. She watches them as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand. The Boys approach. Linda tenses. At the last second the boys make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell. It's quiet again. Linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter. The F TRAIN is rounding the final bend into the station. Their focus is on this train. It's getting closer, louder. And so they don't see, don't hear the Boys coming back up the stairwell behind them. Not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his gun. Linda puts her arm around her daughter. Alicia looks terrified. The train roars INTO THE STATION as Linda quickly hands over her purse, her watch. She hands over her engagement ring and her wedding band. One of the boys yanks Alicia's little purse away from her. The other boy fumbles the wedding band. The ring CLANGS to the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away. We hear MEN'S VOICES echoing up the stairwell. Now the Boys are boxed in. And starting to panic. -- THE TRAIN DOORS SLIDE OPEN --. The Boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail car, leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform. Through the window on the train, Linda stares at the boy holding her daughter's purse, her face hardening into a MASK}

<ACTION>__{The boy clocks it. Who does she think she is? -- THE TRAIN DOORS BEGIN TO CLOSE -- When a HAND WITH TATTOOED KNUCKLES reaches out and stops the car doors from closing. A forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car ... There's a muzzle flash... a distant POP... a cloud of smoke ... a mist of blood... and Linda's body collapses on itself. Alicia's face, shock, terror and blood.}

<ACTION>__{A WORKING CRIME SCENE, lots of uniforms and light, a white sheet draped over Linda's body where it fell. BLUE AND RED LIGHT dances against the stairwell wall where a man is taking the stairs two at a time. Late thirties, big, plain clothes, he is SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG. When he reaches the platform, he stops. Craig kneels before the white sheet. Peels it back. We stay on him. We don't see what he sees. We just see how he sees it. Then he turns... THE WEDDING BAND. It's been tagged and numbered as evidence. Craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it into his pocket. Alicia, wrapped in a blanket, standing next to a round police MATRON. The Matron is tenderly trying to clean Alicia's face. Alicia locks eyes with Craig and stumbles towards him, her legs not quite working. Craig saves her from the stumble and envelops her, lifting her as the blanket falls to the ground. Alicia makes little gasping noises. Trying to speak but can't. Craig walking back now, carrying his entire world. He reaches the stairwell and suddenly falls to one knee. Alicia gasps. The closest UNIFORM puts a hand on his arm. A moment. Composure. A deep breath. Then as quickly as he went down, he's back up. Craig looks back now, taking it all in. Is it real? Sees all the cops looking at him, then begins down the stairs. WE DRIFT UP above the station until we find ourselves with a clear view of the southern tip of Manhattan, where the TWIN}

<ACTION>__{SUBTITLE: "Eight Years Later" Tiny kitchen, clutter, a MESSENGER BIKE hanging from hooks on the wall, a lot of books. There is a PHONE RINGING under the bed. TYLER ROTH, early twenties, handsome, looking haggard. He is sitting on the floor, shirtless, bed head, wrapped in a blanket. A GUITAR is on his lap. Tyler has propped some well worn, hand written pages of MUSIC against a box of off-brand laundry detergent and is squinting at the notes, frustration etched in his face. A forgettable BLONDE lies sleeping on the bed. Tyler, not a born musician, is trying to teach himself one of the PHRASES OF MUSIC in front of him. He is completely lost in the moment, with DEEP GROOVES in his fingers. By the ASHTRAY next to him, we can tell he's been at this a couple of hours. The Blonde in the bed re: the ringing phone...}

A beat up GYPSY CAB with a WEST INDIAN DRIVER pulls to a stop. From the trees and the sky we know its LATE SPRING/EARLY SUMMER. A gorgeous day. Tyler gets out of the cab, holding the rim of his empty coffee cup in his teeth. He sorts a rumpled wad of singles and hands some to the driver, who screeches into reverse. Time is money. Tyler crushes the coffee cup flat and slips it in his jacket pocket then lights up a smoke. He takes one long drag then extinguishes it and slips the butt into his pocket. He begins towards the mourners. His mother... DIANE HOFFMAN, a beauty. Past burdens etched in the lines on her face. Dressed tastefully in expensive bohemian.
