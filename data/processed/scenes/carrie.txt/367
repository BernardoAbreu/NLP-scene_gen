<A>__{carrie goes to the head of the stairs. once again, she mouths the words:}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{momma...}
<A>__{something a movement? an instinct? makes her turn. she sees:}
<L>__{328 margaret}
<A>__{coming toward her.}
<L>__{329 carrie}
<A>__{she flings out her arms and cries out:}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{oh, momma!}
<A>__{and throws herself against her mother, holds her. a movement from margaret, a quick movement, hard to define. and carrie recoils, her hands clutching her stomach. briefly we see the knife in margaret's hand. then carrie tumbles down the stairs.}
<L>__{330 angle down stairs}
<A>__{on carrie, lying like a broken doll, huddled at the foot of the stairs.}
