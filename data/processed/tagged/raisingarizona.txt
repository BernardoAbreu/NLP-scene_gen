<B>__{dark field same night}
<A>__{the rolling thunder has built to a thunderclap at the cut, and the flash of the polaroid match cuts to lightning throwing a momentarily harsh glare on the field. rain beats down on the bare patch of ground we are looking at by now just a patch of mud. faraway lightning flickers and we hear the rumble of more thunder approaching, then suddenly: thwack a head pops up out of the mud. it is gale, the con we saw in group therapy. he bellows as lightning and thunder flash and crack nearby. his head is covered with mud, although the driving rain is already starting to wash it away. we are beginning to track in an arc around gale's head, who is now struggling, working to get his shoulders and arms up out of the mud. the end of the 180 degree arc and a flash of lightning reveal, way in the distance, the wire topped walls of a penitentiary. still bellowing, as if in some primal rage, gale has gotten his muck covered arms up out of the earth and is now pushing down to haul up the rest of his body. it comes with much effort, and with the loud sucking popping sounds of the fiercely clinging mud. finally he is free. with a great cry, the mud covered man plunges his right arm straight back down into the earth, all the way up to his shoulder. he gropes intently and then, apparently having grabbed hold of something underground, he starts pulling. his arm comes slowly back up out of the mud. clasped in his hand is a human foot. bellowing with effort he continues to pull, liberating the foot... leg... torso of his companion, and finally his head. as the rain starts to wash the mud off his companion's head we see that it is his friend evelle. both are bellowing. mud sucks and pops. thunder crashes.}

<D>__{well ma'am, i don't know much but i do know human bein's. you brought back my boy so you must have your good points too. i'd sure hate to think of florence leavin' me i do love her so...}
<A>__{he clears his throat and turns to the door. his tone is harder again:}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...you can go out the way you came in...}
<A>__{he snaps off the lights.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...and before you go off and do another foolish thing, like busting up, i suggest you sleep on it...}
<A>__{he has disappeared into the hall. we hear his voice receding:}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...at least one night.}
<B>__{high shot}
<A>__{looking straight down at hi, asleep in the trailer bedroom. we start to crane down.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{that night i had a dream...}
<L>__{extreme wide shot}
<A>__{a beautiful dusk landscape. we are floating in over the field, abutting the prison, that gale and evelle popped out of. in the middle background of the extreme long shot two men are walking across the field.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...i dreamt i was as light as the ether, a floating spirit visiting things to come...}
<B>__{back to high shot bedroom}
<A>__{craning down toward hi.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{the shades and shadows of the people in my life wrastled their way into my slumber.}
<B>__{back to field}
<A>__{still floating forward but now much closer to the two walking men. we see that they are gale and evelle. both are still dyed blue. they are approaching the hole in the ground.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{i dreamt that gale and evelle had decided to return to prison...}
<A>__{evelle is starting to climb into the hole.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...probably that's just as well. i don't mean to sound superior, and they're a swell couple guys, but...}
<A>__{evelle has disappeared and gale starts climbing in.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...maybe they weren't ready yet to come out into the world.}
<B>__{floating up the walk of the arizona hone}
<A>__{the front door has a holly wreath on it.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{and then i dreamed on, into the future, to a christmas morn in the arizona home...}
<T>__{dissolve through to:}
<B>__{arizona living room}
<A>__{five three year olds in their pajamas are opening presents around a tree as nathan and florence look on.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...where nathan jr. was opening a present from a kindly couple who preferred to remain unknown.}
<A>__{we have been isolating in on one of the children peeling the wrappings off a package marked to nathan jr. inside is a shiny red plastic football.}
<B>__{floating in toward a station wagon}
<A>__{pulled over on the state highway in the middle of the desert, a police motorcycle parked behind it. glen is leaning out the driver's window of the car talking to the state trooper who stands facing him.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{i saw glen, a few years later, still havin' no luck gettin' the cops to listen to his wild tales about me'n ed...}
<A>__{glen is grinning and talking with his hands cupped in front of him, as when he told hi about the pollack who almost stepped in the pile of shit. the trooper, in crash helmet and dark sunglasses, is listening tight lipped and stone faced as glen finishes his story and slaps his knee.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...maybe he threw in one pollack joke too many...}
<A>__{the trooper is clicking open his ballpoint pen and reaching his citation book from his breast pocket. the name tag on the pocket says "sgt. kowalski."}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...i don't know.}
<B>__{floating in toward a football}
<A>__{it sits on a tee in the middle of a football field.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{and still i dreamed on...}
<A>__{a cleated foot boots the football out of frame.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...further into the future than i'd ever dreamed before.}
<B>__{high school football player}
<A>__{looking up, arms out at his sides, waiting to receive the kicked ball.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...watching nathan jr.'s progress from afar...}
<A>__{he catches the ball and starts running.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...taking pride in his accomplishments as if he were our own...}
<A>__{he is skillfully eluding and stiff arming tacklers.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...wondering if he ever thought of us.}
<A>__{he reaches the end zone and triumphantly spikes the football. he whips off his helmet and we track in on the face of the rosy cheeked high school bruiser.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...and hoping that maybe we'd broadened his horizons a little, even if he couldn't remember just how they'd got broadened.}
<B>__{back to bedroom}
<A>__{still craning down, now very close to the sleeping hi.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{but still i hadn't dreamt nothin' about me'n ed. until the end...}
<T>__{dissolve through to:}
<B>__{a couple}
<A>__{the man and woman are sitting on a sofa in the foreground with their backs to the camera. they are in the living room of hi and ed's trailer, which is suffused with a warm golden light. as they face the trailer's front door, all we see of the couple is the backs of their heads. they both have white hair, the woman's pulled into a bun. the old man wears a cardigan, the woman a shawl.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...and this was cloudier 'cause it was years, years away.}
<A>__{the front door bursts open. two young couples are entering as their kids about a dozen of them stream in around them. the old couple on the couch raise their arms to embrace their visitors. the children boil onto the couch.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...but i saw an old couple bein' visited by their children and all their grandchildren too. and the old couple wasn't screwed up, and neither were their kids or their grandkids. and i don't know, you tell me. this whole dream, was it wishful thinking? was i just fleein' reality, like i know i'm liable to do?}
<B>__{floating in toward a long dining table}
<A>__{in the trailer. the table is all laid out with a thanksgiving dinner, a huge turkey sitting at the far end. cut out letters at the other end of the room say: "welcome home kids!" the grandchildren are running into frame and taking their seats at the table, accompanied by their parents.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...but me'n ed, we can be good too...}
<A>__{the elderly couple enter from either side of the camera and stand in the foreground, backs to us, facing the table.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...and it seemed real. it seemed like us. and it seemed like well... our home... if not arizona, then a land, not too far away, where all parents are strong and wise and capable, and all children are happy and beloved... i dunno, maybe it was utah.}
<A>__{the elderly man drapes an arm around his wife's shoulder and draws her close. she rests her head against his shoulder, and we:}
<T>__{fade out:}
<B>__{the end}
