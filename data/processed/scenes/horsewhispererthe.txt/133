<L>__{interior creek house day}
<A>__{a tense annie is having a difficult phone with david gottschalk;}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{... david, we've been behind a day or two before. but lucy just fedexed me all the material and it'll be approved by the end of the day.}
<C>__{david gottschall }
<D>__{if nothing goes wrong. if the faxes don't go down. if the phone lines are opened. i can't have this magazine hitting the streets by the skin of its ass, annie.}
<A>__{during david's lines, diane has entered, carrying fresh towels she crosses into the bathroom.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, come on! this is such bullshit! the work is getting done, david. lucky keeps me on top of everything.}
<C>__{david gottschalk }
<D>__{lucy isn't you. we're losing something without you being here. now, i know this is a rough time for you, but i think we should make another arrangement.}
<A>__{without annie's awareness, diane re enters and takes her time leaving, so she can take in all of annie's things; her business "office," books, etc...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{what the hell does that mean? how much more do i have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?}
<C>__{david gottschalk }
<D>__{if this magazine is so important to you annie, why are you in montana?}
<A>__{diane can't help but notice a slight vulnerability in annie.}
<C>__{david gottschalk }
<D>__{look, this is what we're going to do. finish up this issue. i will set up a conference call in a few weeks. just you, me and your lawyer and we'll just work this out so that everyone will be taken care of. fair enough?}
<A>__{annie is now aware of diane's presence and chooses to play it cool. it's not the moment.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{uh, yes... sure, david.}
<C>__{david gottschalk }
<D>__{all right. speak to you then.}
<A>__{he hangs up. annie forces a smile to diane.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{thank you. you're all doing too much.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{oh, it's... i wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, i could take grace to her therapy exercises for you. i have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.}
<A>__{annie doesn't know whether or not to accept.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh... well... thank you very much. i don't }
<A>__{before she finishes her line, the phone rings again.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{sorry.}
<P>__{(to phone)}
<D>__{hello? hi, yeah, i just spoke to him. oh, you know david, mr. strong arm...}
<A>__{diane feels out of place and exits. annie doesn't notice until she hears the door close. she pushes back her hair and takes a deep breath. she looks out through the side window and sees: grace and joe doing chores. grace looks involved and not at all self conscious. a moment of gratitude and calm for annie.}
