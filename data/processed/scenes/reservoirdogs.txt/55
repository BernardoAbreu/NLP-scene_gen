<D>__{"hi, i'm from ladora heights, it's the black beverly hills."}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{it's not the black beverly hills, it's the black palos verdes. anyway, this chick, elois, was a man eater upper. i bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. you know who she looked like? christie love. 'member that tv show "get christie love"? she was a black female cop. she always used to say "you're under arrest, sugar."}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{i was in the sixth grade when that show was on. i totally dug it. what the fuck was the name of the chick who played christie love?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{pam grier.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{no, it wasn't pan grier, pan grier was the other one. pan grier made the movies. christie love was like a pam grier tv show, without pam grier.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{what the fuck was that chick's name? oh this is just great, i'm totally fuckin tortured now.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{well, whoever she was, elois looked like her. so one night i walk into the club, and no elois. now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was carlos. so i asked him "hey, carlos, where's lady e tonight?" well apparently lady e was married to this real piece of dog shit. i mean a real animal. and apparently he would so things to her.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{do things? what would he do? you mean like beat her up?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{nobody knows for sure what he did. we just know he did something. anyway, elois plays it real cool. and waits for the next time this bag of shit gets drunk. so one night the guy gets drunk and passes out on the couch. so while the guy's inebriated, she strips him naked. then she takes some crazy glue and glues his dick to his belly.}
<A>__{the car reacts to how horrible that would be.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i'm dead fuckin serious. she put some on his dick and some on his belly, then stuck 'em together. the paramedics had to come and cut it loose.}
<A>__{the car reacts badly.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{you can do some crazy things with it.}
<C>__{eddie}

<C>__{mr. white}
