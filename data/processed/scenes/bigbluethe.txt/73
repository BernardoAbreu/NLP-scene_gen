<A>__{it's a large float, rigged to the stern of the committee boat. roberto and an assistant help enzo down the swim ladder to the platform. he's wearing a wet suit and fins. he flip flops to the end of the platform. roberto hands him his mask. the goggles are filled with polystyrene to eliminate as much air pressure as possible. only two pinholes to see through. the mask fits tightly over his nose. when enzo puts it on, he looks like an astonished insect. enzo breathes faster and faster. roberto holds the wire controlling the weighted diving apparatus. enzo crosses himself, takes a last long gulp of air. roberto releases the weight. it sinks and drags enzo down, he quickly disappears into the dark water...}

<A>__{but this is jacques as he was a child. he swims along the bottom, finds and picks up a gold coin. we can see its ancient markings, a youth on a dolphin. jacques looks up. in front of him is a dolphin, floating vertically, still, apparently just watching. jacques isn't scared anymore. but every time he swims toward the dolphin, it moves further away. it finally disappears.}
