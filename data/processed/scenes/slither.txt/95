<A>__{the posse come up out of the creek. they've completely lost track of the diseased man beast. they stop, out of breath and looking around. they whisper:}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{where'd he go?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{we ain't never gonna find that girl now.}
<A>__{the redneck is weeping with rage.}
<C>__{redneck}
<D>__{i will kill that asshole what he did to charlie.}
<A>__{bill sees starla run up behind them. he waves her back.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{starla, get the hell out of here!}

<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{bill!!}
