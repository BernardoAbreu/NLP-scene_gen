<L>__{interior andrea's room continuous}
<A>__{evan is startled to see andrea hooked up to several iv's, an oxygen tank and a respirator. several oxygen hoses connect to a tracheotomy tube. tommy smiles and kisses andrea on the cheek. she tousles his hair in return. evan can hardly speak. as tommy begins to wheel evan's chair closer to andrea's bedside, andrea utters a faint whisper.}

<C>__{evan}
<D>__{right... you started chain smoking after i blew myself up.}
<A>__{evan suddenly seems sick with guilt.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{there must be a way to fix this.}

<D>__{don't worry. i'm gonna get you out of here.}
