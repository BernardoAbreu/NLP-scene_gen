<L>__{interior emily's room night}
<A>__{stormy night. heavy rain. high winds. the trees, thrashing outside the window, backlit by a streetlight, cast ominous shadows on the walls of the bedroom. emily huddles in the corner, wrapped in a blanket, clutching the screwdriver. there is a knock on the bedroom door. emily's eyes jerk wide open. she looks at the door, but doesn't answer. after a moment, lucy's voice, innocent, afraid }
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{emily...? can i come in? i'm scared...}
<A>__{emily says nothing. heart racing. there's another knock. a little louder.}
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{emily? please? i know you're in there, please...?}
<A>__{emily says nothing. lucy starts pounding on the door.}
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{please, emily...}
<B>__{silence.}
<A>__{emily listening, barely breathing. is that it? is she gone? and then suddenly wham! wham! wham! the pounding turns violent, practically shaking the door off its hinges. far too violent for a little girl. emily wedges herself into the corner, absolutely petrified. there is something very strong and very angry on the other side of that door, shrieking in the voice of a child }
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{let me in!}
<A>__{wham wham wham wham wham wham!}
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{let me in!}
<A>__{wham wham wham wham wham wham! the door getting absolutely pummeled, looking like it might splinter from the force. and it's so intense that it's almost surreal what emily is seeing. lucy's voice eerily monotone, the words coming inhumanly fast like some auctioneer from hell }
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in...}
<A>__{relentless. tormenting emily. until she can't take it anymore. and she screams as loud as she can, half cursing, half begging, the veins standing out in her neck }
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{leave me alone!!!}
<A>__{and the pounding stops dead. all we hear is the rain drumming on the roof. and emily's quick terrified breaths as she stares at the door wondering what's nexterior but there's nothing. just the shadows dancing on the walls. it appears the nightmare is over for now. but not quite. a sudden clunk in the closet makes her jump. her head snaps around what was that? she just stares, unable to breathe because whatever she just heard is inside her room! white knuckled grip on that screwdriver, emily stands up and comes slowly over to the closet door. raises the screwdriver. ready to stab. takes hold of the door handle. slowly turns it. opens the door. pitch black inside. a tense pause as she stares into that blackness, then reaches a hand into the closet, feeling around for the pull string. finds it. gives it a tug. and there, right in front of her, is a vision of unspeakable horror:}

<A>__{twitching spasmodically in a hospital gown. hideously}
<B>__{burned.}
<A>__{she comes at emily arms flailing, clumsy with rage and dementia. emily leaps aside and margaret goes careening into the furniture, howling and spinning like some crazed whirling dervish. emily scrambles over the bed. reaches the door. fumbles at the deadbolt. here comes margaret. at the last second emily gets the door open. runs out.}
