<L>__{interior room limbo}
<A>__{jim peering into a room somewhere one of warhol's films is playing on a wall a man sleeping, eating... a glimpse of vietnam war footage on a tv monitor b 52s dropping bombs. a fat little pr man grabbing jim's arm, leaning in, distorted.}
<C>__{pr man}
<P>__{(cool)}
<D>__{you must meet andy warhol, jim. he's more than an artist. andy is art. bright people in america wonder does andy imitate life, or does life imitate andy. the meeting of two kings. yes, come.}
<A>__{pamela is suddenly there, laughing, nuttily introducing a handsome strapping tom baker, a charismatic actor, and a count, suave, urbane, on heroin. her voice lost in the jabber their names sound as if they're in a bottom of a tank. pamela seems so impressed with the high life of new york.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{oh jim this is tom... baker, he's an actor, he was in andy's movie and this is count ruspoli. he lives in paris, but he's italian. he's from a very famous family over there. they're seven hundred years old.}
<C>__{count}
<P>__{(italian accent)}
<D>__{hi jim, you are great... i see you at ondine's with bobby and jimmy. it...}
<A>__{pr guy stays there, introduces himself to the count.}
<C>__{pam}
<P>__{(pawing at jim)}

<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(annoyed with pam)}

<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(cutting in)}
<D>__{saw your gig at 'the scene'. hot... very hot... you strung out? here. try this.}
<P>__{(pill, popper, joint, a drink, all at once)}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{love your movies man. what a great penis...}
<A>__{tom is obviously a major druggie. a popper joint trade off going off. ray's face leaning in distorted.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{come on, we're splitting man. dorothy's waiting at the door. we'll get a bite at max's and...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you can't leave. where's your will to be weird man?}
<A>__{john densmore appearing with a wasted looking robbie who is giggling, high, and with a new girlfriend in tow.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{get outta here man. this is fucking weird man.}
<A>__{the pr man is still next to jim, jumping up and down excitedly waving across the room at nothing in particular. as the photographers try to get jim and the doors in a photo opportunity.}
<C>__{pr man}
<D>__{right this way jim. andy's in the bedroom.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(to ray)}
<D>__{don't go, y'see norman mailer, i hear he's here?}

<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(paranoid)}
<D>__{i don't know... did he know who you were?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah sure, he's cool, come on, he's your hero!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{nah... later...}
<A>__{a wasted, emaciated edie sedgewick type floats into jim's fractured pov introducing a man with a crew cut and silk suit.}
<C>__{edie}
<P>__{(echoey voice)}
<D>__{hey jim, this is jake johnson, you remember jake johnson the astronaut, he's just got back from outer space.}
<C>__{jake johnson}
<D>__{i like the doors, i like the doors, i like the doors.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i like outer space.}
<A>__{tom baker brings a tall, incredible looking blonde in black leather towards him.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hey where's my joint?}
<P>__{(a roach goes back)}
<D>__{there's this chick sings with the velvet underground, andy's band. she says she can drink you under the table.}
<A>__{they stare at each other like two cats. eye level stares that go on and on. she finally hisses in a german accent.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{i'm nico. it's boring tonight. some of us are going downtown to a new club. you want to come?}
<A>__{a voice to kill, looks to undress, fully as tall as jim.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(distantly heard)}
<D>__{...elevate your taste in trolls man.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(to nico who reaches for her vodka)}
<D>__{vodka? race you.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{your death...}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(to ray and robbie)}
<D>__{wanna go?... come on let's go.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{she looks too freaky to me.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{wait just a minute.}
<A>__{as she floats away.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{come on there's pussy robbie.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{hey i met this chick lynne, she wants to be alone.}
<A>__{lynne is there, pretty, nods to jim.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{come on jim, let's go.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(childlike)}
<D>__{don't you guys wanna meet andy warhol?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{tell you the truth, i can live without him. he's a freak. let's get outta here. we got a show tomorrow.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{come on man! i thought we were gonna be a band, the four of us and party all night, rock and roll!}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i could never keep up with you jim. i couldn't make the music.}
<A>__{jim's eyes briefly on pamela giggling with the french count, putting her hand on his arm as she laughs. innocent, nothing meant but a moment...}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(desperate mockery, grabs ray)}
<D>__{don't go. don't leave! you can't leave. i don't know what will happen. it might be death.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{come on jim, this isn't our scene, these people are vampires. we gotta stick together man, the four of us. let's make the myths man.}
<A>__{a moment, strange. slightly slow motion. ray tapping jim's shoulder goodbye... robbie and john's faces passing on. as if they're parting in a symbolic way. jim blinking in the same slow motion, looking. nico is gone but tom is there, across the room, waving. the indian shaman looks like he's standing there in a corner. jim, ripped, heads for him, but the pr woman cuts him off. jim forgets he saw the indian.}
<C>__{pr man}
<D>__{right here jim, right here. andy's waiting. you know what you have in common is uniqueness.}
<A>__{past more faces. the music has subtly shifted to strange days somewhere along the way.}
<B>__{doors song}
<A>__{strange days have found us strange days have tracked us down they're going to destroy our casual joys we shall go on playing or find a new town past a cache of queens in white leather ogling jim, one of them coming over boldly, chatting him up (ad lib dimly heard), them grabbing his crotch and kissing him. jim rearing back, laughing but wary. past the rich ladies dripping with jewels and faces peeled from brazilian sleep tanks and swiss knives. past a young man dressed in jim morrison leather pants with his hair and eye make up, a warped image of jim, smiling back at him.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(looking for nico)}
<D>__{nico!}
