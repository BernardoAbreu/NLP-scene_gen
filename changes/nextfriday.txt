Debo crosses the street passing an old man dancing and directing traffic.  Debo stops, the man starts to dance in front of him.  He stares for a second, then he's on his way. Still walking tall and hard, he trips over a crack in the sidewalk (losing cool points). Three little black girls in plaid uniforms practice the latest dance steps on their way to school.  Debo is walking towards them.  They scream and take off in the other direction.  He smiles.  Briefly. Still walking; he stops at a corner.  A SA boy waits to cross with his low-rider bike.  A Metrolink train passes.  After it goes by; we see Debo riding off on the boy's bike.  He's on the ground holding his eye. Debo continues to ride through the city.
