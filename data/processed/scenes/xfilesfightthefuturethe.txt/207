<L>__{extremely high and wide}
<A>__{the agents mere specks fleeing the circle of churning ice and steam. as it cascades away in three hundred and sixty degrees. from here the deafening sound if absorbed into the vastness, tricking us of the reality of the massive movement of frozen material down below.}

<B>__{angle leading mulder and scully}
<A>__{as scully loses her footing, falling to the ground. mulder dragging her back up to her feet, though, maintaining forward momentum. while behind them the thundering force of the superheated melting snow and ice is moving in on them. and then suddenly mulder and scully are gone! the radial edge of the falling snow continuing only a few feet beyond where they disappeared. the violent upheaval of snow abating but slightly. beat, beat... then the agents appear again. thrust upward by a rising black precipice which catapults them off its leading edge. as they fall the distance to the sheet of ice below.}
