<L>__{interior subway tunnel that moment}
<A>__{a local train roars by, filling the screen. when it passes, we see tiptree with his suitcase, walking along the express tracks at the far wall of the tunnel more frightened with each step. it's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the only illumination comes from dim lanterns spaced at fifty foot intervals. he sees the lights of an express train behind him, and quickly switches to the local tracks. the train rumbles past with a deafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his surroundings. tiptree glances over at the inside wall of the tunnel... ...where he sees, huddled in an alcove just off the tracks, a small gathering of homeless people. they've set up camp down here in the tunnels, away from the elements. surrounded by bags full of old clothes, dining on canned food and cheap wine, they stare curiously at the well heeled stranger with the suitcase who's invaded their domain. tiptree eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening down the tunnel. the homeless make no move to follow with one exception. a kid, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty topcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively as tiptree vanishes into the shadows. his face is familiar. it's dick the boy vigilante from the park.}
