<A>__{the building opens onto the high rent section of sunset blvd. an outdoor cafe populated by the rich and trendy is next door. chev shakes himself off and bangs out of the revolving glass doors. a valet approaches him and chev gets in his face, flashing murderous teeth and shoving him away, hopping up and down to keep the heart pounding ... he heads over to the cab waiting out front. the same arab cabbie is waiting inside.}

<D>__{al qeada! al qeada!}
<A>__{everybody freaks out. a waiter dives under the a table, expecting an explosion. chev grabs the cabbie by his lapels and tosses him right into the cafe, smashing a table, still pointing and screaming.}
