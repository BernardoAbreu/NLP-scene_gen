<L>__{interior surgical bay day}
<A>__{two huge video screens are dominated by the cg images of archer and castor. as hoag briefs the team, the cg images glow to reflect the physical characteristic hoag refers to.}
<C>__{hoag}
<D>__{let's walk through it, jon. your blood types are different, but we can't do anything about that. otherwise, nature is cooperating nicely. the height difference is negligible within 1 2 an inch. eye color almost a perfect match. penis size, flaccid, essentially the same substantial.}
<A>__{from the observation booth above miller (flanked by tito and brodie) raises his eyebrow. on the video screens, the images morph to signify the physical augmentations.}
<C>__{hoag}
<D>__{hairline will be adjusted with laser shears... micro plugs for the body hair... the teeth will be bonded to match castor's...}
<A>__{hoag eyes castor's inert, tight body then turns to archer prodding his love handles like a livestock inspector.}

<D>__{how about an abdominoplasty?}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{abdomino what?}

<D>__{a tummy tuck. on the house.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{do it.}
<B>__{transformation montage}
<A>__{(intercut : huge video screen enlargements of archer and castor's body parts as necessary): globules of adipose tissue are siphoned off archer's obliques. at the same time... hoag recreates the "great sphinx" tattoo on archer's thigh. we push in on his leg, then pull back to reveal... archer and tito. the close up on his leg becomes a full shot as he walks across the rooftop like himself. tito demonstrated the proper "castor gait": dangerously casual, like a panther. hoag reproduces castor's fingerprints... then layers them over archer's fingers. archer practices castor's icy, killer glare. tito hands him a lit cigarette. archer brings the cigarette to his lips then coughs harshly. but he keeps trying. castor smiles... then smirks and laughs. pull back to reveal archer studying surveillance footage of castor on a monitor screen mimicking him. archer fusses with his new hair, trying to cover the thin spots. giving up, he zips up his sweatshirt getting the zipper caught in his new chest hair.}
