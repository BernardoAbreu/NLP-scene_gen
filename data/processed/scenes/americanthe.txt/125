<L>__{exterior locanda grappelli night}
<A>__{clara and jack sit at a table overlooking the town. the waiter lights their candle and deposits two menus peremptorily.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{una botiglia di acqua minerale non gasata et... una parasini, per favore.}
<A>__{completely ignoring her, the waiter addresses jack with a wink.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{menu in inglese?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, grazie.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{tedesco? olandese?}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(to the waiter)}
<D>__{he speaks italian. so do i. listen:}
<A>__{she repeats her order, articulating each word emphatically, like a teacher to a slow school child:}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{una botiglia di acqua minerale et una parasini, per favore.}
<A>__{she isn't upset. it's just her way of letting both men know that she's in charge. the waiter turns to her, deferring to her strength of character.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{gasata?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{non gasata.}
<A>__{he nods with some genuine deference and leaves. clara sighs.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(mostly to herself)}
<D>__{cittadina.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{small towns.}
<A>__{jack smiles. clara smiles back. they have this contempt in common. the waiter reappears and pours a thumbful of wine. it is pale red in colour and frizzante. at clara's insistence, jack tastes it. it is dry and has a tar like aftertaste.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{parasini. from calabria. it is good, you will agree?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it is. very good.}
<A>__{he looks at her and for a brief moment he undergoes what is a unique experience for him: a positive longing to repeat this brief moment many times in the future. clara catches the glow of his warmth and blossoms.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{can i ask you something, eduardo?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{you are married?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i doubt any of the couples here are. with the exception of the germans at table seven. she's wearing a wedding ring and they haven't spoken a word to each other for eight and half minutes.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i was sure this was your secret.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what makes you think i have a secret? i'm an ordinary man. i cough. i fart. i earn a living.}
<A>__{jack observes a gypsy selling roses.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i do not think you are an ordinary man. i think you are a good man. but you have a secret.}
<A>__{the gypsy approaches, offering clara a rose. she refuses firmly.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{he thinks we are a couple.}
<A>__{jack signals to the gypsy and buys clara a rose.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why spoil the illusion?}
<A>__{she looks at him and smiles.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{as long as we know it is an illusion.}
<A>__{her smile is only a little bit sad. still, jack doesn't know what to say. they are saved by the appearance of the waiter.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{buona sera. desidera?}
<A>__{clara orders, full of italian charm, putting jack at his ease. he watches her contentedly: the way she talks and moves.}
