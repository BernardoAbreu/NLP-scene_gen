<A>__{the piano music continuing over, as her fist closes round the end of his finger, then tries to pull it towards her mouth. he pulls it away from her and she frowns. he offers it again and the tug of war becomes a game. baby annie laughs. darwin writes something in his notebook. then tucks his pencil behind his ear and tries out various facial expressions scowling, smiling to gauge the baby's response. emma turns on the piano stool.}
