<A>__{both kids are asleep in the back seat. she's dreaming, her eyes roving behind closed lids. all of a sudden she stirs, eyes fluttering open in the dark. shivers. woken by a cold draft. she shivers, sits up, disentangling herself from the guy snoring quietly beside her in the cramped back seat. she locates the source of the draft. the stuck passenger window up front, where the duct tape newspaper patch has come loose. she shivers as a gust of wind blows a few snowflakes in. she grabs the roll of duct tape, climbs up into the front. tears off a fresh strip of tape off to replace the old one. she smooths it in place, her teeth chattering between yawns. just then the radio snaps on by itself.}

<A>__{the radio shuts off mid song. she holds still, scared to move, scared to even breathe. her eyes cut to the interior light as it starts flickering in a weird staccato way that's more morse code than loose wire. after a few seconds it stops. the seconds creep by on the dashboard clock. she peeks over the front seat looking out the back window, wondering where his highway patrol car is. which is when a gloved fist punches through the window and hauls her kicking and screaming out of the oldsmobile... nightmare exterior `57 chevy roadside night (1958) ... and into a sweltering summer night in the late 1950s... what follows is brutal and hallucinatory: a series of shots that thrust us into the sickening first person pov of a blonde young woman, 19, in the final moments of her life. the rasp of cicadas in the treetops provide the only soundtrack to the assault, as we see: close on their feet, high heels and boots, doing a violent two step as he drags her along the gravel road shoulder handheld footage as she's dragged toward his idling patrol car pov of a full moon in the tree tops, dispassionate spectator to the assault going on on this lonely stretch of road close up of the cop's mouth, twisted with lust as he whispers something obscene we cannot hear. close on his hand working it's way up to her throat, forcing his thick hairy thumb between her lips and making her suck. pov underneath his patrol car, as his boots kick her feet apart, and take up position between them the brim of his hat lifting to reveal him looking up with a scowl of surprise and the cop's scowl curdles into a look of outrage at sight of silhouettes of old men watching on the hilltop, roused by the commotion down on the road below the cop wrenches open the back door of the car, hurls her in, slams the door shut. he shoots a warning look in the direction of the silhouettes on the hilltop that says, "don't fuck with me..." then he climbs behind the wheel of his car and drives off.}
