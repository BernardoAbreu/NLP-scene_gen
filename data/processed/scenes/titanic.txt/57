<L>__{37 exterior terminal titanic}
<A>__{jack and fabrizio, carrying everything they own in the world in the kit bags on their shoulders, sprint toward the pier. they tear through milling crowds next to the terminal. shouts go up behind them as they jostle slow moving gentlemen. they dodge piles of luggage, and weave through groups of people. they burst out onto the pier and jack comes to a dead stop... staring at the cast wall of the ship's hull, towering seven stories above the wharf and over an eighth of a mile long. the titanic is monstrous. fabrizio runs back and grabs jack, and they sprint toward the third class gangway aft, at e deck. they reach the bottom of the ramp just as sixth officer moody detaches it at the top. it starts to swing down from the gangway doors.}

<A>__{right, come aboard. moody has quartermaster rowe reattach the gangway. jack and fabrizio come aboard. moody glances at the tickets, then passes jack and fabrizio through to rowe. rowe looks at the names on the tickets to enter them in the passenger list.}

<A>__{gundersen. and...}
<P>__{(reading fabrizio's)}
<A>__{gundersen. he hands the tickets back, eyeing fabrizio's mediterranean looks suspiciously.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(grabbing fabrizio's arm)}
<A>__{come on, sven. jack and fabrizio whoop with victory as they run down the white painted corridero... grinning from ear to ear.}
