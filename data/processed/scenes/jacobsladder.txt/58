<L>__{exterior a back alley day}
<A>__{the six men are walking quietly through an unpaved alley. it is already gray and getting darker.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i know what paul was talking about. i don't know how to say this ... but in a way it's a relief knowing that someone else saw them, too.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{you're seeing ... ?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{they're not human, i will tell you that. a car tried to run over me the other day. it was aiming straight for me. i saw their faces. they weren't from brooklyn.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{what are you tellin' me? they're from the bronx?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{it was no joke, rod.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{something weird is going on here. what is it about us? even in nam it was always weird. are we all crazy or something?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yeah, ever since that ...}
<A>__{he hesitates. they all understand.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{what's that have to do with anything?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it was bad grass. that's all it was.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{grass never did that to me.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you know, i've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. nothing penetrates that night. nothing.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{it's not worth goin' over again and again. whatever happened, happened. it's over.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{... i've seen them, too.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{shit!}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{so have i.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{look, there's something fucking strange going on here. you know paul's not the only one who's died. you remember dr. carlson over at bellevue? his car blew up, too.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{dr. carlson's dead?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{an explosion, just like paul's.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jesus!}
<C>__{george}

<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{okay, not you rod. but the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. they're tryin' to kill us. fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{do you think it has something to do with ... the offensive?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it's got something to do with some thing. i think we've got to confront the army. if they're hiding shit from us, we better find out what it is.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{come on, professor. the army's not gonna give you any answers. you'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{maybe that's the only way to get through. besides, six heads'll be better than one.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{not my head, buddy. not me. i'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{we should get ourselves a lawyer.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{i say you should get a shrink.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{too late. i've tried. i think you're right, jake. i'm game.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{me, too.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{you guys are fucking paranoid. it was bad grass. that's all it was. there's no such thing as demons.}
