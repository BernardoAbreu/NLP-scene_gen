<A>__{edward enters. he closes the door. he turns. and stops. a beautiful, candlelit, food laden table has been set up in the middle of the room. champagne and wine chills in a bucket. a fire burns in the fireplace. music is playing.}
<C>__{vivian }
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{edward turns. and stares again. vivian stands in the bedroom doorway. she is wearing an exquisite silk dressing gown. she looks incredibly beautiful.}

<D>__{nice.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{wait till you see what i have on underneath.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{she opens the dressing gown. what she has on underneath is absolutely nothing. edward crosses to her. taking her in his arms, he lifts her up and kisses her breasts.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{what about dinner?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{dinner can wait.}
