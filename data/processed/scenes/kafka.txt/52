<A>__{higher ground night they're at the graves at the very back of the cemetery, right up against the bottom of the castle wall that stretches high above them into the black sky of night. trees quiver around them. shadows dance. bizzlebek pauses at a particular grave, apart from the others, more hidden by overgrowth. he runs his fingertips over the old, strangely lettered inscription. he looks around the graveyard, making sure they're alone, then he moves to one side of the stone and leans his weight against it, pushing. it shifts and slides open, uncovering the hole that lies beneath.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{i was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day and i found this.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(unclear)}
<D>__{an empty tomb?}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{a cenotaph a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. but look }
<A>__{having lit the lantern he's brought with him, he holds it over the dark hole revealing a shaft and the rungs of a ladder.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{the castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague it's an escape route.}
<P>__{(offers kafka the lantern)}
<D>__{don't get stuck.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(accepts it)}
<D>__{not a chance. i'm the thinnest person i know.}
<B>__{the shaft}
<A>__{kafka starts to climb down, shoes loud on the rungs affixed to the stone wall of this well. but then he remembers something, pops back up.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{ you appreciate my writing.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{will you do me a favor then?}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{another one?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{if i don't see you later go to my house and find my notebooks and destroy them. all my manuscripts just burn them. please.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{what an extraordinary request!}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{it's my last and final one.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{then its authority is in doubt.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{a true friend would do it.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{not necessarily.}
<P>__{(a pointed look)}
<D>__{a wife would.}
