<L>__{interior dussander's basement night}
<A>__{todd realizes he can't get through the bars. he turns around to find another option. in the obscured background, archie begins to stir. silent and bewildered, he feels the area around him and rises slowly to his knees. todd doesn't see him and moves into a dark corner of the cellar, rummaging through the piles of cluttered junk for something to help him escape. he disappears for a moment into complete darkness and then emerges holding a shovel, a fresh confidence on his face. he holds it like a sledge hammer.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{we are wasting time now, boy.}
<P>__{(switches to a loud whisper)}
<D>__{come back to the door. you are not going to find anything down there to help you.}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{oh really?}
<A>__{todd runs toward the staircase and is only a few feet from archie when he sees him. todd, mortified, lets out a scream. this startles archie, who cannot speak. he only gurgles a sickening whine, the fork still sticks out of his neck. blood drips into his eyes from a gash above his forehead. yet even on his knees, he is an imposing figure.}
