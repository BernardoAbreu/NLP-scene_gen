<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior judge's chambers the next day}
<A>__{earl sits across from da deferlito and bryer. judge rittenband reviews both toll photos with a magnifying glass.}
<C>__{rittenband}
<D>__{well they look a little different to me, too... is there a reason you haven't allowed mr. monroe's investigator to conduct his own analysis? goldenrod 4.17.11 92.}
<C>__{deferlito}
<D>__{we've had some issues regarding chain of custody...}
<C>__{rittenband}
<D>__{...you don't have them anymore. you're to meet him with the evidence in the next hour.}
<C>__{deferlito}
<D>__{i'm afraid that's not possible.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{rittenband}
<D>__{where's the tape?}
<P>__{(another beat)}
<D>__{am i not speaking loud enough?}
<C>__{bryer}
<D>__{your honor...}
<C>__{rittenband}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{deferlito}
<D>__{it seems there's been...}
<C>__{rittenband}
<D>__{...let him tell me.}
<C>__{bryer}
<D>__{we don't know where it is.}
<C>__{rittenband}
<D>__{come again?}
<C>__{bryer}
<D>__{it's not in the evidence locker.}
<C>__{rittenband}
<D>__{where is it?}
<C>__{bryer}
<D>__{we don't know.}
<A>__{silence. rittenband leans forward.}
<C>__{rittenband}
<D>__{i will ask you one last time, detective. where is the tape?}
<C>__{bryer}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{we lost it. goldenrod 4.17.11 93.}
<C>__{rittenband}
<D>__{hmmm... in light of these developments, and i would think you should be very happy to hear this, with mr. monroe's approval i'm going to offer mr. deferlito the opportunity to voluntarily dismiss the indictment to save us all a bunch of embarrassment.}
<C>__{deferlito}
<D>__{i don't feel comfortable with that, your honor.}
<C>__{rittenband}
<D>__{further i'm going to put all charges against mr. grant under seal.}
<P>__{(bryer starts heading to the door)}
<D>__{this case is dismissed with prejudice and it is not to be refiled. hold on, detective.}
<P>__{(bryer stops.)}
<D>__{if you have another suspect in the automobile death then you are to present him, but mr. grant is free from any further inquiry in this matter. this is over. do i have your understanding?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past bryer.}
<C>__{rittenband}
<D>__{close the door, detective, please...}
<A>__{bryer closes it. the judge holds up the toll photos.}
<C>__{rittenband }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you finessed these, didn't you...?}
<C>__{bryer}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{rittenband}
<D>__{...you finessed it. i know it, and you know it.}
<A>__{no response.}
<D>__{goldenrod 4.17.11 94.}
<C>__{rittenband }
<D>__{i know who you're after. i saw all the evidence, not just the toll photo. you gotta get him the right way.}
<C>__{bryer}
<D>__{oh, okay.}
<P>__{(approaches the judge)}
<D>__{so let me get this straight: what you're telling me is i'm supposed to sit around with my thumb up my ass and my fingers crossed hoping that one of these fucking days, somewhere down the line, one of these rich assholes is gonna say the wrong thing loud enough so that we can't choose to ignore it anymore?}
<C>__{rittenband}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{get the fuck outta of my office.}
<C>__{bryer}
<D>__{yes, your honor.}
