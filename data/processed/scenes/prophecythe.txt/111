<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the sky thinning into uneasy pastels as the sun falls unceremoniously toward the mountains. a few lanterns have been lit, and from inside the kiva can be heard the chants of the navaho enemy ghost way. katherine's eyes are still on a horizon dropping off into shadow. she stiffens. there, at the end of the earth, appears a silent plume of dust. it could be anybody's car, but it can only be one car. thomas steps up beside her.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{he's coming.}
<A>__{thomas sticks his head into the kiva, speaks softly to one of the elderly villagers attending the ceremony.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{is there any way to speed this up?}
<C>__{villager}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{a fire has been built on the kiva's floor. through the choking smoke can be seen mary lying on a mat as grey horse chants to the yei spirits and adds fine colored earth to the growing sand painting beside her. his voice rises and falls in guttural syntax. he's coaxing. coaxing the alien spirit out of the child.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{lock the door.}
<A>__{he pulls his head out and hands katherine the pistol.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{stay inside. it's only one round, so make it count.}
<A>__{there's a pause and for a moment their eyes lock. she touches his arm, almost says something, then disappears into the kiva. thomas closes the door behind her. he turns and looks out at the distant plume of dust. growing closer.}
