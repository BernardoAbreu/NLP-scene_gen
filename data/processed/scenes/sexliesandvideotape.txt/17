<L>__{interior john and ann millaney's house day}
<A>__{cynthia is leaving the house. she gives john a big kiss.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{so since i've never had sex with you, by your own advice i shouldn't accept your advice.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{that's correct.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{bit of a dilemma, isn't it?}
<A>__{cynthia is not wearing her diamond stud earring.}
<L>__{interior doctor's office day}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{well, i don't know. the week started off okay, but then i was outside watering the plants, and i started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the greenhouse effect, so i went inside and turned on the air conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until i started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and }
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{radon leakage?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and you've never heard of this?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{no, i haven't.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i knew i shouldn't have watered those plants.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{did you confront john about the visitor?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{what visitor?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{the friend of john's that was staying at your house.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{oh, graham. no, i didn't talk to him about that. actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. i expected graham to be this...well, like john, you know? i mean, he said they had gone to school together, so i was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. but he turned out to be this...this kind of character, i mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{is he still at your house?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{no, he left last week.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{did you find him attractive?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{what do you mean, like physically?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{let me rephrase. were you attracted to him?}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{i guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. he's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. i'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? it's just boring. i don't know, he was just different. and he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and i like that, i felt comfortable around him.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{after he left i had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{so where's he from?}
