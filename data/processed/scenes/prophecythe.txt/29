<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the slam of a racquetball against the scarred white wall of an indoor court. it ricochets off the ceiling, hits the back glass partition, and is slammed again. four players, including thomas, grunt and sweat across the hardwood floor. it's brutal. shoulders and knees bang off one another. one of the players falls back, yells to thomas.}
<C>__{player}
<D>__{cover me! cover me!}
<A>__{thomas dives into position to make the save, recovers, and yells to the player as he dashes to the next corner.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{pop it up!}
<A>__{the player slams it brutally at thomas, who misses miserably.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{thanks a lot.}
<A>__{another player picks up the dead ball and puts his arm around thomas.}
<D>__{player #2 you're missing the point of the game, thomas. you must absolutely trust no one. form alliances, but break them. lure another to trust you, then betray him! you play with too much honor. sink to the gutter. use people. lie and double cross them.}
<A>__{player #2 tosses the ball to thomas, who serves, and the scuffling is back on. shouts to one another. promises of support.}
<D>__{player #2 come on thomas, let's take out sam together!}
<A>__{thomas and player #2 team up on a third player, pressing him hard. suddenly thomas breaks back, intercepts the ball, and drives against player #2. the about face is too abrupt for him and player #2 is eliminated in a double cross. he smiles proudly at thomas.}
<D>__{player #2 magnificent decadence.}
