<L>__{interior restaurant night}
<A>__{a very smart japanese restaurant. we see anna and william sitting, near the end of their meal.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{so who left who?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{she left me.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{she saw through me.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{uh oh. that's not good.}
<A>__{we've been aware of the conversation at a nearby table now we can hear it. two slightly rowdy men.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{no no no! give me anna scott any day.}
<A>__{william and anna look at each other.}
<C>__{gerald}
<D>__{i didn't like that last film of hers. fast asleep from the moment the lights went down.}
<A>__{again anna reacts.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{don't really care what the films are like. any film with her in it fine by me.}
<C>__{gerald}
<D>__{no not my type at all really. i prefer that other one blonde sweet looking has an orgasm every time you take her out for a cup of coffee.}
<A>__{anna mouths 'meg ryan.'}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{meg ryan.}
<A>__{william and anna smile they're enjoying it.}
<C>__{gerald}
<D>__{drug induced, i hear i believe she's actually in rehab as we speak.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{whatever, she's so clearly up for it.}
<A>__{anna's twinkle fades.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{you know some girls, they're all 'stay away chum' but anna, she's absolutely gagging for it. do you know that in over fifty percent of languages the word for "actress" is the same as the word for "prostitute."}
<A>__{this is horrible.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{and anna is your definitive actress someone really filthy you can just flip over...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right, that's it.}
<A>__{he gets up and goes round the corner to the men. there are in fact four of them, the two meeker men, gavin and harry, hanging on the other guys' witty words.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i'm sorry to disturb you guys but }
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{well, yes, i wish i hadn't overheard your conversation but i did and i just think, you know...}
<A>__{he's not a very convincing or frightening figure.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{...the person you're talking about is a real person and i think she probably deserves a little bit more consideration, rather than having jerks like you drooling over her...}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{oh sod off, mate. what are you, her dad?}
<A>__{anna suddenly appears at his side and whips him away without being recognized.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, that's fine. i love that you tried... time was i'd have done the same.}
<A>__{they walk on and then...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{in fact give me a second.}
<A>__{and she walks straight back to their table.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm sorry about my friend he's very sensitive.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{no, look, i'm sorry...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{please, please let's just leave it there. i'm sure you meant no harm, and i'm sure it was just friendly banter and i'm sure you dicks are all the size of peanuts. a perfect match for the size of your brains. enjoy your meal. the tuna's really good.}
<A>__{and she walks away. gerald turns to lawrence.}
<C>__{gerald}
<D>__{you prick.}
