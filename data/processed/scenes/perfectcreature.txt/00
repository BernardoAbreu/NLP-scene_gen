<D>__{for three hundred years the great plagues have swept the earth. diseases created from the experiments of the alchemists.}
<A>__{we see death tolls appear through this graphically. the plague 5 million souls. virulent small pox 10 million. mutated influenza 30 million souls...}

<D>__{...but there was also a miracle. one of these plagues helped nature create a new kind of being. at first they were called nosferatu, or vampire and were feared. but they were not supernatural monsters, just a better version of ourselves. they were the brothers, and their religion and science helped sustain us against the plagues and influenzas that have ravaged europe and the rest of the colonies. for 300 years our two races have lived in harmony. until now...}
