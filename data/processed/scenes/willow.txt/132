<D>__{sorsha!!}
<A>__{sorsha recoils in horror. bavmorda looks barely human: she has transformed into a grotesque witch. she waves her gnarled hand and her druids attack sorsha. sorsha kills them. the baby lies under a deathlike spell on the copper altar.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{i won't let you kill her!}
<A>__{bavmorda's voice is a demonic growl!}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{you are a weakling. like you fa ther! can you not see that i am about to become all powerful!}
<A>__{lightning explodes overhead. sorsha lunges for the baby. but bavmorda stops her with a powerful energy force.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{no!!}
<A>__{pulsating light lifts sorsha, levitates her across the room, and drives her toward a wall of spikes. just as she is about to be implaes, another force stops her. bavmorda can sense the source of it:}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{raziel...!!}
<A>__{the door flies open. the twelve burning candles all blow out. there stands raziel. sorsha falls to the floor, unconscious. raziel raises her arms magnifi cently. the sorceresses face each other.}
