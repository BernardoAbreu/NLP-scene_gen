<A>__{mulder appears, moving to the bathroom door. only to find an out of order sign on it. he moves to the woman's room, but it's locked. gathering what's left of his wits, mulder does what any red blooded man would do in this situation. he goes to the back door of the bar and exits into the alley.}

<C>__{watchful man's voice}
<D>__{that official fbi business?}
<C>__{mulder}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{what?}

<A>__{he's not far from mulder. his name is kurtzweil.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{bet the bureau's accusing you of the same thing in dallas.}
<A>__{mulder's weirded out as the stranger moves to him un threateningly.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{how's that?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.}
<A>__{kurtzweil enjoys a little laugh over this.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{do i know you?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{no. i've been watching your career for a good while. back when you were just a promising young agent before that.}

<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you follow me out here for a reason?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{yeah, i did.}
<A>__{kurtzweil unzips his own pants now. there is a moment; one of those awkward moments where mulder's not sure what's about to happen. but kurtzweil's just relieving himself, too. shuffling up to the wall, mulder takes this as an opportunity to head back toward the bar. but kurtzweil hails him again.}

<A>__{kurtzweil continues peeing. knows this got mulder's attention.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{back at the department of state. we were what you might call fellow travelers, but his disenchantment outlasted mine.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i never believed in the project.}
<A>__{mulder stares at kurtzweil now. he's being toyed with. he turns, opens the door into the bar. as kurtzweil gets a little louder.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{oh, come on. don't pretend you don't know about the project. your father died for it. your sister was taken because of it.}
<A>__{kurtzweil finishes nature's call. zips up. heads after mulder.}
