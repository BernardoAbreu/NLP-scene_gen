<P>__{(choking)}
<D>__{my...secret.}
<A>__{he slams the back of his head into parker's nose. breaking it. parker reels back in pain. sid 6.7 squeezes out from within the steel teeth. the jagged metal cutting into him, striping him with blood. the blood then begins to retract. sid 6.7's wounds, once again, heal themselves.}

<D>__{too bad you can't regenerate...}
<A>__{as the truck slows at an intersection, he jumps to the street. parker goes after him. still in excruciating pain. we pull back to reveal what you are seeing is}
<B>__{on a monitor}
<A>__{the scene continues seamlessly. as you may now be guessing, the monitor is connected to the simulator inside lindenmeyer's station in letac parker lies unconscious on a bed. he is connected to the simulator via the neural connectors in the polyurethane skull cap, just like he was before. the sid 6.7 character module is plugged into the system's main console. lindenmeyer sits at the controls. madison next to him, her gun aimed at lindenmeyer's head. they are both watching parker chase sid 6.7 on the monitor in front of them. parker continues experiencing intolerable pain. a clock reads 4:00 am. they are the only ones inside the entire facility.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<D>__{i told you this would work.. by setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. he still thinks he's in the real world.}

<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{what's wrong with parker?}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<P>__{(innocently)}
<D>__{how should i know?}
<C>__{madison}
<P>__{(getting an idea)}
<D>__{show me his physical sensory level.}
<A>__{she clicks back the hammer of her gun and presses the barrel against lindenmeyer's ear. he does as told. on a panel by the console, you read: participant physical sensory level: 670%.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<D>__{i wonder how that...}
<C>__{madison }
<D>__{turn it down!}
<A>__{lindenmeyer adjusts the sensory level back down to 100%.}
<B>__{on a monitor}
<A>__{parker immediately returns back to normal. his pace picks up. he starts closing the gap between him and sid 6.7 as he races into a shopping mall.}
