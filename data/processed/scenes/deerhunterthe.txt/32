<A>__{nick takes off. linda sits down at a table and merle goes to the cooler to get a miller's. he gropes around in the tub, finds one and pops the tab. suddenly he notices that nick has crossed to the sad looking girl by the wall. he has stopped in front of her and is asking her something. the sad looking girl gives a blush, gets out of her chair and nick takes her in his arms and begins to dance. the sad looking girl looks transformed. she begins chattering and laughing. merle crosses back to linda and gives her the beer. as he pulls up a chair to sit down beside her he stumbles and nearly loses his balance. he is very drunk.}
