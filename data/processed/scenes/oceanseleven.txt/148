<A>__{frank stands at attention before linus and benedict. linus, straddling a desk, takes a beeper off his belt when it pinches him. benedict checks his watch: the fight's opening bell is growing closer and closer.}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{thank you for your cooperation, mr. escalante.}
<P>__{(as frank nods, not at all)}
<D>__{or should i call you mr. catton?}
<A>__{frank bristles, tries not to let it show. linus pulls out a xeroxed mug shot and bio of him.}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{you are frank catton? formerly of the tropicana, the desert inn and the new york state penitentiary system?}
<C>__{linus }
<P>__{(as frank remains quiet)}
<D>__{your silence suggests you don't refute that.}
<P>__{(to benedict)}
<D>__{mr. benedict, i'm afraid you've been employing an ex convict. as you know, the n.g.c. strictly forbids...}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{goddamn cracker...}
<C>__{linus}
<P>__{(a pause; he can't}
<D>__{believe he just}
<P>__{heard that)}
<D>__{pardon me.}

<D>__{that has nothing to do with...}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(over him, ranting)}
<D>__{... some cracker cowboy like you's gotta kick him out on the street. want me to jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton, won't let me deal cards, might as well call it whitejack.}
<C>__{linus}
<P>__{(a beat, then)}
<D>__{i resent your implication that race has anything to do with this.}
<P>__{(to benedict)}
<D>__{now, as i was saying, the nevada gaming commission strictly forbids the employment of the colored...}
<P>__{(whoops)}
<D>__{... i mean...}
<A>__{that does it: frank attacks linus, lunging at the man, and as benedict steps in to separate the two... ... linus's hand dips into his tuxedo jacket and withdraws the vault combination.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay, okay, i'm cool.}
<C>__{benedict}
<P>__{(to linus)}
<D>__{you alright?}
<C>__{linus}
<P>__{(a beat, then)}
<D>__{yeah.}
