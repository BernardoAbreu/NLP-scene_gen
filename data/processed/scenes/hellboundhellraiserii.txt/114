<L>__{interior elevator day}
<A>__{the elevator is uncomfortably full, kirsty and tiffany squashed up against the back while the interns hold the gurney in the centre. the elevator is descending. the ride seems to take longer than it should, even though they are going to basement level;like the look of tiffany's room, it's almost normal but just different enough to make us slightly uneasy in an un focused way. eventually, though, it does come to a stop. tiffany squeezes kirsty's shoulder sympathetically (note. re: tiffany's character it should be clear to the audience by this stage that, though she is still mute, tiffany is now a responsive, more rounded character) the interns wheel the gurney out of the elevator and the girls follow.}
