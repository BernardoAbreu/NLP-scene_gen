<L>__{exterior outside the castle night}
<A>__{moving into the chopper, anna glimpses, bunny, the obnoxious dog, in a mayflower logo dog tag, taking a leak on some bushes. she fakes a yawn to the like dressed kit kat who fakes one back.}
<L>__{interior the g. machine room night}
<A>__{kaplan, hawk, and the other agents march into the mammoth room of the opening scene. in the place of where one remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets, beneath which are unassembled parts of the machine. inside, a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball machine. in tennis gear and goggles, darwin mayflower thwacks it against the wall of (now faded) frescos. also in tennis threads, minerva is laying on a chaise lounge holding a gadget in her hand.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{seven!}
<A>__{minerva turns the gadget up to seven and presses a button. another tennis ball shoots out, a little faster. darwin batters it. the ball ricochets into the forehead of an "amused" alfred who is retrieving balls in sweat pants.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{jolly. good. shot. sir.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{ooh, it's hudson hawk, you cease to amaze me, convict. you are a terrible cat burglar!}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{haven't you ever seen, like david niven? you know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{like a "cat", one could say.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{shucks, i will just take it back.}
<A>__{hawk reaches for the codex. kaplan pulls it over to darwin, who pulls up his goggles and fondles the ancient binding. taking a knife from kaplan, he begins to slit it open.}
<C>__{minerva}
<P>__{(bouncing up)}
<D>__{no, let me!}
<C>__{darwin}
<P>__{(pout)}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<A>__{hawk looks away to the billowing sheets and the strange machine parts behind them. minerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri cally perverted crystal.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{another piece of the puzzle for the da vinci alchemy project.}
<A>__{kaplan, darwin, and minerva look up to hawk, then to each other, all start to speak, then all stop. this quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin flunkies.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{oh, you. there's nothing more i hate than failure. all you had to do was follow the hawk, it's not like i said "teach our nation's children how to read."}
<A>__{hawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{i guess we're just going to have to kill 'em...}
<A>__{shockingly swift, minerva pulls a small gun from beneath her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each set of flunky eyes, splattering them to the ground.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{god minerva, i was kidding .}
<B>__{a shocked hawk}
<A>__{quickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a sheet. he reveals the familiar gold machine demonhead.}
<B>__{the mayflowers}
<A>__{reverberate off each other with laughter. bloodstained, kaplan and almond joy exchange an eye bulge. minerva's smile disappears as she sees hawk by the sheets.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{get away from there, convict!}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{just browsing. don't touch me....}
<A>__{snickers touches him. hawk smashes him in the jaw. snickers rears back to reciprocate....}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{don't hurt him! we need him for the final job!}
<A>__{snickers stops himself, snarling in frustration. hawk is suddenly the happiest man he's been in italy.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{oh weeeeelly, don't hurt me? even if i do this....}
<A>__{hawk pulls snickers' glasses off and stamps them.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{and this....}
<A>__{hawk knees butterfinger in the stomach.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{surely this must offend....}
<A>__{hawk body block dominoes butterfinger and snickers to the ground. kaplan and almond joy aim their guns.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{that's it!}
<A>__{playfully lifting his shirt, hawk grabs minerva and manually swivels her hips to the beat of his.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{things are getting a little loose at the da vinci workshop tonight. "put your left leg in, take your right foot out." may i call you minnie....}
<A>__{hawk mambos to alfred who rifles his blade up to hawk's crotch. hawk stops dancing.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{hey, guys, i've always wanted to sing like franki valli and the other seasons, but come on....}
<A>__{alfred moves the blade a little upward. hawk a a ghs.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{big girls don't cry i eye.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{two minutes, 35 seconds. damnit, i'm involved in this thing, so i just wanna know what this thing is. i wanna be treated as an adult.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{that's fair. tomorrow. back in rome. now go to your room.}
<A>__{alfred strategically vulcans hawk on the neck. he falls.}
