<D>__{the thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb. one of evolution's most ingenious inventions; a built in tool sensitive to texture, contour and temperature: an alchemical lever; the secret key to technology; the link between the mind and art; a humanizing device. the marmoset and the lemur are thumbless; none of the new world monkeys has opposable thumbs; the spider monkey's thumbs are absent or reduced to a tiny tubercle; the thumbs of the potto are set at an angle of one hundred eighty degrees to the other digits.}

<A>__{views of sissy admitted to a hospital blood analyzed in a laboratory. powerful lamps turn on in an operating room. iv tubes are inserted in veins. sissy is wheeled into surgery. an anesthesiologist sticks a needle into a curved and creamy ass. an anesthesiologist sticks needles into a long, graceful neck. a nurse scrubs an arm. a body and table are draped with sheets to create a sterile field. a tourniquet is placed on a slender right arm. an elastic rubber bandage is applied so tightly it squeezes most of the blood out of an arm. a tourniquet is inflated. a surgeon outlines in iodine an incision around the base of a thumb. pale smooth skin is incised along a premarked line and dissected down to the bone. woman flesh is sewn shut with four ought nylon suture. a tourniquet is deflated, a bloody arm bathed. a young woman is rolled into a recovery room. a nurse and two surgeons, their attention directed by an intensifying pinkish glow, turn to stare into a metal pan, where a huge human thumb, disarticulated from the hand it has been severed from, is now flopping about like a trout, or rather, arching and thrusting itself in a calculated and endlessly repeated gesture, the gesture of the hitchhike.}
