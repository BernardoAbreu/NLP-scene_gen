<L>__{interior military medical room night}
<A>__{tight on nelec. past an iv and medical machinery. he's looking at someone we don't yet see. in the background, overmyer stands, watching. nelec is quiet, simple:}
<C>__{nelec}
<D>__{i don't want any more trouble. do you?}
<A>__{now we see who he's talking to. it's dr. woodward. battered and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid, but defiant.}
<C>__{nelec }
<D>__{we've been going through your belongings, looking for evidence. of what you knew, how you knew it... and who else might know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i remember you. in the lab. and i recall we didn't see eye to eye, but that's no excuse for doing what you did here.}
<A>__{dr. woodward swallows. feels that his time on earth is coming to an end no matter what he does here. by the door, overmyer is quietly putting on his black gloves.}
<C>__{nelec }
<D>__{so in the spirit of moving forward and avoiding more trouble, tell us where you put your research. i know you had someone document the crash that night. tell me who that was and i will help you, i swear to god. on my mother's life if you help us now, we will take care of you.}
<C>__{dr. woodward}
<D>__{i've seen what happens, mr. nelec, when you take care of people.}
<C>__{nelec}
<D>__{ i'm going to bait him. i'm going to catch him.}
<C>__{dr. woodward}
<D>__{he's in me, you know. as i am in him. so when you see him next, as i'm sure you will... i will be watching you, too.}
<A>__{nelec offers a vague, searching smile. but woodward will not not ever relent. so. nelec moves to the door, he remains facing camera, his back to woodward, as overmyer moves to the bed. push in on nelec's face, understanding his true nature}
