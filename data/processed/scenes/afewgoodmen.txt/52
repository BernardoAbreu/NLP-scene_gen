<A>__{the whole place, in stark contrast to the washington navy yard, is ready to go to war. fighter jets line the tarmac. ground crews re fuel planes. hurried activity. a 36 seat airforce jet rolls to a stop on the tarmac and a stair unit is brought up. howard, a marine corporal, is waiting by the stairway as the passengers begin to got off. mostly marines, a few sailors, a couple of civilians, and kaffee, jo and sam. kaffee and sam are wearing their summer whites, jo is in khakis. kaffee and sam stare out at what they see: they're not in kansas anymore. howard shouts over the noise from the planes.}
