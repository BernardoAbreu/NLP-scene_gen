<A>__{joe sits at the front, opposite the driver, cracking his gum as he watches the huge billboards streaking by, promising him power, happiness and beautiful women if he chooses the right breakfast food, hair oil or automobile. joe listens to the humming tires, the roar of the engine, shaking his head.}

<D>__{this is a powerful mothah, ain't it?}
<A>__{ignored by the driver, joe rises and walks back to his empty double seat, glancing around to see what impression he's made on his immediate fellow travelers an old lady in front of him a hostile young sailor with acne behind him two teeny boppers flirting with joe hysterically a pale blonde directly across the aisle, smiling at joe weakly.}
