<A>__{"the whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon, is the central and inevitable fact of human existence." thomas wolfe, "god's lonely man" travis bickle, age 26, lean, hard, the consummate loner. on the surface he appears good looking, even handsome; he has a quiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from nowhere, lighting up his whole face. but behind that smile, around his dark eyes, in his gaunt cheeks, one can see the ominous stains caused by a life of private fear, emptiness and loneliness. he seems to have wandered in from a land where it is always cold, a country where the inhabitants seldom speak. the head moves, the expression changes, but the eyes remain ever fixed, unblinking, piercing empty space. travis is now drifting in and out of the new york city night life, a dark shadow among darker shadows. not noticed, no reason to be noticed, travis is one with his surroundings. he wears rider jeans, cowboy boots, a plaid western shirt and a worn beige army jacket with a patch reading, "king kong company 1968 70". he has the smell of sex about him: sick sex, repressed sex, lonely sex, but sex nonetheless. he is a raw male force, driving forward; toward what, one cannot tell. then one looks closer and sees the evitable. the clock sprig cannot be wound continually tighter. as the earth moves toward the sun, travis bickle moves toward violence. film opens on exterior of manhattan cab garage. weather beaten sign above driveway reads, "taxi enter here". yellow cabs scuttle in and out. it is winter, snow is piled on the curbs, the wind is howling. inside garage are parked row upon row of multi colored taxis. echoing sounds of cabs idling, cabbies talking. steamy breath and exhaust fill the air.}

<A>__{credits appear over scenes from manhattan nightlife. the snow has melted, it is spring. a rainy, slick, wet miserable night in manhattan's theatre district. cabs and umbrellas are congested everywhere; well dressed pedestrians are pushing, running, waving down taxis. the high class theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows are shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the poor and common is also falling on them. the unremitting sounds of honking and shouting play against the dull pitter patter of rain. the glare of yellow, red and green lights reflects off the pavements and autos. "when it rains, the boss of the city is the taxi driver" so goes the cabbie's maxim, proven true by this particular night's activity. only the taxis seem to rise above the situation: they glide effortlessly through the rain and traffic, picking up whom they choose, going where they please. further uptown, the crowds are neither so frantic nor so glittering. the rain also falls on the street bums and aged poor. junkies still stand around on rainy street corners, hookers still prowl rainy sidewalks. and the taxis service them too. all through the credits the exterior sounds are muted, as if coming from a distant room or storefront around the corner. the listener is at a safe but privileged distance. after examining various strata of manhattan nightlife, camera begins to close in on one particular taxi, and it is assumed that this taxi is being driven by travis bickle.}

<A>__{betsy, smartly dressed, waves goodbye to another campaign worker and walks out the door to greet him. a short while later, travis and betsy are walking down broadway toward times square. betsy does not let their bodies touch as they walk although travis contemplates edging closer to her. betsy has opened the package and is admiring the record or, rather, travis' sentiment behind giving it. travis looks around himself with pride: this is a moment in his life one of the few.}

<A>__{travis seems confused. he is so much part of his own world, he fails to comprehend another's world. compared to the movies he sees, this is respectable. but then there's also something that travis could not even acknowledge, much less admit: that he really wants to get this pure white girl into that dark porno theatre. travis makes an awkward gesture to escort betsy into the theatre. betsy looks at the tickets, at the theatre, at travis. she mentally shakes her head and walks toward the turnstile. she thinks to herself: "what the hell. what can happen?" she's always been curious about these pictures anyway, and like all women, no matter how intelligent she's been raised not to offend her date. a perverse logic which applies even more in offsetting circumstances like these.}
<B>__{inside the theater}
<A>__{travis escorts betsy to an empty center row. travis was right. couples do go to films like this. there are at least six or seven other men with their bewigged "dates". travis settles into his familiar porno theatre slouch. betsy looks curiously from side to side. on screen, a conservatively dressed middle aged woman is speaking in swedish about importance of healthy sex life in a happy marriage. subtitles translate her words. then, without warning, there is a direct cut : to a couple copulating on a sterile table like bed. travis watches intently. the color, however, is slowly draining from betsy's cheeks. one thought fills her mind: "what am i doing here?"}

<A>__{night. travis' taxi picks up a fare in the midtown area and heads downtown. lower east side. travis lets off fare on b street and cuts across toward tompkins square. travis turns the corner when skreetch! he suddenly hits the brakes, causing the cab to rock back and forth. he has almost hit a young girl recklessly crossing the street. she thumps her hand on the taxi hood to regain her balance and stares in shock through the front window. c.u. girl's face. travis recognizes her face: it's iris, the girl in his taxi a week or so before. iris looks at travis sharply then turns and continues walking. travis' eyes follow her and she rejoins a girlfriend. they are both dressed as hippie hookers: sloppy clothes, boots, jeans, floppy hats. and the old come hither walk is unmistakable. travis follows iris and her girlfriend slowly as they walk down the sidewalk. travis' p.o.v. he examines them from bottom to top boots, legs, thighs, breasts, faces, hats. as travis rolls astride the girls, he notices the familiar fringe of a suede jacket standing in the shadows. the girls look toward the shadowed figure, smile, acknowledge some unheard comment, and continue on. iris looks back uneasily at travis' taxi and continues on. on the corner stand two well to do college students, somewhat out of place in this environment, but making every attempt to groove on it. they are high on something or another. the girls spot the college students and walk over to them. they exchange some small talk and walk off together. there is little subtlety involved: it is obviously a pick up. travis must negotiate a turn around the corner if he is to continue following the girls and their collegiate johns. this is not so easy, since the traffic is heavy. as travis slows down to make the turn, he notices another hippie hooker who had been watching him watching iris and her girlfriend. she walks over to the taxi, loans in the open left front window and gives travis the come on disguised as an innocent question:}
<B>__{c.u. hippie hooker.}
<C>__{hippie hooker}
<D>__{hey cabbie! you comin' or goin'?}
<A>__{travis quickly turns his face away from her in a combination of shock, embarrassment and revulsion. he is the child caught with his hand in the cookie jar. the very presence of this crassly, openly sexual human being frightens and sickens him. travis takes off with a skreetch. his taxi shoots down the block.}

<A>__{a hot june day. travis' taxi, the "off duty" sign on, is parked against the curb somewhere in harlem. white cops, secret service men and reporters, punctuate the otherwise black crowds which walk to and fro in the b.g. charles palantine's voice can be heard coming from a distant loudspeaker system. it is a political rally. travis sits behind the wheel, coldly staring at something in the distance. his hair, of course, is still clipped short and he wears mirror reflecting sunglasses. even though a drop of sweat is working its way down his cheek, travis wears his army jacket with the bulge on the left side the .38 smith and wesson bulge. a block away, palantine stands on a platform outside his uptown campaign headquarters. on the platform sit an array of black dignitaries. nearby we recognize the secret service man travis spoke to at the earlier rally: he scans the crowd anxiously. palantine is speaking animatedly. he is an excellent speaker and captures our attention. he drives hard toward his arguments, crashes down on his points. his strained voice rings with sincerity and anger. c.u. of palantine as he speaks. he is dressed in rolled up shirtsleeves and sweat pours down his face.}

<A>__{all live sound ceases as travis' narration begins. he is reading from a letter or card he has just written. as he speaks we see shots of palantine speaking, a seated row of young black palantine red, white and blue bedecked cheerleaders, secret service agents examining the crowd and so forth. these shots have no direct relationship to the narration.}

<A>__{travis, at his desk, examines the card upon which he has just written this letter. c.u. cover of card. it is a 25 wedding anniversary card with a four color embossed cover. the design could only be described as ur kitsch. a cartoon mr. and mrs. all america stand before an outdoor barbecuing grill, clicking salt and pepper shakers in a toast. sentiment reads:}

<A>__{night on the lower east side. travis sits parked in the dark shadows of a side street. the lone wolf waits. travis watches the slum goddesses as they work the section of the street reserved for hippie hookers. travis' p.o.v.: some of the young street girls are arrogant, almost aggressive, others are more insecure and inexperienced. a black man charges down the sidewalk across the street from travis. he walks at a fast, maniacal clip, looking only at the sidewalk in front of him. out of his mouth comes a continuous stream of invective: "that cock sucking crazy no good asshole bitch when i get my fucking fingers on her nigger tits i'm gonna ring em and shit up her ass..." and so on. he is out of control. nobody seems to notice or care. travis takes a swig of peach brandy and continues his stake out. finally, travis spies the object of his search: iris walks down the sidewalk with her girlfriend. iris wears her large blue sunglasses. travis checks to see if his .38 is in place (it is), opens the door and exits from the cab. flipping up the collar of his army jacket, travis slouches over and walks toward iris. he sort of sidles up next to her and walks beside her: travis always looks most suspicious when he's trying to appear innocent.}
