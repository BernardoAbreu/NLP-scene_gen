<A>__{the shot continues to track through the man sized shaft. as we move through the shaft turning corners, going up floors we pass grills. some of them show light coming from the apartments within. we can hear an argument in one room. a crying child in the nexterior a tv blaring in another (playing porno). but mostly the rooms are dark. and as we move up and along, there is a scuttling noise, growing louder, as if we are approaching it. then the noise stops. the camera halts, stares down the long ventilation shaft. silence. dead silence. the camera starts to move again and then turns a corner to run into the leering face of edgar, the vampire, his teeth bared, his eyes reflecting in the half light. then he smiles.}

<A>__{cut to a rat, staring back at edgar. the rat turns and streaks off back whence it came. a slight smile appears on edgar's face; a smile that can chill the blood in your veins. then he begins to move forward. we hear his breathing; low, but excited. he moves with the precision and strength of an insect. his eyes glisten and reflect light like an animal's. his skin is flesh white and milky in the metal shaft. cut to his pov approaching a grill. a subdued light comes through it. the pov approaches and sees into the apartment below.}
