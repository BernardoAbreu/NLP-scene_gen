<L>__{interior dwight and caroline's living room late afternoon}
<A>__{caroline is painting the white walls a soothing buff color. on the sofa lie half finished curtains she's making. she is totally focused. she hears toby, turns, sees his filthy clothes. her shoulders sag.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i won't do it, you know. i won't be a referee between the two of you.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{who asked you?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you both do. you do. just by coming home like this you ask me to take your side when he raises hell.}
<C>__{caroline }
<D>__{well, the answer's 'no.' i'm going to make this marriage work. no fights.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, the bride is calm. who the hell cares?}
<A>__{caroline refuses to argue. she picks up a piece of material and holds it up to the window to see if her choice of color was a good one.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{... seems like this place is so ugly. seems like everywhere i look there's something... ugly.}
