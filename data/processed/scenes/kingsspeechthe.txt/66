<C>__{winston churchill }
<D>__{nice of you to invite me to your digs, stanley.}
<L>__{interior baldwin's study, 10 downing street day}
<A>__{baldwin and churchill are alone together. no love lost between these two men.}
<C>__{baldwin}
<D>__{as you may have guessed...}
<A>__{churchill is silent. balwin waits, then:}
<C>__{baldwin }
<D>__{...i intend to resign. the royal scandal has weakened my position considerably.}
<A>__{churchill, on the edge of his seat, can't suppress an anticipatory grin. baldwin takes pleasure in deflating it.}
<C>__{baldwin }
<D>__{no need to volunteer your services, winston. neville chamberlain will take my place, once this royal matter is settled. as chancellor of the exchequer he already lives next door.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{my opportunity to redecorate will come soon enough, stanley.}
<C>__{baldwin}
<D>__{will it? well, enough chit chat. the question of a morganatic marriage, as a possible solution, has been put to the dominion prime ministers. after all, hm is their king too.}
<A>__{baldwin has a sheath of telegrams in hand.}
<C>__{baldwin }
<D>__{australia: no.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{david feels there aren't that many people in australia.}
<C>__{baldwin}
<D>__{canada: no. union of south africa: an inappropriate marriage would create a permanent wound. the irish free state: states it is not really their affair, and, bluntly, our english king may marry any whore he wants, they'll be well out of it.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{bloody irish.}
<C>__{baldwin}
<D>__{new zealand...wavers.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{ah, the kiwis!}
<C>__{baldwin}
<D>__{being rather remote, they've not even heard of mrs simpson. hardly a winning hand.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{baldwin }
<D>__{this is not about true love, winston. this is about who's in charge. does the king do what he wants, or what his people want him to do? does the king own his nation, or does the nation own their monarch?}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{he won't budge.}
<C>__{baldwin}
<D>__{nor will we.}
