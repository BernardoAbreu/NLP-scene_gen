<L>__{interior ground floor hallway night}
<A>__{various shots as the bumping seems to travel down the hallway. a rushing sound with it. they're the same sounds, from the scene before, but somehow have none of the impact, none of the presence as they did in theo's bedroom.}
<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{luke lets the door shut, turns off the faucet. the sounds of the plumbing die away.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{do you need me anymore? cause i'm going to bed. they can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but i gotta try to get some sleep.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{luke leaves the kitchen. theo and nell watch him go.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{if this was some sort of joke, i'm going to kill him.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{you know it wasn't a joke, theo.}
<A>__{marrow watches the exchange closely.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{the cold sensation. who felt it first?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{theo i think. you've asked us that three times, doctor marrow. what's going on?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{how do you feel about luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing? water hammer, something like that?}
<A>__{theo and nell look at each other in frustration. but theo tries to get her mind around the question.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{i did just take a bath. i don't know.}
