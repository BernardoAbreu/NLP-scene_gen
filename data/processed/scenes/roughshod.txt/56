<A>__{sky. dark rain clouds blown by a high wind. sound of thunder.}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{rain the caravan. clay leads it through a rain that has filled the ruts in the trail, soaked the horses to glistening black and obscures all view of the country through which they are passing. sound of rain falling is loud. clay and steve both wear slickers, gleaming from their shoulders to the rumps of their horses. mary, a tarp around her shoulders, drives. elaine and helen huddle under a tarpaulin in the wagon bed.}

<C>__{mary}
<D>__{she should be in bed where it's dry.}

<A>__{rain down angle featuring clay and mary.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(dryly)}
