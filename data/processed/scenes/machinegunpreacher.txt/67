<L>__{exterior dirt road rural uganda day}
<A>__{a dirt road cutting through grassy plain stretching in every direction... and we see a bright yellow bus speeding toward us in the distance, kicking a rooster tail of dust high into the air... and as it gets closer we see 15 or 20 men piled onto the roof, hanging on for dear life as this bus bounces over the road...}
<L>__{interior bus driving rural uganda same}
<A>__{... sam and deng crammed into this crowded bus...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{they always drive this fast?}
<C>__{deng}
<D>__{traveling is the most dangerous time in sudan. if the rebels find you on the open road it would be very bad.}
<A>__{an awkward silence as deng stares out the window. sam wanting to connect here, but deng is reticent.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you got kids, deng?}
<C>__{deng}
<D>__{no. i have no children.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{where you from?}
<C>__{deng}
<D>__{a little village called aweil. many hours from here.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's where your family is?}
<A>__{and deng simply says...}
<C>__{deng}
<D>__{my family was killed by lra.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{unyama is about two hours from here. we will stop there for lunch.}
<A>__{deng turns and looks out the window again, silent, quietly watching the land blur past. and sam says nothing more, intuitively feeling this man's need to be alone in the moment. a great, lost giant.}
