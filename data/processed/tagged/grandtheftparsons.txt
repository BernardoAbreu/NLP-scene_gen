<B>__{opening title.}
<A>__{"although this motion picture is inspired by a true story, certain characters and events are fictional."}
<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{super: 'september 1973'.}
<L>__{interior phil kaufman's bedroom. night}
<A>__{a phone rings in the dark. a little light falls from the open window, illuminating an old bakelite telephone. it sits on a small table alongside a large amount of empty bottles and a couple of overflowing ashtrays.}
<L>__{exterior phil's trike. night}
<A>__{a three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the night at great speed. the trike is moving very quickly, its headlights cutting through the darkness, its wheels sending a spray of sand flying towards us, as the driver fights to keep it on the road. this is phil kaufman, and he's in a hurry.}
<L>__{interior joshua tree inn room 8. night}
<A>__{two figures are struggling on the floor. the male is naked. the woman sits astride him, her movements urgent, her breath fast. they appear to be having sex.}
<L>__{exterior trike. dawn}
<A>__{the trike cuts through the night, and we pull back to show desert, more desert, and then... a giant bright, flickering neon sign: 'welcome to the joshua tree inn'.}
<L>__{interior phil kaufman's bedroom. night}
<A>__{that phone still ringing; shrill, insistent. there is a bed next to the table. it is covered in clothes, but there is also a man's shape, which now moves.}
<L>__{interior joshua tree inn room 8. night}
<A>__{a little more light, and it now appears as if our man and woman are struggling. there is fear on her face.}
<L>__{interior phil kaufman's bedroom. night}
<A>__{still that insistent ringing, and the covers suddenly fly off the bed. we see the man from behind as he shakes the sleep away and looks for the damn phone.}
<L>__{interior joshua tree inn room 8. night}
<A>__{the woman is screaming now, and banging on the man's chest with her fists. he is motionless underneath her.}
<L>__{exterior outside joshua tree inn. dawn}
<A>__{the trike skids to a halt amid a cloud of dust and the driver leaps off. he runs at the door, throwing it open in one movement, disappearing into the room. a broken striped 'no entry police' band flutters to the ground.}
<L>__{interior phil kaufman's bedroom. night}
<A>__{the man finally answers the phone. at last the ringing stops.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{hello?}
<L>__{exterior outside joshua tree inn room 8. night}
<A>__{the door bounces back open, and we can see the phil walking quickly through the room. as he searches, we hear:}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{oh my god please help me! i found your number in his pocket and i don't know... i don't know what to do.}
<C>__{phil's voice}
<D>__{ah, what... who are you?}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{he's dead... he's dead... and i'm... just... i don't know what to do.}
<A>__{the man glances into the bathroom and opens some drawers.}
<C>__{phil's voice}
<D>__{hold on. tell me who's dead.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{parsons. gram parsons. we met in a bar and we had a lot to drink and he just...}
<C>__{phil's voice}
<D>__{are you sure he's dead?}
<A>__{he looks under the beds.}
<T>__{con tinue d:}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{yeah. he's really dead. he just...}
<C>__{phil's voice}
<D>__{listen. call an ambulance. where are you?}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{joshua tree. joshua tree inn. room eight.}
<A>__{he checks on top of the wardrobe.}
<C>__{phil's voice}
<D>__{have you got a car?}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{phil's voice}
<D>__{call an ambulance. then get out of there. okay? okay?}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{yeah, okay. i'm goin'...}
<A>__{he picks up a sheet of paper from the bedside table and glances at it. he turns and walks past us to the car and for the first time we see phil kaufman's face.}
<L>__{exterior joshua tree hospital. morning}
<A>__{the trike skids to a halt outside the small white hospital. there are a couple of press vehicles parked outside, and a reporter is recording a piece to camera in the background. phil sits for a moment, and then opens the door and walks to the entrance.}
<L>__{interior joshua tree hospital. morning moments later}
<A>__{we move through the reception area up to the nurses' station. phil is in conversation with a large woman in a nurse's uniform.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{you wanna run that by me again, sir?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{okay. i'd like to see gram parsons.}
<A>__{they stare at each other.}
<T>__{con tinue d:}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{you want to see gram parsons?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{yes. alone, if possible. and would you have a gurney standing by in case i need to move him?}
<A>__{she looks carefully at the pyjamas which peek out from under the shabby overcoat. his hair is on end. he is wearing biker boots and is holding an unlit but half smoked cigar.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{and you are.... his physician? or perhaps a close relative?}
<A>__{phil clears his throat.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{actually, i'm his road manager.}
<A>__{the big nurse smiles mirthlessly.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{so you're not his physician or a close relative?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{mister parsons is awaiting a post mortem. he will then be delivered to his family. i suggest you speak to them if you wish to pick through his personal effects. sir.}
<A>__{she turns away.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{now listen here...}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{no, you listen here. mister parsons is dead and no longer appears to need a road manager. which makes two of us.}
<A>__{the nurse turns and marches down the corridor. phil waits until she's gone and then walks through a door marked 'admittance only to authorized hospital staff'.}
<L>__{interior hospital locker room. morning}
<A>__{phil slips off his overcoat and stuffs it into the trash. he tosses away the unlit cigar, grabs a white coat from a hook and puts it on. he walks out through another door.}
<L>__{interior hospital corridor. morning}
<A>__{phil wanders down the corridor, glancing into rooms and checking signs. he pushes open a door marked 'pathology'.}
<L>__{interior hospital pathology lab. morning}
<A>__{the room is empty, except for a couple of covered bodies on trolleys. phil checks under the first sheet, and recoils at whatever it is which lies beneath.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{sheesh!}
<A>__{he walks over to the next gurney and lifts the sheet. he stares down at the body, visibly moved.}
<C>__{phil }
<D>__{hello buddy. how you been?}
<A>__{he stands for a moment, gripping the gurney and looking down at his friend. then he snaps out of it.}
<C>__{phil }
<D>__{well, i can't stand around here chatting with you all day. things to do...}
<A>__{he wheels the gurney towards the door.}
<L>__{interior hospital corridor. morning}
<A>__{phil wheels the gurney down the corridor towards the exit. a doctor in green scrubs approaches and glances down at a clipboard.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{naw, i'm cool thanks.}
<A>__{the doctor reads the tag on the body's toe.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{just taking some stiff down to neurology.}
<T>__{con tinue d:}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{we don't have a neurology department.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{urology.}
<A>__{the doctor grabs the end of the gurney. phil tugs and the doctor tugs back. after a moment, phil sighs and shakes his head in frustration.}
<C>__{phil }
<D>__{okay. just hold your horses i will go check the paperwork.}
<A>__{the doctor holds up his clipboard.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i have the paperwork.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{no. you have your paperwork. i need to go check my paperwork.}
<A>__{he slips through the exit. the doctor waits awkwardly for a few seconds, and then pushes open the door.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{hello? hello...}
<A>__{he glances around in surprise, but there is no one in sight.}
<L>__{exterior desert. morning}
<A>__{phil's trike accelerates as it approaches a t junction. to the right the sign points to 'joshua tree town', to the left 'los angeles'. the trike doesn't even slow as it skids left, sending a spray of sand and gravel flying across the road. nb. there will be several shots of phil driving through the desert, set to music.}
<L>__{exterior phil's street. day}
<A>__{the trike pulls up outside a rambling old house. two enormous plaster eagles flank the front door, a giant harley davidson sign hangs from the roof, and there's a six foot flashing neon star in the front window. phil gets out, walks up to the door and pulls some keys out of his pocket.}
<L>__{interior phil's sitting room. day}
<A>__{phil walks into the room and pours himself a drink. he slumps onto the couch, takes a sip and closes his eyes. we see movement behind him, as an attractive girl slips through a door and approaches phil from behind. this is susie, and she puts her hands over his eyes.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{guess who?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{martin luther king.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{try again...}
<A>__{susie leans over the back of the chair and gives phil a long slow kiss. she jumps over the couch and resumes kissing, this time more passionately. phil tries to pull away with little success.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{this.... ...isn't.... ...the best time... ...baby....}
<A>__{susie continues regardless, phil is now finding it hard to resist. he eventually gives in, and they begin to kiss passionately.}
<L>__{interior phil's kitchen. day}
<A>__{phil and susie are sitting at the kitchen table. he takes a drag from her cigarette and passes it back.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{god damn! i'm so sorry, baby.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{yeah, out of a job again.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{would never have happened if you were there.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{how do you know i wasn't?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{well, if you were, you wouldn't have let him die.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{i was still 'on staff'. he was still my responsibility.}
<T>__{con tinue d:}
<A>__{they sit quietly for a moment. then:}
<C>__{phil }
<D>__{so where have you been, anyway?}
<A>__{she sighs, and stands up.}
<C>__{phil }
<D>__{how long this time? two weeks?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{yeah, let's have this conversation again. like you haven't just done six weeks on the road...}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{yeah, but i usually leave a note. and there's a paycheck involved.}
<A>__{susie disappears through the door. phil's shoulders sag and he slumps against the wall. then susie reappears with a bottle of jack daniels and a couple of glasses. she pours out two generous measures and hands one to phil.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{come here...}
<A>__{after a moment, he gets up and follows her out of the room.}
<L>__{interior phil's sitting room. day}
<A>__{susie guides phil to a chair and sits him down.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{this is a remembrance.}
<A>__{she crosses to a record player and turns it on, pausing to let down the blind on the way back. 'in my hour of darkness'(or similar music) fills the room.}
<T>__{series of shots:}
<A>__{a) phil takes a drink. b) girl in tears to cam outside the joshua tree motel:}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(earnestly)}
<D>__{he was so beautiful, and he understood what my heart was feeling. i will...}
<P>__{(mor e)}
<T>__{con tinue d:}
<C>__{gir l }
<D>__{never laugh again. my inner joy has gone. it evaporated when gram departed.}
<A>__{c) music 'expert' on chat show}
<C>__{expert}
<D>__{he sang country music in a way that it had never been sung before. it was 'country rock', if you like. and it was kinda catchy. at least, the young people seemed to lap it up. it's fair to say that when gram parsons died, he died a star.}
<A>__{d) phil takes another drink. he may be crying. e) hippie to cam from a street in la:}
<C>__{hippie}
<D>__{it's like... i can't... it was real, kinda... i... oh, man.}
<A>__{f) phil sleeps, and the glass slips from his hand. g) reporter to cam from outside joshua tree hospital:}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{and another light burns out in the desert. gram parsons the standard bearer of the new country music movement is dead, following an overdose of drugs. while many of america's young people are today in mourning, their parents will view this as another example of how today's drug culture can so easily claim a life. we'll leave you tonight with the young man's own words. gram parsons wrote a song called 'in my hour of darkness', which contains these words: 'in my hour of darkness...'}
<A>__{we are back in phil's sitting room. fade up on the music, to match the reporter's words, as gram's voice fills the room: (or similar music).}
<C>__{gram's voice}
<D>__{in my hour of darkness, in my time of need, oh lord grant me vision, oh lord grant me speed. oh lord grant me vision, oh lord grant me speed.}
<T>__{con tinue d:}
<A>__{susie tenderly throws a blanket over the sleeping phil as the record ends. she turns the light off and the room goes dark.}
<L>__{interior phil's sitting room. day}
<A>__{susie walks in with a coffee. she sits beside phil and strokes his head until he wakes. she kisses him and passes him the cup.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{he sits up and stretches. she leans over to kiss him, then stands and starts to tidy. he watches her. she picks up some clothing from near his chair and moves away. he drops another piece of clothing on the same spot. she says nothing and picks it up. he takes a sock off and drops it. it has stopped being a game and started being a statement. she picks the sock up and drops it in his lap. he pushes it back onto the floor. she opens her arms and everything falls to the floor. she walks out of the room and into the kitchen. he follows.}
<L>__{interior phil's kitchen. day}
<A>__{susie leans on the table, staring out of the window. phil walks up behind her.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{when you're here, i spend my time wondering when you're going. and when you're back, i wonder where you've been.}
<A>__{she turns and walks round to face him.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{phil, you give me laughs and a great time. but i'm not sure if that's enough.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{you mean there's more than that?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{yes, there's more than that! there's dependable, responsible, reliable...}
<T>__{con tinue d:}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{there's dull, boring, normal. you should hook up with someone who works in a bank. i know a guy, actually. he has fish for dinner every friday, cleans his shoes twice a week and buys his ties in bulk because it works out cheaper that way. i will put you in touch.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{i don't mind loving a crazy bastard, phil. but you've got to be for something and not just against everything. you have to choose something to represent.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{i represent the combined forces of charm, enchantment and exuberance.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{your job is to arrange other people's lives. maybe it's time to put a little thought into your own.}
<A>__{susie walks out of the room.}
<L>__{exterior suburban street. day}
<A>__{a suburban street of small, neat bungalows. we move down the street, past house and identical house, until we rest outside another that is identical to the rest. the front door opens, and a nondescript man emerges, carrying a small overnight bag. he carefully locks the door and walks down the path to where a cab waits. we can clearly see 'new orleans taxi' marked on the door.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{airport, please.}
<A>__{this is stanley parsons, gram's father.}
<L>__{interior phil's sitting room. day}
<A>__{there is a loud banging on the front door. phil glances out of the window, and looks momentarily puzzled. he opens the door, and a beautiful woman stands on the step.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{long time, no see, barbara.}
<T>__{con tinue d:}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{don't try and schmooze me, kaufman, you repellent slimeball.}
<A>__{she notices susie standing behind phil.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{the latest victim?}
<A>__{barbara walks past them into the kitchen. susie looks quizzically at phil.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{meet barbara.}
<A>__{barbara calls out from the kitchen.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{it's a lot tidier than i remember.}
<A>__{susie raises an eyebrow at phil.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{who the hell is she?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{gram's ex girlfriend.}
<A>__{phil points at his temple as if to say she's nuts.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{girlfriend? isn't he married?}
<A>__{barbara walks back into the hall.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{welcome to the seventies.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{what do you want, barbara?}
<A>__{barbara lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i'm here to fulfill gram's wishes.}
<A>__{she waits for him to speak.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{that's nice. i have no idea what you're talking about.}
<A>__{she holds up an old piece of writing paper. con tinue d: (2)}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{do you know what this is?}
<A>__{phil reaches for it, but barbara snatches it away.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{it's gram's will.}
<A>__{she reads it out.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{to whom it may concern: i would like it to be known that it is my wish to leave barbara mansfield my assets and belongings in the event of my death. signed: ingram cecil parsons.}
<A>__{phil looks surprised.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{did he write that with joined up writing or was it before he knew how?}
<A>__{barbara gives a wry smile.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{still the jester kaufman, and still very unfunny.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{that's not a will barbara, and you know it.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{it's better than a will, actually. it's a signed promise from gram to leave me all his assets and belongings. and anyway, it's really none of your business what this is. i've come for the guitar.}
<A>__{phil shakes his head.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{guitar?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{yes. gram's guitar. he always kept it here.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{it's been a while since you were around, barbara.}
<P>__{(mor e)}
<A>__{con tinue d: (3)}
<C>__{phi l }
<D>__{gretchen, his wife, took it back six months ago.}
<A>__{barbara leans forward until their noses are almost touching.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i don't believe you, kaufman.}
<A>__{barbara pushes past phil who gives no resistance. she walks straight over to the couch and starts pulling up the cushions. susie moves to stop her, but phil holds her back and lets barbara carry on.}
<L>__{interior phil's lounge. day}
<A>__{phil and susie sit on the sofa, an island of calm in a sea of chaos. around them, the floor is covered with papers, clothing, empty record covers, torn open cushions and books. a broken drawer is propped against the table. a lampshade hangs crazily from its bearings, throwing strange shadows around the room. suddenly, susie gets up and kicks a cushion across the room.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{hey, well done. you found the only unbroken thing.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{why did you let her in?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{it's all part of the grieving process.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{how can she behave that way? gram's not even in the ground yet.}
<A>__{phil stares at her.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{he continues to look at her oddly.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{don't you freak out on me.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{do me a favor and get the guitar, sweetheart.}
<T>__{con tinue d:}
<A>__{he disappears into the kitchen.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{phil}
<P>__{(o.s)}
<D>__{i gotta make a call.}
<L>__{interior joshua tree funeral home. day}
<A>__{a man with glasses and an ill fitting black suit does some paperwork. he is surrounded by coffins displaying garish 'special offer' price tickets. the phone rings, and the undertaker takes his time answering it.}
<C>__{undertaker}
<D>__{afternoon. joshua tree obsequies.}
<L>__{interior phil's kitchen. day}
<A>__{phil is holding the phone. he frowns.}
<C>__{phil}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{obsequies? what the hell does that mean? i'm...}
<L>__{interior joshua tree funeral home. day}
<A>__{we hear the rest of phil's mutter from the phone in the undertaker's hand.}
<C>__{undertaker}
<D>__{it's latin. it means burial. is there anything i can help with? who am i speaking to?}
<L>__{interior phil's kitchen. day}
<A>__{phil straightens up. he speaks curtly.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{yes, you can help me as a matter of fact. i am...}
<L>__{interior joshua tree funeral home. day}
<A>__{again, we hear phil's voice trumpeting out of the phone. the undertaker changes his tone.}
<C>__{undertaker}
<D>__{mister parsons? i'm sorry, i will take a look immediately.}
<T>__{con tinue d:}
<A>__{he puts down the phone and flicks through a big book. he purses his lips. he wipes his nose with a white silk handkerchief. then he picks up the phone.}
<C>__{undertaker }
<D>__{yeah, he was here.}
<A>__{mutter.}
<C>__{undertaker }
<D>__{new orleans. although he only just went, so he'll still be on his way to los angeles airport. big thrill for us here, as we're only a small facility. nearly got jane mansfield in '67 when she passed through, but she got diverted to frisco. hello?}
<A>__{no mutter.}
<C>__{undertaker }
<D>__{hello. hellooo...}
<L>__{interior phil's kitchen. day}
<A>__{the phone sits on the table but the room is empty.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(o.s)}
<D>__{phil?}
<A>__{susie walks in, looks around, and leaves.}
<L>__{exterior phil's driveway. day}
<A>__{phil is lying down in the back of susie's station wagon, his feet sticking out of the back. susie comes out of the house carrying the guitar, and sits on the steps, where she watches him. after a minute:}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{these things aren't that big.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{okay. is that a problem?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{not really.}
<A>__{susie is confused.}
<T>__{con tinue d:}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{well, that's good.}
<A>__{no answer. phil continues to check out the inside of her car.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{so what are you up to?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{it's best you don't know.}
<A>__{without a word, susie gets up and walks into the house. phil lies still. after a moment, she reappears with her bag. she flounces theatrically past him and opens the car door. phil gets out of the back.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{i don't know what this madness is, but i'm not getting involved.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{well, that's the pointerior}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{i mean, i don't know what it is you're planning, but i'm not bailing you out again.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{i'm going.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{again.}
<A>__{she gets into the car and slams the door. she starts the engine, and phil stands back, but the car doesn't move. after a moment the window winds down.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{this time, i'm not coming back.}
<A>__{she gives him a 'so there' smile.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{i'm going to find a man who buys his ties in bulk.}
<A>__{she drives away.}
<L>__{exterior larry osterberg's home. day}
<A>__{phil arrives on his trike outside a small house.}
<L>__{interior larry osterberg's home. day}
<A>__{a man is sitting cross legged on the floor. a joss stick burns beside him, and sitar music plays in the background. this is larry osterberg, and he is meditating. there is a loud hammering on the door. larry shows no sign of having heard anything. more hammering at the door, but still no response. then the letter box creaks open and an eye appears in the slot. after a moment, the eye disappears and phil's face appears momentarily at the window. the window seems to be slightly higher than phil, so his face appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room.}
<C>__{phil}
<P>__{(o.s)}
<D>__{hello? anyone there?}
<A>__{then phil is gone. larry expels a big breath. the letterbox creaks opens again and the eye is back.}
<C>__{phil }

<C>__{phil }
<D>__{sorry barb, gotta go.}

<D>__{what seems like yin is often supported by yang, and vice versa. let me give you an example: to truly know good, you must first know evil, and without good as a comparison, nothing can be evil. so by allowing yin to flourish, you welcome yan. by letting go of yin, you are waiting for its return. another example is...}
<A>__{there is a crash, and the car slams to a halt. larry is thrown forward, but manages to grab the wheel. phil is not so lucky, and catapults into the dashboard, before being thrown back into his seat, the crumpled cigarette still gripped between his teeth.}

<A>__{there is a faint noise. larry hears it first and then phil and then, as they strain to identify it, they see a tiny dot on the road ahead of them, which grows and grows as they watch it, and they peer hard into the wind to identify it and... it's a motorcycle cop.}
<C>__{phil }

<C>__{phil}
<D>__{i don't know what about! ever since i met you, you've talked. yabba, yabba, yabba, every waking minute. religion, your supersonic, supercharged car, the darkside. now you need to talk, and you can't think of anything to say.}
<A>__{the cop slows down but drives past. phil waves at him.}
<C>__{phil }
<D>__{whatever your damn fool religion is called, i think it works.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{well... it's more a philosophy than a religion.}
<A>__{the cop does a u turn and motors towards them.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{oh, well done. good work.}
<A>__{he shoots a vicious look at larry. the cop parks his bike and removes his helmet.}

<A>__{the cop doesn't respond, just keeps looking at larry with a pleasant half smile on his face.}

<D>__{the reason i ask, is that you appear to have driven into one of our road signs.}

<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{motorcycle cop}

<D>__{hearse. flowers.}

<C>__{motorcycle cop}
<D>__{in the car, please.}
<A>__{phil opens the door and empty beer bottles cascade out into the road. they get into the car and the cop cuffs them together through the steering wheel and takes the car keys. then he walks back over to his bike and starts to talk into the radio.}

<A>__{phil treats the theoretical question with indifference. con tinue d: (2)}

<A>__{he has phil's attention now.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{okay. show me.}

<C>__{phil}
<D>__{yes, i think we should go.}
<A>__{larry starts the car. he throws it into reverse and the bumper slowly disengages from the metal signpost. suddenly the car tears loose and flies backwards, smashing into the cop's motorcycle, leaving him holding the radio and its trailing wire. larry slams on the brakes.}

<D>__{oh shit.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{nicely done.}

<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{you people are supposed to be on the lookout for a hearse. a hearse is a big long car. you can usually tell which ones are the hearses, because they have coffins in the back. the one we're looking for is painted yellow. does this look like a yellow hearse to you, asshole?}
<A>__{long pause. barbara realizes that she might have gone too far. he starts to write a ticket.}

<L>__{exterior desert. night}
<A>__{phil, larry and susie pick themselves up. they stare at the pyre. phil is close to tears, and susie puts her arm around him. for a moment, phil thinks he sees the flames morph into the shape of an angel over the burning coffin. the image disappears when larry speaks.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{maybe too much fuel.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{nah, i just didn't factor in the booze inside of him. gram always...}

<C>__{traffic cop}
<D>__{be my guest.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{we're in the desert. it is dark. if you want to catch someone in the dark, it's best not to turn on big flashing lights and make a loud noise with a siren.}
<C>__{traffic cop}
<D>__{do you want to know what i think, ma'am?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{no. but i'm really, really keen to find out.}

<L>__{exterior highway. day}

<C>__{phil}
<D>__{yeah. let's roll, hippie.}
