<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior mountain pass}
<A>__{the five race toward a rope bridge stretched between mountain peaks. tai lung appears at the other end of the bridge. he roars and races toward them.}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{cut it!}
<A>__{the others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the mountain. tai lung is almost upon them when tigress cuts the final rope. but tai lung is too close tigress must launch herself into him. the two cats end up in the middle of the bridge just as it starts to tumble into the canyon below. the five grab support ropes and hold on for dear life.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{where's the dragon warrior?}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{how do you know you're not looking at her?}
<A>__{tai lung laughs. it echoes off the mountain walls.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{you think i'm a fool? i know you're not the dragon warrior. none of you!}
<A>__{the five exchange quick, worried looks.}
<C>__{tai lung }
<P>__{(nodding confidently)}
<D>__{i heard how he fell out of the sky on a ball of fire, that he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen.}
<A>__{the five exchange quick, confused looks.}
<C>__{monkey}
<D>__{po?}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{so that is his name po. finally, a worthy opponent. our battle will be legendary!}
<A>__{tigress charges at him. the battle begins. tigress punches tai lung as he hangs from the bridge. but tai lung counters with a maneuver that sends tigress slamming backwards through the bridge's wooden slats. then tigress gets choked by the bridge's ropes. monkey turns to crane and viper.}
<C>__{monkey}
<D>__{we've got this. help her!}
<A>__{viper grabs tai lung, which causes him to let go of the ropes. tigress plummets down into the gorge... but crane manages to catch her. viper punches tai lung repeatedly with his own fist. tai lung manages to get a paw around viper's "throat".}
<C>__{viper}
<D>__{monkey!}
<A>__{angle on mantis and monkey. mantis is straining to hold the rope by himself.}
<C>__{mantis}
<D>__{go!}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{ack! what was i thinking?!}
<A>__{monkey leaps into action, kicking tai lung in the chest and sending him crashing through the slats of the bridge. he gets back to his feet and starts running back to them on a single strand of rope.}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{mantis!}
<A>__{mantis whips his end of the rope, sending a sine wave shooting toward tai lung. the rope whips tai lung in the face and he gets tangled up. the five see their chance.}
<C>__{tigress }
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{working as a team, the five kick tai lung's butt every which way. tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up tai lung. he plummets down... down... disappearing into the mist. mantis whips his end of the rope, returning his buddies safely to the mountain. the five look relieved. but the relief is short lived... tigress notices that the other end of the bridge is circling the far mountain peak. her eyes go wide with dread. the rope whips up. but tai lung isn't there. with a crash, he suddenly appears behind the five.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{shifu taught you well...}
<A>__{tai lung jabs a finger at monkey, who instantly freezes.}
<C>__{tai lung }
<D>__{but he didn't teach you everything.}
<A>__{tai lung lunges toward the rest.}
