<D>__{wolves movin' left to right on your radio dial. looking to generate some offense. they've been up and down the last few weeks.}
<A>__{angle on bobby collins in the huddle.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{28 thunder right. on go.}
<A>__{they break and the e.s.u. offense comes to the line. collins calls signals. we go to slow motion as he fades to pass. darnell fakes a block, then rolls out for a screen pass. georgia tech's defensive line comes hard. bobby flips the ball over the charging defenders. darnell catches it, gets a good block from bud lite, then tucks in behind ray who is out ahead blocking. there's only one linebacker to beat and darnell will be into the secondary. figuring ray will block the guy, darnell begins to look for the safeties. ray, however, barely brushes the linebacker, who doesn't even break stride. he lowers his head, and drives into darnell, his helmet hitting the football. fumble! there's a scramble. the yellow jackets free safety comes up with it.}
<B>__{regular speed}
<A>__{the crowd and the e.s.u. bench, quickly deflated, sit back down. darnell gets to his feet, glares at ray, but says nothing. he knows ray tanked the block.}
