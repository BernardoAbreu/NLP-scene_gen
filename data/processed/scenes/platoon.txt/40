<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{this ain't taylor. taylor been shot. this man chris been resurrected ...}
<A>__{chris wondering what he's doing here. his eyes roving over lerner, crawford, manny, flash, francis, hoyt, tubbs, doc, other from the platoon, about 9 or 10 of them. rhah eyes him back, hands him the bowl.}

<C>__{rhah}
<D>__{bah, you're a child, lerner. rhah don't waste time on you.}
<A>__{they go on ad libbing with each other, teasing doc, who's fairly straight, saying he wants to go to med school in the fall. 'be what?''a gynecologist, man.''what dat?' francis suggests, 'dats a pussy doctor, man he's gonna be doctor feelgood, man!' they're all cracking up, finding every joke funny. as chris finishes his hit on the pipe, looks up across the smoke, already dazed, surprised to see elias suddenly there leaning out of his sling in a far corner of the hooch. a monkey is draped around his neck with silver bracelets, rings, a necklace like a sensual little egyptian whore, elias playing with it, spaced out in a sleeveless vest, tiger pants. dancing eyes on chris, he swings out the hammock, comes over with the monkey. meanwhile manny has broken into a high falsetto snatch of blues directed at chris, joined by big harold and francis, all of them clicking their hands.}
<D>__{manny & big harold & doc oooh chris, you look like you is high oh yeah, he looks like he is high ooooh chris, you know you gonna be that way all night oh yeah i think that you are ... yeah! up now and up to par oh yeah.}

<D>__{yeah. no pain in my neck now. feels good.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{feelin' good's good enough.}
<A>__{as he sucks in a huge mass of smoke off the bowl. his eyes performing a funny little hop, skip and jump, as he holds it, his face turning red. the monkey jabbers and jumps around on his neck, worried. elias then blows the smoke out in its face, the monkey hating it. the group laughes.}
<C>__{elias }
<D>__{hey crutcher. i hear you got a dear john from your gal. told you she wasn't getting 'nuff from you.}
