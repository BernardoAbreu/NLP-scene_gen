<A>__{all money, no taste. in the foyer: a wilshire station six pack interviews the old biddie in a threadbare bathrobe. dyed orange hair and a burnt butter grin. leans lunges as she relays her story. i zoom in to catch the performance.}
<C>__{biddie}
<P>__{(mid sentence)}

<C>__{me}
<D>__{officer.}
<A>__{the six pack crosses to confer.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{besides bat shit insanity, is there anything else about her that rings true?}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{heard an argument, loud, maybe a minute or two, then silence.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{what's this `peeper' riff she's on?}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{she saw someone in the bushes earlier. she's reported that kind of thing a dozen other times. she's also reported flying saucers, so...}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{see if any of the other neighbors can verify this `peeper' thing.}
<A>__{roam. a hallway. junior the grim faced professional, he's got that damn steno out, scribbling like he's on a deadline.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{no one touch a thing `til i say.}
<A>__{he's hovering over a lake of blood, drag marks originating in that lake lead out to the garage. junior sees me. see him startle, then jut his tough guy chin on reflex:}
<C>__{junior stemmons }
<D>__{dave }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ lieutenant klein. i said `meet me' in twenty minutes' not `go in without me.'}

<D>__{all i've been doing }
<C>__{me}
<P>__{(hard harsh low)}
<D>__{ is stepping on dicks. you don't know the history, the players or the play.}
<A>__{pull junior aside, impart the following tightly:}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{the department gave magdalena a monopoly on the la dope trade decades ago }
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{ what department?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{us pollyanna lapd. we bullet proofed him in exchange for 60% of his profit and a promise he only deal drugs in darktown and east la }
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{ black and mexican }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ give the man a prize. he'd also rat his competition and kill the ones we couldn't convict. now keep your mouth shut and stay on my hip.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{i want to bounce his head off the wall. i continue my tour instead. follow the blood trail out into the garage where it ends in another smaller lake of blood.}
<C>__{junior stemmons }
<D>__{loaded him into a car }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ are all the magdalena vehicles accounted for?}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{except for the son's: tommy.}
<A>__{continue the tour. kitchen. two dobermans, shot dead. feature matching bullet wounds right between their eyes yell to the officer with the biddie:}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{officer.}
<A>__{as he pokes his head around the corner:}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{the old lady hear dogs barking? gunshots?}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{no, i asked. just the yelling.}
<A>__{examine the wounds closer. catch myself petting the deceased pooches. to junior:}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{she didn't hear barking...so they were either lousy guard dogs...or they knew the killer.}
<P>__{(point to the wounds)}
<D>__{you can't hit something this clean unless you're point blank. he could've been petting them when he fired: look at the burn pattern }
<P>__{(point)}
<D>__{like when you shoot something with a silencer.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{me}
<P>__{(stare so he gets it)}
<D>__{i've shot things with silencers... and the old lady didn't hear any gunshots.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{you make a family member for it? tommy?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{maybe...}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{do you want to issue an apb?}
