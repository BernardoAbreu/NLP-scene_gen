<L>__{interior supermarket stockroom day}
<A>__{dark and dusty, packed floor to ceiling with crates and palettes. offscreen, a soap opera plays on tv. ronna comes around the corner, a thundercloud of anger and frustration. she passes by claire (19) and the british simon (21) at the phone, sorting through a crumpled list. simon's eyes track ronna as she passes.}

<C>__{claire}
<D>__{she's been on for fourteen hours.}
<A>__{at her locker, ronna misdials the combination. frustrated, she pounds the locker, then re dials. simon approaches ronna gingerly. claire gives up on him, setting to work opening a box of expired cookies.}
