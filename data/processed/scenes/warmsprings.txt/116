<A>__{surrounded by peeling wallpaper and threadbare furniture eleanor and louis exchange glances.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{what exactly are you proposing, franklin?}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{that this will be the first polio rehabilitation and treatment center in the world. my personal trust almost covers the price of the inn and the surrounding land. there will be a modest tuition charged to the patients which should hold us over while i seek out investors.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{franklin, you're risking everything you have...}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{and there are other costs to consider.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{mama will see that the children are provided for.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{i'm not speaking of money.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i have found something here which makes waking up in the morning remotely bearable and the two of you stand there...}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{franklin, i need for you to be practical and realistic.}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{practical? i am trapped inside a body that no longer moves of my own volition. i am trying to be practical. now either you're with me or against me. in or out!}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{i don't care for ultimatums disguised as debate.}
<A>__{eleanor starts to leave.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{where are you going? eleanor! get back here.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{i will see you gentlemen tonight.}
<A>__{she leaves.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you can't talk to her like that.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{oh really? are you an expert on this now? how should i speak to my wife, louis?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{with the respect she deserves.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{look, i don't deny the work you're doing here could be important }
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{could be?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{the issue is whether you want to run a rehabilitation center or whether you want to run for office again.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{when i can walk, i will run.}
