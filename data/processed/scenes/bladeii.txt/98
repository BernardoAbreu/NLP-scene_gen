<L>__{exterior cityscape pre dawn}
<A>__{beyond the shadowed skyline of monolithic buildings, the night is beginning to give way to dawn.}
<L>__{interior scud's workshop pre dawn}
<A>__{scud stands before the others. he looks bleary eyed but pleased with the night's work. the fruit of their efforts are laid on a work table before them a half dozen uv laser guns, along with a collection of uv flashbang grenades and a much bigger explosive device secured into a backpack carrier. blade picks up one of the uv lasers. he sights down the length of it. scud takes a power pack and slaps into the base of blade's gun.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{the powerpacks have a limited charge, maybe ten minutes of continuous use at most.}
<A>__{nyssa gestures to the flashbang grenades.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{what are these?}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{uv flashbang grenades with plug in phosphor sticks }
<P>__{(pointing to a backpack carrier)}
<D>__{this is for the grand finale. wired together a couple dozen of those puppies. but i'd be careful where you pop your load. might end up frying yourselves in the process.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{what about you? you're not coming?}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{after last night? dude, i'm a lover, not a fighter.}
<A>__{asad looks to blade.}
<C>__{asad}
<D>__{what good is all this firepower if we don't know where they're hiding?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{we won't need to. they'll come to us.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{blade looks to nyssa, who tosses reinhardt an aerosol cannister. he sprays a little, then wrinkles his nose in disgust, gagging.}
<C>__{reinhardt }
<D>__{this is fucking foul!}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{they're pheromones. i infused them from that reaper's adrenal glands. all mammals use them to mark their territory. even vampires.}
<C>__{chupa}
<D>__{fuck that! i'm not spraying some gash hound's nut juice on me!}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{trust me, the reapers will key to it. if we use this, we'll draw them out.}
