<L>__{interior strip club night}
<A>__{puff, dressed a bit like he's a victorian dandy, sits in the front row and watches a naked woman on stage dancing. a topless cocktail waitress comes by with a fresh drink for him. she takes away his empty glass. he is horribly drunk and holding himself with exaggerated rigidity an amateur drinker's attempt to look sober.}

<C>__{lila}
<D>__{you were gone a long time.}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(sits down next to her)}
<D>__{yeah. puff and i got into a big, philosophical discussion. he's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. he's going to make us famous, lila.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{so he's doing okay?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{seemed fine. quiet evening enjoying his new digs.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{that's funny because, you know, i just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. he called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!}
<P>__{(then casually)}
<D>__{oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{shit.}

<D>__{and what did you do tonight, honey?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i fucked her! okay? i fucked her. i'm sorry. but that's what the hell i did.}

<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i gave up my soul, my beliefs. i gave up my body hair!}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{yeah, well, i'm sorry. the human heart is a strange thing.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{how the hell would you know anything about the human heart?}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(moving to her)}
<D>__{lila...}
<A>__{lila turns around and slugs him, square on the jaw, hard, knocking him to the floor.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{how's that for ladylike, nathan.}
<A>__{lila opens up the hall closet and pulls out a suitcase.}
