<L>__{interior exterior apartment 303 next moment}
<A>__{the puddle of blood, a trail leading under the door. the front wall window entrance of the next apartment down, still smoldering from fleury's grenade. no sounds, words. our team: fingers on triggers, weapons to shoulders, sights aligned. ten feet back. shoulders already flexed with tension, expecting a suicidal blast at any moment. janet grabs another grenade, moves to secure the hallway. intercut sykes outside. haytham on the stairs.}

<D>__{i think were about to find out, my friend.}
<A>__{fleury moves forward: i'm primary through the door. al ghazi's right with him. fleury gets three point stance low, hits the door like jim brown. scattered gunfire. fleury opens up in response. fleury never stops forward motion. stumbling headlong into a kitchenette, hard into a refrigerator and cabinets, firing the whole time. al ghazi blasting anything that looks like a body. straight mop up operation.}
