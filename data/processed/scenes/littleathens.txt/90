<A>__{heather walks over to the bed and starts rifling through the mess on the nightstand. she picks up a tube of astroglide and nonchalantly throws it on the bed.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{you're finally flipping, i think.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{you're a lot of help, ally. really. thanks.}
<A>__{heather opens the nightstand drawer and immediately pulls out a box of condoms, showing them to allison.}
<C>__{heather }
<D>__{see?! see?!}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{so what. condoms.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{ally, i'm on the fucking pill. he hasn't used condoms with me for weeks.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{so maybe those are left overs.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{ally, these are not left overs. he never used regular condoms with me.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(caught off guard)}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{because if he did, he took two fucking days to come. i always made him wear ultra thin, ribbed, anything but this shit.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{he took too long for you?}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{ally, i'd be done, and i'd have to lie there like another hour 'till he got off. i couldn't fucking stand it. why the hell do you think i started on the pill, ally? me. putting that hormone shit in my body.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{how would i know?}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{well that's why.}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{anyway, that's neither here nor fucking there. that asshole is using}
<P>__{(re condoms)}
<D>__{these things, and not on me.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{just call him and ask him.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{no, no, fuck that. we're going to go to the party, have some fun. when he's all good and drunk, you're going to ask him when i'm not around.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{yeah right.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{ally, i'm serious. if he's drunk and having fun, and you just work it in on him real casual, he may slip. he'll never admit shit to me.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{he won't to me either.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{ally! just fucking try it!}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{i don't wanna spy on him for you!}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{ally, look, he's cheating on me, i know it in my heart, but i want him to admit it, alright? before i fucking flush what's left of this shithole relationship down the toilet, i want him to admit it.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{fine, i will see.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{fine.}
