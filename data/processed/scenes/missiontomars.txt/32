<A>__{luke and willis turn, running as hard as they can towards the rover. but the suction is so great, it's as if they're held back by wires. the ground itself is shaking, rumbling, as earthquakes begin to open fissures across the plain. the roar of the vortex, the groaning of the earth, are like an onrushing freight train...}
<B>__{ahead of them}
<A>__{in the maelstrom of flying debris, they can barely make out cote and kirov, still retreating, leaning back with all their strength against the suction, while staring up, aghast. suddenly a hurtling rock, the size of a basketball, smashes into cote's helmet from behind, crushing it and killing her instantly. blood sprays into the wind, immediately crystallizing, in the sub zero atmosphere, into red pellets... luke, horrified, flings his arm up as bloody hail patters against his faceplate and forearm. an instant later he sees}

<A>__{snatched up by the wind, then swept past him, in a terrifying blur, arms and legs flailing, mouth open in a silent scream as he vanishes... the ground at luke's feet abruptly opens, and he slides into a fissure. scrabbling frantically with his gloved hands, he manages to momentarily arrest his fall, gripping the edge of the fault line, with his helmet and one elbow thrust over its lip. the air is almost solidly choked with debris, deadly boulders bound over him, and torrents of cascading sand are burying him alive...}
<B>__{close on luke}
<A>__{barely conscious, as he watches, for a horrifying final instant, as... his last crewman, willis is sucked bodily into the black maw of the vortex, spinning and tumbling like a rag doll... close on willis's face his features grotesquely distorted by the forces tearing at him, before suddenly his faceplate is sprayed with blood, and... distant angle luke's pov willis's spacesuit explodes, his entire body disintegrating into a million bits, which instantly disappear into the hellish maelstrom. and then that maelstrom itself, just as abruptly... stops. vanishes. there is an instant, ringing silence, as awesome in its own way as the roaring storm itself had been...}
<B>__{wide angle}
<A>__{on the plain, as the last pebbles, released from suction, pitter down, bouncing. swirls of dust and sand drift away, settling gently. the harsh orange landscape is once again calm, peaceful. and then, from the direction of the nearby mountain, we hear another sound: the deep bass pulsing rumble returns.}
