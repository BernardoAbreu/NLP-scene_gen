<L>__{exterior street. near school. day.}
<D>__{later. the cello is in the back seat of the bristol. jenny is trotting alongside the car, while david leans nonchalantly across the passenger seat to talk to her while driving.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm david, by the way. she says nothing.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and you are...?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{jenny. (beat) i've never seen a car like this before. c'est tres chic.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's a bristol. not many of `em made. jenny nods, but doesn't know how to respond.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{how did the concert go?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{it was a rehearsal. the concert's next thursday.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what are you playing?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(making a face)}
<D>__{elgar.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{ah, elgar. i often think it's a shame he spent so much time in worcester, don't you? worcester's too near birmingham. and you can hear that in the music. there's a horrible brummy accent in there, if you listen hard enough. jenny looks at him and smiles. she hadn't expected him to be able to make elgar jokes.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{anyway, i'm not sure elgar and jews mix very well.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i'm not a jew!}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{no. i am. i wasn't...accusing you.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh. (she smiles awkwardly.) can i sit in the car with my cello? david stops the car.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{jump in.}
