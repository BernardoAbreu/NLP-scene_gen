<L>__{147. interior interrogation room. tobruk. november 13,1942. day.}
<A>__{caravaggio is slumped at a table, his hands manacled to its thick wooden legs. there's a telephone at another table in the corner of the room attended by a clerk with a stenographer working next to him. the room has stone walls which appear damp, and no windows. soldiers stand guard at the door. it's a horrible room. caravaggio is trying to sleep, he's unshaven, and pasty looking. his interrogator, muller, seems incredibly tired and aggravated. he's on the phone.}
<C>__{muller}
<P>__{(in german)}
<D>__{yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.}
<A>__{he slams down the phone and comes back to the table.}
<C>__{muller}
<D>__{david caravaggio.}
<C>__{caravaggio}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{muller}
<D>__{petty thief, six months imprisonment kingston penitentiary, 1937.}
<C>__{caravaggio}
<P>__{(barely with humor)}
<D>__{i keep explaining. you've got the wrong man. my name is bellini antonio bellini. bellini, caravaggio, both painters, i think that is confusing you.}
<A>__{muller doesn't even pay attention, he's going through a file. pulls out some photographs, starts spreading them out.}
<C>__{muller}
<D>__{is this you?}
<C>__{caravaggio}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{muller}
<D>__{it is you. this was taken in cairo at british headquarters july 41. and so was this august 41. and this february 42.}
<C>__{caravaggio}
<D>__{it's impossible. i was buying or selling something. i've been to cairo many times.}
<C>__{muller}
<D>__{you are a canadian spy working for the allies. code name moose.}
<A>__{the phone rings again, is answered. the clerk calls to muller who gets up, irritably. caravaggio addresses the room.}
<C>__{caravaggio}
<D>__{could i have a doctor? i am passing blood. i must be bleeding internally.}
<P>__{(to the clerk)}
<D>__{can you get a doctor? look }
<P>__{(he spits onto the table,}
<A>__{there's blood in his mouth)}
<D>__{i'm leaking blood.}
<P>__{(he indicates a guard)}
<D>__{he kicks me. he kicks me all the time.}
<A>__{nobody responds. muller is irascible on the phone, checking his watch, negotiating time. the call finishes.}
<C>__{clerk}
<P>__{(in german)}
<D>__{he's asking for a doctor.}
<C>__{muller}
<P>__{(to caravaggio)}
<D>__{you want a doctor?}
<C>__{caravaggio}
<D>__{yes, i've been asking for weeks, a month, i don't know, also my leg was }
<C>__{muller}
<D>__{we don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.}
<C>__{caravaggio}
<D>__{a nurse? well, sure, a nurse is great. a nurse? great.}
<A>__{muller nods at the clerk, who instantly gets up. just then the telephone rings again. he hesitates.}
<C>__{muller}
<P>__{(in german)}
<D>__{leave it and get the nurse!}
<A>__{the clerk exits. the phone rings. the stenographer is plagued by flies. suddenly he slaps at one.}
<C>__{muller}
<P>__{(snapping)}
<D>__{why is there so much nose? i can't hear myself think!}
<P>__{(turns to caravaggio)}
<D>__{look give me something. so we can all get out of this room. a name. a code.}
<P>__{(wiping his face)}
<D>__{it's too hot.}
<C>__{caravaggio}
<D>__{i slept with the girl. i've got a wife in tripoli. a girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.}
<A>__{the nurse comes in. she is arab and her head is covered.}
<C>__{muller}
<D>__{i will tell you what i'm going to do. this is your nurse, by the way. she's moslem, so she'll understand all of this. what's the punishment for adultery? let's leave it at that. you're married and you were fucking another woman, so that's is it the hands that are cut off? or is that for stealing? does anyone know?}
<A>__{there's silence. muller turns to caravaggio.}
<C>__{muller}
<D>__{well, you must know. you were brought up libya, yes?}
<C>__{caravaggio}
<D>__{don't cut me.}
<C>__{muller}
<D>__{or was it toronto?}
<C>__{caravaggio}
<P>__{(ashen)}
<D>__{don't cut me. come on.}
<A>__{now the phone starts again. the clerk picks it up, there's a terse exchange, he puts the receiver on the desk, waits for the moment to interrupt muller.}
<C>__{muller}
<D>__{ten fingers. how about this? you give me a name for every finger doesn't matter who. i get something, you keep something. i'm trying to be reasonable. fenelon barnes, we could call that two names.}
<P>__{(pauses, suddenly puzzled)}
<D>__{are thumbs fingers?}
<P>__{(in german to the others)}
<D>__{is a thumb a finger?}
<A>__{no response. muller opens his palms to caravaggio.}
<C>__{muller}
<D>__{i get no help from these people.}
<C>__{clerk}
<P>__{(in german)}
<D>__{the telephone }
<A>__{muller walks over, takes the receiver and slams it down. an air raid siren is going off somewhere, and now the faint sound of explosions is also discernible, but all muffled in this room with the steady clack clack of the stenographer. at that moment, muller suddenly becomes aware of what is happening. he turns on the stenographer.}
<C>__{muller}
<P>__{(in german)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{stenographer}
<P>__{(awkward, in german)}
<D>__{that geneva convention. i'm muller peremptorily rips out the paper, throws it on the floor.}
<C>__{caravaggio}
<D>__{you can't do that! hey come on!}
<A>__{during this muller's gone to the table, pulled out a drawer and produced a cut throat razor. he hands it to the nurse, makes a line across his own left thumb and jerks his head towards caravaggio. the nurse is extremely reluctant. muller claps his hands, pushes her towards caravaggio.}
<C>__{muller}
<D>__{go! hey! go!}
<A>__{caravaggio is in terror.}
<C>__{caravaggio}
<D>__{oh jesus. oh jesus christ.}
<A>__{the guards come away from the door and press down on caravaggio's shoulders to prevent him from moving. the nurse, grim faced, approaches, kneels at the table.}
<C>__{caravaggio}
<P>__{(as she prepares to cut)}
<D>__{listen, i will give you a name. what name did you say? i knew them! i promise. please please!}
<A>__{and then he screams and screams and jerks up, carrying the guards and the table with him, all heaving off the ground, the nurse thrown off balance. he falls to the floor, roaring with pain, blood everywhere, the table on top of him. the air raid is continuing outside, the phone is ringing, the nurse stands, pale, blood all over her uniform.}
<C>__{muller}
<D>__{cut the other thumb.}
<A>__{he stabs at his own right thumb.}
<C>__{muller}
<D>__{this one! come on!}
<A>__{the nurse, horrified, shakes her head. muller snatches the razor from her and heads towards the prostate caravaggio. one guard has got to his feet and grips caravaggio around the neck in half nelson, others holding his legs, while muller approaches. caravaggio can't move. he's gurgling as the guard almost strangles him. his eyes are streaming with tears. now muller is at his other hand, and the roar of pain again lifts caravaggio to his feet, the whole table rising in the air, his mutilated hands slipping from the handcuffs lie houdini, the drawers of the table spilling their contents everywhere, before he sinks to his knees like a gored bull and blacks out.}
