<L>__{exterior grounds below tudor's balcony night}
<A>__{two elderly women, vi and olive, are taking a leisurely evening stroll at the base of tudor's tower. they both hold small transparent umbrellas over their heads and walk gingerly along the path bordering the lawn. suddenly the liquid, fleshy thwack of the parasite vomited by tudor from high above hitting one of the umbrellas is heard. a large splotch of blood spatters the first lady's umbrella just off center, as though it has been hit by a heavy, blood soaked sponge. the force of the blow almost twists the umbrella from the first lady's frail hand, and she gives a little cry of surprise. her companion extends a hand to help the first lady keep her balance, then gives a slightly more startled cry when she sees the blood. the first lady examines her umbrella as well, but does not react with such surprise.}

<D>__{aw. poor birdie. they're always crashing into tall buildings. it's such a shame, such a shame. the windows fool them, you know.}
<A>__{the creature, the second parasite to emerge from tudor's body, lies in the grass, away from the bright cones of light thrown by the tower's lawn lamps. we can barely make out its bloody, twitching form. beyond the parasite is a basement window through which is visible a large laundry room complete with washers and dryers. the window has been propped open a couple of inches by a bar of laundry soap. the first lady makes a move to find the injured creature, but her companion tightens her grip on the old lady's arm.}

<D>__{come along, olive.}
<C>__{first lady}
<D>__{oh, vi! maybe the poor thing's just been hurt. maybe we should look for him!}
<C>__{companion}
<P>__{(pulling olive along)}
<D>__{don't be silly, dear. it's in heaven now, whatever it is. won't help at all for you to get into a fuss and muddle over it. now come along and let's finish up our little evening stroll and get you tucked up in bed in front of the color tv.}
<A>__{the two women walk off down the path, vi's voice fading away in the shadows.}
<C>__{companion}
<D>__{you know what a restless night you have if you don't get your two hours of color tv, dear, so let's bustle along and get our walk over with, shall we...?}
