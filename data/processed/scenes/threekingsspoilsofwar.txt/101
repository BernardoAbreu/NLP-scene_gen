<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior shi'ite camp later}
<A>__{the mounted arabs lead epps and jaeger, hands tied before them and almost literally being towed by the horses, into their camp. it is similar to the shi'ite camps we've seen before with several tent dwellings. as the party enters groups of shi'ites come over to stare at epps and jaeger. they chatter amongst themselves, but our boys have no idea what they're talking about, and that just makes things all the scarier. from our boy's point of view this is all like an unending nightmare: being dragged along through a desert, not knowing the language, not knowing what's going to happen. their world skews and slides as if they were on a tilt a whirl. finally they reach a tent. one of the arabs tosses epps and jaeger's packs on the ground just before it. another cuts them loose and shoves them inside the tent, then yells something at them in arabic. he leaves, and our two are alone.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what do you make of them?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{shi'ites, i think.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{is that good, or bad?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i don't know. they killed wes.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{why haven't they killed us!?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i don't know!}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{...maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{with what? against how many?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{we can't just sit here waiting to die.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you come up with a better plan, let me know.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. if we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.}
<A>__{from o.c. we hear a voice:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i always knew you were a bitch.}
<A>__{epps and jaeger's hearts seize up and stop. it's as if they've heard the voice of a ghost, and they have. it's wes! he carries with him the pack of gold. epps can barely get his name out.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{...wes...?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you were shot. we were standing right there, you were shot!}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{in the flack jacket. still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. took the air right out of me, but i was just unconscious for awhile. 'course, you didn't stick around to find that out. you left me for dead.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we thought }
<A>__{like a guy who just took two steps over the edge:}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you left me for dead!}
<A>__{ohhh, shit. somebody's crazy. epps gets the feeling there's not going to be much dialog going on here. wes gets real calm again, which is almost as scary as him acting nuts.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{when my shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an american they were very apologetic. turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war. they figure we've finally gotten saddam off their backs. they brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... i'm their new best buddy. america number one, joe. but there's something the shi'ites can't figure out: they can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow americans, left me out in the desert. they can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an iraqi outpost. it's almost as if they were iraqi spies, or something. and i've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the iraqis. see how i mean?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{we had to take shelter in the checkpointerior jesus, wes, i killed the iraqis in there.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you actually got around to killing someone. i'm impressed. i guess you're only half a bitch.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were nexterior hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{sure, and i guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{wes }
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{look, i know you guys are telling the truth. it's just the shi'ites don't know that. i guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?}
<A>__{wes gets right up into jaeger's face.}
<P>__{wes{cont)}
<D>__{do you!?}
<A>__{of course wes knows they don't. he allows himself a very sweet, shit eating grin.}
<P>__{wes{cont)}
<D>__{they're going to kill you slow. i will see to that.}
<A>__{he steps away and starts to open the pack of gold.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{thanks for taking care of this for me.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{tell me something, wes. are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid? jaeger says you're crazy.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i didn't say that. i never said }
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{me? i say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.}
<A>__{for a second wes is taken by surprise by the statement, but he smiles at epps' boldness. he sets down the pack of gold and gets right up into epps' face.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you disappoint me, epps. always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy. i had respect for you.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{that why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{that's just what things came to. sometimes you can't help that. it doesn't change me respecting you. and now you let me down. i expected more from you, you know? i really did. i expected you to }
<B>__{a knife slides up into frame until the the tip rests just}
<A>__{under wes' throat, choking off his words. now it's epps' turn to go smug.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you expect this?}
<A>__{wes' got nothing to say. to jaeger:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{get the gold!}
<A>__{jaeger grabs up the pack.}
<C>__{epps}
<P>__{(to wes)}
<D>__{now let's try things another way. let's try this: you and me and jaeger are going to walk out of here. we're going to walk out all smiling and friendly so your little shi'ite buddies won't suspect a thing. then we're going to hop on some horses, and ride away, and live happily ever after. it's all going to happen just like that, because if it doesn't then i'm going to gut you like a fat pig. you understand me...soldier?}
<A>__{wes says nothing.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i will take that as a yes.}
<A>__{epps gruffly spins wes around and presses the knife up against his back so that it is hidden. epps marches wes outside the tent, stopping momentarily to grab up his pack with his free hand. to jaeger he says:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{get the water.}
<A>__{jaeger does as he's told.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{they'll kill you. you won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you don't know john epps very well, do you?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{can you ride a horse?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{no, but i figure now's a real good time to start.}
<A>__{they walk on through the camp towards some saddled horses. they pass a shi'ite who says something to wes in arabic. epps gives wes a poke in the back with the knife.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{don't say anything.}
<A>__{the shi'ite, obviously expecting an answer, says whatever it was he said again.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{just keep quiet.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i have to answer him.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{so you can give us away?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{if i don't answer, he'll know something's up.}
<A>__{epps gives this a lot of thought in a very short time.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you answer him, but you answer him wrong and you're going to be staring at your insides while you're dying.}
<A>__{wes very calmly says something to the shi'ite. the shi'ite just stands there for a beat looking at the three men, then suddenly explodes in screams. no way of knowing for sure what he's saying, but since he's going off like a westec alarm it's a pretty good bet he's been tipped of. epps rears back a fist and slams it into wes' face.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{bastard!}
<A>__{epps and jaeger take off running for the horses, practically leaping into the saddles as shi'ites come pouring out of their tents. forgetting himself, wes screams in english.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{stop them!}
<A>__{jaeger and epps spur their horses and take off riding hard. it's amazing what you can do when a bunch of angry shi'ites are chasing you. wes grabs an assault weapon from a near by shi'ite and mounts up with blood in his eyes. he leads a charge of armed, mounted shi'ites that looks like a posse going after some bad men. out front epps and jaeger pull up for a second.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{they coming?}
<A>__{epps takes a look behind him. he can't hardly miss the sandstorm wes and the shi'ites kick up as they ride for them.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{oh, yeah. they're coming.}
<A>__{epps points off to some foothills in the distance. it's the only thing close to cover for miles around.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{ride for the hills. we'll try to lose them.}
<A>__{they take the reigns to their horses and get to riding. behind them wes yells to his riders, and signals for them to split up, and try to cut off epps and jaeger. epps and jaeger hit the hills. they ride up for a bit, then stop to spot wes. wes and his crew are better riders and have closed the gap. all the two can do now is try to lose them in the terrain. epps and jaeger ride as best they can, and somewhat erratically to cover their trail. they head up a ways, then cut across in a parallel direction. jaeger looks back, but sees no sign of wes.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{we lost them!}
<A>__{just as the words leave jaeger's mouth a hail of bullets explodes the ground before them. their horses rear up, and it's all they can do to fight them. just ahead are the shi'ites who split off from wes, having circled around epps and jaeger. the two yank their horses back, and ride hard in the opposite direction with the shi'ites just behind. they fire on epps and jaeger, the bullets pinging off the rocks all around them. epps and jaeger are little more than passengers on their horses as they run wild like stampeding mustangs. and good for it, too, otherwise they might be dead by now. they break for a trail that leads further up the mountain, but it does little to shake loose their pursuers. as epps and jaeger level out they can see the trail below them, and wes and his posse riding for them. our two start back the way they came. but the other shi'ites crest the hill.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{which way?}
<A>__{epps looks from side to side. either way is certain death. then he looks off towards an embankment. it is very steep. very treacherous. it would take an expert rider to make it down the embankment safely. all epps knows is there aren't any gun totting shi'ites in that direction.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{which way do we go!?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we go this way.}
<A>__{fear gives way to desperation. both men whip their steeds hard. the beasts leap to the embankment and start the wild ride down. both epps and jaeger have to lean back in their saddles until they're almost parallel to the ground just to stay on their horses. wes sees this and swears. he signals to his men to cut back the other way. epps reaches the bottom of the embankment. jaeger is almost there when he looses control of his horse. both rider and animal go tumbling in an ugly fall.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{jaeger!}
<A>__{the horse gets up and bolts off before jaeger can get to her. just then wes and his men make it back down the trail, and start riding hard for jaeger. epps pulls his horse around and takes off for his fallen comrade. as he rides in he leans to the side and low. stretching out an arm epps literally scoops jaeger, and swings him up behind him. a couple of rodeo performers couldn't have done it better. problem is with the extra weight they can't go very fast. wes and his men close hard now. the bullets fly fast and furious swarming all around our boys. epps whips the horse, trying to get everything she's got to give. this is it: they get away now, or not at all. their horse finds a little something extra. she goes faster, faster... suddenly epps pulls up hard on the reins. the horse rears up, she goes wild. it takes everything epps has to control her. but better that than if she'd taken another stride. they've come to the edge of a very, very sharp cliff. epps may be a good rider for a novice, but no way he could get this beast to fly. finally he calms the horse down, but it doesn't matter. wes and the shi'ites ride up behind them cutting them off. wes stands down from his horse. epps and jaeger, with nowhere to go, do the same.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{the gold; give it to me.}
<A>__{epps takes the pack from jaeger, but doesn't throw it to wes.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{give it to me!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{if i give it to you, will you let us go?}
<A>__{wes smiles and lies so badly he doesn't even bother trying to fake it.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{sure. whatever you want. for old time sake.}
<A>__{epps has got no choice, really. he tosses the pack to wes' feet who stoops to pick it up. wes starts to open the pack.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, epps? like i said; i expected more from you.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's like i said; you don't really know lieutenant john epps very well, do you?}
<A>__{wes rips open the pack. he's got about one second to see what's inside. no gold. just a booby trapped claymore mine. epps grabs jaeger and yanks to him to the ground. there is a horrific furry of sound and fire that easily destroys wes and a few of the shi'ite standing next to him. the rest, along with the horses, scatter for dear life. epps stays down until the coast is clear, then gets up. jaeger, to say the least, is stunned.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{damn it. we lost the horses.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{the...the gold...}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it wasn't the gold. it was the claymore mine. the gold's in my pack.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{when did you make the switch?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's always been like that. when you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up i figured i'd better...take precautions. i rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack. just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{but...}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we had a deal. no one touches the gold until we're out of here. no one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what if it hadn't been wes? what if...i mean, accidently, what if i had...}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you shouldn't think about things like that. it'll just make you crazy.}
<A>__{we hold on the two men, on the smoking remains of wes. we hold on them, then:}
