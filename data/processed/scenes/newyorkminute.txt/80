<D>__{are you a lying sack, or what?}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{what was i supposed to do? i liked you. if i'd sent a real picture, would you have met me?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{that's not the pointerior}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{that means no. at least this way i got to see you before you blow me off.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no one is blowing you off, warren. as a matter of fact, we're very happy to see you, aren't we, parker?}

<D>__{not a twin, huh?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{that's a joke.}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{yeah, well. i guess everybody would like the world to see them a little bit differently than they are.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(quickly interjecting)}
<D>__{super. now that that's all settled, is there a restroom i can get to without going out there?}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{what's wrong with going out there?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{police, for one thing.}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{police? i thought you guys were joking.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{it's the kind of joke that will be a lot funnier a few years from now.}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{well that door's the only way out. there's a restroom at the end of the main hall.}
<A>__{parker opens the office door, peeking out.}
<C>__{drew}
