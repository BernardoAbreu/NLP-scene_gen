<A>__{it's packed. every square inch is filled with glittery hollywood vips. people make chit chat... but there is a squeamish excitement in the air. a brooding unease. nobody knows what to expect. suddenly the lights go black. a booming announcer.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen! please put your hands together for... tony clifton!}
<A>__{the theme from 2001 starts playing. "daaaaa, daaaaa, daaaaa! da daaaaa"! a small spot appears on a peach tuxedo. the light grows bigger, bigger... the tension magnifying... people gasping... our view widening... until tony clifton is revealed onstage! it's an extraordinary theatrical moment without response. the crowd has no idea what to do. tony smirks.}
<C>__{tony clifton}
<D>__{how ya doin'?}
<A>__{dead silence. tony struts downstage. he waves to the crowd.}
<C>__{tony clifton }
<D>__{how you doin' back there?!}
<P>__{(to the front rows)}
<D>__{how you doin' up here?!}
<A>__{still no response. until a lone reckless voice.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{andy!}
<A>__{whoa. the crowd rustles nervously. tony grimaces.}
<C>__{tony clifton}
<D>__{don't know nothin' about no andy. just some dead guy tryin' to ride my coattails.}
<P>__{(to the band)}
<D>__{let's hit it, boys! one, two, anda one two three four!}
<A>__{the band kicks in with disco anthem "i will survive." tony starts singing the schmaltzy opening:}
<C>__{tony clifton }
<D>__{"first i was afraid i was petrified. kept thinkin' i could never live without you at my side."}
<P>__{(he wipes away a pretend tear)}
<D>__{"were you the one that tried to hurt me with goodbye? did you think i'd crumble? did you think i'd lay down and die...?"}
<A>__{we pan the room full of enthralled spectators. at a front table are george and lynne. tony attacks the chorus.}
<C>__{tony clifton }
<D>__{"oh no not i! i will survive! as long as i know how to love, i know i will simply stay alive!"}
<A>__{in the crowd, we pass face after face smiling... frowning... intrigued... confused... until we settle on a man in the very last row. bob zmuda. enjoying the show more than anyone.}
<C>__{tony clifton }
<D>__{"i've got all my life to live i've got all my life to give. i will survive..."}
<P>__{(he hits his big finish)}
<D>__{"i will survive!!!"}
<A>__{the music crescendos, and the song ends. zmuda grins and applauds proudly.}
<T>__{fade out:}
<B>__{the end}
