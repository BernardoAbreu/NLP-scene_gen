<L>__{interior valentine's house. downstairs. afternoon.}
<A>__{valentine is talking to adhara, who is introducing her girlfriend. as valentine greets her, he glances outside where gordon is approaching wilson on the deck.}
<L>__{exterior deck.}
<A>__{wilson sees gordon approaching. gets ready to greet him. removes cigarette from mouth, drops it to floor of deck, presses it out under his shoe. limbers up his shoulders in a subtle way. gordon coming towards him. as if to challenge wilson's legitimacy as an invited guest. closer. about to speak. but wilson doesn't even give him a chance to do that. in quick succession: wilson head butts gordon, splintering his nose; knees him in the groin; then, using the knee for leverage, grabs gordon by the lapels and heaves him over the railing! it happened so fast that if anyone else is nearby they probably didn't even notice or didn't readily grasp what they saw.}
