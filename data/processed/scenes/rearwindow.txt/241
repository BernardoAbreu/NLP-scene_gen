<A>__{we are now given a waist high shot as the focus is adjustment by jeff. the figure is that of miss lonely hearts. she seems to be trying to figure out what to do, or where to go. she nervously looks at a couple of men passers by. getting no reaction, she crosses the street, and seats herself at an empty table in front of the cafe. she orders a drink. she is suddenly blotted out by a figure of a man who enters the picture from the left side. he is much nearer the lens, because he is on this side of the street. he is, therefore, slightly out of focus. the lens suddenly sharpens. it is thorwald, carrying a light weight cardboard box under his arm. the camera pans him over to the right until he is lost behind the building.}
