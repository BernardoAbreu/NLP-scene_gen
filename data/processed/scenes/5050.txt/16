<A>__{seth (25), pulls up in front of adam's house in his white neon and honks the horn. on the bumper is a sticker: "let's put the christ back in christmas." overweight, well dressed, and wearing an air of confidence, seth pulls out a massive joint, lights it and takes a hit. just then seth looks over at 3 young school children and their mother waiting for the school bus. the mother's jaw is on the ground in shock. seth hides the joint and smiles in embarrassment.}

<D>__{hi kids. beautiful day isn't it?}
<A>__{the mother quickly moves her kids out of sight. adam approaches seth's car. he spots his neighbors andrew and missy donnelly (late 40's) getting into their car. they wave to adam.}

<D>__{hey andrew.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{sorry about the noise last night.}
