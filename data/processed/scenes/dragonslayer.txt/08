<T>__{dissolve:}
<A>__{forest path day galen and hodge trudge along an overgrown cart track under an arch of trees.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{oh, it's a vale of tears in which we dwell. it doesn't matter who you are, a king in his robes, a peasant in his rags, when your time comes, no magic can save you...}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i guess...}
<A>__{the apprentice's mind is elsewhere: he's got a coin hovering in mid air above his palm, bobbing gently as he walks.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{...the kindest lord a man could ask for... now he's gone. ye gods he was fussy about his bath. and you'd think he could boil his own eggs with the snap of a finger, but no, he had old hodge do it, of course.}
<P>__{(snurfling)}
<D>__{up before five i was, mucking out the cages, slopping the pigs, and never once got so much as a thankyou or a pat on the back...}
<P>__{(through tears)}
<D>__{i'm going to miss him.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{me too...}
<A>__{he plucks a low hanging leaf, waves a hand over it, and watches it turn into a spray of daffodils.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{no you don't. all you care about is the tricks and knavery. well, you don't pull any wool over these old eyes. it'll be a mighty long walk before you fill his shoes, you mark my word.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{what's the matter, hodge, pack too heavy? here.}
<A>__{he gives the pack a slap. it flies out of its harness and floats alongside them. hodge snatches it back and clutches it tightly.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{careful with that!}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{too cold, is it?}
<A>__{a great coat drapes itself over hodge's shoulders.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{stop it!}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{too warm?}
<A>__{the greatcoat disappears, as do the rest of his garments, leaving him in his smalls.}
<C>__{hodge}
<P>__{(spluttering)}
<D>__{stop it, i say! out of respect for the master!}
<A>__{suppressing a grin, galen mercifully waves his hand and restores hodge to his usual costume.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i've got as much respect for the master as anyone, old man. but then again, i'm master now.}
