<A>__{prosperity is clearly visible just a mile away. the police car drives down a long road lined with fences.}
<L>__{exterior wade's ranch ranch house day}
<A>__{wade's new hummer is in the driveway. a cattle dog barks as wade leads sam and mike around the side of the house.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{came out to feed my birds this morning.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{coyotes?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{hell no!}
<A>__{the trio steps to the fence. only three mangy ostriches are there to greet them.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{my flock had fifty birds! where'd they go, dammit! who the hell steals fifty birds that can't even fly!?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{all this happened last night?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{i guess. and we didn't hear a thing.}
<A>__{sam gestures toward the barking dog.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what about him?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{not a peep.}
<A>__{mike notices some ostrich feathers on the ground. he heads over for a closer look. the dog watches his progress. barking excitedly. sam talks to wade.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{how's the ostrich business?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{not so good lately.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you've got that new hummer. you must be makin' enough to pay for it.}
<C>__{wade}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{you like it? i will take you for a ride.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{these birds are insured. right?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{i didn't kill my birds, sam. is that what you think?}
<A>__{mike looks back to see his mom confronting wade.}
<C>__{wade}
<P>__{(in the distance)}
<D>__{... reject... absolutely not...}
<A>__{mike scrutinizes what appear to be more of those tracks that he found at joshua's. but this time they are larger:}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(into pda)}
<D>__{i've found more tracks. even larger now.}
<A>__{mike follows the trail toward another mine entrance. this one is plugged with concrete. the tracks don't go there. they stop at what appears to be a normal patch of ground. several ostrich feathers are scattered nearby. mike takes a closer look. something doesn't seem right. an odd demarcation in the soil. his fingers trace the edge of a thin film of material. it is a lid of sorts. a sheath of sticky webbing coated with dirt. mike is able to lift it. mike peers into a deep dark burrow three feet wide.}
