<L>__{interior headmistress's office. day}
<D>__{jenny has put on her school uniform for this meeting; it completes a circle. she's back where she started from, or would like to be, anyway. if she seems older than she did when we first met her, it's because things have happened to her, and they've left a mark on her face. she's worried and tired. the headmistress, meanwhile, is delighted by her return but only because of the opportunities for smugness and schadenfreude it provides.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{so. your jewish friend turned out to be married already, i understand. how unfortunate. jenny doesn't say anything. she has clearly decided to swallow anything she has to.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{anyway. how do you think we can help?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i'd like to repeat my last year at school. start all over again.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{i got the impression the last time we spoke that you didn't see the point of school. or of me, or of any of us here.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i know. i was stupid.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{so what is the point?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i know that i need to go to university.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{and what happens if some other chap wants to marry you during your studies next year?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(laughing bitterly)}
<D>__{some other chap? there won't be any other chaps. not for a long, long time, anyway.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{i'm afraid i think you're the sort of young lady who attracts chaps whether she wants to or not. no,i think the offer of a place at this school would be wasted on you. you showed how little you valued us only weeks ago. and i must confess that it gives me a sort of grim satisfaction to return the sentiment now.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{is it really so grim, your satisfaction?}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{it gives me no pleasure to see our schoolgirls throw their lives away. although, of course, you're not one of our schoolgirls any more. through your own volition.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i suppose you think i'm a ruined woman.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{oh, you're not a woman. beat. jenny stands up and leaves without saying a word. the headmistress is pleased with her final line.}
