<ACTION>__{A glimpse of sunlight desperately tries to force its way through a gray sky before being obliterated. A MAN, sunburned and bearded, lets himself fall from the edge of a boat and into the ocean. UNDERWATER, through shafts of light, white limbs are FLAILING. The MAN struggles, alone. Bubbles stream upward. He breaks the surface and gasps for air. He begins to swim. His massive arms and shoulders grab at the tide in large, hard strokes. His legs and feet are buried beneath the dark ocean water.}

<ACTION>__{The crane swings around with the MAN in the net. He is EMPTIED out onto the deck like a fish. AHIVERING on the rotting wooden planks he FLIPS himself over on his stomach. Slowly, using the palms of his hands, he DRAGS his trunk and withered limbs across the deck in a labored lobster-walk. He uses his chest muscles to swing his legs around the edge of the boat. They dangle like pieces of rope, his feet white and flaccid. A towel, a bottle and a glass are wordlessly placed next to him by a CREW PERSON. He pours himself a generous amount of scotch and begins drinking.}

Though the light is dim it is clear that he is clean shaven, with his hair neatly trimmed. Their connection is powerful and alive. They stop dancing, overwhelmed with mutual desire. He holds the WOMAN's face in his hands and KISSES it all over, moving into a realm of feeling that is foreign to him. He kisses her passionately on the mouth.}
