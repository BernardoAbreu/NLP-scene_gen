<L>__{interior office day}
<A>__{she enters a comfortable office, many shelves, books, couch and chairs, big desk. she hears the man's voice from an anteroom. he's coming toward her.}
<C>__{pindella }
<D>__{excuse me that's a private entrance...}
<A>__{he sees her now, sees the uniform.}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{oh... is there a problem?}
<A>__{he's calm, gentle in the eyes. she stares a moment, trying to keep her emotions undercover.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i'm not sure. who am i speaking to?}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{i'm dr. pindella.}
<A>__{she takes her time, afraid.}

<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{do you know a catch lambert?}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{oh. yes! is he in trouble?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i... need to talk to you.}
<A>__{he glances at his watch, worried for catch.}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{well, i have a patient in five minutes. but i can...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{are you a...?}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{i'm a psychiatrist.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{and mr. lambert...}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{my relationship with mr. lambert is confidential.}
<A>__{she's dying inside but covering, lying, forcing her way into this.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{he's your patient. he's your patient we... know all this. this is police business. i'm officer sharon pogue l.a.p.d.}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{look... i want to help mr. lambert but i can't tell you anything that isn't public record.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{in general. in general. he's your patient, and he...}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{he's not my patient. he walked away from treatment. that was... nearly a year ago.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{why did he walk away?}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{i can't discuss that, but if you know how to reach him, i would appreciate being able to talk to him.}
<C>__{sharon}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{you can help by just telling me what's in the public record. it'll take me half a day to do a search. can you tell me? just...}
<A>__{she is unable to play this out as a "cop," her emotions coming through. pindella sees this. she sits on the edge of a chair and takes a breath, speaks more softly.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{can you please tell me what's in the record?}
<A>__{he stares a moment, sympathetic and realizing...}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{you were with him in the car. your uniform threw me. are you his friend?}
<A>__{she looks at him, nods.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{more.}
<A>__{he takes that in, leans back on the desk.}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{i can tell you he was in an accident, hospitalized, referred to me as an outpatient...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{what accident?}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{a bus... a city bus hit his vehicle. that was a couple of years ago. it was... an awful thing. his family was in the van. his wife and child. his wife's parents...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{a bus... and a van. where? on... the freeway?}
<A>__{something is pulling at her memory. her vision turns inward, and she stops breathing for a moment remembering. she was there. and here we get a... flashback carnage a glimpse of the carnage what she saw, first on the scene with catch lying there. all the while pindella is speaking.}
<C>__{pindella }
<D>__{i think so. yes. near santa monica. on the freeway. he was severely injured but... thrown clear. the others were trapped in the van.}
<A>__{back to sharon (present) still in shock, looks at pindella again.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{survivors? only him? i... don't remember.}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{remember?}
<C>__{sharon}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{yes. i was there. i was there.}
<A>__{pindella stares, then...}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{his wife's mother survived, but... she was paralyzed.}
<A>__{she takes a moment, absorbing this.}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{elanora chu. she's still in town, i believe.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{does he... still see her?}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{he used to. i don't know.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm glad to see... he has someone else who cares about him. i know he's running from this. he left all his friends, his home, his whole life.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{he says... he doesn't remember the accident.}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{he lost a lot of memory. i tried to help him with that. he resisted. walked away.}
<A>__{she stares.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i think he remembers me.}
<A>__{very subdued now, she asks...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{how does he live?}
<C>__{pindella}
<D>__{he received a large settlement from the city, but he...barely touches it. he was a professional musician.}
<A>__{she stares at him and nods.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{trumpet.}
<A>__{as he says that, we hear our trumpet music begin a fast and furious muted trumpet, incredible riffs, and we use this to carry us, as we...}
