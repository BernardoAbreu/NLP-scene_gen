<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{something on your mind?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{tyler shrugs; turns on the radio, ignores jack.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this is as much mine as yours.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{is this a needlepoint club? is it about you and me?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}

<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to ricky and mechanic)}
<D>__{shut up!!}
<P>__{(to tyler)}
<D>__{i want to know what's going on.}
<A>__{tyler steers the car into the opposite lane, accelerates... opposing headlights get closer fast...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{this does not belong to us. we are not the leaders. we are not special.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{we are the all singing, all dancing crap of the world. we are all part of the same compost heap...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{tyler...}
<A>__{tyler steers back into the proper lane. the other car flies past, horn sounding...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what the hell ... ?!}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you choose your level of involvement. i won't make decisions for you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm not asking you to.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you're asking questions that don't have answers. you know just as much about project mayhem as anybody else.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't think that's true.}
<A>__{tyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up. through the windshield: oncoming headlights a truck.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{tyler... what is this... !}
<A>__{jack fights to turn the wheel, but tyler uses both hands.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{what will you wish you'd done before you died?}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{paint a self portrait.}
<C>__{mechanic}
<D>__{build a house.}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{and you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know! nothing!}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{if you died right now, how would you feel about your life?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i would feel nothing about my life? is that what you want to hear?!}
<A>__{the oncoming truck honks and flashes its lights. it moves to the other side of the road. tyler steers there, too.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{i want to hear the truth.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fuck my life. fuck fight club. fuck you and fuck marla. i'm sick of this. how's that?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{why do you think i blew up your condo?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat! it's not a seminar! you have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know about life, about friendship, about you and me.}
<A>__{nearing impact with the oncoming truck, tyler takes his hands off the wheel jack keeps his grip, turns the wheel... the car swerves... the truck roars past, spraying water, horn blasting. tyler looks at jack, his hands in the air. jack looks at tyler with dead eyes.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{okay, okay... fine...}
<A>__{jack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air. tyler studies jack face, impressed. tyler makes no move to take the wheel. through thr windshield: a stalled car ahead on the side of the road, surrounded by flares. jack and tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the shoulder... heading for the stalled car. their faces are illuminated by the light of the flares. tyler smiles. they smash into the stalled car airbags inflate! the back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass over tea kettle roll down a hill...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i'd never been in a car accident. this must've been what all those statistics felt like before i filed them into my reports.}
<A>__{the car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof.}
