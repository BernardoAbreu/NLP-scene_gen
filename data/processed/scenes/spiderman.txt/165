<L>__{exterior the dump night}
<A>__{ock's waldos are coiled around spider man's neck as the web slinger is dragged through the dump. his white eyes narrow and blink. there is a capped well behind a warning sign. ock tears off the cap and then hurls the groggy spidey down the well.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{goodbye, spider man!}
<L>__{interior the well night}
<A>__{spidey falls. he cannot grab onto the slimy walls. at the bottom of the foul pit is a bubbling blue luminescent pool. spidey claws frantically at the walls.}
<D>__{spider man noooooooooooooo!}
<A>__{he gets a hold and slides down to within a foot of the pool. its weird light shines up at him. he looks up at the starry sky.}
<D>__{spider man}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{okay now, spidey. easy does it.}
<A>__{he shoots a web about halfway up the pit. it hits the wall, sizzles, and drops back down.}
<D>__{spider man}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{don't give up, spidey. don't give up.}
<A>__{the web gizmo squirts out a pathetic patooey of web goo. then it hisses, empty!}
<D>__{spider man empty... now what do i do?}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{so you've avoided the nuclear pool, have you, spider man? spider man well, so far so good. but i can't hold on much longer.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{pity...! spider man oh, come on, ock, be a good sport. let's talk this over face to face... throw me a line...}
<A>__{spidey reaches out.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{okay... face to face... catch this!}
<A>__{ock, way up at the opening above, raises a huge drum above his head. the drum leaks toxic waste in orange tendrils. he is about to drop it down on spider man...}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{don't do it, professor!}
<A>__{we now see flash and liz in the blue mg.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(puts down the drum)}
<D>__{i know you... and you, young lady. both of you are in my physic class, aren't you...? come... you can help me. i need to get some of these drums to my laboratory... help me... and i will give you special grades. what'd you say?}
<A>__{suddenly he catches flash with a waldo and starts to choke him. liz screams and tries to help flash.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{leave him alone!!!}
<A>__{another waldo grabs her. roz now appears on the scene.}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{leave them alone otto!}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{but, they won't help me. everybody is trying to destroy my experiment. and so are you, rosomorf.}
<A>__{another waldo grabs roz by his arm.}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{otto... i was wrong. i've gone over your research. it's brilliant, otto. it's mad, but it's brilliant. you have much work left to do. i want to help you, otto. for the sake of science, go and do your experiment. leave... these kids alone and i will help you.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{you will? you too?}
<A>__{both flash and liz shake their heads okey dokey. ock gestures to flash and liz.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{help me with these drums, i need to get them to my laboratory immediately.}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{do as he says.}
<A>__{ock pushes flash and liz with his iron arm. gripping liz be her hair, he shoves her into the car.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{drive, flash, before i flush your girl right down the toilet! spider man professor rosomorf, it's no good, double dealing... why did you help him...?}
<A>__{rosomorf finds a rope and looks into the well.}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{don't lose your energy screaming. catch this rope and climb up, come on!}
