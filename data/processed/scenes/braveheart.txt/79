<L>__{exterior a field in scotland day}
<A>__{wallace has gathered the nobles, among them robert the bruce, mornay, and old craig, for a demonstration. hamish and stephen have placed a spearman's chestplate against a bale of hay. as william cranks the crossbow to its full cocked position and places a bolt in its slot, stephen tucks a melon behind the armor. william aims... and fires. the bolt slashes through the air and punches through the armor and the melon, leaving no doubt what it would do to a man's heart. the nobles pale.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{that is why the pope outlawed the weapon! it makes war too terrible.}
<C>__{mornay}
<D>__{how many does longshanks have?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{a thousand.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you have made me guardian of scotland. so i tell you this is what we face.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{we must sue for peace.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{peace?!}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{we cannot defeat this }
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{with cavalry not heavy, like the english, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ we could outmaneuver their bowmen!}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{it is suicide.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{sir william }
<A>__{the bruce sees wallace about to explode, and tries to intervene but wallace's anger is too great.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{we won at stirling and still you quibbled! we won at york and you would not support us! then i said nothing! now i say you are cowards!}
<A>__{the nobles grip their weapons; wallace, hamish and stephen are ready to finish this quarrel right here. robert the bruce, backed by mornay, steps between the two sides.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{please, sir william! speak with me alone! i beg you!}
<A>__{the nobles stalk away, and robert draws wallace away, to the target wallace shot, so they are alone.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{you have achieved more than anyone dreamed. but fighting these odds looks like rage, not courage. peace offers its rewards! has war become a habit you cannot break?}
<A>__{the question strikes deep.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{war finds me willing. i know it won't bring back all i have lost. but it can bring what none of us have ever had a country of our own. for that we need a king. we need you.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i am trying.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{then tell me what a king is! is he a man who believes only what others believe? is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? there is strength in you. i see it. i know it.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i must... consult with my father.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{and i will consult with mine.}
<A>__{robert the bruce walks off the field, heading the way the other nobles went. wallace rejoins hamish and stephen. they look to him; what do we do now?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{remember when the english turned their hounds on us? maybe we should introduce them to our dogs.}
