<LOC>__{INT. BARGE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.}
<LOC>__{INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north- west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way forward.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel smoke rising from its massive turbine vents. Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be considered pretty. She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward the tug at the other end.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY}
<ACTION>__{DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge (37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the north. They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern where the cable winds into a tow anchor.}

ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through the line of burners. Nothing moves. Epps moves quietly between the burners.

She shines her light up to see that she stands at the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that betrays a throughway to the outside.

She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with wide, unseeing eyes.

A dressing table sits against the far wall. A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the process of being unpacked. From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear. Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one of the books, opening it. Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols." A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it. She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool, KATIE.

As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS. After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody, wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears in the doorway. Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from behind at full speed, knocking him down.
