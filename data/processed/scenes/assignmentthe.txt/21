<L>__{exterior vienna international airport blizzard night}
<A>__{on the tarmac, an austrian airways dc9. tv cameras, lights, generators are set up in front of the plane, sending beams and pools of yellow light into the darkness and the snow which swirls all around as a pool of reporters stands ready to record whatever is about to go down. among a small group of officials is jack shaw. everyone's eyes are on an approaching yellow curtained bus.}
<B>__{on bus}
<A>__{as it gets closer, we can detect through its windshield a white raincoat and a black beret. carlos is standing by the driver with a machine pistol in one hand and a grenade in the other. close jack his eyes strain to get a better look at the terrorist, his arm down at his side.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{as the bus parks by the dc 9, carlos jumps out and waves to the media. not the customary v sign, but the wave of a celebrity... the hostages then, under their captors' guns, file compliantly out of the bus and onto the plane. a line of exhausted, bleary eyed middle aged men in expensive suits and in need of a shave. carlos however, is as fresh, alert and energetic as the morning of the attack. and he's definitely savoring the moment.}
<B>__{on jack}
<A>__{tense, he tries to be inconspicuous as he leans towards mickens.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i think it's him, but i can't be sure. not with those dark glasses and the beard...}
<B>__{on carlos}
<A>__{everyone on board, he too climbs the mobile steps and disappears into the plane. suddenly, he reemerges and comes down to where the officials and jack stand. as jack watches him intently, he faces the minister of the interior. in the window of the plane we see koj holding a grenade to the pilot's head.}
<B>__{angle on carlos}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{minister of the interior, i presume...?}
<A>__{the distinguished looking man, who looks a bit like kurt waldheim, nods.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{i'm sorry this had to happen in austria. we have no quarrel with your government.}
<A>__{his eye catching jack, he stops in mid sentence. a devilish smile crosses his lips as he turns towards him. he pulls a cigarette out and crosses right over to jack, up close and as they say, very personal. the snowflakes whirl surrealistically around them as the two stand face to face.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{pardon monsieur...}
<A>__{he mimes flicking a match. he takes off his glasses and looks at jack and smiles.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{we were never really properly introduced mister shaw. my name is carlos.}
<A>__{with a cunning, mocking smile he extends his hand out to shake jack's. jack stares at him, ever so slowly beginning to raise his hand. with that move he knows the gun will come slapping into his palm and he will be able to take carlos out no matter what the cost.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{eat shit and die slow.}
<A>__{his hand starts rising. in another second the gun will spring into it. just then we hear:}
<C>__{mickena }
<D>__{jack, no!}
<A>__{jack turns to look at mickens. mickens indicates the photographers.}
<C>__{mickena}
<D>__{you don't want your picture taken shaking his hand.}
<A>__{jack is momentarily confused. he has turned to mickens thinking perhaps he was calling out a warning and now the moment for the shot has passed. he turns back to carlos who shrugs and steps over to the austrian minister so that the minister now is between jack and carlos and the shot is lost.}
<C>__{carlos}
<P>__{(to the minister)}
<D>__{as i was saying, i'm sorry about the loss of life. and thank you for your cooperation.}
<A>__{once again he sticks out his hand. only this time, as the cameras roll, austria's minister of the interior shakes the hand of the archterrorist in what will go down in history as the "handshake of shame."}
<B>__{on jack}
<A>__{his eyes tell it all.}
