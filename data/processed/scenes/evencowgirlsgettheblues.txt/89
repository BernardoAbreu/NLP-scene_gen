<A>__{the ranch is now surrounded by two hundred federal marshalls reinforced by a dozen fbi agents with loaded guns taking position outside the ranch. sissy gets out of her car and walks past the posse and through the gates. kym carries a radio which is playing "the day old apple strudel polka" across the corral. she carries the radio as if it is a suitcase full of skunk lice.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{man, this is the stupidest music i've ever heard. this radio should have stayed in the privy where it belongs.}
<A>__{kym ropes the radio to her saddle horn and prepares to give it a ride across the dakota hills. she gets on her horse and rides by the ranch bungalows and spies sissy sitting in the outhouse.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{howdy.}
<A>__{kym gets off her horse and hugs sissy.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{you know what you're getting into if you come over to the lake...}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{yes, but i want to be there. i want to see jellybean. i want to see the cranes.}
<A>__{they ride across the hills. then they stop at an outlook and sissy sees the circular barricade in the field below.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{we heard on the radio that the judge has set delores's bail at fifty thousand dollars. now she won't be here when we really need her.}
