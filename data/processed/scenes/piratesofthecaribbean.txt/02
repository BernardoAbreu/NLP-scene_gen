<L>__{exterior h.m.s. dauntless forecastle day}
<A>__{elizabeth swann, strawberry blond hair, stands at the bow railing, gazing at the seas, still singing }
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{...drink up me hearties, yo, ho...}
<A>__{joshamee gibbs, who was born old, skin a dark leather, clutches her shoulder, startling her.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{quiet, missy! cursed pirates sail these waters. you want to call 'em down on us?}
<A>__{elizabeth stares wide eyed at him.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{mr. gibbs.}
<A>__{norrington, a dashing young man, royal navy to the core, glares sternly at gibbs. standing besides him is governor weatherby swan, a man of obvious high station, brass buttons on his thick blue jacket. he is elizabeth's father.}
<C>__{norrington }
<D>__{that will do.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{she was singing about pirates. bad luck to sing about pirates, with us mired in this unnatural fog mark my words.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{consider them marked. on your way.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{'aye, captain.}
<P>__{(as he moves off)}
<D>__{bad luck to have a woman on board, too. even a mini'ture one.}
<A>__{he returns to his deck swabbing duties, surreptitiously takes a quick swig from flask.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{think again, miss swan. vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. i intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirates brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.}
<A>__{elizabeth doesn't know what 'a short drop and a sudden stop' means. gibbs helpfully mimes: a man being hung.}
<C>__{swan}
<D>__{captain norrington... i appreciate your fervor, but i am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{my apologies, governor.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{actually, i find it all fascinating.}
<C>__{swan}
<D>__{and that's what concerns me. elizabeth, dear... we will be landing in port royal very soon, and beginning our new lives. wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{yes, father.}
<A>__{chastised, she turns away, to look out over the bow rail.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{i still think it would be exciting to meet a pirate...}
<A>__{the fog still hems in the ship; very little of the sea is visible but suddenly, a figure comes into view. a young boy, will turner, floating on his back in the otherwise empty water. there is nothing to show where he came from, or how he came to be there.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{look! a boy! in the water!}
<A>__{norrington and swann spot him }
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{man overboard!}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{boy overboard!}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{fetch a hook! haul him out of there!}
<A>__{quick movement and activity on the deck. sailors use a boathook to snag the boy he the passes. norrington and swann haul him aboard, and lay him on the deck. elizabeth sidles in for a closer look.}
<C>__{norrington }
<D>__{he's still breathing.}
<C>__{swan}
<D>__{where did he come from?}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{mary mother of god ...}
<A>__{attention is turned away from the boy the sea is no longer empty. wreckage from a ship litters the water... along with the bodies of its crew. what is left of the ship's hull burns, a ragged british flag hanging limply from the stern. the h.m.s. dauntless slips silently through it all. the scene calls for hushed voices.}
<C>__{swan}
<D>__{what happened here?}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{an explosion in the powder magazine. merchant vessels run heavily armed.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{lot of good it did them...}
<P>__{(off swan's look)}
<D>__{everyone's thinking it! i'm just saying it! pirates!}
<C>__{swan}
<D>__{there is no proof of that. it could have been an accident. captain, these men were protection. if there is even the slightest chance one of those poor devils is still alive, we cannot abandon them!}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{of course not, governor.}
<P>__{(to the crew)}
<D>__{come about and strike the sails! unlash the boats! gunnery crew... jackets off the cannons!}
<P>__{(to swann)}
<D>__{hope for the best...prepare for the worst.}
<P>__{(to two sailors)}
<D>__{move the boy aft. we'll need the deck clear.}
<A>__{they lift the boy. swann pulls elizabeth away from the rail, away from the hideous scene in the water.}
<C>__{swan}
<D>__{elizabeth, i want you to accompany the boy. he's in your charge now. you'll watch over him?}
<A>__{elizabeth nods gravely. swann hurries away to help unstow the longboat. the sailors lay the boy gently on the poop deck, behind the wheel, then hurry off. elizabeth kneels down besides the boy. his good looks are not lost on her. she reaches out, gently brushes the blond hair from his eyes suddenly, he grabs her wrist, awake now. elizabeth is startled, but their eyes lock. she takes his hand in hers.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{my name is elizabeth swann.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{will turner.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i'm watching over you, will.}
<A>__{he clutches her hands, then slips back into unconsciousness. his movement has opened the collar of his shirt; elizabeth sees he wears a chain around his neck. she tugs it free, revealing a gold medallion. one side is blank. she turns it over a skull gazes up at her. vaguely aztec in design, but to her eyes, it means one thing only:}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{you're a pirate.}
<A>__{she glances back at the crew. sees norrington, giving orders, moving toward her. she looks back at will comes to a quick decision. takes the medallion from around his neck. hides it under her coat. norrington arrives.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{did he speak?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{his name is will turner that's all i found out.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{very good.}
<A>__{norrington hurries off. elizabeth steals away to the stern of the ship. examines her prize the gold medallion. a wisp of wind, and she looks up out over the sea, moving through the fog, silent as a ghost, is a large sailing ship, a schooner it has black sails. elizabeth stares, too frightened to move, or cry out. the ship is obscured by the fog it as it passes but not the mizzen top ... and there hangs the frightening skull and crossbones of the jolly roger. elizabeth looks from it to the medallion the skull on the flag is the same as the one on the medallion. fog surrounds and closes in on the black ship except for the black flag. as elizabeth watches, the skull appears to turn and grin at her elizabeth shuts her eyes tight }
