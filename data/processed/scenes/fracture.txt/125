<A>__{lobruto is walking toward his car when willy steps out of the garage and calls after him:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{his wife is dead!}
<A>__{lobruto turns. uncertain what willy is getting at.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{we can still get him. we can take him back to court.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{willy...}
<A>__{willy comes toward him excited, insistent:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{double jeopardy doesn't apply! we bring a new charge of homicide.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{willy what happened to you, on the helicopter we don't even know if we could prove }
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{no: he shot her and she died. the fact that it took time the fact that he went to trial in between, just for shooting her doesn't matter. he fired a gun and caused her death, and that's murder.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if he can twist the law around then so can we.}
<A>__{lobruto thinks it out. wary.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{a second indictment on the same incident?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{a man burns down a house; we charge him with arson. there were people sleeping upstairs and after weeks in the hospital, they die. we'd charge him with murder. right?}
<A>__{lobruto nods. on the fence, but seeing it now. impressed with the young man's fervor, and his logic. but he shakes his head.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{all your evidence is still toxic. the confession, the arrest it's all still inadmissible.}
<A>__{willy grimaces. looks down. thinking, intense.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{i'm sorry, willy. it was a good idea, but }
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i will get something new.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{willy looks up at him. calm now.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you don't want to know.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{willy, you can't }
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i don't work for you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{right?}
<A>__{beat. lobruto sighs, as willy nods and turns to start back to the garage. with work to do.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{don't do anything crazy.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{what else have we got left?}
<A>__{willy disappears inside.}
