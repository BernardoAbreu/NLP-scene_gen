<L>__{interior mumford's office day}
<A>__{follett sits up abruptly on the couch and twists toward mumford, agitated.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{stop now.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{why? i'm paying for this.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{not for this. not me, you're not.}
<C>__{follett}
<P>__{(challenging)}
<D>__{you find it distasteful, don't you?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{it doesn't matter how i feel about it. it's how you feel about it that matters.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{i enjoy it. does that make me some kind of pervert? just because a man has a rich imaginative life }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you came because it's taking over. you're in its grip.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{i never said that.}
<A>__{mumford's tone suddenly picks up a touch of steel.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{where's your wife, henry?}
<A>__{follett flinches, settles back down onto the couch, sulking.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{where's your wife, henry?}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{go to hell.}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(softer)}
<D>__{i didn't hear you.}
<A>__{follett mutters something to himself, then is silent until }
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{we got divorced.}
<P>__{(petulant)}
<D>__{i had to get rid of her. she couldn't satisfy me.}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(shouts, follett jumps)}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{follett seems to shrink in size. they've been here before and he doesn't like it.}
<C>__{follett}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i was... never satisfied.}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(normal again)}
<D>__{now we're back on track.}
<A>__{again, follett says something under his breath.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{follett}
<P>__{(long beat)}
<D>__{you are so mean.}
