<A>__{jackie shakes her head "no."}
<C>__{ordell }
<D>__{well, that's mighty honorable of you.}

<B>__{max in car}
<A>__{max drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his face. he can't stop thinking about jackie. during the night she'd have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying; "we could have fun". unless she was appraising kinda him with the look, making a judgment and what it said was; "i could use you". either way it was a turn on. max pulls into the driveway of his small house in torrance.}
<B>__{ordell and jackie}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{yeah, somebody musta been real mad at beaumont. or they were afraid of what he might say to keep from doin some time. i'magine from time to time they asked you a whole shitload of questions. and you didn't give 'em no answer?}
<A>__{jackie shakes her head from side to side. ordell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle of her throat.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{you scared of me?}
<A>__{jackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes leaving his. reaches over the seat}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{you got a reason to be nervous with me?}
<A>__{with his hands on jackie's throat, staring into the woman's eyes, from below frame then feels something hard the fuck against his crotch. neither break eye contact. ordell hears a click. can't believe it.}

<D>__{i understand woman, damn!}
<C>__{jackie}

<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{let's get realistic, baby. sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. that's why you came here to kill me.}
<C>__{ordell}

<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ it's okay. i forgive you. now, let's say if i tell on you, i walk. and if i don't, i go to jail.}
