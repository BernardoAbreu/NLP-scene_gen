<A>__{the black clad figure from behind again strides past coworkers who look away.}
<D>__{secretary intercom ms. salander's here.}
<A>__{armansky breathes a defeated sigh, taps the intercom button twice to say `okay, let her in.' lisbeth salander walks in: a small, pale, anorexic looking waif in her early 20's. short black dyed hair pierced eyelid tattoo of a wasp on her neck; probably several more under her black leather jacket black t shirt, black jeans, black caterpillar boots. frode is only middlingly successful in concealing his initial reaction to her. this isn't punk fashion. this is someone saying, stay the fuck away from me.}
<C>__{armansky}
<D>__{lisbeth, mr. dirch frode.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{how do you do?}
<A>__{she doesn't shake frode's hand, but does address him:}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{something wrong with the report?}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{no. it seems quite thorough. there's a wealth of data here. but i'm also interested to know what's not in it.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{there's nothing not in it.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{your opinion of him isn't.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{i'm not paid to give my opinion.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{so you don't have one?}
<A>__{salander sends armansky a weary look. his look back begs her not to say anything unpleasant. eventually }
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{he's clean. in my opinion.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{he's excuse me?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{he's honest. he's who he presents himself to be. in his business, that's an asset.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{there's less in his asset column after his conviction today.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{that's true. he made a fool of himself with that. if it happened that way.}
<A>__{frode looks at armansky. what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{if he made up the story, that's out of character. so is giving up without a fight. people don't do things that are out of character.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{are you saying he was set up?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{that wasn't part of my assignment.}
<A>__{and, apparently, she has no opinion on it either.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{you're quite right he made a fool of himself professionally. how big of a fool did he make of himself financially?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{the judgement will just about empty his savings.}
<A>__{this seems to please frode more than anything else that has been said, and salander sees it.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{may i go?}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{your report is light in another area. his personal life. anything you chose not to include?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{nothing that warranted inclusion.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{i'm not sure if that means yes or no.}
<C>__{armansky}
<D>__{i think what ms. salander means, and i agree, is that everyone has a right to a certain amount of privacy, even when they're being investigated.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{not in this case. i have to know if there's anything about him i might find unsavory even if she doesn't.}
<A>__{armansky's look to her at once apologizes for frode, and encourages her to speak. she finally relents but puts no more spin on it than any other piece of raw data }
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{he's had a long sexual relationship with his co editor. it wrecked his marriage, but not hers. her husband accepts it. sometimes she sleeps at blomkvist's, sometimes at home.}
<A>__{frode thinks about that, perhaps imagining how much simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{you were right not to include that.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{anything else?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{please think before you say no.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{i don't want to be surprised by something later.}
<A>__{salander offers nothing more.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{so. nothing else. in the personal department. you're sure.}
<C>__{salander}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{he likes sandwiches.}
