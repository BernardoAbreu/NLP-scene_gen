<L>__{interior department store day}
<A>__{brandi, the make up counter girl, globs on tons of make up. she's a hot girl who looks like she's spent a few sticky nights in the bed of a truck. ronnie stands back and watches brandi. finally, he walks up to her.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{hey, brandi.}
<A>__{brandi looks up from her mirror and then goes back to applying make up.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that color looks great on your skin. not just that color, but i've noticed that all make up looks really good on you. especially the blue around your eyes. i bet it drives the men crazy.}
<A>__{brandi glares at ronnie.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{it's okay. i can say that because i'm taken.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{what do you want, ronnie?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm here on official business. see, i don't know if you know this, but i have recently been made head of mall security. did you hear about that?}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well, i'm sure you will. it's actually pretty huge news. but the reason i stopped by is to tell you that it looks like we've got a pervert on the loose. a real live psychopath who gains sexual gratification by exposing himself to ladies such as yourself. i just want to warn you to be careful when coming and going to work.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{okay, got it.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{and you may not want to wear any of those skirts that you like to wear.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{what skirts?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you know what skirts. something like that could set him off. and for that matter, you better not wear any of those little low cut top things either, okay? especially with those black bras because, you can really see them in the light. perverts really tend to notice stuff like that. okay, see you later.}
<A>__{ronnie takes off and leaves brandi still applying make up.}
