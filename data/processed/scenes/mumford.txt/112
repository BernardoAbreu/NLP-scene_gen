<L>__{interior dr. delbanco's office day}
<A>__{lionel is here with delbanco and sheeler. this time, delbanco is behind his desk, sheeler across the room on the sofa.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{don't you find it incredibly convenient that everyone who could possibly corroborate his story has recently died some exotic death?}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{they're neither all recent nor exotic.}
<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{but they're certainly dead. and yes, personally, i find it a bit odd.}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{it could happen. what about his state certification exams? the records seem to be in order.}
<A>__{lionel's derisive snort is so obnoxious, it's hard to bear.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{what's easier than hacking your way into a state computer and inserting some numbers? for all you know he never even took the exams!}
<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{that's true.}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{i don't know that it's all that easy...}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{doctor, correct me if i'm wrong, but it sounds to me like you've gone for this guy's story hook, line and bull twaddle.}
<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{you do seem much more disposed toward him than i understand, ernest. did i miss something?}
<C>__{delbanco}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{oh, for god's sake, phyllis we have no reason to doubt the man! are we listening to lionel now?}
<A>__{sheeler jumps, so shocked is she by his outburst, and so humiliated for lionel to witness it. fighting tears and trying to maintain her dignity, she gathers up her things and walks to the door. delbanco, immediately contrite, stands up.}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{phyllis, i'm sorry. i didn't mean to shout...}
<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{no, dr. delbanco, it is i who am sorry. sorry to have wasted your time with such...}
<A>__{she breaks into tears and rushes out of the office. delbanco is left facing lionel, who gives him exactly the look the doctor least wants to see.}
