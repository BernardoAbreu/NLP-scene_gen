<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{well now it has this sorta phlegm rattle behind it...}
<A>__{stopped at the lobby. a family of four gets in. oblivious, kimmy demonstrates the phlegm rattle. really gets into it. as the family watches, julianne tries her own version. like that? no. more like this. the family is looking at each other.}

<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{he's not a balance sheet, so many wonderful qualities, so many faults. he's michael.}
<A>__{from her heart.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{and loving him means loving all of this.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{do you get nervous in small confined spaces?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{so it's sweet of you to be protective...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{let me rephrase that...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{but nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...}

<D>__{i'm not joking. i had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, i've got 'em.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{and the answer was so simple.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i was gonna predict that.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{you win.}
<A>__{julianne blinks. excuse me?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{you're enshrined in his heart and memory. unassailable. which works out great.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i've missed a step.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{he has you on a pedestal. and me in his arms.}
<A>__{oh. julianne smiles. lunges for the emergency button, yanking it so hard it comes off in her hand. a terrifying buzzer ensures.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{jesus, we're trapped!}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{ju...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{no, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!}

<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{there's a panel up there, you could boost me...}
<A>__{ripping off her platform shoes.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{you know how little air is in these things? i've seen statistics! once you're trapped between floors...}
<A>__{kimmy taps her. points to the lighted panel. it says ph, they've reached the penthouse.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{god! then the door is jammed!}
<A>__{takes a heavy platform and begins banging the metal door with all her strength, sending resounding booms throughout the area, as kimmy reaches and... ... presses door open. the metal doors part, opening directly onto the banquet room, just as a mighty blow comes down, and the platform flies from julianne's hand straight between... ... two identical stunning young women, serving as twin hostesses for the shower. a beat of mutually stupefied looks, and we hear the shoe crash somewhere, to a small spattering of shrieks.}
<C>__{mandy}
<D>__{mah gawd, it's the bride, and the woman she'll nevah live up to!}
<C>__{kimmy }
<D>__{that would be us.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{did she say th' wrong thang agin? it is so in character!}
<A>__{amanda and samantha newhouse, 19 year old twins. true southern belles, with the faces of angels and bodies made for hot oil wrestling. mandy's hair is dyed ash blonde, sammy's is amber. otherwise, the experience is similar.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(thrusts out her hand)}
<D>__{i'm julianne potter, and...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{... we'd be the vengeful sluts. we came in complementary colors.}
<C>__{mandy}
<D>__{have you sized up the groomsmen, jules? as m. of h., you get first fuck. don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{... unless he has a hump.}
<A>__{the girls cast identical blank looks at kimberly.}
<C>__{kimmy }
<D>__{dry. i told you.}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{is this michael's julianne?}
<A>__{all eyes turn to an elegant woman of barely 40. she has her daughter's hair and eyes and slender form. but the bearing rules half an empire. fonda would envy.}
<C>__{isabelle}
<D>__{i'm isabelle wallace, and my handsome new son scarcely did you justice, girl.}
<A>__{she takes both of julianne's hands, and our heroine is sort of magically charmed. as if touched by glinda the good witch of the north.}
<C>__{isabelle}
<D>__{now, my husband says to scoot you over to the ballpark, so you can hang with michael. but first, you have to meet a lot of really old women.}
<A>__{looking warmly in her eyes...}
<C>__{isabelle}
<D>__{that is, if you've absorbed enough profanity.}
<A>__{flicks a glance at the twins. leads julianne off...}
<P>__{mandy (o.s., pouting)}
<D>__{we sayed one fuck.}
