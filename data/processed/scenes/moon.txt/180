<A>__{sam 1 begins to walk left, down towards the rec room and the monitoring station, but hesitates he turns the other way, towards the infirmary, heads that way instead.}
<L>__{interior infirmary continuous}
<A>__{lying in one of the infirmary beds, eyes closed, a network of wires attached to his chest...sam. we don't know which sam it is yet. he is clean shaven. he looks like any one of the clones down in the secret chamber; then again he could just as easily be sam 2. and that's what sam 1 naturally assumes as he enters the infirmary and sees him lying there. sam 1 moves closer, curious, until he is standing right at the edge of the bed. sam 1 reaches out his hand to wake him up when there is a voice from the doorway behind:}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{don't touch him.}
<A>__{our suspicions are now confirmed. the sam in the infirmary bed is a new clone. we will call him sam 3.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{he's not conscious yet. gerty and i only woke him up a few hours ago.}
<A>__{sam 1 is not even remotely on the same page.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{sam 2 puts his finger to his lips. then:}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{come to the rec room.}
<A>__{sam 2 turns and leaves. sam 1 follows slowly, one or two glances at the sleeping clone along the way.}
