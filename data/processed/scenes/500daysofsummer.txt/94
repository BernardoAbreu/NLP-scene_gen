<D>__{"five. travel. take some time to see another environment. get perspective. it's a beautiful world. it will be for you again someday."}

<B>__{freeze on tom.}
<A>__{information bubbles pop up on the screen to point out that tom is standing in poison oak. there's a rusty bear trap a step ahead of him. a giant poisonous snake creeping up behind him. a tick on his leg. and in the distance a hunter has tom sized up in his rifle sight.}
