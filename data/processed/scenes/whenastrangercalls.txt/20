<A>__{jill is sitting on the sofa, a drink in one hand, a cigarette in the other. she is waiting. she sets her glass down, stubs out the cigarette, leans back and sighs. she is very tense. then the phone rings. she rises from the sofa and slowly crosses to the table. she sits down and picks up the phone. during this conversation it becomes apparent that the voice has a slight english accent.}
