<L>__{interior burton living room evening}
<A>__{the burtons are having coffee. barbara has been glancing through a new murder mystery with a lurid cover. as guy enters, anne rises to greet him.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{hello, darling. have you had your dinner?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{on the train.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you weren't in metcalf all this time? we expected you hours ago.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{i didn't. they sometimes throw a suspect in the can and keep him there all night.}
<C>__{senator}
<P>__{(after a disapproving glance at barbara)}
<D>__{sit down, guy. sit down. give him some coffee, anne.}
<C>__{senator }
<P>__{(back to guy)}
<D>__{you had no trouble with the police of course, once they verified your alibi?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(morosely)}
<D>__{when an alibi is full of bourbon, sir, it can't stand up.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you mean the professor was boiled?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{completely. he didn't remember me.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but, you knew he was on the train! wasn't that enough to prove you were on it, too?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{apparently not at the right time. they suggested i could have caught the train at baltimore after miriam was murdered. they had it all worked out }
<P>__{(taps his head)}
<D>__{in their timetables.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(growing indignant}
<D>__{and increasingly}
<P>__{nervous)}
<D>__{that's ridiculous. they're acting as if you were guilty.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(somewhat subdued and}
<D>__{trying to be}
<P>__{comforting)}
<D>__{everything will be all right, anne. the police were just being thorough }
<P>__{(she's unsure of}
<D>__{herself, and defers}
<P>__{to the senator)}
<D>__{weren't they, daddy?}
<C>__{senator}
<D>__{i certainly hope so.}
<P>__{(to guy)}
<D>__{what is your next step?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(wryly)}
<D>__{whatever it is, the police will know it. they gave me a present come take a look.}
<A>__{he crosses to the window, lifts the curtain slightly, then turns back to the others.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{my guardian angel.}
<A>__{the group move to look out the window, the senator with reluctance.}
<B>__{long shot exterior street from their viewpoint}
<A>__{through the window we see the figure of a man across the street. he is lighting a cigarette and strolling up and down.}
<B>__{back to group}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{you're being tailed!}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(turning to them)}
<D>__{that's leslie hennessy. he works sixteen hours a day. somebody else takes over for the next eight.}
<P>__{(drops the curtain, turns back into room)}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, hennessy's a very nice fellow.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{shouldn't we ask him in for coffee or something?}
<A>__{nobody bothers to answer her. the senator is disturbed, but confident of his own prestige as he goes back to his coffee.}
<C>__{senator}
<D>__{i will have him called off immediately of course.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{i'm afraid where i go, hennessy goes. even to the senate.}
<C>__{senator}
<P>__{(pausing with his cup hallway to his mouth)}
<D>__{is he likely to picket my office?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{very likely.}
<A>__{the senator's cup is suddenly back on its saucer and he is on his feet, pacing nervously.}
<C>__{senator}
<D>__{i would suggest, guy, for your own peace of mind, of course, that you work here at the house for a few days.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{it would be less embarrassing for you.}
<A>__{guy has been looking at anne and is concerned at the worry on her face. he nods in assent to the senator's suggestion, but puts his hand over anne's.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(hopelessly)}
<D>__{then what about practicing? perhaps i'd better forget forest hills?}
<C>__{senator}
<D>__{my dear boy, wouldn't it look rather awkward if you suddenly canceled all your plans.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{he's right, guy. you mustn't do anything that would look suspicious. you've got to carry on as though nothing has happened.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(pointing out the window)}
<D>__{escorted by mr. hennessy.}
<A>__{the are crestfallen again. randall, the manservant, has entered with the telephone.}
<C>__{randall}
<D>__{a call for you, mr. haines. they say it is urgent.}
<A>__{the phone is plugged in to a connection and guy crosses the room and picks up the receiver. the burtons watch him.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{hello }
