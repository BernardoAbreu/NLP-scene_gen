<A>__{kenny's body is floating through a great void. a peaceful song plays as he soars upwards to the heavens. note except for kenny's little construction paper body, this entire sequence should be done in 3d cgi. ahead of him, kenny can see a great white light. it appears warm and inviting. now kenny notices large beautiful breasts bobbing up and down in the heavens. he reaches out to touch them. kenny blissfully floats upward toward the bright light and bobbing breasts. the music crescendos as kenny gets almost close enough to the light to touch it. just then, a huge, electronic sign pops up. 'access denied'. suddenly, kenny goes spiraling downward. the song changes to a ministry type number as kenny's surroundings start to become darker and more twisted. kenny's hapless spirit enters a horrifying red tunnel, filled with flames and heat.}

<A>__{burning souls scream and cry all around kenny, as his body plunges into what is now obviously the depths of hell. kenny passes images of hitler, john wayne gacy, hunger and disease as he continues through the twisting tunnel. he then passes images of jimmy stewart and gandhi. all of whom are opportunely locked in hell for all eternity.}
