<L>__{interior grocery store. day.}
<A>__{there is an old clerk behind the counter, and standing in the b.g., almost out of our vision, is a butcher an enormous giant of a man. clyde steps up to the counter.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{give me a loaf of bread, a dozen eggs and a quart of milk.}
<A>__{the clerk gets the order and puts it in a bag. he rings open the cash register preparatory to asking clyde for the money. clyde pulls his gun.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{this is a stickup. i will take all the money in that drawer now.}
<A>__{he reaches over the counter into the cash drawer and grabs the bills. he smiles. suddenly looming beside clyde is the butcher, brandishing a meat cleaver. camera looks up at this formidable sight as the cleaver comes crashing down, missing clyde and sticking in the wooden counter. he grabs clyde around the chest in a bear hug and actually lifts him off the ground. the struggle is in silence. clyde is terrified, fighting wildly to get free. the gun in clyde's hand is pinned, because the man has clyde's arm pinned to his thigh. clyde tries to raise the barrel at an upward angle to shoot, finally he is able to do so. he fires. the bullet enters the butcher's stomach. the butcher screams, but reacts like a wounded animal, more furious than ever. he still holds clyde in a fierce hug, staggering around the store, knocking into shelves and spilling cans. clyde is hysterical with fear. he shoots the butcher again. the butcher falls to his knees, but still he doesn't release clyde. in a panic, clyde drags the man to the door, trying to get out.}
