<L>__{interior hospital corridor (the bride's floor) night}
<A>__{we see a hospital orderly's bright red and white reeboks softly slapping against the smooth surface of the institution's floor. they make a sound nothing like bill's shoes.}
<B>__{screen goes to split screen left side}
<A>__{the bride listening to them getting closer. we hear the step...step...step...in time with orderly's sneakers.}

<C>__{orderly}
<P>__{(in time)}
<D>__{she's right in here.}
<B>__{split screen finishes}
<A>__{stay with the bride's screen the bride decides the best course of action, till she gets her bearings, is to play possum. she throws herself back down on the bed, just as the three men enter her room. they see just what they expected to see, the bride lying in her bed in her coma. she duplicates her comatose eyes wide open fixed stare. except knowing she's awake, and sees everything in front of her, creates a slightly different effect. the bride, however, while she sees the two truckdrivers for what they are, when she sees the orderly she sees bill, when the orderly talks she hears bill. we however will never see bill's face completely. the orderly takes her shee covering off, and hitches up her hospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed. he does kind of a "ta da" presentation of her vagina.}
<C>__{the orderly}

<C>__{warren}
<D>__{i seen better.}
<A>__{cu the bride eyes wide open playing possum. she can't believe she's being exhibited in this manner. a look of chagrin crosses her trying to be expressionless face, "i've seen a fuck load better than you, fatass."}
<C>__{the orderly}
<D>__{yeah, in a movie maybe. but i know damn well this is the best pussy you ever saw you had touchin rights to. the price is seventy five dollars a fuck gentlemen, you gittin your freak on or what?}
<A>__{the truckers pay the bill of fare. as the orderly counts the truckers' money, he lays out the rules;}
<C>__{the orderly}
<D>__{here's the rules; rule number one; no punchin 'er. nurse comes in tomorrow an she got 'er a shiner or less some teeth, jig's up. so no knuckle sandwiches under no circumstances. and by the way, this little cunt's a spitter it's a motor reflex thing but spit or no, no punchin. now are we absolutely positively clear about rule number one?}

<A>__{the orderly turns to leave, then remembers something, and turns back. he takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline in the history of cinema, and hands it to warren.}
<C>__{the orderly}
