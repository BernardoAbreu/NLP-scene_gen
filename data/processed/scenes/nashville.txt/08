<L>__{interior coffee shop day}
<A>__{at the entrance is another "connie white" display and from the jukebox we hear one of her songs. the waitress, sueleen, drops a fork, then gets another from an overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, tricycle man. there are several people at the counter with him, including green, who has just walked in. another man enters, delbert reese. sueleen waits on all of them. a small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full or dishes. this is wade.}
<C>__{wade}
<P>__{(to sueleen)}
<D>__{you want a ride into town?}
<C>__{sueleen}
<D>__{you bet.}
<A>__{reese looks up, checking out sueleen, then wade, then the tricycle man, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and checkbook are still there, then he buries himself in his newspaper.}
<C>__{sueleen}
<D>__{got me an audition tonight.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... ten minutes, okay?}
<A>__{she nods and talks to the tricycle man. reese keeps sneaking looks at her.}
<C>__{sueleen}
<D>__{i've just been waiting for the right spot to sing in... i'm so nervous...}
<A>__{she laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.}
<C>__{sueleen}
<D>__{i'm good, though. there ain't but one sueleen gay i don't mean to be conceited, but really it's true. i've been taking special coaching lessons from zeke willard he's just wonderful. teaches you how to phrase; that's really important. and breathing. well, you know all about that. anyway, i wrote this song.}
<A>__{she looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some glasses. the jukebox continues to play connie white, and every time someone walks by, sueleen stops. she finally gets through the song and discovers reese has been watching, too. she looks away from him to the tricycle man, who smiles. be has finished his meal.}
<C>__{sueleen}
<D>__{oh, listen, i really do go on. here's your check. sure has been nice talking to you.}
<A>__{as she removes her apron, a haven hamilton song comes on the jukebox, "keep on a goin'." the tricycle man leaves.}
