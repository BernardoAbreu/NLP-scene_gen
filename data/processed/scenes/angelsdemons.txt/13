<A>__{ vittoria steps through an airlock and emerges in a gleaming white underground lab. everything, everywhere, is white. there are a dozen columns of polished steel about three feet tall, each of which supports a transparent canister the size of a tennis ball can. they appear empty. leonardo bentivoglio, sixtyish, black pants and a short sleeve black shirt, is at work at a command console in the center of the room. (they speak to each other in italian, subtitled.)}

<C>__{leonardo }
<D>__{we're in god's hands now.}
<A>__{while leonardo and vittoria work at the console, we move slowly across the room toward those strange vertical pillars.}
