<D>__{eddie...? what's your read.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{it flew. of course, he's not going to tell you right now...}
<A>__{van loon notices atwood is using a cane.}
<C>__{van loon}
<D>__{jesus. he seems frail.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{might be an act.}
<C>__{van loon}
<D>__{yeah, doesn't track. he's not even}
<A>__{atwood's gone. van loon looks at eddie.}
<C>__{van loon }

<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{when this is over?}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i don't know. you haven't given me the answer.}
<A>__{van loon eyes him. eddie is only half kidding.}
<C>__{van loon}
<D>__{you haven't asked the question.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{all right. if all this comes off... what's my take?}
<C>__{van loon}
<D>__{you should have pre negotiated.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i trust you.}
<C>__{van loon}
<D>__{you shouldn't.}
<A>__{eddie returns van loon's look coolly, implying that it really might be in van loon's best interest to trust him.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{well, given the scale of my contribution, it can't be anything lese than forty. let's say forty five.}
<C>__{van look}
<D>__{done. forty five thousand dollars.}
<A>__{both he and eddie start to laugh.}
<C>__{van loon}
<D>__{forty million's plenty, eddie. there's plenty more where this came from.}
<A>__{he tries to read eddie's smile which is removed, far away...}
<C>__{van look}
<D>__{...but you're not going to continue working for me, are you?}
<A>__{eddie opens his mouth. pauses.}
<C>__{van loon}
<D>__{don't lie. you're already bored. onto the nexterior..?}
<A>__{van loon didn't get to where he is for nothing.}
<C>__{van loon }
<D>__{i would really love to know what, after a forty million dollar payout, is "next" to you. but you're not going to tell me that, either.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{and i'm not sure i want to know. might singe my ego.}
<A>__{he shakes eddie's hand.}
<C>__{van loon }
<D>__{i will open a line of credit for you. even a tough nut like you's going to want a few toys.}
