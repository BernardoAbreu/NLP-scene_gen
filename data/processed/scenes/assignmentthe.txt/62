<L>__{interior corridor off observation room day}
<A>__{jack walks ramirez down the corridor. they pass the surveillance room, the small cell with its satellite dish and single computer terminal and operator established earlier as technician #1. from here, cables snake their way along everywhere. the place has the look of a mobile high tech spy station that just happens to be set up in a former prison. ramirez looks around. the idea of being in a prison is obviously uncomfortable for him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{your mother is irish... irish american.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{something wrong, miguel?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{...no... not really.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{your father was in a cuban prison if i'm correct.}
<A>__{ramirez turns and looks at him in surprise.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{your mother used to take you to visit him there, didn't she?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm sure that's a disturbing memory.}
<A>__{he looks ramirez straight in the eyes.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{you didn't set this up in a prison because it was the first piece of real estate you were shown, did you, sir?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{let's just say everything has its purpose. and miguel... no one is to know anything about you other than that you're our student. so don't call me sir, because it's like wearing a sign on your forehead that you're military. from here on out forget the navy.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{yes sir... gotcha...}
