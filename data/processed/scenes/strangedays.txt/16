<L>__{exterior alley and street night}
<A>__{iris sprints down an alley between buildings. rats scatter into the shadows ahead of her. she doesn't seem to notice. all she cares about are the police lights, and the sound of the helicopter droning, circling. she pauses at the mouth of the alley, scanning the well lit street beyond. there are people here: downtown low life street people. a half block away is a brightly lit sign marking the entrance to a red line subway station. she walks along the sidewalk, her eyes on the sign, feeling exposed as she walks openly, her heart pounding. she is a mess, but in this section of town people barely glance at her. low angle on her bare feet, standing out amid the shoes and boots of winter. she crosses the street, and reaches the sidewalk just as a black and white rounds the corner at the end of the block, behind her. in the cruiser are two cops, who are scanning the street. they look intense. revved up. they are burden spreg, a massive, barrel chested street lifer in his mid forties, and dwayne engelman, an aggressive hard on in his twenties with a brush cut, a nautilus body, and a face like a ferret.}

<D>__{no. now.}
<A>__{iris knows the cops are behind her. she is terrified to turn. finally she can't stand it any more. she breaks into a run. the patrol car speeds up suddenly, roaring after her. iris sprints along in her bare feet, all out like a track runner. the black and white screeches to the curb next to her and the cops jump out. iris hits the stairs down to the subway station at a full tilt boogie, knocking down some poor old guy whose groceries go flying.}
