<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{the egg timer in the kitchen rings. georges is seated in front of the window, at a table which is half set for breakfast. he has mobile phone raised to his ear and a phone book opened in front of him. anne is getting up from the table. she goes toward the stove, turns off the gas, takes the egg out of the pan with a spoon and runs it under cold water. like georges, she is still in her robe.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(on the phone)}
<D>__{what about next week? no but still, it would make sense to get it done soon. it might give people silly ideas. and anyway, it's too ugly to look at... wednesday? what time? ok... will you bring the paint with you too, to paint over it? but at least some primer...yes, ok. thank you.}
<A>__{he hangs up.}
<C>__{georges }
<P>__{(to anne)}
<D>__{you can depend on that guy.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(who comes back to the table with the egg)}
<D>__{i hope so. the last time, he kept us waiting for ages, if you remember.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(laughs while acquiescing)}
<D>__{yes, that's true.}
<P>__{(reacting when she places the egg in his egg cup)}
<D>__{thanks. if i call a regular professional, we'll still be waiting two months time.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(more to herself)}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{she has sat down. looks straight ahead. he cracks open his egg, puts salt on it, eats.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{the frodons waited three days when their toilet was blocked. not exactly pleasant.}
<A>__{he eats. wants to put on more salt, but the saltcellar is empty.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{the saltcellar is empty.}
<A>__{he looks up for an instant, as if he expected her to deal with it. as she doesn't react, he realizes the inappropriateness of such an expectation, gets up himself, heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{i don't know if he's going to bring us the cd. maybe he won't come at all. in any case, he didn't mention it. i'd like to buy it. it was really good and i don't want to wait long for it. we could go to virgin this afternoon and buy it. what do you say?}
<A>__{he comes back to the table and sits down again.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{hmmm? anne? what's the matter?}
<A>__{she looks at him and doesn't answer.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{what's going on? what's the matter?}
<A>__{he waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{helllloooo!!! cuckoo!!! i'm here!}
<A>__{she continues to look at him without reacting.}
<C>__{georges }
<P>__{(serious now)}
<D>__{anne! what's going on?}
<A>__{he waits, looks at her. no reaction. he stands up slightly, leans over the table to sit beside her. tries to make her turn toward him.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{anne, what's the matter?}
<A>__{he manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him, but her eyes look through him.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{anne...what's...}
<A>__{he takes her face in both hands and turns toward him.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{anne...}
<A>__{she stares into the void. he drops his hands. then sits beside her, for quite awhile.}
<B>__{silence}
<A>__{finally he gets up, heads for the sink, turns on the tap, wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and places it on anne's face. waits for a reaction that doesn't come. then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and applies the cloth there. then sits down and looks at her imploringly.}
<C>__{georges }
<P>__{(close to tears)}
<D>__{anne...darling...please!}
<A>__{once again they both remain seated. in the background, we hear the gushing of the tap that in his panic he has forgotten to turn it off. making a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time. suddenly, the gushing of the tap stops, which had accompanied us as far as the bedroom. george doesn't notice it immediately, then he stops short.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{anne?}
<A>__{finally he returns, half dressed, into the kitchen. anne is seated in the same place and looks at him.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{she turns toward the breakfast.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{you left the water running.}
<A>__{georges stares at her.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(both aghast and furious)}
<D>__{hey, what's going on? are you completely crazy? is this supposed to be a joke, or what's going on?}
<A>__{she looks at him with amazement.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{is this a joke? is this meant to be a joke?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what joke? i don't get it! why are you talking to me like that? what's got into you?}
<A>__{georges comes from the door to the table.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{anne! please! stop this game. it's not funny.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(getting irritated)}
<D>__{what game, for christ's sake? what on earth's the matter?!!}
<A>__{georges is about to answer in a similarly irritated tone, but gradually begins to suspect that he could be mistaken. he tries to calm down, takes his chair that has remained beside anne, sits down and looks at his wife. she doesn't know how to react.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what's the matter? why didn't you react?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{to what?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{to what? to me, to everything.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{just now. a moment ago.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{please tell me what's wrong. what am i supposed to have done?}
<A>__{georges first looks away reluctantly, then looks at anne. he doesn't want to believe that its serious.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i don't know what to say. do you really not know what just happened?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but what did happen?}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(almost reluctantly bowing his head as he speaks)}
<D>__{you were sitting there, staring at me. you didn't answer me when i asked you what the matter was.}
<A>__{he picks up the wet tea towel from the table.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{i put this tea towel on your face, and you didn't react.}
<A>__{anne looks at the towel, then at georges, and shakes her head, perturbed that she can't understand. georges looks at her. he sees the damp marks on the collar of her robe.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{look... there's still dampness on your collar.}
<A>__{anne follows his gesture, tugs on her collar and sees the damp marks. she slowly grasps that something is awry.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{when... when was it?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{just now, a few minutes ago.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{so...??}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{there's no "so". i went into the bedroom to get dressed. i wanted to get help.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{help?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{yes, and then you turned off the tap.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{yes. because you left it on.}
<B>__{silence}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{neither do i.}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{don't you think it's best if i call dr. bertier?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{why? what can he do?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i don't know. examine you.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i'm fine. there's nothing wrong with me.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{anne, please!! that's absurd. we can't pretend that nothing happened.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but what did happen?}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{i'm here. i'm having my breakfast, and you're telling me things happened that i don't understand.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{can you explain how the tea towel got there?}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{no, i can't!}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{who turned on the tap?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you did!}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{can you remember that?}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(more and more desperate, close to tears)}
<D>__{no i can't! do you want to torture me? leave me in peace!}
<A>__{georges looks at her.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{don't you think it would be better to fetch dr. bertier?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she takes her cup of tea, as if to show how well she is, and drinks it up. when she wants to re fill her cup, she completely misses her aim. she notices it, puts down her cup and bursts into tears.}
