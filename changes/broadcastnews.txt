<DIAL>__{Hi.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?}
<CHAR>__{BOY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Clifford...}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(indicating Tom)}
<DIAL>__{Do you know who this is, Cliff?}
<CHAR>__{BOY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The big joke?}
<ACTION>__{Tom looks at him -- Aaron gives his son a disciplinary nudge.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Lila)}
<DIAL>__{I'll see you back at the hotel.}
<CHAR>__{LILA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(cool)}
<DIAL>__{All right.}
<ACTION>__{He starts off.  She pulls him back for an urgent communication.}
<CHAR>__{LILA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Tom, the speech was magnificent.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, I didn't say anything about your speech.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I appreciate it.}
<LOC>__{INT. WALKWAY - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Tom, Aaron and the boy walking along.  Tom plays with Cliff as they move.  The boy is delighted.  Jane is in a park -- a blanket spread out -- she is wearing shorts and a top -- she has some wine and a small picnic -- a toy for Clifford. She HEARS her name being called.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ON JANE}
<ACTION>__{Shielding her eyes from the sun -- now making out Tom.  As they reach her.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to herself)}
<DIAL>__{Well, why not?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(as they arrive)}
<DIAL>__{Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A picnic?}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.}
<ACTION>__{She hands him a toy.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What do you say, Cliff?}
<ACTION>__{The boy kisses Jane's hand.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He excels at gratitude.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Jane)}
<DIAL>__{Are you any closer to a decision?}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Really?}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Tom)}
<DIAL>__{I'm going to take it.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay...It's so good to see you.}
<ACTION>__{She gives him a quick kiss.  He shakes hands with Aaron.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Aaron)}
<DIAL>__{It's nice to see you.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why?}
<ACTION>__{Tom shuffles uncomfortably.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ON JANE}
<ACTION>__{Smiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the powerful.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Jane as he leaves)}
<DIAL>__{Bye...boss.}
<ACTION>__{Tom walks away.  He's a good twenty yards away when Aaron looks up to see his son running after Tom.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(calling)}
<DIAL>__{Hey!  Cliff!  Cliff!}
<ACTION>__{Tom now notices the boy, leans down and pats him.}
<CHAR>__{TOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Clifford)}
<DIAL>__{Go back to your daddy.}
<ACTION>__{The boy starts back.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come on, Cliff.  Come on.}
<ACTION>__{As Clifford runs back to his father, Aaron sits next to Jane.}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Jane)}
<DIAL>__{So who's the guy?}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.}
<ACTION>__{Aaron laughs at the very notion of Jane finding water sports a lure. Jane deliberately moves past this moment.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?}
<CHAR>__{AARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well -- my wife got this new job...}
<ACTION>__{He continues to talk.  As the two former colleagues catch up, their ease returns, if not their intimacy, as the frame locks and the scene slowly recedes into a black b.g. and we...}
<TRANS>__{FADE OUT:}
