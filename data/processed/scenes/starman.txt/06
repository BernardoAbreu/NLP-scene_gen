<A>__{using only its parking lights, the police car creeps up the dirt road between skeletons of unfinished houses.}
<L>__{interior police car night}
<A>__{the windows are rolled down. periodically one of the men leans out for a better look at the terrain around them.}
<C>__{second officer}
<D>__{smells smoke...}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{i told you.}
<L>__{exterior housing tract night}
<A>__{the police car comes around a curve on the hillside and stops. above them on the next hill, a necklace of embers from a grass fire and a burning tree flicker through the fog. the men get out of the car.}
<C>__{benny}
<P>__{(loud whisper)}
<D>__{there!! up on the hill!!}
<A>__{the officer steps forward for a better look. benny hangs on his shoulder.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{right in line with that burning tree.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{i don't see anything.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{it's there. the fog's thicker now, but it's there. what do you think started those fires?}
<A>__{the officer strains to see through the fog.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{benny, there's nothing there.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{there is. they came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{flew?! oh, come on benny...}
<A>__{the second officer is peering intently at something down among the houses.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{you hear that, mike? now he's telling us...}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{benny and the officer look to where mike is pointing. what appears to be the beam of a powerful headlight bobs among the houses below them. further into the track another beam of light moves slightly from right to left but seems otherwise stationary.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{what did i tell you?}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{probably kids.}
<A>__{one of the lights rises over a house and settles on the other side.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(not convinced)}
<D>__{probably...}
