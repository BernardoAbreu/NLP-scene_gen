<A>__{hawk enters your average, everyday, male strip jointerior a crowd of lusty women cheer on a stripper in a fireman's suit. he dances on a lighted, tile stage under a spinning, mirror ball. hawk shows the man at the door his fake license and the man nods him in. he approaches the bar in the early stages of being very intimidated. the bartender, a man dressed only in tight, black, tuxedo pants, shirt cuffs, and a tie, comes up to hawk.}

<A>__{dicky pats hawk's shoulder and leaves. hawk looks away from amanda and scans the room. he glances back at amanda. she's still gazing at him the way queens of yore must have eyed particularly cute knights. she winks and toasts hawk. hawk raises his glass smiling nervously. they both sip at their drinks. she licks her lips suggestively at him. and, hawk proceeds to cough up his mouthful of jack daniels, spraying it all over the bar.}
