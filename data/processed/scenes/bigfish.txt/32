<L>__{exterior at the old woman's door night}
<A>__{edward helps her back inside. he could leave now, but curiosity gets the better of him.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i was thinking about death and all. about seeing how you're gonna die.}
<A>__{the old woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i mean, on one hand, if dying was all you thought about, it could kind of screw you up. but it could kind of help you, couldn't it? because you'd know that everything else you can survive.}
<A>__{the old woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i guess i'm saying, i'd like to know.}
<A>__{the old woman turns leaning her face right in front of his. and on a silent count of one, two, three edward looks into the eye. this time we don't cut. instead, we hold on edward as he witnesses his death. he stares transfixed, perplexed and amused. whatever he sees, it's not as dire as the other boys. his future has something strange in store.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{huh. that's how i go?}
<A>__{the old woman nods. still a little overwhelmed, edward turns and leaves.}
<C>__{adult edward }
<D>__{from that moment on, i no longer feared death. and for that, i was as good as immortal.}
<A>__{as edward leaves, the door swings shut on its own.}
