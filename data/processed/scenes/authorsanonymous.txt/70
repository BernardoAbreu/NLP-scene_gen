<A>__{members of the writing group struggle to deal with hannah's latest success: alan and colette sit on their living room couch together, wearing matching pajamas, staring straight ahead like zombies. his tape recorder sits on the coffee table. alan reaches for it. she grabs it from his hand and throws it. william sits at the counter of restaurant #2, drumming his fingers on the legal pad, half heartedly trying to write. waitress #3 pours him some more coffee, trying to make eye contact with him. william ignores her. john sits in front of his computer screen, but he can't concentrate. gives up. shuts down computer. flips on tv. another war movie. henry stares absent mindedly at his wall of rejection letters. hannah sits at her computer the only one actually working at the moment but she stops long enough to take a deep, deep sigh. a lot weighs on her mind.}
