<A>__{athos, aramis, and porthos sweep into the now deserted courtyard. silence the last thing they expected stops them in their tracks. the place is a cemetery, haunted by the ghosts of generations of musketeers. porthos is visibly distraught. rochefort enters from behind an archway.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{i will take those tunics, musketeers.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(to aramis)}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{he said he'll take those tunics.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{tunics? coming right up.}
<A>__{porthos reaches inside his cloak and takes out a crumpled red tunic he took from one of the cardinal's guards. he drops it on the ground, digs into a pocket and takes out another. he finds another in his boot and another up his sleeve. there's one in his hat. like a magician, he keeps pulling red tunics out of the most bizarre places. athos and aramis have a few guard tunics themselves. they pull them out and drop them into the growing pile.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i was trying to remember the last time i saw you here. i know. it was the day you were kicked out of the musketeers.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{conduct unbecoming a musketeer. wasn't that the charge?}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{you ought to know. three witnesses stood against me.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{it was the least we could do.}
<A>__{the bitter memory hangs in the air for a moment.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{you are hereby ordered to surrender your commissions and make yourselves available for reassignment in the king's army.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{and if we refuse?}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{you will become outlaws. hunted men.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{it doesn't matter where i go or what i do. sooner or later somebody's calling me 'outlaw.'}
<A>__{athos cuts him off with a look. he's familiar with porthos' propensity for tall tales. but not here, not now. athos turns back to the balcony. rochefort lobs a taunt.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{are you refusing to serve your king?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{we are refusing to serve the cardinal.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{same thing, these days.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{france has one king too many.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{i will tell him you said that.}
<A>__{athos, who has remained silent, speaks with quiet power:}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{do that, rochefort. tell his emminence the cardinal that we will continue to perform our sworn duty to protect the king. from enemies across the sea.}
<C>__{athos }
<D>__{from traitors who sit at his right hand. and tell him that he can take away our tunics, our muskets, even our swords. but he cannot stop us from being what we are. musketeers.}
<A>__{the gauntlet has been thrown. rochefort picks it up with glee.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{i will make sure his emminence the cardinal gets the message. but i can't promise he'll be pleased.}
<A>__{rochefort steps back, disappears into the shadows. a beat. the musketeers regard each other.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{well, if we're going to be outlaws, i suppose we'll have to get our affairs in order.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{are you going to visit them alphabetically or in order of preference?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{alphabetically seems... fair.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{when it comes to you and women, fairness rarely applies.}
<C>__{athos}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{we'll meet at the columbier rouge at sundown.}
<P>__{(off their looks)}
<D>__{to celebrate. and to plan our new lives.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{outlaws.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{citizens of france.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{the three musketeers.}
<A>__{and that is all that remains. athos, porthos, and aramis step in different directions.}
