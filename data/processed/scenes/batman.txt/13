<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior gotham globe city room day}
<A>__{gotham city's leading tabloid daily. copy boys rush to and fro; reporters pound out articles on computer terminals. alexander knox saunters in, a sheath of typed pages in his hand, and pauses at a cartoonist's drawing table.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{what have you got for me, jerry?}
<A>__{jerry holds up a cartoon: a human bat, with an awful, fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit. the caption at the top reads: "have you seen this man?" knox nods in approval.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{nice, but... maybe a little more gore on the fangs, huh?}
<A>__{he pats jerry on the shoulder, moves on. a bespectacled colleague spots him and calls out:}
<C>__{colleague}
<D>__{hey knox, you got a visitor.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{i'm real busy, clark. be a pal and dust him, okay?}
<C>__{colleague}
<D>__{this one you might want to dust yourself.}
<A>__{curiosity piqued, knox moves toward his desk... and stops in his tracks. propped up on the desk are a pair of legs. the legs exceptionally nice ones are attached to a woman leaning back in knox's swivel chair, taking a nap, her face obscured by a big outrageous hat.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{... vicki vale.}
<A>__{the hat tips back. vicki vale, her face framed by a shock of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile. she pulls knox over for a quick smooch and laughs.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{how'd you know it was me?}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{honey i would know any randomly selected square inch of vicki vale.}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{if i had a good enough hinterior}
<A>__{he points at the oversized camera bag on his desk. it bears the monogram "v.v." vicki catches on, makes a face at him.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{where the hell have you been?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{a nice, restful vacation.}
<A>__{she reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of glossy 8x10's: combat photos from some unspecified war torn corner of the world. knox leafs though them, impressed.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{god, a girl could get hurt doing this.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i do get hurt.}
<A>__{she unbuttons her sleeve, rolls it back to show knox a long fresh scar on the inside of her arm. he winces then points to the scar and adds, slyly:}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{got any more of those?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{nothing i'm at liberty to reveal here. what's new and hot in gotham city?}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{it's too good, vick. we got a six foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.}
<C>__{vicki}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{evildoers, huh? big or small?}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{small so far. i mean they don't allow bats in boardrooms, do they.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{speaking of which... i hear the notorious bruce wayne is throwing a big do for the harvey dent campaign.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{yeah. hottest ticket in town. every law'n'order freak in the city's gonna be there.}
<A>__{knox suddenly freezes. it's just occurred to him that vicki may have a purpose in all this.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{wa a it. vicki. you're not saying }
<A>__{she reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an invitation. knox is all but panting with excitement.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{aw, vicki. vicki!}
<P>__{(apprehensively)}
<D>__{got a date?}
<A>__{she flutters her great big eyelashes, shakes her head no. knox grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead, nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{vicki, baby, i love you, i've always loved you. will you marry me?}
<C>__{vicki}
<P>__{(straightening her clothes)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{well, i'm starving. will you at least buy me a hamburger?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{yes, but please be gentle.}
<A>__{overwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm.}
