<L>__{interior racine's apartment night}
<A>__{the lights are out. there's enough moonlight pouring in the open windows to see racine sitting on the bed in his shorts, his back propped against some pillows at the headboard. a fan whirs on a table. he lights another cigarette and takes another drink; a bottle of bourbon sits on his nightstand. from where he sits, he can see the ocean. there is a knock at the door.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{matty }
<D>__{it is me.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{it's open.}
<A>__{matty comes in. she peers into the darkness until she sees him. she locks the door and turns to face him. she is dressed in a pale silk suit and blouse, very carefully put together. she looks as good as she ever has; she seems to create her own light.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{why haven't you answered your phone?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{you took a chance coming here. where's edmund?}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{he's not coming up this weekend. why haven't you answered?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i didn't want to talk. i just wanted to think. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{matty}
<P>__{(nods; then, after a moment)}
<D>__{can i get in with you?}
<A>__{racine just stares at her.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i don't know what heather will tell roz. maybe nothing. maybe she'll be embarrassed or afraid. maybe she'll think she imagined the whole thing.}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(chuckles without humor)}
<D>__{maybe we all did.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{we'll know if she does tell. roz will report to edmund quick enough. it's exactly what she's always wanted.}
<A>__{matty disappears for a moment into the shadows.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i've been thinking, too.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{and what have you got?}
<A>__{matty emerges from the darkness and sits on the edge of the bed next to racine. she looks into his eyes.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i think we should give it up. we haven't done anything criminal, yet.}
<A>__{racine has been thinking along the same lines. he stubs out his cigarette.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{it's not too late to back out.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{that's right. i don't think we can do it.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{things have already started to go wrong. i feel like we got to the edge and looked over and, well, it was too much. we'll just have to live with that. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<A>__{she sits down on the bed.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i will divorce him. and we won't have his money. part of me wants it so bad. i'd be lying if i said i didn't. but it's the worst part of me, the weakest part.}
<A>__{she leans back against him.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{all that matters is that we're together.}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{you don't think i can pull it off.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{it's not you, it's us. i'm sure i will make some mistake.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that's not what you really mean, is it, matty?}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{yes it is.}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(very calm, flat)}
<D>__{no, it isn't. you think he's too much for me. you think i will fuck it up, get us caught.}
<A>__{matty turns toward him.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{no, darling. don't talk that way. it's not true.}
<A>__{racine studies her face.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{no? well that's what i've been thinking.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{you're wrong. don't think that, ever! i know you could do it.}
<P>__{(moving closer)}
<D>__{but all i care about is you. the money doesn't matter.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{it does in this world, the one we're living in. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<A>__{matty presses her head against his chest.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{why torture ourselves about it?}
<A>__{racine laughs; he doesn't know what's funny.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{when's he coming back?}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{friday.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that'll be it, then. nothing will stop us.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{is that what you really want? are you sure?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{yeah. i wasn't before, but i am now.}
<A>__{racine reaches over her, gets another cigarette and lights it. after he takes a deep drag, she takes it from him and takes a puff too.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{this time you're going to know how to reach me. i don't want any more surprises.}
