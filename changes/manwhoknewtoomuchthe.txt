The CAMERA DOLLIES BACK with him as he rather aimlessly makes for the front of the bus,. Having left the Arab village, the bus picks up speed, and is beginning to bump and sway somewhat. When Hank is a little better than half way down the aisle, the bus sways in a particularly startling manner, causing Hank to stagger. In order to steady himself, he thrusts out his hand to grab the side of a seat. He misses the seat, and only succeeds in clutching at the veil of an Arab woman. Unfortunately, he pulls the veil from her face.}

<ACTION>__{Down in the ballroom, Jo is looking up anxiously as she sings. She deliberately breaks and pauses for a moment and softens her accompaniment. Then she hears it -- a faint whistle coming from above, not enough for those around to appreciate it, but loud enough for the straining ears of Jo.

The three are about a dozen steps from the bottom, when suddenly Ben shoots out a hard and pushes Drayton forward. Taken by surprise, he stumbles, and falls down the stairs clumsily.
