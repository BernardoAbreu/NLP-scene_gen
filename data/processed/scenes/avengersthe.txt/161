<L>__{interior hallucinogen hall playroom day}
<A>__{thunder and lightning outside. inside the room of snow shakers, a childhood tune plays. emma shakes the snow scene. the weather seems to grow darker.}
<L>__{160 from behind}
<A>__{emma hears the unmistakable chilling voice:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{i wouldn't shake that too hard. the weather might turn nasty.}
<A>__{from the shadows ... a man. a silhouette. behind a distorting lens. his shape and face unclear. emma puts down the shaker.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{quite a collection.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{if nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. butterflies. old china. penny farthings. a true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.}
<A>__{outside the big window the weather is turning nasty ...}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{your voice it's so familiar ...}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{we have met ...}
<A>__{from the shadows, a man moves out, revealing: peter peel, emma's husband! thunder.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{peter ... ?}
<A>__{instinctively emma moves towards him. a long pause.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i must be dreaming ...}
<A>__{emma pulls back. before she can turn, peter takes her hand, places it over his heart. ba boom, ba boom, ba boom ...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{listen... very much alive.}
<A>__{peter touches her hand. emma looks into his eyes. intrigued but alarmed, disbelief. peter raises her hand to his lips.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{darling, it's me...}
<A>__{emma shudders, battles with herself.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{peter ...}
<A>__{emma is tempted, yet filled with terror.}
