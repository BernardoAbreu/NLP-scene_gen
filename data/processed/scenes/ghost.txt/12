<A>__{she nods and presses her hands into a pot that is forming in front of her. sam watches the sensual movement of her fingers, molding and forming the clay. she is forceful, assured, gifted. the clay responds to her slightest effort. slowly, almost unconsciously, sam reaches for her shoulders and begins kissing them.}

<D>__{you notice carl's eyes today? they were all over you.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{what? are you jealous? sam, let me tell you something. he's not even looking at me. it's you he idolizes. he doesn't see me at all... anyway, he's not my type.}

<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i feel inspired.}
<A>__{his hands dig into the clay. molly smiles. their fingers seem to dance together. after a moment, she reaches up to him, her clay covered fingers streaking his face and curving down to his chest. sam grins and reaches down to her.}
