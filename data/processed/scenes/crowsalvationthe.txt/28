<L>__{interior garrison prison morgue night}
<A>__{inside the locker. a human eye blinks. barely visible in the darkness. alex kicks with a yell and... in the morgue. the locker door flies open and alex spills onto the floor. gropes a few seconds on hands and knees before a shadow passes over him evoking a primitive response. he cowers, looks up at... a large crow flutters through the bars of a high window, lands near him on the floor. it looks at him, then flaps its way up to the autopsy countertop, cocks its head. follow me. alex strains to pull himself up on the gurney that brought him here. his pov as he slowly rises above the gurney the crow in front of a mirror over the splash sink. it flies off, revealing alex's reflection. charred. hideous. alex drops back to the floor with a scream. turns, sees himself in a stainless door and smashes it with his fist... the bashed stainless door the word "morgue," painted on the wall behind alex, brought into focus at the center of the concavity. alex thrashes, trying to avoid his reflection, but the dim mirrors have him surrounded. the crow flaps down, crazed too, as if in empathy. cawing loudly, finally getting alex's attention. alex settles, hazards another look at his reflection in stainless steel. his body looks less misshapen now. he looks at his arms, hands, no longer burned. pulls himself up on the gurney again, cautiously. over alex as he slowly rises above the gurney a second time, looks in the mirror. his body miraculously healed, covered by shredded clothing. his face obscured by the meltdown helmet. he slowly approaches the mirror on unsteady feet.}

<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{alex starts to tear away the helmet and gets a first frightening flash as his fingers touch it... alex's internal pov flashback a blitz return to his own execution. the copper screen, the helmet lowered into place. electro spasm. the faintest glimpse of a jagged scar seen darkly. resume alex clutching the helmet on his head, ripping it off in one painful overcranked movement and... over alex, in the mirror it's alex, and yet not. his face marked with the crow mask, jagged warpaint where the melted helmet ran down his face. an indelible reminder of the botched execution. he stares at himself for a couple of deep breaths. then wham! shatters the mirror with a martial punch. the fractured mirror alex's mask reflected in shards as his busy hands remove certain pieces of broken glass. his purpose unclear.}
