<L>__{interior margo's bedroom night}
<A>__{margo's asleep. a bedside clock with a luminous dial reads 3 a.m. exactly. the phone rings. her head comes up out of the pillow, she shakes it. she fumbles, switches on a lamp, then picks up the phone.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{hello..}
<C>__{operator's voice}
<D>__{we are ready with your call to beverly hills...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{call, what call?}
<C>__{operator's voice}
<D>__{it this templeton 89970? miss margo channing?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{that's right, but i don't understand }
<C>__{operator's voice}
<D>__{we are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, california time, to mr. william sampson in beverly hills...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i placed...?}
<C>__{operator's voice}
<D>__{go ahead, please...}
<C>__{bill's voice}
<P>__{(a loud, happy squawk)}
<D>__{margo! what a wonderful surprise!}
<A>__{margo jumps at his vehemence. as she does so, the screen wipes down diagonally left to right, so that margo remains in the lower right hand diagonal of the screen and bill is disclosed in the upper left. he, too, is in bed, reading. his clock says midnight.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what a thoughtful, ever lovin' thing to do }
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(dazed)}
<D>__{bill? have i gone crazy, bill?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you're my girl, aren't you?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{that i am...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{then you're crazy.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(nods in agreement)}
<D>__{when when are you coming back?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i leave in a week the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. like opening out of town, but terrifying. there's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{ in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a navajo blanket, i want you home...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you in a hurry?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{a big hurry, be quick about it so good night, darling, and sleep tight...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{wait a minute! you can't hang up, you haven't even said it }
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{bill, you know how much i do but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, i want to heat it and if you won't say it, you can sing it...}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(convinced she's gone mad)}
<D>__{sing it?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{sure! like the western union boys used to do...}
<A>__{margo's eyes pop. her jaw and the phone sag.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{bill... bill, it's your birthday.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{and who remembered it? who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?}
<A>__{margo knows damn well it wasn't she.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(miserably)}
<D>__{happy birthday, darling...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the reading could have been better, but you said it now "many happy returns of the day..."}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(the same)}
<D>__{many happy returns of the day...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i get a party, don't i?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll i ask?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{it's no secret, i know all about the party eve wrote me...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{she did...?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{she hasn't missed a week since i left but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, i sent her a list of people to ask check with her.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{yeah... i will.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{how is eve? okay?}
<C>__{margo}

<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i love you too. good night, darling }
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{see you...}
<A>__{margo hangs up. bill hangs up. he replaces the phone, picks up his book... slow wipe until only margo is on screen. she puts her phone away. she gets a cigarette. she lights it. she rolls over on her back...}
