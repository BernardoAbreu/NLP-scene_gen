<L>__{interior bishop's house. day}
<A>__{a landing at the top of a crooked, wooden staircase. there is a threadbare, braided rug on the floor. there is a long, wide corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and battleships. the wallpapers are sun bleached and peeling at the corners except for a few newly hung strips which are clean and bright. a small easel sits stored in the corner. outside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling the gutters. a ten year old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully eating a bowl of cereal as he walks. he is lionel. lionel slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window. he takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove. a child's voice says over the speaker:}
<C>__{record player }
<D>__{in order to show you how a big symphony orchestra is put together, benjamin britten has written a big piece of music, which is made up of smaller pieces that show you all the separate parts of the orchestra.}
<A>__{as lionel listens, three other children wander out of their bedrooms and down to the landing. the first is an eight year old boy in a bathrobe. he is murray. the second is a nine year old boy in white boxer shorts and a white undershirt. he is rudy. the third is a twelve year old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee high socks and brightly polished, patent leather shoes. she is suzy. she carries a one month old striped kitten. the boys drop down to the floor next to their brother. they lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their fists, listening. suzy sits in the windowsill. she opens a book called shelly and the secret universe. there is an illustration on the cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her neck. suzy starts to read then pauses. she lowers her book. she raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes. she looks out into the rain.}
