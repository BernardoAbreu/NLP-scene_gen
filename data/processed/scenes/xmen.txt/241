<L>__{interior logan's room later day}
<A>__{from behind logan we see him finish putting something on over his head. logan turns into frame, he is wearing a dark blue mask. it fits his head neatly. the sides arch up shadowing his ears, giving him a wolf or fox like appearance. the shape is reminiscent of logan's sketch the wolverine. logan stands facing a mirror. the mask looks good on him and he seems to know it. xavier is in the doorway. logan pulls off the mask, embarrassed.}
