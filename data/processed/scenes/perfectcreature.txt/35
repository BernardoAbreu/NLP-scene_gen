<D>__{there is no precedent for brother edgar's behavior. no brother has ever taken a human life, not in the 300 years since we began. not one. our role has been to preserve and maintain the human life. not take it.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{next he'll be wanting an fucking medal.}
<A>__{silus stares directly at jones now. their eyes lock. silus continues, perfectly calm.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{what i am saying to you is that brother edgar's behavior is aberrant. we}
<C>__{silus}
<P>__{(cont)}
<D>__{don't understand it. and therefore it's difficult to predict. the only thing we know is where he will strike nexterior}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<A>__{silus moves to the desk next to him. he passes something to another cop who now sits at the desk. we see lilly now. the look on her face tells us that she knows what is coming and she's not looking forward to it. we see what silus gave the cop. an audio tape. the cop places the tape in a tape deck. he then switches it on. he then turns the volume knob on an amplifier which now directs static hiss to two big speakers. we see the faces of the cops, all listening in the dim light coming from the slide projector. above the level of the hissing tape there is another noise. it is a wet sound. like a cat would make if it were lapping up milk. an another sound. like an animal, moaning with pleasure. we see the cops; some of them are beginning to twig. and there is another noise. it is a man; moaning.}
<C>__{man on the tape}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{please. please don't hurt me.}
<A>__{we see jones and dominic. their glares say it all. and then another voice.}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(off, like to a lover)}
<D>__{quiet.}
<C>__{man on the tape}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{please...}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{i said shut up!}
<A>__{then we hear a punch and then noises which can only be described as sounding like a dog killing something. jones springs out of his seat.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{fuck!}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{jones, sit down.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{why are we listening to this?!}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{quiet!}
<A>__{jones stands there enraged. dominic pulls him down back into his chair. all the cops are appalled by what they have heard. and then a voice.}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{good. now you're quiet.}
<A>__{we can hear edgar moving around.}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(continuing; off)}
<D>__{did you hear that silus? i hope so.}
<A>__{we see silus, listening as intently as everyone else.}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(continuing; off)}
<D>__{the next one will be tomorrow. there is a square, bridge square it's called. i will take the next one from there. you should try harder this time. please try harder...}
<A>__{more moving around, then the sound on the tape cuts out. we are left with only tape hiss. everyone stares at silus.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he sent this to you. specifically.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{we share the same mother. there is a bond.}
<A>__{the cops all stare at silus' emotionless response.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{there will be two teams. frank, i want you and abernathy up in the buildings around bridge square.}
<A>__{frank nods.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i will lead the other team with dominic, jones and queen's imperial guard in support. no guns, batons only.}
