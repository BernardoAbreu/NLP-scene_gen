<L>__{interior loft building night}
<A>__{... a drab entrance hall, dimly lit signs identifying various commercial tenants a pink on black placard reading macalbertson, two flights up. joe has started up before he notices ratso, leaning on the bannister at the foot of the stairs, struggling to catch his breath. his face and hair are wet with perspiration, his lips lavender blue. in swift flashes intercut joe reads the panic in ratso's eyes, so intense that joe shares it, unable to speak or offer reassurance.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{better dry your hair some. you sweating all over the goddam place.}
<A>__{joe pulls out his shirttail, grabs ratso by the neck and rubs his head dry.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{you got a comb?}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{don't need a comb.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.}
<A>__{joe hands ratso his own comb. ratso swipes at his tangled hair angrily until two teeth break in the comb. he hands the comb back, tugs at his hair with his fingers, pats it in place, then looks back into joe's eyes.}

<D>__{okay? i look okay?}
<A>__{in a moment of silence, distant sounds can be heard a siren, the grinding teeth of a garbage truck, the twang of an electric guitar upstairs at the party then ratso makes a quick gesture of impatience and starts up the stairs, pulling himself on the bannister.}
