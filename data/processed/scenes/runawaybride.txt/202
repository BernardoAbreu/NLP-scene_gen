<L>__{exterior central park reservoir dusk}
<A>__{ike stares out at water as he walks.}
<L>__{exterior ike's apartment building night}
<A>__{ike walks along sidewalk, crosses street, enters his building.}
<L>__{interior ike's apartment night}
<A>__{ike opens the door to his apartment and flicks on the lights. he crosses to hang his coat in the closet. in the closet mirror, he sees and is stunned to find: maggie, sitting on the couch holding italics, the cat.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{hello, ike. he closes the closet and crosses to his desk.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{don't tell me. my doorman is one of your many admires... i knew i should have given him a better christmas gift. maggie smiles tenuously. she's more than a little terrified.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i've been making friends with your cat.}
<P>__{(then)}
<A>__{is it okay that i'm here?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i don't have much choice in the matter now, do i? but i can't speak for italics.}
<P>__{(to cat)}
<A>__{traitor! he moves to the kitchen.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i don't blame you for being mad... ike looks at her. apparently the word "mad" is an understatement.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{... or... furious. ike looks at her again.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{... irate? livid? how's that? he starts putting cat food in a bowl. the cat leaves maggie's side and starts to east.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{livid is good. so what is it, maggie? you here on business? i saw your lamps. they're terrific.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{it's something i've always wanted to do. ike leaves the kitchen, turns on the balcony lights and re enters the living room from the balcony.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{you actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.}
<P>__{(after opening the glass doors)}
<A>__{so, what are you doing here?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i wanted to talk to you about why i run or ride away from things. ike moves away from her and sits on the steps near the balcony window, listening.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(after sitting)}
<A>__{does it matter?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i think so... when i was walking down the aisle? i was walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who i really was. and it was only half the other person's fault, because i had done everything to convince him that i was exactly what he wanted. so it was good that i didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you you knew the real me.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{yes, i did.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i didn't. and you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that. ike takes this in. she's reaching him but then the defenses go back up. he turns to her.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{no, i couldn't fix anything...}
<P>__{(as he gets up)}
<A>__{but i still ended up chasing a truck. ike moves out to the balcony. after a moment, maggie follows him.}
