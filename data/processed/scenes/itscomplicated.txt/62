<L>__{interior courtyard}
<A>__{jane and jake stand in the courtyard off of the living room.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what is it, jake? what?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i don't get not calling me back.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{`cause i don't care what your excuse is.}
<P>__{(shuts the door to the living )}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{she didn't go out, jane. she cancelled her plans and every time i tried to call or write, she caught me. i wanted to be here.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you know what, jake? you were worried about rocking the boat at home? well now you're rocking my boat and i don't like it.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(stopping her)}
<D>__{honey, don't let one night...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you don't understand. i'm not even blaming you. i fully participated in this. but i don't want to do it anymore. the last thing in the world i should be right now is your mistress, sitting around at nine at night wearing heels and perfume and blowing out candles and wrapping everything in saran wrap because your wife cancelled her plans. it was cliche and humiliating.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(wistfully)}
<D>__{you lit candles?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{oh, shut up. look, i've had a pretty good life these past 10 years. i figured it out and i moved on. i no longer feel alone or divorced. i just feel normal. you know how long that took, just to get my balance back?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{the point is, i'm going in the wrong direction here. but the worst part is... it's feeling like it used to feel. all the little untruths that are hard to catch but add up...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{ janey, c'mon, it was one mistake...}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(joining them)}
<D>__{ everything okay out here?}
<P>__{(jane and jake turn)}
<D>__{the kids are gettin' hungry...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yeah. we're done.}
<P>__{(walks away, pauses in front of harley)}
<D>__{we were just...}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(as she passes)}
<D>__{ none of my beeswax, jane.}
<P>__{(once she's gone)}
<D>__{and please never tell me.}
<A>__{lauren joins.}
<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{nothin', punky.}
<P>__{(rubs her arm)}
<C>__{lauren}
<P>__{(taking jake back inside)}
<D>__{yeah? so, we're going to see you tomorrow night, for sure, right?}
<A>__{harley starts to follow them out when jane grabs his shirt sleeve.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{okay...what did you see and what do you know?}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{nothing. really.}
<A>__{jane gives him a look that could get blood from a stone.}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(confesses rapidly)}
<D>__{okay, he checked in, you arrived, you met in the elevator, possible kiss there, doctor went up, doctor came down, thumbs up. that's it. have no idea what happened in between.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(dying...)}
<D>__{have you told lauren?}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{no and i won't }
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(joining them)}
<D>__{mom. dad's leaving...}
