<L>__{int guard station outer office day (1955)}
<A>__{andy wrestles the phonograph player onto the guards' desk, sweeping things onto the floor in his haste. he plugs the machine in. a red light warms up. the platter starts spinning. he slides the mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the platter, and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut. the needle hisses in the groove...and the music begins, lilting and gorgeous. andy sinks into wiley's chair, overcome by its beauty. it is "deutino: che soave zeffiretto," a duet sung by susanna and the contessa.}
