<A>__{she begins to moan as he digs out the pain. he is fighting against the erotic charge of this, trying to keep it medicinal, but he's got his hands all over her naked back, and she is moaning so he stops and takes a breath.}
<C>__{catch}

<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{oh, jesus!}
<A>__{but we see her eyes turn inward toward the old pain and, for once, she shares it.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{my father used to knock us around, all of us. but i'm the one who called the cops finally.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{they say i turned against the family.}
<A>__{catch works in silence a while, absorbing this, looking at sharon with more tenderness than ever. in a moment...}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{but... they invited you.}

<A>__{sharon is considering his words, but she's also deep in her old pain, defensive, challenging.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you close with your family?}
<A>__{that hits him, but he keeps rubbing her, gentle now, looking a little lost. he doesn't answer.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{see? so why should i listen to you?}
<A>__{but as he works her back in silence, we see her facing her pain and thinking through it.}
