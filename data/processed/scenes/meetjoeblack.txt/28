<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{thank you. would you like the man's name?}
<C>__{joe}

<A>__{parrish glances around, a room in which the occupant could not want for anything.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{if there is anything else, don't hesitate }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i won't.}

<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{when you go, i go.}
<C>__{joe}

<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{...i just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{your doctor?}
<P>__{(icily)}
<D>__{did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta? did he mention an irreparab ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain? were they any prognostications about the possibil ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart of suffocating in an avalanche on a skin vacation in gstaad?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i hope you realize, bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.}
<C>__{parrish}

<A>__{parrish keeps still, trying to cool the heat of joe's temper.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{...but meanwhile, you are still here. count your blessings. call it gravy, frosting on the cake, whatever it is you say.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{well, thank you for letting me know.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{not at all.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{and uh i guess, 'goodnight'.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{good night to you, bill.}
<A>__{parrish gently closes the door. joe looks around, checks out his surroundings: curious, attentive.}
