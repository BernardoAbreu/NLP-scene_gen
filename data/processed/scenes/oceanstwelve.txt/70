<A>__{a male secretary (hess) rushes through europol's extraordinary richard meier designed headquarters.}
<L>__{interior auditorium day}
<A>__{europol agent isabel lahiri gives a presentation to seventy five of her colleagues. with her on stage are a couple of seated higher up types. she's nervous.}

<D>__{let's discuss, briefly and to begin, with the category of "thieves", as distinguished from the larger category of what might be termed "hardened" criminals. the highest level, "master thieves," if you will, is a very small world. between six and ten high level crews are operating in europe at any given time. worldwide, no more than twenty. the most famous, gaspar lemarc, is either dead or retired, and the expectation is that no one will replace him. the good news is the trend is toward their extinction.}

<D>__{for example: anecdotal evidence suggest these people are personally insufferable.}
<A>__{the higher ups look at each other; what did she just say?}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{their egos demand constant praise, and they embellish their exploits to anyone who will listen. they tell their own stories endlessly, provided of course, they are talking to a fellow thief or an intimate.}
<A>__{many in the audience are now looking to each other, wondering if this is appropriate.}

<A>__{one of the higher ups convinces the other to say something, but by now hess the male secretary has reached isabel and interrupts her by whispering into her ear. she balances.}
