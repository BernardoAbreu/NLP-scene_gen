<L>__{interior subway. afternoon.}
<A>__{truman sits by himself in the rattling subway car, defeated. the only other occupants in the train, a tall woman, mid thirties, reading a pulp novel and two male youths, late teens, sitting opposite the woman, slouching, ogling her.}
<C>__{youth 1}
<P>__{(to woman)}
<D>__{you wanna read to me?}
<A>__{his companion smirks.}
<C>__{youth 1}
<P>__{(more insistent)}
<D>__{you wannna read to me?}
<A>__{the woman looks up, unaware of the boys' presence until now. she quickly avoids eye contact and returns to the book. the other boy reaches over and snatches the novel from her grasp.}
<C>__{youth 2}
<P>__{(menacing)}
<D>__{my friend asked you a question.}
<A>__{the woman picks up her bag from the floor in a reflex and holds it to her. she looks around the train for assistance, briefly catching truman's eye. the youths also look in truman's direction, staring him down, daring him to interfere. truman quickly averts his gaze.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(reaching for the book)}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{the boy returns the book to the woman, but before doing so rips out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his shirt pocket.}
<C>__{youth 2}
<D>__{now you're gonna have to ask me how it ends.}
<A>__{the train pulls into a deserted station. feeling vulnerable, the woman jumps up from her seat and exits. the youths, sensing a chase, also exit. scanning the empty platform, the woman realizes she has made a serious error. truman watches through the train's open door as the boys corner the frightened woman but still he remains in his seat.}
<C>__{youth 1}
<D>__{we're gonna tell you how it ends, baby.}
<A>__{one of the youths produces a knife from his pocket and waves it in the woman's face.}
<C>__{youth 2}
<D>__{don't you wanna know how it ends?}
<A>__{the boys pin the woman to the station wall with the weight of their bodies. the woman looks again in truman's direction. again she makes eye contact, eyes pleading.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{help!! please, help!!}
<A>__{the woman's second scream is muffled as the train door closes. truman looks up to the emergency handle beside the door. there is still time to act. he stands up and half reaches for the handle but moves no further. the train abruptly pulls away, leaving truman time to see one of the youths covering the woman's mouth while the other reaches under her skirt before the train enters the tunnel. truman bows his head in shame as the train rattles on.}
