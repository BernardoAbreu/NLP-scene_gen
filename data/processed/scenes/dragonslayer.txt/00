<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{castle night now comes the moon riding over the horizon. upon a hill at the edge of the wood squats a castle, its crude stonework bathed in cold silvery light. queer carvings and runes decorate the ponderous gate. heavy vines are climbing up the walls. the castle is old, its unfamiliar form testament to an ancient mind and an ancient craft. flickering candle light dances on a leaded windowpane. inside, the corridors are dark and silent. under low arched ceilings the uneven floors are paved with stone blocks. perched over lintels and crouched in niches are icons with strange animal heads.}
<B>__{hodge}
<A>__{a sleep on a straw palette in a room strewn with vegetables and crockery is hodge, a wrinkled old retainer. a flickering candle and empty jug are beside the bed. he is snoring gently.}
<B>__{conjuring room}
<A>__{this circular chamber at the heart of the castle is stuffed with parchments, scrolls, dusty books, bronze braziers, glass retorts, chemical salts, birds both stuffed and caged. an iron candelabra stands on a work table, tapers burning. in the soft glow it seems that the room is unoccupied, but no, moving in the background is a shadowy figure, preparing for a magical deed. feet are positioned carefully within a pentagram chiseled into the floor. a scroll is consulted; up comes an arm and a voice blurts out:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{omnia in duos: duo in unum: unus in nihil: haec nec quattuor nec omnia nec duo nec unus nec nihil sunt.}
<A>__{nothing happens.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{come on, candles, out!}
<A>__{but the little flames stand at attention without so much as a tremble.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{in volunta divina et verbum magi: lux! exstinguat!}
<A>__{it's no use. there is a sigh and the figure moves forward into the light. revealed in the glow is the discouraged face of galen bradwardyn, sorcerer's apprentice.}
<B>__{tower}
<A>__{carrying the candelabra, the youth trudges up a circular staircase.}
<B>__{turret}
<A>__{the highest point of the castle is a turret, open to the stars and the night air. here, more magic is afoot. an old enchanter, ulrich, magister ipsissimus, pours water from a silver ewer into a stone bowl. as the surface ripples disappear he leans forward and gazes into the pool. all at once his face hardens as the distant sounds of screams and thunder reach his ears. lights and shadows, reflected from within the basin, play across his face. his frown deepens as the sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision in the water draco draconis suddenly squelched by the roar of flame and an ugly snarl. at that moment galen reaches the top of the steps and holds up the candelabra.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{vide, magister. there's something wrong.}
<A>__{ulrich, startled from his trance, slaps the water out of the basin and turns to confront his student. galen is taken aback by the old man's grim countenance.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{what's the matter? what's happened?}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{i've just seen something. something of consequence to you.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{to me?}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(calm)}
<D>__{yes. my own death.}
<A>__{with a distracted gesture he causes the flames to extinguish themselves.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{perhaps we had better hasten your training.}
