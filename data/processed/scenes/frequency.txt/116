<D>__{tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.}
<A>__{as karen moves to the cash register, the camera widens to reveal frank, awkwardly pretending to read a magazine. frank readies to follow her when he suddenly trips over a crate of vegetables and goes down on one knee. karen looks in the direction of the accident, and for a split second, her eyes lock with frank's. embarrassed, frank looks away as he rights himself. frank edges out of the grocery store as karen steps into the street and dodges traffic towards a corner bar restaurant at the end of the block, past a heavily overgrown vacant lot. frank follows karen across the street and finds himself, just as karen enters the bar, at a point near the murder site described by john. he pauses to stare at it.}
