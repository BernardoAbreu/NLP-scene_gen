<D>__{i mean a human investment, rose, we care about you, you matter to us. but we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. do you hear me?}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(meekly)}

<P>__{(a bit overwhelmed by daddy)}
<D>__{she hasn't actually done anything...}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(very firmly)}
<D>__{just a moment, dear.}
<P>__{(turns to rose and almost sadly)}
<D>__{we can't have it, rose. can you behave yourself or not? that is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee that is the coil shuffling question.}
<P>__{(a dramatic pause, then points at her)}
<D>__{if you can't behave i am going to fire you and i say it in front of you and mrs. hillyer and i mean it. i point my rigid finger right at your nose, rose, and i stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and i tell you... this is a final warning. do you hear me?}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(very meekly)}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
