<A>__{the real location corresponding to that seen on the map and seen from the same angle. it is evening, and along the street comes leon on his way to the hotel. the camera pans with him as he crosses the street. he reaches the isle of safety and there passes ninotchka, who has come from the other side. they pass on the little isle without noticing each other. suddenly we hear the whistle of a traffic policeman and both ninotchka and leon have to step back to the little isle. close shot ninotchka and leon on the little isle. wanting some information ninotchka turns to him completely impersonal.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you, please.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{me?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{yes. could you give me some information?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{gladly.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{how long do we have to wait here?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{well until the policeman whistles again.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{at what intervals does he whistle?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{how many minutes between the first and second whistle?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{that's funny. it's interesting. i never gave it a thought before.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{have you never been caught in a similar situation?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{have i? do you know when i come to think about it it's staggering. if i add it all up i must have spent years waiting for signals. imagine! an important part of my life wasted between whistles.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{in other words you don't know.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{ninotchka gets out her map, starts to unfold it.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you might hold this for me.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{love to.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(engrossed in her geography)}
<D>__{correct me if i am wrong... we are facing north, aren't we?}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{facing north... i'd hate to commit myself without my compass... pardon me... are you an explorer?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{no... i am looking for the eiffel tower.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{is that thing lost again?... listen... if you are interested in a view...}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i am interested in the eiffel tower from a technical standpointerior}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{technical... i couldn't help you from that angle. you see, a real parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{how long does it take a man to land?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{now, isn't that too bad! the last time i jumped i forgot to clock it!}
<P>__{(looks at map)}
<D>__{let me see... eiffel tower... your finger, please.}
<A>__{he takes her finger and points to the map with it.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(skeptically)}
<D>__{why do you need my finger?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{bad manners to point with your own... here... the eiffel tower.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{and where are we?}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(shifting her finger back to the hotel)}
<D>__{here... here we are... here you are and here i am... feel it?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. must you flirt?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i don't have to but i find it natural.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{suppress it.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i will try.}
<A>__{ninotchka starts to fold her map.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{for my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{madame, it is that kind of approach which has made paris what it is.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you are very sure of yourself, aren't you?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. it is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{a russian! i love russians! comrade... i have been fascinated by your five year plan for the past fifteen years!}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{your type will soon be extinct.}
<A>__{she walks away from him coldly. leon stares after her, fascinated. entrance ground floor of the eiffel tower}
