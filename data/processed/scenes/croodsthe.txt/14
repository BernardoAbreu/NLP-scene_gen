<L>__{exterior rock arch night}
<A>__{eep steps into a small clearing. stuck in the ground, is a torch. as far as eep knows, this is the thing she was following. eep crouches down and cautiously approaches. reverse angle eep can feel the heat from the fire on the palms of her hands and her face. tense. exciting. but camouflaged against the rock wall behind her, something moves. a warthog creature stands upright and creeps up behind her. eep reaches out to touch the flame. the torch blows away from her. the wind has changed direction. the breeze at her back, eep smells the creature behind her. on her face, awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs the creature. she throws and flips it over her shoulder. it hits the torch, knocking it to the ground. eep jumps back, grabbing a good sized rock she's poised to bash the creature's brains in.}
