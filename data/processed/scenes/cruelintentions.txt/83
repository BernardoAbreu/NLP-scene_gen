<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's just upsetting. you're in love with her. you don't love me anymore.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{oh come on, kathryn, it was just a contest.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{at first it was, but now it's become something bigger.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{kathryn, you know i love you. i've always loved you.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{not anymore you don't. it's obvious.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i can't believe you're reacting this way. you're just saying this because you lost the bet.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{is that what you think?}
<A>__{he nods. kathryn sits down on his bed. she slips her underwear off from under her bathrobe and tosses it aside, spreading her legs.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{alright, come on, let's get it over with. but mark my words, this is the only time it'll happen.}
<A>__{she picks up the phone.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{whenever you're ready. just stick it in me. while you're doing that i'm gonna make some phone calls.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{that's not fair. you're taking all the fun out of it.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{then do me a favor and get rid of her. if not for me, then do it for you. look at yourself. you're a joke. she's turned you into jelly. what do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. people used to respect you. they feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.}
<A>__{sebastian stares at her, lost in thought.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{poor sebastian. he used to be cool, but now he's just another love struck faggot. one of the many.}
