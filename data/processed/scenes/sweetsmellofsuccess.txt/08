<L>__{interior robard's club night}
<A>__{robard is a stolid, secure man, balding and with a moustache. he has a morose sense of humor. he is speaking from a telephone on a little desk at the end of the bar. in background, the club is open, but there are few customers as yet. some recorded jazz is being played while the musicians are still arriving, strolling past in background, depositing their overcoats and music cases in the little closet assigned to them.}
<C>__{robard}
<P>__{(in answer to sidney)}
<D>__{of course.}
<P>__{(he listens to protest from sidney)}
<D>__{what is this, sidney, a kissing game? you're a liar that's a publicity man's nature. i wouldn't hire you if you wasn't a liar. i pay you a c and a half a week wherein you plant big lies about me and the club all over the map.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{yeah, i mean in that sense. but also in the sense that you are a personal liar, too, because you don't do the work i pay you for.}
<P>__{(new protests on the other end of the line)}
<D>__{oh, stop it, sidney. you're from the country, not me.}
<B>__{resume sidney}
<A>__{sally is watching him, unhappy on his behalf.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(to phone)}
<D>__{now, wait a minute, joe. when i saw j.j. last night he said...}
<A>__{but robard has cut off. sidney hangs up. a silence. sally tries to be comforting.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i wish i could help in some way, sidney.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(aggressively)}
<D>__{help me with two minutes of silence!}
<A>__{sally, hurt, says nothing. presently, he adds:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{go home, sally. it's late...}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i hate to see you like this }
<A>__{sidney, with another mercurial change of manner, begins some sarcastic clowning.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(horsing around)}
<D>__{yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books. and if you mail the enclosed card within ten days }
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(pleadingly)}
<D>__{sidney, i know you by now. don't do a dance with me...}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(still clowning)}
<D>__{you mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(distressed)}
<D>__{sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...}
<A>__{sidney is abruptly savage.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(with cruelty)}
<D>__{so what'll you do if i feel nervous? you'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(breaking down)}
<D>__{sid...you got me so...i don't know what...}
<A>__{she is crying. sidney feels uncomfortable. not too generously, he relents:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you ought to be used to me by now.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(pathetically)}
<D>__{i'm used to you...}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(with a touch of bitterness)}
<D>__{no. you think i'm a hero. i'm no hero. i'm nice to people where it pays me to be. i gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow tow in my own office. i'm in a bind right now with hunsecker so }
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{every dog has his day!}
<P>__{(going)}
<D>__{lock up and leave the key.}
<A>__{the phone rings. sidney is dressed by now. as sally goes for it, he makes for the outer door.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{if that's for me, tear it up!}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{take a top coat.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{and leave a tip in every hat check room in town?}
<A>__{he is already gone as she picks up the phone.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{sidney falco office... oh, miss kay, he tried to reach you. no, he's at the barbers now. no, that's held over till the tuesday column...}
