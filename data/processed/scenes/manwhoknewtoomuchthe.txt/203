<L>__{interior claridge's suite (day) med. shot}
<A>__{ben hangs up, and turns to the group. he tries to be as casual as possible. he picks up the note from louis bernard, and the one on which the address of ambrose chappell is written and shoves them into his pocket. he rises to meet his guests.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{see. we could have talked.}
<C>__{j0}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{that's what i told you.}
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(to group)}
<D>__{i'd like everyone to meet my husband.}
<A>__{ben volunteers his hand to val parnell, while nodding at mrs. parnell.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(takes his hand)}
<D>__{i've heard so much about you, doctor, it's nice to see you in person.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you look just like, those pictures jo had in her dressing room four years ago. haven't changed a bit.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{why should he? he's a doctor. probably gets free hormones.}
<A>__{everyone laughs, including ben and jo.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{and this one is jan peterson who sing almost as well as i do, but can handle those legs like nijinsky.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i can believe it. how do you do, jan.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{when nijinsky got off the stage he was through with his footwork. that's just when mine begins.}
<A>__{laughter again.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{and cindy fontaine, the most wonderful expatriate i've ever known.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(nods to her)}
<D>__{haven't you been home recently?}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{how can i go back to harrisburg? they know me there as elva macduff}
<P>__{(shake's her head, pats her wide hips)}
<D>__{cindy. it doesn't fit any more.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{where's your boy? i'd like to see which one you he looks like.}
<A>__{all momentary gaiety goes from jo's face, and ben has a hard time appearing nonchalant.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{he he's staying with some other people so we can have a little time to ourselves.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{what's his name?}
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(tonelessly)}
<D>__{hank. henry, really.}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{i hope he has your looks, and the doctor's brains.}
<A>__{jo turns away toward the flowers.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{thank you again for the beautiful flowers.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i'm taking orders for drinks.}
<A>__{he looks around.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{okay. but dinner tonight's on me.}
<A>__{jo turns around to look at him, disturbed, almost to the point of alarm. a carefree dinner is something she just couldn't go through.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{room service, please.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{a welcome home for jo.}
<P>__{(smiles at her)}
<D>__{and i wish i could persuade her to stay a month.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{oh, val i wish i could, but...}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(to val)}
<D>__{will you order the stuff?}
<A>__{he starts toward the door, pausing to pat jo comfortingly on the shoulder.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i will be back in a little while.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{aren't you going to wait for a drink, doctor.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{thank you, but i will catch up when i get back.}
<A>__{ben starts for the door.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{ben!}
