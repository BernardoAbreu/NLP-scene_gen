<ACTION>__{They all laugh.}
<CHAR>__{MR. WHITE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{--It is that too--}
<CHAR>__{NICE GUY EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{--It is that too.  But it's also he couldn't get a waiter job.  You talk like a pissed off dishwasher: "Fuck those cunts and their fucking tips."}

<CHAR>__{MR. BLONDE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country.  It's the one jab basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.}

<DIAL>__{Fuck all that.}
<ACTION>__{They all laugh.}
<CHAR>__{MR. WHITE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, I'm very sorry that the government taxes their tips. That's fucked up.  But that ain't my fault.  it would appear that waitresses are just one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis. You show me a paper says the government shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.  Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it.  But what I won't do is play ball.  And this non- college bullshit you're telling me, I got two words for that: "Learn to fuckin type."  Cause if you're expecting me to help out with the rent, you're in for a big fuckin surprise.}
