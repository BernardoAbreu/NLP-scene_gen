<A>__{chris and sam stand by the keg with fresh beers.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{so what's so wrong at home that you had to take off?}
<A>__{the question takes sam by surprise.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{i'd love to get outta here someday too... just don't know quite where i'd go.}
<A>__{sam decides to open up a little.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i hate it there. it's like everyone knows everything about me, but i'm invisible at the same time. it's like the worst of both worlds.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{small towns. how `bout your family?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{they didn't want me to leave... well, they did, but they wanted me to go away to harvard or something like that, like my sister.}
<A>__{sam takes a big sip of her beer, showing signs of tipsiness.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{sometimes i think it would've been easier if... i just, after my brother }
<A>__{sam stops herself.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(changing gears)}
<D>__{that's why i love corey, she just doesn't give a shit. she does what she wants and she doesn't care what people think.}

<C>__{chris}
<D>__{huh...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{but that's why we're going to vegas. there's lots of opportunities there.}
<A>__{chris glances over to the pool where corey is topless, splashing and goofing around with some boys.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(smirking)}
<D>__{yeah, good place for it. gettin' some practice on the way, too.}
<A>__{sam takes offense, getting drunk and sensitive.}
