<A>__{jake, neytiri and other flying hunters swoop low above a herd of sturmbeest a rapids of thundering muscle. dust rises from this living river like steam from a python's back. tracking with the herd. a hunter appears in fg, astride a direhorse at full gallop. the sight is breathtaking. he hurls a 3 meter spear and one of the sturmbeest crashes down, flipping twice from momentum. jake rolls in like a fighter jet, his banshee screaming. he draws and fires his bow. the arrow strikes true, in the plexus between the armored shoulders and the beast crashes to the ground. skids to a stop in a cloud of dust. neytiri swoops in next to jake, arms raised and grinning wolfishly. cu tsu'tey, banking around jake's kill. jake looks up, and tsu'tey salutes in grudging admiration.}
