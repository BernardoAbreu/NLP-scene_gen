<D>__{will you knock it off? (climbing to his feet) jesus. what do you think...?}
<A>__{thunk. a soldier standing next to bill drops, the back of his head sprayed over nearby soldiers.}
<B>__{silence.}
<A>__{everyone stares at the dead man. another shot rings out another soldier drops. the others flinch, scan the tree line ahead of them.}

<D>__{what?}

<D>__{what the fu...! why isn't anyone firing?}

<C>__{bill django }
<D>__{take her out!}
<A>__{the soldiers open fire a deafening roar. the woman keeps on running as the foliage above her head is shredded by bullets. no shot comes close. bill watches amazed.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{every single one of bill's men fired high. they instinctively hadn't wanted to shoot another person. later bill would come across a study by general s.l.a marshall, which revealed that only 15 20 percent of fresh soldiers shot to kill. the rest aimed high, didn't fire at all, or pretended to be busy doing something else.}
<A>__{bullets still flying above her head, the woman stops running, crouches down and returns fire. bill is shot, stumbles backwards and falls into the mud, his finger still stuck in his m 16. he lies there, staring up at the sky, his expression one of puzzlement, as a huge blood stain spreads over his chest. bill's p.o.v the edges of our vision darken down as the sound fades out. the darkness flows inwards, as if an iris is closing down until only a pin point of white light remains in the centre of the sky. we begin to move towards the light, slowly at first and then faster and faster. just as we are about to reach it, a vision of the face of the vc woman appears, filling the white disc.}
