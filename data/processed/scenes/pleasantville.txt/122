<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior lover's lane. night.}
<A>__{david and margaret sit on the edge of the grass, looking out across the water. even in the moonlight, the colors are vivid. david still clutches the gardenia in his hand, taking a long hit like an opium addict.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(inhaling)}
<D>__{mmmmgh.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{do they have those ... where you come from?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yeah ... i guess.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{you don't know?}
<A>__{margaret laughs like that isn't even possible. she shifts on the grass hiking her skirt up above the knee. it reveals a long tan leg beneath it. david watches as she kicks off her shoes, rubbing her feet through the long cool grass.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{so what's it like?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{out there.}
<A>__{she clings onto the words like they could transport her by themselves. david thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh. don't know ... it's different.}
<A>__{she leans forward.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well it's louder ... and scarier i guess ... and ... and a lot more dangerous ...}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{sounds fantastic. you know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming took off all their clothes.}
<A>__{she giggles. david looks at her in amazement.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{do they have an ocean? i've heard about the ocean.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{what's that like?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well it's big. and it's blue ...}
<P>__{(as if realizing it for the first time)}
<D>__{... it's really really blue.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{mmmm.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{boy. it's hot up here.}
<A>__{suddenly and without warning margaret unbuttons her cardigan sweater. she slips it off, arching her back like the figurehead of a ship and david just stares at her breasts. she wears a light cotton blouse and even in the moonlight it forms a translucent silhouette ... she lays the sweater across the grass and leans back on it.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{you want some berries?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hunh?}
<A>__{she unfolds a handkerchief revealing a handful of berries in}
<B>__{reds and blues and purples.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i picked them myself. they grow wild up here.}
<P>__{(eating one)}
<D>__{mmm. so sweet.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(looking at them)}
<D>__{they just grow like that?}
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(looking straight up)}
<D>__{oh yeah. there's a lot of stuff. currants and strawberries ... here. i will show you.}
<A>__{she hops up and scampers across the grassy bank, kicking her heels behind her. margaret reaches a tree in the distance and reaches toward an upper limb, stretching out her body like a piece of statuary. she picks a piece of fruit and scampers back toward him, hiking up her skirt as she goes ...}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{here.}
<B>__{closer.}
<A>__{margaret sticks out her hand, offering him a bright red apple. it's brilliant and shiny and glistens in the moonlight.}
<B>__{angle. david.}
<A>__{he hesitates just looking at it. margaret speaks in a whisper.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{go on. try it.}
<B>__{his pov.}
<A>__{she is lying on her stomach now, and behind the outstretched apple he can see an ample view of her cleavage. margaret is smiling at him as the apple shines in the foreground. david reaches out and takes it.}
<B>__{wider. david and margaret.}
<A>__{for this instant, they seem alone in the garden. he looks down at it, then glances over at margaret. david hesitates for a split second then takes a bite of the apple ...}
