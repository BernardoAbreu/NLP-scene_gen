<A>__{the story begins with an opening shot on the exterior of the executive mansion. it is a gala day. soldiers are lined up in front of the entrance; expensive cars and carriages are arriving and depositing distinguished notables from the adjoining countries. two trumpeters at the head of the stairs announce the arrival of each notable. in the large reception hall, mrs. teasdale, wife of the late president, is greeting the newcomers. the room is filled with distinguished guests. at the moment we see mrs. teasdale, she is talking with a notable. in the near background is a group of distinguished men, members of her own cabinet. her words to the notable are not lost on them, and as she begins to praise the new dictator, there is the exchange of disapproving glances.}
<C>__{mrs. teasdale}
<D>__{it is so good of you to come.}
<C>__{notable}
<D>__{an honor, mrs. teasdale... you must indeed have great faith in your new dictator to give him such a magnificent reception.}
<C>__{mrs. teasdale}
<D>__{i feel that rufus t. firefly is the only logical successor to my dear departed husband. he has the statesmanship of gladstone, the humility of lincoln, and the wisdom of pericles.}
<A>__{the notable kisses her hand once more and leaves the scene. as he does, the background group moves into mrs. teasdale. their spokesman addresses mrs. teasdale.}
<C>__{first cabinet member}
<P>__{(protestingly)}
<D>__{mrs. teasdale, as members of freedonia's cabinet, we do not approve of your choice. who is this rufus t. firefly?}
<C>__{second cabinet member}
<P>__{(waving aloft a paper)}
<D>__{a stranger in our midst, an agent for the eureka ammunition company. think of it, gentlemen, an ammunition salesman dictating the policies of our peace loving country.}
<C>__{third cabinet member}
<D>__{reconsider, mrs. teasdale, before it is too late. the citizens of freedonia want a president!}
<C>__{mrs. teasdale}
<D>__{as the widow of your last president, i have the right to choose and, gentlemen, i refuse to discuss the matter any further.}
<A>__{mrs teasdale turns her back on them, leaving them to mumble among themselves. from off scene comes a servant's voice, announcing:}
<C>__{servant}
<D>__{his excellency, ambassador verdi trentino of amnesia!}
<A>__{cut... to the archway. we see trentino enter with a beautiful brunette at his side. he is followed by two or three of his fellowmen. he moves across the reception hall to mrs. teasdale, bows most graciously and presses his lips to the back of her hand, then introduces his companion.}
<C>__{trentino}
<D>__{mrs. teasdale... my niece, vera.}
<A>__{mrs. teasdale shakes the girl's hand warmly.}
<C>__{mrs. teasdale}
<P>__{(to niece)}
<D>__{your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis. without his country's financial aid }
<C>__{trentino}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{what is money?}
<P>__{(tenderly)}
<D>__{mrs. teasdale, for you i would do anything.}
<C>__{mrs. teasdale}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{ambassador!}
<P>__{(attempting to change the subject)}
<D>__{i am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.}
<C>__{trentino}
<P>__{(persistent in his flattery)}
<D>__{mrs. teasdale no matter who rules freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.}
<A>__{trentino attempts to take her hand. the latter is a bit confused, much to the amusement of vera, who laughingly says:}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{mrs. teasdale, my uncle's hopeless you've been the only topic of conversation ever since we left amnesia.}
<A>__{mrs. teasdale's confusion is happily interrupted by the announcement of a servant, off scene.}
<C>__{servant}
<D>__{the honorable mohamed pandooh of mufhtan!}
<C>__{mrs. teasdale}
<P>__{(hastily)}
<D>__{oh, i must greet his honor.}
<A>__{mrs. teasdale exits from the scene quickly. vera and trentino look after her, then vera laughs softly, as their eyes meet.}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{so that's the one you want to marry.}
<C>__{trentino}
<D>__{with mrs. teasdale as my wife and freedonia under my control }
<P>__{(he rubs his hands significantly)}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{maybe it's not going to be so easy. from what i've heard, mrs. teasdale is rather sweet on this rufus t. firefly.}
<C>__{trentino}
<D>__{that's where you come in. i will leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.}
<A>__{vera winks agreeingly. mrs. teasdale enters the scene with bob firefly (zeppo). she introduces him.}
<C>__{mrs. teasdale}
<D>__{i want you to meet the son of his excellency bob firefly...}
<A>__{ambassador trentino... his niece, vera, after the formalities of introducing, trentino says:}
<C>__{trentino}

<P>__{(mockingly)}
<D>__{i do hope his excellency won't be late.}

<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{my father makes it a point to always be on time. as long as i've known him, he's never been late for an appointment.}

<P>__{(as music begins)}
<D>__{his excellency is due to take his station. beginning his new administration... he'll make his appearance when the clock on the wall strikes ten.}

<D>__{i hope nothing has happened.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{mrs. teasdale, i assure you there is nothing to worry about. father is probably taking extra care in getting into his robes of state. i will call him.}
<A>__{bob goes over to a corner of the room and pulls a tapestried bell cord. this rings a fire bell in groucho's room and groucho is disclosed asleep in his canopied bed under a mosquito netting. he has an unlighted cigar in his mouth. the continued jangling of the fire bell awakens him from his slumber and he rises quickly. the cigar begins to emit smoke when he starts puffing. he hurries over to one corner of the room where his clothes are arranged in fireman fashion, gets into them, and then sides down a fireman's pole into the reception hall. the guests are singing the last two lines of the national anthem when he arrives.}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{hail, hail, freedonia... land of the brave and free.}
<A>__{groucho starts across the hall in the direction of mrs. teasdale. he passes several notables, one of whom is wearing an impressive looking medal. groucho deprives him of it without stopping his forward movement, and pins it on himself. he pauses only when he is facing the principal group.}

<P>__{(beaming as she addresses groucho)}
<D>__{as chairwoman of the reception committee, i welcome you and extend the good wishes of every man, woman and child of freedonia. i deem it an honor on this momentous occasion...}

<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{you're not so bad yourself, mrs. teasdale, when i look at you i can see that we're facing a crisis. we've got to balance the budget we've got to cut down everything including, you.}

<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{that's even a greater honor.}
<C>__{trentino}
<D>__{i bring you the greetings of my president and the good will of my people.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{i will keep the greetings but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.}
<C>__{trentino}
<D>__{twenty million dollars is a considerable sum... i will have to discuss that with my minister of finance.}
