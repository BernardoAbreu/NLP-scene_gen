<L>__{exterior crash ship day}
<A>__{war pick in hand, paris eases to ground level. he checks the perimeter, looks inside the ship. nobody. is he being fucked with? again? he hopes?}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{audrey? oh, audrey....}
<C>__{audrey }
<D>__{what ?}
<A>__{paris spins. the voice came from the cargo hold and not where he expected.}
<L>__{interior cargo hold day}
<A>__{blades of sunlight stream in through cracks in the hull. paris enters to find shazza and audrey cutting open containers, searching for usable goods.}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{tell me that was you.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{okay, it was me. what'd i do now?}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.}
<C>__{shazza}
<D>__{what're you goin' on about? she's been right here for the last....}
<A>__{they all see it: sun blades are momentarily blocked by something passing outside. some one .}
<C>__{shazza}
<P>__{(a quiet probe)}
<D>__{zeke?}
<A>__{no answer. audrey springs to the other side of hold, puts an eye to a crack there. hull crack pov: far away, zeke finishes digging the grave. he starts toward the ship. audrey whirls back, mouths a silent alarm: "riddick!" paris goes bloodless. shazza grabs the war pick out of his frozen hands, moves catlike to the main doors and poises there, ready to strike. audrey follows with the hunting boomerang. all eyes watch as... the sun blades, winking off and on, chart riddick's approach: we feel like we're inside a magician's sword box, watching the blades shave closer and closer to us. suddenly he appears ... and shazza swings hard.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{facing them is a total stranger burned, half naked, one hand still clutching the emergency release lever of his cryo locker. shazza stopped one inch short of killing him.}
<C>__{total stranger}
<D>__{i thought...my god, i thought i was the only one who....}
<A>__{he lurches toward shazza, trying to embrace her and sees blood and brain bits blam blamming against her. his own . the stranger sinks bonelessly to the ground. fast rack to reveal zeke in the background, pistol leveled. he reads shazza's horrified face and understands what he's done.}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{oh, lord....}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{it was just somebody else. from the crash. he was just....}
<C>__{zeke}
<D>__{cripes galore, i thought it was him. the murderin' ratbag. i thought he was....}
<A>__{he rushes over to check the dead stranger. as he bends down, fast rack again to reveal riddick in the background . he stands}
