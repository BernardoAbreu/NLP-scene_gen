<A>__{as cameron falls into the shot, landing on a hidden trampoline near the stone wall, bouncing up and down 'til he finally comes to rest.}
<C>__{offstage voice}
<D>__{cut!!}
<L>__{137 angle to include eli and crew}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{who said that?}
<A>__{cameron stares over the edge of the trampoline as henry, the assistant cameraman, uneasily faces eli.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{we had a film run out.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(to gabe)}
<D>__{how many feet are left in that camera?}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(checking the mitchell)}
<D>__{thirty six feet.}
<A>__{eli advances murderously on the assistant cameraman, building to a rage we have not seen in him before.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{goddamn you! how many times are you going to do this to me? how dare you yell cut on my set?}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{thirty six feet is nothing...}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's twenty two seconds! in twenty two seconds, i could break your spine...i could pinch your fucking head off like an insect and smear it on the pavement...i could put twenty two bullets in that fat gut of yours! the only thing i can't seem to do in twenty two seconds is keep you from fucking up my film!}
<A>__{cameron is so intrigued that he hasn't realized an ember is burning through his asbestos protector, until suddenly he feels the flame and frantically begins beating it out and thus, is even denied the pleasure of savoring eli's anguish.}
