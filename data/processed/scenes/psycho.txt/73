<A>__{norman is coming at camera, running head on. he dashes into an extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in his face. camera pans as norman races past, holds as norman runs to the porch and quickly along it and directly to mary's room.}

<A>__{norman pauses a moment in the doorway, glances about the room, hears the shower going, sees the bathroom door is open. he goes to the bathroom, looks in, sees the body. slowly, almost carefully, he raises his hands to his face, covers his eyes, turns his face away. then he crosses to the window, looks out at the house. shot is so angled that we see the bedside table with the newspaper on it. after a moment, norman moves from the window, sinks onto the edge of the bed. fresh angle behind norman norman sitting on bed, the bathroom in b.g. of shot. we can see only the hand of the dead girl, lying along the tile floor. norman presses his eyes, fights to find a way out of his dilemma. slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the peace that comes with decision. norman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with resolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across it. then he crosses to the front window, facing the porch, and draws those curtains closed. then he switches off the bedroom light, leaving the room lit only by the spill from the bathroom. he opens the front door, goes out.}
