<A>__{racine gets rid of his briefcase and jacket as grace comes in from the porch.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{hi, guys. just come on in, make yourself at home.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{sorry about that.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{not me. the door was unlocked, inviting illegal entry. it's behavior like that makes oscar's job so hard.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{sorry, oscar. would you guys a beer?}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{no thanks, i already had one.}
<A>__{oscar indicates "no" as racine takes one from the refrigerator for himself and begins unbuttoning his shirt.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i've gotta bring my wife up here. she thinks our house is the hottest place in the county.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{it ain't great this time of day.}
<A>__{there is a pregnant pause as racine takes off his shirt and leans against the refrigerator.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{ned, how did you get involved with this matty walker?}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(takes a drink)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i mean she's poison, man. tell me what you know about her old man's death.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{what read in the paper. he died in the fire. looks like arson converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{was arson.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{okay, was arson. you don't know if he was setting it and messed up... or if that's just what someone wanted it to look like.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{nah, he didn't set it. somebody offend him.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{his people owned the place or something?}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{that's right. a very rough group of fellows, too. they're arguing with the insurance company right now. it's possible they wanted to cut old edmund out. i'm sure they're not too broken up over his departure.}
<P>__{(grimaces)}
<D>__{but this just doesn't seem like a neat way to handle something like that.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{it's not their style. they're very smooth. they'd rather destroy you than kill you. and they hate publicity.}
<A>__{racine takes it in, sucks on his beer.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{course guys like that make a lot of enemies. coulda been a grudge match from the outside, i suppose.}
<P>__{(he looks at racine)}
<D>__{but me, i'm kinda interested in the grieving widow.}
<A>__{racine looks a little skeptical. he thinks about it as he moves to a chair.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{her sister in law's got plenty of ideas along that line, too. she could barely contain herself today, i could tell.}
<P>__{(he cackles)}
<D>__{but she wants to wait and see how matty treats her on the estate. she doesn't want to blow it. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{how'd you get involved?}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{they asked me to re do the will. i met with her and edmund. it was pretty simple. this mary ann simpson witnessed it with me. walker didn't seem to think it was any big deal.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that's it.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what was this simpson's story?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i don't know... old friend of theirs, good looking broad. she was just passing through.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{on her way to europe?}
<A>__{racine shrugs, he doesn't know.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{the passport people can't find any record of that.}
<A>__{lowenstein and grace look at him a long time.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what do you think? about the wife?}
<A>__{racine considers a moment.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i suppose it's possible. i don't know much about her, except }
<P>__{(he grins)}
<D>__{ what i've seen. wouldn't shock me, either way.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{i've got a feeling she's very bad news. take some incredibly intelligent advice and stay away from her.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{he's right for once.}
<A>__{they both get up to leave. racine watches from the chair.}
<D>__{converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{well, i'm sorry, guys. i'm afraid i can't do that.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{first of all, did you get a look at her?}
<A>__{they did. racine grins. he stands up and comes right up to them.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that wouldn't be quite so meaningful, except that today she started coming on to me. and maybe you haven't heard but the lady is about to come into a great deal of money.}
<A>__{they look at him with some concern.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{the fact is, she's invited me out to her place tonight. and i'm going. and i will keep on going as many nights, or days, or weekends, as she'll have me.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{ned, that lady may have just killed her husband.}
<A>__{racine smiles cheerfully and puts a reassuring arm around lowenstein's shoulder, leading him to the door.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{peter, she's not gonna inherit anything by killing me.}
<A>__{lowenstein is out the door now. he looks at racine in wonder. he shakes his head and goes down the steps. racine turns, smiling, to grace, but oscar is grim.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{ned, you've messed up before. you'll mess up again. that's your nature. but they've always been small time. this might not be. she's trouble, ned. the real thing. big time, major league trouble. watch yourself.}
<A>__{racine reassures his friend with touch and oscar leaves.}
