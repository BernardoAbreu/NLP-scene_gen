<A>__{gale's eyes move down the end of the gun to find...}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{standing, lips pursed.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{hello, gale, we've been waiting for you.}
<A>__{gale's face is a mass of confusion.}

<A>__{derek releases sidney, shoving her, she falls to her knees, next to cotton. close on cotton's hand}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{okay, look, you guys i applaud your methodical expertise but i have a question. what's going to happen after i die? i thought the heroine is supposed to live.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{not this time.}
<A>__{hallie moves in on her.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{yeah, we're trying to send a message to hollywood. i'm really getting tired of all the happy endings. it's just not reality. in the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{but nobody wants to see that. it'll never go. they'll rewrite you. you don't want that.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{oh, sid, you're sounding desparate. i guess fearing death makes one anxious.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you fucking freaked out movie nut psychos...}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(off camera)}
<D>__{don't blame the movies, sid. movies don't create pyschos.}
<A>__{sid stops dead in her tracks as these words still her very soul. the voice comes from the wings. they all turn as gale weathers appears. behind her, with gun in hand, is debbie salt. derek grabs the camera. he doesn't want to miss a second.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{don't you know that by now? it's about family. it all starts at home. it starts with the father... and the mother.}
<A>__{sidney mouth drops, her face aghast, as she looks to debbie salt. she recognizes her immediately.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{mrs. loomis?}
<A>__{gale stops cold.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{gale turns to debbie salt.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{jesus. it can't be.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{told you we had a guest star. didn't see that coming, did you?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{everything's taken on a hyper reality, hasn't it?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{you're billy's mother?}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{i couldn't believe you didn't recognize me. you even interviewed me for your book.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{you're all in this together?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{we had to have financing.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{tuition's expensive.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{why mrs. loomis?}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{where should we start? your mother ruined my marriage by sleeping with my husband. you ruined my family by killing my son. gale aired it to the world. should i go on... isn't that enough?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{jesus, you're just as whacked as your son.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{where do you think he got it? mental illness is heriditary. who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? he was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.}
<A>__{sidney is completely horror stricken. she stands in total disbelief.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{yeah, she's been great, sid. we never would have been able to it without her.}
<A>__{debbie salt mrs. loomis looks to both derek and hallie, smiling.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{and i couldn't have done it without you two. now who won the coin toss?}
<A>__{hallie raises her hand.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{i did.}
<A>__{debbie points the gun at her, quickly, simply... and fires. sid and gale scream as a bullet through the forehead sends hallie flying back against the flat wall. her body drops to the floor. dead. derek drops the camera, completely taken back. he looks to debbie.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{what are you...}
<A>__{debbie turns the gun on him. fires again. derek moves, the bullet catches him in the stomach. he drops to his knees. debbie fires again. derek takes another bullet. this time dropping. very dead. his body falls near cotton who has remained suspiciously quiet through this ordeal. he eyes derek's knife that now lay near his wrists.}
<B>__{sidney and gale}
<A>__{turn to debbie in complete horror.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{nice kids but a little out there.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{what are you going to do?}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{finish what my son started.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{but you'll never get away with it.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{enter cotton weary.}
<A>__{cotton looks up.}
<C>__{debbie salt }
<D>__{think about it. an innocent man wrongly accused. spends time in prison where he justs sits with his righteous anger, waiting, planning his revenge. his life so incomprehensively ruined he's forced to take revenge on the people responsible. it's perfect.}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{no... not again.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{sorry, cotton. i guess you were just meant to be a killer.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you'll never get away with this.}
<A>__{debbie moves to cotton, shrugging.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{who would you like to shoot first, cotton?}
<A>__{just then, cotton leans up, freed from his bindings. with the knife in hand, he lunges for debbie salt. it strikes her, lodging into her chest. she goes back. cotton doesn't stop, he stabs her again and again. she goes down. dead.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{thank god.}
<A>__{gale rushes to cotton as he jumps to his feet. she helps him with the last of his bindings. sid looks about at the body count on stage. it's mounting. she takes a deep breath. relieved.}
<C>__{gale }
<D>__{god, cotton, what a nightmare. i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{gale gives him a hug. close on cotton's face}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he hugs her back. she doesn't see as he rises the knife behind her, bringing it down in one swift, maniacal move. gale's body jerks, a moment of shock and then she goes limp as the knife lodges in her back. sidney turns just in time to see cotton toss gale's body down into the orchestra pit. he turns, facing sidney. the bloody knife in hand.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{nooo!}
<A>__{cotton moves to derek's body where the video camera lay, he pulls the tape from it.}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{it's perfect, sidney. no one will ever suspect me. i have proof. i'm the victim.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{please, cotton, don't do this.}
<A>__{he holds up the video cassette. murder in his eye.}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{i get my revenge and make some fast cash.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{it's over, cotton.}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{not until you're dead.}
<A>__{cotton lunges for her. sid tears off, slipping through the set door to...}
<B>__{backstage}
<A>__{sid runs to the rear of the stage. she moves in the narrow space that exists between the scrim and the back wail. she races down it. she almost reaches the end when cotton rips through the scrim! sidney ducks, bypassing him. she comes to the stage door. it's locked. she turns, seeing the metal ladder that's attached to the wall. it leads to the catwalk above. sid goes for it. she climbs up the ladder with lightning speed. cotton, up and running, is close behind.}
