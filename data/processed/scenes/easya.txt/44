<D>__{i'm sure you all remember the party...}
<L>__{interior bostic house night}
<A>__{a teen party rages. drunk kids abound. olive, looking like a million fuckin' bucks, prances into the party with brandon, who's looking pretty snazzy himself. they appear drunk and are falling all over each other. people stare in complete amazement at a.) their appearance and b.) that they're even together in the first place. you'd never guess that this was anything less than an a list teen couple, ripped from the pages of teen people. olive falls against brandon laughing. he hoists her up, as their host, melanie bostic (17), a fairly pretty girl, approaches.}
