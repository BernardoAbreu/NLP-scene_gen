<A>__{jack comes off the autostrada on a slip road and pulls into a forecourt consisting of several rows of agip and q8 pumps, a convenience shop, a repair garage and a cafe. the car park is not large. jack parks the citroen facing the exit. there is a single bar across it but this is raised. jack double checks the magazine in his handgun is full and slips his walther into his jacket pocket. stepping out of the car he looks around the car park. it's only a quarter full and ominously quiet. somewhere in the distance we can hear a sound: creak, creak, creak, creak... jack takes the briefcase from the rear seat and walks away. he makes a show of locking the car but doesn't. as he approaches the cafe he passes the garage. we see the source of the creak, creak, creaking sound: a sign for engine oil, on hinges, revolving slowly in the breeze.}
