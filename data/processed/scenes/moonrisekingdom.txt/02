<L>__{exterior bishop's house. day}
<A>__{a rickety, three story, stone and shingle house on a hillside with turrets and a widow's walk. a weather vane swings creaking on the roof. tree tops sway in a cluster below. the sea is almost invisible in the misting rain, and the mainland is a shadow across the sound. suzy sits in the high window, watching.}
<T>__{titles over:}
<A>__{the family stuck indoors all day out of the rain. in bedrooms, bathrooms, and corridors, we see the boys. they shoot marbles. they throw jacks. they play cards. they eat grilled cheese sandwiches together in the kitchen. in half open doorways, we see the parents. mr. bishop is a tall, fifty year old man in madras trousers and horn rimmed glasses. he reads the newspaper and drinks coffee. mrs. bishop is a tan, forty five year old woman in a lilly pulitzer type wrap around skirt. she washes her hair, topless, in the kitchen sink. in windows, we see suzy with her binoculars. she watches wet branches shaking in the woods. she watches a man in a slicker fishing from a row boat. she watches a white colt in a field. she eats a bowl of tomato soup alone in the pantry. in the distance, a seaplane flies by below the clouds.}
