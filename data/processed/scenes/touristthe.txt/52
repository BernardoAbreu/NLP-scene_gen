<A>__{frank puts one bare foot on the stonework. he grimaces as he heaves himself onto the railing of the balcony adjacent to his. he hangs desperately, flailing, 100 feet over the street below. he gets a tentative hold... a pallid french woman drops her coffee and screams. the russians sprint out to the balcony. they spot frank... who shoves the pallid woman inside, struggles past her breakfast table, and prepares to leap again but slips on the spilled coffee. bullets shatter china around him. he cuts his foot on a broken plate. he grabs his bleeding foot.}

<D>__{goddamn it! i'm a fucking tourist!}
<A>__{another round of shots ring out. they don't seem to care. frank goes over the railing with another awkward heave. his pursuers scale the adjoining stone work and step onto the pallid woman's balcony. this time frank lands in the lap of a burly welshman.}
