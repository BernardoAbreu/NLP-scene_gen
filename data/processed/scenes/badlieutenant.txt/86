(the scene mirrors scene 2. in which lt drove his own twins to school.) the final game (seven) is on the radio. lt is listening, but also not listening. lt talks wildly about jesus christ. and about the misery they pass in the street. he waves his gun wildly, punctuating his speech with potentially lethal gestures. he aims the gun at julio and paulo, then at himself, then out the window, then at the kids, again.}
