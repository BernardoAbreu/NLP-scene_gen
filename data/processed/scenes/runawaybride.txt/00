<A>__{the wind rustles the endless field of corn, blows over the freshly mown meadow of soybeans, and magically sways a copse of trees. it's a fall after noon. a sudden pounding of galloping hooves breaks the peace and... a horse and rider burst between the rows of corn into the meadow. they are running for their lives.}
<T>__{close on:}
<A>__{the rider is a bride a beautiful woman dressed in a disheveled wedding gown, it's train tattered and flying like a knight's banner out behind her. this is maggie carpenter. the horse is frothing and wild eyed, like the bride, who turns to look behind her in terror. the horse's labored breathing mingles with maggie's panicked gasps. we see a wedding bouquet fly into a ditch as the horse thunders on. maggie clings to the reins. she looks as though she is running from the devil himself.}
