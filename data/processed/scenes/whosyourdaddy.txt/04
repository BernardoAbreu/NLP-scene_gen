<L>__{interior tecumseh high school corridor day}
<A>__{christy malone, 17, fills her cheerleader uniform in all the right places. we watch her at her locker. also in slow mo. which makes even her most mundane task seem graceful. wow, just look at her stack those books.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{that's christy malone. head cheerleader, love of my life, lust of my loins.}
<A>__{christy glances off screen and squeals excitedly. another cheerleader enters the frame, holding a newspaper called "exposed!" christy reads the headline.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{"health teacher flunks her own lesson!" no way! it's miss pratt, smoking a doobie!}
<A>__{christy calls to ted....}
<C>__{christy }
<D>__{look at this, ted! imagine if we did this in the school paper!}
<A>__{she shows him "exposed!" ted gawks. happy just to be this close to christy. but they are quickly interrupted by...}
<C>__{principal merkin }
<D>__{hand them over! immediately!}
<A>__{principal richard merkin, mid 50's, marches down the hallway, seizing copies of "exposed!" from students' hands. we can see that it is a "homemade" looking newspaper. and there's obviously much ado about it. christy winks at ted as she hides the newspaper in her locker. freeze frame on christy, winking.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{look at that smile. that wink. that's no platonic wink. that's a wink that says, "i don't just want you, ted. i need you." so of course i had to ask her to the prom. i mean, she was practically begging for it.}
