<L>__{interior victor's office night}
<A>__{victor watches a bank of videoscreens. he has the baxter building under surveillance. he sees reed and sue on monitors. he toys with sue's diamond ring in his gloved hand. a door opens. leonard enters. he sees the screens.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{is reed any closer to a cure?}
<A>__{victor looks at that image of reed and sue on the screen.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{the only thing he's closer to is sue...}
<A>__{but victor sees something between reed and sue on the wall. he leans closer, and the camera zooms in, as if responding to his will. he zooms all the way to a close up of: reed's blueprints for the transformation chamber. victor's eyes narrow, mind ticking, a plan forming.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{make me a reservation for two at cipriani tonight.}
<A>__{victor opens a drawer, pulls out an old videotape.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{and get this over to ben grimm.}
<A>__{victor leans forward, fixated on that machine. as he gets closer, his screens go staticky. he absentmindedly picks at his scar. in shadows, we see skin peeling off.}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{close your eyes, baby. keep 'em closed.}
