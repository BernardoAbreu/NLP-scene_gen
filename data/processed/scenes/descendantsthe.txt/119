<L>__{exterior king family shared property house later}
<A>__{it's the same angle but now with forty king cousins gathered for the poll. we recognize some faces. closer amid drinks held aloft, a calabash is passed among the cousins into which the each places a folded ballot. matt sits watching the proceedings with cousin hugh, cousin six and another elderly cousin at a table piled with papers and contracts.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{elizabeth's not doing well.}
<C>__{cousin hugh}
<D>__{she'll be okay. she's a fighter.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no. she's dying. we took her off the machines.}
<A>__{later matt, hugh and six finish the count while others mill about, mingle, drink an early celebration for all except for a group of dissenters off to one side.}
<C>__{cousin hugh}
<D>__{well, no surprise. other than the holdouts who don't want to sell at all, it's don holitzer. chicago group a distant second. feels good. we're doing the right thing, mattie. at least there ain't going to be any wal mart. now it's your call, and we're all behind you, most of us anyway.}
<P>__{(handing him a pen)}
<D>__{go ahead, captain. make it official.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it's strange, that's all.}
<C>__{cousin hugh}
<D>__{what's strange?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we didn't do anything to own that land. it was entrusted to us. and now we're just...}
<A>__{hugh and six exchange a concerned look. for a moment we go very close on matt's eyes. then }
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{i can't do it. i won't do it. i'm not going to sign.}
<C>__{cousin hugh}
<D>__{what're you doing, matt? i mean, we know you have a lot on your plate right now, but you're not going to fuck this up for us. it's over. if we don't sell now, it'll be a mess when the trust dissolves. just sign, go to your wife, done.}
<C>__{cousin six}
<D>__{it's inevitable, matt. you know that. we'll get out of debt the taxes and maintenance have been leaching us for far too long.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i don't want it to go to holitzer. i don't want it to go to anyone. i want to keep it.}
<C>__{cousin six}
<D>__{for christ's sake. we can't move without your approval. and we don't want to.}
<A>__{hugh tries forcing matt's hand. matt resists.}
<C>__{cousin hugh}
<D>__{your head's not right, mattie. your head's not right. you want a couple days to think it over? take a couple days.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i don't need a couple days. i have the authority, and this is what i want. i haven't wanted something in a long time. we have other businesses we're converting to corporations. we can figure it out.}
<C>__{cousin six}
<D>__{but it's utterly unproductive land. it doesn't generate enough income to pay the goddamn taxes.}
<C>__{cousin hugh}
<D>__{you're the trustee. you know better than anyone we only have seven years left.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{then i have seven years to figure out how to keep it.}
<A>__{cousin hugh draws a long breath, looks up at the sky, then back at matt.}
<C>__{cousin hugh}
<D>__{we'll come after you. just because you're a lawyer doesn't mean the rest of us would be afraid to come after you. but nobody wants to do that. we're family.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{people will be relieved, hugh, the whole state. i sign that document, it's over. end of the line. something that was ours to protect will be gone. even though we're haole as shit and go to private schools and clubs and can't even speak pidgin, let alone hawaiian, we still carry hawaiian blood, and we're still tied to this land. and our children are tied to this land. it's a miracle that for whatever bullshit reason 150 years ago, we own this much of... paradise, but we do. and for whatever bullshit reason now, i'm the trustee. and i'm not signing. and if you sue me, it'll only make us closer.}
<A>__{cousin hugh releases a long breath more like a belch, quickly picks his nose, exchanges a look with cousin six. then he brings his fingers to his mouth to whistle.}
<C>__{cousin hugh}
<D>__{all right, everybody, listen up. cousin mattie has an announcement. get ready.}
<A>__{rising to his feet, matt scans the faces of his relatives.}
