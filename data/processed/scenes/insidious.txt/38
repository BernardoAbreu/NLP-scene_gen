<L>__{interior dalton's bedroom, lambert home day}
<A>__{a ghastly meld of hospital room and young boys bedroom. dalton lies on his bed, a heart rate monitor hooked to his chest. iv tubes run into his arms, a nasogastric feeding tube into his mouth. a young nurse, adele chalfin (30), checks the various tubes as renai watches on.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{are you having any more trouble with the feeding tube?}
<A>__{renai looks broken, the life drained from her. a wilted flower. she shakes her head, her voice a low rasp.}
<C>__{renai}
<P>__{(barely audible)}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{alright, well i will be back soon. i will bring some new books. you're probably sick of the ones you have.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{did he respond to any of the tests?}
<A>__{adele pauses.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{no...no, he didn't. but we have to give it time. i've seen coma patients with a much longer inactivity time suddenly start making noises.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{he's not in a coma, remember? they don't know what to call it. they don't know what to do with him so they've given up.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{no, they haven't. we're going to figure it out.}
<A>__{adele hugs her, then exits. renai slumps down on a chair next to her son. the heart rate monitor pings. dalton is as still as a statue.}
