<A>__{evelyn and danny sit on the bench, with a sweeping view of the harbor and the lights winking on all around it as the sun settles beyond the horizon. evelyn is stoic, numb; danny is the one who is struggling.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{before rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{he told me about you. that he had no other friend like you.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes. real straight, frugal. my father was the town drunk. went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the dawn express came along. rafe and i were the only ones at the funeral. he took me back to his house, and i never left.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you were more like brothers.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i taught him to drink beer. he taught me how to fly.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{he said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{...he said that?}
<A>__{evelyn nods, still staring away from danny. this pierces danny; he looks away, struggling not to let the emotions pull him completely under.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{look, uh...rafe's dad...he wrote me with the news, and it took me a couple of days to work up the guts to come here and tell you. i'm not as brave as rafe, or as noble. but if there's anything i can ever do to help you let me know, okay?}
<A>__{she stares into the distance. he stands and puts his hand on top of hers, as much for his comfort as for hers.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i understand why rafe loved you. you're as strong as he was.}
<A>__{since she's still not looking at him, he starts to move away. when he reaches the turn in the path, he looks back, and sees her figure in the gathering darkness. she's begun to break down; and as he watches, her whole body starts convulsing, and she doubles up in shattering grief. danny can't just stand there; he moves back to her, and puts a hand on her shoulder. he sits beside her again, and suddenly she turns to him and sobs upon him. danny wraps her gently in his arms, and then he breaks down, having found the first place he can truly grieve.}
