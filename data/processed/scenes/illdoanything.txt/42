<L>__{interior house day}
<A>__{they enter. a bedroom down a narrow hallway from where they stand. remember "the best years of our lives"... frederic march coming home from the wars and seeing his wife just a beat before she sees him. here we have a wretched mutant of that moment. beth, still fierce and attractive, is packing her daughter's suitcase when she senses him and looks up. shaking her head with a disapproval which will never die, she walks to him.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{hello did you two meet?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{not really. is she ready? i have the taxi waiting.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i just have to say goodbye. you have no idea how difficult that is.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it's three weeks.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it's not three weeks.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yes, it is.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no, it's not.}
<A>__{several beats beth and the man staring at matt.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it is.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{he doesn't know?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you are not taking her for a visit. you are taking her for a while.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{just because you want to go off with him doesn't mean i...}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you're getting the wrong idea.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i don't think so. no matter how you put this...}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hey, look, i'm a united states marshal. i'm here because she didn't show up yesterday to start serving her time.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i don't have a choice. you don't have a choice.}
<A>__{she turns and starts for the other room.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what did she do?}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{i loved, helped and supported in every possible way a business man who committed the terrible crime of being financially imaginative with a pension fund.}
<A>__{she exits. he sits down, stunned in the headlights of his fate.}
