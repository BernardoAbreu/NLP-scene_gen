<A>__{gin in a clearing, arms at her sides, a determined look. mac is somewhere just behind us.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{this time, when you raise your arm. don't breathe.}
<A>__{she nods, got it. focused. suddenly, in the clearing before her, a hostage silhouette target pops up, the outline of a terrorist shielding himself with a hostage, gin's arm rising with a blur and... ...blamm, blamm, blamm!!! the paper terrorist is nailed in the head. two out of three. she lets out a thin stream of air. proud of herself, but too cool to gloat.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{very, very nice. had a tour with the mosad, did you?}
<A>__{she turns slowly.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{where does this fit in the game plan?}
<A>__{his enigmatic, yet fond, smile.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{oh, it doesn't. but one never knows...}
<A>__{a quiet wink.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you might need it with me.}
