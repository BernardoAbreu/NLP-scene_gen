<A>__{clyde, still holding the figurine under the whirring fan, leans to one side in his chair, glancing out the window. he glimpses scurrying figures behind cars, cops darting and surrounding the house, motioning with hand signals... he holds up the figurine for a final look. satisfied with it, he places it onto: a chessboard the last piece. all the others are also hand painted, gorgeous. real craftsmanship here. he stands. calmly moves to the middle of the room. kicks off his shoes. peels off his shirt and undershirt. even takes off his pants. there will be no confusion about hidden weapons. he positions himself, very precise and purposeful. lifts his hands high above his head. presenting himself. waiting. then, bam: doors explode in and windows shatter as the swat tactical troops storm the room, bad asses in black, machine guns aimed, encircling him, everybody shouting:}

<A>__{clyde is the calm eye of a pissed off storm of highly professional cops with itchy trigger fingers. he remains serene, looking around at them, hands raised high...}
<C>__{swat captain}
<D>__{on the floor! face down! do it now!}
<A>__{he compliantly goes to his knees, then prone, offers his hands behind his back. they move in, cuff him, as troops spread throughout the house yelling "clear!"}
