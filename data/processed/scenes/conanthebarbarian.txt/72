<D>__{we go to khor kalba?}

<C>__{conan}
<D>__{just leave me to sleep.}
<A>__{but tamara doesn't leave, forcing conan to respond.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{you would risk your life for royalty? why?}
<A>__{tamara pauses, realizing she must trust conan to gain his help.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{because she represent freedom, not just ours but all hyboria's. what do you know of acheron?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{a tall tale. meant to scare children.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{it is no fable. it's my people's history. acheron was an empire that swallowed all of hyboria, led by the king and his legion of demon warriors. unstoppable. insatiable. immortal. but still it had one weakness. for the true power of acheron laid not with its king, but the queen. every twenty years, a new queen from the royal line would be coronated with a crown of iron. spikes would pierce her, slowly drain her precious blood, and through her suffering acheron would remain invincible. until one of my ancestors, an acheronian himself, put a stop to this tyranny. he and others spirited the new queen away, hiding her from the empire and all those who would raise it again.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{what care i for queens and empires?}
<A>__{conan turns to head back to his bed. tamara grabs him, incensed.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{didn't you hear me? this evil faces us all. all of civilization will fall if the army of acheron is raised again.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i heard. only i would happily put all of your "civilization" to the torch myself.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{but you owe me a debt, you thankless oaf!}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{my only debt is to my people. and it still lies unpaid.}
