<L>__{interior kaffee's apartment later afternoon}
<A>__{a nerf ball bounces off the wall. kaffee, jo and sam are sprawled out in the living room. for hours now they've been trying to come up with an idea. kaffee's mind seems to be on his basketball game.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i say we hit him with the phoney transfer order.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's the transfer order without a witness?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{we have a witness.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{a dead witness.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{and in the hands of a lesser attorney, that'd be a problem.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{look at this. last night he was swimming in his jack daniels, now he can leap tall buildings in a single bound.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i'm getting my second wind. siddown. both of you.}
<A>__{he sees that sam and jo were already sitting down.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{good.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{jessep told kendrick to order a code red. kendrick did, and our clients followed the order. the cover up isn't our case. to win, jessep has to tell the jury that he ordered the code red.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and you think you can got him to just say it?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i think he wants to say it. i think he's pissed off that he's gotta hide from us. i think he wants to say that he made a command decision and that's the end of it. he eats breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 cubans who are trained to kill him, and no one's gonna tell him how to run his base. least of all the pushy broad, the smart jew, and the harvard clown. i need to shake him and put him on the defensive.}
<A>__{sam and jo are silent for a moment.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's it? that's the plan?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{that's the plan.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you're gonna trip jessep and he's gonna confess.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i'm not gonna trip him. i'm gonna lead him right where he's dying to go.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and how are you gonna do that?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i have no idea. i need my bat.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{i need my bat. i think better with my bat. where's my bat?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i put it in the closet.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{you put it in the closet.}
<A>__{kaffee heads to the closet.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i was tripping over it.}
<C>__{kaffee }
<D>__{don't ever put a bat in a closet.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{he thinks better with his bat?}
<A>__{and we go to kaffee at the closet.}
<B>__{offscreen we hear}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i can understand that. i used to have stuffed panda named mr. boob. i could never do my home work without him.}
<A>__{during this, kaffee's opened the closet door. he reaches in to grab his bat when all of a sudden he notices something: his clothes. his uniforms and his civilian clothes. hanging neatly along the bar. he stares at this a moment, then suddenly heads back through the living room towards the front door.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{stay here, i'm going to the office for a while.}
<A>__{kaffee storms out.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{boy, he does think better with that bat.}
