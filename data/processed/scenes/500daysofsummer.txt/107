<L>__{int restaurant later}
<A>__{tom and alison eat. in silence.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{so...uh... how's it going?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{you've been pretty quiet.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i'm pretty quiet too. usually. it's nice sometimes to be comfortable enough that you can just sit and eat and not have to say anything, you know?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{more silence.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{do you want to try some }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{alison looks at her food. tom realizes he's been difficult, starts to feel kinda bad.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's just... there's this girl.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i'm not usually like this. i wasn't before... long story short, she wrecked me. i don't know if you can tell but it was pretty recent and i'm still kinda thinking about her.}
<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{well maybe you should think about... someone else... who could cheer you up.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i can't get her out of my head, you know? i see her everywhere. she's all i think about. and it's horrible. cause i totally didn't see it coming. i thought things were fine. so now i keep going through every day in my mind, every second really. wondering. what went wrong? is it my fault? could i have prevented it somehow?}
