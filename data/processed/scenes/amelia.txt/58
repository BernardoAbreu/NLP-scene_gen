<L>__{exterior vega later}
<A>__{a terrifying storm batters the plane, which bobs and darts and dips like a leaf in a gale.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{...was that my altimeter would conk out. never to return.}
<L>__{interior vega same moment}
<A>__{amelia fights for control as the plane is tossed and shaken.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{the only way to have any sense of altitude, was to keep dropping toward the sea.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{when the engines sputtered, that was my low level limit.}
<A>__{a sudden jolt knocks her out of her seat. she scrambles back, as we see whitecaps a few feet below. she jerks the nose up, the engine coughs... ...and climbs.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) i was too busy to grasp how impossible the situation had become. the joke was...}
<A>__{later. flying in and out of cloud cover.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) all those months flying only with instruments, i should have been practicing without them.}
<A>__{pan to the windshield. a small glow at the surface of a vibrating engine. amelia hasn't noticed.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) i started to wonder if luck was paying me back. for thinking i knew the rules.}
<A>__{a small blue flame licks out into the night.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) then i smelled burning oil.}
<A>__{she sees it now. the flame coming through a broken weld in the manifold ring.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) a bad weld, already a small flame. it would be hours back to canada, trying to find an unlit field, landing with a heavy fuel load.}
<A>__{she stares at the little flame. is it growing bigger?}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) i told myself, push on. after all, if it was a stupid choice...}
<A>__{later. flying in blackness. rising, as the engines seem sluggish.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) ...no one would ever know.}
<A>__{suddenly, a film of slush on the windscreen.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) with seemingly no warning, there was ice. the controls froze.}
<A>__{and the vega dives into a dizzying spin.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) through the spin i had one thought, it would be warmer lower, the ice would melt, i just had to regain control...}
