<A>__{to sam's pov of the office. it is about four feet wide. a small blacked out window high on the far wall is bisected by what looks like a recently constructed side wall. the room is bare except for a chair and a desk which is also bisected by the new wall. pneumatic tubes hang from the ceiling. sam slowly enters the room.}
<L>__{interior sam's office day}
<A>__{sam looks lost ... disoriented. he doesn't know where to begin because there's nothing to begin with. he squeezes in behind his desk and for want of anything else to do starts arranging his "in" and "out" baskets. there in his "in" basket is one of the ubiquitous executive toys gaily wrapped with a card from helpmann merry xmas & welcome. sam can't quite believe. he returns to lining up his pencils, placing a couple of bocks (phone books) against the wall on the left extreme of his desk. sam turns his attention away from the books when suddenly they both fall over with a "plop". puzzled, he stands the books up again, turns his eyes away and "plop". same result. intrigued, a bit exasperated, sam carefully, and before his very eyes, the desk begins to disappear into the wall, and "plop", the books topple over. puzzled, sam grabs hold of the desk and begins to try to pull it back through the wall. the desk moves back an inch or so, but then stops, somehow held stubbornly. sam grits his teeth, reallllly pulls, grimacing a bit, but the desk won't budge. intrigued, sam gets up, goes around his desk and heads for the door.}
