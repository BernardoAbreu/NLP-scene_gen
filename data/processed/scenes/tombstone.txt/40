<D>__{i want to remember exactly how i looked on this day so i want you to take a picture of me...}
<A>__{she steps out wearing a diaphonous veil shrouding her from head to toe. though it partially obscures her form, we can see that she's completely nude underneath. fly gasps.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{...all of me.}
<A>__{fly fumbles with his camera, his composure gone. she turns to a nearby mirror, studying herself black tresses, rounded lips, maddening curves, and smokey eyes a dark angel. she smiles:}
