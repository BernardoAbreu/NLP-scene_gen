<A>__{figure 1 exchanges a meaningful look with figure 2. figure 1 throws two solid gold pieces at the feet of the sherpa. on them, an embossed swastika. after a greedy moment of thought, the peasant kneels to pick up the gold. tchkk!!! a long, shiny blade pierces the peasant's chest from behind. he blinks twice and slumps forward. figure 2 steps out from behind him, a long, bloody blade in his hand. the figures uncover their faces. ilsa has not aged and kroenen, still wears the same tight gas mask. he cleans his blade in the snow and takes back the gold. ilsa watches the sherpa's blood as it runs in a steaming rivulet, tracing a glyph in the grooves and filling the basin. a figure rises from the blood. a naked human shape, haloed by fireflies.}
