<L>__{interior lola's house morning}
<A>__{a ceiling fan rotates slowly... a pair of shorts and a nylon stocking hanging from the blades. the house is a wreck! the camera moves down to ned and lola, both reclining in a big claw foot bathtub, facing each other, their arms draped lazily over the sides. ned's eyes are closed. "in a gadda da vida" plays on the stereo in the b.g. lola's hand reaches for an ice pick on the floor, raising it up slowly. then... click!... ignites the cigarette lighter in the handle, touching the flame to the end of her cigarette. she chips away a big chunk of ice from the block in a silver ice bucket beside her... then sensuously rubs the ice across her breasts. ned winces at the sight of this. lola smiles at him, then lets the chunk of ice slide into the water... and pushes it between ned's legs. he cringes, eyes crossed. the familiar repetition of musical notes from the stereo drones louder... grabbing ned's attention.}

<D>__{that's madam butterfly, isn't it?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{iron butterfly. in a gadda da vida.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(listening)}
<D>__{oh yeah, sure... now i can hear it.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{it tells the sad story of a woman who is rejected by her lover after a brief, but torrid, affair... so she stalks him with an ice pick and stabs him with it more than a thousand times.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{really? i never could understand the lyrics.}
<A>__{he lifts his feet out of the water, dangles them over each side of the tub. he's still wearing one blue sock. lola raises her feet out of the water. she's still wearing her high heel shoes. they are dripping.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{you know, what happened last night was very, uh...}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{yes... it was. i should check on my homeowners insurance.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{but we can't ever let it happen again. ever!}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{what are you saying, ned? that you're rejecting me, your lover, after a brief, but torrid, affair?!}
<A>__{ned pulls his feet in, sits up... suddenly feeling vulnerable. he measures his words very, very carefully.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i wouldn't put it exactly like that. it's just that... well, i'm married to a wonderful woman... who is very, very attractive...}
<P>__{(but adds quickly)}
<D>__{...not that you aren't very attractive!}
<A>__{his voice begins to echo and fade : as the camera moves in to a cu of lola's enraged eyes!}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(voice echoing)}
<D>__{...you aren't very attractive... you aren't very attractive... you aren't very attractive...}
<A>__{and then we see... a close shot of her hand, grasping the ice pick... scratching it along the side of the tub, peeling back the porcelain. a grating screech overlaps to...}
