<L>__{150 interior attic night}
<A>__{chase pushes open the door. a spring coil pulls the creaking door closed behind him. one look at the attic and chase turns pale... a huge window at the far end of the room allows the moonlight to reach all corners of the spacious old attic... all of renee's belongings have been unpacked. the entire attic has been converted into a museum like room, down to the last meticulous detail. a room in preparation for renee's return. gauzy curtains billow out from some unseen draft. pictures of renee rest everywhere. awards. memorabilia... geoff is seated before the brightly lit, three way theatrical mirror, casually setting out renee's make up.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{geoff... what are you doing?}
<A>__{there's an obsessive dementia in geoff's gaze.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{i'm getting things ready for mom.}
<A>__{chase sighs. obviously the strain of drew's funeral has proven too much for geoff. he moves closer.}
<C>__{chase}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{mom is dead, geoff. you know that...}
<A>__{a creepy smile flickers across geoff's face.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{she doesn't have to be.}
<A>__{chase freezes as a chill runs up his spine.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{i can bring her back. the same way drew and me brought zowie back...}
<A>__{at this, chase is positively spooked.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{geoff, this is crazy. zowie didn't die.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{he did. we buried him.}
<P>__{(intense)}
<D>__{there's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.}
<A>__{chase stares at his son. this is insane. it must be. just then, the phone rings downstairs. geoff continues to stare at his father.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{we tried it on zowie first. and then we did it again, when zowie killed gus. drew didn't want gus to be dead, so we brought him back, too...}
<A>__{it's too much for chase. his mouth is hanging agape.}
<C>__{marjorie }
<P>__{(outside the attic door)}
<D>__{doctor matthews, you've got a call. it's the caretaker at the funeral home. something about your wife's grave...}
<A>__{chase nods in private acknowledgement. he stares at geoff as he backs away.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{look, geoff. just... just relax, okay. i'm going to take this call and i will be right back. okay?}
<A>__{geoff doesn't respond. chase pulls open the door and leaves.}
