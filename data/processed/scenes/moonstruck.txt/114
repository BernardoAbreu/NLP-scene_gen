<C>__{mr. johnny}
<D>__{maybe i should go?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{what are you doing here? you're supposed to be in palermo.}
<C>__{mr. johnny}
<D>__{that's what i came to tell loretta. there's been a miracle.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{a miracle. well, that's news.}
<C>__{mr. johnny}
<D>__{my mother's recovered.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{you're kidding?}
<C>__{mr. johnny}
<D>__{the breath had almost totally left her body. she was as white as snow. and then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. the mourners. and me. and herself! she ate a meal that would choke a pig!}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{that's incredible.}
<C>__{mr. johnny}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the front door can be heard slamming, out of view, and then dogs can be heard barking. mr. johnny and rose look to the entranceway. the old man appears there, holding the five dogs.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{hello pop.}
<A>__{the old man looks at rose. he is a specter. he stares, and then he makes a long low accusing noise. then he disappears.}
<C>__{mr. johnny}
<D>__{who was that?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{that was my father in law, who has a wrong idea in his head. listen, johnny, there's a question i want to ask you. and i want you to tell me the truth if you can. why do men chase women?}
<C>__{mr. johnny}
<D>__{well. there's the bible story. god took a rib from adam and made eve. maybe men chase women to get the rib back. when god took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{but why would a man need more than one woman?}
<C>__{mr. johnny}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe because he fears death.}
<A>__{rose leaps up, very excited.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{that's it! that's the reason!}
<C>__{mr. johnny}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{no, that's really it. thank you for answering my question.}
<A>__{the front door slams again. mr. johnny and rose look to the entranceway. cosmo appears there.}
