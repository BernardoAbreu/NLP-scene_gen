<L>__{exterior quonset hut day}
<A>__{the door is opened by a woman in her late twenties. hair pulled back, casual, an artist. she hands the driver a fedex box which is decorated with a drawing of two angel wings. the driver has a hand held computer; a portable printer dangles from his belt. the driver scans the package with his hand held computer, prints out a label and sticks it on the box, ready to go. but something on the box catches her eye. she wants it back. he glances at his watch. she draws rings around the wings, uniting them. she gives the box to the driver, then hands him a cup of coffee. they've done this before. he takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck. he jumps in and heads back onto the plains.}
