<L>__{interior charles trotter's bar night}
<A>__{the hot saloon in chinatown. upscale, downscale, jammed, michael and kimmy at a small table in a far corner. close on them...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{sure you're okay?}
<A>__{she looks really scared. turns her drink in her hand. looking down at it.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it's not just a gag, huh?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{no, it's, uh... a real big favor.}
<A>__{he takes her hand, tenderly.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i wish you'd just... come out with it. i mean why are we waiting for jules?}
<A>__{she smiles up at him. the best she can.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{moral support.}
<A>__{she loves him so much, and she is sick with worry.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{what's good of having a big sister, if she...}
<A>__{stops. gestures with her eyes. because her big sister has just entered... ... looking fabulous. julianne wears a long sleek sarong, slightly see through. her hair is bound up with silver pins. as she moves through the room toward us, we can see that, for once, her make up is flawless, understated. when she arrives at the table... ... michael is beaming, admiringly. he stands up.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{wow and wow. you have a date, after this?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{never can tell.}
<A>__{he holds her chair. she exchanges an intimate smile with the anxious kim.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you make me think of that song, we used to...}
<A>__{and he starts humming. the song is, "the way you look tonight."}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{someday. when i'm awfully low...}
<A>__{they sit. he looks from julianne to his bride.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{okay, kid. you're on.}
<A>__{kim's eyes flick to julianne, who nods, supportively. the kid takes a breath.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{it's really my father. who needs the favor.}
<A>__{his face sort of comes to a stop. nothing she can read, yet. he nods, yeah...?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{he's... he's reorganizing some of the divisions of the company...}
<A>__{his eyes flick to julianne. she looks down.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{he never mentioned that. neither did y...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<P>__{(blurting)}
<D>__{... and public relations is a big problem area for him.}
<A>__{she can see it now. in his eyes. she just can't tell how bad.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{he needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{like family, huh?}
<A>__{so quiet. so cold. she is terrified.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{it would only be, maybe, six months? or three or four? it would mean so much to him...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{to him.}
<A>__{she swallows. straightens her spine.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{and to m...}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(sharp, to julianne)}
<D>__{... and you knew about this.}
<A>__{real quiet. against the noise of this place.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i think you ought to listen to her, michael. this is her life, too.}
<A>__{just the thing. to bring that anger near the surface. he turns to kim...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{well, which is it?}
<A>__{a demand. sharp. accusing. she doesn't like that...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you gonna tell me daddy thought this one up? all of a sudden, i'm the only jerk alive who can help him deal with the press?}
<A>__{she's trapped. angry, scared. a deer in headlights.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{michael!!}
<C>__{kimmy}
<P>__{(near tears)}
<D>__{i am honest!}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{all of a sudden, i'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans i had for my life...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!}
<A>__{he can't even believe he's hearing this.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm sure glad i'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{what is that sup...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{and what am i supposed to do with my life, huh? i am 28 years old! i work in a low paying, low status, zero respect job which, unfortunately, i happen to fucking love. how inconvenient.}
<A>__{shrugs.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no problem. a little bullshit about daddy's "needs," and presto, i'm a lap dog in high society.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(whips around)}
<D>__{does it, really? how come you never took some sell out establishment job? you had plenty of chances!}
<A>__{glares in her eyes.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i will tell you why. because that isn't you. and it isn't me, either! we're the same person!}
<A>__{back to kim...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what a sweet little picture. mommy and daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{well, if that's the way you f...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{damn straight, it's how i feel! what's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "mikey poo"? or do i have to change my name to "binky"?}
<A>__{she's crying now. real tears on her face.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{great! tears! the big equalizer. you wait till two days before the wedding to drop this on me, and i'm just supposed to roll over and drool!}
<A>__{she is sobbing now. she can't help herself. which makes him totally crazy. he jumps up.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{fine. i'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{michael!!}
<A>__{a wrenching cry from her heart. it stops him cold. and before julianne's astonished eyes, kimmy reaches out a trembling hand...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{michael, you are so...}
<A>__{choking back the sobs.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{... so right. and i am so very wrong.}
<A>__{michael blinks. julianne blinks. for different reasons.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{we can't go down two roads. and still be together.}
<A>__{her fingers stretch, beckoning.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{uh, kimmy...?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<P>__{(ignores her)}
<D>__{we settled this. and i reneged. that wasn't fair.}
<A>__{please, please, take my hand.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{you have to forgive me, and forget this ever happened...}
<A>__{people are watching, staring. these two see only each other.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{... or i will die.}
<A>__{a frozen, forever moment. he steps to her... ... lifts her up in his arms. into the deepest, most heartfelt kiss. and as she clings to him, people begins to applaud, and whistle, and laugh. julianne. in her pretty dress. closes her eyes.}
