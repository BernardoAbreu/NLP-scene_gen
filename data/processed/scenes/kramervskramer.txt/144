<B>__{medium shot on billy}
<A>__{as he lies in bed asleep. some time has passed and billy's bandage is much smaller. hold on him as we hear off screen sound: from the street below, the regular six forty five garbage truck that serves as billy's alarm clock.}
<B>__{hold on billy}
<A>__{as he wakes up, struggles to his feet. the camera tracks with him as, eyes closed, he stumbles into the bathroom, pees, and still not remembering to flush the toilet walks into the bedroom and wakes his father. as the child turns and walks toward the kitchen, the camera holds on ted. he heaves himself to his feet and, eyes closed, in much the same manner as his son, stumbles into the bathroom. he automatically flushes the toilet without bothering to look, walks into the living room, opens the front door and picks up the paper. as he starts into the kitchen, he meets billy coming the other way carrying two plates, a doughnut on each. the camera now tracks with billy as he walks into the living room, carefully sets the plates on the dining table, crosses to the television set, and turns it on. he returns to the table, and sits down as ted appears carrying two glasses of orange juice and vitamins. he takes a seat in the chair opposite billy and opens his paper and starts to read. hold on them as they sit without talking, eating their breakfast the only sound, a children's cartoon program coming from the t.v. from time to time ted glances up from his paper to look across at the cartoon. hold on them as we see that they have become roommates in the best sense of the word.}
