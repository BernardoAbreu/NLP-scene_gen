<L>__{exterior city street n dawn}
<A>__{long ago this was a nice area. a banner hangs from an old deco building rooms for rent. mr. brooks is walking through the parking lot beside the building. there, as a first car in a double space is the old green pontiac convertible. it's blocked in by another car. mr. brooks sidles between the cars to check the license plate against the one in his memory. it's the car thorton meeks was in, outside the drug store. mr. brooks walks away.}
