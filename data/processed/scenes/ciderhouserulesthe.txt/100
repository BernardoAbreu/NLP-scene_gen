<L>__{interior dining hall early morning}
<A>__{at one table, the children are happily eating apples; a few of the kids are stuffing apples from a big bowl into their pockets. at another table, larch, edna, and angela sit around an open packing crate of apples. larch takes a bite from an apple and spits it out. angela takes the apple out of his hand.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{that's a pie apple, wilbur. homer said you're not supposed to eat it!}
<A>__{angela hands him another apple.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{so he's an apple expert, is he?}
<A>__{angela gives him a critical look as larch takes a bite out of the new apple.}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{oh my, yes! this is a far superior taste and crisp, too! you know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. i wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{wilbur, he picked them for us himself...}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{you don't find it depressing that homer wells is picking apples?}
<A>__{both edna and angela glower at him.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? a dissertation on apples, we don't need!}
<C>__{edna}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{he probably doesn't make much money picking apples he must have had to pay to send them, too.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{i wouldn't worry, edna, that he doesn't have money. if he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!}
<A>__{larch angrily tosses the half eaten apple into the garbage.}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{wilbur, it's a gift! how can you be angry with homer for sending us a gift?}
<A>__{larch stares into space, depressed. then he examines the crate and finds the mailing label that says "ocean view orchards cape kenneth, maine." he rips it off, holds it up triumphantly.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{i will show him a gift! i will give him a gift he can use!}
<A>__{larch storms out of the room.}
