<A>__{peace and quiet at last. renai gropes in behind the bookcase, plucking a hidden jewelry box free. she pinches a cigarette out of it and lights it. she sits down at her piano, feeling the keys, warming her fingers up. sunlight streams in through the windows. she takes out a notebook, filled with scribbled handwriting. she places the notebook on the sheetstand, then sets a small, mechanical metronome in motion and begins tapping out a sombre melody in time with it.}

<D>__{yeah, i'm looking west, always been looking that way, gonna get it all happening, just can't do it today...}
<A>__{she stops and makes a note in her book. she starts over, rising to the emotion of the song. she's got a good voice.}

<D>__{yeah, i'm looking west, always been looking that way, i'm gonna be somebody, i just can't be her today }
<A>__{she is interrupted by the tinny sound of a baby crying. she stops playing and looks over at a baby monitor, the source of the noise. renai deflates, her shoulders sagging in defeat. she closes her notebook and leaves the room.}
