<L>__{interior galaxie moving}
<A>__{vernon drives, oola at his side. in the back, crabtree puffs philosophically on a kool while grady sits grimly with the sad remains of his manuscript: seven rumpled pages, one of which bears the watermark of a shoe printerior}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{naturally you have copies.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i have an alternate version of the first chapter.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{you'll be all right then. look at carlyle, when he lost his luggage.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{that was maccaulay.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{or hemingway, when hadley lost all those stories.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{he was never able to reproduce them.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{bad examples. look, tripp, i don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps in a sense this }
<P>__{(nodding to the pages)}
<D>__{is for the best.}
<A>__{grady's eyes shift, study crabtree.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{kind of a sign, you're saying.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{in a sense.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i don't think so. in my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{let me get this straight. all that paper that went into the river. that was the only copy?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{'fraid so.}
<C>__{vernon}
<P>__{(glowering at crabtree)}
<D>__{and you're saying it's some kind of sign? what the fuck's the matter with you?}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{i'm just saying that sometimes, subconsciously, a person will put themselves in a situation perhaps even create that situation in order to have an arena in which to work out an unresolved issue. it's a covert way, if you will, of addressing a problem.}
<A>__{vernon stares at crabtree as if he's from another planet.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{i will tell you the problem. you behind the wheel. there's your fucking problem.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{that's pretty simplistic, don't you think?}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{excuse me. did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{he was trying to steal my car!}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{ail right, all right it's done. there's no need to talk about it. it's done.}
<A>__{they ride in silence for a moment, then oola turns, glances at grady and his little sheaf of pages.}
<C>__{oola}
<D>__{so what was it about?}
<P>__{(as grady looks up)}
<D>__{your book. what was the story?}
<A>__{grady stares into oola's sweet, brown eyes.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<A>__{oola's brow wrinkles. crabtree glances at his old friend, genuine compassion in his eyes.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{what he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. it lives in the mind.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? i mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i couldn't stop.}
