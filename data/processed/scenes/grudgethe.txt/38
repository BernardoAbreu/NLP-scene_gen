<A>__{close on the same package, a microwaveable soup bowl, now open with a spoon sticking out of it. resting, with a glass of water, atop the kotatsu table. pan to reveal a pair of feet on the lip of a moving box next to the table. it's jennifer, asleep on the couch. a clattering sound wakes her, followed by the sound of footsteps running away. we pull back as jennifer sees her bowl, and the glass next to it, have been knocked over. she sits up, looking into the tatami room. emma sits on the edge of her mattress, staring blankly at her. jennifer gets up, sternly walks over.}

<A>__{she stops short as she sees... footprints. formed from the broth, and noodles, of her spilled soup. they're the footprints of a child. and they lead away from the back room, down the main hallway. jennifer looks back up to see emma watching her.}
