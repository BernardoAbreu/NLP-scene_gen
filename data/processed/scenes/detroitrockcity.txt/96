<A>__{your wildest fantasy of a rock show's backstage area come true. the place is packed with "beautiful" people. scantily clad babes everywhere. slick, record biz types. lots of food. lots of booze. lots of fun. it's backstage at a kiss concert, come on! camera tilts up above the partying hordes to find lex shimming along an exposed duct amid the pipes, sprinklers, and vents. looking straight down on everybody, lex is in awe and disbelief.}
