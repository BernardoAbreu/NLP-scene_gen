<D>__{... shit shit shit!}
<A>__{he rolls behind a crushed riot van and opens up in the direction the shell came from, ash and debris from the impact still raining down... and then: from behind, he's nailed in the back by a swung length of iron pipe. he half crumples, spins hackman. hackman swings again, knocking the weapon out of kable's hand; it skitters across the concrete. simon is completely freaked it's happening too fast, no time to react... he tries to engage hand to hand but every move pings a step late... kable swings a fist; hackman dodges easily. hackman is moving too naturally as if he's under his own control. hackman slams the pipe off the side of kable's head, dropping him then tosses the pipe away... and pulls out a nasty, high tech looking shotgun. he stands over kable and points the barrel at his face.}
<C>__{hackman}
<P>__{(friendly)}
<D>__{bye kable.}
<A>__{he squeezes the trigger... the submarine alarm sounds. floodlights crank up. the leds on hackman's gun power down with an audible down cycle... a shell, undetonated, drops from the barrel and plops onto kable's forehead.}
<C>__{hackman }
<D>__{what happened?}
