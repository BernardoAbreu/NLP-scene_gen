<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{thank you, edward, we are all very well.}
<A>__{there is a pause while they all search for an appropriate remark. finally margaret decides to have a go at polite conversation.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{we have been enjoying very fine weather.}
<A>__{marianne looks at her incredulously.}
<C>__{margaret}

<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i hope you have left mrs ferrars well?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{tolerably, thank you.}
<A>__{there is another bone crunching pause.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i but edward cannot seem to find any words.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{is mrs ferrars at the new parish?}
<A>__{edward looks extremely confused.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{no my mother is in town.}
<A>__{he plucks up the courage to look at elinor again and is evidently not much comforted by what he sees.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{i meant to enquire after mrs edward ferrars.}
<A>__{edward colours. he hesitates.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{then you have not heard the news i think you mean my brother you mean mrs robert ferrars.}
<A>__{they all stare at him in shock.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{mrs robert ferrars?}
<A>__{elinor has frozen. edward rises and goes to the window.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{yes. i received a letter from miss steele or mrs ferrars, i should say communicating the... the transfer of her affections to my brother robert. they were much thrown together in london, i believe, and... and in view of the change in my circumstances, i felt it only fair that miss steele be released from our engagement. at any rate, they were married last week and are now in plymouth.}
<A>__{elinor rises suddenly, edward turns and they stand looking at one another.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{then you are not married.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{elinor bursts into tears. the shock of this emotional explosion stuns everyone for a second and then marianne makes an executive decision. wordlessly, she takes margaret's hand and leads her and mrs dashwood out of the room.}
