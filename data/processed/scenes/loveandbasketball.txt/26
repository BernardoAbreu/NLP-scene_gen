<A>__{fourth quarter. one minute left. cougars down three. monica dribbles down court, bouncing with confidence as her opponent plays her tight. monica zips a no look pass to a teammate, who lays it up. quincy punches one of his friends "oh shit!" she is having the game of her life. on the defensive end, monica steals the ball. she drives the length of the court, lays it up between two defenders. the crowd is hyped. twenty seconds left, up by one. monica hounds the opposing guard as she brings up the ball. monica suddenly reaches in and knocks the ball loose. as she goes for the ball, a whistle.}

<A>__{monica catches herself, turns the word "shit" into a frustrated yell as she quickly moves away from the ref. monica lines up for the free throw, clenching her fists. the girl hits the first one. then, she hits the second. with ten seconds left, down by one, monica drives down court and throws up a prayer. everyone is on their feet as the ball spins around the rim. and then...it pops out. an opposing player grabs the rebound and monica has no choice but to foul her. monica has just fouled out. she walks to her bench and drops down. she buries her face in a towel and sobs. the buzzer goes off. cougars lose. quincy stares at monica, feeling almost as bad as she does.}
