<L>__{90a interior queenshithe slaughterhouse assembly line}
<A>__{holmes drops on to the machine and leaps from gear to gear like stepping stones. he heaves himself up to the conveyor, where irene is being pulled down the assembly line towards the flames. watson sprints ahead, looking for a shut off switch. holmes unties irene's gag.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it's your turn in shackles this time.}
<A>__{ahead of them, the pig carcass is scorched in an overwhelming burst of flame. holmes and irene are nexterior}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{but this time no key, unfortunately.}
<A>__{holmes notes that irene's hands are shackled to separate hooks. it's going to take two actions to free her. the flame machine gurgles ominously, gearing up for the next blast. watson sees a lever (please note, new prop!) that looks promising, turns to head for it then his eyes focus on a big canvas splatter cloth.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i've been meaning to ask you something }
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{well, i'm a captive audience.}
<A>__{watson rips down the splatter cloth, sprints to holmes and irene, tosses the cloth across the conveyor belt to holmes who wraps them up in the thick cloth just before the flames hit them. the heat is excruciating but the cloth protects them. watson watches anxiously as the scorched cloth drops away, revealing that holmes and irene made it just. relieved, watson heads for the lever until "oh shit!" he looks ahead sees the scorched pig carcass being dragged into a long, conveyor belt wide scalding tank of boiling water. decision time for watson help holmes and irene, or try the lever? he goes for the lever, reaches it, pushes it all the way over and the belt speeds up with a jerk. watson hauls back on the lever, gets the belt back to the original speed, looks around for another possible off switch. just as they reach the scalding tank, holmes jumps off the belt (still opposite side to watson), grabs irene's legs and pulls her horizontal just before she's dragged into the boiling water. she's suspended just above the boiling water, with holmes moving sideways, keeping pace with her.}
<C>__{irene}
<P>__{(trying her best not to show the strain)}
<D>__{you had a question.}
<A>__{holmes keeps hold of irene's feet as he maneuvers past various obstacles }
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(same)}
<D>__{ah. yes. do you still maintain you're not in over your head?}
<C>__{irene}
<P>__{(panting)}
<D>__{in some countries steam is considered excellent therapy for the skin.}
<A>__{ then is gouged in the back by a whirling fan belt, jerks away, and irene touches the water, screams. watson hears the scream, turns then sees something again. it pisses him off. fuck this machine. when holmes has irene stable again:}
<C>__{irene}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{i have to say it's overrated.}
<A>__{holmes has to admire her courage until he hears watson yelling at him. up ahead a huge pipe spews boiling water into the tank and impassable obstacle from holmes' side of the conveyor belt. watson points at the i beam running above them. holmes nods. irene sees it, too. holmes helps her reach one foot, then other up to the i beam. she hooks her feet over it, and is suspended upside down by her shackles and her feet and still heading for the pipe spewing boiling water. watson appears opposite holmes, nods up at irene. she swings off the i beam, through the air and watson catches her feet, pulls her horizontal, facing the other way just in time to avoid the gush of boiling water. as watson holds irene, he spots a small, but significant looking switch on the wall, painted red. (please note, new prop!) watson helps irene back onto the conveyor belt, leaves her for holmes to deal with, sprints for the switch. irene rides the belt upwards. holmes clambers the equipment, following her. up ahead, the scorched, scalded pig carcass precedes them. holmes darts through a trimming station, with cleavers hanging from chains, grabs one, jumps onto the belt, catches up to irene just as they both see the pig carcass cut in half:}
<B>__{lengthways by a giant bandsaw.}
<A>__{holmes wastes no time, swings the meat cleaver at the lock shackling irene's left hand. sparks fly as metal kisses metal, but that's all. she's still shackled. then both of them see that watson has reached the switch. whew! watson looks at them with relief close one and pulls the switch down with a really satisfying clunk! a bank of lights goes out but the conveyor belt keeps moving towards the giant band saw. shit a brick.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{sherlock?}
<A>__{now, she's showing nerves. so is sherlock. he braces himself on the belt, swings the cleaver with all his might smashes the shackle lock. irene swings sideways violently, still shackled by her right hand. the bandsaw whines viciously. irene swings aside, just misses it. gets a free haircut. then holmes is under her, lifting her high so that she can free her right hand (a move not possible with both shackles). irene unhooks herself, falls forward, taking holmes with her. they plummet downwards out of frame. watson sprints towards where they fell, looks down sees them lying on a carpet of scorched, boiled, cut in half pig carcasses. they're okay. watson shakes his head, turns, heads for the door, looking for blackwood. irene gives holmes a sweet, grateful smile }
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{thank you so much. i owe you.}
<A>__{ pulls a knife, gets up, heads after watson. holmes grabs her, stops her.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you owe me information.}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{no more games, irene.}
<A>__{she hears watson opening the door to the dock. she looks at holmes, their eyes locking. finally, the truth:}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{blackwood's manufactured large scale weapons for years. lately there've been rumors of something new. more powerful than anything else. and... magical. my job is to find out if the rumors are true.}
<C>__{irene }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i would say they are.}
<A>__{and she's off, running toward the door. holmes trails her, processing. they blast through the doors to }
