<A>__{the other officers turn and look as graham walks by them. he walks on, unaware of the stares. he slows as he reaches the back bumper of the truck. it sticks out onto the road a few feet. he comes around the side of the vehicle. colleen hess is beautiful in a delicate way. her straight brown hair falls down over her small face. she leans over the front bumper of the truck onto the hood. her head rests on her arms like a child resting on a school desk. her back is against a tree. the lower half of her is obscured by the truck. she's able to raise her head and shoulders as graham walks up to her. she is shivering slightly.}
