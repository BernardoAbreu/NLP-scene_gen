<L>__{interior yesterdaze short time later}
<A>__{randy follows cassidy toward the back of the store. he looks around, taking in the array of funky `50s '60s '70s clothes.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{this is awesome...}
<P>__{(rubs hands together, psyched)}
<D>__{we are gonna find something great!}
<A>__{cassidy is less loose and playful than randy, much more in business mode. they come to the back where, against the wall, she finds what she's looking for: a bunch of cardboard boxes bursting with a wildly eclectic assortment of tops, skirts, pants, etc. she starts sifting through.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{do you know her size?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{she's kinda skinny, a little shorter than you.}
<A>__{cassidy spots a fun, multi color mini skirt. she pulls it out.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{could you see her in this?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{maybe.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{not really.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm not sure.}
<A>__{cassidy tosses it back in. she unearths a flashdance style}
<B>__{sweatshirt.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{what about this?}
<A>__{randy makes a sour face. she tosses it back.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{so like, what is she? goth? punk? hippie?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{preppy? stoner?}
<A>__{randy ponders the choices.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{not really...}
<A>__{cassidy lets out a good natured groan of frustration. randy watches as she continues searching.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{hey, pam?}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{thank you very much.}
<A>__{cassidy looks at him. she can feel his sincere appreciation.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{she returns to searching. sift, sift, sift, sift...}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i think she might be a lesbian.}
<A>__{cassidy stops sifting. she looks up at him.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{does that help?}
<A>__{cassidy leads randy by the arm over to the... men's area: cassidy heads to a rack of clothes. she quickly zeroes in on a retro bowling shirt. she holds it up to randy, who makes a scrunched up face.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{ah, maybe she's just a friend.}
<A>__{cassidy puts the bowling shirt back. as she does, something catches randy's eye.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{what's that?}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{the green.}
<A>__{cassidy holds up the item for randy.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{this?}
<A>__{an excited look comes over randy's face.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{it's perfect.}
<A>__{randy's pov: a satin green roller disco jacket. embroidered on the left breast is a big "s" in purple script. it's ugly. cassidy looks at the jacket. she clearly finds it awful. she looks at randy, who's beaming with excitement and pride. she finds it very endearing.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{i agree.}
