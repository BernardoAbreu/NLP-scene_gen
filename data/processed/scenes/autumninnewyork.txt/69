<A>__{wills stands off to the side, wearing his devil's horns, sipping a drink, watching an eight year old boy bob for apples, while other boys and girls cheer him on. john, wearing his king costume, supervises, as the boy, wildly sputtering, struggles to bite into a renegade granny smith.}

<A>__{sarah, smiling curiously, heads to the back stairwell. she sees wills standing there. watching the kids, his eyes are filled with the same sort of wistful yearning that she noticed at the toy store she gives him an affectionate poke in the stomach as she passes by and disappears upstairs. finally, the boy grabs the apple in his teeth and lifts his soaked head to the cheers of his friends. then he grabs it out of his mouth and begins taking big bites out of it until he uncovers a silver dollar. wills laughs at the kids' excitement. a moment later a woman's gloved hands cover his eyes.}
