<L>__{interior westminster abbey that night}
<A>__{the last of the preparation crew are being scurried out by lang. he gives a final, satisfied, look at the cavernous space, like a director preparing the stage for a final scene. he quotes shakespeare, extremely pleased with himself:}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{"the play's the thing, wherein i will catch the conscience of a king."}
<A>__{he exits. the camera explores various elements: the throne of edward the confessor. beneath it, a large rough hewn stone: the stone of scone. leaning against the throne, a huge sword, set there for the next coronation rehearsal. majestic stained glass windows of saints, kings, and martyrs. rows of pews, worn with centuries of use. graves of the mighty: kings, poets, and statesmen. this abbey holds the history of a nation. footsteps resonate. lionel enters. trips over one of the gravestones.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{bertie? blast! stepped on lord byron. bertie...?}
<A>__{lights snap on skewering lionel. bertie steps into view wearing a coat against the night chill of the stone cathedral.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{this is not a rehearsal, "doctor" logue.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{ah, the star chamber inquisition. i wondered when that would happen. and i'd promised myrtle a new frock.}
<C>__{bertie}
<P>__{(barely controlled)}
<D>__{"just call me lionel"! never did you call yourself `doctor'. we did that for you. no diploma, no training, no credentials. just a great deal of nerve.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{want to hear my side of the story?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{there isn't a "your side of the story". this is my story. and you've ruined it! its not just the coronation, terrifying enough, its the radio speech to millions afterwards, and the speech after that, and for the rest of my failed miserable life!}
<C>__{lionel}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{wembley stadium...}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{you dare remind me?!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i was there.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{then you knew from the start i was hopeless?!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{my son, valentine, asked, "could you help that poor man?" i replied, "he's too old for me to manage a complete cure, but i could very nearly do it, i'm sure of that."}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{lying bastard!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i knew i could help you. you refuse to believe?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{in you?!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{in yourself.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{who the hell do you think you are?!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{a failed actor.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{actor?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{father wanted me to be a doctor, but i couldn't cut flesh. so i worked in the mines, recited in pubs...}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{an actor?!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{when the war came, by the time i was ready to be shipped out, the first casualties were limping home. poor buggers, broken in bone and spirit. `lionel, you're good with your mouth, see if you can help these poor sods.' the shell shocked were the saddest. most stuttered profoundly. far worse than you. muscle therapy helped somewhat, but i found i had to go deeper, as you might well imagine.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i know nothing of those poor men!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i think you do. they had cried out, and the universe had not listened. so they'd lost faith in their voice. my job was to make them shout in righteous anger: "i have the right to be heard!"}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i suppose that helped them, did it?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{make inquiries.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{inquiries have been made! no credentials.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{but a lot of success. no training was given.}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{not in western australia, not at that time. i simply knew what to do. when the war was over i kept being a therapist to earn a living. when the lads were old enough, i thought, "alright lionel, you've always wanted to be an actor, one last go." i pretended it was our trip home to mother england, the great australian pilgrimage.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{to harley street?!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{cashed in our return tickets. i had three months rent.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{so you set yourself up on harley street as an actor? harley street, don't you know, is for doctors!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{the plaque says, `l. logue. speech specialist'. no mention of a medical degree. no mention of any degree. some of the diggers i'd helped had come to england. they made referrals. my practice flourished. my acting, however, did not.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{well enough to deceive me.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{lock me in the tower.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i would if i could!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{what crime?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{you've saddled this nation in its moment of peril with a voiceless king. destroyed the happiness of my family...all for the sake of ensnaring a star client you knew you couldn't possibly assist!}
<A>__{lionel sits down on the chair of edward the confessor. leaning against it is the great two handed sword of st. george.}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{what're you doing? get up!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i'm tired.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{you can't sit there!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{why not? it's a chair.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{it's the chair of edward the confessor! the throne upon which every king for six and a half centuries has been crowned.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{it's falling apart. people have carved their initials into it. needs a stone to keep from blowing away.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{that's the stone of scone! the stone of destiny that was once jacob's pillow.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{you believe such ballocks i don't care how many royal backsides have sat on it, it's a building block with handles attached. you're just like me, an actor with tawdry stage props you choose to believe are real.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{listen to me... !}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{listen to you?! by what right?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{divine right, if you must! i'm your king!!!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{noooo you're not! told me so yourself. said you didn't want it. so why should i listen to a poor stuttering bloke who can't put one word after another? why waste my time listening to you?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{because i have a right to be heard!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{heard as what?!}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{a man! i have a voice!!!}
<C>__{lionel}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{well then...you're cured.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{stop trying to squirm off the hook.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{bertie, you'll make a bloody good king. and you know it.}
<A>__{bertie stares at him. a familiar voice is heard from the shadows.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{your majesty?}
<A>__{the archbishop of canterbury.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{you'll be relieved to learn i've found a replacement specialist. impeccable credentials.}
<A>__{there's a long silence.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{that won't be necessary.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{the matter's already been settled. for your own well being.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{your majesty's function is to consult...and to be advised. you didn't consult, but you've just been advised.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{now i advise you, so listen carefully. ...in this personal matter i will make my own decision.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{may i remind you, you do not place the crown upon your own head.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{and may i remind you, it is my head upon which the crown is placed!}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{this will end badly.}
<A>__{lang turns on his heel. lionel ignores what has just happened.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{in hushed tones the bbc commentator paints a picture for the world, as you stand at the altar divested of your robes. trumpets echo through the abbey. the incessant rain clears miraculously as a shaft of sun streams through the stained glass window catching your golden tunic and bathing you in light like a mediaeval knight. and you are king!}
<A>__{the faint clicking whir of a film projector is heard.}
