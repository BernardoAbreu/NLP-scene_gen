<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{she turns around, leading trevor through the hall like a horse. a very confused horse.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{tawny? what's what are you doing?}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{you!}
<A>__{trevor eyes her gorgeous body and decides not to resist quite so much.}
<L>__{interior tawny's kitchen night}
<A>__{trevor leans against the counter, sipping at a glass of wine nervously. right next to him, tawny's at the stove, stirring a pot of something dark and bubbly. she looks up at him, smiling seductively. but trevor's still a few lengths behind.}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i'm, uh, not sure... feeling kind of weird actually.}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{tawny grabs trevor's balls and he jumps away as if jolted by a cattle prod.}
<C>__{tawny }
<D>__{i'm kinda feeling nuts myself!}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?}
<C>__{tawny}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{god. sometimes you can be such an animal. other times you are the ultimate tease...}
<A>__{she holds up a spoonful of what she's been stirring. it looks like stew.}
<C>__{tawny }
<D>__{taste this.}
<A>__{keeping a hand below his waist trevor leans toward the spoon, tastes, licks his lips. then squints.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{wow. that's good. lots of capers, huh?}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{for starters. it's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard on stew.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{not a very appetizing name.}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{have some more.}
<A>__{trevor takes another sip of it.}
<C>__{tawny }
<D>__{if you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{you must have been very proud of yourselves...}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{it's getting hot in here.}
<A>__{tawny summarily unzips her rubber dress and whips it off. trevor is speechless. tawny's body is covered with bites and bruises.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{jesus... who did that to you?}
<A>__{tawny busts out laughing.}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{you're kidding right?}
<A>__{trevor shakes his head no.}
<C>__{tawny }
<D>__{you did! god, you are funny tonight.}
<A>__{tawny approaches trevor who tenses up.}
<C>__{tawny }
<D>__{almost like i'm with somebody else.}
<A>__{trevor starts looking very ill.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{tawny i think i'm going to be sick.}
<C>__{tawny}
<D>__{well now there's a compliment.}
<A>__{trevor grabs his stomach, lurching over. he can't breath. trevor looks up at tawny. but it is no longer her. tawny has changed into something else entirely.}
<B>__{a cenobite.}
<A>__{the cenobite rips trevor's shirt open, and we can see movement within his abdomen. like a baby kicking. whatever's in their shoots up expanding trevor's chest cavity. the cenobite pins trevor to the wall and hovers in his face as if about to kiss him. before trevor can scream he is choking. the cenobite watches with glee as something begins to move up into trevor's throat, expanding his neck, forcing his jaws open and finally... ... a black eel pokes its head out of trevor's mouth. the cenobite opens its own mouth and the eel starts to crawl inside it. meanwhile trevor's about to pass out from asphyxiation when }
