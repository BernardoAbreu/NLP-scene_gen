<L>__{interior conor's home}
<A>__{romirez is seated at a table. his back to the spaniard, conor is preparing some food.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{i haven't much to offer, mr. romirez from spain, but you're welcome to what's here.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{please go to no trouble.}
<A>__{romirez is looking at the faint, pale hint of a scar that runs from conor's shoulder blade to his waist.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{five years past me clan fought another over some thing i cannot even re member.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{your marks would suggest great injury.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{i was nearly killed.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{but you lived.}
<A>__{conor looks up from his work in pained memory.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{i did at that.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{and but for a mark you are well as any man, no?}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{aye.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{i should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation. and a solution.}
<A>__{something isn't right. conor turns and faces him.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{i was driven out.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{and now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{how can you know this?}
<C>__{romirez}
<P>__{(tone lightens)}
<D>__{first food, no? a good meal makes conversation so much easier.}
<A>__{stunned with the implications of what romirez has said, like a robot conor serves the meal. his eyes never leave romirez, who digs hungrily into the food.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{hmm, que rico. what is it you call this?}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{pheasant.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{you scots have a way with game. it still has life in it. spirit. back home the food is so...domestic.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{i was sent by his majesty of spain to inverness as a con sultant on matters of metal.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{you're a long way from inverness.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{in my travels i heard the story of the macleod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this earth.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{you know me home. me name.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{it was time for our paths to cross.}
<A>__{romirez pulls back the sleeve on his cloak.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{you see this?}
<A>__{he traces some discoloration on his arm.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{when i was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me. all thought i would die or be maimed for life. but i healed quickly. and like you i paid the price for being different.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{you are the same?}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{do you ever feel a flow, as if some thing were pushing against you?}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{yes. always.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{does it change with me in the room?}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{it is less.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{you feel you know me.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{i don't know why.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{we are brothers.}
