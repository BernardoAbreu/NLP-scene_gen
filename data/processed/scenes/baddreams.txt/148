<L>__{interior cynthia's room night}
<A>__{he slams the door and rams the metal chair log into the bolt latch to secure the door. sirens and bells continue. alan looks over. the room is dark, except for the red light flashing on and off. cynthia is crouched in the far corner by the open window. we can see that the room is otherwise empty of anybody.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{get out of here. i want to do it!}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(going to her)}
<D>__{no. cynthia, please. i'm not going to be able to come back, but you have to listen! berrisford's been tampering with the medication for everybody in the group that's why they've been committing suicide he's been making them crazy }
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{but harris comes to me... he speaks to me }
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{a drug induced psychotic state is very suggestible. all we've hearing for days is "harris, harris,"... so that's what we all saw... that's what i saw when i took ralph's pill! it's all part of berrisford's plan he has this fucked up theory about how you still think you're part of the unity house, and the only way he can prove it is if you want to kill yourself!}
<A>__{behind alan, the dark shape of berrisford emerges from outside the window. it is climbing inside from the ledge.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{do you hear me?! he's going to want you to kill yourself! he's recreating the whole thing for you! but you can't listen to him!}
<A>__{cynthia is getting hysterical. berrisford stands behind alan with a scalpel.}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{dr. goldman.}
<A>__{alan turns around. berrisford bashes him in the head, neatly slicing off some skin. alan flies against the wall. the gun is knocked away. alan writhes a little, then dips into unconsciousness, cynthia is a basket case. she looks at alan.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no... no... no...}
<A>__{berrisford comes to her and starts giving her an injection. she calms herself. she looks at him dreamily. cynthia's pov she sees harris gazing at her lovingly.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{only one thing matters.}
<A>__{she touches his face.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{our love. we'll be together. all of us.}
<A>__{berrisford taken alan's gun.}
