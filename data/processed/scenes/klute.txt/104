<L>__{exterior dock: klute day}
<A>__{klute walks a longer distance this time, sits down on one of the pilings of the dock. watching him we see what might be a profound awe and grief at all these things but is, in fact, a good deal more. effects, o.s. as police vehicles are loaded, driven away and as tug toots, runs up engines, puts out again. trask moves into scene, sits on another piling, looks at him speculatively. silence. then }
<C>__{trask}
<D>__{that's how the other one died, you know. in the water.}
<C>__{klute}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i looked it up.}
<A>__{then (we are assuming a complete understanding here between klute and trask, non verbal. what trask is asking, in effect, is: is this meaningful? do we both suspect the same man?)}
<C>__{trask}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{yeah.}
