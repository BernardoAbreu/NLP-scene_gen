<A>__{duke collars gonzo serious.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{well? what are your plans?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{plans?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{lucy.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(struggling to focus)}
<D>__{shit. i met her on the plane and i had all that acid.}
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<D>__{you know, those little blue barrels. i gave her a cap before i realized... she's a religious freak... jesus, she's never even had a drink.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{well... it'll probably work out. we can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.}
<A>__{gonzo stares uneasily at duke.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. it's terrible.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{she's perfect for this gig. these cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. we can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.}
<A>__{gonzo's face twitches badly.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{jesus christ. i knew you were sick but i never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{it's straight economics. this girl is a god send. shit, she can make us a grand a day.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{no! stop talking like that.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{i figure she can do about four at a time. christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. maybe three.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{you filthy bastard. i should cave your fucking head in.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{in a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering jesus based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel samoan who fed her liquor and lsd, dragged her to a vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.}
<A>__{gonzo starts crying.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{no! i felt sorry for the girl, i wanted to help her!}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{you'll go straight to the gas chamber. and even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to nevada for rape and consensual sodomy. she's got to go.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{shit, it doesn't pay to try to help somebody these days.}
<A>__{a silence.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{the only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. but, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: my attorney.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{we have to cut her loose. she's got two hundred dollars. and we can always call the cops up there in montana, where she lives, and turn her in.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{what?... what kind of goddamn monster are you?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{it just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. anything that she says about us is completely worthless.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{us?}
