<L>__{exterior space earth orbit}
<A>__{as the phoenix rockets into space...}
<L>__{interior phoenix cockpit}
<A>__{as before.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{three... two... one... mark!}
<L>__{exterior space the phoenix}
<A>__{the rocket booster shuts down as the ship leaves earth's orbit and coasts on its momentum. after a beat, the first stage booster separates from the ship and drops away, leaving three quarters of the ship in space.}
<L>__{interior borg hive}
<A>__{close on data, head tilted back, eyes closed, smiling...a few droplets of water fall from above onto his face. he smiles wider, reveling in the sensation.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{data is still restrained on the table, but a conduit has been placed above his head and is dripping condensation onto his face. data is now a completely new being. his entire body is now made of human flesh. it's a shocking sight for anyone who ever wondered what data would look like human, we're now getting our first look.}
<B>__{the borg queen}
<A>__{descends from her nest in the ceiling. she watches data for a moment... rubs the moisture into his face.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{a borg in all but name.}
<A>__{data, although clearly enraptured with his new sensations and feelings still struggles to maintain his own sense of identity.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(weak)}
<D>__{i am... grateful for what you have given me. but i still do not wish to be assimilated.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{a universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?}
<A>__{to his surprise, data finds that he is becoming drawn to this strange creature and all that she can offer him.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{then take the final step... give me the enterprise... and we can be together... always.}
<A>__{he struggles, but ultimately there's only one answer.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{no... i cannot.}
<A>__{without taking her eyes away from data, she reaches out a hand and touches a control on a nearby console. the color of data's face turns an ashen gray as though the blood has drained from his skin. another droplet of moisture falls and hits him on the cheek but this time his eyes widen in shock. the sensation of human feeling is gone.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{i've deactivated the sensory inputs. that flesh on your body is just meat, now.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{no... no, please... you cannot...}
<A>__{she moves in close on him, an edge creeping into her voice:}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{you must give me what i want... now. without the deflector dish, we can no longer send for an early invasion. we must assimilate earth ourselves. i need this ship.}
<A>__{she hits the control, and the color returns to his face. data gasps filled with feeling once again. the borg queen runs her hand across his cheek her attitude seductive and affectionate once again.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{isn't it better like this...?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{yes... but the enterprise... my duty...}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{... is to yourself. don't make me hurt you again...}
<A>__{she touches the control again. data is shocked back into his cold, android self. he's like a heroin addict being denied his "high" with the flick of a switch.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{no... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... i need it...}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{and i need to control this ship. let me into your mind.}
<A>__{data struggles, anguished... we've never seen him like this before... completely beaten down... finally, he nods. the borg queen touches the control again. a sharp intake of breath as the feeling returns to data. and the queen kisses him on the mouth. this time, he responds eagerly, throwing himself into the emotion of the moment. she pulls back a little, looks at him softly, passionately. data stares back at her, breathless he seems to be completely in her thrall.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{in order to access my neural net... you will need to create a positronic interface.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will tell you how.}
<A>__{off the borg queen's smile of victory...}
