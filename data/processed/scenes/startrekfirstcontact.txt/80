<A>__{moments later. picard and geordi are looking at the three cloth printed photographs seen earlier the headshot of cochrane and two different angles of the three cloth printed photographs seen earlier the warp ship with people working on it. picard spreads them out on the desk.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{yeah, i looked at these already.}
<A>__{geordi points to a photo of the ship a worker is walking in front of the throttle assembly, blocking most of it from view.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{you can almost see the throttle assembly in this one... but this guy walked in front of it when they took the picture.}
<A>__{picard considers, absently sticks his hand in his jacket pocket. he pulls out the canister of balm scrimm gave him and tosses it onto the table.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{could you reconstruct the throttle from a photograph like this... if that man wasn't blocking the view?}
<A>__{geordi thinks it over.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{maybe...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sure. yeah. as long as i could get a clear look at the intake configuration. but so far, we haven't found any other photos.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(staring at photos)}
<D>__{if there are other photographs... i think i may know how to find them.}
