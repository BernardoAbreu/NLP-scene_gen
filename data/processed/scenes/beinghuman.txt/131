<L>__{exterior camp morning}
<A>__{in the morning hector and bobby are taking readings from the instruments they have hung on a large tree, main taining the disciplines of their work. it gives some shape and meaning to their predicament.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{barometer... twenty eight and three eighths... temperature... low... thirty four... high... forty two and a half... time...}
<A>__{hector writes it in the log book. bobby goes to the horse and takes a brass chronometer from a box strapped to the saddle. hector takes out a smaller chronometer from his own pack. they compare readings. there is a difference of some four or five minutes in the time.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{it's getting worse... you're nearly five minutes fast now...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i'm not fast... you're slowing down.}
<A>__{they obviously have this tiff every morning.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{what's the point of having two chronometers when you don't take the average?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{exactly... you should throw yours away.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you're unscientific, bobby... at heart...}
<A>__{hector writes in the book. he speaks pointedly.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{seven twenty five...}
<A>__{bobby mocks him with a laugh.}
