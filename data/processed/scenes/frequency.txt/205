<L>__{exterior central park lake continuous}
<A>__{murky water, thick with dirt and slime, 5' deep. frank's hanging on to shepard's arm, trying to wrestle the gun free. but shepard's using his free hand to gouge frank's eyes. frank bites down hard on shepard's wrist. the gun sinks silently to the muddy lake bottom. but shepard gets both hands on frank's throat. shoving his head into the shallow water. shepard's grip is like a vise, frank futilely tries to pry shepard's fingers open. frank is blinded by polluted water. starting to lose consciousness. desperately, he searches the muddy lake bottom for the gun. but he's getting weaker, fading out... then he feels something. a brick, fallen off the bridge, half buried in the mud. frank struggles to dig it up. summons his last ounces of strength, yanking it back and forth, it's getting loose. but shepard's hands are squeezing tighter. frank finally goes limp. a few last bubbles float to the surface. shepard smiles. catching his breath, slightly loosens grip on frank's lifeless neck. frank springs off the lake bottom, rises out of the water like a jack in the box. holding the brick with both hands, he swings. contact. the brick smashes against shepard's head. knocking him to yesterday. he drops like a rock. frank waits for shepard to come up for air. nothing. frank crawls out of the water, collapsing onto the embankment. he just lies there, heart pounding, chest heaving. and suddenly, frank is startled by a massive roar the sound of eight million new yorkers screaming in unison. the mets have just won the world series. frank laughs, slowly getting to his feet.}
