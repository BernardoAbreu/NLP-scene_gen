<D>__{the weston women head for the house.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{my girls all together. hearing you just now gave me a warm feeling. violet, sits on the swing in the semi darkness, smoking, her hair wrapped in a towel. they hadn't seen her. how long has she been there? "august" 10 23 12 blue draft}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you had a bath?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{uh huh...}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you need something to eat? more coffee?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{no, honey, i'm fine.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{this house must have heard a lot of weston girl secrets. karen moves to her mother, sits next to her on the swing. barb leans against a fence post, ivy hangs back.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i get embarrassed just thinking about it. karen takes a tube of hand creme from her purse.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh... nothing to be embarrassed about. secret crushes, secret schemes. province of teenage girls. i can't imagine anything more delicate, or bittersweet. some part of you girls i always identified with... no matter how old you get, a woman's hard pressed to throw off that part of herself.}
<P>__{(to karen, re: hand creme)}
<D>__{that smells good.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it's apple. you want some?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yes, please. violet puts out her cigarette. karen passes her the creme.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{i ever tell you the story of raymond qualls? not much story to it. boy i had a crush on when i was thirteen or so. rough looking boy, beat up levis, messy hair. terrible underbite.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{but he had these beautiful cowboy boots, shiny chocolate leather. he was so proud of those boots, you could tell, way he'd strut around, all arms and elbows, puffed up and cocksure. i decided i needed to get a girly pair of those same boots and i convinced myself he'd ask me to go steady. he'd see me in those boots and say "now there's the gal for me." violet lights another cigarette.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{found the boots in a window downtown and just went crazy: praying for those boots, rehearsing the conversation i'd have with raymond when he saw me in my boots. must've asked my momma a hundred times if i could get those boots. "what do you want for christmas, vi?" "momma, i will give all of it up just for those boots." bargaining, you know? she started dropping hints about a package under the tree she had wrapped up, about the size of a boot box, nice wrapping paper. "now, vi, don't you cheat and look in there before christmas morning." little smile on her face. christmas morning, i was up like a shot, boy, under the tree, tearing open that box. there was a pair of boots, all right... men's work boots, holes in the toes, chewed up laces, caked in mud and dog shit. lord, my momma laughed for days. silence.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{please don't tell me that's the end of the story.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh, no. that's the end. ivy shakes her head, goes inside. she's had enough of violet to last a lifetime.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you never got the boots? "august" 11 09 12 pink draft}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{no, huh uh.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{okay, well, that's the worst story i ever heard. that makes me wish for a heartwarming claw hammer story.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{my momma was a nasty mean old lady. i suppose that's where i get it from. an awkward moment.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're not nasty mean. you're our mother and we love you.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{thank you, sweetheart. karen leans her head against her mother's shoulder, takes her mother's hand. off barbara, watching this }
