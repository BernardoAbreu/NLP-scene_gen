<C>__{dan}
<D>__{as warm as i can.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i can't feel my legs anymore. is that bad? i mean, it doesn't hurt as much...but that's bad right?}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior chair lift continuous}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{no, no. you'll be alright.}
<P>__{(quietly to parker)}
<D>__{that's probably really bad. i gotta move, so i need you to }
<A>__{he looks closely at parker's face. the tip of her nose and the tops of her cheeks look as if there is black soot on them.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{hey...go like this.}
<A>__{he motions wiping his face. parker follows suit, but winces in pain.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{ow! it feels like...like sunburn.}
<A>__{pieces of her chapped skin are stuck to her icy glove.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i'm not an expert but i think that's frost bite.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{look at me is my face changing color anywhere?}
<A>__{parker looks as closely as she can.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i don't..i can't see anything. i don't know, it's too dark}
<A>__{she starts rubbing at her cheek again.}
<C>__{lynch}
<B>__{e}
<D>__{no! stop touching it. don't touch it.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{but it itches now...}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i know but if you keep touching your face it's gonna rub off.}
<A>__{parker is terrified.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{just try and cover your face. try and stay warm.}
<A>__{staying warm is absolutely impossible. parker hides her exposed hand deeper inside her wet jacket. icicles dangle from the bottom of the chair and their clothing.}
<C>__{dan }
<P>__{(winded)}
<D>__{you gotta move faster up there.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i'm trying man, i'm trying.}
<A>__{lynch slowly lifts himself up onto the back of the chair, which bends at an awkward angle. from above him we can see the long drop down, and as he slowly starts to maneuver his body up to the top of the chair arm the height looks `stomach droppingly' scary.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{careful.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{stop talking.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{lynch. i think the }
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{dan, stop talking.}
<A>__{silence. lynch gets his gloved hands around the top of the cable. it is frozen over with a thick layer of ice.}
<B>__{e}
<A>__{the distance to the next chair seems about 10 times as far now.}
<C>__{lynch }
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{i can do this. if jenny bluth could climb the rope, i can totally do this.}
<A>__{slowly, he wraps his arms around the wire, now with his full body weight on the back of the chair. the bolt holding the arm into place on the cabling starts to creak. it bends slightly, but seems to hold firm.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{ok. ok. ok.}
<A>__{he starts to pull himself up onto the cable.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{don't look down.}
<A>__{with one hand in front of the other, lynch hoists himself about two feet off of the chair and into the air.}
<C>__{lynch}
<P>__{(gritted teeth)}
<D>__{slippery.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{do you got it?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{shh.}
<A>__{he slides out a little bit more, his feet dangling high above the ground. the cable clangs somewhere to the front and back of lynch. the noise is almost refreshing in the silent ice covered wilderness. with another deep breath, lynch moves another two feet out over the sky. he is straining hard. another two feet out. he looks down for the first time. he sees something that scares the shit out of him.}
<C>__{lynch }
<B>__{e}
<D>__{oh god.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{please no. please no...}
<A>__{he starts to pull himself back to the chair, quickly.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{come on, lynch! you had it!}
<A>__{lynch gets his foot on the icy chair back and tries to balance his weight on it. swish! his foot slips off of it and he almost falls...but parker grabs onto his coat.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i got you.}
<A>__{lynch scrambles into the chair and huddles next to parker.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{he looks at her, icy tears in his eyes. his face is white.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{finally lynch grabs her face in his hands. he gets close to her.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{don't look down.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{he grabs her head forcefully, trying to cover her ears.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{don't look down there, parker.}
<A>__{the camera booms up and above them. as it tilts down at them...we reveal dan splayed out on the ground below. out of the darkness of the bushes...a pack of six wolves slowly and silently descends on him from all angles.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{lynch? what's wro }
