<A>__{the patrolman holds up his hand.}
<C>__{patrolman}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{hold it there!}
<A>__{mary slams down on the brake, tries to pull herself together. the patrolman raps again, less gently. reluctantly, mary rolls down the window. the patrolman studies her for a moment.}
<C>__{patrolman}
<D>__{in quite a hurry.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(because he seems to}
<D>__{be awaiting an}
<P>__{explanation)}
<D>__{i didn't mean to sleep so long. i was afraid i'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so i decided to pull over...}
<C>__{patrolman}
<D>__{you slept here all night?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(a faint edge of defensiveness)}
<D>__{yes. as i said, i couldn't keep my eyes...}
<C>__{patrolman}
<P>__{(mere concern)}
<D>__{there are plenty of motels in this area. you should have... i mean, just to be safe...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i didn't intend to sleep all night! i just pulled over... have i broken any laws?}
<C>__{patrolman}
<D>__{no, m'am.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{then i'm free to go...?}
<C>__{patrolman}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{is anything wrong?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{of course not! am i acting as if... something's wrong?}
<C>__{patrolman}
<P>__{(almost a smile)}
<D>__{frankly, yes.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{please... i'd like to go...}
<C>__{patrolman}
<D>__{is there?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{is there what?}
<P>__{(not waiting for an answer)}
<D>__{i've told you there's nothing wrong... except that i'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...}
<C>__{patrolman}
<P>__{(interrupting, sternly)}
<D>__{now wait just a moment! turn your motor off, please.}
<A>__{mary seems about to object, thinks better of it, turns off the ignition.}
<C>__{patrolman}
<D>__{in the course of my duty, i never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! believe that, m'am.}
<P>__{(a little softer)}
<D>__{now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. but when you act as if i've just placed you under arrest...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{patrolman}
<D>__{no need to apologize...}
<A>__{mary starts the car, her face turned as if she wishes the matter were all settled and the patrolman had already gone. the patrolman isn't exactly one of those civil servants who demands a thank you, but he does feel her manner is a bit too abrupt. he calls:}
<C>__{patrolman}
<D>__{wait a minute!}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(jamming down the brake)}
<D>__{now what?}
<A>__{the patrolman gazes at her a moment, then:}
<C>__{patrolman}
<D>__{may i see your license?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{patrolman}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{mary pulls her handbag up from the floor, where she'd placed it when she stretched out for sleep. she puts her hand in it, rummages for her wallet, cannot find it. the patrolman is staring at her. she glances at him nervously, pokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, realizes she'll have to remove some of its contents. nervously, badly controlling her fear, she takes out the money filled envelope, and then the important papers envelope, filled then a couple of other items, places them on the seat, finally finds her wallet, opens it, hands it to him. he looks at the wallet, then at the car.}
