<A>__{marion patiently sits rocking. one of the dogs has its head in his lap and marion scratches it behind the ears.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior cornwallis' headquarters day}
<A>__{a stone faced marion stands in the center of the room, playing with the dogs. one of the dogs jumps up, putting its front legs on marion's shoulders, and licks his face. just then, cornwallis walks in, overjoyed to see his dogs.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{jupiter! mars!}
<A>__{the dogs just look at cornwallis. he holds out his arms, waiting for them to rush to him. they look up at marion who nods to them.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{go.}
<A>__{the dogs run to cornwallis and nuzzle him in a friendly but not enthusiastic manner. cornwallis pats them vigorously, too vigorously for the moderate level of joy the dogs are showing at their reunion.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{my boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed. thank you for that, colonel.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{my pleasure, sir.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{please forgive me for keeping you waiting.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{apology accepted.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{thank you, colonel... i'm afraid i don't know your name.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{colonel will do.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{as you wish.}
<A>__{tarleton enters with four dragoons, all armed... marion freezes... marion and tarleton lock eyes. marion searches for some sign that tarleton recognizes him. there's none.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{colonel... colonel banastre tarleton.}
<A>__{tarleton nods.}
<C>__{tarleton}
<D>__{colonel.}
<A>__{marion, like ice, looks tarleton up and down. then he slowly turns and looks at the four dragoons, two on either side of tarleton. marion measures the odds and finds them wanting. with a supreme effort of will, marion forces himself to turn from tarleton to cornwallis and the matter at hand.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{shall we proceed?}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{let us. unless you object, i would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. perhaps i could explain them to you...}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i served in his majesty's army in the french and indian war.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{oh. very well, then. would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.}
<A>__{cornwallis is surprised. he exchanges a look with tarleton.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{you are familiar with how these things are done. in fact, i would like to claim aggrieved status.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{very well, proceed, sir.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{first, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non military nature which i would like to have returned to me.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i will do so as soon as possible.}
<A>__{cornwallis is surprised.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{apology accepted. now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{that one is a bit more difficult.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{and what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un led armies having at each other. there must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{that is a separate issue.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i consider them linked.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{i beg to differ. one is a command decision on your part. the other represents nothing more than the occasional over exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{as long as your soldiers attack civilians, i will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and my men are excellent marksmen.}
<A>__{cornwallis sighs.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{very well, let us move on to...}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{prisoner exchange.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you have eighteen of my men. i want them back.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{i do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but i hold no prisoners of war.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{if that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. nineteen, if you hang me with my men.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{what officers?}
<A>__{marion steps to the window, checks the view. a wooded hillside is visible in the distance. marion reaches into his jacket... the dragoons move on him... marion extracts not a weapon, but a spyglass, which he hands to cornwallis.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{in the clearing, just down from the crest, to the left of the dark pines...}
<A>__{cornwallis looks through the spyglass.}
<B>__{view through the spyglass}
<A>__{though difficult to see clearly through the shimmering haze, cornwallis can just make out a row of bound redcoat officers, with patriot soldiers holding muskets at their heads. cornwallis turns coldly to marion.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{their names, ranks and posts?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{they refused to give me their names. their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow. their posts? we picked them up here and there last night.}
<A>__{cornwallis glares at marion.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{you are not a gentleman.}
<A>__{marion can't help but laugh at the insult.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{if your conduct is the measure of a gentleman, i take that as a compliment.}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{get my men.}
<A>__{cornwallis turns to colonel huntington.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{arrange the exchange.}
<A>__{colonel huntington leaves to do so.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{thank you, general. i'm sure your officers will thank you, as well.}
<A>__{marion salutes cornwallis who doesn't return the salute. then marion turns to tarleton. he walks up to him and looks him in the eye.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you don't remember me, do you?}
<A>__{tarleton examines marion's face, finding him familiar, but unable to place him... then tarleton remembers...}
<C>__{tarleton}
<D>__{ah, yes, that boy.}
<A>__{tarleton calmly holds marion's glare.}
<C>__{tarleton}
<D>__{ugly business, doing one's duty.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{yes, ugly business.}
<A>__{marion takes a step closer to tarleton, then speaks very softly, very slowly, very clearly.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{if you are alive when this war is over, i'm going to kill you.}
<A>__{marion locks his eyes on tarleton to make it perfectly clear that he means what he says. tarleton tries to cover his reaction but it's apparent that he's taken aback by marion's icy words. marion turns and walks out. the two great danes start to follow, but cornwallis snaps a command:}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{jupiter! mars!}
<A>__{the dogs freeze, looking after marion, who doesn't turn back. the dogs reluctantly sidle over to cornwallis' side.}
