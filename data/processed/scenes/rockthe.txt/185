<A>__{goodspeed stares blankly into space. intercut : between the two cells again.}
<C>__{goodspeed}
<D>__{jesus.}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{why didn't you just tell hoover and the bureau where the microfilm was? make a trade?}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{some trade. they'd get the microfilm and i'd get a bullet in the head.}
<C>__{goodspeed}
<D>__{i see your pointerior something's been on my mind. about your escape.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{mason rises. lifts the bed. pulls off the bed's heavy rolling caster. knots the caster onto one end of the braided rope.}
<C>__{goodspeed}
<D>__{you went down the shower drain, through the tunnels to the power plant, under the steam engine and out through the intake pipe that much i've got ' but... howld you get out of your cell?}
<A>__{mason leans out his cell and tosses the rolling caster down the cell block. the braided rope, tied to it, plays out to it's full length.}
<C>__{goodspeed}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{i only ask because, in our current situation, it might be useful information ...}
<A>__{the result: the braided rope lies across the cell block floor, the rolling caster tied to it. mason holds the other end of the rope through the bars of his cell.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{trade secret, billy, i will tell you this: it was easier than getting in.}
<B>__{mason}
<A>__{fiercely yanks the rope toward him. the heavy rolling caster jerks from the floor. the caster, pulling the rope, flies past mason's cell shooting in an arc around the corner of the cell block, still pulling the rope, where the caster pulled rope catches the cell release lever against the wall. the rope coils, wrap wrap whap, around the release lever handle.}
<B>__{mason}
<A>__{tugs the rope taut like he's just snagged a fish. then he pulls slowly and delicately. the cell door release lever pulls down and mason's cell door (and all the doors on that tier) open at once. and}

<A>__{smiles.}
