<A>__{camera follows tom towards his bedroom passing the others. perhaps we see frank sprawled out asleep already in his underwear. we might see the twins in their bunks. one of the twins' lower torso is laying outside of the blanket. he casually flips the blanket over the kid's bare feet and continues to his room.}

<A>__{tom enters and closes the door. turns on a stereo which plays a cello piece by yo yo ma. books fills his room. he sits at his desk, puts on eye glasses and looks through some paperwork. suddenly he stops, looking over the paperwork, into space. a thought passes by. we don't know what.}
