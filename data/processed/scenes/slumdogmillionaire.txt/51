<L>__{interior `tent'. day.}
<A>__{under sheets of plastic propped up on sticks, jamal and salim are sleeping out the hottest part of the day. jamal wakes to see a figure standing over him a silhouette with a halo of sun behind him. out of his bag, the man produces a bottle of thumbs up. he uncaps it with an alluring hiss. it is almost an advert for thirst quenching affluence. almost instinctively, salim and jamal stir.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{he hands the bottle to salim, gets another from his bag and waves it questioningly at jamal.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{hot, huh? my name is maman.}
