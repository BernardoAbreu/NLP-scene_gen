<A>__{ted, the bellboy, meets his first guest of the evening, as a taxi unloads her luggage. to his warm surprise, the guest is a beautiful mediterranean goddess (actually, we will come to see she is not technically a goddess, but a high priestess). she is about 25 years old, speaks with an italian accent and is dressed in gypsy garb. she is athena. ted takes athena's luggage onto his cart. but one item in a woven moroccan bag proves to be unbearably heavy. athena is concerned as he attempts to lift it.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{pleeze be careful my god. you have no idea...}
<A>__{ted strains as he uses all his cojones to lift the insanely heavy bag onto the cart. athena tips the cab driver, stingily. the driver winces and gets in the cab. ted has now managed with grunts and groans and strained blood vessels to put this thing on the cart. the cab skids away. athena looks at ted, who is out of breath.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{i'm usually a good tipper, but this one this cab driver he had green all around him. i don't like that in a man.}
<A>__{ted wheezes and pounds on his chest.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{green? is that bad? like you read auras or something like that?}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah, well what color are you seein' around me... how's the tip lookin?}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{i see purple... in your face, and...}
<A>__{as if she can't help herself, athena's eyes are strangely drawn to his crotch. she frowns, confused by this impulse. ted appears to be charmingly oblivious. athena looks back into his face.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{...you're okay.}
<A>__{ted touches his face as if searching for the "purple" in it and moves the cart inside, discreetly checking out his crotch and giving her a confused side glance.}
