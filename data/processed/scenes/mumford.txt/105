<L>__{exterior lily's cafe, main street day}
<A>__{mumford crosses the street from his office. a huge bus with "applejack tours" on the sides, is disgorging its passengers, a large group of elderly japanese women, all of whom file neatly into lily's cafe. lily stands on the sidewalk outside greeting them merrily.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what's the deal?}
<A>__{lily continues her welcomes, but points out a hand lettered sign in her front window "closed for lunch. see you tomorrow."}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{they come through a few times each year.}
<P>__{(greeting one cheerily)}
<D>__{hello, mrs. saito, good to see you again!}
<P>__{(back to mumford)}
<D>__{it's a tour.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{where am i supposed to eat?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{you're on your own today, honey.}
<A>__{mumford's attention is suddenly drawn to something across the street. he glances thoughtfully at lily for a moment, then back out there. what he sees: skip is once again zipping down the street on his skateboard in the midst of traffic. he has not noticed mumford.}
<C>__{mumford }
<D>__{hey, skip!}
<A>__{skip looks over, then immediately changes course toward them, barely checking the surrounding traffic. he is extraordinarily skillful. when he gets to the curb, he pulls a snazzy board flipping maneuver to dismount and come up on the sidewalk. some of the japanese matrons react with delight.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{doc.}
<A>__{skip notices the tour members filing by, but is immediately distracted by the presence of lily, who's a little excited to meet the local celebrity.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{lily, i want you to meet skip. skip, lily.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{it's a pleasure to meet you.}
<C>__{skip}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{yeah... me you, too... i was at your house...}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{upstairs, with doc... yeah, it's very nice... i heard your shower.}
<A>__{skip can't believe what he just said. neither can the other two, actually. mumford can't stop himself from laughing, but he cuts it off fast. lily blushes, but skip's agitation has charmed her. something's happening here.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{i've seen you going by on your board, but i didn't realize you're so young... to be so...}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{...so rich?}
<C>__{lily}
<P>__{(gives him a look)}
<D>__{...so accomplished.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i may be young, but doc can tell you, i'm very immature.}
<A>__{he's making a joke and it represents quite a recovery. they're all relieved. then there's an awkward silence. skip watches the last of the tour enter the restaurant.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{so, is this like a japanese restaurant?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{i'd better get in there.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{that's a lot of people all at once.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{it's okay. they pre order. there's a choice of three entrees.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{what are they?}
<A>__{lily gives him a careful look: is he really interested? there's something about him...}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{salad nicoise? i love salad nicoise.}
<C>__{lily}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{well, come on in.}
<A>__{she motions him in and starts to follow. mumford makes a "what about me?" sound. lily, grinning, just points to the sign and leaves mumford standing on the sidewalk.}
<C>__{delbanco }
<D>__{dr. mumford.}
<A>__{mumford turns to find dr. delbanco and phyllis sheeler, the shrinks lionel had conferred with, standing nearby. it takes a moment for mumford to remember delbanco. finally, shaking hands }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{dr. delbanco. it's nice to see you again.}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{i don't think you know dr. sheeler. she's the other therapist here in town.}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(shaking her hand)}
<D>__{of course... i've heard great things about you.}
<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{you never got back to me.}
<P>__{(mumford doesn't understand)}
<D>__{...i called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... kind of a professional welcome.}
<A>__{mumford makes a show of remembering.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{forgive me, please. what a gracious thought. we must do that.}
<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{why don't i call you when i've got my calendar in front of me?}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{what are you doing for lunch?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{right now?}
<A>__{the other two nod in unison. mumford considers, trapped.}
