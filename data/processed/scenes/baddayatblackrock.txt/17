<L>__{exterior liz's garage full shot}
<A>__{the garage, without a door, opens on the street. against the front of the building is parked a battered bicycle. on one of the barnlike walls a boy of nine is drawing laboriously with a piece of chalk. he puts the last flourish to a skull and crossbones identical with that seen earlier on the window of the equipment yard office. macreedy stops a few feet from him, waiting until the boy prints "t.j.". as he steps back to admire his handiwork...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{hi, t.j.}
<A>__{t.j. nods. he approaches the wall, raising his chalk.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{this your garage?}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{where's the man it belongs to?}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{ain't a man.}
<A>__{he pauses. as macreedy opens his mouth to interrogate further...}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{lady runs this garage.}
<A>__{again a pause. t.j. has just completed the final letter of the word "hates". and again as macreedy opens his mouth...}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{she's not here.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{where'd she go?}
<C>__{t.j.}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{i dunno. somewhere.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{when will she be back?}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{i dunno. sometime.}
<A>__{again the pause. t.j. steps back, having completed his work, which, of course, broadcasts the fact that "t.j. hates j.s.". and again as macreedy begins to speak...}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{in about ten minutes.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(with a grin)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{t.j. turns, pulls the bike away from the building, completes a fastidious "pony express" and peddles furiously out of scene.}
