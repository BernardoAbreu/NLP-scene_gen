<A>__{frank stops his nondescript chevy across the quiet street from the closed, unmanned gate at the bottom of the marron driveway. frank's pov as he looks over the gate, the wall, the heavy vegetation and the rising grounds beyond. (note: the use of the term frank's pov, is not to be taken simply as a camera direction. rather, it re presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in the special way frank sees. frank lives by constant vigilance, heightened awareness. it is his genius and his burden. the audience must be put in the position of looking, searching, scanning with him.) he has a curious sense of being watched, a kind of prick ling on the back of his neck. as he looks around, a black toyota 4x4, parked some way down the road, drives rapidly off too fast to get a clear look. he watches it go. frank pulls up to the gate and gets out of his car. he grabs a bar of the gate and pulls. the whole gate rattles. frank gets back in his car and pushes a button on the intercom box at the side of the gate. a man's voice crackles out of the box. transmission is terrible.}
