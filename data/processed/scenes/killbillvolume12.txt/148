<A>__{elle crawls from the wreckage of the trans am, holding the hanzo sword, looking like she's just been in a car wreck. a cut on her head makes blood run down the side of her face. luckily for her, not the side with the good eye. the camper door swings open. the bride emerges from budd's home, looking like a barbie doll that's been dug up after ten years buried in the backyard, carrying a hanzo sword. every footfall creating a cloud of dust. the two women, each carrying a samurai sword, face each other in showdown position. a shark smile spreads across elle's face.}

<A>__{ex cu's of: their separate grips on the sword's handle. their feet moving closer. the bride's eye. elle's eye. the tips of each other's blade. their blonde hair. as the operatic spaghetti western music builds to a crescendo...we cut back and forth : between cu's of the two women that get tighter and tighter as we zoom in closer and closer....until...we reach the theme's climax.... both women let loose with a samurai grunt and swing. ex cu: two silver blades clash. ex cu: blonde hair whipping. ex cu: two silver blades clash again. two shot: the two women warriors stand their ground, striking and defending...when they stop, no one's been touched. the two women swords in attack position stare across to the other one, as they prepare for their next attack... now they begin to circle again. cu their feet making a circular walk. they attack... ex cu blades meet however this time we don't know who's on the left or the right. one blade maneuvers around the other. ex ex cu: of tip of blade slicing open skin, about a quarter of an inch. it looks like a scalpel cut. no blood. just skin separating. we don't know who's cut. the two women stand and face each other. neither knows if it's them who has been struck. neither woman bleeds. we feel a count of...one mississippi... ex cu: one silver blade, clean as a whistle. ex cu: one silver blade with a smudge of crimson blood on its}
