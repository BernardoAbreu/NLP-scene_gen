<A>__{molly and oda mae are climbing the fire escape.}
<L>__{interior loft night}
<A>__{carl runs to the fire escape window. he looks out just in time to see oda mae go into the 7th story window.}
<L>__{interior new loft night}
<A>__{molly and oda mae run through a new loft that is under construction. it is a maze of tangled wires and broken walls. the fire escape window slams shut and nearly scares them half to death. they rush blindly toward the front door. it won't open.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{back to the fire escape. head for the roof.}
<A>__{oda mae reaches the fire escape window just as carl appears on the other side. she screams. carl tries shoving the window open. it won't budge. molly sees some scaffolding leading to the skylight. there is an opening at the top.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{this way!}
<A>__{molly quickly climbs the scaffolding and makes it to the roof. with a huge shove, carl opens the window and rushes inside. the window slams behind him. oda mae rushes back toward molly, but her foot catches on a loose cable and she falls to the ground.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{help us, sam!}
<B>__{oda mae}
<A>__{a hand falls on oda mae's shoulder. she spins around. carl is standing behind her. she screams as he knocks her to the floor.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i want the check. just give me the check.}
<A>__{molly looks down from the scaffolding and begins to scream.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{god almighty, carl! what are you doing? what have you done!?}
<A>__{she descends quickly and runs toward carl.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{don't interfere! she's a thief. it's not her money.}
<A>__{carl kicks oda mae. molly rushes at him, attacking him violently. carl aims his gun at her.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{keep out of this, molly!}
<A>__{he grabs oda mae by the hair.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{where is it?}
<A>__{oda mae cries out.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{in my purse.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{over there.}
<A>__{she points across the room. carl sees the purse and yanks oda mae toward it. yanking it off the floor, he tears through it like a wild man. there is no check. he grabs oda mae.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{where is it, goddamn it? where is it?}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{i gave it away.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you're lying! don't lie to me!}
<A>__{he aims his gun at her eye and is about to fire when, suddenly, something shoves him to the floor. carl screams and jumps back, tripping over oda mae. sam is standing there. in total panic, carl scrambles to get up. horrified, he shoots his gun blindly into the air. molly and oda mae dive for cover. the bullets have no impact. sam musters all his strength and shoves carl again. white with fear, carl grabs molly and aims his gun at her head.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i will kill her. you touch me and i will kill her. i mean it, sam. just give me the check.}
<A>__{the gun is cocked at her temple. no one moves. slowly the camera dollies toward carl.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sam, please. i didn't mean for him to kill you. it's not my fault. come on, sam, give me the check. give it to me and i will leave her alone.}
<A>__{nothing happens. carl looks nervous.}
<B>__{angle}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{sam? sam?}
<A>__{in a wild explosive fury, sam charges at carl and smashes at his gun. the weapon flies out of carl's hand. empowered by an anger we have not seen before, sam smashes into carl with a violent force. carl's body careens into walls and floorboards. wiring snaps. two by fours crack. carl, crawling desperately to escape, sees his gun on the floor. with a wild rush, he grabs for it and shoots at the door. the lock explodes and the door flies open. carl tries to run for it, but sam cuts in front of him. with growing power, sam sends carl flying back into the apartment, colliding into a tall scaffold. bags of plaster topple to the ground as mounds of plaster dust hurl into the air. the apartment looks like a scene from another world. carl, in a state of total unrelieved panic, breaks away from sam. the dust obscures his escape. like a trapped insect, he scrambles furiously to the fire escape window. sam cannot see him. carl shoves at the window. it is stuck. with a supreme effort, he grabs a ripped bag of plaster and swings it at the glass. half of its plaster spews across the room before smashing the window. shards of glass fly in all directions. sam turns and sees carl. he surges after him, but knows he cannot get to him in time. carl is halfway out the window when sam's fist slams into an electrical box attached to a dangling bx cable. it goes flying toward the window. to his amazement, it hits the frame. a huge pane of glass dislodges and comes crashing down. carl looks up just in time to see the pointed edge aiming for his chest. before he can move, it pierces him between the ribs and slices into his heart. his body quivers. carl's eyes bulge from their sockets. his body begins to spasm. he can't get up. a look of abject terror flashes through his eyes. he tries to scream. there is no sound. he tries to breathe. there is no breath.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{with one last effort, carl lurches forward. to his amazement, his body stands up and pulls away from the window. he looks down at his chest and is amazed to see that the glass is gone. there is no blood. excited and confused, he turns around and sees sam. for a moment, he cannot comprehend what is happening.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{sam?}
<A>__{there is a strange, silent moment between them. then, seemingly out of nowhere, a terrible clicking sound is heard. frightening black forms are emerging from the darkness. carl looks behind him and gasps. past the figures coming toward him, he sees his own dead body. it is pinned to the window sill. before carl can cry out, the dark figures swoop down and envelope him. in a flash, his spirit is caught and surges with the dark forces back into the shadows. far in some invisible distance, we can barely hear him scream. and then it is silent. it is over.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{molly is crouched in the corner, her back pressed tightly against the wall. she is staring into space. the room is filled with plaster dust. slowly, emerging from the dust, we see sam approaching molly. he gazes at her with terrible longing. suddenly, a brilliant light glows from behind the ceiling and the skylight floods the room with a golden haze. sam turns to look at it. his eyes are full of surprise and wonder. the spirits beyond the ceiling are beckoning to him. as he looks down, he notices that his hands are growing transparent. his body is beginning to fade. a faint smile forms on his face. he leans down toward molly, staring at her for a long, silent moment.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{goodbye, moll.}
<A>__{molly's head lifts up. she looks around.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{sam? is that you?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{molly?!}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i hear you, sam.}
<A>__{she starts to cry. gradually, we notice that the dust in the air near molly is beginning to shimmer with a subtle glow. to her astonishment, sam's spirit is reflected in the floating particles.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{oh god!}
<A>__{sam's luminous form appears before her. molly is overwhelmed by the sight of him. the two of them gaze at one another without moving. they know it is for the last time. it is a silent exchange, charged with emotion. slowly, the two bodies reach forward. as their lips touch, the plaster dust swirls sensuously through sam's vaporous image and he begins to disappear. molly pulls back from him as though from a cloud. his voice rises from the mist.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i can't stay anymore.}
<A>__{tears roll down her cheek. the brilliant light intensifies. it is beautiful, like a sunrise, saturating the room with a warm, comforting glow. molly looks up and sees it all. oda mae sees it, too.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{they're waiting for you, sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i know. goodbye, oda mae.}
<P>__{(with deep felt gratitude)}
<D>__{thank you. your mama would be proud.}
<A>__{oda mae smiles warmly. sam turns to molly. she is gazing at the last remaining moments of him. her eyes brim over with tears and love.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i love you, molly. i've always loved you.}
<A>__{molly swallows hard and wipes her eyes.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{ditto.}
<A>__{the light inside sam intensifies. a sweet smile emerges on his lips.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's so amazing, moll...}
<A>__{his face fills with joy.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the love inside.}
<A>__{he whispers, almost crying.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you take it with you.}
<A>__{they are his last words. his spirit dissolves within its ghostly moorings and begins to evaporate. molly looks up silently for a moment, her face filled with love.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{see ya.}
<A>__{we see sam's spirit rise from the room. it passes effortlessly through the ceiling and, in seconds, he is gone. the room grows dark. molly sits quietly on the floor. there is a look of awe and wonder in her eyes. after a moment, oda mae reaches down to help her up. molly looks at her lovingly and then gently takes her hand. arm in arm, supporting one another, they walk quietly from the room.}
