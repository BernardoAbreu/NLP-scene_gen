<L>__{exterior lambert home night}
<A>__{renai sits on the front steps, alone. it is late. she looks somehow tired and wired at the same time. smoking a cigarette. josh pulls in. fumbles out of his car, tipsy.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{what are you doing up?}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{it's midnight, josh.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{when did you start smoking?}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{you've been coming home late every single night. you've never had to do that in all of the years you've been at the school. now all of a sudden you have to stay back late?}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{i don't like it either, but i'm grading tests. what choice do i have? we've gotta pay dalton's bills.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{your mother is paying dalton's bills, josh. i know because she reminds me every chance she gets.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{jesus, i can't win with you. that's my son in there too, not just yours!}
<A>__{he paces, the anger sobering him.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{i've always felt like less than good enough for you. i feel it every time you mention our bills. that subtle voice that says `can't you get a job that pays more than a teacher'? and now i can't even look at you without feeling it.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{you're projecting that onto me. you've written an entire story about i'm how i'm feeling without once asking me how i'm feeling.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{i don't need to ask. i know you.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{i am losing my mind here in this house, josh. i'm scared and i need you and you're not here. where are you?}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{i told you, i'm grading tests.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{i don't mean that. i mean you're not here. with me. in this situation. you're avoiding it, like you do anything stressful, whether it's this or a parking ticket.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{christ, i should have stayed at the school.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{there you go again.}
<A>__{renai stands up and walks inside the house. the door closes.}
