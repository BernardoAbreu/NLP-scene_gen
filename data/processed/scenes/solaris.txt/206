<A>__{still turning, slowly. but something about its appearance is different.}
<L>__{interior prometheus}
<A>__{complete chaos. kelvin is chasing sartorius to the flight deck.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<P>__{(yelling as he runs)}
<D>__{it's changing characteristics. it's solidifying taking on weight.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{how quickly?}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{if it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.}
<L>__{interior flight deck}
<A>__{kelvin and sartorius get the ship ready for take off.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{where's snow? did you call him?}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{kelvin turns and sees one of the video monitors that snow is sitting in his room.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<P>__{(via intercom)}
<D>__{snow! we need you up here.}
<A>__{snow doesn't reply.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{snow!}
<A>__{snow looks up. there's a strange look on his face.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{what's wrong with you? we need your help.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{i won't be making the trip.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{snow, get up here, now.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{i'm not snow.}
<A>__{this stops kelvin and sartorius. they look at each other and then at the monitor.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{i got rid of him. i wanted to see if... i wanted to be the only one. i wanted to be snow.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{fuck me. i knew it.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{when did this happen?}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{oh, right away. that's why you never saw me with anyone. you should've noticed that. i miss him, though. i think i made a mistake.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{jesus...}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{but i can't leave with you. i won't make it.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{maybe you can.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{you want it coming back with us?}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{you go ahead. of what i remember about earth... it's all one thing now. everything's a blur. i like distinctions.}
<A>__{snow lies down on his bed. kelvin looks at sartorius.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{we do not have time to deal with this. get the diode sail into position and let me know when the bias drive and the induction ring are at zero pointerior}
<A>__{kelvin nods and obeys. he then takes one last look at the monitor to see snow lying in bed. kelvin reaches over and shuts the monitor off.}
