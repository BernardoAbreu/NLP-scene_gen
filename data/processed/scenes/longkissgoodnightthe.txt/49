<L>__{exterior the white house establishing night}
<A>__{yes, it certainly is. cut to:}
<L>__{interior situation briefing room same time}
<A>__{three stories below the white house proper. the president is seated in his robe and slippers. before him sits a panel of three: national security adviser; deputy director of the cia; and another man in his sixties, sporting a distinguished mane of silver hair. the president addresses him:}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{mister perkins.}
<P>__{(frowns)}
<D>__{please, say it again, i'm a little slow. better yet, i will try it. you lost an operative, a trained counterassassin, and you just saw her on tv in a christmas parade.}
<A>__{the silver haired man appears unperturbed. and no, by the way, it didn't escape us that he shares his surname with caitlin's teddy bear, the one mom named he nods, says:}
<D>__{silver haired man on tv, that's correct. it's two weeks old, intelligence just caught it.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{you recruited this woman in the late seventies? silver haired man for chapter, yes. i was a friend of her father's, you see, and... i took her in.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{well, it looks like she returned the favor, now doesn't it?}
<P>__{(throws up his hands)}
<D>__{unbelievable. you people, you dump this on me, then next week you're screaming, "where's our funding?" shit. i will tell you where it is, can you say health care?}
<A>__{the head of the cia pipes up:}
<C>__{cia director}
<D>__{mr. president, please calm down. the cia bears no responsibility for this problem.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{thanks for sharing, kent. how many double agents you got on the payroll, last count...?}
<C>__{cia director}
<D>__{sir! that controversy has been thoroughly dealt with, and if there still exists a leak, perhaps this... woman agent of his silver haired man if i may, sir, colonel baltimore hasn't had classified access since}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but thank you, kent, for trying to fuck me in the ass.}
<A>__{he directs his baleful gaze at the president. lights a pipe.}
<D>__{silver haired man i'm afraid rooting out double agents may have to wait. the primary threat is the woman. her specialty is counterassassination, a horseshit turn of phrase which implies the other fellow shot first, but in point of fact she's a takeout artist of the first order. nearly disposed of our friend the beard down in cuba a few years back. specializes in long rifles, accurate to a mile and a half. presumed dead; now, after eight years, back in the field, agenda unknown. she knows enough to hurt us. i'm frightened. understand?}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{yes, yes. i believe you. just one question:}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what in pluperfect hell is she doing in a christmas parade???}
