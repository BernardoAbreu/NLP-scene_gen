<L>__{interior vicki's car late afternoon}
<A>__{vicki drives. walter stares out the passenger window. the sun is low on the horizon. walter wears a pressed button down shirt. he is clean shaven and his hair neatly combed. his hand fidgets in his lap.}

<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yeah.}

<A>__{vicki reaches for his hand, then something catches her eye.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{hey, look.}
<A>__{walter follows her gaze.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{starlings.}
<A>__{on the horizon, a flock of starlings whirl and turn as if one huge body, a dancing cloud against the sky.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i heard they were filthy birds.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{not when they fly.}
<A>__{vicki looks at him and smiles. there is a long beat as they drive. i e. vicki's car, reservoir day vicki sits in her car smoking. she stubs out her cigarette. the ashtray is full. she looks out the window. vicki's pov: walter and a woman stand in the distance near the water. the woman looks a few years younger than walter. there is space between them. walter faces her, but she looks out at the water. after a long moment, he reaches to touch her arm. the woman pulls away and yells something at him. walter's head drops. vicki lights another cigarette. she flips on the radio to country music, blocking out all sound. she looks back out the window. the woman yells angrily then falls quiet staring at walter. after a long moment, she turns and walks back up the hill to her car where carlos waits, leaning against the car. annette gets in the car, slamming the door. carlos pauses, looking at walter, then gets in the car and turns on the engine to leave. walter stays standing near the water.}
