<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{the window opening onto the light well is open. a pigeon has landed on the window ledge. it walks to and fro, then finally dares to jump down inside, onto the floor. it starts to explore the surroundings. we hear the toilet flush. georges comes out of the toilet. the door opening frightens the pigeon. alarmed, flapping its wings, it flutters about the room. after a moment of surprise, georges tries to shoo it back toward the window. but the bird escapes in the opposite direction. george follows it. he closes the doors of the other rooms. coming from the bedroom, we faintly hear anne's voice. georges fetches a towel from the bathroom. he chases the bird. he hits out at the bird for so long that it escapes back out through the window. georges, visibly exhausted, has to sit down on the chest in the hallway.}
