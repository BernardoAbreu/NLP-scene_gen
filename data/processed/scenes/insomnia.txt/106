<L>__{exterior gendreau glacier day}
<A>__{gendreau glacier. spilling down between two huge mountains. enormous in its whiteness, its coldness, its silent power. will and walter walk up its face, away from the other tourists. walter leads the way. hands in his pockets.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you know this glacier moves a quarter of an inch every day?}
<A>__{he points off to the horizon.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{and on a clear day you can see all the way over to newtok. there's a beautiful aviary over there. we can go sometime.}
<A>__{will's lip curls. watching him.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{it's actually cool for this time of year. normally the temperature runs about...}
<A>__{suddenly will lunges at him. walter's eyes widen in surprise as he grabs him up by the collar. nose to nose. will barely keeping control.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you think this is a nice meeting we're having here? friendly? two people getting acquainted?}
<P>__{(jerks him harder)}
<D>__{you sick, coward, fuck. i get up every morning of my life just to bring someone like you down. beating a seventeen year old girl to death. washing her afterwards, cleaning her. make you feel like a real man?}
<P>__{(tightens his grip)}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{walter flounders.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{i outta end this right now. take a rock and smash your fucking skull in...}
<A>__{his jaws tense, nostrils flare. walter, red faced, sputtering...}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i stood right behind you...i saw you look right into his eyes and shoot him...}
<A>__{will clenches his teeth.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{...seattle's great hero. shooting his own partner. i saw it all...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that was an accident! you hear me? i didn't know it was him!}
<P>__{(shakes him hard)}
<D>__{i didn't know it was him!}
<A>__{just then a shriek. will looks over a couple kids. further down the glacier. having a snowball fight. will looks back at walter. has to take it easy. shoves him away in disgust. walter falls down onto the snow. dislodges his hearing aid. watches will pace. head throbbing. ribs, screaming in pain.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{then why lie about it?}
<A>__{walter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid. puts it back around his ear.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{i mean, i'm all for bending the truth. that's what i do in my novels. it's my trade you might say. but why cover it up?}
<A>__{gets up. brushes the snow from his butt. checks something in his pocket.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{you don't have to tell me if you don't want to. i'm sure you have some reason. something noble. i have faith in that.}
<A>__{looks down at the kids. shakes his head.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{they should be bundled up better.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what's your game, byrd?}
<A>__{walter turns back to him.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no game.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{the phone call. the knapsack.}
<A>__{walter shrugs.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i figured we're partners on this one. i mean, after what i saw...}
<A>__{will stops short. eyes burning. it's all he can do not to throttle this weed.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{let's get one thing straight, byrd. we are partners on nothing.}
<A>__{walter looks at him. scratches his head.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i research my novels. i know the procedures. you'd have cuffed me back at the ferry. you'd have called for back up, read me my rights, and gotten a search warrant for my apartment. you're a well respected detective. there's no reason for you to be talking to me right now...}
<A>__{he takes out a handkerchief. blows his nose.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{...except that we could help each other.}
<A>__{will stares at him.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{so. we're at an impasse.}
<A>__{will runs his hands through his hair. half crazed. heart pounding. turns to watch... the kids down the glacier. making angels in the snow. their giggles carried along by the wind. will, squeezes his eyes shut. trapped. about to defy every instinct in his body.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{you're going to get a phone call.}
<A>__{walter steps up, tapping his hearing aid.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i said you're going to get a phone call.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(perks up)}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{kay connell had a signed copy of one of your books.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{thought you might find that.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you're going to be brought in for questioning.}
<A>__{walter smiles. pleased.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{down at the station?}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(hisses)}
<D>__{yes down at the station.}
<A>__{walter rubs his hands together. thinking.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{okay. okay. brought in for questioning. good. i can write this.}
<A>__{just then the ferry blows its horn. low and loud. walter looks down at it.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{ferry's leaving.}
<A>__{he starts down. will watches him pass, has no choice but to follow. walter, going over the details in his head.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{something to divert...}
<A>__{snaps his fingers. an idea.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{my gun. you still have my gun, right?}
<A>__{will nods. walter smiles. spreads out his hands.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{then that's the wild card. every detective story has a wild card.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what do you mean, "wild card?"}
<A>__{tourists. boarding the ferry.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{next ferry's in forty five minutes.}
<A>__{walter heads over to the ramp. will stops, grabbing his side. a pang through his ribs. excruciating. calls out to walter.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what do you mean "wild card?"}
<A>__{walter looks back. waves.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you'll know. at the questioning.}
<A>__{gives his ticket to the ticket taker. gets on. walks back to the stern. looks out at will. the horn sounds again. walter, at the rail. smiles. the ferry's engine, churning up water. starting forward just as... walter takes a mini cassette recorder from his pocket. holds it up for will to see. will, on shore, sees it. a cold flash ripping through his body. that motherfucker. bolts through some tourists towards the ramp but... a couple of guys are just pulling it in. the ticket taker, grabs his arm.}
<C>__{ticket taker}
<P>__{(to will)}
<D>__{full up.}
<A>__{will, jerks his arm away. stares off at the ferry. walter byrd and his tape recorder. receding into the distance.}
