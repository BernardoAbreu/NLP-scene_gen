<L>__{exterior south beach day}
<A>__{two 14 year olds alone on a beach. digging for clams in the mud.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i had kissed her once, when we were ten. looking at fish through a glass bottomed box. it was just an impulse, and no big deal.}
<A>__{ishmael pulls back from the deep hole, to make room for hatsue to reach down. we can see her fingers explore the shell of the dug in geoduck clam.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{he's still got a good grip. we need to dig more.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{at school, she kept mostly to the japanese kids, and sort of ignored me. as if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.}
<A>__{they are digging now, together. carefully.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i told myself that was good. that it made our friendship special. and didn't mean she was ashamed of it. necessarily.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{easy. slow is best.}
<A>__{gently, she begins to dislodge the clam from its lair.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i thought about her. sometimes, all the time. i knew i was unhappy. but i knew if i told her...}
<A>__{she lifts it clear. and as she admires its size and roughness with her fingertips. as she washes it in the shallows. he watches her movements.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{it might be a mistake. i could never correct.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i like you.}
<A>__{the words make her turn. not startled, exactly. alerted. but neutral, without affect.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{do you know what i mean, hatsue? i've always liked you.}
<A>__{there is no answer. he leans slightly closer, and she looks down. this is the moment. afraid and driven, he moves slowly to her face. and puts his mouth against hers. she lets him and, encouraged, he pushes harder, making hatsue... ...lose her balance, and planting a hand beneath the water to support herself, eyes closed too tightly, she kisses ishmael for a long moment, before... ...leaping up, snatching her clam pail and running away down the beach like a deer. he stands slowly. to watch her go.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i knew in my heart that we would love each other forever.}
<A>__{his face is slack and unsmiling, but he is helpless with happiness. contemplating this truth.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{the way she kissed me. she knew it, too.}
