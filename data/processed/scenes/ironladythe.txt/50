<L>__{interior car. street. central london. 1974. dawn}
<A>__{...carol and margaret seated, driving steadily along a deserted street. margaret thoughtful as the radio plays.}
<C>__{voice on the radio}
<D>__{it's 1974 and you'd think it was wwii. blackouts, no petrol. it's a mess. heath should resign now and make way for someone who's not afraid to tackle the unions.}
<A>__{carol's nervous prattle begins to break through.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i swear, it's all gone completely out of my head. my driving instructor thinks i should pass but i feel as if i've hardly had any lessons. ridiculous isn't it? maybe third time lucky.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{right. the only thing you should remember is that everyone else is either reckless or inept. and often both.}
<A>__{margaret eyes the road, gesturing carol to move forward.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{one must be brave if one is to take the wheel }
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{right o.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{move over... move to your right a little bit...}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{but if i move to the right aren't i on the wrong side of the road?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{carol!}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{well he's in the way!}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{to the right. move to the right!}
<A>__{a yelp from carol as the car swerves a little, narrowly missing a lone cyclist }
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{so sorry! terribly sorry!}
<A>__{margaret throws a wave from the wound down window. the cyclist swerves on recognizing her, watching as the car goes round and round the square, almost balletic.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{hey, look at me, driving!}
<A>__{carol's squeals of delight, let loose on the open road. the tyres screech on the corner.}
