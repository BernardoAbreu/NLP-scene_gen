<D>__{i fuck you! i fuck you!}
<B>__{walter}
<A>__{hurls his leather satchel.}
<B>__{kieffer}
<A>__{watching dieter's charge, is caught off guard. the bowling ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet. he falls back, his uzi clattering away.}
<B>__{walter}
<A>__{twists away as dieter reaches him; grabs dieter's head in both hands; draws dieter's head up to his mouth, which closes on dieter's ear.}
<B>__{dude}
<A>__{he rushes franz but draws up short as franz sends out karate kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping. franz gives a loud cry with each kick; the dude leans back, throwing his arms up, evading the kicks.}
<B>__{walter}
<A>__{his jaw is still clamped on dieter's ear. dieter draws his saber against walter's side, drawing blood. walter doesn't react to the wound. growling as dieter screams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws clamped.}
<B>__{the saber}
<A>__{dieter drops it.}
<B>__{dude}
<A>__{awkwardly circling, evading franz's kicks.}
<B>__{walter}
<A>__{still worrying the ear. with a tearing sound his head and dieter's separate. dieter, earless, screams:}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{i fuck you! you cannot hurt me! i belief in nussing!}
<A>__{walter spits his ear into his face.}
<B>__{dude}
<A>__{the dude and franz, both now panting heavily, have yet to establish body contact. franz continues to kick.}
<C>__{franz}
<D>__{veakling!}
<B>__{walter}
<A>__{draws back his fist.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{nussing!}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{anti semite!}
<A>__{bam! a powerhouse blow to the middle of his face drops dieter for the count.}
<B>__{dude and franz}
<A>__{with a piercing shriek franz finally summons the nerve to charge the dude, hands raised to deliver karate blows. as he reaches the dude whhap the boom box swings into frame to smash him in the face. its volume shoots up. walter bashes him a few more times over the head. the music screeches to static, then quiet. laid out now, franz too is quiet. all quiet. walter, panting, looks around.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{we've got a man down, dude.}
<A>__{with a hand pressed to his bleeding side he trots over to donny, who lies gasping on the ground. the dude, also panting, rises and trots over.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{hy god! they shot him, walter!}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no dude.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{they shot donny!}
<A>__{donny gasps for air. his eyes, wide, go from the dude to walter. one hand still clutches his eighteen dollars.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{there weren't any shots.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{then what's...}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{it's a heart attack.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{wha.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{call the medics, dude.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{wha. . . donny }
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{hurry dude. i'd go but i'm pumping blood. might pass out.}
<A>__{the dude runs into the lanes. walter lays a reassuring hand on donny's shoulder.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{rest easy, good buddy, you're doing fine. we got help choppering in.}
