<A>__{inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his stomach. holding the wound with his left hand. rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving in to kill inigo.}
<C>__{rugen}
<D>__{you've got an overdeveloped sense of vengeance. it's going to get you into trouble some day.}
<A>__{inigo watches the count approach, and the count flicks his sword at inigo's heart, and there's not much inigo can do, just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six fingered sword and count rugen's blade sinks deeply into inigo's left shoulder. inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much worse.}
