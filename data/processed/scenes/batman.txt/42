<L>__{exterior coastline day}
<A>__{a cabin cruiser slices through the waves. in the distance, closer to the shore, we see a throng of sailboats.}
<L>__{exterior deck yacht day}
<A>__{bruce's forty foot cabin cruiser, aptly christened "die fleidermaus." bruce and vicki are on the deck, in chairs, soaking up sun, gazing off at the sailboats.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{do you sail?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{too much work. i'm not really the physical type. thank you, alfred.}
<A>__{alfred has just appeared from belowdecks with a tray of drinks for bruce and vicki. vicki watches as bruce reaches for his glass. his forearm looks like a thin layer of skin over braided telephone cables.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{you do a very convincing imitation.}
<P>__{(sipping her drink)}
<D>__{mm, this is tasty. what's yours?}
<A>__{he smiles, slides the drink over toward her, gestures for her to try a sip.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{... ginger ale?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{two drinks and i start swinging from the rooftops.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell me, vicki. there's something i'm very curious about. what took you down to corto maltese?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{... i guess i needed a change.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{you were one of the most successful magazine photographers in the city. everyone wanted you.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{have you ever been to corto maltese?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{not since the shooting started.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{we went there once when i was little. i played on the beach. and at nights they had a band i danced with my father on the hotel patio.}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{that was corto maltese. when the war broke out i had to go back. and i promised myself that this time... i wouldn't look away.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what did you see?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{... terror.}
<A>__{the conversation is getting rather intense at both ends. vicki seems to have hit some weird chord within bruce.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{there's terror everywhere. some types are just more familiar than others.}
<A>__{for a moment bruce seems to be drifting back into his familiar 'preoccupied' mode. vicki laughs apologetically.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean to i know it all seems a million miles away, out here on the water, with all this }
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{insulation?}
<A>__{vicki is momentarily stuck for a reply. in some way she can't quite grasp, he seems to be challenging her.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{bruce, really, when i say these things i don't mean to criticize you.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i think you see things very clearly.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i'm happy to talk about something else. i don't want to be depressing.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{do you assume that if i know you better i won't like you as much?}
<A>__{vicki starts laughing. bruce is a notorious womanizer, but if this is a come on, it's like no come on she's ever seen.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i'm sorry, bruce, i have to ask. are you like this with the other women you know? because i just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(taking her hand)}
<D>__{vicki, if i say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, i think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it. because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how i will mean it.}
<A>__{bingo. the guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's also rather touchingly, almost childishly, sincere. before she knows it, vicki finds herself melting.}
