<A>__{across the expanse of whiteness, a dark image appears on the long flat horizon. moving toward us. as a legend appears, to establish.}
<B>__{closer on a snow tractor}
<A>__{crawling across the harsh frozen land like a domed insect.}
<L>__{interior snow tractor}
<A>__{agent mulder sits behind the controls of the enclosed cabin, several days growth on his face. dressed in thick, bundled outerwear. he maneuvers the vehicle to a stop. reaching for a handheld gps monitor to check his position. catching his breath for a moment all movement is exertion in this climate. mulder stares hard out the front window, the wipers beating time, but there is nothing out there but whiteness. he wipes the fog from a side window with his gloved hand, seeing nothing but more whiteness. checking the gps device again, then reaching for the door latch.}
<B>__{resume wide exterior}
<A>__{agent mulder exits the vehicle, hopping down onto the snowscape crust. setting out on foot with the gps device held before him. in this forbidding environment he might as well be taking a space walk without the security of a lifeline. which is the impression we get as his tiny figure trudges across the ice, increasing the distance between himself and the snow tractor.}
<B>__{moving with mulder}
<A>__{up a gentle grade, the snow tractor now behind him. moving into tight f.g. where he stops, seeing something now which allows him to pocket the gps device. dropping instinctively to his knees, so as to avoid being seen by: mulder's pov in the distance is an ice station. a row of interconnecting white dome tents, whose design is now familiar to us. there are what look like snow tractors and other snow vehicles parked alongside the structures.}
<B>__{resume mulder}
<A>__{pulling a compact pair of binoculars from one of his deep jacket pockets. training them on: the ice station bino matte panning across the domes and vehicles, where there is no sign of personnel until mulder pans off the building, finding in his field glasses an approaching snow tractor. moving across the landscape toward the ice station. when it pulls to a stop, a man exits out of one of the domes: the cigarette smoking man. moving to the vehicle and getting in. the vehicle reverses now, transporting the csm back away from the ice station.}
<B>__{close on mulder}
<A>__{taking the field glasses away from his eyes. the excitement he feels expressed now in his breathing, which has become harder and shallower. mulder rises, beginning to move the still great distance between himself and the ice station.}
