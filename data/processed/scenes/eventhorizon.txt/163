<A>__{starck programs the sensor workstation. she glances over at weir: sitting at a computer terminal, his face rapt as data flashes by. his lips move, muttering to himself.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{why dr. weir, i think you're in love.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{hmmm. claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her. i told her that wasn't true, i just knew the event horizon better, that's all.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{claire is your wife?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{it must be hard, being so far away from her.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{yes. i miss her. she died. two years now.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{weir keeps his attention focused on the screen.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{these things happen.}
<P>__{(reacting to something on the screen)}
<D>__{wait a minute, that's not right...}
<A>__{he fingers fly across the keyboard, double checking the data. miller leans over weir's shoulder.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you have something, dr. weir?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{the date.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{the event horizon's computer think's it's 2034.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{it's 2041...}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{exactly. the ship's internal clock is off by seven years.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{maybe a power interruption crashed the system...}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{no, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. it's as if time just... stopped for seven years.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{explanation?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...}
<P>__{(he shakes his head)}
<D>__{the event horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like lazarus, returned from the dead.}
<A>__{the intercom interrupts them:}
<C>__{peters }
<P>__{(intercom)}
<D>__{captain miller, dr. weir? i found the final log entry.}
