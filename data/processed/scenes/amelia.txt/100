<A>__{amelia at a bank of microphones, smiling, modest, comfortable. george and fred stand back to one side. flashbulbs go crazy, newsreel cameras churn.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{did i pressure the navy to build a landing strip at howland island? how exactly would i do that? threaten not to enlist?}
<A>__{laughter in the room. more flashes.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{the airstrip has been planned for a long time. i was thrilled to learn it will be ready in time for my flight. the navy has been wonderful, as always. reporter #1 amelia, what do you say to the charges that your husband is pulling the strings, pressuring you into this around the world flight to make a financial killing?}
<A>__{george bolts forward to the microphones, looks at his wife with astonishment...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{wait a minute, you're flying around the world? don't you know a woman's place is in the home??}
<A>__{the press roars with laughter.}
<D>__{reporter #2 george, why don't you go along this time? watch over the little woman.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i begged to go. but it seems that between 185 pounds of husband and 185 pounds of fuel, i lost out.}
<A>__{gazes at his wife.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{at least, i think that's what all the laughter meant.}
<A>__{he gives her a kiss. thirty flashes record it. as he steps back...}
<D>__{reporter #3 experts are saying that this ‘flying laboratory’ is a sham. there's nothing to be learned for aviation, and you're just in this for the money.}
<A>__{the place gets really quiet.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{who am i to argue with ‘experts?’ i will just give you my plain old common sense thinking on this...}
<A>__{pens come up, cameras jockey for position. this is what they're waiting for. she holds up one finger. first...}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{we may not learn much about the plane, but we will about the pilot. endurance over a month's journey, flying nearly every day. response to stress, crises. i think that will make a contribution.}
<A>__{holds up a second finger. two...}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{i'm a working stiff like all of you. i don't apologize for the fact that i need money to live. and to keep financing my flying, which is what i love. i think that's a positive example for women.}
<A>__{third finger. three...}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{i'm not doing this as a scientist. i'm a flyer, boys, pursuing my passion. for the fun of it. the fun of it. something i recommend as a healthy motive for women.}
<A>__{a wink. a shrug...}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{...and maybe even some men.}
