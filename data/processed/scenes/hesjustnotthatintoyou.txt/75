<L>__{interior home depot day}
<A>__{close on: two seemingly identical planks of wood. we pull back to reveal ben and janine, in the wide aisle of home depot, as janine really studies the two pieces of wood. finally, she points to one of them.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{that one.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no. that's the laminate.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{that one isn't real hardwood floor?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no. but it looks exactly the same at like one one hundredth of the cost.}
<A>__{janine considers this.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i still wanna go with the real wood.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{but you can't even tell the difference.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{that's not the pointerior}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{then what's the point?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i just don't like the way it's pretending to be wood. if you're not wood, then don't try to look like wood.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i don't think it's pretending }
<A>__{ben is making light. but janine is all business.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{it's a lie. just be up front tell people what you really are.}
<A>__{ben takes this in. his cheeks start to burn.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you're right. i'm sorry. you're totally right.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{it's ok. maybe we should look at the grills and come back.}
<A>__{as she starts to steer their giant cart away, ben just stands there, fused to the ground. finally:}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i slept with someone.}
<A>__{janine stops, doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{i }
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i heard you.}
<A>__{she doesn't turn to face him. total silence.}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{you tell me this in home depot because you know how i hate a public scene.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that is not why i }
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i knew it. i knew it. you asshole.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{and it's you that's been smoking, too, isn't it?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what? why does that matter?}
<A>__{janine turns to ben. she is irate.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{have you been smoking?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no. no. i haven't.}
<A>__{janine just stares at him, fuming.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{look, i talked to neil, and he said i could stay on his boat for a while if }
<A>__{now janine's eyes go wide with disbelief.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{excuse me? and now you want to move out? you're like what leaving me?}
<A>__{ben looks confused, but is trying to roll with it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no. no. i just assumed that you wouldn't want me to }
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{we're not going to deal with this? we're not going to figure out a way to work through this?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i just assumed that once i told you, you would want me out.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{is that what you want?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(almost a whisper)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{she heads down the aisle with the cart. ben follows, confused that didn't go how he thought it would.}
