<A>__{director locke waits. messner and the swede appear in the doorway. the swede nods to all concerned and starts toward israel. doc gill acknowledges the swede.}
<C>__{dr. gill}
<D>__{dr. ingstrom, he's had a mild cardiac episode and recurring arrhythmia, i've given him 60cc's of nobuneatol...}
<A>__{the swede kneels down next to israel, dropping his black valise, cracking it open. messner, dazed, dumbfounded, sees locke.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{...deputy director locke?}
<A>__{locke approaches, lays a comforting arm on messner, guiding him to a chair.}
<C>__{locke}
<D>__{here. sit. please.}
<C>__{messner}
<P>__{(pointing to swede)}
<D>__{this is him? the hitman hired to kill israel? he's a doctor?}
<C>__{locke}
<D>__{difficult to explain everything now...}
<P>__{(beat, toward israel)}
<D>__{and much larger issues loom.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry about carruthers...damndest thing to have to die for.}
<A>__{the swede, working on israel, shaking his head, something's wrong. he stands, crosses to locke, silently confers.}
<C>__{locke }
<P>__{(to the swede)}
<D>__{very well.}
<P>__{(to other agents)}
<D>__{take mr. israel to the roof, he'll be traveling with us.}
<A>__{suddenly, soot breaks from his captors, sprinting for the shattered penthouse windows, launching himself a swan dive out into the open air he hangs there for a moment, an aesthetically striking form; like lazarus cast against a cobalt blue sky, backlit by the sun from the lake below till gravity grabs, pulls plummeting him toward earth, sending him headlong into the vast expanse of concrete below. this startlingly event is dismissed by mutual shrugs and a collective lack of concern. messner is absolutely agog.}
<C>__{messner}
<P>__{(to locke, forceful)}
<D>__{what the hell what is this!? people died. agent carruthers is dead!}
<C>__{locke}
<D>__{we have to transport mr. israel to las vegas, time is of the essence. the gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at tahoe international. i'm sorry, i'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. return to washington. you'll be debriefed in the coming days.}
<A>__{locke says no more starts out of the penthouse with the swede, dr. gill and buddy israel in tow. a bureau forensics team arrives to quietly tag and bag the dead...messner stands there, absolutely agog.}
