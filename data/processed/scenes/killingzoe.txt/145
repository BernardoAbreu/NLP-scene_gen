<A>__{they rush out toward the stairs.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{did you see how she ran? did you see how she ran? she doesn't care about you. fucking pussy only cares about pussy. look out for number one. what do you say zed?}
<A>__{he swipes again.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i will kill you. and once i kill you zed, i will get out of here. i will fuck your bitch up the ass and give her aids...if she doesn't already have it. what do you say to that zed?}
<A>__{he swipes and zed grabs a hold of the knife by the blade. eric pulls it free and the knife falls to the floor. zed takes this opportunity and kicks eric in the face. eric reaches for the knife. zed, his hand bloody, dives onto eric. zoey also jumps onto them and starts yanking on eric's hair. she plunges her nails into his face.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{fucking bitch!}
<A>__{zed is rabbit punching eric from underneath. then, eric grabs a hold of zed's balls and squeezes. zed lets out a shrill scream. eric starts elbowing zoey in the face. the three of them lay there on the floor wriggling like worms, unable to move because each is putting the other through such agony. then, oliver, shot up and bloody haplessly stumbles into the room. his body is a mass of bullet wounds.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{ox! where is thy yoke!?}
<A>__{he clumsily falls dead to the ground, his shotgun slides near zoey, zed, and eric. the sight of the gun gives eric the strength only a madman could posses. he rolls over and throws zoey off him. then, he smashes his forehead into zed's nose, bursting it. eric, deftly, rolls over and grabs the gun. he gets to his feet and cocks the pump action.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{fuck both of you.}
<A>__{then he notices the lack of gunfire upstairs. eric turns back to them.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{au revoir.}
<A>__{he aims to kill zed.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{then, all of the french policemen, decked out in their assault gear and wearing gas masks, storm down the stairs. at the sight of eric about to execute zed they raise their guns.}
<D>__{french policeman #1 [stop!]}
<A>__{eric stops. it becomes quiet. then, eric looks back down at zed and braces for the shotgun kick.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i give you little kiss. ciao.}
<A>__{he squeezes the trigger and...}
<B>__{click}
<A>__{the police open fire with their french made assault machine guns and fill eric with bullets. instead of falling he does a scarecrow dance as his body is painted red. the wall behind them explodes as plaster sprays all over zed. an image overcomes eric. eric's dead body slumps to it's knees and flops on top of zed. zed pushes the body off and tries to drag himself to zoey. zoey runs up to him and holds him. the police all charge into the secondary vault area and secure the downstairs. zoey is crying as she holds zed. the police have their guns aimed at the two of them. zoey looks up.}
<C>__{zoey}
<P>__{(to the policemen)}
<D>__{[i work here. this man is a customer...he needs medical help.]}
<A>__{they take their guns away and kneel next to him, seeing if he's okay.}
<D>__{french policeman #2 [how bad do you think his wounds are?]}
<A>__{the other policeman, unable to tell because of eric's blood, simply shakes his head.}
<D>__{french policeman #1}
<P>__{(to zoey)}
<D>__{[are you alright?]}
<A>__{zoey starts to cry.}
