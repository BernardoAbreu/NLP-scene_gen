<L>__{interior weston house, living room afternoon}
<D>__{ivy finds little charles watching television.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{is the coast clear?}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{never very. ivy waits until karen passes through, heads upstairs.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{what are you watching?}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{television.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{can i watch it with you?}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{i wish you would. she sits beside him on the couch.}
<C>__{little charles }
<D>__{i almost blew it last night.}
<P>__{(she nods)}
<D>__{are you mad at me?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{nope. they hold hands.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{i was trying to be brave.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{i just... i want everyone to know that i got what i always wanted. and that means... i'm not a loser.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{hey. hey. he turns to look at her.}
<C>__{ivy }
<D>__{you're my hero. he considers this... then breaks into a huge smile, mutes the tv, goes to the ancient, oak, electric piano, turns it on.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{come on, help me push the pedal. she joins him on the piano bench.}
<C>__{little charles }
<D>__{i wrote this for you. he plays, and quietly sings a gentle but quirky love song. it's charming, touching. she smiles, he smiles back. midway through, mattie fae enters, watches for a moment. then breaks the spell.}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{liberace. get yourself together, we have to get home and take care of those damn dogs. they've probably eaten the drapes by now. charlie comes down the stairs with their overnight bag.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm sure the house is fine.}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<P>__{(notices the tv)}
<D>__{oh, look, honey, little charles has got the tv on.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{no, i was just }
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{this one watches so much television, it's rotted his brain.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{i'm sure that's not true.}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{what was it i caught you watching the other day?}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{i don't remember.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{mattie fae }
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{you do so remember, some dumb talk show about people swapping wives.}
<C>__{little charles}
<D>__{i don't remember.}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{you don't remember.}
<P>__{(to ivy)}
<D>__{too bad there isn't a job where they pay you to sit around watching tv.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{c'mon, mattie fae }
<C>__{mattie fae}
<P>__{(still to ivy)}
<D>__{y'know he got fired from a shoe store?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{mattie fae, we're gonna get in the car and go home and if you say one more mean thing to that boy i'm going to kick your fat irish ass onto the highway. you hear me?}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{what the hell did you say ?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you kids go outside, would you please? ivy and little charles go.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i don't understand this meanness. i look at you and your sister and the way you talk to people and i don't understand it. i can't understand why folks can't be respectful of one another. i don't think there's any excuse for it. my family didn't treat each other that way.}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{maybe that's because your family }
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you had better not say anything about my family right now. i mean it. we buried a man yesterday i loved very much. and whatever faults he may have had, he was a good, kind, decent person. and to hear you tear into your own son not even a day later dishonors beverly's memory. we've been married thirty eight years. i wouldn't trade them for anything. but if you can't find a generous place in your heart for your own son, we're not going to make it to thirty nine. he goes. she takes a moment to collect herself, turns to follow, finds barbara standing out in the open kitchen door. there's an awkward moment.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i didn't mean to eavesdrop. i froze.}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{that's you have a cigarette, hon?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{no, i quit years ago.}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{so did i. just sounded good to me. i thought at dinner... at that horrible dinner last night, seemed like, something might be going on between ivy and little charles. do you know if that's true?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{oh, this is...i'm not sure what to...}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{look, just. is it true?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{yes. it's true.}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{okay. that can't happen.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{this is going to be difficult, uh... ivy and little charles have always marched to their own... and i'd expect this to be toughest on you }
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{barb...?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{they're in love. or they think they are. what's the difference, right?}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{honey }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i know it's unorthodox for cousins to get together, at least these days }
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{they're not cousins.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{ but believe it or not, it's not as uncommon as you might }
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{listen to me. they're not cousins.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{beg pardon?}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{little charles is not your cousin. he's your brother. he's your blood brother. he is not your cousin. he is your blood brother. half brother. he's your father's child. which means that he is ivy's brother. do you see? little charles and ivy are brother and sister. karen and steve enter from outside.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{go away.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{we're just going to }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{go away! now! go away! karen and steve retreat. barbara stares at mattie fae.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{you and dad.}
<P>__{(mattie fae nods)}
<D>__{who knows this?}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{i do. and you do.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{uncle charlie doesn't suspect?}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{we've never discussed it.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{we've never discussed it. okay?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{did dad know?}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{yes. y'know, i'm not proud of this.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{really. you people amaze me. what, were you drunk? was this just some }
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{i wasn't drunk, no. maybe it's hard for you to believe, looking at me, knowing me the way you do, all these years. i know to you, i'm just your old fat aunt mattie fae. i'm more than that, sweetheart, there's more to me than that. i don't know why little charles is such a disappointment to me. maybe he, well, i don't know why. i'm disappointed for him, more than anything. i made a mistake, a long time ago. okay? i paid for it. but the mistake ends here.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{if ivy found out, it would destroy her.}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{i'm sure as hell not gonna tell her. you have to find a way to stop it. you have to put a stop to it.}
