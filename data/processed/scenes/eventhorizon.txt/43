<C>__{weir}
<D>__{we haven't been able to confirm any live contact, but tdrss did receive a single transmission from the event horizon.}
<A>__{weir punches a button on a console. the transmission blares from the bridge's speakers, static and noise and, underneath all, inhuman voices. the crew listen, look at one another. the recording ends abruptly.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{what the hell is that?}
<C>__{peters}
<D>__{it doesn't sound like anything human.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{houston has passed the recording through several filters and isolated what appears to be a human voice.}
<A>__{he activates a different file. the resulting wail is more human but no less terrifying, a cry of despair. the last message from a drowning man...}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{jesus...}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{it sounds like latin.}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{latin? who the fuck speaks latin?}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{no one. it's a dead language.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{mostly dead.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what does it say?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...}
<A>__{weir plays the hellish incantation for a third time.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{there: "...liberatis me..." they haven't been able to translate the rest, it's too distorted.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{"liberatis me." "save me."}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{from what?}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(to weir)}
<D>__{you're convinced the crew could still be alive? after seven years?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{the event horizon only had life support for eighteen months. it seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... i have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you heard the tape, smith. we're looking for survivors.}
