<L>__{interior italian restaurant night}
<A>__{the italian restaurant host, 50's, jolly with a thick accent, greets conners and dekker.}
<C>__{italian host}
<D>__{detective, where you been? much too long. sit, sit. i give you best table in house. it'll just be the two?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{no, four. more are coming.}
<C>__{italian host}
<D>__{wonderful, wonderful. who's this young man?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{for all intents and purposes... he's big brother.}
<C>__{italian host}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{he's your brother?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{italian host}
<D>__{no matter, no matter... i bring you bottle of house wine!}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{we're still on duty. no wine.}
<C>__{italian host}
<P>__{(insulted)}
<D>__{no wine?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{a little wine.}
<C>__{italian host}
<D>__{that's better.}
<A>__{they get to the table, conners looks at it.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{last time i was here, you said that table in the corner was the "best in the house."}
<C>__{italian host}
<D>__{it was. anywhere you sit becomes best table in house. now relax, i bring you food.}
<A>__{later, still at the restaurant a piano player recreates the sweet sounds of italy. patrons sing along. eating, drinking and being merry. at the detective's table vincent and teddy have joined conners and dekker. a mountain of food still remains. a couple bottles of wine have been consumed, empty plates and basket rolls spread about. the mood is happy, light. not thinking about their day. conners tells an anecdote, something that teddy and vincent have heard before, but don't care. dekker watches the detectives, admires in their closeness.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{shane, what was that thing you said back at the house about "returning to the beginning path" or something?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{it's a buddhist story.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{we're all ears.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{one day the buddha found his heart in turmoil. so he retreats to the forest, to the earth, to the base of a great tree and, i'm paraphrasing, but... this elephant comes up and tells buddha he doesn't like seeing him discouraged.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{he can talk to an elephant?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{he's the buddha. he's attained the 6th level of consciousness. he's capable of communicating with plants, trees... even rocks.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{rocks?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{you asked.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{continue.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{the buddha was troubled so he went back to where he came from, the beginning, to find the path, the answer. so when you hit a dead end, go back to the beginning to find your way. or something like that.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{we have a genuine philosopher in our midst.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you're a buddhist?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{no. just something i picked up along the way.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{but you're religious?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{not particularly.}
<A>__{conners stares curiously at his new partner. then excuses himself to go to the men's room.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{you're all pretty tight.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{we've been through a lot together.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{i guess i just thought... i don't know. with all the trouble he's been in lately, coming back from suspension, everyone would treat him differently.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you can't believe what you read or see on tv. if anything, our tie to conners is stronger. he's one of the best. even when things got pretty wild today and everyone else panicked, he was in control. that doesn't just happen. he's just that good.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{teddy heads for the ladies room.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what was the buddha looking for?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{the divine in himself.}
<A>__{art's confused. dekker's cellphone rings.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{how long does it usually take to for fingerprints to be id'd?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{hours, maybe days. we could be waiting a while.}
<C>__{dekker}
<P>__{(answering)}
<D>__{dekker. okay.}
<P>__{(snapping the phone shut...)}
<D>__{they got a match.}
