We DIVE DOWN into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the   darker world of  the dead  surface of  Earth, the  desert of  the real.   The rotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere. We  approach a fissure in the Earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the   increasing buzz of multiple hovercraft  engines. Blue flashes grow  in  intensity from the fissure. Radio voices,  indistinct at first, grow louder   as we approach the fissure.}

A  tight convoy  of  three  HOVERCRAFT  explode  from  the  fissure,  traveling nearly straight up, like a   trio of massive locomotives flying   into the sky in tight formation,  linked together by tow cables.  The  blue glow has  been emanating  from  the  overworked flare  drives of   the first and third hovercrafts.  Between them, suspended by  tow  cables, is the dark, scorched,  and sliced NEBACHANEZZER. They  rocket upward, slowing as they reach the top of the arc.}

Helpless, the landscape speeds away  from them, while a wall of red-eyed SQUIDDIES speeds to them. It's been a mere TWO DAYS  since the realization of NEOS POWERS   and the defeat of AGENT SMITH. The slipstream whistles violently into  the interior  of the  ship, and  the crew  is cold,  tired, haggard,   and stressed beyond  belief as  they can  only watch  the action in  their knocked-out ship.}

The camera descends through the darkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset. The artwork terminates in the metal ring going  around her room. It's a much  more hospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. The  articles she's collected during  her time in  the resistance dot  the cabin. An unfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. There are charcoal portraits  of loved ones. Softly lit, the cabin sways slightly. The NEB is still in tow. NEO  is sitting against the wall on Trin's bed, with her curled up beside  him with her head on his lap. Neo cant sleep. He stares at the wall opposite him. There's a   photo of the crew of the NEB, sans Trin, in better days. Smiling,   laughing as they are  seated around the  table. Morpeus, Tank,  Dozer,  Switch, Epoch, Mouse. Neo stops on the image of a smiling CYPHER. There's   an unknown Asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely. Gently,  placing  Trinity's head  down,  NEO stands  and  examines the photo.}

The trucks are flanked by police cars. And if  one looks closely enough, they  can see a pair  of AGENTS standing to  the side. THE stunned soldiers have time to fire off a couple shots as they  run frantically to get  out of the  way of the  bike, 800 pounds  of metal flying at 150 miles per hour. GREGORY  plows  into the  sandbag  wall, directly  between  two parked trucks. The wall parts in  an explosion of sand and  sandbags. THEYRE THROUGH, but the bike scissors  uncontrollably, until it rolls and  we drop into bullet-time. AS the bike goes  over, we watch from  the side as GREGORY  dismounts, grabbing CHANDRA as he  steps over onto the  safe side of the  bike. A massive shower of sparks bursts and trails the bike. It tumbles like a bullet  falling  through syrup,  and  GREGORY keeps  walking  over the rotating surface, using  the bike to  protect him and  CHANDRA against the flesh-ripping concrete. THE bike is coming apart  as its bashed against the  concrete. Pieces rise slowly into the air -  the front wheel, the forks, the  mufflers, and a million flakes  of metal, until the  body bounces into the  air, carrying GREGORY  and CHANDRA  up. Holding  her to  him - shes barely conscious of the lightning-fast  crash, GREGORY rides the  flying body with one hand on the frame. It comes crashing down and back into  real time. THE  bikes body  streaks along  the highway.  The sparks  fade as  it slows, and pieces of metal come clanging and banging down around them. They  stop,  crouching  atop the  body,  with  GREGORY crouching  over CHANDRA. The disembodied front wheel rolls past them. STUNNED,  not quite  understanding how  or what  he just  did, he  and CHANDRA stand and start running. BEHIND  them is a blurry wall of  red and blue lights. POLICE SIRENS grow louder. THEY start running down the  highway, then GREGORY yanks CHANDRA  to a stop.}

GREGORY turns  and rushes  back to  her, even  as a  police cruiser is bearing down on them, its V-8 roaring and the siren IMPOSSIBLY LOUD. GREGORY drops  to her  side, only  to look  up into  the blinding high beams. He  drops over  CHANDRA, ducks  his head  and extends  his hand toward the oncoming cruiser and we drop back into BULLET TIME.

Choking, unable to breath with the rebar through him, he writhes. Theres nothing for him to grab to pull himself off the steel. His eyes clenched  shut, Gregor levitates,  by force of  will, pulling his body off the rebar.  The corrugated bars make wet,  sucking sounds as the pull through his body.  Finally, he gets to a twisted  piece of bar, and cant make it over. Hes losing all his breath, all his  life force, over one piece of twisted steel protruding from his chest. WITH one  last, wiggling  effort, he  works it  through him. HIS mouth opens wide, but no sounds emit, lest he recall Neo. Just as the end of the steel bar enters his body and we cant take any more,}

SMITH stares at the booth for a second. Emotion twists his face, first anger,  then  perhaps  sadness.  Hes lost.  Hell  be  in  the Matrix forever. With a quicksilver flash,  his body reverts back  to the shape of  the rookie cop. THE young  man is  left standing  there. He  is filthy,  bloody, badly sliced up, and the fingers of one hand are missing. He looks around at the carnage  as his  mouth simply  opens and  closes, reflexively,  in shock.
