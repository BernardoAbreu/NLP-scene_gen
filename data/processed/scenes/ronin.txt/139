<T>__{slam cut to:}
<L>__{exterior out on the river seine meanwhile}
<A>__{silence and fog. a river ferry does a slow ghostly glide down the river, and in seconds it approaches the riverside cafe, which appears through the mist, looked at by a sleek pair of sun glasses attached to a young punk in a leather coat, and the punk is looking at sam, vincent, and especially: deirdre. sam looks up and shouts a warning as the punk pulls a shotgun from beneath his leather coat, pumps the gun and screams out at deirdre with an irish accent }
<C>__{punk}
<D>__{this is for seamus!}
<A>__{boom! the punk pulls the trigger, a blast of fire as sam's gun is already out, two quick shots squeezed off and the punk is capped twice in the head, dead, sailing away on the ferry which never stops as the cafe goes wild, customers running, screaming, waiters dropping their trays. but sam doesn't run, and neither does vincent. sam stands, stunned by what he sees deirdre lies on the ground, hit full on in the chest: she's dead. a beat of pure silence broken by sirens in the distance, but quickly growing closer. now vincent looks at deirdre's corpse, then at sam, who is unable to move. for maybe the first time in his professional career, sam is staggered by the loss of a life. vincent gently takes sam's arm.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(soft yet urgent)}
<D>__{we have to go, sam, we can't be here.}
<A>__{sam looks at vincent, and for a moment sam struggles to find something to say, but he can't find a goddamned thing. the sirens are getting louder }
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(a little louder, bordering desperation)}
<D>__{let's go!!}
<A>__{vincent literally drags sam away and now the sirens have arrived, followed quickly by the gendarmes, who come running into the cafe but it's empty except for deirdre's body. now the street above the river sam and vincent are running through patchy fog, vincent leading the way, and now we're closer on vincent as he runs and runs and runs until he feels he's far enough away from the scene of the crime to relax. he collapses against a stone wall, chest heaving, shaking out two cigarettes, one for himself and one for sam.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(thrusting the cigarettes out to sam)}
<D>__{doctor's orders...}
<A>__{but sam isn't there to take the cigarette vincent looks around, trying to see what happened to his friend, but the fog has covered any sign of sam. vincent stands there, stunned, alone, the cigarettes in an outstretched hand that slowly falls back to vincent's side as he realizes that sam has left him on purpose. then vincent lights both cigarettes at the saem time and throws one of them over the stone wall the glowing cigarette arcs through the air until it lands in the river where it extinguishes with a hiss.}
<C>__{vincent }
<D>__{goodbye, sam...}
<A>__{back at the cafe the gendarmes have secured the scene (there isn't much to secure since everyone has run away). a majority of cops surround deirdre's dead body, but one gendarme wanders around the cafe, looking about, and then he sees something on the street above a shape in the fog. the wind blows and the fog clears for a second, and we see that it's sam. getting one last look at deirdre. quickly the gendarme points sam out but as he does the wind continues to blow and the fog swallows sam. seconds later the fog clears again, and when it does sam is gone.}
