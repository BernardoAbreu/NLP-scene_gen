<A>__{clyde watches as maintenance men remove the unbolted cot from the cell and his sleep matic is rolled in. convicts watch, dumbfounded. clyde's cellmate, a towering aryan brother named dwight dixon, stands quietly amazed...}

<A>__{back in the birdcage:}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i hacked the fedex database, diverted the package to me, made the switch, sent the package on. it's automated tracking numbers moving millions of packages daily. nobody's questioning who receives what, or why.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{and the prison phones?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{get a phone company uniform, hack the prison database, schedule an official visit. they'll wave you through the gate, like they did me. it's simple if you know how things work.}
<P>__{(off nick's look)}
<D>__{it's a system. you learn how it works. you play it. any system.}

<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(hesitates)}

<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i could tell. i love music. all of it. it's like air in my lungs. so the thing about clarence darby is, i want my record collection and player brought to me. the vinyl discs as well as cds.}
<A>__{reactions all around the room. iger leans forward:}
<C>__{iger}
<D>__{vinyl records and cds can be broken into shards. they make excellent weapons. my answer to that one, mr. clyde, is not no, but hell no.}
<A>__{clyde absorbs that, looks to nick, as:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's a legitimate concern.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(beat, calls to iger)}
<D>__{how about my ipod and speaker dock?}
