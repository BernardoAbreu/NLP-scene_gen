<L>__{interior spare room landing day}
<A>__{nadia is lying asleep on the bed in only her black underwear. we duck straight back out. john composes himself. he puts his head back round the door as if there's a real chance it will be shot off. she's facing away, arms folded, still holding the cigarette. it has burnt out, leaving a long curl of ash on her bare hip. he approaches the bed with immense trepidation, eases the cigarette from between her fingers and drops it in the bin. he stares at her bare hip, with the ash on it. holding the saucer under the ash, he blows on it gently. it takes three careful breaths before it drops in the saucer. unseen by john, her eyes are wide open as he steals out onto the landing. we stay with her a moment.}
