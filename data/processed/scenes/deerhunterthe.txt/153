<L>__{exterior ditch day}
<A>__{vince comes up ten feet from the bewildered deer. he raises his rifle, fires, and the barrel splits open. shots begin coming in, thudding in the mud and ricocheting off rocks. the deer wheels out on the highway. vince heaves his rifle at the deer, draws his pistol...}
<L>__{exterior highway day}
<A>__{cars are parked on both sides of the road. hunters are sitting in the cars, drinking, eating sandwiches and warming themselves at small fires. more hunters are up on the embankment.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{i got this one!!! this one's mine!!!}
<A>__{the panicked deer bolts down the highway between the parked cars. the hunters on the embankment open fire. the hunters in the cars dive for cover.}
<C>__{vince }
<D>__{hold your fire! i got this one!!!}
<A>__{vince fires, fires again. shots are ringing everywhere. hunters are shouting, running, yelling. a car window goes out, a headlight goes out. the deer is hit, falls and gets up. vince takes aim. a fleeing hunter bowls him over. the deer bolts for the woods, bullets smashing all around it. vince scrambles to his feet and plunges after it.}
