<L>__{interior new york times bullpen day}
<A>__{gordy talks to a latin reporter, ernie orosco.}
<C>__{orosco}
<D>__{you interested in the big picture or all the unpleasant details?}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{my family died because of what's going on down there. i want to know all i can.}
<A>__{orosco searches for a starting pointerior then }
<C>__{orosco}
<D>__{well, basically, the situation in colombia sucks...}
<A>__{as orosco continues... montage day night over the course of a week: gordy takes pictures, etc., off a wall in his home. he pins up photos of anne and matt at the top of the wall. beneath them he pins up a large map of colombia.}
<C>__{orosco }
<D>__{... the government's been fighting different marxists factions for over thirty five years. for most of that time, it was winning...}
<B>__{new york public library}
<A>__{at the new york public library, gordy uses microfilm files and computer access to the web to search out information on colombia and the wolf.}
<C>__{orosco }
<D>__{... suddenly the guerrillas began chopping 'em up. high tech weapons and equipment, well trained troops, aggressive hit and run tactics, all financed by extortion, kidnapping and collecting taxes from dope growers. it's big money, and they put it to use...}
<B>__{gordy}
<A>__{gordy pins up various colombia related articles and pictures on the wall, including the surveillance camera still of the wolf from the front page of the new york post.}
<C>__{orosco }
<D>__{... the government got scared. in 1998, to jump start peace talks, it gave a coalition of guerrilla groups temporary control over much of southern colombia... the first communist stronghold on an american continent...}
<B>__{gordy}
<A>__{gordy draws a line around the guerrilla zone.}
<C>__{orosco }
<D>__{... but there've been few talks and no peace. and the colombian military can't get near the guerrilla zone, especially around the town of caguan, where the e.l.c. kicks ass and takes no prisoners...}
<B>__{gordy}
<A>__{gordy circles and labels the elc controlled area.}
<C>__{orosco }
<D>__{... and that's where we come in. supposedly, to help eliminate narcos operating in the guerrilla zone. but some well informed people think that's just an excuse to hit the guerrillas themselves, since they're wrapped around the drug trade... we're there, we're involved... if we stay, the only real question is which vietnam war we're gonna have. the one some feel we could've won or the one we lost...}
<B>__{gordy}
<A>__{gordy watches a documentary about colombia which shows rebels, army troops, death squads, firefights, and with atrocities and bodies on both sides.}
<C>__{orosco }
<D>__{... bottom line? the place is as dangerous as a snakepit. you've got the different guerrilla groups, c.i.a., f.b.i., d.e.a., colombian military, u.s. military, right wing death squads and the only thing they've all managed to do is destroy a beautiful country and inflict suffering on the real people... hey, i'm colombian, and i will never go back...}
<A>__{off gordy's packed wall... same scene another day as gordy closes the front door, reveal mike, the firefighter, who's just come in and now stands staring at the wall, clearly whelmed by the level of compulsion this must have required.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{haven't heard from you in a couple days.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{been busy.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah. i can see that.}

<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{e.l.c. attack platoon... these assholes kill innocent people all the time in colombia.}
<A>__{gordy indicates a newspaper article.}

<D>__{a market. twenty seven dead.}
<P>__{(another)}
<D>__{a whole family... anne and matt didn't mean shit to them.}
<P>__{(indicates the wolf)}
<D>__{or him.}
<A>__{mike interrupts, trying to divert him to something else.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{hey, we never turned down free beer, and rookie's buying, you believe that? he certified today, he's off probation.}
<C>__{gordy}
<P>__{(still looking at wall)}
<D>__{ronnie couldn't find a fire with both hands.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{yeah. let's go tell him that.}
<A>__{gordy doesn't react. beat. more serious now }
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{c'mon, gordo.}
<A>__{gordy hears the tone. looks over and meets mike's eyes, seeing the genuine concern there.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we aren't gonna let 'em drink all the beer, are we?}
<A>__{off gordy...}
