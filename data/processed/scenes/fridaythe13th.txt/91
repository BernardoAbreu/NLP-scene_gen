<A>__{a long wide shot reveals the cool, clear lake during the lull of a hot afternoon. at the edge of the lake, in the shallows, are the members of the group: marcie, jack, ned, brenda, bill and alice. they are sitting or paddling or diving off the float. there is no real attempt to exert too much energy. gradually we become aware that this long wide shot is someone's pov. the camera moves from its stable position, now hand held, on a trajectory around the side of the lake, out of sight. branches, brush, and twigs are butted through. occasionally, we can see part of the prowler's arm fending off the underbrush.}
