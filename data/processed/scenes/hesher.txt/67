<A>__{hesher opens the van's back doors and grabs the container of gasoline. tj appears beside him, still panicked.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{hey, seriously. what are you doing?}
<A>__{hesher makes his way across the street toward the house and the yellow mustang. he pours gasoline all over the car. he does this with confidence he's clearly had some practice.}
<C>__{tj }
<P>__{(loud whisper too loud)}
<D>__{come on. this is insane. let's get out of here.}
<A>__{hesher ignores him and continues dousing the car with gas. the porch light comes on. someone peels open the front window curtains and looks out. tj and hesher drop to the ground behind the mustang. tj is terrified. he looks over to hesher who is smiling, in his element, this is the happiest we have seen him. the curtains close but the porch light stays on. unfazed, hesher hops back up and empties the gas can onto the mustang. hesher stands a moment, admiring the car, saying a silent goodbye to it perhaps, as he pulls a single bent cigarette from his pocket. he straightens it, then lights it with a match.}
<C>__{tj }
<P>__{(quietly frantic)}
<D>__{c'mon, man. let's just go.}
<A>__{hesher takes one long drag on the cigarette, then calmly flicks the still lit match onto the mustang. instantly, it erupts in flames. hesher picks up the gas can and walks calmly back to the van. tj follows still franticly looking back at the car and the house. hesher gets in the van and throws the gas can into the back. tj goes to the passenger door. it's locked. he wrestles the handle, panicking.}
<C>__{tj }
<D>__{open the door! it's locked!}
<A>__{hesher starts the van and pulls away, leaving tj stranded in the street. the front door of the house opens and a woman appears on the porch. discovering the car in flames, she screams. tj takes off, running across the street and through a neighbor's yard, down the side of the neighbor's house, with the woman on the porch screaming at him.}
