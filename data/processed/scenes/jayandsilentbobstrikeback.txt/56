<L>__{exterior provasik medical labs day}
<A>__{there are fire trucks all over the place now. the burned out van is being poured over by cops. just then, willenholly pulls up on a moped. he parks it and surveys the wreckage.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{my, oh my, oh my. who let the cats out?}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{wait is that right?}
<C>__{cop 1 }
<D>__{excuse me who the hell are you?}
<A>__{willenholly rips down the velcro patch on his jacket, revealing a badge.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{federal wildlife marshal. this investigation is now under my jurisdiction.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{oh really? and why is that?}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{because someone let a whole mess of animals out of their cages, sir.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{well, we believe that was just a diversionary tactic used to call attention away from the real heist over here at the diamond exchange.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{yeah, right. that's a believable scenario. it sounds more like something out of a bad movie.}
<A>__{willenholly and the cop look at the camera. then, another cop joins them.}
<C>__{cop 2}
<D>__{sir, the provasik people say they've rounded all their animals up, except for one: an orangutan.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{listen up, ladies and gentlemen! our fugitive has been on the run for 6 hours! average simian foot speed over uneven ground barring injuries or preoccupation with tire tubes, mites or bananas is four miles an hour. that gives us a radius of twenty miles.}
<C>__{cop 3}
<P>__{(calling out from crowd)}
<D>__{twenty four, sir!}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{cop 3}
<D>__{six hours times four miles an hour is twenty four.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<P>__{(doing the math in his head)}
<D>__{yes. yes, you're right. my bad. twenty four miles. now what i want out of all of you is a hard target search.}
<C>__{cop 4}
<D>__{excuse me, sir?}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{cop 4}
<D>__{what does that mean, exactly a "hard target search"? what's a "hard target"?}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{well. it's a target that's hard. anyway }
<C>__{cop 4}
<D>__{so are you referring to the search's level of difficulty? or is the hard target the monkey?}
<C>__{cop 3}
<D>__{or the people who stole the monkey?}
<A>__{the cops now chatter amongst themselves, to the effect of "yeah it could mean that too he's got a point ,"etc. willenholly rubs his temples.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{okay, how about this? what i want out of all of you is a thorough search of every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse, and doghouse in that area! checkpoints go up at fifteen miles!}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{wouldn't it make sense to put them up at every twenty four miles seeing as that's how far they'd have gotten in the last six hours?}
<A>__{they begin chattering amongst themselves again. willenholly looks at them all, defeated. he starts to cry.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{this is so frustrating. it's just so hard sometimes }
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{your fugitive's name is suzanne! go find her!}
<A>__{another cop joins willenholly, carrying a large, fat envelope.}
<C>__{cop 5}
<D>__{sir, this was just delivered to the station.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{cop 5}
<D>__{it's a tape from the terrorists who're claiming credit for the break in.}
<C>__{willenholly}
<D>__{is it vhs or beta? you know what never mind. do you have a vcr?}
