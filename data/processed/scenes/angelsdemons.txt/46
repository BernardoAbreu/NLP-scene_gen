<D>__{ confiscated from the netherlands by the vatican shortly after galileo's death. i've been petitioning to see it for almost ten years. ever since i realized what was in it.}

<D>__{what makes you so sure the segno is there?}

<P>__{(while searching)}
<D>__{the number 503. i kept seeing it over and over in llluminati letters, scribbled in the margins, or sometimes just signed that way, "503." it's a numerical clue, but to what? five, of course, is the sacred llluminati number the pentagram, pythagoras, a dozen other examples in science but why three?}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{it made no sense. and then i thought what if it were a roman numeral?}

<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{diagramma.}
<A>__{a moment later, langdon, now wearing white cotton gloves, sets the tiny manuscript on a viewing stand.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{diagramma della verita. the diagram of truth.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{i know about dialogo and discorsi galileo laid out his theories about the earth revolving around the sun, and the church forced him to recant. but what was this?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{this is where he got the word out. the truth, not what the vatican forced him to write. smuggled out of rome and printed in holland on sedge papyrus. that way any scientists caught with a copy could simply drop it in water and the booklet would dissolve.}
<A>__{carefully, he turns the first page.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{between its delicate nature and the vatican burnings, it's said this is the only copy that remains.}
<P>__{(turns the second page)}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{and if i'm right the segno should be hidden }
<P>__{(and the third)}
<D>__{ on page number }

<D>__{ five.}
<A>__{he stops. they study the page,}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{latin. can you ?}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{a bit.}
<A>__{she reaches for the book, to pull it towards her, but langdon slaps her hand. he holds up his own, glove}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{finger acids.}
<A>__{she rolls her eyes and leans in, studying the page. there are sketches on the page as well.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{movement of the planets... elliptical orbits... heliocentricity...}
<A>__{langdon's nervous. this doesn't sound right. vittoria turns the page, turns it back.}

<D>__{i'm sorry, i don't think there's anything that could be interpreted as a }
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{do that again.}
<A>__{she turns the page, then turns it back. noticing something in the deep crevice of the margin as the page moves, langdon grabs a magnifying glass on the end of a long pole and swings it over. there, in the print gutter, what looked like a smudge is revealed under the magnifier to be }
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{a line of texterior in english.}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{english? why english?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{no one spoke it at the vatican. it was considered polluted. too free thinking, the language of radicals like shakespeare and chaucer.}
<A>__{he rotates the book.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{another line.}
<A>__{he keeps rotating the book, finds two more tiny lines written at the very edges, barely visible to the naked eye.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{"the path of light is laid, the sacred test..." i need a pen, we have to transcribe this.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{sorry, professor. no time.}
<A>__{before langdon can do anything to stop her, she rips the page from the text and shoves it in her pocket. langdon's jaw drops. he shoots a look over his shoulder at lt. chartrand, but the man's back is turned.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{ah, what the hell.}
<A>__{he snaps the magnifying glass off the end of its pole.}
