<A>__{music is playing. a nice view is revealed as mercy arrives on a nice little porch. on a little table sits a potted plant. in the potted plant is an altoids tin. mercy gives it a rattle. in the tin, a brand new key. mercy takes the key. slides it into the lock and slowly opens the door. the music gets louder. she can't see much into the tiny flat, but she can make out... larry, arranging the last of his stuff. mercy stands at the door until he sees her. when he does, he says nothing. but steps to her and smells her her neck, her hair.}
