<C>__{bob ray}
<D>__{hey sailor... wait a minute... i got somethin for ya.}
<A>__{as bob ray passes lula on the stairs he puts his hand between her legs. sailor starts to see red. bob ray smiles and steps down to sailor. he leans in and whispers in sailors ear.}

<P>__{(shows sailor one thousand dollars in cash)}
<D>__{marietta just gave me this to kill you right now, and afterward she said lula was mine to fuck all the way into next sunday.}
<A>__{bob ray pulls a knife, but sailors fist is already halfway through bob rays brain. from there, sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone. amidst blood curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of southern belles, sailor starts taking bob ray apart limb by limb and doesnt stop until bob ray lays completely destroyed and completely dead at the foot of the stairs. the crowd of formally dressed onlookers stand aghast. sailor stares up at marietta. both their eyes burning with hate.}
