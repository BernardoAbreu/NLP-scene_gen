<L>__{interior record store day}
<A>__{saturday. for the first time we see the place kind of busy. rob watches the room. barry is toward the back, talking to a customer. "cruel to be kind" by nick lowe plays.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{it's almost impossible to find, especially on cd. yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables. but every other echo and the bunnymen album }
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{i have all of the others.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{oh really. well what about the first jesus and mary chain?}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{they always seemed...}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{they always seemed what? they always seemed really great, is what they always seemed. they picked up where your precious echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more echo albums. i can't believe that you don't own that record. that's insane.}
<A>__{he plucks it from the rack, and sticks it in the customer's hand, who regards it with a bit a of shame.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{well what about the new echo }
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{do not get ahead of yourself.}
<B>__{dick}
<A>__{is listening to a female customer, but he doesn't hear her voice. customer dick's pov the army bag with a red cross on it. the ring of ivy tattoo around the wrist. the monkey boots. the eye shadow.}
<B>__{dick}
<A>__{thinking, calculating...}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{the interesting thing about green day is that so much of their music is in truth directly influenced by, in my opinion, two bands.}
<C>__{female customer}
<D>__{the clash.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{correct. the clash. but also the stranglers.}
<C>__{female customer}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i think you would love the stranglers...}
<A>__{dick pulls a stranglers record and puts it on the stereo. her brow furrows, and then she smiles.}
<C>__{female customer}
<D>__{this sounds great.}
<A>__{dick smiles humbly. two people in the store turn and approach.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{is this the new green day?}
<A>__{barry still talking to his customer, who now has several cd's in his hand. he looks at barry with a mixture of hate and adoration.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{that is perverse. do not tell anyone you don't own fucking blonde on blonde. what about television?}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{i have a television.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{no !}
<A>__{barry adds more records to the customer's stack. a few minutes later rob and dick stand behind the counter. rob holds a cd in his hand, and surveys the roaming customers with a semi serious air of authority.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i will now sell four copies of cats and dogs by the royal trux.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{do it. do it.}
<A>__{rob pops the cd in and it begins to play... he stands there with his arms folded, waiting. after a moment, a customer approaches.}
<C>__{customer}
<P>__{(re: music)}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it's the royal trux.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{it's great.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{rob's pov of the room. something has caught his eye: a cropped head with a leopard skin pattern surfaces and disappears, like nessie. rob's face gets hot and mad. he jumps out from behind the counter.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{dick, ring the man up...}
<A>__{he moves like a cat through the crowd. justin sees him coming and counters around the middle island and heads for the door. vince appears next to him, fiddling with his belt. he sees rob now, and he and justin bolt for the door. rob doubles back.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{dick! the door!}
<A>__{dick sees vince and justin too late. rob is right behind them and as they get out the door, he reaches... and comes up with the back half of a skateboard.}
