<A>__{aibileen, black, 53, sits at a table in a small, green kitchen. she wears a yellow dress with black piping and grips a tattered spiral notebook. although cracked, the window behind her is crystal clear. three framed portraits hang on the wall above her: john f. kennedy, dr. martin luther king, jr. and an unknown young black male wearing thick glasses. aibileen swallows hard.}
