<A>__{"burch's stock:" arrive at freeman's slave pen. they are led in by freeman and his house slave cape a mulatto. the yard is enclosed by plank, standing upright, with ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with burch's. including burch's group there are about 30 slaves in the pen. solomon and the others look around and see nothing but downtrodden and despondent faces. three men sit next to each other with muzzles and quietly stare back at this new batch of arrivals. one attempts to speak, but all that comes out is a muffled, unintelligible sound.}
