<A>__{the lincoln turns into the forecourt of seagrave's garage and showroom. his business, which has clearly seen better days, is hot rodding and customized cars. behind the unwashed glass of the showroom is a fiberglass replica of a 1930s brooklands racer, faded bunting stuffed into the seat. they get out of the car, helping the woozy seagrave through the door at the side of the showroom, which leads to the stairway up to the apartment above the garage.}
