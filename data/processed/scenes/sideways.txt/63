<A>__{miles slows to walk between rows of grapevines. he polishes off the bottle and tosses it. a painting jack catches up with him in the adjacent grapevine corridor. miles's face crumbles as though he were about to cry. then he collapses to the ground and closes his eyes tight. jack looks around impatiently for a moment. then he squats down so he can see miles underneath the vines.}
