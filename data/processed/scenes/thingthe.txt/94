<L>__{exterior glacier tracking with macready, norris and palmer}
<A>__{as they walk along the ice. they come to a stop at the edge of a sharp drop. pull back to reveal the massive black hole about fifteen feet beneath the ice. charred, gnarled and mangled metal are all that is left of what was once an enormous sphere. macready's and norris' eyes meet each other in silence. palmer is in awe.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{wow...}
<A>__{macready finds a burst thermite canister. he and norris climb down. they move along amongst the wreck. almost everything but the skeletal superstructure has disintegrated into a fine ashy powder. norris digs for ice samples at the perimeter of the wreckage, while macready browses through the center. palmer continues to marvel, as he walks around the oval, atop the ice. macready returns and kneels down next to norris as the latter examines a piece of metal.}
<C>__{norris}
<D>__{magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.}
<P>__{(looks out at debris in disgust)}
<D>__{and those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{so what do you make of it?}
<C>__{norris}
<D>__{you know damn well what we both make of it.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{no chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?}
<A>__{norris shakes his head no.}
<C>__{norris}
<D>__{seismic activity has been pushing this are up from way down for a long time...}
<P>__{(holds up ice sample)}
<D>__{...this ice it was buried in... it's over a hundred thousand years old.}
<A>__{palmer calls out, waving them over.}
