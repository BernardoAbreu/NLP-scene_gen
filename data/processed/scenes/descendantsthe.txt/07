<B>__{a scrapbook}
<A>__{shows photos of elizabeth lying in her hospital bed. the compositions are odd, the angles uncomfortably close. wide matt confers with fifth grade teacher ms. hayashi and school counselor mrs. thull.}
<C>__{ms. hayashi}
<D>__{we just don't think these photographs are appropriate for scottie to be sharing with her classmates. some of them went home quite disturbed, and we got some angry calls from parents.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, she's sort of been going to town with the whole picture taking thing, but i had no idea }
<C>__{ms. hayashi}
<D>__{i can't tell you how my heart goes out to you and your family, but scottie just hasn't been herself. principal cruz agrees with us that it maybe would be better for scottie to remain at home with you during this difficult time.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{home. see, i would think that sticking to her normal routine would be the best thing for her you know, keep her occupied. i wouldn't really know how to...}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{i mean, i've kind of got my hands full. and her sister's away at school on the big island. i don't think scottie would really want to hang out with me when she could be with her friends and people like you who specialize in children.}
<C>__{mrs. thull}
<D>__{mr. king, we see this every day children acting out at school when something's wrong at home. and your family is facing a devastating crisis. have you been engaging scottie in really talking about what's going on? encouraging her to express her feelings? that's crucial.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(no)}
<D>__{oh, yeah. yeah. absolutely.}
<C>__{scottie }
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{this shit is bananas. b a n a n a s. this shit is bananas.}
<A>__{they look over to see ten year old scottie king earbuds in place and in her own world, dancing just outside the classroom door. a janitor down the hall eyes her suspiciously.}
<C>__{scottie }
<D>__{this shit is bananas. b a n a n a s!}
<A>__{matt stares aghast at this specimen called his daughter. the ladies glance between scottie and matt, wondering when, or whether, he'll intervene. finally }
<C>__{ms. hayashi}
<D>__{scottie, that is not a good choice! are you making a good choice?}
<A>__{scottie remains oblivious. ms. hayashi rises to her feet.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{yeah, scottie, come on. knock it off.}
