<L>__{exterior baptist church day}
<A>__{frank and charlie look on as ana throws the bouquet.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{she's the most beautiful bride i ever saw, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i wish bumpy could've met her. i wish she could've met him.}
<A>__{looking at the lucas table of organization }
<C>__{toback}
<D>__{what do you got on him you can use in court? because this isn't it. you try this without informants and powder, no one's going to jail.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{won't get any informants. not inside. it's like a sicilian family. like he's structured his own family the same way to protect himself.}
<A>__{exactly like one, like a scene from the godfather as frank dances with ana before the reception guests.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{being with bumpy long as he was, he would have been around italians a lot. enough to learn that much.}
<A>__{rice rains down on the bride and groom as they climb into the back of the towncar. doc comes around to the driver's side, gets in and slowly pushes through the crush of guests waving and throwing kisses.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{but it's not even frank lucas i want. i want to know who he's working for: which italians are bringing the heroin in.}
