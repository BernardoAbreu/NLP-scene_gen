<L>__{exterior campus day}
<A>__{julie explodes out of the building. hurries down a sidewalk. will finally catches up.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{julie! wait! you okay?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you don't seem fine.}
<A>__{julie realizes this is true.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i had another dream, will.}
<A>__{will takes this seriously.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{the shower again?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{it was in a church...it was so real. i mean, i could feel his breath on me.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(caring)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i thought i was over the dreams for good. i really did. i hadn't had one for months.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it just takes time, julie. it's gonna get better.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{it can't get worse. i mean, it's not like this was the first time i freaked out in class. i hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, i'm this close from being thrown out of school.}
<A>__{blam! blam! blam! explosions. julie jumps out of her skin. it's just students letting off firecrackers as they fly past on bicycles. will and julie are now thinking the same thing.}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{it was one year ago...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's...the anniversary. that's what's going on...take it easy on yourself.}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(weary)}
<D>__{i'm trying. i really am...sometimes i don't even know why i came up here in the first place.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(cheering her up)}
<D>__{to get out of southport?}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(softens)}
<D>__{right. now i remember.}
<A>__{he smiles at her. she smiles back. they stop in front of her apartment building.}
<C>__{julie }
<D>__{are you getting out of town on the fourth?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{nah. i will probably just be here studying for finals. the joys of summer school...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i'm okay.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<A>__{she touches his face affectionately.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{thanks for the talk, will. you're good to me.}
<A>__{will stands there akwardly }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{um...okay. bye.}
<A>__{will walks away. julie watches him a beat, then turns down her walk }
<B>__{ray}
<A>__{steps out of the shadows. julie practically faints.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{oh, my god, ray. you scared me.}
<A>__{recovering, she hugs ray, genuinely glad to see him. he's a bit cold.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i got in early. i was excited...}
<P>__{(re: the receding will)}
<D>__{who was that guy?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{oh, that's will. he's a friend. you'd like him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{ray, we're just friend.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good friend thing first.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{why are you being like this?}
<A>__{it should be obvious ray feels insecure in the college environs, but they're miscommunicating.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hey, i'm sorry. you're right. are you ready to go? i've got the old truck. you know the drill...crab boil at ollie's. croaker queen pageant...it's only small town fun, but it's still nice. people really miss you. i miss you.}
<A>__{she looks at ray, his compassionate demeanor. this is hard to say }
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(softly, but resolved)}
<D>__{ray, i can't...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{can't what?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. like some critical piece is missing. please understand...}
<A>__{ray is cold. this is what he's expected all along.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i understand something.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{it's not like that. it's not you. it's me. my head. i want to go back. i want to be with you. i want to be fine. i want everything to be like it used to be.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it just isn't.}
<A>__{ray is hurt and confused.}
<C>__{julie }
<D>__{hey, why don't you stay up here? they have fireworks over the river. and...there's a million things to do.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i have to work, julie. my boat's in southport, remember? but, i get it. you need your space from craokerland. and maybe from me, too.}
<A>__{ray starts walking away.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{you know where to find me.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{ray? ray? at least come up for a while.}
<A>__{ray keeps on walking.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's okay. i'm just gonna go.}
<A>__{julie follows him out to the road. a group of laughing students block her way.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{ray, i'm sorry. i didn't mean...}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{i'm just scared...that's all.}
<A>__{but ray is already gone. julie stares after him a beat, then turns quickly to her door. she clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the walk alone. she nervously pulls her keys. a can of mace dangles from the keychain.}
