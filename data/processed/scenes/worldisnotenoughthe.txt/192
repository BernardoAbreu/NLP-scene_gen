<A>__{bond makes for his bmw, running down a flight of steps, onto a lower walkway when...the section ahead of him explodes...the second chopper above hitting its mark with a thrown grenade. bond is trapped by the fire and smoke, the only way out is along the pipelines...he runs along a narrow section of pipe and then jumps down to another walkway. the pipes are now above him...the chopper's relentless saws cut through the pipe...gas jets out...bond hurls himself up a stairway.}
