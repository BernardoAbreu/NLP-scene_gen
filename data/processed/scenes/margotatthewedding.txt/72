<A>__{the four of them get out of a taxi. a small, peeling hotel.}
<L>__{interior hotel room continuous}
<A>__{a dark tight space with a faded and dirty green wall to wall carpet. pauline combs ingrid's hair on one of the two double beds. ingrid practices her wedding song. claude sits on the other bed and looks into the open bathroom door: margot stands with her back to him. she talks on her cell phone in a whisper. she hangs up. claude walks inside. the sink drips.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{sweety, there's a bus that leaves to vermont from town tomorrow morning. i just talked to your dad and he's going to pick you up.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{aren't you coming?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i have to help out paul and ingrid.}
<A>__{claude tugs gently on his yellow bracelet.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i don't want to go tomorrow.}
<A>__{the distant bong of a low drum and beneath that chanting. claude follows margot to the window. ingrid and pauline are already looking out. clumps of demonstrators march in the street. some people hold up signs with slogans no more bring back the rest is obscured from the window. some marchers are dressed in black hoods with white face paint and carry cardboard coffins.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{there's malcolm.}
<A>__{pauline points to a guy in a vest. as he turns around we see it isn't him. pauline withdraws, suddenly on the verge of tears.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i can't live in that house alone.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you're going to be fine.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{maybe...maybe i could get a place in brooklyn williamsburg or something. people are living there right?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you don't want to live there. it's all young people.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{but what do you think of that idea?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{maybe. let's see. you know if you don't want to come with me, i'm sure mom will let you stay with her }
<C>__{pauline}
<P>__{(through tears)}
<D>__{you're already trying to pass me off on mom...}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{don't say that. come on, you'll come home with us.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you don't even know where you're going to live. you might have to move in with mom too.}
<A>__{margot tightens.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{what? oh.}
<P>__{(mouthing a whisper)}
<D>__{didn't you tell him?}
<A>__{margot looks at her son who continues to watch out the window.}
