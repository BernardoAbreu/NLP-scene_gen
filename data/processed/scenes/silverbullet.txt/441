<L>__{interior haller}
<A>__{his eyes widen. sound: shattering roar and the clink and tumble of about nine thousand cans as lowe erupts from under the aluminum scrap heap behind haller. he is a mixture of man and werewolf, and quite clearly a beastial version of lowe. in one hand he holds the remains of owen knopfler's peacemaker. haller starts to turn; lowe strikes him with the bat. camera closes in on lowe as the bat rises and falls... rises and falls. we can't see haller, and that is probably a mercy, but we can hear the thud of the bat as it strikes again and again and again.}
