<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior barracks night (dusk)}
<A>__{we now see the barracks completely (shooting from flat on), the wooden bunks are housed in a low wooden building with eight two tier bunks on each side. a group of men are clustered around keltner's bunk. here we meet: adolf, a large, once powerful man, in his mid thirties. ludwig, once a fairly prosperous businessman before his politics landed him in prison, is older, and his bitterness is written all over his face. franz, is the youngest. he is a sensitive looing twenty five year old, more than likely the "rebel" type of the 1930s. helmut is in his upper bunk over keltner writing on an old piece of paper with a scruffy pencil, which he bites to make a point of, and wets with his tongue like any fat butcher selling liverwurst and marking the price on a brown paper bag... (i.e. brooklyn, circa 1928). we truck the camera down the long barrack to include the other men doing their things. a couple of men are getting ready for a card game... several others are comparing clothing, mending and helping one another, a couple play chess. a few are sleeping, but for the most part, most of the men lay in their bunks staring at the ceiling... the floors are spotless... suffice to say they better be... the walls have nothing hanging but a few socks drying... a torn calendar, wrong year, etc. close keltner group johann sits with his back to camera... at the edge of his bunk, leaving room on his bunk for adolph, ludwig, franz. he is showing something to them that we cannot see. keltner's body covers whatever it is that the three men are gawking at, facing camera... and they are indeed gawking with delight and admiration.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{i think we should eat it!}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{not on your life...}
<P>__{(catching himself)}
<D>__{er, that is... i wouldn't...}
<C>__{franz}
<D>__{put it somewhere so it can brighten up the place.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<P>__{(sourly)}
<D>__{it would take a hell of a lot more than that to brighten up this place.}
<C>__{adolf}
<D>__{it'll be better than looking at your long face.}
<A>__{chuckling, keltner rises. we boom up with him, and as his head comes up over the top of the bottom bunk... he holds out the object for helmut to see... it is a potato, a sorry looking spud... that keltner has put in a small can of water and is beginning to sprout two sick looking shoots.}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(to helmut)}
<D>__{do you see the way it's sprouting... i told you it wasn't completely rotten.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(his mind on his thing)}
<D>__{that's nice, johann. do you remember when i filled out those last forms? the date might be important.}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(almost annoyed)}
<D>__{about four weeks ago, i think.}
<B>__{looser shot}
<A>__{as keltner walks away from helmut's bunk.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{i will put it up here on the window sill, it'll get the morning sun.}
<A>__{he reaches the window and starts to reach up, to place the potato on the sill... a hand shoots out holding the hand of keltner...}
<C>__{stout prisoner}
<D>__{think you can trust your potato so close to me, reverend?}
<C>__{ludwig}
<D>__{the potato he trusts... it's you he doesn't trust!}
<A>__{all the men laugh, including the "stout prisoner" who laughs the loudest... keltner hands the stout prisoner the potato, who in turn takes same and places it gently on the window sill just adjacent to his bunk... after placing it on the sill, he gestures ala the trapeze artist after making a super truck, looking for applause... keltner pats his leg in a gesture of "thank you". he starts back towards his bunk when the front door of the barracks flings open and the guard enters.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{attention !}
<A>__{the men jump, but quickly, to their feet, and stand at attention at the front of their bunks, ala inspection in the army. they are rigid and waiting to hear what's up. the guard takes a few steps into the barracks... behind him we see several prisoners carrying bunks waiting to enter the barracks.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{all the prisoners from the other side of the camp are being moved over to this side of the camp over to this side of the camp. barracks "h" will make room for three additional bunks.}
<A>__{he takes a few steps down the aisle...}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{i want all the bunks moved down toward the far end. get them as close together as possible. now! get moving!}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{the men scramble back to their own bunks and immediately begin pulling, shoving, and grumbling comments about being too overcrowded as it is...}
<C>__{the men}
<P>__{(ad lib)}
<D>__{gotta have more room... we need more space... hey, watch where you're going. this is stupid!}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{you! you down there at the end... get those bunks right up against the wall.}
<A>__{close helmut and keltner as bunks are moved towards the far end of the barracks, keltner and helmut prepare to move their bunks, the last ones on their side. helmut and adolf, who have already made their move, come up to keltner to help him with his bunk... helmut sees that keltner has help so he decides to back off and hide in his little corner with his pencil and scrap of paper... totally involved with his own pain and his undying fantasy about his ultimate release... wider shot the entire barracks the guard looks down the barracks as the men just about finish the moving job...}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{hurry it up! come on, get moving!}
<A>__{the guard turns towards the door and motions for the six prisoners to enter the barracks... they enter by pairs, each pair carrying a double tier bunk. their personal belongings are piled on the bunks and slung over their shoulders in sacks (barracks bags)... the guard motions for the two bunks to be placed next to helmut's and one on the opposite side... next to the stout prisoner... note: this arrangement leaves space for one additional bunk right by the door. the guard motions for the stout prisoner and herman to give the new arrivals a hand with the placement of their bunks.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{get them close.}
<P>__{(he looks around the barracks)}
<D>__{you're all going to be nice and cozy in here.}
<C>__{stout prisoner}
<P>__{(in a loud voice)}
<D>__{yeah, like triplets before they are born to a mother weighing 98 pounds...}
<C>__{herman}
<D>__{that's what i call cozy!}
<A>__{the guard smiles, and all the men laugh...}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the guard starts for the door, satisfied with the arrangements... as he gets the door open, helmut runs over to catch him before he makes his exit...}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(anxiously)}
<D>__{excuse me, sir, the papers... did they arrive yet?}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{they'll have to wait!}
<A>__{he exits, closing the door behind him. helmut, with a look of despair on his face, goes back to his bunk. med. shot helmut and keltner}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{you'd think, since he was coming over here anyway, the least he could do was bring the papers with him.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{this moving men around has undoubtedly kept him very busy... don't worry, he'll bring them.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i'm sure if i asked him again he'd really become annoyed with me. would you remind him for me, please?}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(kindly)}
<D>__{of course i will.}
<A>__{helmut climbs up to his bunk and goes back to his precious paper work.}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{as the new prisoners make up their bunks and arrange their belongings, the regulars of barracks h, among them adolf, ludwig, herman and franz, begin moving towards them to meet them. keltner turns to the new white haired prisoner whose bunk is directly next to his.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{i've seen you around the yard, but the others... white haired man about thirty of them got here yesterday from the prison outside of frankfurt. 1st new prisoner}
<P>__{(who occupies the}
<D>__{bunk above the white }
<P>__{haired prisoner)}
<D>__{for the last three months we've been shuttled from one camp to another. 2nd new prisoner}
<P>__{(his bunk is the lower}
<D>__{bunk on the direct}
<P>__{opposite side)}
<D>__{now they're shuffling us from one side to another. i think they're trying to lose us.}
<C>__{herman}
<D>__{do you think they're bringing in war prisoners?}
<C>__{ludwig}
<D>__{i don't know why they're sending them here... we're overcrowded as it is.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{no, no... it's got to be something else... otherwise they would have left the bunks.}
<C>__{adolf}
<D>__{it could be possible that he is fixing up the barracks for some of his lady friends.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{that many women?}
<C>__{herman}
<P>__{(standing at attention)}
<D>__{reverend, we germans are supermen!}
<A>__{all the men break out in laughter at herman's comment and his actions... but the laughter is cut short as they hear the door open again, and they all look in that direction.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{shooting over the men onto the door, entering is the same guard that was just there... this time he enters with two more prisoners carrying their bunks. one of them is josef galt, a burly bully like man, who knows all the tricks of survival, and ernst uhlmann, a think little man with a face like a weasel... they follow the guard into the barracks proper.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{attention !}
<A>__{the men quickly snap to attention. the guard indicates for galt and uhlmann to put the bunk in the space right by the door.}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{we might as well be outside.}
<C>__{uhlmann}
<D>__{if i get pneumonia, i will hold the government responsible!}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{with a little luck, you'll both get pneumonia!}
<A>__{the guard turns and moves towards the door, stops, and turns to see all is well, and exits the door, closing it behind him. galt sits on the lower bunk as uhlmann sprints up to the upper bunk and looks towards the original men, who are just standing around watching the two new "fish"... then men sense trouble and slowly and quietly return to their own bunks... some of the other men just stare at the two new prisoners...}
<C>__{uhlmann}
<P>__{(sitting on his bunk)}
<D>__{it's sure quiet in here...}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{uhlmann in his surveying the barracks spots the potato plant on the window sill... next to the stout prisoner's bunk... he jumps from his bunk and runs over towards the plant... he takes it from the window sill and yells over to galt...}
<C>__{uhlmann}
<D>__{hey, galt! come over and look at this!}
<C>__{galt}
<P>__{(coming over to uhlmann)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{uhlmann}
<D>__{ain't it cute?}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{it's a god damn posie!}
<A>__{he and uhlmann burst into laughter...}
<C>__{uhlmann}
<D>__{looks kinda sick, doesn't it?}
<C>__{galt}
<P>__{(examining it)}
<D>__{it's one of them potato things... and it sure as hell is sick!}
<C>__{uhlmann}
<D>__{maybe we should put it out of its misery.}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{no, we don't want to do that... we might break someone's heart.}
<A>__{he looks around at the other prisoners.}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{whose little plant is this?}
<A>__{the stout prisoner gets up from his bunk and starts to move forward and challenge galt... but keltner jumps from his bunk and gets to galt first.}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(with deep conviction)}
<D>__{the plant is mine!}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{is it now? tell me precious... do you knit, too?}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{if necessary, i can... and i do !}
<A>__{this brings a ripple of laughter from the others... particularly the new prisoners who are delighted at seeing someone stand up to galt for a change... galt with a sneer on his face steps out into the aisle to face keltner square on!}
<C>__{galt}
<P>__{(to uhlmann)}
<D>__{what do you think of that, uhlmann... he knits!}
<C>__{uhlmann}
<D>__{now, if he could just cook...}
<A>__{galt and uhlmann laugh, but they are the only ones that do...}
<C>__{galt}
<P>__{(coming out of the laugh)}
<D>__{can you cook, sweetheart?}
<A>__{keltner knows damn well he can't fight the brute, yet he realizes that if he steps down, life not only for him, but for the others in the barracks will be intolerable under galt's bully rule. (during the following dialogue, adolf, franz, ludwig, herman and the stout prisoner... easy up a little closer to keltner and galt.)}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{if necessary, i can cook, yes! now, if you don't mind, i will take that plant!}
<A>__{he holds out his hand... galt, wearing a deceptive smile, eyes the older man...}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{alright, old man, you really want it?}
<A>__{he raises his arm over his head with the plant in that hand.}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{go get it!!}
<A>__{close keltner he looks past galt at helmut who is sitting up on his bunk... closer keltner he looks at helmut. his eyes try to encourage helmut to do something, say something, do anything to show that he is on keltner's side. close helmut he sits up on his bunk, and wants nothing to do with the bully and his pranks... so he goes back to studying his papers and looks up again to catch keltner's look of disappointment, and as keltner turns away from helmut... helmut realizes he should do something to show keltner he, indeed, cares... he jumps down from his bunk and grabs galt by the arm and turns him around... they are now face to face...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{why don't you pick on someone your own size...}
<C>__{galt}
<P>__{(shocked, but pleased}
<D>__{that he finally got}
<P>__{a rise out of someone)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{you heard me! give him his plant back, and leave him alone... he didn't bother you ... and if you have to show your muscle, there's plenty of other guys to pick on!}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{you're my size!}
<A>__{... and with this, galt smacks helmut a shot across the mouth that sends him spilling into the corner, half knocked unconcious... he lays there with blood flowing from his mouth... keltner leaves galt and runs to the corner to see if helmut is okay. galt follows him... keltner is leaning down checking helmut... as galt bends down next to the two of them... still holding the plant.}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{he's alright... that'll teach him to keep his nose out of my business... here's your plant!}
<A>__{galt makes like he's handing the plant to keltner, who reaches for it, and as he does galt slowly stands up making keltner reach and reach and reach... and as keltner gets closer and closer, galt stands to his fullest height... making it literally impossible for keltner to get it... franz, ludwig, adolf, herman and the stout prisoner (more than likely provoked by helmut's stand, now circle galt)...}
<C>__{galt}
<P>__{(still holding the plant up high)}
<D>__{go on, little man, reach for it!}
<A>__{keltner, torn between seeing that helmut is alright, and getting his plant back, tries to get it, and still looks to see that helmut isn't hurt too bad...}

<P>__{(in a low menacing voice)}

<A>__{galt looks at him with a menacing stare...}

<C>__{franz}
<D>__{you've had your fun... give it to him... now!}
<C>__{stout prisoner}
<P>__{(closing in on galt)}
<D>__{right now!!}
<A>__{galt realizes this is no time for a showdown... and with a childlike smile... grits his teeth...}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{sure, here's your stupid flower or whatever you call it...}
<A>__{keltner takes it from him.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{thank you...}
<A>__{keltner leans down and picks helmut up and walks him to his bunk, helps him onto it, and puts the plant on his own bunk...}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the four men: ludwig, adolf, franz and herman stay with galt, as does the stout prisoner... they are clustered around galt.}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{what's the matter with you guys? can't you take a joke?}
<C>__{adolf}
<D>__{what joke?}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{hell, all i was doing was trying to have a little fun.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<D>__{have it with someone else!}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{what's so special about him?}
<C>__{adolf}
<D>__{that's the reverend. even when they came and dragged him from his church... he kept right on preaching against them until they knocked him unconscious.}
<A>__{galt is silent for a beat.}

<D>__{well, how the hell was i supposed to know?}
<C>__{herman}
<D>__{now you know!}
<A>__{galt shoves his way through the five men and walks beaten, for the moment, to his own bunk... as the men disperse and walk back to their respective bunks... close galt and uhlmann galt walks over and sits at the edge of his bunk, while uhlmann swings his legs back and forth from his perched position on the top of his bunk... galt gives him a stare...}

<C>__{galt}
<D>__{aw, shut up!}
<A>__{and he smacks his legs up and onto the bunk. two shot keltner and helmut keltner with a wet towel in his hand cleaning the blood dripping mouth of helmut...}

<D>__{that was really very nice of you, helmut...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{yeah, nice and stupid!}
