<L>__{interior new orleans restaurant night, 1945}
<A>__{a crowded new orleans restaurant. daisy as a maitre d in slow motion is showing her to a table... men's, and even women's, eyes following her...}
<C>__{daisy's }
<D>__{...they have torn up all the conventions... the straight up and down style, all the things that bound dancers...it's not about the formality of the dance...the classical structure...it's about what the dancer's feeling...there are no rules; the movement can be tense or relaxed, abrupt or flowing, carefree or somber, it may suggest love or hate, attraction or repulsion. the unexpected shifts of weight or energy not just to shock but to reinvent tradition...putting the familiar form to new and unexpected uses. it's so basic just you alone with your body...}
<A>__{they reach a table... a chair in slow motion swept out for her to sit... another man in slow motion putting a napkin in her lap...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{they understand america's vigor and physicality they understand the freshness of the american people at their most modern, at their best.}
<C>__{benjamin button's }
<D>__{and she told me about this world that she was so attracted to... names that didn't mean a thing to me...i didn't really hear very much of what she was saying.}
<A>__{we watch them at the table... benjamin listening, appreciating her... her face aglow with the intensity and the passion of youth... caviar is brought over... vodka... she screws up her mouth not wanting to eat... we can sense he's telling her, what he's learned from elizabeth abbott, how to savor it... he feeds her a spoonful... they drink the vodka washing it down... she laughs, delighted... and we now hear what she is saying...}

<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{oh my god, i've been just talking about myself...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{i'm enjoying listening...}
<A>__{she takes out a cigarette... he instinctively looks for matches, a man gets there first, lighting her cigarette for her... he watches the smoke curl around her... appreciating her...}
<C>__{benjamin }
<D>__{i didn't know you smoked...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{i'm old enough. i`m old enough for a lot of things....}
<C>__{benjamin}
