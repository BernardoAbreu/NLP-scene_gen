<A>__{she climbs out into the bitter cold, hunched against the howling wind, and moves off as far as she dares from the car. she fumbles with the buttons and zippers of her multiple layers, turns her back to the car, squats to pee. her teeth chatter as she does her business, one wary eye peeled to catch the guy peeking. suddenly, out of the gloom appears a dark figure, moving by very near her. she gasps. tumbles back onto her ass. as she's struggling to pull up her pants more dark figures appear, moving in the same direction. as the figures enter the woods their leader turns so she glimpses his face: elderly and unremarkable at first glance, then for an instant changing into a twisted ashen deathmask. her scream brings our guy bolting out of the car.}

<D>__{what?! what happened?!}
<A>__{but it all happened so fast she doesn't believe her eyes. she gestures at the procession of dark figures disappearing ahead.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(still in shock)}
<D>__{ did you see? they were right here! }
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{why didn't you stop them?! maybe they have a phone!}
<A>__{our guy ducks back into the car, retrieves a flashlight from the glove compartment. he eases the door shut, carefully so it doesn't latch and accidentally lock them out. the he starts off running after the figures. scared as she is, she decides to follow rather than remain at the car by herself.}
