<L>__{exterior driveway night}
<A>__{rollo's car pulls up to the main doors and parks in a blatantly illegal space. he flips up a card on the dash which says 'm.d. on call,' then gets out of the car. he walks up the steps and through the main doors, which are wide open. nobody is in sight.}
<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{rollo walks along the hallway, bag in hand, envelope under arm. he stops in front of tudor's door, checks the number against the number written in his notebook, then knocks on the door. nobody answers. he knocks once more, then looks around shiftily before turning the knob and walking right in.}
