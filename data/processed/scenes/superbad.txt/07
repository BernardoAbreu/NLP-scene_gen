<A>__{bird's eye view of a p.e. class there are 30 guys standing behind the starting line of the school's track. we hear a teacher yell "go!" and the boys start running. we follow them from above. all the boys keep pretty much the same pace except for one runner who slowly lags behind. the group gets so far ahead of the him that he is alone in the frame. he stops.}
