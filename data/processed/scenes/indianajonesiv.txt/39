<D>__{sun wu kung's legendary hideout...an enormous secret cave, hidden behind a running waterfall.}
<A>__{clare again reaches for her coffee. the cup and saucer are still trembling. clare peeks under the table, and again sees betsy's foot rubbing indiana's leg. clare gives a revolted grumble. indiana excitedly explains scraggy's translation.}

<A>__{indiana, clare and scraggy hurry from the table. a tipsy betsy follows. indiana passes the jazz band. he nonchalantly drops the mechanical bug into the trumpet player's horn! the trumpet player hits a piercing high note!}
