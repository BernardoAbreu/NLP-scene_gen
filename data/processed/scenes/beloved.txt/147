<L>__{interior kitchen night.}
<A>__{denver is cleaning the dishes. beloved sits like an angry, upset five year old with her fingers in her mouth.}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{she likes him here...}
<P>__{(to denver)}
<D>__{make him go away.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{she'd be mad if he leaves.}
<A>__{beloved didn't consider that. her fingers move violently in her mouth as if something were bothering her...until, finally, she pulls out a back tooth...her lips slightly bloody.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{oooo..didn't that hurt you?}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{it's like my dreams...i get two dreams, see..one, i exploding...buuooggg...the other i being swallowed. sometimes it's hard to keep my head on my neck, or these legs connected to my hips...one day i think i might wake up and i will be in pieces..}
<P>__{(looks at tooth)}
<D>__{maybe it's starting.}
<C>__{denver}
<P>__{(cleans beloved's mouth)}
<D>__{oh stop. it's just a tooth. probably wisdom. does it hurt?}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{then why don't you cry?}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{if it hurts, why don't you cry?}
<A>__{beloved, eases herself into denver's arms, and cries...}
