<A>__{ray and crow horse are quiet as they eat up the dirt roads.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{maybe the old man's visions are still strong.}

<D>__{oh yeah. dreams. sometimes durin' sickness. vision quest. sweat lodge. ya never know when.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{just before we caught jimmy... i had a dream that i was being chased. and i was running with other people. old fashion indian people. i got shot in the back. like leo.}
<A>__{when crow horse doesn't respond, ray looks over and finds him staring. he looks back to the road. and when he looks back at crow horse, he is still staring at him.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{where was this?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{at wounded knee. i mean, that's where i was, and that's where the dream was. why?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{you were running with the old ones. at the knee. heavy duty.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{well, it was just a dream, i }
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{sonuvabuck! what's with you, man? who are you?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{nothin'. forget it.}
<A>__{crow horse looks out the window as if to avoid ray who is confused by the indian's smoldering. after a moment, crow horse looks at him.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{you had a vision. you had yourself a vision. a man waits a long time for a vision. might go his whole lifetime and never get one. and along comes some instant indian with a mastercard and brand new shoes, has himself a vision.}
<C>__{ray}

<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{i'm a full blood oglala.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{we've driven a long way. where is this place?}

<D>__{maybe it was just a dream. ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah. fitful dreams.}
<A>__{crow horse feels better. he looks out the window, nodding. but it doesn't last long.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{bullshit. you had a vision. you got sign from the old ones.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what the hell do you want me to do?!}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{stop.}
<A>__{ray brakes. crow horse is looking past him. ray turns. the spectacular mesa that we have admired with every sunrise, looms massive now that we are under it. moonlight falls on it. and the heartbeat drum pulses from it.}
