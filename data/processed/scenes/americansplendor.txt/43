<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior bus stop 1975 day}
<A>__{another r. crumb drawing of harvey (now circa 1975) on a sketch pad we see a deranged, tormented harvey sitting alone on a park bench. he pulls at his hair, and looks as though he may murder the next person who walks by.}
<L>__{intertitle: back to 1975}
<A>__{as the pencil adds shading to harvey's face, we hear:}
<C>__{real harvey }
<D>__{once he came to visit when i was really feelin' bad. it was right around the time of my throat operation, an' right after my second wife left me. at first it was pretty weird. i mean, here my life was falling apart an' everything was going great for him. i was on my second divorce an' he was a big hit with the chicks. i was a nothin' file clerk and he was this famous cartoonist.}
<A>__{harvey and r. crumb sit on a park bench together by a bus stop. a distraught harvey whines while crumb just sketches. harvey's voice is still raspy.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{i dunno, man. on the one hand most women gettin' graduate degrees wouldn't give a guy like me the time a' day. an' she married me an' everything, so i gotta give her some kinda credit. but then she got so mean to me in the end. an' it ain't like i tried t'keep her captive or anything like that, y'know?}
<A>__{crumb may or may not be listening to harvey. it's hard to tell.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{an' then on top of it i lost my voice for three months. i still sound like shit, but before i had nothin'. man, talk about hell. i started forgettin' what i sound like, y'know? so i started writin' stuff down stories an' things, my points a' view, ideas. i even published a couple jazz record reviews. i guess that ended up bein' a good thing.}
<C>__{crumb}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{but don't think i buy into this "growth" crap. everybody talks about how bad experiences can cause ya t'grow, an' all that cliched stuff. i've had enough bad experiences and growth to last me plenty.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{right now, i'd be glad to trade some growth for happiness.}
<A>__{for a moment, they both just sit there saying nothing to each other, each man in his own private universe. finally harvey looks over to crumb.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{so how long are ya stayin' in cleveland?}
<A>__{crumb never looks up from his picture.}
<C>__{crumb}
<D>__{i dunno, man. i gotta go visit this chick in new york. and i'm really busy with the comic book stuff. it's good bread and all man but i'm getting fed up with the whole scene.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{what are ya talkin' about? yer makin' a good living doin' yer art? sheesh. how many guys get that lucky in their life, huh?}
<C>__{crumb}
<D>__{yeah, i dunno.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{ya know man, people are startin' to know the name "crumb." when you croak you're gonna leave something behind.}
<C>__{crumb}
<D>__{yeah, my ashes and some crappy doodles. it's not like i'm blind lemon jefferson or big mama thornton.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{c'mon, man. it sure beats workin' a gig like mine being a nobody flunky and sellin' records on the side for a buck.}
<C>__{crumb}
<D>__{yeah, well that's true...}
<A>__{harvey nods in agreement, mulling this over. he's not at all offended.}
