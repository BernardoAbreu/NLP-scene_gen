<L>__{interior hotel room}
<A>__{derek lets himself in, doesn't even click on the lights. there's enough moonlight coming through the window to lead him to the bed where he flops down on his back. he doesn't even bother to undress. derek closes his eyes, then opens them. he feels sick. sound and perception are playing games with his head. the room begins to spin and he can hear a sound, a rushing noise. is it the shower in the bathroom? the bathroom door is shut but there's a crack of light around the edges. is someone in there? derek is too out of it to care. he just wants to sleep, make it go away. he closes his eyes, begins to drift off. the bathroom door opens, letting in a cloud of steam and a shaft of light. a woman's silhouette appears, naked. she moves to the bed. derek feels the bed move... feels a tug on his trousers... then, an amplified zzzziiippp. derek's eyes open in shock. he can't believe what he sees lisa, naked, straddling him. her hand caressing his face. it's like a dream. a nightmare. lisa smiles seductively and puts a finger to her lips.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{shhhhh.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(groggy; can barely get the word out)}
<D>__{no..}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{hush, baby.}
<A>__{her voice seems distorted like it's coming from another world.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{i'm going to take real good care of you.}
<A>__{derek tries to resist but finds he has no control over his body or mind. all he can see is a shifting, distorted image of lisa's face... her smile... her teeth.. her lips... the blazing look of sexual desire in her eyes. and somewhere in those eyes he can see himself. and that's the last thing derek sees before he passes out and the entire world goes black and silent. c}
