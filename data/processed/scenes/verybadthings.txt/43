<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{dirt being thrown on top of the reunited bodies until they are all completely buried.}
<L>__{exterior grave site}
<A>__{as the last of the dirt is packed down by boyd. the guys stare down at the grave site.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{now i am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. it's not. it's not a good thing. but it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. we did what had to be done. and... well... i'm proud of us. i'm proud of each and every one of us. we performed. under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. i feel proud.}
<B>__{silence.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{we are all going straight to hell. either hell or prison, whichever comes first.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{wrong. that is flat out wrong. hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strength of their own convictions. this is war. given the circumstances and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. two wrongs don't make a right. so our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.}
<C>__{moore}
<D>__{boyd... i don't know man... it just seems to me that ever since you took tony robbins self help thing... you're all fucked up in the head.}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{i got to agree with that.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{that is a load of shit. personal power has nothing to do with any of this. tony robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this... well that's just more than the man deserves.}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{i think we should say some words over the grave.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{what kind of words?}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{i'm talking about prayer.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{fisher steps to the grave, looks down.}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{dear god... i don't know how to pray.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{just go ahead and say what's on your mind.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{speak from the heart my brother.}
<A>__{adam turns in disgust.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{this is pathetic.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you're pathetic.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(turning on michael)}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{you're not a team player.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{don't point at me.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you never were a team player. that's why you never had any friends.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i have plenty of friends.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the hell you do.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{the hell i don't.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you have acquaintances business friends and superficial golf buddies. you have always been a fringe player. you have some serious male on male intimacy problems.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what are you fucking talking about?}
<A>__{michael looks at boyd.}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{michael, now is probably not the best time for this.}
<C>__{boyd}
<D>__{no, this is the perfect time. this is real time. adam. your brother and i, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...}
<P>__{(points to adam)}
<D>__{...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly boy butt fucker.}
<A>__{dead silence. adam stares stupefied at boyd, then michael. finally, fisher says his prayer.}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{dear god, please forgive us for what we have done here tonight. we have lost our way. speaking for myself, let me say...}
