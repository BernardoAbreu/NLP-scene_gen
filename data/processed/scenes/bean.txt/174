<A>__{the first morning without alison. "she's gone" by hall & oats begins to play, a song full of yearning. david feels the other side of the bed. no one there. he walks into the bathroom and turns on the shower. then walks back into the bedroom she's gone i've got to learn how to face it " he takes a towel from a cupboard and returns to the bathroom. he feels very alone. he removes his pyjamas and gets into the steam filled shower. she's gone she's gone" but the camera moves to reveal that he is not alone after all. bean has, simply entered the shower, and is now happily soaping himself, wearing alison's shower cap. manly screams from the both of them.}
