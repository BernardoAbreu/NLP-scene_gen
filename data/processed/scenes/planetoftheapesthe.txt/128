<L>__{149 a close taylor}
<A>__{taylor, looking much stronger, sits on a pile of dirty straw in the fourth cage. there is a clean bandage around his throat. he watches the block building primitive with contemptous amusement. both the third and fourth blocks tumble to the floor when the primitive tries to mount his tower. he stands there, staring dully at the scattered blocks, then up at the unattainable banana.}
<L>__{149 b med. the laboratory}
<A>__{a door at the end of the aisle opens and a gorilla named julius enters, dressed in a keeper's uniform. he quickly closes the door, snatches up a broom, starts sweeping. julius is obviously late for work. taylor struggles to his feet, moves to the bars of the cage, tries to call out.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(soundlessly)}
<D>__{hey! hey!}
<A>__{the three other primitives move toward the bars of their cages. julius barks at them.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{simmer down!}
<P>__{(points at taylor)}
<D>__{you especially.}
<A>__{the third primitive goes back to stacking his blocks. julius comes up to taylor's cage, indicates a like set of blocks strewn across its floor, extends his broom handle to whack the banana overhead.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{better give it a try, stupid. unless you like going hungry.}
<A>__{he returns to his sweeping. taylor glowers at him. a moment later, the door at the end of the aisle opens and dr. zira enters.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{good morning, dr. zira.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{good morning, julius. how's our patient today?}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{no change. the minute you open the door, he goes into his act.}
<A>__{she starts down the aisle toward taylor's cage. he grasps the bars, awaiting her anxiously. as she passes the second cage, the primitive in it shakes the bars, jumps up and down. his tongue is hanging out. zira smiles, stops, digs into the pocket of her smock.}
<C>__{zira}
<P>__{(playfully)}
<D>__{well, what do we want this morning? do we want something? speak! come on, speak!}
<A>__{the primitive continues to jump up and down energetically. zira takes a cube of sugar from her pocket, holds it up for his inspection.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{do we want some sugar, old timer?}
<A>__{the man eagerly sticks his hand through the bars. she drops the cube in his hands. he jams it into his mouth.}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{you could get hurt doing that, doctor.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{don't be silly. he's perfectly tame.}
<A>__{she moves toward taylor's cage, julius behind her.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{they're all tame until they take a chunk out of you.}
