<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{a carved wooden angel}
<A>__{eight feet tall, ascending into an afternoon sky. as the camera pulls back we see that we are inside a building and that the angel is dangling outside an open doorway high above the street. a group of workmen grab for the angel, but have difficulty bringing it in. suddenly molly steps into the frame.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{where you guys from, the new york city ballet?}
<A>__{with a gutsy maneuver, molly leans out over the sidewalk and tries to grab hold of the ropes. she can't reach them. suddenly a pair of hands grabs her around the waist. she screams.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{saved your life.}
<A>__{sam laughs as he pulls her back into the loft. she does not think it is funny.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you bastard. don't do that to me. you scared me half to death.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{better than seeing this gorgeous body splattered all over the street. here, look out.}
<A>__{sam jumps up, grabs hold of the door's top molding, and swings out over the sidewalk. molly gasps. sam's feet push at the angel and send it swinging away and then back toward the loft. quickly he jumps back, grabs hold of it, and brings it in. the workmen applaud. molly eyes him with admiration. suddenly we hear a voice call out.}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{sam? molly? anybody home?}
<A>__{molly looks to sam.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{carl? did you invite him?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{i couldn't keep him away.}
<A>__{carl enters, shakes molly's hand, and pats sam on the back.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hi, moll. hi, sam. so, how's it goin?}
<A>__{before they can answer, a workman turns to molly.}
