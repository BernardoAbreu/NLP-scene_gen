<A>__{now the size of a flea, stormie is clinging to one of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from the circular walls freddy's nose hairs. stuck in those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk boogers. sitting next to stormie, a particularly large and rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the distorted voice of harry manfredini):}
<C>__{boogerman}
<D>__{hi there! i'm the boogerman! heh heh... get it?}
<A>__{stormie screams, backing up into the "trees", trying to put distance between herself and boogerman.}
<C>__{boogerman}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{aww, don't go... we can play "star wars". you can be princess leia and i will be jabba the hutt!}
<A>__{boogerman licks his fat, nasty lips with a slimy green tongue he does kinda look like jabba. stormie screams again.}
