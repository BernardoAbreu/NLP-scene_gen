<C>__{erica}
<D>__{no, it's about me.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{am i in it?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{a guy like you is in it but he's not you.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what happens to this guy who's ..not me?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{haven't totally decided. he can live or he can die.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what are you leaning towards?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{death.}
<P>__{(harry reacts)}
<D>__{it's funnier.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{he dies of a funny heart attack?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{he's sort of a schmuck who screwed around with our heroine, so it won't be too sad.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{schmucks are people too you know. death doesn't seem a little harsh?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i just went where the story took me. it's a work of fiction, harry. really...just stuff i made up.}
<C>__{stage manager}
<P>__{(approaching)}
<D>__{erica, we're ready to do the hospital, 'do you take viagra scene... should we wait for you?}
<A>__{erica nods, horrified.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so i'm going to be the laughing stock of broadway.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{harry, he's not you. he's a version of the truth of you. so to speak.}
<C>__{stage manager}
<D>__{sorry to interrupt again but dave wants to know, when henry says, "i love ya", you want that to be 'ya', not 'you', right?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{we now hear louis armstrong's la vie en rose play throughout the theater. the beach backing is 'raised and an eiffel tower backing is lowered behind them. they both try to ignore the music, but it's impossible.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{well, you look really nice. you feeling all right?}
<A>__{as they stand in front of the eiffel tower backing, fake snow falls from above...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know it isn't like i wanted to stop seeing you. we could've carried on a fun thing for awhile. why is it you dames want all or nothing?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i don't know, we're just goofy when it comes to love... look, harry, if it's all right with you, i'd like to be friends}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm not ready to be your friend. how's that?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{fine. i understand.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{anyway, do you actually buy that horse shit.. .that men and women can be friends once they've had sex?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i'm friends with my ex husband, but then again, we didn't just have sex.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{we didn't just have sex either.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{then what was it? love to know.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{can i e mail it to you when i figure it out?}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{this is perfect. i have given the `can't we be friends' speech for 40 years. i think i invented the 'can't we be friends' speech. but you know what,now i get why they never went for it. you dames got one thing right. sometimes sex does change everything. call me crazy, but i just don't see us out on the town, being pals, having dinner, 'cause i'd bet you anything, at some point, one of us will have very unfriend like thoughts about the other then pass the bread becomes anything but pass the bread. you get what i'm saying?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you don't want to be friends.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{not "don't". can't. can't be friends. doesn't work that way.}
<P>__{(tries to calm down)}
<D>__{okay, i'm moving into another phase of this thing. i'm mad at you.}
<P>__{(realizes)}
<D>__{it almost feels good.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i think i'm mad at you too.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{excellent. 'cause i don't like thinking about you so much and worrying about how you are and if i ruined your life or...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{ you've worried about me?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yes honey, the schmuck who deserves to die, worries about you.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sometimes worrying about you feels like a full time job.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{well, doll, i'm doing fine. so you don't have to work that shift anymore.}
<A>__{again, the stage manager...}
<C>__{stage manager}
<D>__{erica, they want you to take a look at the costumes for the dancing henry's. these gonna work for you?}
<A>__{harry and erica turn and see a chorus line of balding 60 year}
<B>__{old men in hospital gowns and socks.}
