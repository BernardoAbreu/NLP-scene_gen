<A>__{a weird noise snaps catherine back to "reality." she turns just as a door opens behind her. responding to the "invitation," she moves through it.}
<L>__{interior stargher's world bathroom}
<A>__{the adult carl stargher sits at the edge of the tub, his back to us, smoking a cigarette. a white german shepherd puppy clicks across the tile floor and yips at catherine. she again hears the weird noise. a stainless steel bowl wobbles as stargher's bloody rubber gloved hands fill it with something. stargher knows she's there and isn't surprised by her presence, but he's not sure what to make of her. what to do with her. he rises and walks past her to the sink. he pulls off the gloves and washes his hands, glancing at her in the mirror. catherine cannot resist looking in the tub. she sees a dead girl, her torso sliced open. disgusted and mortified, she pulls back.}
<C>__{stargher }
<D>__{she was the first...}
<A>__{she turns, and stargher is no longer at the sink.}
<D>__{stargher (o.s.) (cont'd) didn't know what i was doing...}
<A>__{she turns, where's this voice coming from?! she steps back.}
<D>__{stargher (o.s.) (cont'd) be careful...}
<A>__{the bumps into the stainless steel bowl and it topples to the floor, spilling its contents of human organs. wobble wobble wobble. the bowl makes its now familiar noise.}
<D>__{stargher (o.s.) (cont'd) what did you do now? you make a mess?}
<A>__{and she can see him coming out of the shadows. catherine backs into a corner, fearing what will come.}
<C>__{stargher }
<D>__{i hate a mess.}
<A>__{stargher steps into a pool of light, shooshes the puppy into the hall, shuts the bathroom door, and looks right at catherine.}
<C>__{stargher }
<D>__{why are you here?}
<A>__{god almighty, what does she say? what does she tell him?!}
<C>__{stargher }
<D>__{don't lie, now...}
<A>__{scritch scritch scritch. the puppy scratches at the door and whimpers, but stargher's not about to let him back in. moving slowly, carefully, he approaches catherine.}
<C>__{stargher }
<D>__{liars will be punished.}
<A>__{catherine makes a break for the door. "playfully," stargher makes a half hearted attempt to block her, but she evades him and reaches for the knob. but the door's not there. scritch scritch scritch. she can still hear the dog, but there's no damn door. she turns: no door. no window. the girl's body and bloody remains have vanished. an overhead light flickers on, giving the room the look and feel of the cell.}
<D>__{stargher (o.s.) (cont'd) where do you think you're going?}
<A>__{catherine turns, back to the wall, calm and intimidating, stargher stands in the center regarding her with great curiosity. catherine's ready to press the sensor.}
<C>__{stargher }
<D>__{don't do that.}
<A>__{she hesitates.}
<C>__{stargher }
<D>__{if you go away, you'll never find her.}
<A>__{how did he know?}
<C>__{stargher }
<D>__{if you never find her, she dies. like the rest.}
<A>__{catherine stops and listens. she can't leave now. the path to julia has appeared.}
<C>__{stargher }
<D>__{i mean, that's why you're here, right? why you came to my happy little home?}
<A>__{he reaches for her and she flinches. expecting such behavior, stargher grins.}
<C>__{stargher }
<D>__{you're pretty. a pretty, pretty thing.}
<A>__{catherine cannot show her fear, not now. she composes herself and approaches him.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i want to help you, carl.}
<A>__{his grin broadens to a smile and he almost laughs.}
<C>__{stargher}
<D>__{help me? that's good. that's a good one.}

<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{you sound like your father.}
<A>__{he gets close to her face and sneers.}
<C>__{stargher}
<D>__{i am not like him.}
<A>__{stargher retreats into the shadows, but catherine persists.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{then help me. where is julia hickson?}
<C>__{stargher}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{maybe, because you want to.}
