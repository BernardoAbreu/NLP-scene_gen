<A>__{every city has its underbelly. if you lifted the fat dark underbelly of the sprawl this is where you'd end up. the streets here feel like alleys, clotted and tight. there are streetlights, bright ones but the light dies at its source, never makes it through the sour air down to the ground. the retro fifties look comes apart here. the people that you see and you only catch quick glimpses of them, they move like rats wear black mostly, tight fitting tech fibers. anderson's caught one of the rats, a thin bald guy in black. anderson has him pinned up against a wall. they're having some kind of exchange which consists of the guy answering none of anderson's questions, and anderson pressing him harder against the wall. finally, the guy does something odd. he lifts a finger and pulls down anderson's right lower eyelid. anderson lets him. then the guy does the same on the left. has a long look. and then nods. anderson releases him, and they go off together.}
