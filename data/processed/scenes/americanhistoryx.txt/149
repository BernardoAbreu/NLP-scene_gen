<L>__{interior bathroom – the shower}
<A>__{tight on derek. behind him, after a few seconds of water therapy, the shower curtain opens again. a naked stacey comes in from behind and wraps her arms around him. he looks over his shoulder and puts his head back under the faucet. she kisses him, erotically.}

<D>__{you do. your eyes. you will always love me, too.}
<A>__{slowly, derek turns to face stacey – knowing deep down it’s the truth. he analyzes her beautiful body. he grabs her face with one hand and cups her breast with another. she french kisses his ear and then his mouth.}
<C>__{stacey}
<D>__{i’ve missed you so much. oh god. you feel so good.}
