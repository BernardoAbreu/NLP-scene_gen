<A>__{handsome rob behind the wheel. lyle shotgun, aiming his digital camera at the exiting workers.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{i'm telling you. he claims he named it napster because his hair is so nappy underneath that cap of his. but i know the real reason. it's because i was napping when he stole the idea from me. i should've been on the cover of wired magazine.}
<C>__{handsome rob}
<D>__{would you clam up. you'd give a woodpecker a headache.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{i'm the napster.}
<C>__{handsome rob}
<D>__{okay. you're the napster. heads up: cable chick.}
<A>__{they see a female service tech getting out of her work truck. lyle zooms his camera lens in on her adelphia cable work shirt. it has becky sewn in above her right breast.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{becky. nice name. i wonder what she calls the other one.}
<C>__{handsome rob}
<D>__{and it's such a mystery why you don't have a girlfriend.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{i had a girlfriend. unfortunately even though the relationship ceased in an objective reality, it's still going on in my mind.}
<P>__{(tapping his head)}
<D>__{that woman's lived in here rent free for four years.}
<A>__{lyle takes a few more pictures of becky.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{okay. all we need now is a work shirt like this one and a service truck like that one. you think stella will be able to pull it off?}
<C>__{handsome rob}
<D>__{i have my doubts, but there's no talking to charlie.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{maybe he's been inserting his hard drive into her software. clouds the judgment.}
<C>__{handsome rob}
<D>__{he knows better than to mix business with pleasure.}
<P>__{(getting out of the car)}
<D>__{only i'm allowed to do that.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{where you going?}
<C>__{handsome rob}
<D>__{to get a work shirt and a service truck.}
<A>__{lyle watches him stroll over to becky and strike up a conversation in the parking lot. lyle can't hear what's being said, but becky smiles, and lest we forget, his name is handsome rob for a reason.}
