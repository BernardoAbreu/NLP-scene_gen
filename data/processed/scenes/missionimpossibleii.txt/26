<A>__{close photo hong kong times (interior ambrose study early dawn) its front page, except for the headlines and date, covered with stacks of paper money, banded bundled dollars piled high as a cord of wood. the amount $24 millions is written in ink over the money.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{twenty four mil..}
<A>__{ambrose's hands shift to another photo of another newspaper, the london times, this one piled high with english pounds and the written amount: 37 million pounds.}
<C>__{ambrose's voice}
<D>__{thirty seven million pounds. that's a promising bid.}
<A>__{the third photo is of the afternoon aruban, with $14 million packaged on it. ambrose, wearing a robe and seated at a glass topped table, sets this last photo on the table on top the others. he picks up nekhorvich's digital camera, removes the film disk, and snaps it into its plastic case. he places the case into an envelope (note: the same envelope seen at the track) and hands it to stamp.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{we'll need this at the track. well then. sorted.}
<A>__{stamp is seated near him. glances toward ambrose's bedroom and nyah asleep in ambrose's bed.}
<C>__{stamp}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{not everything. why do you think she's really here?}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{from her point of view or mine?}
<C>__{stamp}
<D>__{wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..the question is, do you trust her?}
<A>__{as he speaks, ambrose pulls a cigar case and a cutter out of his robe. takes a cigar out of the case and clips the end of the cigar; the razor sharp cutter decapitates the tip of the cigar like a guillotine.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{one considers her timing, of course getting nicked within a week of the plane going down. suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.}
<C>__{stamp}
<D>__{well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.}
<A>__{ambrose opens the cutter again to clean off the fragments of tobacco trapped by the cut.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{tell me, hugh. you don't exactly hang on nyah's every word and gesture, do you? fairly ratty nail, that.}
<A>__{sean touches the nail of stamp's left pinkie finger. stamp reacts by slightly withdrawing his hand.}
<C>__{stamp}
<D>__{sean..}
<A>__{with his left hand ambrose grabs stamp's left wrist.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{you're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair splitting nuance, are you?}
<C>__{stamp}
<D>__{sean, please..}
<A>__{sean pulls stamp's hand closer.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{suppose she is some sort of trojan horse sent in by imf to spy in us, why should i deny myself the pleasure of a ride or two? or don't you think i can learn more from her than she can from me?}
<A>__{ambrose twists stamp's wrist so that stamp drops to one knee trying to alleviate the pain.}
<C>__{stamp}
<P>__{(in pain)}
<D>__{i do!..}
<A>__{ambrose leans in close to stamp's face as he places the cutter around stamp's pinkie.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{now hugh, you must realize that some of us have the burden of sex to deal with..and my dear chap. i may or may not know why she thinks she's here, but i'm willing to take the risk, because hugh, i am gaging for it..}
<A>__{ambrose closes the cutter on stamp's finger and cuts the nail, just nicking the top of the finger and drawing blood. stamp cries out. ambrose tosses stamp a napkin, light his cigar and exhale.}
<C>__{ambrose }
<D>__{don't ever question my judgment again.}
