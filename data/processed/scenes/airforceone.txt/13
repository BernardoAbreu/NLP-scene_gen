<L>__{exterior streets of moscow, president's motorcade night}
<A>__{winding its way down narrow cobblestone streets onto a major thoroughfare.}
<L>__{interior presidential limousine night}
<A>__{the limousine is packed with advisers, aides, military staff, including lt. col. perkins, the keeper of the nuclear football handcuffed to his wrist. in the b.g. on the limo's television set, the larry king show indulges in its normal banter. marshall wearily rubs his temples as he stifles a yawn.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{you wanna knock of f?}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{no, no. i'm fine. what did the speaker say?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{he and the nra don't like the wording.}
<C>__{doherty}
<D>__{apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be. representative taylor is working on a compromise.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{put together a score sheet. i will make some calls.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{with all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one. your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail stravanavitch.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{i might still have a few chips left.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{we could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge. the second amendment types'll love that.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{this is a crime bill, shep. killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee. besides, shep, i told you... i don't shoot babies and i don't kiss guns.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{other way around, sir.}
<C>__{marshall}
<P>__{(realizing what he said)}
<D>__{right... christ i'm tired. do me a favor and keep me away from the press.}
<A>__{marshall's watch alarm beeps and he automatically reaches into his breast pocket, pulls out a medicine vial and downs two pills with a coffee chaser. on the t.v.}
<C>__{larry king }
<D>__{... and your reaction to the president's trip to moscow. good or bad?}
<A>__{shepherd turns up the volume.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{this is the part i wanted you to see.}
<C>__{rep. danforth }
<D>__{criminal. one of our boys died in marshall's little publicity stunt and for what? so we could claim victory over another country's problems instead of our own? and now he's got the nerve to prance around moscow gloating, while that poor boy's family is left to bury him. if i were marshall, i'd be ashamed of myself.}
<C>__{larry king}
<D>__{there you have it. harsh words for the president from michael danforth, the speaker of the house.}
<A>__{marshall mutes the television. a quiet moment.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{my opinion. we can't let him get away with that kind of language.}
<A>__{marshall considers. then decides.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{it's bait. don't take it.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{sir, the speaker of the house attacked this administration on national television. you can't afford to leave that hanging.}
<C>__{marshall}
<P>__{(ignoring shepherd)}
<D>__{did we tape the duke game?}
<C>__{aide}
<D>__{it's waiting on the plane. the ending was pretty...}
<C>__{marshall}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{please don't tell me. just for once, let me be surprised.}
