<L>__{interior rescue helicopter day}
<A>__{maggie pilots the copter, heading out toward the mountain range. gabe fiddles with some of the equipment inside. both grope for a way to start the conversation.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{this is new...}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{it's a thermal scope picks up body heat of lost hikers }
<A>__{gabe flicks it on, looks at the total absence of heat as they fly over the snow.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{still find the dead ones the old fashioned way, i guess.}
<A>__{so much for small talk. gabe is clearly uneasy watching these mountains go by. maggie breaks an awkward silence }
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{you could have said goodbye.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(shakes head)}
<D>__{if i did, i'd have to listen to you tell me one more time that it wasn't my fault.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{today especially today you get to hear it again. the harness clip broke. cold stress one in a million equipment failure. you and hal could have checked it from then till now and it still would have happened.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you did everything right }
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{ if i did everything right, susan collins would still be alive.}
<B>__{the helicopter}
<A>__{whizzes on to the ranger station a small building by an old country road. not much activity outside of some rookie climbers working out on a climbing practice wall. maggie starts to land the copter, and as she does }
<B>__{inside the copter}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{do you really believe all that? that it wasn't our fault?}
<A>__{maggie slows the rotor, her eyes on the controls. gabe's eyes are locked on her.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(turns to gabe)}
<D>__{yes. yes, i do.}
<A>__{but she answered a half beat too slow. the helicopter touches ground.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{i'm not sure what i wish more, maggie. that you meant what you said, just now or that it were really true then.}
