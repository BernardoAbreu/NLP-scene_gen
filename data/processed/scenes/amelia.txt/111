<L>__{exterior miami airport day}
<A>__{long angle. from the open door of a hangar we see amelia and george facing reporters in front of the idling electra. she sits on the wing, he's just beneath her.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{the radio problems crept up on us over time.}
<A>__{superimpose: miami airport. june 1.}
<D>__{george (v.o.) (cont’d) the marine 500 kilocycle radio was left in oakland. amelia said she}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{and fred were both amateurs at morse code, so the radio wasn't worth what it weighed.}
<A>__{amelia has made the boys laugh. george laughs with them.}
<D>__{george (v.o.) (cont’d) the 250 foot trailing auxiliary antenna, she would leave behind in miami. too heavy, not important.}
<A>__{flashes now. and plenty of them. she reaches down to take george's hand and hops down from the wing. more flashes...}
<D>__{george (v.o.) (cont’d) then, suddenly our remaining radio couldn't reach its designated frequencies. pan am hurriedly replaced the main antennae. and we thought all was well.}
<A>__{amelia and george coming toward us now, hand in hand, leaving the press behind. into... the hangar. in shadow here. the world far away, she takes his hands. a silence.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{race you to california. i will go west. five bucks?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{if you'll fly the plane. make it twenty.}
<A>__{and then...}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{simpkin keeps many mice at one time. each under a different teacup.}
<A>__{wow. he's finally going to hear this.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{we're saying he's cruel?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{controlling?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{insecure.}
<A>__{ah. the light begins to dawn.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{he needs the illusion of activity to feel comfortable. that he's preparing for all contingencies.}
<A>__{george has to grin.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{that he has more irons in the fire than anyone knows.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{especially the mice.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{exactly. each poor mouse thinks it's all about her.}
<A>__{staring at each other.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{and one of them. is right.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{she knows.}
<A>__{and then...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i want you to give me something.}
<A>__{he’s never sounded quite like this before.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{tell me this is your last flight.}
<A>__{her eyes flicker. look down. a whispered...}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{promise.}
<A>__{and when the eyes come up.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{don’t you know i couldn’t? even if part of me wanted to. very, very much.}
<A>__{the look holds.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{how can we be anything. but what we are?}
<A>__{there is no answer. she leans up into a slow kiss.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{i do love you.}
<A>__{something in her serious face makes him smile.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, i love you back.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{takes a step back toward the hangar door. one hand slightly up, stay here. then, the smile he's waited for.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{see ya.}
<A>__{he smiles back. she turns and heads out toward the idling plane. she seems small, even fragile, alone on the tarmac. stay with george. watching her go.}
