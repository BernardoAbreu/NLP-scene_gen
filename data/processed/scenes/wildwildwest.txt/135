<L>__{exterior stream dusk}
<A>__{west and gordon, caked in mud, are coming up a ridge, below which is a stream.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{all right, gordon, what's your plan? how are you gonna get this damn thing off my neck?}
<A>__{gordon turns to west, simmering, controlling himself.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{isn't that why you're here? 'cause you're the master of, you know, mechanical stuff?}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{oh. oh, i see. now i'm the master of... 'mechanical stuff.' as opposed to five minutes ago, when i was trying to collect my thoughts and figure out a way to get us out of these contraptions! but no!}
<A>__{gordon starts moving towards west, who is forced to back up looking a tad nervous for the first time in the movie.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{ that wouldn't have been any fun for a certain somebody, and i won't mention any names jim west! who decided to take me on a bracing romp through a cornfield and play a fanciful game of hide and seek with serrated, spinning death discs, while our only mode of transportation is in the hands of a sadistic madman with weapons of mass destruction, who kidnapped rita, and is on his way to kill our president and take over the country!}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{hey, calm down, gordon...}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(he's completely lost it)}
<D>__{no! because i'm the 'master of mechanical stuff!' and i have to help you! because you're the 'master of stupid stuff!'}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{gordon...}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{you want to get that collar off? fine! let's do it the fun, jim west way!}
<P>__{(picks up a rock)}
<D>__{let's bash it with a rock!}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{gordon, you don't want to do that.}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(crazy)}
<D>__{oh, but i do.}
<A>__{gordon grabs a rock and smashes west's collar. suddenly ziiiinng! west's collar emits a low hum. suddenly, west is thrown into gordon, their collars locking. clang!}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(suddenly calm)}
<D>__{that's odd. what did you do?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i didn't do shit!}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{no, you must've reversed the polarity of the magnets.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i did not do shit!}
<P>__{(he's had enough)}
<D>__{that's it }
<A>__{west lifts his leg to gordon's collar to push him away, but then clang! the stiletto in his shoe dislodges and instantly sticks to gordon's magnetic collar. for a mega millisecond, west his foot stuck to his partner's neck is stunned. but before he knows what even happened, west flips upside down onto his shoulders.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{oh, i'm peachey. now help me get my boot off!}
<A>__{first, gordon trying to get some leverage puts his foot in west's crotch and pulls the boot.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{ahhhh!}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{apologies, apologies.}
<A>__{gordon struggles to free the writhing west from the boot (attached to gordon's collar). finally, west's foot comes free. but when he sits up thwap! his collar is sucked into gordon's belt buckle. west is face to face with his partner's crotch.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{do me a favor. when you're telling this story to your grandkids, leave this part out.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{don't worry.}
<A>__{west starts unbuttoning gordon's belt.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{now, when i undo your belt, i'm going to run as fast as i can that way, and you run as fast as you can the other way. understand?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{you're going to run as fast as you can one way and i'm going to run as fast as i can the other...? ingenious.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{one... two...}
<P>__{(undos belt)}
<D>__{three!}
<A>__{the men run in opposite directions. (gordon's belt on west's collar, west's boot on gordon's). they get about thirty, forty yards. then they're yanked backwards into each other. splash! they fall in the water back to back. every time one rolls up and catches his breath, the other is under water.}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(rolling face up)}
<D>__{get off me, you steaming pile of}
<P>__{(gurgle)!}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(rolling face up)}
<D>__{i'm trying, you son of a (gurgle)!}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(rolling face upgurgle) you!}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(rolling face upgurgle) yourself!}
<A>__{finally they roll out of the stream and onto dry land. they sit up, out of breath, stuck together, back to back.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i do not want to spend the rest of my life looking like a meatball on a plate.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{we're going to have to discuss bathroom etiquette soon. very soon.}
<B>__{angle on tool kit}
<A>__{bobbing in the stream. gordon grabs it out of the water.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{aha. my auxiliary tool kit. i forgot all about it. it must've slipped out of my pocket.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{your pocket? why wasn't it attached to some spring loaded something or other that shoots out of your ass?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{because that, my friend, would be uncomfortable.}
