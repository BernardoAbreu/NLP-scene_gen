<L>__{interior keating's classroom day}
<A>__{the students are all back in their normal seats and keating leaps up onto his desk.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{why do i stand up here? anybody?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{to feel taller.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{keating rings the bell on his desk with his foot}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{thank you for playing, mr. dalton. i stand upon my desk to remind yourself that we must constantly look at things in a different way.}
<A>__{keating glances around the classroom from atop the desk.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{you see, the world looks very different from up here. you don't believe me? come see for yourself. come on. come on!}
<A>__{charlie and neil quickly rise from their seats to go to the front of the classroom. the rest of the class follows them. while keating continues speaking, neil and charlie join him on the desk and then keating jumps down.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{just when you think you know something, you have to look at it in another way. even though it may seem silly or wrong, you must try! now, when you read, don't just consider what the author thinks. consider what you think.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{boys, you must strive to find your own voice. because the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all. thoreau said, "most men lead lives of quiet desperation." don't be resigned to that. break out!}
<A>__{keating notices spaz and another boy leaving the desk immediately.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{don't just walk off the edge like lemmings. look around you.}
<A>__{the school bell rings as the boys continue to climb onto the desk. keating begins to gather up his stuff. the clock begins to toll as keating walks to the back of the class.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{there! there you go, mr. priske. thank you! yes! dare to strike out and find new ground. now, in addition to your essays, i would like you to compose a poem of your own, an original work.}
<A>__{the students begin to groan. keating begins flickering the lights off and on while chanting ominously.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{that's right! you have to deliver it aloud in front of the class on monday. bonne chance, gentlemen.}
<A>__{keating steps out into the hall before quickly peeking back in once again. todd is the last one to stand on the desk and is about to jump off.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{mr. anderson? don't think that i don't know that this assignment scares the hell out of you, you mole.}
<A>__{keating flicks the light off, leaving todd to jump down in the darkness as the students laugh.}
