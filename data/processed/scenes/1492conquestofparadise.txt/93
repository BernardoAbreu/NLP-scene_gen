<L>__{exterior sea night}
<A>__{we are in the middle of a violent storm of terrifying proportions. the thunder is deafening. light irradiates the darkness. we see the two caravels, dwarfed by the massive seas.}
<L>__{exterior deck night}
<A>__{five men are struggling to lash down the tiller. the deck jumps and rolls. it rises five meters into the air then falls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack. waves sweep over the decks. we hear desperate cries for mercy from the terrified crew, loud enough to be heard above the storm. columbus and mendez are crawling towards the mast, along a lifeline.}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(screaming to the sailors)}
<D>__{get below! all of you! go!}
<A>__{the men start to scramble below decks.}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(to mendez)}
<D>__{stay with me!}
<A>__{the ship rolls again. columbus and mendez crawl towards the mast. another gigantic wave crashes over them, tons of water falling like cement. they reach the mast. the wood groans.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{we may have to cut it!}
<A>__{mendez nods... columbus grabs some rope. the ship rises into the air again, crashes down, the deck disappearing beneath them for a moment.}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(screaming out)}
<D>__{i will stay here to decide if we cut it. help me!}
<A>__{with mendez's help, columbus is tied to the mast: one rope under his arms, the other around his waist. mendez hands him a horn.}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{now go!}
<A>__{mendez seems to hesitate. columbus screams at him again.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{i said below deck, mendez!}
<A>__{mendez crawls away. another huge wave washes over columbus. he emerges, almost suffocated. the storm rages, its eerie light making it seem at times like bright daylight. but as the lightning flashes, columbus begins to count:}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{one... two... three... four...}
<A>__{there's an enormous thunderclap on "four" it indicates how close they are to the eye of the storm. the ship keels over again, dropping down and down, seeming never to rise... columbus lifts his head to the heavens, screams out:}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{damn you!}
<A>__{as if in answer, another flash of lightning that illuminates the sky and the sea. columbus starts counting again.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{one... two... three... four... five...}
<A>__{another terrible clap of thunder on "five" columbus starts laughing, knowing the storm is moving on. then, in the strange light, something seems to move through the air towards him; it looks like some kind of projectile, a craft, with a trail of vapor. columbus stares up at it... amazed. we start to hear the "te deum", majestic and heavenly.}
