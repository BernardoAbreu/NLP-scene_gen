<L>__{interior tea room a moment later evening}
<A>__{vicki at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared as hell. the overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark. the joker saunters over and pulls up a chair.}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{i think it's safe to take that off.}
<A>__{vicki recognizes the deranged smile instantly. she removes the gas mask, tries to gather her wits.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{you're quite beautiful.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{... thank you.}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{unfortunate, but i think we can work around it.}
<A>__{he sets a couple of candlesticks on the table and reaches for his lighter. a long jet of flame shoots out, jerry lewis style, as he lights the candles.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{you're vicki vale. i guess you know who i am. is this your portfolio?}
<A>__{she nods. he opens it, begins leafing through the record of vicki's career. newspaper photos from the globe, at first. then fashion layouts, magazine covers of celebrities. artier b&amp;w shots from vicki's first couple of exhibitions.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{crap. crap. crap, crap, crap... ahhh. now here's what caught my eye.}
<A>__{he's come to the combat photos from corto maltese.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{the panic. the bloody skulls. the armless screaming fellows... you know, the atrocities.}
<P>__{(smirking)}
<D>__{somehow, when you shoot it, it all comes out so clean, so lovely.}
<A>__{vicki is squirming, but she doesn't think it wise to debate the pointerior not with this lunatic, anyway.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{i guess i'm just an old cornball, but... i live for beauty. i look around at my little city, it gets me down.}
<P>__{(indicating the photos)}
<D>__{we don't have anything like this. well, it came to me that what this city needs... is beautification. kind of a big makeover.}
<P>__{(enraptured)}
<D>__{miss vale, i finally realized that one man can make a difference. you know the saying. "in his image... created he them"?}
<A>__{vicki gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary, getting more frightened by the minute.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{and you want a }
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{a visual record, yes. a before and after kind of thing.}
<P>__{(leaning closer)}
<D>__{this could make your reputation.}
<A>__{her first impulse is to get up and run. but she fights the impulse. she won't run... not until she gets this maniac on film. she reaches for her camera bag.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist. people might like to see the face behind the makeup.}
<C>__{joker}
<P>__{(momentarily puzzled)}
<D>__{... behind the makeup?}
<A>__{then it sinks in. by candlelight, in the darkened restaurant, with his pancake makeup and his black rinse job, he looks practically normal. vicki must think she's looking at his real face!}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{oh. yes. i see what you mean.}
<A>__{he finds a pitcher, pours a glass of water, and very carefully sets it on the table in front of vicki. then suddenly, inexplicably he barks at her:}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{silly little twit i can't take you anywhere!}
<A>__{he sits back and grins expectantly. vicki is thoroughly nonplussed by this bizarre outburst. a moment passes. he obviously wants her to do something, but she hasn't got a clue as to what it is. growing impatient now, he points at the water glass:}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{well? what are you waiting for??}
<A>__{now vicki gets the pointerior she picks up the glass and hurls its contents in the joker's face. his hands go up. he writhes. he shrieks like the wicked witch of the west dissolving. he reaches for a napkin to wipe his face clean... and begins to cackle. his awful white and green clown's face revealed behind the running makeup, he leers at her.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{you see, miss vale that was my makeup.}
<P>__{(leaning forward)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{vicki is repulsed, but she's determined to tough it out.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i've seen worse. much worse.}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{strong stomach, huh? i like that in a woman. maybe we can do business after all.}
<A>__{he seems to have calmed down a bit. it's almost as if he's coming on to her. but just then, a tiny bell sounds behind them... and a voice intrudes:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{jack?}
<A>__{the joker turns. alicia steps out of a rooftop elevator and moves toward them, drugged, wraithlike. she's still wearing the porcelain doll's mask we saw earlier.}
<C>__{joker}
<P>__{(to vicki)}
<D>__{christ, it's my girlfriend.}
<P>__{(to alicia)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{alicia}
<D>__{you said i could look at the pictures before you before you }
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{shucks, honey, i forgot.}
<P>__{(rolling his eyes at vicki)}
<D>__{i'm in trouble now.}
<P>__{(to alicia)}
<D>__{this is business, sweetie. why don't you go outside and see how the boys are coming?}
<A>__{vicki can't take her eyes off this strange figure drifting eerily through the abandoned tea room.}
<C>__{vicki}
<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{... why the mask?}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{alicia! come here, have a seat. show miss vale why you wear the mask.}
<A>__{alicia sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{you see, miss vale, alicia's beautiful. one in a million. a work of art. in fact...}
<A>__{we're looking at alicia's profile as the mask comes off. the side that's turned to us is indeed beautiful. but the side we can't see... sends vicki right over the edge.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{she makes you look sick.}
<A>__{vicki lurches out of her seat, knocking it over, her face frozen in horror. she finds her camera, holds it out like a weapon as the joker advances on her.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{you scum! you sick filth!... you did that to her!}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{what? i improved her a little...}
<A>__{vicki backs away, snapping the shutter on her camera. he blinks as the flash gun goes off repeatedly.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i will see you burn. i will see you dead. get away from me!!}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{miss vale, was it something i said?}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{do you want to sniff my flower?}
<A>__{there's a bright purple boutonniere in his lapel. he holds it up for vicki's inspection as he moves menacingly closer.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{the joker squeezes a concealed bulb. a jet of clear liquid spurts out of the flower, narrowly missing vicki. she gasps. bumps into a table. acrid black smoke rises from the floor where the clear liquid hit. acid.}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{come on, miss vale... stop and smell the roses!!}
<A>__{he backs vicki into a corner. and then abruptly a skylight shatters in a hail of glass! a caped shadow drops to the floor of the restaurant! and the joker is face to face with... the batman! on his wrist is a steel gauntlet. ha aims it at the joker like a weapon. then pivots suddenly points his arm through the door of the restaurant and fires a metal spike into the adobe wall of the ramp outside!!}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{... you!!}
<A>__{on the end of the spike is a cord leading to batman's belt. in the wink of an eye he's grabbed vicki dragged her out of the tea room and plunged over the ramp wall, four stories straight down to the atrium floor below!!! the joker races to the edge of the ramp.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{get 'em!! get 'em!!}
<A>__{his goons are stationed at various points along the ramp, still defacing masterpieces. they pull their guns and open fire as batman and vicki plummet past. angle on batman and vicki as they fall he holds the gauntlet overhead, rope whistling through it. as we watch, the gauntlet sprouts steel wings forming a bulletproof shield over their heads! two feet above the marble floor, the rope jerks them up short like a bunjee cord. guns blaze as batman and vicki drop safely to earth and make for the exit. the doors are locked. batman spots the black "closed" sign on a metal stand. he heaves it through the glass doors. vicki hustles through. he points her to a side alley.}
