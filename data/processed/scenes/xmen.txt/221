<A>__{where the flame of the torch once stood, now stands logan, his skeleton cooling down. logan leans on the torchis railing, his chest bleeds from the six claw wounds. logan is exhausted. he looks down at his comrades still trapped by the metal bands. and magneto lying powerless on the floor. suddenly, from below a massive clawed hand strikes logan's chest. the blow sends logan sailing back to the far end of the torch. logan lies against the railing. opening his eyes he sees two clawed feet following upward to a very angry, very large sabretooth, towering over him. sabretooth leaps at logan. against the new york skyline they go at it, slashing and howling.}
