<A>__{a large dropcloth is over the dining room table and chairs. it is neatly folded back at one end, leaving one chair and place setting uncovered. a small portable color tv is next to the place setting. chance enters, puts his laundry bag on a covered table near the doorway. he sits at the dining room table, turns on the tv, and carefully unfolds his napkin, puts it on his lap as he watches the screen. louise, an elderly black maid, enters with a tray of food and chance's clean laundry.}
