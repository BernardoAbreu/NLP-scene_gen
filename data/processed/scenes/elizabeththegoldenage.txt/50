<L>__{44a b 44a b interior queen's private quarters day}
<A>__{multiple images of elizabeth, naked. strange misty refracted glimpses of her face, her body. a bath of steaming hot water has been placed in the queen's private quarters, and screened by mirrors. the queen is in the bath, being washed by her ladies. bess throckmorton has the job of holding the queen's hair out of the water as she's washed. she strokes the soft tresses as she holds them, unaware that elizabeth can see her in the mirror. then she looks up and catches elizabeth's eyes, and stops in confusion.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{no, don't stop. i like it.}
<A>__{bess returns to her gentle caresses, and elizabeth to her thoughts.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{is it true, bess? that i've never known the simple pleasure of being liked for myself?}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{i hope you believe that i like you for yourself, my lady.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{is anybody ever liked just for themselves? are you? i doubt it. men like you because you're pretty. and because you have the ear of the queen.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{no doubt, my lady.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{him too. he likes you because he wants my favour. you do realise that?}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{yes, my lady.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{and the other thing too, of course. but all men want that. male desire confers no distinction.}
<A>__{ess strokes elizabeth's hair in silence. then she sees elizabeth gazing at her in the mirror.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i envy you, bess. you're free to have what i can't have. you're my adventurer. don't be afraid. it's all over so soon.}
