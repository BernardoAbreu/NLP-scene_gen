<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{she emerges, moves to wills' door, and waits for the elevator to close. when it does, she hurries back to a table over which hangs a gilded mirror. she takes a lovely old hat box out of the garbage bag and ditches the bag under the table. then she quickly checks herself in the glass. she doesn't like what she sees. she pokes at her sopping hair and squeezes it, but it's hopeless. remembering the time, she hurries back to the door, takes a deep breath, and rings the bell. she waits. and waits. then she hears footsteps approaching. she realizes she's left the hat box on the table. she rushes over and grabs it, just in time to get back to the door when it opens. olivia, the housekeeper, steps out, wearing her coat and carrying her purse. her voice is low and gentle }
