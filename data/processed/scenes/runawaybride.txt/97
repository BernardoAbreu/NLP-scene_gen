<C>__{grandma julia }
<A>__{i'd like to explain about the weddings. there are reasons why they didn't come off. three weddings, no "i do's". you can't believe how much cake we were left with. i should weigh three hundred pounds. i don't think her father minded spending so much money on booze that nobody drank. we hear grandma as through the hotel doors, we see maggie exit the diner. she gets a bag from inside the cab of her truck and comes inside the hotel where she finds ike talking to grandma, who is having tea with her friend, netta.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{ike... hi, grandma.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.}
<C>__{grandma julia}
<A>__{right, cover your ears, netta. it's not that she's afraid of the wedding, she's afraid of the wedding night. innocent girls are terrified of "the one eyed snake".}
<P>__{(getting into it)}
<A>__{why, when i was a virgin bride, i took a knitting needle with me into the bed... ike winces.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{actually, grandma, i charmed the one eyed snake awhile ago.}
<C>__{grandma julia}
<A>__{oh, yeah, i forgot. i will tell you one thing, your grandpa didn't forget that wedding night.}
<P>__{(no netta)}
<A>__{you can take your hands off your ears, netta. your tea's getting cold.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{can you excuse us a minute?}
<P>__{(then to ike)}
<A>__{may i have a word with you, please? maggie moves toward door.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{bye, netta... bye, grandam. he steps over to maggie in the doorway.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i found this and didn't know if it was something interesting. maggie hands ike a 30 year old lp: miles davis' "kind of blue."}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(excited)}
<A>__{oh, my god it's miles davis. this is "king of blue"! this is the original recording. hard to find in good condition. where did you find this?}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(casual)}
<A>__{it was in the attic. it was jus sitting there gathering dust.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{it's valuable. hang onto it.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{no. you take it. she steps outside, leaving ike with the record.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{hmmm... figuring out what kind of music i like and then finding me a rare album. you're not trying to soften me up, are you?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{no i'm cleaning an attic. i wouldn't attempt the impossible. she turns and walks back to the diner where mrs. pressman is outside watering plants. ike looks after maggie and then back down at the record in his hand. somehow it makes him sad.}
