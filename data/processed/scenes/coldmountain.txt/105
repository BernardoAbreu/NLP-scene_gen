<L>__{exterior veasey town. day}
<A>__{the home guard escort the prisoners past veasey's old church. more days have gone by and taken their toll on the prisoners, veasey and inman are haggard and filthy and reduced. the home guards stop for food, a wash, a break, chain the prisoners to a horse rail. citizens go by, veasey knows them all. some of them spit contemptuously at the deserters. none of them recognise veasey.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{am i so altered that they don't see me?}
<A>__{somebody walks by with a young child. veasey looks at inman.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{i christened that child.}
<A>__{the child stops, looks without recognizing, is tugged away from the chain gang by his mother. one of the other prisoners, sheffield, leans in to inman, his voice low.}
<C>__{sheffield}
<D>__{i'm looking to get out of this. they drag us back to fight we're just target practice for the federal boys.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{you run, we're all running with you, the lame and the stupid, of which we number both.}
<C>__{sheffield}
<D>__{either way we're fucked. run or don't run.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{just give me some warning so i can tell the guard i'm not getting shot again for some cause i don't believe in.}
<A>__{a group of slaves are walking by, carrying sacks. one of the women is pregnant. veasey studies the group, sees the pregnant woman, recognizes her.}
<C>__{veasey}
<P>__{(mesmerized)}
<D>__{that's rebecca. that's rebecca.}
<P>__{(he hisses)}
<D>__{rebecca!}
<A>__{in daylight it's apparent that rebecca is a real beauty. she turns at the sound of her name, stops, is confused. she sees veasey and approaches, appalled at his condition.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{mas?}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{is it well with you?}
<P>__{(rebecca nods)}
<D>__{i've been repenting for what i did. i've walked the road of atonement.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{your curls is all gone.}
<B>__{the guard kicks him.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{veasey}
<P>__{(holding his head, to rebecca)}
<D>__{god bless you.}
<A>__{rebecca, reluctant, rejoins the other slaves, walks away with them, but then turns back to look at veasey. she clearly cares about him. and seeing her has somehow broken his heart. he turns away from inman, towards sheffield.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{i'm with you. i got a baby coming.}
