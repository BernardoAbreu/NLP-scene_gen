<D>__{why do you consider me your enemy?}
<A>__{redford frowns. he says in disbelief:}

<A>__{sam runs up to redford and pokes him as hard as he can in the scissor cut with his finger. redford screams. scouts and scout masters everywhere stop what they are doing and look to the chapel tent. across the compound, commander pierce comes out of his tent, alerted. sam whips the binoculars out of redford's hands, turns away, and sprints. no one moves anywhere except sam dashing toward the marina. redford shouts at the top of his lungs:}

<A>__{an emergency alarm sounds. the entire camp swings into action. two teams of scouts playing capture the flag descend from both sides and cut sam off from the dock. they wear red and yellow jerseys over their uniforms. suzy jumps out of the boat onto the dock. sam sees her beyond the blockade of scouts. she waves her arms. sam throws up his hands. he sprints in a new direction, onto a wide field. there is a small, pink flag on a thin stick stuck in the ground at the center of a plastic ring. sam grabs it as he runs past. he looks back and sees: a mob of fifty scouts chasing him. he circles in a giant figure eight trailed by the huge group. he races up a hill and stops at the top. sam looks down at the approaching scouts and hundreds of others watching. a dark cloud rolls in casting a giant shadow over the entire camp. sam throws the little flag down at his pursuers like a javelin. it sails in an arc and pokes down into the grass. there is a thunderclap. sam looks up into the sky. a bolt of lightning strikes him. sam is thrown ten feet through the air and lands on his back. the tennis ball can explodes nickels. the mob of scouts stops with a jolt. they look terrified. sam sits up. he is covered in black soot. his shoes are on fire. he shakes them off his feet. suzy runs through the crowd of scouts and drops down on her knees in front of sam. she looks astonished. sam says}
