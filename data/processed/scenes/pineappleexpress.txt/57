<A>__{dale holds the un lit joint as saul takes the pot and the money.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{and we, my good man, are officially scott fuckin' free.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{there are still people trying to kill us.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{but at least now we can afford to run. i'm gonna go buy some celebration snacks. let's have us a little mardi gras fiesta.}
<A>__{saul laughs as he puts on his backpack and walks around the corner. dale re lights the remaining roach and casually smokes. he blows some smoke rings, coughs a bit, stretches; for a few moments, looking completely relaxed, but then a cop car screeches to a halt right in front of dale! a female police liaison officer (who is not carol) gets out of the car. dale freezes in horror.}
<C>__{police liaison}
<D>__{don't move!}
<A>__{she walks towards dale. he seems prepared to run, but she places her hand on a can of pepper spray.}
<C>__{police liaison }
<D>__{don't move! this stuff hurts. what's in your hand?}
<C>__{dale.}
<D>__{i'm sorry, ma'am. it's weed. i will get rid of it right away, i was just smoking this. i...i thought it was decriminalized. or something. for medical purposes. i have epilepsy.}
<C>__{police liaison}
<D>__{selling pot to my students isn't "decriminalized." i'm the liaison officer for this school and i just caught four students showing off handfuls of marijuana to their friends. they told me they got it back here. put your hands up.}
<A>__{she cuffs dale's hands behind him!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{wait! i wasn't selling anything! all i have is this little jointerior}
<A>__{police liaison takes the large joint out of dale's hand.}
<C>__{police liaison}
<D>__{you call this little?}
<A>__{she throws it on the ground and smears it around with her foot.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i don't even have any money! how did i sell weed if i don't have any money?!? i was just smoking it. i swear. please.}
<A>__{she pats him down, finding only his wallet. the police liaison sees he only has nine dollars. she pulls out his driver's license.}
<C>__{police liaison}
<D>__{it's possible you're telling the truth. i'm going to run a check and if it turns out you don't have any priors and all you've got is this small amount of marijuana, i will let you go with a fine. take a seat.}
<A>__{she walks towards her car as dale sits on the ground. angle on: saul saul merrily turns into the alley holding two red slurpees, when he jumps back in terror! he sees the cop car up the alley. he ducks back behind the corner.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{they got dale. oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck...}
<A>__{angle on: dale and the police liaison she looks at her car computer. the screen reads: dale denton: outstanding warrant double hit and run. she looks back at dale and types into her computer.}
