<L>__{exterior manor house gardens day}
<A>__{the gardens are sun drenched, bursting with the beauty of a french summer. athos finds phillippe there, sitting alone.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{recent hours have been a shock.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{perhaps not as much as you might imagine. when tutors answered every question except those about who i was. when i was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, i knew there was something different about me. but a king...}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{phillippe... there is something i hope you understand. terrible cruelty has been used against you. and... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{there is... wrath... in me. i have learned to hide it. those years in the cell, i dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened. now i am free. and with each free breath i feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all i lost. look at this, all this that for ten years i could not see! what if i become a king a king no different from my brother?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{the desire for vengeance... can be a poison.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{what is its antidote?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.}
<A>__{phillippe reaches to a flower, plucks it, and smells it. he looks around at the beauty of the garden, taking it all in. athos looks around too; then athos realizes phillippe is no longer looking at the garden, but at him.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{you look so sad. is it something i have done?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{it is something i have done or did not do.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.}
<A>__{before phillippe can pursue this, athos turns businesslike.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{we have much to do, we'd best get started. now suppose you were to walk into a garden, as a king...}
