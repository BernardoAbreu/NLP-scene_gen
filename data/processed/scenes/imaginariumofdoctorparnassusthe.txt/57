<L>__{int ext the mind of dr. parnassus that moment}
<A>__{terrified, anton and the screaming sally are spun through a black void clinging desperately to an asteroid as planets and stars spin madly around them. blood red lightning bolts crackle and crash. chaos.}
<L>__{ext outside pub that moment}
<A>__{out front, the crowd, larger now, is reacting badly to the dreadful screams. sally's friends try to storm the stage. tony and percy try to hold them back.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{please. everything's alright. it's okay. really. i promise you.}
<A>__{a middle aged woman hits him with her handbag. tony and percy are in danger of being overwhelmed. we can still hear sally screaming from somewhere within the stage.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen. ladies and gentlemen....please...}
<A>__{a drunk takes a swing at percy, misses, and connects with}
<B>__{tony.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{ugh!}
<A>__{he falls off the stage and disappears into the angry crowd who begin pummelling and kicking him. percy, desperate, produces a pistol and fires a couple of shots into the air. everyone dives for cover. percy, taking advantage of the temporary lull, begins to race around, untying, unhooking, and pulling on ropes. the theatre begins to close up as the horses bolt and the wagon clatters off down the street, bits falling off as it goes.}
<C>__{voice in crowd}
<D>__{somebody call the police!}
<A>__{a battered tony, chased by the enraged crowd,just manages to clamber on board, with the help of valentina. the wagon narrowly succeeds in out pacing the fastest of the crowd. as it disappears down the street, a figure is dumped unceremoniously out through the back door of the wagon. it's the terrified sally, sent sprawling in the middle of the road. a figure steps out from the shadows to help her to her feet. it's mr. nick in his bowler and red waistcoat.}
