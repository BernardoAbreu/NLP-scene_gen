<A>__{surge down the tunnel like a pack of hungry wolves on high octane. there must be a dozen of them now and quinn is right in the lead. our trio hustles along, but whistler stumbles, tumbling and sliding down a washout. the steep incline of the washout makes it virtually impossible for whistler to climb back up to the main tunnel.}
