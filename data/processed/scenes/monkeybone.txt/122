<A>__{the party he's addressing is stu who's stretched out horizontally, strapped to a medieval torture rack, with a whole posse of grim reapers standing guard around him.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{you're mad at me. great. you have every right to be. but we're both mad at dark town. we're both mad at hypnos.}

<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i'm not going to tell you that. i wanted that e ticket. i wanted it so bad i'd stare you right in the face to get it and i'd do the same again.}
