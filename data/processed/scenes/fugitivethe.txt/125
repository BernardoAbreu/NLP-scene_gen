<A>__{kimble splashes blindly through ankle deep sluice. he slows at forking tunnels to catch his breath and pick a direction. a dull roar comes from somewhere from everywhere. he whips off his jacket and slings it down a tunnel, then continues straight ahead. somewhere behind, lights probe splash patterns on the conduit wall telltale signs of kimble's passing. the lights belong to... gerard, biggs and renfro. they push on, soon reaching the forking tunnels. renfro finds the jacket ant splash signs.}
