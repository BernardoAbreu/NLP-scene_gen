<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{captain of soldiers}
<A>__{stares up at robin defiantly.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{spare your breath. i know nothing.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(reasonable)}
<D>__{i believe you. but this arab here, he's got it into his barbarian brain that you know a whole lot more than nothing.}
<C>__{robin }
<D>__{and when he gets like this, he's very hard to reason with.}
<A>__{with a hair raising war cry, aslan leaps into view. stripped to the waist, brandishing his scimitar. the captain tries to back away. robin tries to restrain aslan, is hurled aside. snarling, drooling at the mouth, aslan explores the captain's body with his hands. a butcher checking meat.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i strongly advise you to talk. he hasn't eaten in weeks.}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(rising terror)}
<D>__{what does he want?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{for godsakes, get him off me!}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(very deliberately)}
<D>__{no, aslan... not this one, aslan. ... how about this other one?... fatter, yes... more meat.}
<A>__{the other soldier, who definitely has more flesh on the bone, is struck dumb with horror, as aslan turns his attention to him. with one swing of his sword, aslan slices through the man's ropes. drags him to his feet. little john runs over.}
<C>__{little john}
<P>__{(urgent)}
<D>__{no, robin, no! they be god fearin' men.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i cannot stop him, john. besides, if they will not tell what they know, then they must pay the price.}
<C>__{little john}
<D>__{kill 'em aye, but not like this. 'tain't christian.}
<A>__{blood curdling screams from behind the wagon where aslan has dragged his victim. the captain's face pales. then silence. the demented arab slowly reappears. blood drips from his lips. he munches the flesh from a long bone, on the end of which is the soldier's glove... the man's arm. turning to robin, aslan shouts in arabic and gesticulates wildly at the captain.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{what does he say?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{well, roughly, he says that he doesn't care for the way your friend tastes, and he wants you.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{no, god, no! i will talk. just keep him away. keep him away!}
<B>__{behind wagon}
<A>__{bull holds the other prisoner, muffling the man's mouth and trying to suppress his own laughter. beside them lies a large chunk of venison. the man is unharmed, except that he's missing a glove.}
