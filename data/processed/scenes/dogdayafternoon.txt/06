<A>__{it is parked in a drab brooklyn street. beside the car stands sal, medium height, also good looking in an intense boyish way. his eyes dart about suspiciously, the ever watchful sal. there is a watchful reserve in sal that contrasts to sonny's outgoing bounciness: first impression is sonny is all bark; sal is the bite. sal is dressed in impressive blue suit style, he looks like a kid trying to impress the godfather. he even wears a hat. now, matching sal's preparations inside the car, he checks his tie's alignment, shoots his cuffs and is ready... meanwhile, on their car radio:}

<B>__{another angle by car}
<A>__{as he turns, from the back of the car, jackie appears with a huge florist box, tied with ribbon. jackie is an eighteen year old with bad complexion and in contrast to sonny and sal is dressed in teenage sloppiness. adidas, t shirt, bowling jacket, jeans. he is uncertain: waits for directions from sonny. sonny takes the florist box from him. we see a water truck drive down the street, followed by sonny's car, which drives up near bank. it stops, jackie gets out, crosses to bank window, peers through, then}
<B>__{angle inside car}
<A>__{returns to car. leans in, has fake conversation with sonny. they are waiting. sonny checks his watch, turns to sal in back seat:}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{30 seconds, sal...}
<A>__{they wait. at appropriate moment, sal exits car, walks toward bank. slowly sonny gets out.}
