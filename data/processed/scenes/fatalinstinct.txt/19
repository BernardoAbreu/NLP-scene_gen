<A>__{sunlight creeps through the windows. lana's eyes flutter open. she sees ned beside her... sleeping. suddenly, it hits her. she turns! frank is on the other side, curled up, snoring. she's laying between both men! lana elbows frank. he stirs, groggy. she covers his mouth... indicating ned. frank's eyes bug out! he slips out of bed. the bed frame squeaks loudly! frank freezes. ned sleeps on steadily. frank grabs his clothes. an unending torrent of coins fall out of his pants pockets, clanging on the floor! he freezes. ned sleeps on. frank retrieves the coins, clumsily stepping on the tv remote control. a high tech, sleekly designed television monitor rises up... clicks on. frank tries frantically to push the set down, but it keeps rising into position. an image appears. it's willard scott, doing the weather on the today show. frank grabs the remote control, frantically pounding on all the buttons. the volume goes up... sound blasting!}

<D>__{...and mrs. prudy ann camomile of delphi, georgia is one hundred and thirteen! what a gorgeous hunk of female! smokes three cigars a day, drinks a straight shot of vodka at bedtime... and still has sex!}
<A>__{the alarm clock goes off, clanging loudly! lana dives for it, slamming her hand down, killing the alarm. going for a double play, she flings the clock at the tv, nailing the on off switch! silence. ned is still out cold. frank moves toward the door... but with each step the floor creaks loudly! he turns the knob. it clunks! he pulls the door open v e r y s l o w l y and it cre e e e a k s like the piercing metal brakes of a train! he blows lana a kiss, then pulls the door closed very gently. it sticks. he pulls harder. the knob pops off in his hand and he falls backward, tumbling down the stairs with a huge racket! ned doesn't stir. finally it's silent. lana exhales. a small bird lands on the sill of the open window, trilling a sweet little "chirp." ned sits bolt upright, irritated.}
