<L>__{interior cave day}
<A>__{jen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of animal fur. she sits up with a start and checks her clothes. looking around, she realizes she's in a cave. next to her are a lamp, some hunting equipment, and a neat row of sharp arrows. she quickly grabs one of the arrows.}
<C>__{lo}
<D>__{if you like that arrow, i can make you a bow. great for hunting wild chicken. they're delicious.}
<A>__{jen raises one of the arrows, going on the attack again, but her legs betray her and she falls.}
<C>__{lo}
<D>__{you need to eat, understand? then you'll have the strength to fight. understand?}
<A>__{he helps her up, then pours her some horse milk from a sac. he hands her a small chunk of food, which she first accepts grudgingly, then, her hunger getting the better of her, she starts to wolf it down.}
<C>__{lo}
<D>__{you're eating too fast. slowly.}
