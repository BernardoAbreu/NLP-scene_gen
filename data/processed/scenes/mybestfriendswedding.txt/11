<L>__{interior luxury box, comiskey park afternoon}
<A>__{game in progress. watched by michael, three groomsmen his age, two middle aged men, and one bodyguard. suddenly, a dull thumping at the door. it keeps up. they finally all look over. the bodyguard gets the door, revealing...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{which of you gents ordered two beers?}
<A>__{one single tray. holding fourteen beers. balancing on one hand. michael jumps up, terrified at the impending mayhem this sight suggests...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{wow! lemme give you a ha...}
<C>__{julianne }
<D>__{michael. you'll unwittingly imply that i'm clumsy.}
<A>__{he stops in his tracks. the guys whistle.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{think of that. and as well as i know you.}
<A>__{she goes first to the bodyguard.}
<C>__{bodyguard}
<D>__{sorry, ma'am, i'm on duty.}
<C>__{julianne }
<D>__{it's miss. and thanks. that leaves two for me.}
<A>__{heads down the row...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{julianne potter, this is hank and gerry from si, and you know daniel...}
<A>__{she's nodding, flawlessly plucking two beers each from perimeter of the tray, keeping the rest perfectly balanced in the center. michael is flat dumbstruck. next, a tall patrician gentleman with rolled up sleeves on his hand stitched silk shirt...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{oh. this is my father in law, walter.}
<A>__{once again, she gracefully plucks two beers for the distinguished father in law...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how are you doing this? you're on drugs.}
<A>__{sets them down. the man has a smile wonderful in its ease. murmurs...}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{if he gives you grief, i will have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{under the circumstances. charmed to know you, jules.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{nice meeting you, too, walt.}
<A>__{a nod between equals. she moves on...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{and, this guy, you know...}
<A>__{she sure does, and effortlessly balancing her one hand load, she dips to kiss a porky, balding guy with big time shoulders. straight on the lips.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{papa joe.}
<A>__{they go way back. he is uncomfortable at this rich man's wedding, even as gracious as everyone has been. his watering eyes twinkle at her, and the voice has a trace of boston...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you gonna be my boy's best man?}
<A>__{despite shouts from the others...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{best everything, joe. but i'm going to dance with you.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{dance? you don't dance! you learn to dance??}
<A>__{her innocent smile.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{moves. you've never seen.}
<A>__{big reaction from the guys, as she heads toward michael with the last of the beers, not looking down at the fielder's mitt which lies right in her path, and as his lips part to scream a warning, she skips... ... neatly around it. he's in shock.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you're an impostor! what have you done with my best friend?}
<A>__{as he takes away the remaining beers...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{and how was the hot dog?}
<A>__{hot dog? his eyes fix on her left breast. huge mustard stain. she can't believe it.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{cheap and unnecessary. we were looking anyway.}
