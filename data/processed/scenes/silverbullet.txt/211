<L>__{exterior edgar rounds, close}
<A>__{he's the one screaming, and if he reminds us of o'banion, that's okay, because rounds has also been caught in a trap. he tries to run, stumbles, falls into the ground fog. he goes on screaming. we can see his back for a moment, and then it disappears.}
<B>__{sounds of crunching and screaming.}
<A>__{rounds shrieks. his hand and arm come up like the hand of a drowning man. then it's gone. rounds is gone.}
