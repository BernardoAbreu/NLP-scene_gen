<T>__{in another corner:}
<D>__{he duke of norfolk, the most powerful nobleman in the room, and close personal friend of the king's walks with his growling dogs to where sir thomas boleyn and lady elizabeth are sitting. sir thomas gets to his feet..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{thomas.. he duke ignores thomas, and goes instead to his sister, (lady elizabeth), and kisses her..}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{i think i have managed to persuade the king to come and stay with you on progress. a week end's hunting in late summer.}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{but that's wonderful! thank you, thank you so much..}
<P>__{(he turns to elizabeth)}
<D>__{did you hear that, elizabeth?}
<C>__{lady elizabeth}
<P>__{(hates the idea)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{finally we can present george, and with luck, get him a position at court. lady elizabeth excuses herself, and leaves..}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{these are difficult times. i have it on good authority that the queen no longer bleeds yet the matter of a male heir is still not resolved.}
<P>__{a beat)}
<D>__{it cannot be long before the king is forced to look outside the marriage.}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{what? and make a bastard king of england?}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{a legitimized bastard. what choice does he have?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{obviously, i've given it thought, and wondered which howard girl i could put under his nose. imagine the influence that would give us. to be blood family of the next king of england. equally, imagine if another family were to achieve the same? norfolk indicates sir john seymour in the corner, and his two loathsome, ambitious sons edward and thomas..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{what about anne? sir thomas turns, and indicates anne across the crowds, who's dancing with george...}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{i realise as a `boleyn' she is not officially a `howard', but as your sister's daughter..}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{but she's your eldest, thomas. your first born. and your favourite. wouldn't you prefer her to have a nice, uncomplicated, respectable marriage? like mary?}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{if anne were an uncomplicated, respectable girl like mary, then i'd say `yes'. but she's not. sir thomas looks out at anne..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{she's anything but. interior boleyn castle day sir thomas and lady elizabeth stand in a corner, watching the party continue. elizabeth's face darkens..}
<C>__{ady elizabeth}
<D>__{don't like it. it would cost a fortune to make our house fit for a royal visit. money we don't have.}
<P>__{and what if thedy elizabeth(cont'd)}
<D>__{la king doesn't like her? or if she sleeps with him but gives him a girl?}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{and what if you were to look on the bright side? just once? an ominous clap of thunder outside..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{risk nothing, you gain nothing. ady elizabeth stares at her husband..}
<C>__{lady elizabeth}
<D>__{hen was it that people stopped thinking of ambition as a sin, and started thinking of it as a virtue?}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{easy for you to say. you've had power and wealth all your life.}
<C>__{lady elizabeth}
<D>__{until i married you, thomas. and i was happy to give it up. lady elizabeth turns, and walks back inside. interior corridor night anne knocks on the door of her father's study. she waits. presently, the door opens. we see sir thomas inside..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you asked to see me father?}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{yes. come in. sir thomas closes the door. interior hever castle night mary is in a bathroom. being prepared by anne for her wedding night. anne brushes her sister's hair. rubs oil in her skin.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{o the king himself is coming to hever. i'm so happy for george.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{yes. but father took me aside. it seems he has ambitions for me, too.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{he thinks i'm anne(coage dnow...and of not}
<P>__{of an nt' )}
<D>__{unpleasing appearance...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what? what are you saying..?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{it's known the king has a wandering eye. imagine...if he were to like me?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{but...you could never be more than his mistress. and that's no substitute for a husband.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but as the king's mistress the least i'd get after he finished with me would be an earl. and if i fell pregnant? and gave him what his wife has failed to?}
<P>__{a beat)}
<D>__{quite apart from the money, it'd be a duke at least.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{but what about your happiness? your future? anne shrugs, smiles..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i could be a happy duchess. interior bedrooom night mary and anne enter the bedroom. a sea of candles. mary stares at the bed. a child. suddenly terrified.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{are you nervous?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{a little.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you'll tell me everything in the morning?}

<D>__{i promise.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{no details spared? the two sisters hug tightly. visibly emotional.}
<A>__{the door opens, and william carey appears in the doorway. anne curtseys, gives mary a last `good luck' kiss, then goes. mary stares at her husband.}

<D>__{you are, aren't you?}
<A>__{william carey smiles, looks at his gorgeous bride..}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i am the luckiest man in the world.}

<C>__{william }
<D>__{drink?}
<A>__{mary shakes her head. but william tenderly insists..}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{you should. it will hurt less.}
<A>__{mary nervously drinks..}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{lie back.}
<A>__{mary lies down. then she lifts up her nightdress. william pulls down his trousers. mary extends her hands. inviting him to join her. william slowly lowers himself on top of her. he enters her. mary smiles, in anticipation of pleasure. a side to her one might not have imagined. but one or two strokes later, and william's knuckles whiten, his face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her. mary looks up. surely that wasn't it?}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{thank you. william rolls over. mary stares. soon william snores contentedly. mary is wide awake. confused. aybe this is how it's meant to be.}
