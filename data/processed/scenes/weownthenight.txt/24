<L>__{interior bobby's apartment living room}
<A>__{a mussed bobby enters from the bedroom, passing the party. bobby opens the front door: louis, hazel. thrilled, he waves them in. when the rest of the room sees louis, they scream "jumbo!" he holds his arms aloft, as if greeting an adoring crowd.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{uh oh [the] party's really gonna get started now!}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<D>__{yeah let's all play spin my pickle!}
<A>__{as everyone guffaws, freddie the bouncer yells out:}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{hey falsetti! you get what we wanted?}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{indeed i did, my friend!}
<P>__{(quieter, to bobby)}
<D>__{see, i woulda been here sooner, `cept i hadda go across town, lose all the cops }
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{there weren't no cops following us!}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<D>__{shut your mouth! you wouldn't recognize `em they were, they were all undercover.}
<A>__{bobby laughs happily, knowing this is bullshit. hazel shakes her head, joins the gals. louis starts emptying his pockets. out comes a pharmacy. drugs spill all over a formica endtable. louder:}
<C>__{louis falsetti }
<D>__{anyway, i got a little of what everybody asked for here. i got uppers, downers, hash, mescaline, some blow }
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{any spanish fly in there for you?}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<D>__{yeah, you need that, not me!}
<A>__{bobby laughs again, pings louis on the ear. lou grabs his head, but ignores the needling. louis looks up, observes bobby's clothes:}
<C>__{louis falsetti }
<D>__{and what's with the suit anyway? you look like a monkey in the circus!}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i'm goin' up to see buzhayev tonight. i think he's gonna ask me to buy into the club.}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<D>__{yeah? well, you know what you should do, you should turn it into a fag joint and then maybe they'll let ya in!}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i will show you a fuckin' faggot!}
<A>__{bobby starts to punch louis in the arm, playfully but hard. rosario enters the room, singing along with the song that's playing (yaz's "situation"). she moves to bobby's side, mock punches louis' stomach too. to the gang, with cheer:}
<C>__{bobby green }
<D>__{everybody, i gotta be at el caribe in an hour, so get ready!}
