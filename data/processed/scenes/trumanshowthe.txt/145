<L>__{exterior lower manhattan. day.}
<A>__{we pan down one concrete canyon after another. the usually bustling financial district is totally, eerily deserted. suddenly we see a line of people fanned out across a street. then another and another. people of every description, shoulder to shoulder, marching down the otherwise empty streets the way a search is conducted at a crime scene. the lines include principals and extras linked arm in arm, wardrobed for their usual roles as executives and secretaries, store clerks, telephonists, maintenance and construction workers, waiters and waitresses, cooks, shoppers, health workers, security guards, postal workers, police officers, fire fighters and homeless people. on one occasion we glimpse truman's colleagues, lawrence, errol and vivien, amongst the searchers. a building to building, floor to floor, office to office search is also being conducted, each structure secured as they go, the searchers paying special attention to potential blind spots such as closets, dumpsters, man holes, sewers, car trunks, trees and shrubbery. we focus on one of the waves of searchers. truman has linked arms in the middle of a row, his disguise still holding up. a swarm of helicopters fills the sky.}
