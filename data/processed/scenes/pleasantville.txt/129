<L>__{exterior lover's lane. night.}
<A>__{david and margaret are locked in a deep passionate kiss. at first they don't separate when they hear the booming clap of thunder. it is only when they hear the second one and the rain starts to fall, that margaret pulls back and looks up in the sky.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{what is that?}
<B>__{angle. david.}
<A>__{he is still in an amorous daze and doesn't even feel the increasing rain. it starts to pound harder and margaret looks to him in terror.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{rain.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{real rain?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yeah ... you don't have rain either?}
<A>__{she looks at him frightened. david smiles.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{right. of course you don't ...}
<A>__{he puts his jacket around her and starts to lead her up the grassy slope. a dozen other couples go scurrying up the bank, looking in terror at the water falling from the sky.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{what do we do?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(reaching the car)}
<D>__{we'll just put up the top.}
<A>__{he goes fishing around the boot of the car, looking for the catch to release it. david leans into the back seat fishing around as the rain starts to pound harder.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{what top?}
<A>__{he looks back at her. no top either. david smiles, drenched in rain and puts his arm around margaret who is starting to shiver.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's fine. come on.}
<A>__{he leads her back to a thicket of bushes where several of the kids are clustered together. they look at one another, terrified, as they huddle for shelter beneath the ledge of an overhanging rock.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{it's alright. there's nothing to be afraid of.}
<A>__{they look a little reassured and margaret looks up at him positively adoringly. she clings to his shoulder as the storm howls a few feet away ...}
