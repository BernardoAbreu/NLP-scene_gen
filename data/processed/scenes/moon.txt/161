<A>__{sam 1 marches up to his rover, tosses in the backpack and dips inside without his helmet, closes the door and backs out into the black day. i e. sam 1's rover moon surface sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the rover he looks possessed, determined a man on a mission }
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{sam's rover approaches one of the many jammers that we now know circle the perimeter of the base. sam 1 stops the rover on the other side of the jammer. here, outside the range of the jammers, he figures he might be able to get a signal through to earth. on sam as he removes his equipment from the backpack and starts to uncoil wires inserts a small battery pack onto the back of the vp, sits the vp on his lap. the vp resembles a play station portable with its small but nonetheless high quality screen. sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters some numbers from memory. the vp shaking in his hands. he is nervous, scared. he disables the video mode on his end, so he is only sending audio. a moment of silence. the vp seems dead.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{come on...come on...}
<A>__{then the vp beeps the monitor blips the message seems to have gone through. and suddenly a girl appears on the screen. sam 1 can't believe it. it's the same girl from his hallucinations. same wheat colored hair. same freckles dotting her cheek bones. same yellow dress. the moment sam 1 sees the girl he thinks naturally that he's imagining things again. but then she speaks:}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{that's never happened before. sam 1 finally manages to respond:}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{uh, bell residence?}
<A>__{the conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or two, and the girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. we assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on the girl's end. the girl is sweet, chirpy nothing like the haunting, ghost like figure from sam 1's hallucinations.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{this is the bell residence.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{i'm trying to reach tess bell.}
<A>__{the girl's expression shifts now somewhere between melancholy and curiosity }
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.}
<A>__{sam 1 gasps. he literally gasps. like someone just plunged a paring knife into his belly.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{no...no way.}
<A>__{the girl just stares.}
<C>__{sam 1 }
<D>__{tess bell? are you sure?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{uh, yeah, i think so. i'm her daughter.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<A>__{and astonishingly, the news of tess's death actually takes a back seat as sam 1 is forced to confront this new revelation. the girl is eve bell. sam 1 is talking to his daughter. sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{eve?}
<A>__{sam 1 can't believe it. she's beautiful. she's beautiful.}
<C>__{eve bell}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{a moment. eve looking more closely, trying to decipher sam}
