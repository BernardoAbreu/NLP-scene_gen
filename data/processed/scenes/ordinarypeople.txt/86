<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{come inside.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{could we talk about buck's funeral?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i know it'll seem trivial, but it's on my mind, or has been, and i'd just like to talk about it.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{when i was getting dressed for buck's funeral, i was...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{calvin, what's the matter with you?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{just let me get it off my chest,ok?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what could getting dressed for buck's funeral possibly have to do with anything right now?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i was wearing a blue shirt. and you said: wear a white shirt and the other shoes! it was nothing at the time. but it's always seemed to stay with me. and i, for some reason, been thinking about it and it suddenly occured to me what difference did it make what i wore at buck's funeral?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{ha, ha.}
<A>__{beth retreats inside the house to the kitchen.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{just hear me out, beth! it won't hurt you to listen!}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i won't listen to that! no one in their right mind would listen to that.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i just want to talk about something i always remembered.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{why do you want to remind me of it?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{because i've always wondered, in some needling way, what it mattered what i wore. i was crazy that day. we were going to our son's funeral. and you were worried about what i wore on my feet. i'm sure it sounds like nothing to you, but it sticks with me and i just wanted to ...tell you about it.}
<A>__{she comes to him and takes him into her arms.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it's all right.}
