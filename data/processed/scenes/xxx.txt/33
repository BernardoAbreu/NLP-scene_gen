<A>__{close on xander's face he comes to, blinking in low red light. he's shocked to find that he's...}
<L>__{interior airplane twilight}
<A>__{xander's on the floor of a military aircraft. two other tough guys are waking up next to him. one's a greaser named virg, the other is t.j., ex navy. xander notices as they each pull out chrome darts. they sit up, looking at each other. xander chuckles.}
<C>__{virg}
<D>__{what's so damn funny?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{been to any good diners lately?}
<A>__{the three laugh, realizing they're all in the same boat.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{we must be the final "candidates".}
<A>__{they quiet down as they notice for the first time, they are}
<B>__{not alone.}
<A>__{sitting silently on benches facing them are soldiers dressed in black. they wear black masks over their faces. they are a nasty looking black ops team.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{nobody told me this was a costume party.}
<A>__{the black ops team, just stares.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{i've worked with guys like this before. black ops. serious government spooks.}
<A>__{virg notices something strapped to his body. they all have them.}
<C>__{virg}
<D>__{heads up, man. what's this thing on my back?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{a parachute. this does not argue well.}
<A>__{then the red light switches to green. one of the soldiers opens the jump door. the rest of the team advances on xander, virg and t.j.}
<C>__{virg}
<D>__{this is bullshit! hey!}
<A>__{they drag virg to the door and throw him out. t.j. goes next, kicking and fighting. then they turn on xander.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i get the picture.}
<A>__{xander jumps out on his own. we see him tumbling away from the airplane. far below his chute blossoms open.}
