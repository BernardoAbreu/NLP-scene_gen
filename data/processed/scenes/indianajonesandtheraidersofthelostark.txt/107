<L>__{exterior outskirts of cairo (various shots) day}
<A>__{indy has an ever decreasing lead on the staff car as the race thunders into the narrow streets. people and animals leap out of the way; carts and barrels go flying helter skelter. indy takes the truck down a street so narrow there are only inches to spare on each side. pedestrians jump into doorways.}
<L>__{exterior omar's square day}
<A>__{when the truck clears the narrow street, it is in a small square. omar's garage is gaping open on the opposite side. indy hits the brakes and the truck skids across the square and into the garage. the garage door slams shut and tenting drops from the building to hide the door. various arabs, friends of omar, rush out with fruit carts and baskets and set up a mini bazaar in seconds. two arab boys sweep the tracks of the truck into oblivion. they throw aside their brooms just as the staff car appears from the narrow street. belloq and shliemann look around desperately as the blond driver steers the car through the square and out the other side.}
