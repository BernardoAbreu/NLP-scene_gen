<L>__{interior lois piper agency day}
<A>__{the small reception area for the lois piper agency. tastefully decorated. phones constantly chirping. the young male assistant behind the counter, obviously paid to be patient, points to the framed sign on the counter, in large letters: no unsolicited manuscripts will be accepted. colette and dr. xiroman will not be deterred. she holds a thick manila envelope.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{i have to see ms. piper. we just need five minutes. 1 2 3 4 5 minutes of her time.}
<A>__{the assistant points back to the sign.}
<C>__{colette }
<D>__{can you just please stick your head in her office, tell her that colette mooney is here. i know she's busy, but she'll certainly want to see my manuscript.}
<A>__{the assistant ignores her.}
<C>__{colette }
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{i'm a graduate of mills college.}
<A>__{behind them, coming from the inner office, we hear lois piper yelling.}
<C>__{lois }
<D>__{if i have to read one more vampire story, i swear i will drive a stake through my own goddamn heart.}
<A>__{manuscript comes flying out of her office. loose pages splatter everywhere in the main office. lois piper quickly follows. older. tired. needs a drink. now. caption: lois piper}
<C>__{lois }
<D>__{vampires! zombies! harry potter knock offs! people writing about their dogs! just shoot me now!}
<A>__{it is at that moment when lois first notices the camera. caught off guard. what the hell??? colette cranes her neck over the assistant.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{ms. piper? ms. piper?}
<A>__{lois turns her attention to colette. who are you? then magically lois changes. a big smile replaces the scowl. she marches towards colette, who is clearly not expecting a warm reception. lois walks right past colette and instead warmly shakes hands with dr. xiroman.}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{dr. xiroman. i can't believe you're here. how lovely to see you again.}
<A>__{dr. xiroman nods his head in greeting.}
<C>__{lois }
<D>__{just in the neighborhood? please come in for a minute.}
<A>__{another glance at the camera. then, taking dr. xiroman by the elbow, lois guides him back towards her office, completely snubbing a bewildered colette.}
<C>__{lois }
<D>__{my family talks about you all the time. you were so helpful to my sister. she's doing much better.}
<A>__{colette stands there helplessly, watching her future walk away. the assistant points in their direction: get in there!}
