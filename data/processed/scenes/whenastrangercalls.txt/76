<L>__{exterior bar night}
<A>__{it is lit up inside. the bar is open for business. across the street in a dark space between two buildings, duncan is waiting, watching the front door of the bar to see who comes out.}
<L>__{interior bar}
<A>__{the place is empty but for hank who half watches the television over the bar, and tracy who sits alone in a corner. several moments pass as both of them sit and wait. then, the front door starts to swing open. someone is coming in. tracy and hank both glance nervously toward the door. a man's head peeks in. he is somewhere in his forties, a regular customer.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{hey, hank, what're you doing open tonight?}
<C>__{hank}
<P>__{(relaxing)}
<D>__{trying to make a buck.}
<A>__{the customer walks up to the bar, sits down and talks quietly with hank. tracy looks nervously at her wristwatch. she stubs out her cigarette, takes one last gulp of her drink and stands up to go. she walks to the bar, opens her purse and reaches inside.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{keep it, honey. my treat.}
<A>__{they exchange a meaningful look. then she heads for the door.}
<C>__{customer}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{that how you make a buck?}
