<A>__{merriweather scowls and nods at bladen, who steps over to a television and turns it on. merriweather, meanwhile, pulls out a photograph of a slick asian man in a red suit, slides it onto the table.}
<C>__{officer merriweather}
<D>__{what do you know about jimmy lang?}

<C>__{alan}
<D>__{nothing?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{who is he?}
<C>__{officer merriweather}
<D>__{jimmy lang runs the infamous shiang xi crime organization, and is wanted in seven states for money laundering, drug smuggling, racketeering and murder.}

<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{yeah, that's right.}
<A>__{on the television, grainy surveillance camera footage of a birthday party starts playing. in the video, jimmy lang sits in an upscale restaurant, in front of a birthday cake, as a table full of hip asian guys serenade him with "happy birthday to you." when the guys sitting next to jimmy lean forward to help him blow out the candles on his cake, however, we see that it's vick, alan, stu, doug, and some black guy, all very drunk!}
<P>__{vick & alan & stu & doug (on tape)}
<D>__{happy birthday dear jimmmmy, happy birthday tooo yoooou!}
<A>__{everyone applauds. vick drunkenly hugs jimmy lang.}
<C>__{vick }
<D>__{i love you, jimmy lang!}

<C>__{stu}
<D>__{we're in a lot of trouble, aren't we.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{officers, i swear, we have no memory of that ever occurring }
<C>__{officer bladen}
<D>__{okay. maybe a night in jail will jostle something loose.}

<D>__{oh no, sir, please don't!}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{we have a very important wedding !}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{i know jimmy lang.}
<A>__{everyone stops, looks at vick.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{you do?!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{jimmy and i tried to raise capital for girl nasium, a 24 hour fitness center and day spa for tween age girls, but it never got off the ground. it was an entirely legitimate enterprise i had no idea he was a criminal. we must've bumped into him last night, and he must've invited us to join his birthday celebration. no crime in that, is there, officers?}
<A>__{merriweather gets in vick's face, intense.}
<C>__{officer merriweather}
<D>__{you actually expect me to believe that dung?}
<C>__{vick}
<P>__{(unblinking)}
<D>__{yes, officer merriweather. i do.}
<C>__{officer merriweather}
<D>__{if i find out you're lying to me, son, i will take all of you down, is that clear?}
<C>__{officer bladen}
<D>__{you boys wouldn't last three hours in prison.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{stu might.}
<A>__{stu shakes his head, unbelievable.}
<C>__{vick }
<D>__{now: are you gonna charge us with something, or are we free to go?}
<A>__{the cops look at each other, scowling. beat.}
<C>__{officer bladen}
<D>__{get outta here.}
<A>__{stu and alan quickly hop to their feet and make for the door.}
<C>__{alan}
