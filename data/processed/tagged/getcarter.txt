<A>__{on the other side of the headland, the scene is extraordinary. the deserted beach is like the edge of the world. the sand is black as far as the eye can see. it's littered with rubbish. several old lorries are sunk deep in the sand. high, grass covered cliffs flank it on the left. it's deserted. in the distance, a continuous line of giant black buckets move, like cable cars, out to sea, before they deposit their load of coal slag and move inland again. the coal mine itself is inland, hidden away behind the cliffs. the sea, like the sand, is black as it crashes on to the shore. eric is half way along the beach, struggling in the mud. carter closes on him.}
