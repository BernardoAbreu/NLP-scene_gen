<A>__{hi sits in a lawn chair in front of the trailer. ed sits on his lap, his arms around her. both are wearing sunglasses, looking at the setting sun. the scene is suffused with a warm yellow light.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{these were the happy days, the salad days as they say...}
<A>__{as the sun sets, the light is turning from yellow to amber. hi and ed watch, their heads following its slow downward arc.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...and ed felt that having a critter was the next logical step. it was all she thought about.}
<A>__{the amber is turning to a more neutral dusky light as the sun has set. hi and ed continue to stare at the point where it disappeared.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...her point was that there was too much love and beauty for just the two of us...}
<A>__{the dusk is slipping away into darkness.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...and every day we kept a child out of the world was a day he might later regret having missed.}
<A>__{we are by now holding on pitch black. crickets chirp. from the darkness:}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{that was beautiful.}
<B>__{a calendar}
<A>__{ed is crossing off the last day on the calendar before a day circled in red.}
