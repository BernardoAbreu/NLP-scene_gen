<L>__{exterior highway day}
<A>__{steam pours from under the hood of the cherokee. amy gets out and looks around at the scorched wasteland. jeff goes to the front of the car, gropes under the hood for the release latch. he yanks his hand away, burned by the hot metal.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{ow!}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<A>__{amy moves to jeff to examine the burn. she reaches out.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{i said i'm fine, okay?}
<A>__{jeff lifts the hood, examines the engine. he tugs on a cable, checks the battery connection and radiator. he goes to the passenger's side and takes a hand held cellular phone from the glove box. he dials zero and hits "send." the phone beeps.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{out of range?}
<A>__{jeff grunts, tosses the phone on the seat. it bounces and lands on the floor. amy watches as he returns to the engine and begins unscrewing the radiator cap.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what's going on, jeff?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what's it look like? i'm trying to fix the car.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{not the car.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what's going on with you?}
<A>__{jeff busies himself with the engine, not answering.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{it's been a month since you got back. you can't keep shutting me out like this.}
<A>__{jeff says nothing.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{jeff, i'm talking to you.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(flaring)}
<D>__{look, i really don't want to go into this right now. i'm changing jobs, our finances are fucked, and we're stuck in the middle of nowhere. so could we maybe just fix the }
<A>__{he stops in mid sentence. there is a rumble in the distance. they look down the road.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{christ, not these guys...}
<A>__{jeff's pov dodge ram pickup approaching fast on the road. as it streaks past, earl yells and launches a beer bottle from the window. the bottle shatters on the asphalt.}
<B>__{back to jeff}
<A>__{watching the ram speed away.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{asshole...}
<C>__{amy}
<P>__{(looking down the road)}
<D>__{jeff }
<A>__{a quarter mile away, the pickup is slowing. it pulls a u turn and stops, facing the cherokee. it just sits there, engine idling.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what's he doing?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{jeff watches the pickup, frowning. then, from the opposite direction, they hear a low rumble. they turn and stare at massive tractor trailer coming over a crest in the road. it's a huge eighteen wheeler. a white 1988 peterbilt. it grinds into low gear and slows, brakes creaking. the truck comes to a halt with a hiss of compressed air.}
<B>__{down highway}
<A>__{the pickup starts up again. it pulls another u turn and drives away, melting into the desert.}
<B>__{amy}
<A>__{breathes a sigh of relief. the driver dismounts from the cab, leaving the engine idling. we recognize him as the trucker in the mini mart. he removes his cap, revealing a shock of prematurely white hair. he is well shaven, his clothes immaculate. his name is red.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{you folks all right?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{yeah. our car broke down.}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{i figured that much. you want a hand pushing it off the road?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{thanks, i'd appreciate it. amy, you want to steer?}
<A>__{amy gets behind the wheel and puts the shift in neutral. jeff and red push the car to the shoulder. as they push, jeff glances at the cb antenna on red's cab.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{think you could radio a tow truck for us?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i sure would if i could, mister, but my c.b. blew a fuse this morning. i'm waiting till i hit the truck stop on i 40 to get it fixed.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{how far is that?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{about 60 miles.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{red walks around to the front of the car and peers down at the exposed engine.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i'd offer to take a look, but it's hard to say with these new engines. used to be, you could give 'em a kick and a holler and they'd start right up. now it's all computers and chips.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{it's a new car.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{that could be the problem. you been running it pretty fast?}
<A>__{amy gives jeff a reprimanding look. it's subtle, but red notices.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{tell you what. if you want a ride, there's a little diner up the road. belle's. they got a pay phone. you could call a tow truck from there.}
<A>__{jeff considers this, glances back to where the dodge ram was last seen.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{nice of you to offer. but we've got a lot of stuff in the car. i think we're better off waiting for a cop to come along.}
<A>__{amy rolls her eyes. red sees the look, trying not to smile. he glances up at a small plane flying overhead.}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{suit yourself. not many cops on this road, that's why the truckers use it. maybe you'll get lucky.}
<P>__{(tipping his cap)}
<D>__{good luck.}
<A>__{he turns and heads back toward his truck. amy looks at jeff. she waits till the trucker is out of earshot.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{are you nuts?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{we don't know this guy.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{he's offering to help. it could be hours before anyone else comes along. it's 100 degrees. you really want to be stuck out here?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{amy, i've got my equipment in the car. all our stuff. what if those guys come back and we're not here?}
<P>__{(turns away,}
<D>__{quietly to}
<P>__{himself)}
<D>__{jesus... don't be stupid...}
<A>__{amy hears this. she's had enough. flares.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{stupid is sitting out here waiting for a cop when we already have a ride.}
<A>__{in the b.g., the truck is throttling up. then, mad and careless:}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{stupid was letting you talk me into leaving boston.}
<A>__{she turns away. the truck starts to pull out. she bites her lip, thinking, then steps into the road and flags the truck down. red brakes.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{excuse me? do you think you could drop me at that diner?}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{sure thing. how about you, mister? i could take you both just as easy.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{that's okay. my husband wants to stay with the car. i will just get my purse.}
<A>__{she goes to the passenger side of the jeep for her purse. jeff follows, lowering his voice.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what do you think you're doing?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i'm going to the diner. i'm going to call a tow truck. then i'm going to order an iced tea and wait. good bye, jeff.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(firm)}
<D>__{you're not riding with that guy. end of story.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you wanted to be alone. well... you're alone. why don't you take the time to get your head together?}
<A>__{she walks to the truck. jeff stands there. she climbs into the cab. red moves some papers out of the way.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{watch your step, ma'am.}
<A>__{she pulls the door shut. the truck throttles up and pulls away. jeff watches the truck dwindle in the distance, flashers blinking. after a beat, the flashers cease.}
