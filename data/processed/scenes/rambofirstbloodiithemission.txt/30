<D>__{a couple klicks from insertion we go vertical to ten thousand and you punch out. navigate in free fall like a regular halo jump. you'll have a good moon.}

<D>__{i got your moon right here...}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{no problem. duck soup.}
<A>__{doyle notices that brewer has casually lit up a cigarette.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{hey, man... we got fuel on the deck. i don't like flying without a plane.}
<A>__{brewer glances at the pool of jet fuel around the pumping area. rambo plucks the cigarette from brewer's lips.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{no smoking on this mission. it's not healthy.}
<A>__{he looks brewer in the eye and flicks the lit butt into the pool of gas. which puts it out.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{son of a bitch!}
<A>__{rambo saunters away.}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(appreciatively)}
