<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior adjacent cages med. shot night}
<A>__{a few hours have passed. nova is watching taylor from her cage across the aisle. he sits on the pile of straw. there is an ugly welt on his cheek made by the security officer's whip. footsteps are heard. taylor and nova look up and off.}
<L>__{294 reverse angle what they see:}
<A>__{a solemn, teen age chimp named lucius appears outside the cage. the guard julius rises from his chair.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{are you julius?}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{i'm from the office of animal affairs.}
<P>__{(indicating taylor)}
<D>__{this male's to be transferred to the zoo.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{at this hour? who says so?}
<A>__{taylor enters scene, coming over to the cage bars as lucius continues gravely, with just a note of disdain.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{don't they tell you anything? the anti vivisectionist society is up in arms. they're going to save this beast from those butchers in the lab. if he can speak he belongs in the public zoo.}
<P>__{(taking off)}
<D>__{but what'll probably happen is that some money mad grown up will put him in a circus. and then we'll have to pay to see what rightfully should have }
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{stop making speeches and show me the order.}
<A>__{lucius hands the guard a document. it is dark here, so julius crosses to a beam of light near the bars and studies the document. lucius, behind the guard's back, signals frantically for taylor to seize or strike the guard. taylor is slow to understand. lucius shakes his head impatiently.}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(peering at document)}
<D>__{this order's no good. it must be counter signed by dr. zaius }
<A>__{lucius suddenly gives julius a violent shove. the guard's head crashes against the bars and he is stunned.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{hit him!}
<A>__{taylor complies bringing down the heel of his fist on the nape of the guard's neck. julius collapses. the youngster immediately squats down, gags him, and begins to bind him hand and foot. camera moves in.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{lucius}
<P>__{(looking up,coolly)}
<D>__{so you can talk.}
<P>__{(as he works)}
<D>__{i'm dr. zira's nephew. this abduction was her idea. you're not really going to the zoo. that's just our cover story in case we're stopped.}
<P>__{(off again)}
<D>__{although i do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property }
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{come on. get me out of here.}
<A>__{taking the guard's keys, lucius rises and unlocks the cage. nova enters the scene, coming to the bars of her cage.}
