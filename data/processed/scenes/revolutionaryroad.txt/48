<A>__{the kids dance back and forth through the sprinkler, shrieking with pleasure. april sits on the steps in front of the house reading some material from the american express office. she looks up as frank's car pulls into the drive. he steps out of the car and comes towards her. she looks up and smiles. he drops his brief case on the ground and walks towards her. she meets him in the middle of the lawn, and they embrace.}
