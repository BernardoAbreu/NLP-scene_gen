<A>__{kirsty enters the room just as tiffany is about to go down one of the corridors. kirsty screams at her.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{tiffany stops, startled, and looks at the doorway and kirsty. kirsty raises her hands in a placatory gesture and speaks more softly.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{wait. wait.}
<A>__{kirsty begins to move into the room slowly and shakes her head gently.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{hey, remember me? from the hospital? i was in the next room?}
<A>__{kirsty is rewarded with a small recognizing smile from tiffany, kirsty returns the smile.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{you don't want to go down there. you really don't want to go down there.}
<A>__{tiffany turns her head once more to look down the corridor and then turns back to kirsty. for a second it looks as if kirsty's persuasions have succeeded, but malahide's training has been too thorough; tiffany knows a puzzle when she sees one. she smiles once more at kirsty and then suddenly turns and disappears into the corridor. kirsty stands still for a moment, as if she can't quite believe that tiffany has done it. she shakes her head half in disbelief and half in despair.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<A>__{pausing only to pick up the lament configuration from where tiffany has left it on the floor, she heads straight for the corridor and follows tiffany in.}
