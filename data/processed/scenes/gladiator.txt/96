<P>__{(to lucius)}
<D>__{and just wait until you hear what happened to some of our other ancestors! if you're very good, tomorrow night i will tell you the story of emperor claudius. he was betrayed! by those closest to him...}

<D>__{... by his own blood... they whispered in dark corners and went out late at night and conspired and conspired...}
<A>__{lucilla looks as if she is going to be ill. lucius is busy scanning the scroll. commodus gently strokes his hair, his cold eyes never leaving lucilla's.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{but the emperor claudius knew that they were up to something dire. he knew they were busy little bees. and one night he sat down with one of them and he looked at her and he said: "tell me what you have been doing, busy little bee, or i shall strike down those dearest to you. you shall watch as i bathe in their blood." and the bee knew he spoke the truth, for the emperor always speaks the truth. and what do you think happened then, lucius?}
<C>__{lucius}
