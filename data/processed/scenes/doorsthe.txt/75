<L>__{exterior new york street night (winter)}
<A>__{snow on the streets... a group of druggies staggering in the snowbanks, throwing snowballs, stupid giggling, wheezing puffs of cold air... jim throws the golden telephone into the trash and pees on it. iris shots continue pamela laughing battily with tom baker who's putting the make on her... the count is on heroin. jim passing a vodka bottle back and forth with nico hitting a stash of ups. they fall in the snow, mad russian winter.}
