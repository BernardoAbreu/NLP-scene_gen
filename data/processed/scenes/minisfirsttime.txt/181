<L>__{exterior a high school graduation ceremony day}
<A>__{seniors in gowns sit awaiting their diplomas, as parents sit in the audience, fanning themselves with programs. mini stands at the dais, addressing the class.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{...as many of you know, the past few months of my life have been very difficult. i don't know how i would have gotten through it without all of you. i really think it is a testament to the love in this institution, that i stand before you today, as the first straight "c" student in school history voted valedictorian.}
<A>__{a few cheers go up from the rowdier students.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{again, to marvin tepperman, the real valedictorian, he deserved this and i want to wish him a speedy recovery. i spoke to his doctors today and they say, with medication and therapy, marvin should be able to attend harvard this fall.}
<A>__{a polite smattering of applause is heard.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{while i may not have excelled in the classroom, i think my recent experiences in that bigger schoolhouse we call "life", have taught me a few lessons that i'd like to share with my fellow graduates.}
<A>__{her classmates instinctively lean forward a little to listen.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{follow your heart and don't question it, now matter where it tells you to go. trust me, it'll open up a world of new experiences you can't even imagine.}
<A>__{principal andrews nods in approval.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{but as you listen to it, don't forget your family, your parents. don't forget they're people too, and while we may not always agree with them, remember to love them when they need love.}
<A>__{a few parents look almost surprised to hear positive things said about them.}
<C>__{mini}
<P>__{(voice breaking)}
<D>__{and i mean really love them, don't just pay them lip service. really do it...whenever you can.}
<P>__{(holding back tears)}
<D>__{i know i did, and i just wish my dad could be here today, so after this speech i could just walk down into the audience and give him my love right here...in front of all of you. thank you and good luck.}
<A>__{mini puts her speech down, gently sobbing, as the audience erupts. principal andrews moves quickly to console her.}
<D>__{mini (v.o.) (cont'd) like i promised, no prom night highjinks, no nerds becoming popular, no shakespeare shoved up your ass.}
<A>__{mini's fellow graduates give her a standing ovation. a few parents become misty eyed.}
<D>__{mini (v.o.) (cont'd) and in case you're feeling guilty about having no one to identify with but me, relax...}
<A>__{mini looks out across the crowd and a huge smile ripples across her face, as she waves to everyone in the golden sunlight.}
<D>__{mini (v.o.) (cont'd) ...there's a first time for everything.}
