<L>__{interior pensione abruzzo day}
<A>__{the internal courtyard is refreshingly cool. in the centre of the courtyard is a fountain made of marble shot through with black veins. in the fountain stands an alabaster statue of a girl. she's wearing a toga and holding a clam shell from which the water falls. the water is delivered by a two and quarter millimetre diameter pipe made of bronze. as jack crosses the courtyard he glances at the statue. he finds it hard to tear his eyes away.}
