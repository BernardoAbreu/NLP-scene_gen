<L>__{interior travel agency. day.}
<A>__{the employees and customers inside global travel are all doing a last minute primp, fixing their hair and checking their clothes. suddenly, in unison, they take their positions and begin working. as truman enters global travel, one customer looks up a fraction too quickly, anticipating his arrival. truman takes a seat at the only unoccupied desk, opposite a female travel agent. feeling uneasy about a surveillance camera in the corner of the room, he nervously obscures his face with his hand.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i wanna book a flight to australia.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{where exactly?}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(believing she is being deliberately obtuse)}
<D>__{australia.}
<C>__{agent}
<P>__{(a trace of condescension)}
<D>__{where in australia? what city?}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{sorry, sydney. sydney, australia. that's right.}
<C>__{agent}
<P>__{(entering the destination in her computer)}
<D>__{for how many?}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(finding the question suspicious)}
<D>__{one.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{when do you want to leave, remembering, of course, that you do lose a day on the way there?}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(more urgent than he intended)}
<D>__{today.}
<C>__{agent}
<P>__{(reading off her computer screen)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i don't have anything for a week.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{a week.}
<C>__{agent}
<P>__{(patiently explaining)}
<D>__{it's the busy season.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(paranoia showing)}
<D>__{you sure you're not trying to keep me here? you are a travel agent, aren't you? your job is to help people travel, not keep 'em where they are.}
<P>__{(pointing to the agent's name tag, "doris travel agent")}
<D>__{or maybe you're a different kind of agent, doris?}
<C>__{agent}
<P>__{(showing amazing restraint)}
<D>__{i do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for australia tomorrow. but you wouldn't want to do that.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{why wouldn't i?}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{i thought you were in a hurry.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(calming down)}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{you want to book the flight?}
<A>__{truman pulls out a wad of money from his pocket and several rolls of quarters from marlon's vending machines. the agent looks askance at the pile of cash.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{you were expecting me, weren't you?}
<A>__{the travel agent ignores the question and prints the ticket.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{it's non refundable.}
