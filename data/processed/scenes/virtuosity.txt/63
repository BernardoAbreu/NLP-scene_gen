<A>__{madison and lindenmeyer watch parker on screen. madison still has her gun trained on lindenmeyer, who notices a warning light start to flash. he turns to parker's unconscious body lying on the bed. lindenmeyer looks concerned.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{lindenmeyer checks several readings on his console.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<D>__{he's developing a hemisphere imbalance.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{talk so i can understand.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<D>__{if i don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when i take him out of vr.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{then fix it.}
<A>__{as lindenmeyer moves to parker, madison stays right with him. her gun aimed at lindenmeyer's head. lindenmeyer carefully removes one of the neural connectors from parker's skull cap. before removing another, he looks for a safe place to put the connector.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<D>__{i need you to hold this. it can't get any dirt on it.}
<A>__{madison is reluctant, but doesn't know what else to do. lindenmeyer slowly gives the neural connector to her free hand.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer }
<D>__{all you have to do is hold the needle at the base. just make sure not to jab yourself with the pointerior..}
<A>__{she clutches the needle in her left hand while aiming her gun with her right. lindenmeyer removes a second neural connector from parker's skull. holding this second needle at the base, lindenmeyer makes several adjustments on the neural management computer, then moves slowly back to madison.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer }
<D>__{hand me the connector nice and...}
<A>__{he suddenly jabs his neural connector into madison's right forearm. madison has no time to react. 10,000 volts of electricity instantly courses through her body. madison drops to the floor, unconscious. the needle she had been holding falls from her grasp, breaking the circuit. she stops being electrocuted. which saves her life.}

<P>__{(as sid 6.7 had said)}
<D>__{god, some people are stupid.}
<A>__{he sits back down at the simulator's main console, and starts to type commands. on the monitor, parker is visible exiting the shopping mall.}
