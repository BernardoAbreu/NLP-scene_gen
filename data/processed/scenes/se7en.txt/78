<L>__{interior slum tenement building, stairwell morning}
<A>__{mills and somerset stand in the middle of one flight of stairs. they are both highly agitated.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{the way this has gone, i didn't think it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy. the type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year. to sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i want him bad. i don't just want to catch him anymore. i want to hurt him.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{listen... we have to divorce ourselves from our emotions here. we have to keep focusing on the small details.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i don't know about you, somerset, but i feed off my emotions.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{he'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.}
<A>__{mills is looking at the floor, burning with anger. somerset grabs him by the jacket.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{are you listening to me?!}
<A>__{mills pushes somerset's hand off.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i hear you.}
<A>__{there is a sudden brilliant flash of light and the sound of a camera advancing. mills and somerset look down the stairs, john is posing as a reporter. he has his camera and flash up, pointed at the detectives.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{say cheese.}
<A>__{he takes another picture, flashbulb flashing. mills charges downwards, grabs john by his wrinkled clothing.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing?}
<A>__{john squirms, holds up a laminated press identification pass.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i have a right, officer. i...}
<A>__{mills shoves him and john stumbles a few steps, then falls to the landing below with a thud. his glasses fly off.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{that doesn't mean anything. this is a closed crime scene now!}
<A>__{somerset steps down and pulls mills back. john stands.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you can't do this! you can't...}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{get the fuck out of here!}
<A>__{john gets his glasses, scrambles downstairs, out of sight.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{the public has a right to know!}
<A>__{somerset yanks mills harder, till mills sits on the stairs.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{how do those cockroaches get here so quick?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{they pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well. you can hate them, but you better give them something, or they'll make it all up.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(calming)}
<D>__{i'm sorry... i just...}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{oh, it's alright. it's always impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions.}
