<A>__{the next day. dignan and bob are still asleep. bob's on a folding bed. anthony's sitting at the table, reading a newspaper eating some cereal from one of those little boxes where you cut open the sides.}
<L>__{exterior motel pool. day}
<A>__{ahthony's swimming laps. he stops and hangs onto the side for a minute. across the pool he can see a good looking mexican maid about twenty years old standing beside her cart looking at him. he waves. she waves and gets back to work. a little while later. anthony's sitting in a chair by the pool, letting the sun dry him off. he's wearing just a swimsuit. dignan and bob are fully dressed, standing beside him.}
