<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{dumbshit.}
<A>__{wider angle as jones steps back confused from the high resolution environmental wall screen, a sort of cinerama video loop. ripley sits on a bench in what we now see is an atrium off the medical center, still somewhere in the bowels of gateway station. benches. some unenthusiastic potted trees. the sterile corridors visible beyond glass doors b.g. burke enters in his usual mode, casual haste.}

<D>__{sorry...i've been running behind all morning.}
<A>__{ripley seems healthier now, but still a bit brittle.}

<D>__{have they located my daughter yet?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{well, i was going to wait until after the inquest...}

<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i promised her i'd be home for her birthday. her eleventh birthday. i sure missed that one.}

<D>__{well...she has already learned to take my promises with a grain of salt. when it came to flight schedules, anyway.}
<A>__{burke nods, a simpatico presence.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you always think you can make it up to somebody...later, you know. but now i never can. i never can.}
<A>__{let's get one thing straight...ripley can be one tough lady. but the terror, the loss, the emptiness are, in this moment, overwhelming. she cries silently. burke puts a reassuring hand on her arm.}

<D>__{the hearing convenes at 0930. you don't want to be late.}
