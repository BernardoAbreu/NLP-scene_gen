<L>__{exterior jungle trail day}
<A>__{along a stream bed, the jungle trees still shiver. nick loads a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and chews anxiously on a piece of gum. sarah and dr. juttson are beside him as the group nervously follows the groaning forest trees to their right. at the rear, eddie and malcolm walk side by side. eddie is carrying a heavy silver rifle, an aluminum canister hanging beneath the barrel. he shows it to malcolm, his voice low and urgent.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{lindstradt air rifle. fires a subsonic fluger impact delivery dart.}
<A>__{he cracks open the cartridge bank, revealing a row of plastic containers filled with straw colored liquid. each is tipped with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning tag "extreme danger! lethal toxicity!"}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{i loaded the enhanced venom of conus purpurascens, the south sea cone shell. most powerful neurotoxin in the world. acts within a two thousandth of a second. faster than the nerve conduction velocity. the animal's down before it feels the prick of the dart.}
<A>__{from their right, the shaking trees seen closer now. by walking down the stream bed, the humans are tracking right along with the animals as they move in the foliage.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(to eddie)}
<D>__{is there an antidote?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{like if you shoot yourself in the foot? wouldn't matter. you'd be dead before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.}
<A>__{ahead of them, thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet. but around them, the crashing sounds get louder and closer, the swaying trees shiver right beside them. eddie raises the rifle in defense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway and part. above the foliage, they see the sudden movement of a row of stegosaur fins. the spade shaped fins run along a ridge down the middle of the animal's back, about three feet tall each. the group freezes, amazed, and as the stegosaur continues on, they get a good look at it through a break in the foliage. it's a large dinosaur with a small head, a thick neck, and a huge lumbering body. a double row of plates runs along the crest of its back, and it has a dragging trail with long spikes in it. the gum drops out of nick's mouth, flops onto his shirt, and sticks there.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh }
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{ my }
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{ god!}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{it's beautiful!}
<A>__{a second stegosaur, a baby about a quarter the size of the first animal, breaks through the foliage, following the adult. while the group is reaching to that, the earth vibrates and a third stego, by far the biggest of the three, walks out of the foliage right behind them, crossing within ten feet. apparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their environment, the stegos continue on across the stream bed. sarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures. her shutter is muted, so that a muffled click is all that's audible. juttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into it breathlessly.}
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{stegosaurus, family stegosauridae, infraorder stegosauria, suborder thyreophora. length, adult male, estimate twenty five to thirty feet.}
<A>__{his breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter, of all things, as he can't contain his astonishment. eddie covers his mouth, trying to keep him quiet.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(to juttsn)}
<D>__{that was a pair bond! a family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!}
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{i want to see the nesting ground!}
<A>__{nick turns to malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile, wordless, boy was i wrong on this one gesture. malcolm smiles, leans over, and taps softly on nick's video camera. nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group continues on into the bush after the animals. in the bush, the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near where sarah crouches in the bushes. sarah raises her camera again and silently snaps a picture. she whispers to juttson, who is beside her.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{lone nest not colonial. i don't see an egg clutch...}
<A>__{she gestures and juttson peers through a pair of field glasses.}
<C>__{juttson}
<P>__{(whispering back)}
<D>__{the empty shells are crushed and trampled. the young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{not without a shot of the nest.}
<A>__{she sees an opportunity. as the baby heads back to its parents, sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it, using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the other two. nick and eddie's faces whiten in alarm. nick reaches out to stop her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the clearing. in the clearing, sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back, toward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south. she raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd, ever better as she gets closer. back at the hill, the others can only watch her, aghast.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{she's gutty.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{she's nuts.}
<A>__{in the clearing, sarah keeps moving closer. the baby passes a small grouping of rocks and sarah ducks behind them. she's now in a perfect position to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off picture after picture from this ideal vantage pointerior she shoots the last picture on the roll and the camera's autowinder whirs to life. sarah looks down in horror as the camera's motor whines loudly in her hands. th noise startles the animals. the male turns toward her the plates on its back bristling. sarah gets to her feet and starts to move away, slowly. the male turns away from her and swings its tail, spikes extended. it whizzes through the air, right at her, but sarah leaps back at the last second and the tail's spikes thud into the dirt where she was. sarah crunches to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart away, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickly for animals their size. the others run to sarah, help her to her feet, and pull her back, against a massive tree trunk. but the tree trunk lifts right up off the ground. it's no tree, it's a dinosaur's leg, a massive one, six feet across, god knows how many feet high. the group gasps and looks up as a makenchiasaurus, an enormous saurupod over a hundred feet from nose to tail, lumbers away from them. the group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and honks furtively, its long neck stretched out above them. now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first. the first mamenchiasaur thunders around in a semi circle, getting into position behind the second. nick swings his video camera straight up and the group suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating. the mighty tails swing and snap around them as the two animals come together, and trees start snapping and falling, crashing to the jungle floor. the group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place where the trees are not falling which is directly underneath the animals! amid honks and bleats, the swinging tails continue to deforest the jungle around them. the noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the laughter and screams of the fascinated and terrified group. there is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from underneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest. a short distance away, the group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving with wild, frightened laughter. sarah goes to malcolm and throws her arms around him, exhilarated.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{ian, you're not insane! i'm so glad!}
<C>__{juttson}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{dr. malcolm the world owes you an apology.}
