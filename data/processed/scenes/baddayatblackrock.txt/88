<D>__{just as you took care of his buddies?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{just as i took care of his buddies. me, an' doc, and pete...}
<A>__{the sound of running feet padding along the dirt road increases on sound track. macreedy turns slightly, to see doc huffing toward him. the older man climbs the jail steps and comes to an abrupt halt, his eyes going from one to the other of the two men in the stand off.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(to macreedy)}
<D>__{it's all right, macreedy...}
<A>__{he pulls tim's mackinaw to one side, revealing the silver plated star pinned at the breast.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{old tim here's got his badge back.}
<A>__{macreedy swings his rifle from tim to smith. tim lowers his, stepping to one side, allowing smith, covered by macreedy, to enter the jail. he goes in, doc following. pete sits silently at tim's desk.}
