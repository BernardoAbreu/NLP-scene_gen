<L>__{exterior yacht at sea day}
<B>__{the bridge}
<A>__{a small yacht. osbourne stands at the wheel, a light wind in his face, as the boat sails under motor power. after a beat he moves to the front of the boat. an old man sits on a bench on the prow facing out into the wind. he has snowy hair and a stern yankee face. he wears a tweed cap. he doesn't much react to osbourne's approach.}
<C>__{osbourne}
<D>__{you okay there, dad?}
<A>__{the old man remains silent, staring. osbourne sits next to him and idly tucks in the plaid blanket resting over the man's knees.}
<C>__{osbourne }
<D>__{... dad, i left my job at the agency...}
<A>__{the old man stares out into the wind.}
<C>__{osbourne }
<D>__{... i, uh... i'm sorry. dad, government service is not what it was when you were in state. things are different now. i don't know, maybe it's... it's... the cold war ending; now it seems like it's all bureaucracy and no mission...}
<A>__{the old man stares out into the wind.}
<C>__{osbourne }
<D>__{... i'm writing a memoir. i think it's going to be pretty explosive. but i don't think you'll disapprove. i don't think you'll disapprove. katie has had trouble accepting it.}
<C>__{osbourne }
<D>__{but... sometimes there's a higher patriotism, dad. so we'll... yes, change is hard. it's hard on katie. but we'll be okay. we'll be okay. life is change. this is good. we were all blocked up, katie and me. this is, this is a blessing in disguise. i will go into training, you know. lay off the sauce. like you did. you managed to do it. finally. and then i can concentrate on, you know. new beginning. and this'll all have been for the best. don't you think dad?}
<A>__{the old man stares out into the wind. osbourne sniffles.}
<C>__{osbourne }
<D>__{... cold.}
<A>__{he taps the old man on the knee and rises.}
<C>__{osbourne }
<D>__{... i guess we should head back.}
