<L>__{exterior old barn night}
<A>__{trevor and margaret carry jack out of the barn. he's bloated, corpse like and covered in varicose veins. margaret is wearing a gag like swatch of clothing tied around her mouths, to protect themselves. trevor's gag is down around his chin so he can chatter.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{it's got to be some goddamn biological weapons. government's testin' 'em out on us! 'cause who gives a shit if wheelsy disappears, right?!}
<A>__{they set down jack and head back toward the barn.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i hope it ain't contagious. i will be pissed as hell i turn into a big mollusk. i will fuckin' sue, i swear to god.}
<A>__{starla, also wearing a gag, is kneeling beside wally, who is similarly sick and bloated. his lips are parched and cracking. starla squeezes a wet cloth, dripping all the water onto wally's lips. then she stands, and heads toward the creek. she doesn't see wally open his eyes behind her. he sits up, and stares over at starla with milky eyes as she kneels down beside the water. starla dips the swatch of clothing into the creek, re wetting it. she stands, and turns, only to see wally directly in front of her, standing between trees, almost completely covered in darkness.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{hey, sugarplum.}
<A>__{pause. starla pulls the gag from her mouth.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{wally speaks with grant's cadence.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{marriage. it's a sacred bond. just like you said.}
<A>__{starla stares at him. wally almost looks weepy.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{i'm sorry 'bout trying to strangle you and all. i lost lost my head. i didn't want to do none of the things i done. not kill them pets. not make brenda a womb. but it's my nature, ain't it? how can you blame a one for actin' according to his nature?}
<A>__{starla, too freaked to speak, takes a step back from him.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{i wanted to tell you what was going on. but i didn't didn't think you'd love me no more. i never knew... love, starla, i }
<A>__{trevor and margaret are setting down the older cop. they see wally standing. margaret pulls down her gag.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{wally?}
<A>__{wally turns and stares at her like some angry animal.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{you all right?}
<A>__{wally doesn't answer.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{maybe you better sit back down. you don't look so good.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{margaret.}
<A>__{trevor's staring at something. margaret follows his eye line. jack and the older cop are sitting up, staring at her, just like wally. the redneck stumbles into the barn doorway, also staring at them.}
