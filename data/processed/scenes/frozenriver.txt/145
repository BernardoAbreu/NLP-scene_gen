<C>__{three rivers}
<D>__{probably over at velma's.}
<C>__{rosalie}
<P>__{(to the other chiefs)}
<D>__{what do you think?}

<D>__{we got our own court system.}
<C>__{rosalie}
<D>__{we don't charge people with smuggling.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{maybe we should.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{if we did, we'd have to arrest half the people on the rez.}
<A>__{rosalie and barbara shoot him an angry stare. he shrugs.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{we can expel her.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{you can't start throwin' mohawks off the rez, rosalie. there's only, what, six thousand of us as it is.}
<C>__{rosalie}
<D>__{she makes the mohawk people look bad.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{but she has a mohawk son.}
<C>__{rosalie}
<D>__{she cost us a mohawk son.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{jake was a big boy. he knew what he was doin'}
<C>__{rosalie}

<D>__{we've had smuggling on the rez since al capone.}
<C>__{rosalie}
<D>__{then we'll take a vote.}
