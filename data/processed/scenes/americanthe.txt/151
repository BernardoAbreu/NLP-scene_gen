<L>__{interior autostrada bathroom continuous}
<A>__{mathilde enters a cubicle, opens the case, bypasses the stationary, lifts the false bottom and checks the socimi parts are present and correct. then she loads a magazine.}
<L>__{interior autostrada cafe day}
<A>__{mathilde returns from the bathroom.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{shall we go.}
<A>__{not a question, a command. jack is obliged to stand up.}
<L>__{exterior autostrada, car park day}
<A>__{mathilde walks towards a large ford. she is carrying the briefcase. jack has his right hand in his jacket pocket.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{you won't need your piece.}
<A>__{the slang word belies her. for an instant she has forgotten her belgian accent. she sounds american.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you never know.}
<A>__{she stops beside the ford. jack still has his hands on the walther.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{ok?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sure. you?}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{everything's just fine.}
<A>__{she definitely sounds american now. her right hand slips into her pocket. jack twists his wrist upwards and thumbs the cocking lever.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{final payment.}
<A>__{she hands jack an envelope.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{buy yourself a retirement clock.}
<A>__{her american accent shows that she's letting her guard down. maybe it's designed to make jack do the same. it doesn't.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how do you know i'm retiring?}
<A>__{she leans forward and kisses him lightly and quickly and on the lips.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{have you taken your girl up to the meadow yet?}
<A>__{jack doesn't answer. his whole body is tense for the bullet that he knows his coming. perhaps there is a second person in the car. just then... ...a coach pulls into the car park. it stops with a hydraulic hiss and dozens of teenage kids descend. mathilde looks both irritated and relieved.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<P>__{(whispers to jack)}
<D>__{do it.}
<A>__{she gets into the driver's seat of the ford and swings the briefcase into the back.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{goodbye, mr. butterfly.}
<A>__{jack tenses as mathilde raises her hand in farewell. the ford pulls away and disappears down the slip road onto the autostrada. jack watches it go. thumbs back the lever on his walther. gets into his citroen. and opens the envelope. no wires. no tricks. just a hundred thousand us dollars. jack stares at the money. he isn't supposed to be alive. for a while he stays put. he shuts his eyes in the sunshine and listens to the laughter of the teenage kids. to a girl calling: "amore!" to the cicadas. to the distant rush of traffic on the autostrada.}
