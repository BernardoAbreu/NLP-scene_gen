<L>__{exterior kyichu river night}
<A>__{coracles skin boats are loaded with bundles and people and pushed off the banks and into the water. horses, donkeys and yaks must swim across. tenzin gyatso is helped into a boat. the rowers, wrapped in heavy wool and sheepskin, their arms bare, push off. the boy is sprayed with water. he is bumped about. he is freezing cold. he floats away from lhasa.}
<L>__{exterior countryside day}
<A>__{the caravan journeys through a narrow mountain pass. the flags of tibet and of the dalai lama are carried by mounted soldiers. suddenly, monks come running from the surrounding mountain trails, shrieking, wailing. they run to lamas, grabbing at their robes, clutching, crying out:}
<C>__{monks}
<D>__{do not let him go! we beg of you, do not take him from us!}
<A>__{one monk clutches for an instant at the layman's wrapping on tenzin gyatso but he does not recognize him as the dalai lama the boy tenderly embraces this distraught figure, but the monk drops away from him and clings to the shy, sweet presence of ling rinpoche. the dalai lama is quickly and quietly surrounded by soldiers discreetly, so as not to give away his identity. ling rinpoche speaks to a group.}
<C>__{ling rinpoche}
<D>__{he goes for a short time, until the danger can be determined. he will not leave tibet. he will return.}
<A>__{the pain on these monks's faces, in their voices, is tragic. tenzin gyatso is overwhelmed. he sees before him a line of prostrate monks but they are not bowing to him, they are laying down in the pass, trying to block the way of the caravan. ling rinpoche goes to these men and gently helps them to their feet.}
<C>__{ling rinpoche}
<D>__{he will return. the precious one will not abandon you.}
