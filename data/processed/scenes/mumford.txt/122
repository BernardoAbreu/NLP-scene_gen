<L>__{interior mumford's apartment night}
<A>__{close on a packing carton half full of books. pulling back and floating over other boxes, half packed with mumford's personal belongings he doesn't have a lot. on the bed, an open suitcase with a few clothes thrown in. we're still moving across the room and out onto the porch, to reveal mumford in his chair, nursing a beer, looking up at the starry sky. mumford hears the shower go on downstairs at lily's. then the murmur and giggle of a wet couple.}

<D>__{far out!}
<A>__{mumford smiles. he gets up and goes inside, closing the door behind him so as not to violate their privacy. he goes to the suitcase, takes out some clothes and begins putting them back in the dresser. right now, he's not going anywhere.}
