<L>__{interior max's apartment main room day}
<A>__{max's room is constantly dark because the windows are blacked out. he flips on his desk lamp. a tiny ant crawls across his desk. he looks at it for a moment before getting angry and squashing it. sitting on the desk are three computer monitors, which max flips on. then he pops on more lights and more switches. we pull back revealing that max's apartment looks more like the inside of a computer than a human's home. the room is knee high in computer parts of all shapes and sizes. the walls are covered with circuit boards. cables hang from the ceiling like vines in a brazilian rain forest. they all seem to be wired together forming a monstrous homemade computer. this is euclid, max's creation. the computer is alive with sounds and lights. max works on euclid with his solder and drill. he cares for the machine as if it were his dream car}

<D>__{heat's been getting to euclid. feel it most in the afternoon when i run the set. have to keep the fans on all night from now on. otherwise, everything is running topnotch. the stack of 286's is now faster than columbia's computer science department. i spent a couple hundred dollars. columbia's cost? half a million?}
