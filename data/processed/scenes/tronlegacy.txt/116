<L>__{interior last fighter cache}
<A>__{deteriorating silicon lattice. flynn, rush, krod and fighters arrive to a meager encampment.}
<C>__{code monk n1j}
<D>__{greetings.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{hey guys. this is rush and his main man krod. they defected from plexor's forces to fight with us.}
<A>__{a buzz of hope penetrates gloom. nobody has defected from plexor before.}
<C>__{code monk n1j}
<D>__{we made progress decoding x net's power supply encryption.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{excellent. let's see.}
<A>__{in a make shift lab, code monkeys demonstrate, working at mind boggling speed, assembling a small intricate hologon device (conical pyramid shaped encryption key).}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{i've seen that somewhere.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{it's the encryption pattern on plexor's disk.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{good eyes. we've got mole programs who score chunks of plexor's personal code anywhere they can find it. these guys fit the pieces together.}
<C>__{flynn }
<D>__{it can take a quadrillion combinations.}
<C>__{code monk j2r}
<D>__{we just snagged the last piece, but the battle cost us big time.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{how many of you crashed?}
<A>__{heads shake somberly.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{the teraflop boys? algebrat?}
<C>__{code monk j2r}
<D>__{all that survive, you see standing here.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{oh geez.}
<A>__{flynn falters on his bad leg. quantz and boole support him.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{time is running out!}
<A>__{rush approaches code monkeys as they toil blur speed, trying to fit the final code piece a flat square. pyramidal hologon looks exactly like the x net desk toy we saw in rush's cubicle.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{yow. i get tired just watching these dudes.}
<A>__{rush sees: compilers try to fit the square inside the pyramid.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{just for laughs, try putting the circle on top of the pyramid.}
<C>__{code monks}
<P>__{(unison)}
<D>__{that's incongruous.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{if i'm wrong, ding me.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{what have we got to lose? try it.}
<A>__{code monkeys place the square on top of the pyramid. bingo. square spins into a circle, latches and lights the entire hologon lattice. intricate 3d code patterns animates.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{not bad.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{good thing you didn't terminate us.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{how do we use this thing to shut down plexor?}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(picks up hologon)}
<D>__{it's a copy of plexor's master key. we can break into any x net facility and fry the power supply.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{but once plexor knows we have it, he'll change the code.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{yep. we've got one shot.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{then we should take out the power supply to plexor's main server.}
<C>__{group}
<D>__{yes! take out plexor's central server!}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{hang on, guys, that's not as easy as it sounds }
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{i was inside the main server, i saw how it's laid out.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{i used to work there! i will recognize where everything is!}
<C>__{code monk n1j}
<D>__{we can take it!}
<C>__{code monk j2r}
<D>__{hit plexor where he lives!}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{even with this key, it won't }
<C>__{quantz}
<D>__{we can pull it off, can't we flynn? one final assault on plexor's central server?}
<C>__{boole}
<D>__{shut him down forever?}
<A>__{all eyes on flynn. rush's naivete has ignited false hope in the fighters.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{of course we can.}
<A>__{flynn forces a smile.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{hey, the future depends on us. how could we fail?}
