<A>__{a wall of tv monitors, each monitor showing joey sitting on a couch with a painfully thin older woman brittany vertue. brittany's probably 50 but her face is as tight and smooth as surgery can make it. she is dressed in the standard uniform of the health avatar; brightly colored leotard over black tights. joey has a big paperback book beyond hunger; the brittany vertue guide to holistic dieting which she holds to camera. she smiles and, turning to face brittany, crosses her legs. the image freezes. and replays. joey crosses her legs again. and again. and again.}
