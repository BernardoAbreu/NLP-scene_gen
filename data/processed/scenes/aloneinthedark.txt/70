<A>__{aline and carnby quietly come out a service door that leads to the ceramics room. they conceal themselves behind a pair of columns, scanning the area before they step out. the lights are dim, with long shadows stretching out through the area. aline is about to speak, but carnby puts a finger to his mouth and shakes his head, no. the dead body of the guard lies in a pool of blood on the ground. there seems to be no one else around. but then, silently, moving with a fluid grace, a xenomorph creature emerges out of the shadows. the xenomorph creature is huge, terrifying. it is seven feet tall, covered in thick, dark scales. it stands on two legs, with long, powerful arms that end in razor sharp claws and a segmented, spiked tail poised behind it. its demonic head has black, sunken eyes and a severe jaw lined with jagged, fang like teeth. the head is identical to the stone carving in which the lynchpin artifact was encased. carnby and aline look shocked. they freeze, not moving a muscle. another xenomorph creature steps out of the shadows. the two creatures congregate in the middle of the room. they are the same hulking, grotesque brutes. the two creatures start to communicate. an unintelligible language passes between them. suddenly, one of the creatures looks up, sensing something. the creature looks directly at carnby and aline, hiding behind the columns. the creature delivers a sharp whisper. and with that, the creature fades into invisibility. it has totally disappeared. the second creature immediately follows suit, also fading invisible.}

<A>__{carnby and aline scramble to their feet and sprint back towards the service door. an invisible creature comes racing after them. all that is visible is the effect of the creature's movement. it knocks over a statue as it chases after them. the statue smashes to the ground. aline is through the door. carnby runs through it and aline pulls it closed behind them.}
