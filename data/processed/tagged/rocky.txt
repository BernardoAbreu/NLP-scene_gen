<A>__{ring productions, inc. master script: includes all revisions as of 1 7 76 revised:}
<L>__{interior blue door fight club night}
<A>__{superimpose over action... "november 12, 1975 philadelphia" ... the club itself resembles a large unemptied trash can. the boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle. the lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is fighting. in the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black. the white fighter is rocky balboa. he is thirty years old. his face is scarred and thick around the nose... his black hair shines and hangs in his eyes. rocky fights in a plodding, machine like style. the black fighter dances and bangs combinations into rocky's face with great accuracy. but the punches do not even cause rocky to blink... he grins at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead. the people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for blood... they lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters. in the thick smoke they resemble spectres. everyone is hustling bets... the action is even heavier in the balcony. a housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet. the bell rings and the fighters return to their corner... somebody heaves a beer can into the ring. the black fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers across the ring at rocky.}
<C>__{black fighter}
<P>__{(to cornerman)}
<D>__{... i'm gonna bust his head wide open!}
<A>__{in rocky's corner he is being assisted by a shriveled, balding cornerman, who is an employee of the club... he works on rocky without any enthusiasm.}
<C>__{cornerman}
<P>__{(lackluster)}
<D>__{... ya waltzin' give the suckers some action.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{hey }
<C>__{cornerman}
<P>__{(overriding)}
<D>__{ya movin' like a bum want some advice }
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{... just gimme the water.}
<A>__{a fight fan rushes up to rocky... he is sixty five, with yellow teeth and wearing sunglasses.}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{should i bet the fight don't go the distance ya feel strong?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{cornerman}
<D>__{... ya want some good advice?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{... i just want the mouthpiece.}
<A>__{the bell rings... rocky makes the sign of the cross. the fighters engage in battle. the other fighter grabs rocky in a clinch and purposely butts him... the butt opens a bleeding cut on the corner of rocky's eye. rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into the man's body... rocky slams the man on the jaw and the fighter is out for the night. the fans throw rubbish into the ring. rocky ignores it. the fans loudly go about collecting bets. the referee does not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher. two new fighters enter the ring. rocky slips on a tattered robe. embroidered clumsily on the back is, "the italian stallion."}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{winner, rocky balboa next a six rounder between local lightweights.}
<A>__{without pomp rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a cigarette from a spectator... the fighter on the stretcher passes behind him. he watches for a moment and continues up the aisle... before he even reaches the rear of the club the bell rings and the next fight has already begun... rocky fades into the darkness of the rear of the club.}
<T>__{the title credits end:}
<L>__{interior dressing room night}
<A>__{rocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his locker for his hat... also in the dingy room are ten other fighters... two taped fighters talk shop in the corner.}
<D>__{fighter #1 ... tomorrow me an' my woman are gonna tip on down to atlantic city, man. fighter #2 ... it's cold, bro'. fighter #1 ... that's right, i got the city to myself...}
<A>__{another paces nervously... two other fighters shadowbox and spit nervously on the floor. a young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable radio that is blasting music. the fighter that rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer and joking with three other fighters... some of the fighters are smoking. the room is cloudy. a short man of fifty enters. he is dressed in a sweater buttoned over a t shirt.}
<C>__{promoter}
<D>__{...balboa!?}
<A>__{rocky raises his head. the promoter steps over.}
<C>__{promoter}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{... twenty bucks for the locker an' cornerman two bucks for the towel an' shower, seven for tax the house owes ya, sixty one dollars.}
<A>__{the man peels off the money and departs... rocky closes his locker, nods to the defeated fighter, and leaves.}
<L>__{interior trolley night}
<A>__{rocky is on the trolley heading to south philly... the trolley is empty except for a thin old black woman... the black woman studies rocky's bruised face... rocky becomes self conscious.}
<C>__{rocky}
<P>__{(almost apologetic)}
<D>__{i'm a fighter.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(tired)}
<D>__{... yo' iz an accident.}
<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{rocky exits the trolley and walks down the block... he waves at a pair of high heeled hookers and they wave back. rocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty bookstore. rocky drags the man into a protective passageway. further down the street, rocky pauses in front of the "animal town pet shop"... he peers into the dark store and sees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window. he mumbles to the dog and continues to the corner.}
<L>__{exterior rocky's apartment night}
<A>__{a short while later, rocky approaches his apartment located in the most deprived section of south philly. he kicks away the litter that has gathered against the apartment steps and enters.}
<L>__{interior rocky's hallway night}
<A>__{the narrow hallway is painted olive brown. a single light bulb illuminates the gloomy corridor.}
<L>__{interior rocky's apartment night}
<A>__{rocky enters. the one room apartment is drab, with a curling boxing poster of rocky marciano tacked on the wall... nailed against the far wall is a mattress. the mattress is used as a punching bag. stuffing spills out of the center. rocky drops his coat on the floor. he puts on a pair of glasses. he crosses to a small turtle bowl... he lifts the creatures.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{...look who's home.}
<A>__{rocky starts to boil a pan of water on his hot plate, then places an old 45 rpm record on a battered phonograph. the record is a tune, "all in the game." ... as the crackling music begins, rocky picks up his hairbrush. using it like a microphone, he mimes to the record. he assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning to thousands of adoring fans... he then switches into a bullish fighting stance and throws several punches. the water boils. rocky soaks his badly swollen hands.}
<L>__{exterior sunrise of philadelphia skyline dawn}
<A>__{we see the jagged skyline, highlighted by the towering figure of william penn that rises above the dawn haze as it sits majestically above city hall...}
<L>__{exterior docks early morning}
<A>__{rocky is walking along the waterfront... he has a bandaid over one eye. he looks at the rugged stevedores going about their business... he stuffs his hands in his cheap wool jacket and approaches a ship being unloaded. rocky passes two thick mafia types leaning against a parked car. these men look like blood drinkers.}
<D>__{mafia #1 yo, rock how's your boss?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{real good. mafia #2 fightin' again?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{yeah, here an' there. mafia #1 mebbe we make sum money togather soon... give ya boss my best.}
<A>__{rocky shrugs and moves away... he nears a heavy man working the crane. the heavy man looks frightened... he stops the crane and hurries into the ship's hole. rocky dashes up the gangplank.}
<L>__{interior ship day}
<A>__{the man enters the ship's hole and runs past tons of stacked crates and coffee beans. rocky sprints after him... he lunges and flings the man by the neck against the wall of stacked cargo.}
<C>__{fats}
<P>__{(terror filled)}
<D>__{don't hit the face! not the face!!}

<C>__{fats}
<D>__{please, i need my hands to work christ, don't bust my thumbs.}
<A>__{at wits' end the man picks up a large metal hook used by stevedores. rocky remains cool.}

<D>__{look, bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band if ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... me, i ain't emotionally involved.}
<A>__{rocky's determined expression strikes home. the fat man quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small wad of bills.}

<A>__{the man extends his coat again... rocky suddenly grabs the man's thumb and bends him to his knees.}
<C>__{fats}
<P>__{(almost a whisper)}
<D>__{no no no please please please don't...}
<A>__{rocky releases the man who remains almost in shock. the thumb is fine.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{...that's what coulda happened.}
<P>__{(walks off.)}
<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{later that morning rocky passes "animal town pet shop" in south philly... the shop is not very prosperous looking. in the window hangs a sign reading "today's special mixed kittens $1.50"... rocky stops at this shop every morning. he stares at a litter of lhasa apsa puppies. he taps the window and whistles. he sees a girl behind the counter and presses his face against the window and does his impression of the hunchback of notre dame. the girl nervously looks away. the girl behind the counter is adrian klein. she is not very attractive, but pleasant looking. thirty years old. brown hair pulled back. light skinned. she wears glasses. rocky really stops by to flirt with adrian, but she is so painfully shy nothing ever gets started... rocky enters.}
<L>__{interior pet shop day}

<A>__{mickey's gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy spoons. out front a crowd of young blacks talk and jive among themselves. two winos lean against the entrance. rocky enters the gym... the place is nearly full. the measured beat of skip ropes and throbbing speed bags makes the room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of machinery. over the loudspeaker music by the isley brothers blares out... the music adds a background to the clang of the automatic timers, snorting sparring partners and the thudding of heavy bags. the room is divided fifty percent black thirty five percent latin ten percent white five percent other. as rocky walks through the gym many of the fighters pause to wave and yell greetings.}

<A>__{rocky stands at the base of an overwhelmingly steep flight of stairs. he stares up at the stairs that nearly disappear into the morning gray. taking a deep breath, he starts up. from the start, he looks out of shape and halfway up his legs give way. standing, he brushes off and descends the stairs.}
<L>__{exterior city hall dawn}
<A>__{rocky passes city hall and veers to the river. he pauses, heaving great gusts of exhausted breaths. he throws several lazy jabs in the air and walks awhile with hands on his aching sides. men delivering the morning papers observe with amusement. rocky forces himself to begin running again.}

<A>__{paulie reddens. he steps forward and slams his fists in a hanging beef. the punching of the beef is a muted challenge and rocky responds. rocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs. the grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging corpse. rocky moves to the next one and hooks. rocky's face reveals a never before seen concentration, as though he were locked in total battle.}
