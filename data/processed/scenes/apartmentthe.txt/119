<A>__{bud is in the process of packing. in the middle of the living room are several large cardboard cartons filled with his possessions. the art posters are off the walls, the bric a brac has been removed from the shelves, and bud is stowing away the last of his books and records. he crosses to the fireplace, opens one of the drawers in the cabinet above it, takes out a forty five automatic. he holds the gun in the palm of his hand, studies it appraisingly. the doorbell rings. bud snaps out of his reverie, drops the gun into one of the cartons, goes to the door and opens it. standing outside is dr. dreyfuss, with a plastic ice bucket in his hand.}
