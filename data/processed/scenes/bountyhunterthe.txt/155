<A>__{suddenly, she hears groaning coming from inside. or grunting. like someone trying to call out through a gag. she looks around. there is a window higher up on the wall. cass drags a trash can beneath the window, stacks another one on top of it, and cautiously climbs up. the window is locked and she can't see through it. hmm. fuck it. she takes her purse and smashes a pane of glass. she wobbles on trash cans and grabs the windowsill just as the cans fall away, leaving her dangling.}
