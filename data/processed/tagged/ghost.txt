<D>__{"ghost" screenplay by bruce joel rubin}
<C>__{shooting draft}
<L>__{interior tribeca loft day}
<A>__{the camera tracks slowly through clouds of moving dust. shafts of muted light pierce the dense atmosphere. an eerie netherworld envelops us. strange ghostly forms appear and disappear in the distance. they seem like apparitions. broken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the smoky light. we see hints of a huge demolished space. an old white plaster wall fills the screen. momentary blips of light flash across it. sounds of street traffic are heard dimly in the distance. with startling impact, the sound of a sledgehammer explodes out of nowhere. the wall shudders. hammer blows assault the audience. they are loud and jarring. the wall buckles. chunks of plaster crash to the floor. the air fills with new swirls of white dust. the sledgehammer smashes into view. beams of sunlight cut through the cracks, piercing the atmosphere like searchlights in a fog. a huge section of wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the air. we hear voices talking.}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{what a mess!}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i told you!}
<A>__{through jagged holes we can make out three dim figures on the other side of the wall, all wielding sledgehammers.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i can't breathe.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{use your mask, dummy.}
<A>__{one of the figures adjusts something over his face. isolated rays of sunlight dance around him casting long shadows in the air.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"volga boat..., man." whoomph!}
<A>__{his hammer pounds the wall. molly laughs.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{the camera moves in and for the first time we see them. molly jensen, in her late 20's, has a bandanna around her hair and a workman's mask over her nose, but we can tell from her eyes and cheekbones that she is beautiful. sam wheat, in his late 30's, is also hidden behind a mask, but he has a strong forehead and handsome features. sweat is dripping down his brow, leaving streaks in the dust. carl bruner, early 30's, removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a fashionable two day stubble. both men have their shirts off.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{blackness and a loud thud. suddenly a shaft of light penetrates the darkness. another thud and more light. we see a hole. the hook of a crowbar enters it, grappling with something around the edges. then, with a tug and a loud yank, a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor. huge clouds of dust fly into the air. molly looks up, astonished.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{sam, look, there's a whole eight feet up there.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and about eighty years of dust.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{we have all this height, sam. we could add a second floor and put our bedroom upstairs. that would leave all this space.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(eyeing her curiously)}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{for space. just space.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{be great for bumper cars.}
<A>__{carl laughs as he looks at sam. their bodies, covered with white powder, appear as strange, ghostly figures.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{sam, this may be none of my business, but i'm concerned you're doing too much coke.}
<A>__{sam glances down at his white body. they all laugh.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{hey, sam, turn around.}
<A>__{sam obeys. molly doodles on his chest, drawing a bow tie and the outline of a tuxedo jacket. her lines are quick, accomplished, and subtly erotic.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(offering his body)}
<D>__{how 'bout me?}
<A>__{molly nods. she reaches out and superimposes an armless female torso over his. his stomach jumps sensually as she touches it. molly pulls back to admire her work. he looks like a greek statue.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i will never wash again.}
<A>__{molly laughs.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{sam, molly, and carl are holding their sledgehammers. molly begins to count.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{all together now. one,}
<P>__{(they strike the wall}
<D>__{with their hammers.}
<P>__{the wall shakes)}
<D>__{two,}
<P>__{(they pound again.}
<D>__{the wall begins to}
<P>__{give)}
<D>__{three.}
<A>__{in unison, they hit it once more. a massive section of plaster and metal topples to the ground. new clouds of dust fill the air. suddenly, sam spies an old jar lying on the floor. something rattles inside it, a penny.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hey, look what i found. there's a penny inside.}
<P>__{(he hands it to molly)}
<D>__{for luck in our new loft. it's a good omen.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(shaking her head, disagreeing)}
<D>__{you're the good omen.}
<A>__{she glances at him lovingly. carl looks at the two of them and grins. as the dust settles we see, for the first time, the outlines of the space they are working in. it is a huge loft over four thousand square feet. banks of windows run east and west. molly steps back and admires the room.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{it's gorgeous.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you guys lucked out. hell, i bet you could sell it tomorrow and double your investment.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{sell it? carl, we just bought it.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what i wouldn't do for a place like this.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's gonna be great.}

<L>__{exterior market security bank & trust headquarters day}
<A>__{it is morning rush hour. sam and carl, both wearing suits and ties, exit the wall street subway station and approach the headquarters of market security bank & trust.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{oh, by the way, sam, i had to move your 3:00 with bob kahan to 4:00 so you could squeeze in gary alan. he called yesterday and said he has to see you today about the danway stuff. three o'clock was the only time he could make it. also, the board meeting in l.a. has been confirmed for the 12th. i got you on a 9:00 a.m. flight.}
<A>__{sam seems preoccupied.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey, sam, relax. this isn't brain surgery you're going into.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i hate pitching to these japanese guys. they make me nervous. i mean, what am i supposed to say, "who do you think'll win that big sumo championship"?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{sam, you'll be fine. you're great with people.}
<A>__{sam's jacket flares open. he is wearing yellow suspenders. carl notices.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey, nice. i like those.}
<A>__{sam, not completely comfortable wearing them, buttons his jacket.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{...molly.}
<A>__{carl smiles and then turns to admire a car going by.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{jesus, look at that, a testerossa. that's the car i'm gonna drive when i'm making two hundred grand.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{better pay off your mustang first.}
<L>__{interior bank headquarters, elevator day}
<A>__{sam and carl are standing on a crowded elevator. it is deadly quiet. suddenly carl elbows sam and winks. there is something he wants him to do. sam hesitates a moment, annoyed, and then relents. he clears his throat.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{so carl, what did the doctor say?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{he said it was contagious. very contagious. i shouldn't be going into work today.}
<P>__{(he coughs loudly)}
<D>__{but what could i do?}
<A>__{he sneezes. people on the elevator freeze.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and what about the rash?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{not good. it's spreading everywhere.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{on your genitals again?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{everywhere. he said be sure not to touch anyone.}
<A>__{we see people trying to inch away. carl coughs again. they hold their breath. the elevator stops at the next floor. all the passengers get off.}
<L>__{interior bank headquarters, executive offices day}
<A>__{sam and carl, laughing, walk through a large office area bustling with activity. employees, in various cubicles, are talking on telephones and punching information into computers. sam heads into his executive office. carl steps into a cubicle across the aisle. rose, sam's secretary, approaches him.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{morning, mr. wheat.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{morning rose. listen, when the kobiashi people arrive, have elenore take them right to the...}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{they're already here.}
<A>__{she points to a windowed conference room. sam turns around and sees a large group of japanese men standing inside.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{they're early!}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i know. and andy dillon called. he said they need $900,000 transferred to albany by noon.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{noon? damn!}
<A>__{he hurries over to carl's cubicle. he is on the phone. carl cups the mouthpiece.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hold on.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{listen, dillon needs $900,000 in albany by noon. can you transfer it to his payroll account?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{sure. just let me have your mac code.}
<A>__{sam pulls out his wallet and extracts a small address book. he jots the code numbers on a piece of paper and hands it to carl.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{discretion, huh?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you bet. i will do it right away.}
<L>__{interior well appointed executive boardroom day}
<A>__{sam and a group of fifteen somber japanese businessmen are sitting around a large granite conference table. sam stands up and speaks a simple greeting to them.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(in japanese)}
<D>__{good morning, gentlemen. on behalf of market security bank & trust, i welcome you to our city.}
<A>__{the men smile happily and nod their heads in unison.}
<C>__{men}
<D>__{arigato.}
<A>__{they look to sam, expecting more. uncomfortable, he clears his throat.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm afraid that's the only japanese i know. but i realize it's not our language fluency, or lack of it, that brings you to market security. rather, i'm sure, it is our banking expertise, our ability to represent and anticipate all of your banking needs. as you know, we are not the largest banking establishment in new york.}
<P>__{(his throat goes dry}
<D>__{and he takes a sip}
<P>__{of water)}
<D>__{but, with combined assets of over 200 billion dollars, we have a firm commitment to the international marketplace.}
<A>__{a secretary enters the room and hands sam a piece of paper. it reads "molly on line 2. urgent." she hands him a phone. sam looks surprised. he nods apologetically to his guests.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<P>__{(he picks up the receiver)}
<D>__{hello?}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{molly}
<A>__{dressed in a long, clay covered smock. she is in a potters studio. several other potters are in the background working at their wheels. a five foot high ceramic vase stands beside molly. it is still wet. she toys with it as she speaks into the phone.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{a man and a woman are lying in bed when the woman's husband suddenly comes home. frightened, she tells the man he has to leave instantly through the window. he has no time to dress.}
<T>__{cut back to:}
<B>__{sam}
<A>__{straight faced, listening and trying to look as if it is important.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{uh hmm.}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{it's raining outside. the man, running naked along the street, sees some joggers approaching.}
<A>__{the entire contingent of japanese men is staring at sam.}
<C>__{molly }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{one of the joggers calls out. "hey, do you always go jogging naked?" and the man says, "yes, always."}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{and then the other jogger says, "and do you always wear a condom?" the man looks down, embarrassed, and replies, "only when it's raining."}
<A>__{sam squelches a smile.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well, that's just fine.}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{now just relax and have fun, okay? it's not the end of the world if you lose this account. you've always got me.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{thank you. i will remember that.}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{see ya.}
<A>__{he hangs up and stares at the japanese men. a short smile crosses his face.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{a carved wooden angel}
<A>__{eight feet tall, ascending into an afternoon sky. as the camera pulls back we see that we are inside a building and that the angel is dangling outside an open doorway high above the street. a group of workmen grab for the angel, but have difficulty bringing it in. suddenly molly steps into the frame.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{where you guys from, the new york city ballet?}
<A>__{with a gutsy maneuver, molly leans out over the sidewalk and tries to grab hold of the ropes. she can't reach them. suddenly a pair of hands grabs her around the waist. she screams.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{saved your life.}
<A>__{sam laughs as he pulls her back into the loft. she does not think it is funny.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you bastard. don't do that to me. you scared me half to death.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{better than seeing this gorgeous body splattered all over the street. here, look out.}
<A>__{sam jumps up, grabs hold of the door's top molding, and swings out over the sidewalk. molly gasps. sam's feet push at the angel and send it swinging away and then back toward the loft. quickly he jumps back, grabs hold of it, and brings it in. the workmen applaud. molly eyes him with admiration. suddenly we hear a voice call out.}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{sam? molly? anybody home?}
<A>__{molly looks to sam.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{carl? did you invite him?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{i couldn't keep him away.}
<A>__{carl enters, shakes molly's hand, and pats sam on the back.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hi, moll. hi, sam. so, how's it goin?}
<A>__{before they can answer, a workman turns to molly.}
<C>__{workman }
<D>__{where do you want this?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{in the bedroom.}
<L>__{interior loft day}
<A>__{as the angel pulls away from camera, we see the newly decorated loft for the first time. it is painted now in lovely pastels. the floor, a huge gymnasium like expanse, is lacquered with polyurethane. furniture and boxes are piling up along the walls. dominating the space, with a kind of surreal presence, are a large number of molly's sculptures and ceramics. there is also a vintage jukebox. carl is impressed.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{wow! the place looks great. really great.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you like it, huh?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{"like" is hardly the word. i never imagined it would be this beautiful. this is incredible.}
<A>__{a mover lugs in a heavy old chair. molly sees it.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{sam, you kept that chair?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what do you mean? it's comfortable. for t.v. i love that chair.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{but it doesn't go with anything.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it goes with me.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{it's okay, i will paint it.}
<A>__{sam pinches her ass. molly smiles.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day later}
<A>__{sam, molly, and carl are sprawled out on the floor, eating from cartons of chinese food. frank, a gray cat, eats beside them. unpacked boxes are scattered everywhere.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it was the middle of december. i was sitting in my old office, the one charlie's in. suddenly, i heard this woman screaming. i thought someone'd been shot or something.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{they took away my mastercard. it was christmas, for godssake.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{she was four thousand dollars over her limit.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{it wasn't four thousand. and i'd already sent in the payment! you're the ones that lost it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{she's still angry.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{no i'm not.}
<A>__{the cat begins nibbling sam's food.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{get outta here, frank!}
<P>__{(the cat scampers away)}
<D>__{you should have seen her. all pink and flushed. her skin was gorgeous, like a rose. and she's screaming, demanding to see the president. so wilton brought her to me.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you? you weren't even a vp yet.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{she didn't know that.}
<A>__{carl smiles.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{can you believe it? and the next thing i know, he's telling me his life story. i couldn't believe it. everything. about his divorce, how he'd just arrived in new york, how he didn't know any women. and all with this montana accent.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's a montana accent?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{the one you always slip into it when you get nervous. "yes, ma'am. thank you, ma'am. can i fondle your breasts, ma'am?"}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i wasn't nervous.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{admit it. you liked me. you were interested.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(matter of factly)}
<D>__{i thought you were cute.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{cute?}
<P>__{(looking at carl)}
<D>__{do you believe this? i should have been picasso's mistress. i should have been living in barcelona or paris. but no, i'm moving in with a new york banker who thinks i'm cute.}
<A>__{she looks at sam and grins. carl is staring at molly, obviously turned on by her. he is embarrassed when she catches his gaze and quickly looks away.}

<L>__{interior molly's studio night}
<A>__{molly, dressed only in a t shirt, is sitting at her potters wheel throwing a series of pots. sam enters the studio. he is barefoot, shirtless, wearing jeans.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i felt inspired.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{at 2:00 am?}
<A>__{she nods and presses her hands into a pot that is forming in front of her. sam watches the sensual movement of her fingers, molding and forming the clay. she is forceful, assured, gifted. the clay responds to her slightest effort. slowly, almost unconsciously, sam reaches for her shoulders and begins kissing them.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you notice carl's eyes today? they were all over you.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{what? are you jealous? sam, let me tell you something. he's not even looking at me. it's you he idolizes. he doesn't see me at all... anyway, he's not my type.}
<A>__{sam reaches over her and gently adds his fingers to the clay. molly looks up at him.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i feel inspired.}
<A>__{his hands dig into the clay. molly smiles. their fingers seem to dance together. after a moment, she reaches up to him, her clay covered fingers streaking his face and curving down to his chest. sam grins and reaches down to her.}
<T>__{match cut to:}
<A>__{sam's finger as it presses two buttons on his jukebox. we watch as the mechanical arm selects a record and slowly, sensuously, lowers it to the turntable. the arm hovers over the record and then descends. it begins to play. the song is "unchained melody" by the righteous brothers.}
<B>__{sam and molly}
<A>__{are dancing in the middle of the dark loft. moonlight pours through the windows and shines off the floor. wads of packing paper swirl sensuously around their feet. molly runs her fingers down sam's naked back. the moment is sweet and erotic. we watch as sam slowly draws his fingers down over molly's face, gently caressing her forehead, her eyes, her lips. sam slides his hands under molly's t shirt, slowly moving them toward her breasts. her breathing slows. they dance silently, her hair swaying in the soft light. we hear the sounds of their bare feet on the highly polished floor. sensuously, molly's shirt lifts above her navel as sam presses into her. their stomachs touch and part and touch again. she bites her lip. sam eyes her moonlit form as she strokes his chest, slowly moving her fingers down his torso, around the curve of his hips, and then digging into the back of his jeans. sam leans into molly and nips at her neck. she stops dancing. her eyes close. she stands absolutely still. sam's hands move to her backside. he pulls her closer.}
<T>__{dissolve:}
<A>__{livingroom night sam and molly, making love on the livingroom carpet. paper and packing materials crumble beneath them and scatter across the floor. for all their sensuality, it is their hands and eyes that are most expressive, revealing a tenderness that is deeply moving. their lovemaking is full of love.}
<B>__{jukebox}
<A>__{the song ends. the jukebox arm retracts and gently slides the record back into its slot.}
<T>__{dissolve:}

<A>__{bedroom night sam and molly are lying together silently. molly gazes at him.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{the matter?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i can tell.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{nothing... really.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you're worried, aren't you? about moving in together?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no. not really.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{then what? the promotion?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't know. a lot of things. i just don't want the bubble to burst... whenever something good happens to me i'm just afraid i'm going to lose it.}
<A>__{molly gently strokes his head.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you know what?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i love you. i really love you.}
<A>__{he smiles and strokes her cheek.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{ditto.}
<A>__{suddenly the t.v. blares into the room. sam jumps up, grabbing the remote control unit from under his buttocks. molly laughs as he turns the sound down. the news is on and they are showing the remains of an airline disaster. sam stares at the tube.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{oh jesus. another one.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{don't watch that stuff.}
<A>__{he motions to wait. dead bodies litter the screen.}
<C>__{correspondent}
<D>__{...it is estimated that 34 people died in the crash, the second in less than two weeks.}
<A>__{the t.v. goes off. sam, confused, spins around. molly is holding the remote control. she nods for him to lie down.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i should cancel my l.a. trip... these things always happen in threes.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{threes? sam, get serious. besides, you lead a charmed life.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah. so did they.}
<A>__{sam looks at her and then back at the screen.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{amazing, huh?}
<P>__{(he snaps his fingers)}
<D>__{just like that. blackout.}
<L>__{exterior wall street establishing shot day}

<L>__{interior sam's office day}
<A>__{sam is sitting at his computer. his address book with his access codes is sitting open beside him. he seems perplexed by something happening on the screen. after pushing a series of buttons and getting the same response, he whacks the computer on the side. carl, walking in the door, sees him. sam looks up sheepishly.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{a glitch. what's up?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{the mark greenberg and larry white accounts. i can't get in. your mac code doesn't work.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i changed it.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{why? what's up?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{nothing. i just want to nose around a bit... can you keep your mouth shut?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yeah, sure. tell me, what's going on.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i think i've stumbled onto something. there's too much money in these accounts.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{too much money. that's ridiculous. how could there be too much money?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's what i keep asking myself.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{it must be the computer.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i've been checking.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yeah, mr. fixit.}
<P>__{(he hits the computer}
<D>__{like sam did and}
<P>__{laughs)}
<D>__{come on, move over. let me see what i can do.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{not yet. i'm gonna dig around a bit.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{okay, okay. just call me when you're ready for help.}
<P>__{(he heads for the door)}
<D>__{so, what are you and moll doing tonight?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we're going to the theatre. she wants to see "macbeth" at the spring street repertory.}
<A>__{carl winces. sam smiles.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i loved it.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i could tell.}
<A>__{she smiles and squeezes his arm. they walk silently down a dark street, heading toward their loft. the pavement is full of shadows.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{did i tell you what marcia said?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{six times.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{six? no i didn't. sam, don't be so blase. i will have two major pieces in the show. the new york times reviews her gallery all the time. this could be huge.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{molly, the "new york times" is some frustrated little critic with pimples on his ass who flunked out of art school. who cares what the new york times thinks?}
<C>__{molly}

<A>__{in a wild explosive fury, sam charges at carl and smashes at his gun. the weapon flies out of carl's hand. empowered by an anger we have not seen before, sam smashes into carl with a violent force. carl's body careens into walls and floorboards. wiring snaps. two by fours crack. carl, crawling desperately to escape, sees his gun on the floor. with a wild rush, he grabs for it and shoots at the door. the lock explodes and the door flies open. carl tries to run for it, but sam cuts in front of him. with growing power, sam sends carl flying back into the apartment, colliding into a tall scaffold. bags of plaster topple to the ground as mounds of plaster dust hurl into the air. the apartment looks like a scene from another world. carl, in a state of total unrelieved panic, breaks away from sam. the dust obscures his escape. like a trapped insect, he scrambles furiously to the fire escape window. sam cannot see him. carl shoves at the window. it is stuck. with a supreme effort, he grabs a ripped bag of plaster and swings it at the glass. half of its plaster spews across the room before smashing the window. shards of glass fly in all directions. sam turns and sees carl. he surges after him, but knows he cannot get to him in time. carl is halfway out the window when sam's fist slams into an electrical box attached to a dangling bx cable. it goes flying toward the window. to his amazement, it hits the frame. a huge pane of glass dislodges and comes crashing down. carl looks up just in time to see the pointed edge aiming for his chest. before he can move, it pierces him between the ribs and slices into his heart. his body quivers. carl's eyes bulge from their sockets. his body begins to spasm. he can't get up. a look of abject terror flashes through his eyes. he tries to scream. there is no sound. he tries to breathe. there is no breath.}

<A>__{with one last effort, carl lurches forward. to his amazement, his body stands up and pulls away from the window. he looks down at his chest and is amazed to see that the glass is gone. there is no blood. excited and confused, he turns around and sees sam. for a moment, he cannot comprehend what is happening.}

<D>__{sam?}
<A>__{there is a strange, silent moment between them. then, seemingly out of nowhere, a terrible clicking sound is heard. frightening black forms are emerging from the darkness. carl looks behind him and gasps. past the figures coming toward him, he sees his own dead body. it is pinned to the window sill. before carl can cry out, the dark figures swoop down and envelope him. in a flash, his spirit is caught and surges with the dark forces back into the shadows. far in some invisible distance, we can barely hear him scream. and then it is silent. it is over.}

<A>__{molly is crouched in the corner, her back pressed tightly against the wall. she is staring into space. the room is filled with plaster dust. slowly, emerging from the dust, we see sam approaching molly. he gazes at her with terrible longing. suddenly, a brilliant light glows from behind the ceiling and the skylight floods the room with a golden haze. sam turns to look at it. his eyes are full of surprise and wonder. the spirits beyond the ceiling are beckoning to him. as he looks down, he notices that his hands are growing transparent. his body is beginning to fade. a faint smile forms on his face. he leans down toward molly, staring at her for a long, silent moment.}

<D>__{i can't stay anymore.}

<A>__{we see sam's spirit rise from the room. it passes effortlessly through the ceiling and, in seconds, he is gone. the room grows dark. molly sits quietly on the floor. there is a look of awe and wonder in her eyes. after a moment, oda mae reaches down to help her up. molly looks at her lovingly and then gently takes her hand. arm in arm, supporting one another, they walk quietly from the room.}
