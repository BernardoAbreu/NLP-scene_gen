<L>__{interior paul's bedroom. night}
<A>__{paul's light sweeps across the room and illuminates: eyes terrified eyes, a room full of faces, staring back. their pov: a dark figure behind a blinding light. the dog breaks free, runs to paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{pealiss!}
<A>__{from among the faces, tatiana's voice heavy with relief.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{paul!}
<A>__{paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. then he sees their friends odette and her husband jean baptiste.}

<D>__{our great president is murdered, by the tutsi cockroaches. they tricked him, then they killed him. we must cleanse this country, good hutus of rwanda. we must clear the brush. clear the brush of all cockroaches. clear the brush!!!}
<A>__{the words are cut short as a grenade blast rattles the window. everyone jumps, children whimper. paul is shocked but tries to pull things together.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{come on, everyone out of this room, find a seat in the living room.}
<A>__{he holds the door open, they file out, frightened. tatiana is last, he stops her, steps back in, closes the door.}
