<L>__{interior siwash cave night}
<A>__{sissy listens to the chink as they walk around the chink's clockworks.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{these people have no other ritual than this one. likewise, they have but one legend or cultural myth: that of a continuum they call the eternity of joy. it is into the eternity of joy that they believe all men will pass once the clockworks is destroyed. the destruction must come from the outside, must come by natural means, must come at the will of this gesticulating planet whose more acute stirrings thoughtless people call "earthquakes."}
<A>__{the chink holds sissy's thumbs in his hands adoringly.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{the earth is alive. she burns inside with the heat of cosmic longing. she longs to be with her husband again. she moans. she turns softly in her sleep. in the eternity of joy, pluralized, deurbanized man, at ease with his gentle technologies, will smile and sigh when the earth begins to shake. i loved those loony redskins, but i couldn't be a party to their utopian dreaming. after a while it occurred to me that the clock people waiting for the eternity of joy was virtually identical to the christians waiting for the second coming. or the communists waiting for the worldwide revolution. or the debbies waiting for the flying saucers. all the same. just more suckers betting their share of the present on the future, banking every misery on a happy ending to history. well, history is ending every second happily for some of us, unhappily for others, happily one second, unhappily the nexterior history is always ending and always not ending... ha ha ho ho and hee hee.}
<A>__{sissy interrupts the chink for a second while he is worshipping her thumbs.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{what do you believe in then?}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{ha ha ho ho and hee hee.}
<A>__{then he says nothing. and his silence makes sissy weep. they sit down on a grass floor, illuminated by the fire outside the cave. then the chink, without hesitation, grasps her thumbs. he squeezes them, caresses them, covers them with wet kisses, telling them how beautiful they are. sissy is bowled over, frightened, stunned, elated, moved almost to tears. sissy bends her head back and whispers.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{if this be adultery, make the most of it.}
<A>__{and as the chink plunges into sissy, she arches her spread bottom against the blankets and rears up to meet him halfway. their bodies glowing in the firelight, they cast shadows of ancient beings, anthropomorphs making love through the night under the moon.}
