<LOC>__{EXT.  HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The soundtrack opens with Frank Sinatra's "Fly Me to the Moon". A HELICOPTER SHOT OF THE L.A. basin. The pool of golden light disintegrates into the thousands of points which constitute it as we rapidly draw closer to the city. We are just above the tops of the highest buildings as we approach Hollywood Boulevard.  Below is neon and the icy thrust of search lights rotating on the corner of Hollywood and Vine. We continue west, then quickly north. There is the momentary appearance of the moonlit HOLLYWOOD sign as we pass the blinking red beacon of the Capital Records building and drop into Franklin avenue and over the Architectural remnants of Hollywood's past whip up.  We are heading east at treetop level.  A warm glow in the distance quickly grows into a modest commercial strip which includes cafes, bookstores, and a theater. We drop to eye level as we spy through the plate glass showcase window of the "Bourgeois Pig" coffeehouse, which holds the translucent reflection of the full moon. A cigarette wedged between knuckles smoulders.  MIKE takes the last drag with great effort, then crushes it out.  He sits in the window sprawled across a red velvet couch that once perfectly complemented a faux spanish foyer.}
