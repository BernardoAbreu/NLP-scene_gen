<A>__{renai watches josh. he is completely still...in a trance. his eyelids flutter as his eyeballs probe in all directions underneath.}

<A>__{josh keeps moving, his fear registering, even in this world. he looks down at his feet. he is frustrated that he can't move any faster. he concentrates with fierce intensity and then watches as his feet touch the ground. he is walking. he starts to move faster, gaining control of his movement.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{dalton?}
<A>__{the sound of his voice is strangely dead as if he were inside a soundproof recording studio. there are no walls or angles for it to bounce off.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{dalton? where are you?}
<A>__{for a long time, there is nothing...}
<B>__{...}
<A>__{...then he sees it. a figure...shrouded in shadow. standing on the street corner with his back to josh. josh moves towards the figure. closer. closer. the man abruptly turns the corner without looking back. josh glances around the corner. there is nobody there. he continues down the street. he sees a little girl. far in the distance, but close enough to focus on. she stands and stares... ...then turns and walks away. gone...like an apparition. he looks to his right and sees a shadow. behind a curtain in one of the windows, back lit by candle light. as with the others, the shadow turns away and disappears. josh walks towards the front door of the house. he reaches it and turns the handle.}
