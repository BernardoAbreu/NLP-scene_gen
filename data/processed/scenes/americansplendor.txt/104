<L>__{interior tgif style restaurant 1980's night}
<A>__{the most awkward date in history. seated in an ultra yuppie restaurant filled with business lunchers, harvey and joyce hide behind their menus. while everyone else looks slick and successful, these two compete for the world's worst posture.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{somethin's wrong. yer lookin' around everywhere.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{i guess i never imagined you eating in a place like this.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{me? i never been here. i thought you'd like it. but obviously ya don't, do ya?}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{it's fine. what difference does it make?}
<A>__{harvey shakes his head, feeling more pessimistic.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{i dunno. none, i guess.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they sure got a lot of meat on this menu.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{you're a vegetarian?}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{kinda. i mean ever since i got a pet cat, i couldn't eat animals anymore.}
<A>__{joyce grabs a bread stick.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{hmm. i support and identify with groups like peta, but unfortunately i'm a self diagnosed anemic. also, i have all these food allergies to vegetables that give me serious intestinal distress. i guess i have a lot of borderline health disorders that limit me politically when it comes to eating.}
<A>__{harvey just stares at her.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{wow. yer a sick woman, huh?}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{not yet. but i expect to be. everyone in my family's got some kind of degenerative illness.}
<A>__{a cheery waitress bounces over.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(sing song)}
<D>__{good afternoon! i'm your server cindy! what can i bring you two today?}
<A>__{they slowly look up at her.}
