<L>__{exterior park morning}
<A>__{the neighborhood park. the trees in full bloom. maurice walks down a path leading to the open fields. only mothers with strollers and the elderly are out this early.}

<B>__{park bench}
<A>__{maurice is seated on a park bench. across from him is an elderly couple in their seventies. the old woman is frail with tiny eyes that disappear when she smiles. the husband is a skinny man with a baseball hat that makes him look like a little boy. maurice watches them silently as they sit and hold hands... their warm laughs and whispered conversations stinging him. he watches as the old man gets up. the old woman tries to make him stay, but he playfully pulls away. she shakes her head like a shy school girl as the old man walks back down the path by himself. the old woman glances maurice's way.}

<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i mean besides... time how did you know ten years ago twenty years ago?}
<A>__{she thinks hard... tough question. no answer for a moment then the old woman sees something out of the corner of her eye her husband is walking up the path with her white lace sweater over his arm... she smiles as the answer comes to her.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{because he shows me... he's not much for words, but he shows me.}
<A>__{maurice sits back her answer lingers in the air like a haunting voice. maurice watches as the old man comes back and drapes his wife with the sweater. the old woman waves as they continue down the path... hand in hand.}
