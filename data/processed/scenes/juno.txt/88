<L>__{interior loring house entry day}
<A>__{mark opens the door. juno stands there, looking radiantly knocked up. she holds a stack of cds. mark breaks into a grin.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{wow. that shirt is working hard.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(furtive)}
<D>__{is vanessa here?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{nope. we're safe.}
<A>__{he and juno smile conspiratorially.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{come on, i have something for you.}
<A>__{he gestures for juno to follow him into the house.}
<L>__{interior loring house basement afternoon}
<A>__{the lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and unattractive, much like paulie bleeker's. mark pulls a chain to illuminate a bare bulb.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{oh, mark! is this the baby's room? it's beautiful!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hilarious. no, i just keep all of my old comics down here, and i want to show you one of them.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{oh god, you're one of those guys...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you're gonna like this, i promise.}
<A>__{mark rummages through a cardboard box in the corner.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(extracting a bagged comic from the box)}
<D>__{here it is.}
<A>__{he shows the comic to juno. it's called "most fruitful yuki." it depicts a pregnant japanese girl kicking ass and taking names.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{"most fruitful yuki"? what is... oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{isn't that great? i got it when i was in japan with my band. she reminds me of you.}
<A>__{juno examines the comic. "most fruitful yuki" does resemble her.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{wow, i actually feel like less of a fat dork now.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{most fruitful yuki is bad ass, man. you should be proud to be the same condition.}
<A>__{she throws a karate kick in mark's direction with a kee ya! juno is sincerely pleased.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{okay, how about some tunes?}
<A>__{there's a battered portable cd player in the corner. juno kneels down and pops in one of the discs.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{now this first one is kinda slow. but it's mott the hoople so it's still totally rad and hardcore.}
<A>__{juno puts in the cd and "all the young dudes" fills the room. mark laughs.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i actually know this one.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. i danced to it at my senior prom.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{that's almost interesting, mark. who did you dance with?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{her name was cynthia vogel and she was a good dance partner. even let me put my hands on her butt.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{oh man, i can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!}
<A>__{she mockingly places her hands on mark's waist and moves back and forth stiffly.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no, i put my hands on your waist. then you put your arms around my neck. that's how we did it in '88.}
<A>__{mark puts his hands on what remains of juno's waist. she drapes her arms around his neck self consciously.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{oh, okay. like this.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you've never been to a dance, have you?}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(casually defensive)}
<D>__{only squares and nerds go to dances.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what are you?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{they sway slowly to the music. juno's belly bumps up against mark.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i feel like there's something between us.}
<A>__{they laugh. juno rests her head on mark's chest. they dance in silence for a few moments, then stop moving. mark pulls juno as close as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm leaving vanessa.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(quiet at first)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's just not working out, but i'm getting my own place in the city... and i've got it all planned out. it's something i've wanted to do for a long time...}
<A>__{juno backs away.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(growing)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{no. no, you definitely cannot do that, mark. that's a big, fat sack of no!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{this isn't what we agreed on. you guys have to take care of... this! you are the chosen custodians of the big ass bump!}
<A>__{she gestures wildly to her belly. suddenly, something matters to her far more than the approval of an older guy.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{but i thought you'd be cool if...}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i want you guys to adopt the buglet. i wanted everything to be perfect. not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. listen, once i have the baby, vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. believe me on this one!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{a baby is not going to fix everything. besides, i don't know if i'm ready to be a father.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(aghast)}
<D>__{but you're old!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i... how do you think of me, juno? why are you here?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i don't know. i just liked being your friend. i sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{this...}
<P>__{(he gestures to the}
<D>__{dank surrounding}
<P>__{room)}
<D>__{...this is what my life has become. stuff in boxes. stuff underground. is that so appealing to you?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeah, i guess... is this my fault? is vanessa mad at you because of me?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that's not the pointerior we're just not in love anymore.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeah, but didn't you love vanessa when you married her? if you love someone once, you can love them again, i know it. my friend leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. you're just not trying.}
<A>__{mark suddenly sees juno for what she is a teenage girl.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm such an idiot. i can't believe what an idiot i am.}
<A>__{he paces over to the wall and kicks it softly.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{please don't get a divorce! god, mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{god, you're so young.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{not really. i'm sixteen. i'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a holes!}
<A>__{juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at mark.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{oh and by the way, i bought another sonic youth album and it's the worst thing i've ever heard! it's just noise, man!}
<A>__{she bolts up the stairs, sobbing.}
