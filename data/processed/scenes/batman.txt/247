<L>__{interior stairway to belltower that moment night}
<A>__{batman. broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls himself up the steps one at a time. he should be dead. dried blood cakes his face, his chest. dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his utility belt for a painkiller and forces the capsule back onto his dry, swollen tongue. quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and topples over, landing with his full weight on the rotten wood of the belltower stairs. the stairway collapses, turning to splinters beneath him. and suddenly batman finds himself dangling precariously in midair, hanging by one hand to an upper step. it would be so much easier to let go. he looks down at the fragments of the shattered stairway, still falling, vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell. then he looks up. at the trapdoor. a mere six feet away. his teeth clench in a monstrous grimace. and with an inhuman effort, he hoists himself up onto the upper steps. for a full five seconds he's blind with pain. a ragged wooden shaft is buried in his right shoulder. twitching, trembling, he reaches up and yanks it out with his last ounce of strength. the trapdoor is a foot above his head. it could be a mile. batman finally realizes he's not going to make it. he reaches down and rips open a velcro seal on his utility belt, revealing the strange timer device we saw him making earlier. before he can activate it his hand falls limply at his side. the batman is out like a light.}
