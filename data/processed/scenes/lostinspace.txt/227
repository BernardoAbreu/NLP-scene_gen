<A>__{control console close. the core material in sinking fast. john moves towards it when something on the gantry catches his eye. gantry close. wedged into the grill work is a shiny scrap of metal reflecting the setting sunlight. john's father's dog tags. john rushes to the rail. there, still unconscious and hanging by the dog tag chain is older will. chain close. the metal links are pulling apart. will is seconds away from falling into the pool. john pov. the cylinder has completely sunken into the machine. it's will or the core material. no time for both. john stands a beat, immobile. then he drops to his knees, reaching down as the chain breaks, grabbing will's wrist at the last second. the dog tags tumble into the pool below as john hoists older will up onto the safety of the gangplank.}

<C>__{older will}
<D>__{look. they made it.}
<A>__{pan up. through a torn hole in the hull and a glowing rip in space, the jupiter two is rising into the flame ravaged sky.}
