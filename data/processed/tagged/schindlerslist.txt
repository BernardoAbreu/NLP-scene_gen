<C>__{by}
<D>__{steven zaillian final draft}
<T>__{in black and white:}
<A>__{train wheels grinding against track, slowing. folding table legs scissoring open. the lever of a train door being pulled. names on lists on clipboards held by clerks moving alongside the tracks.}
<C>__{clerks }
<D>__{...rossen... lieberman... wachsberg...}
<A>__{bewildered rural faces coming down off the passenger train. forms being set out on the folding tables. hands straightening pens and pencils and ink pads and stamps.}
<C>__{clerks }
<D>__{...when your name is called go over there... take this over to that table...}
<A>__{typewriter keys rapping a name onto a list. a face. keys typing another name. another face.}
<C>__{clerks }
<D>__{...youre in the wrong line, wait over there... you, come over here...}
<A>__{a man is taken from one long line and led to the back of another. a hand hammers a rubber stamp at a form. tight on a face. keys type another name. another face. another name.}
<C>__{clerks }
<D>__{...biberman... steinberg... chilowitz...}
<A>__{as a hand comes down stamping a gray stripe across a registration card, there is absolute silence... then music, the hungarian love song, "gloomy sunday," distant... and the stripe bleeds into color, into bright yellow ink.}
<L>__{interior hotel room cracow, poland night}
<A>__{the song plays from a radio on a rust stained sink. the light in the room is dismal, the furniture cheap. the curtains are faded, the wallpaper peeling... but the clothes laid out across the single bed are beautiful. the hands of a man button the shirt, belt the slacks. he slips into the double breasted jacket, knots the silk tie, folds a handkerchief and tucks it into the jacket pocket, all with great deliberation. a bureau. some currency, cigarettes, liquor, passport. and an elaborate gold on black enamel hakenkreuz (or swastika) which the gentleman pins to the lapel of his elegant dinner jacket. he steps back to consider his reflection in the mirror. he likes what he sees: oskar schindler salesman from zwittau looking almost reputable in his one nice suit. even in this awful room.}
<L>__{interior nightclub cracow, poland night}
<A>__{a spotlight slicing across a crowded smoke choked club to a small stage where a cabaret performer sings. its september, 1939. general sigmund list's armored divisions, driving north from the sudetenland, have taken cracow, and now, in this club, drinking, socializing, conducting business, is a strange clientele: ss officers and polish cops, gangsters and girls and entrepreneurs, thrown together by the circumstance of war. oskar schindler, drinking alone, slowly scans the room, the faces, stripping away all thats unimportant to him, settling only on details that are: the rank of this man, the higher rank of that one, money being slipped into a hand.}
<B>__{waiter sets down drinks}
<A>__{in front of the ss officer who took the money. a lieutenant, hes at a table with his girlfriend and a lower ranking officer.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{from the gentleman.}
<A>__{the waiter is gesturing to a table across the room where schindler, seemingly unaware of the ss men, drinks with the best looking woman in the place.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{do i know him?}
<A>__{his sergeant doesnt. his girlfriend doesn't.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{find out who he is.}
<A>__{the sergeant makes his way over to schindler's table. there's a handshake and introductions before and the lieutenant, watching, can't believe it his guy accepts the chair schindler's dragging over. the lieutenant waits, but his man doesn't come back; he's forgotten already he went there for a reason. finally, and it irritates the ss man, he has to get up and go over there.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{stay here.}
<A>__{his girlfriend watches him cross toward schindler's table. before he even arrives, schindler is up and berating him for leaving his date way over there across the room, waving at the girl to come join them, motioning to waiter to slide some tables together.}
<B>__{waiters arrive with plates of caviar}
<A>__{and another round of drinks. the lieutenant makes a halfhearted move for his wallet.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{let me get this one.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{no, put it away, put it away.}
<A>__{schindler's already got his money out. even as he's paying, his eyes are working the room, settling on a table where a girl is declining the advances of two more high ranking ss men.}
<B>__{a tablecloth billows}
<A>__{as a waiter lays it down on another table that's been added to the others. schindler seats the ss officers on either side of his own "date" }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{what are you drinking, gin?}
<A>__{he motions to a waiter to refill the men's drinks, and, returning to the head of the table(s), sweeps the room again with his eyes.}
<B>__{roar of laughter}
<A>__{erupts from schindler's party in the corner. nobody's having a better time than those people over there. his guests have swelled to ten or twelve ss men, polish cops, girls and he moves among them like the great entertainer he is, making sure everybody's got enough to eat and drink. here, closer, at this table across the room, an ss officer gestures to one of the ss men who an hour ago couldn't get the girl to sit at his table. the guy comes over.}
<C>__{ss officer 1}
<D>__{who is that?}
<C>__{ss officer 2}
<P>__{(like everyone knows)}
<D>__{that's oskar schindler. he's an old friend of... i don't know, somebody's.}
<B>__{girl with a big camera}
<A>__{screws in a flashbulb. she lifts the unwieldy thing to her face and focuses. as the bulb flashes, the noise of the club suddenly drops out, and the moment is caught in black and white: oskar schindler, surrounded by his many new friends, smiling urbanely.}
<L>__{exterior square cracow day}
<A>__{a photograph of a face on a work card, black and white. a typed name, black and white. a hand affixes a sticker to the card and it saturates with color, deep blue. people in long lines, waiting. others near idling trucks, waiting. others against sides of buildings, waiting. clerks with clipboards move through the crowds, calling out names.}
<C>__{clerks}
<D>__{groder... gemeinerowa... libeskind...}
<L>__{interior apartment building cracow day}
<A>__{the party pin in his lapel catches the light in the hallway.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{stern?}
<A>__{behind schindler, the door to another apartment closes softly. a radio, somewhere, is suddenly silenced.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{are you itzhak stern?}
<A>__{at the door of this apartment, a man with the face and manner of a talmudic scholar, finally nods in resignation, like his number has just come up.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{i am.}
<A>__{schindler offers a hand. confused, stern tentatively reaches for it, and finds his own grasped firmly.}
<L>__{interior stern's apartment day}
<A>__{settled into an overstuffed chair in a simple apartment, schindler pours a shot of cognac from a flask.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{there's a company you did the books for on lipowa street, made what, pots and pans?}
<A>__{stern stares at the cognac schindler's offering him. he doesn't know who this man is, or what he wants.}
<C>__{stern}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{by law, i have to tell you, sir, i'm a jew.}
<A>__{schindler looks puzzled, then shrugs, dismissing it.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{all right, you've done it good company, you think?}
<A>__{he keeps holding out the drink. stern declines it with a slow shake of his head.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{it did all right.}
<A>__{schindler nods, takes out a cigarette case.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i don't know anything about enamelware, do you?}
<A>__{he offers stern a cigarette. stern declines again.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{i was just the accountant.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think? change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?}
<A>__{schindler lowers his voice as if there could possibly be someone else listening in somewhere.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{field kits, mess kits...}
<A>__{he waits for a reaction, and misinterprets stern's silence for a lack of understanding.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{army contracts.}
<A>__{but stern does understand. he understands too well. schindler grins good naturedly.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. don't you think?}
<C>__{stern}
<P>__{(with an edge)}
<D>__{i think most people right now have other priorities.}
<A>__{schindler tries for a moment to imagine what they could possibly be. he can't.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{like what?}
<A>__{stern smiles despite himself. the man's manner is so simple, so in contrast to his own and the complexities of being a jew in occupied cracow in 1939. he really doesn't know. stern decides to end the conversation.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{get the contracts and i'm sure you'll do very well. in fact the worse things get the better you'll do. it was a "pleasure."}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{the contracts? that's the easy part. finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.}
<A>__{he laughs loudly, uproariously. but then, just as abruptly as the laugh erupted, he's dead serious, all kidding aside }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you know anybody?}
<A>__{stern stares at him curiously, sitting there taking another sip of his cognac, placid as a large dog.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{jews, yeah. investors.}
<C>__{stern}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{well, they wouldn't own it, i'd own it. i'd pay them back in product. they can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.}
<A>__{he shrugs; it sounds more than fair to him. but not to stern.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{pots and pans.}
<C>__{schindler}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{something they can hold in their hands.}
<A>__{stern studies him. this man is nothing more than a salesman with a salesman's pitch; just dressed better than most.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{i don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.}
<C>__{schindler}
<P>__{(a slow knowing nod)}
<D>__{they should be.}
<A>__{silence.}
<L>__{exterior cracow night}
<A>__{a mason trowels mortar onto a brick. as he taps it into a place and scrapes off the excess cement, the image drains of}
<B>__{color.}
<A>__{under lights, a crew of brick layers is erecting a ten foot wall where a street once ran unimpeded.}
<L>__{exterior street cracow day}
<A>__{a young man emerges from an alley pocketing his jewish armband. he crosses a street past german soldiers and trucks and climbs the steps of st. mary's cathedral.}
<L>__{interior st. mary's cathedral day}
<A>__{a dark and cavernous place. a priest performing mass to scattered parishioners. lots of empty pews. the young polish jew from the street, poldek pfefferberg, kneels, crosses himself, and slides in next to another young man, goldberg, going over notes scribbled on a little pad inside a missal. pfefferberg shows him a container of shoe polish he takes from his pocket. whispered, bored }
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{you don't recognize it? maybe that's because it's not what i asked for.}
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{you asked for shoe polish.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{my buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the army. but by the time it got there because of the cold it broke, the whole truckload.}
<C>__{goldberg}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so i'm responsible for the weather?}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{i asked for metal, you gave me glass.}
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{this is not my problem.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{look it up.}
<A>__{goldberg doesn't bother; he pockets his little notepad and intones a response to the priest's prayer, all but ignoring pfefferberg.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{this is not your problem? everybody wants to know who i got it from, and i'm going to tell them.}
<A>__{goldberg glances to pfefferberg for the first time, and, greatly put upon, takes out his little notepad again and makes a notation in it.}
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{metal.}
<A>__{he flips the pad closed, pockets it, crosses himself as he gets up, and leaves.}
<L>__{interior hotel day}
<A>__{pfefferberg at the front desk of a sleepy hotel with another black market middleman, the desk clerk. both are wearing their armbands. pfefferberg underlines figures on a little notepad of his own }
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{let's say this is what you give me. these are fees i have to pay some guys. this is my commission. this is what i bring you back in occupation currency.}
<A>__{the clerk, satisfied with the figures, is about to hand over to pfefferberg some outlawed polish notes from an envelope when schindler comes in from the street. the clerk puts the money away, gets schindler his room key, waits for him to leave so he can finish his business with pfefferberg... but schindler doesn't leave; he just keeps looking over at pfefferberg's shirt, at the cuffs, the collar.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{that's a nice shirt.}
<A>__{pfefferberg nods, yeah, thanks, and waits for schindler to leave; but he doesn't. nor does he appear to hear the short burst of muffled gunfire that erupts from somewhere up the street.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you don't know where i could find a shirt like that.}
<A>__{pfefferberg knows he should say 'no,' let that be the end of it. it's not wise doing business with a german who could have you arrested for no reason whatsoever. but there's something guileless about it.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{like this?}
<C>__{schindler}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{there's nothing in the stores.}
<A>__{the clerk tries to discourage pfefferberg from pursuing this transaction with just a look. pfefferberg ignores it.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{you have any idea what a shirt like this costs?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{nice things cost money.}
<A>__{the clerk tries to tell pfefferberg again with a look that this isn't smart.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i don't know, ten or twelve. that's a good color. dark blues, grays.}
<A>__{schindler takes out his money and begins peeling off bills, waiting for pfefferberg to nod when it's enough. he's being overcharged, and he knows it, but pfefferberg keeps pushing it, more. the look schindler gives him lets him know that he's trying to hustle a hustler, but that, in this instance at least, he'll let it go. he hands over the money and pfefferberg hands over his notepad.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{write down your measurements.}
<A>__{as he writes down the information, pfefferberg glances to the desk clerk and offers a shrug. as he writes }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i'm going to need some other things. as things come up.}
<L>__{exterior garden scherner's residence cracow day}
<A>__{as oberfuhrer scherner and his daughter, in a wedding gown, dance to the music of a quartet on a bandstand, the reception guests drink and eat at tables set up on an expansive lawn.}
<C>__{czurda}
<D>__{the ss doesn't own the trains, somebody's got to pay. whether it's a passenger car or a livestock car, it doesn't matter which, by the way, you have to see. you have to set aside an afternoon, go down to the station and see this.}
<A>__{other ss and army officers share the table with czurda. schindler, too, nice blue shirt, jacket, only he doesn't seem to be paying attention; rather his attention and affections are directed to the blonde next to him, ingrid.}
<C>__{czurda}
<D>__{so you got thousands of fares that have to be paid. since it's the ss that's reserved the trains, logically they should pay. but this is a lot of money.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{the jews. they're the ones riding the trains, they should pay. so you got jews paying their own fares to ride on cattle cars to god knows where. they pay the ss full fare, the ss turns around, pays the railroad a reduced excursion fare, and pockets the difference.}
<A>__{he shrugs, there you have it. brilliant. he glances off, sees something odd across the yard. two horses, saddled up, being led into the garden by a stable boy.}
<C>__{schindler}
<P>__{(to ingrid)}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{schindler gets up from the table. scherner, his wife and daughter and son in law stare at the horses; they're beautiful. schindler appears, takes the reins from the stable boy, hands one set to the bride and the other to the groom.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{there's nothing more sacred than marriage. no happier an occasion than one's wedding day. i wish you all the best.}
<A>__{scherner hails a photographer. as the guy comes over with his camera, so does just about everybody else. scherner insists schindler pose with the astonished bride and groom. big smiles. flash.}
<L>__{interior storefront cracow day}
<A>__{a neighborhood place. bread, pastries, couple of tables. at one sits owner and a well dressed man in his seventies, max redlicht.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{i go to the bank, i go in, they tell me my account's been placed in trust. in trust? what are they talking about, whose trust? the germans'. i look around. now i see that everybody's arguing, they can't get to their money either.}
<C>__{max redlicht}
<D>__{this is true?}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{i will take you there.}
<A>__{max looks at the man not without sympathy. he's never heard of such a thing. it's really a bad deal. but then }
<C>__{max redlicht}
<D>__{let me understand. the nazis have taken your money. so because they've done this to you, you expect me to go unpaid. that's what you're saying.}
<A>__{the owner of the place just stares at redlicht.}
<C>__{max redlicht}
<D>__{that makes sense to you?}
<A>__{the man doesn't answer. he watches max get up and cross to the front door where he says something to two of his guys and leaves. the guys come in and start carting out anything of any value: cash register, a chair, a loaf of bread...}
<L>__{exterior cracow street day}
<A>__{max strolls along the sidewalk, browsing in store windows. people inside and out nod hello, but they despise him, they fear him. just as he's passing a synagogue, some men in long overcoats cross the street. einsatzgruppen, they are an elite and wild bunch, one of six special chivalrous duty squads assigned to cracow.}
<L>__{interior starar boznica synagogue same time day}
<A>__{the sabbath prayers of a congregation of orthodox jews are interrupted by a commotion at the rear of the ancient temple. several non orthodox jews from the street, including max redlicht, are being herded inside by the einsatz boys. they're made to stand before the ark in two lines: orthodox and non. one of the einsatzgruppen squad removes the parchment torah scroll while another calmly addresses the assembly:}
<C>__{einsatz nco}
<D>__{i want you to spit on it. i want you to walk past, spit on it, and stand over there.}
<A>__{no one does anything for a moment. the liberals from the street seem to say with their eyes, come on, we're all too sophisticated for this; the others, with the beards and sidelocks, silently check with their rabbi. one by one then they file past and spit on the scroll. the last two, the rabbi and max redlicht hesitate. they exchange a glance. the rabbi finally does it; the gangster doesn't. after a long tense silence.}
<C>__{max redlicht}
<D>__{i haven't been to temple must be fifty years.}
<P>__{(to the rabbi)}
<D>__{nor have i been invited.}
<A>__{the einsatz nco glances from max to the rabbi and smiles to himself. this is unexpected, this rift.}
<C>__{max redlicht}
<P>__{(to the rabbi)}
<D>__{you don't approve of the way i make my living? i'm a bad man, i do bad things?}
<A>__{max admits it with a shrug.}
<C>__{max redlicht}
<D>__{i've done some things... but i won't do this.}
<A>__{silence. the einsatz nco glances away to the others, amused.}
<C>__{einsatz nco}
<D>__{what does this mean? of all of you, there's only one who has the guts to say no? one? and he doesn't even believe?}
<P>__{(no one, of course answer him)}
<D>__{i come in here, i ask you to do something no one should ever ask. and you do it?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what won't you do?}
<A>__{nobody answers. he turns to max.}
<C>__{einsatz nco}
<D>__{you, sir, i respect.}
<A>__{he pulls out a revolver and shoots the old gangster in the head. he's dead before he hits the floor.}
<C>__{einsatz nco}
<D>__{the rest of you... ...are beneath his contempt.}
<A>__{he turns and walks away. the other einsatz boys pull rifles and revolvers from their coats and open fire.}
<L>__{exterior cracow day}
<A>__{in black and white and absolute silence, a suitcase thrown from a second story window arcs slowly through the air. as it hits the pavement, spilling open sound on and, returning to color thousands of families pushing barrows through the streets of kazimierz, dragging mattresses over the bridge at podgorze, carrying kettles and fur coats and children on a mass forced exodus into the ghetto. crowds of poles line the sidewalks like spectators on a parade route. some wave. some take it more soberly, as if sensing they may be nexterior}

<D>__{goodbye, jews.}
<L>__{exterior ghetto gate day}
<A>__{the little folding tables have been dragged out and set up again, and at them sit the clerks. goldberg, of all people, has somehow managed to elevate himself to a station of some authority. armed with something more frightening than a gun a clipboard he abets the gestapo in their task of deciding who passes through the ghetto gate and who detours to the train station.}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{what's this?}
<A>__{pfefferberg, with his wife mila, at the head of a line that seems to stretch back forever, flicks at goldberg's od armband with disgust.}
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{ghetto police. i'm a policeman now, can you believe it?}
<C>__{pfefferberg}
<D>__{yeah, i can.}
<A>__{they consider each other for a long moment before pfefferberg leads his wife past goldberg and into the ghetto.}

<A>__{dismayed by each others' close proximity, orthodox and liberal jews wait to use the floor's single bathroom.}
<L>__{interior ghetto apartment night}
<A>__{from the next apartment comes the liturgical solo of a cantor. in this apartment, looking like they can't bear much more of it, sit some non orthodox businessmen, stern and schindler.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{for each thousand you invest, you take from the loading dock five hundred kilos of product a month to begin in july and to continue for one year after which time, we're even.}
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<D>__{that's it.}
<A>__{he lets them think about it, pours a shot of cognac from his flask, offers it to stern, who brought this group together and now sits at schindler's side. the accountant declines.}
<C>__{investor 1}
<D>__{not good enough.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{not good enough? look where you're living. look where you've been put. "not good enough."}
<P>__{(he almost laughs at the squalor)}
<D>__{a couple of months ago, you'd be right. not anymore.}
<C>__{investor 1}
<D>__{money's still money.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{no, it isn't, that's why we're here.}
<A>__{schindler lights a cigarette and waits for their answer. it doesn't come. just a silence. which irritates him.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{did i call this meeting? you told mr. stern you wanted to speak to me. i'm here. now you want to negotiate? the offer's withdrawn.}
<A>__{he caps his flask, pockets it, reaches for his top coat.}
<C>__{investor 2}
<D>__{how do we know you'll do what you say?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{because i said i would. what do you want, a contract? to be filed where?}
<P>__{(he slips into his coat)}
<D>__{i said what i will do, that's our contract.}
<A>__{the investors study him. this is not a manageable german. whether he's honest or not is impossible to say. their glances to stern don't help them; he doesn't know either. the silence in the room is filled by the muffled singing next door. one of the men eventually nods, he's in. then another. and another.}

<C>__{stern}
<D>__{the standard ss rate for jewish skilled labor is seven marks a day, five for unskilled and women. this is what you pay the economic office, the laborers themselves receive nothing. poles you pay wages. generally, they get a little more. are you listening?}
<A>__{schindler turns from the wall of glass to face his new accountant.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{what was that about the ss, the rate, the... ?}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{the jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the ss, not to the worker. he gets nothing.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{but it's less. it's less than what i would pay a pole. that's the point i'm trying to make. poles cost more.}
<A>__{stern hesitates, then nods. the look on schindler's face says, well, what's to debate, the answer's clear to any fool.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{why should i hire poles?}
