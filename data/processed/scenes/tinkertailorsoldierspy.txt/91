<A>__{smiley sits down and begins to read.}
<C>__{control }
<D>__{report by soviet high command on their recent naval exercises in the black sea. just what the admiralty have been begging us for some information on.}
<C>__{smiley}
<P>__{(engrossed)}
<D>__{where did you get it?}
<C>__{control}
<D>__{i didn't. percy and his little cabal walked in with it.}

<P>__{(protesting "cabal")}
<D>__{control...}
<C>__{control}
<D>__{shut up, esterhase.}
<A>__{control waves him down. smiley considers the report dispassionately.}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{if it's genuine it's gold dust.}
<P>__{(beat) but its topicality makes}
<D>__{it suspect.}
<A>__{control turns to alleline, with a mocking smile.}
<C>__{control}
<D>__{smiley is suspicious, percy. smells a fake.}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{where does it come from? what's the access?}
<C>__{control}
<D>__{percy doesn't feel like telling.}
<A>__{percy packs his pipe, enjoys the moment the young lion challenging the old.}
<C>__{percy alleline}
<D>__{a new secret source of mine.}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{but how could he possibly have access to...?}
<C>__{percy alleline}
<D>__{he has access to the most sensitive levels of policy making.}
<A>__{smiley stares at him, staggered. if it's true, this is the jackpot. alleline enjoys his amazement, he leans over points with bureaucratic pride to the flames on the letter}

<C>__{percy alleline }
<D>__{we have named the operation "witchcraft."}
<C>__{smiley}
<P>__{(faintly)}
<D>__{we?}
<C>__{control}
<D>__{percy and his pals have bypassed us, smiley. gone straight to the minister. everyone's very excited. percy's to be allowed to keep the identity of his new friend top secret.}
<C>__{percy alleline}
<D>__{the minister agrees with me that too many secrets are blown around here. too much failure, too many scandals, too little solid intelligence!}
<A>__{control is still smiling but only now do we realise he is almost shaking with fury.}
<C>__{control}
<D>__{luckily percy's cabal has come to save us.}
<C>__{percy alleline}
<P>__{(bulldozing on)}
<D>__{it's all office politics here.}
<C>__{roy bland}
<D>__{percy does have a point, control. we should be fighting communism, not each other.}

<C>__{roy bland}
<D>__{control, if we could all just...}
<C>__{control}
<D>__{out! all of you!}
<A>__{alleline, bland and esterhase leave. for a moment it looks as if haydon will stay, but then he stands up, shaking his head and saunters out.}
<C>__{smiley}
<P>__{(cautiously)}
<D>__{if witchcraft is genuine...}
