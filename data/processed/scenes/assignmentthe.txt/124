<A>__{ramirez comes out the door and starts toward the stairs. ramirez suddenly bangs into a dst agent. the two of them look at each other in shock for a beat. neither was expecting the other to be there. the moment seems to last forever. they are literally face to face. which one will react first? ramirez takes half a step back, raises his gun and fires, exploding the dst agent's forehead. ramirez has a moment of horror, splattered with the blood and brains of this man. we intercut a flash of the dst man being hit in an instant, almost subliminal replay as if ramirez's brain must register the scene twice to comprehend it. just then, a shot rings out from below and ramirez, who can't help staring in horror at the dead man, flees once more for his life.}
