<L>__{interior mccoy meatpacking plant day}
<A>__{we're in a noisy meat packing plant. workers in blood stained aprons slam cleavers into hunks of beef. ed walks down an aisle with donald e. mccoy, a wealthy texan meat man. old man mccoy is a tough talking, tobacco chewing, straight shooter.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...and then dr. vornoff falls in the pit, and his own octopus attacks and eats him! the end. old man mccoy whew! that's quite a story. so you made the movie, and now you want to make it again?}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(gently correcting him)}
<D>__{no. we shot ten minutes of the movie, and now we're looking for completion funds. old man mccoy son, you're too vague. i come from the world of business. i need to know what i get for my investment.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{movies are very popular. you could make a lot of money. old man mccoy yeah, but most of 'em flop, don't they? what am i tangibly guaranteed?}
<C>__{ed}

<A>__{mccoy spits his tobacco.}
<D>__{old man mccoy okay, two things. number one: i want the movie to end with a big explosion. sky full of smoke.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{but the story ends with dr. vornoff falling in the pit old man mccoy not anymore. and number two: i've got a son. he's a little slow but a good boy. and something tells me he'd make a hell of a leading man...}
<A>__{under ed's cheery frozen smile, his face clearly falls.}
