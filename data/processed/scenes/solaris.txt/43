<A>__{kelvin, on the edge of his bed. he wants to tear himself inside out. a voice calls over the intercom: snow's.}

<D>__{was her breakfast conversation that bad?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{i told you, try to stay calm. you're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{what was it?}
<A>__{kelvin rises and goes to wash his face.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{personally, i think it's god. at least, it fits my definition.}
<C>__{kelvin}

<D>__{it started with gibarian. he locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door. he covered the video lens. obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown. i don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there. by this time, we were getting visitors, too. he was desperately trying to figure it out. day and night.}

<D>__{who was she?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{my wife.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{dead?}
<A>__{kelvin nods.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{she has materialized from your memory of her. what was her name?}

<C>__{snow}
<D>__{it started about three months ago. right after the government sold the expedition. we were ready to go home.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{will she come back?}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{probably.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{i wish you'd told me.}

<C>__{snow}

<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{to who?}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{what are you going to report back to earth?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{an enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. we are in little danger of being left alone for long.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you'll need to do something. otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{gibarian said he thinks solaris should be destroyed.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{that's ludicrous. this is contact. we have found god. the only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on earth. so how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?}
