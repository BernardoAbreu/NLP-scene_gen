<CHAR>__{JIM'S FAMILY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<ACTION>__{JIM'S GRANDMA: A chic, domineering woman in her sixties who}
<DIAL>__{has made her son Frank dependent upon her for every breath he takes.  She is the irritant in the household--the silent ruler--the silent enemy of Frank's marriage.}
<ACTION>__{JIM'S FATHER: Frank is an unfeathered man who has never been}
<DIAL>__{able to have fun.  He is anxious to be a real father to Jim, but has never learned how.}
<ACTION>__{JIM'S MOTHER: Tense and immature, she has never found the}
<DIAL>__{husband she married.  Upset by the presence of her mother-in-law, mated with an ineffectual and joyless man, she takes out her disappointment on him and on her son.}
<ACTION>__{JIM: The angry victim and the result.  At seventeen he is}
<DIAL>__{filled with confusion about his role in life.  Because of his "nowhere" father, he does not know how to be a man.  Because of his wounding mother, he anticipates destruction in all women.  And yet he wants to find a girl who will be willing to receive his tenderness.}
<CHAR>__{JUDY'S FAMILY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<ACTION>__{JUDY'S FATHER: a junior partner in a law firm.  Boyish,}
<DIAL>__{attractive and debonair.  Because he is frightened by the adolescence of his daughter, Judy, his only recourse is to criticize her.}
<ACTION>__{JUDY'S MOTHER: Self-centered and frightened by the coming of}
<DIAL>__{middle-age.  She feels that Judy's blossoming youth is threatening her wifely position as the desirable object of the husband's attentions.}
<ACTION>__{JUDY: The victim and the result.  At sixteen, she is in a}
<DIAL>__{panic of frustration regarding her father--needing his love and suffering when it is denied.  This forces her to invite the attention of other men in order to punish him.}
<ACTION>__{BEAU: Judy's brother.  Because he is very young he is a}
<DIAL>__{danger to nobody and thus will grow up happily-- certain of the love of his father who feels comfortable in giving it.}
<ACTION>__{PLATO: Son of a divided family--an absent father and a}
<DIAL>__{traveling mother--he feels himself the target of desertion. At fifteen he wants to find a substitute family for himself so that he need no longer feel cold, and especially a friend who will supply the fatherly protection and warmth he needs and cannot find.}
<ACTION>__{BUZZ: A sado-masochistic boy of seventeen, who acts out}
<DIAL>__{aggressively his idea of what a man should be in order to hide his real sensitivities and needs.  He was probably rejected by both parents and must constantly court danger and must constantly court danger in order to achieve any sense of prestige or personal worth.}

<TRANS>__{FADE IN:}
<ACTION>__{A deep night sky.  Matte shot.  Camera searches slowly upward through the heavens and the silver tone of a bell is heard sounding the strokes of midnight. On the final note of the bell, camera is full on the Milky Way and there it rests, just long enough for a burst of Easter singing to arise.  The hymn is sung by the crude, unmatched voices of children.  Camera pans down to include: Spire of a church.  Camera continues its downward pan as the singing continues and we pass a window beyond which is the source of the singing.  Camera pans off window to show-- Long shot.  City.  Night.  Suddenly revealed--crisp and sparkling with lights.  Camera pans down and over: A lonely street full of parked cars.  The singing diminishes but a thread of it remains.  A car has just parked.  The headlights snap off.  A MAN emerges whistling the same melody and pulls some gifts from the front seat.  He slams the door and starts down the street in the direction of a house with bright windows.  He must pass an empty lot full of rusty grass and litter which lies in darkness between two street lights. As the MAN walks by the lot, still whistling, a GROUP OF FIGURES rises silently from the grass, figures who have been lying in concealment until now.  They step noiselessly onto the pavement and follow the MAN.  At the sound of their boots the whistling stops. The MAN glances behind him and sees the figures walking after him, filling the pavement.  A street light shows them to be boys and girls and all quite young.  The MAN moves on more swiftly and the sound of their pursuit increases.  He begins to run toward the lighted house and the following steps run too.  Suddenly he stops under the next street light and turns to face the figures.  They are upon him and around him quickly.  Nobody speaks for a moment, then one of the boys grins.  His name is BUZZ.  He is big and filled with an awareness of his own masculinity.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing)}
<DIAL>__{I'll light it for you, Dad.}
<ACTION>__{BUZZ ignites a match and holds it near the Man's face for a second, searching it.  Then he ignites the whole box under his nose.  The MAN shrieks, and his packages fall.  BUZZ slaps him sharply, his smile gone. The camera pans away as the figures enclose him, and holds on a small mechanical monkey which has dropped from its wrappings.  It begins to dance madly on the pavement, then runs down. The feet of the figures scatter past the unmoving monkey. Then camera rises to show that the man has disappeared. There is a moment of awful stillness, then we see a boy coming down the street alone.  He is quite drunk, and he slips once.  This is JIM, a good-looking kid of seventeen with a crew-cut and wearing a good suit.  The spilled packages on the pavement stop him.  He bends down to see what they are and picks up the mechanical monkey from the wreckage.  He smiles and winds it up.  He sets it on the sidewalk and sits down.  He watches it dance for a moment, happily.  A siren is heard distantly, growing louder.  JIM pays no attention to it as he winds the monkey again and releases it for its dance.

<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE TO:}
<ACTION>__{Close shot.  Throbbing light of police car.  Night.  The siren screaming wildly, then dying.  The sound of brakes. Camera moves to reveal the police car stopped at the entrance of a Precinct Station.  Two officers dismount, bearing between them the struggling JIM.  They bear him up the steps and in through the double doors. Inside precinct station. Reception area.  A large open space onto which several corridors converge.  In the middle is a Sergeant's desk, really a quadrangular counter in the center of which the SERGEANT stands.  There are a few glass-walked interviewing rooms which open off the area, and several benches lining the walls.  The scene is one of confusion, activity and waiting.  Phones ring.  The arrested pass in custody of officers.  Present among others at JIM's entrance are: JUDY, who is blonde and sixteen.  She sits on a crowded bench wearing an expression of downcast bitterness.  On a bench across the way from her are three remarkably dirty little Mexican children without shoes or socks.  The oldest is a BOY of four who is protecting his little SISTER who in turn mothers an infant crying on the bench beside her. Standing at a corner of the desk is a docile, undersized boy of fifteen named JOHN "PLATO" CRAWFORD.  He is shivering. With him is a large NEGRO WOMAN, his maid.  JIM comes through the doors and is led to the desk.  One of the officers presents a brief report to the SERGEANT, who examines it.}

<ACTION>__{The officer leads JIM to JUDY's bench and stands him against the wall beside it. JIM is frisked, a look of prayer on his upturned face.  The OFFICER finds the toy monkey in his pocket and would take it, but when JIM asks to keep it, the OFFICER hands it back and moves away.  Another officer enters and leads the prisoner who is sitting next to JUDY into another room.  JIM sits beside her.  He smiles at her but receives only a chilling look.  He winds the monkey up and sets it dancing on the floor, but she is not amused.  Camera pans to show others reacting to the monkey with pleasure.  We see PLATO look up and smile a little.  Camera stops on the MEXICAN CHILDREN who are smiling too.  A bald JUVENILE OFFICER named GENE, squats before them, smiling.}

Inside BUZZ's car. (Process).  BUZZ leans way forward now. He seems to rise in his seat.  His mouth opens and the comb falls out. Full shot spectators staring in disbelief.

JIM takes a candle from the candelabra and leads JUDY along the edge of the pool to the glass doors beyond.  Silence except for their footfalls on the flagstone.

PLATO lying as they left him, but his eyes are open and he is crying.  Camera booms up as PLATO throws off the blanket and looks after them.  Camera booms higher until he is revealed as a small and lonely figure sitting by himself.  The pool echoes his weeping.}
