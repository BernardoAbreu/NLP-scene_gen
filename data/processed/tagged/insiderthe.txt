<L>__{interior a jeep, lebanon day}
<A>__{and we're in a speeding soviet jeep... two men in front, shouldering assault rifles. hezbollah soldiers... and there are three men in the back. a middle aged man wearing a tired suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on. and on either side of him, two men, blindfolded. the man on one side is in his forties, hands pressed in the pockets of a well travelled black leather jacket... a stocky man, with the edge of a j.d. salinger character, he's seen everything at least once. but even he has lost some of his self confidence, here, turning his head, sensing the wind, a blast of arabic music that disappears behind him... he's lowell bergman. on the other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky man with a voltmeter around his neck, norman.}

<A>__{the jeep races up narrow winding streets of a lebanese village. it's shadowed by a jeep in front, and in back, each carrying personnel armed with ak's and a few rpg's... and in the third jeep are two blindfolded, not very threatening lebanese soldiers. and as the speeding convoy passes a captured israeli armored personnel carrier covered with arabic graffiti, looking down on them from huge murals are the stern visages of the ayatollah khomeini, and a hezbollah religious leader, the sheikh fadlallah... and, suddenly the convoy skids to a stop... and blindfolded lowell and norman are roughly taken out, and pushed, stumbling, through the cloud of dust without sight... the lanky cameraman is stopped, told to wait, while lowell is pushed past armed men guarding a small stone house, and inside...}

<A>__{a round faced man in his mid forties, with large framed glasses, black hair and a grey black beard, wearing a dullbend, a turban, sits informally at a kitchen table... it's the sheikh fadlallah whose face stares out at us from walls. a gunman cradling an ak 47 sits in an incongruous purple armchair in a corner. a torn poster of the seychelles is on one wall. another gunman stands by a window. lowell is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table...}
<C>__{the sheikh}
<D>__{coffee?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{yeah... thank you.}

<D>__{how have you liked your stay?}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(droll)}
<D>__{what i've seen ...i've liked.}
<A>__{the sheikh smiles. and the smile passes as quickly as it came. a steaming cup of coffee in a small arabic demitasse is put down.}
<C>__{the sheikh}
<D>__{please to explain, why i should agree to interview...with pro zionist american media?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{because i think hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. so you care about what you're thought of in america. and in america, at this moment in time, hezbollah does not have a face.}
<P>__{(confident)}
<D>__{that's why.}
<A>__{and we've first realized this man is not a hostage; he's come here voluntarily.}
<C>__{the sheikh}
<D>__{perhaps you prove}
<A>__{journalism objectivity}
<D>__{and i see the questions first. then i decide if i grant the interview.}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(blunt)}
<D>__{no. we don't do that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you've seen "60 minutes" and mike wallace. so you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. you also know we are the highest rated, most respected, tv magazine news show in america.}

<C>__{lowell }
<D>__{so. mr. wallace. should he get on a plane or not?}
<A>__{the sheikh thinks it over and then...}

<D>__{that's good. that works.}
<P>__{(after a beat)}

<D>__{hello, sheikh...?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{hello, sheikh...?}
<A>__{silence. he hesitates, starts to lift his blindfold... he lifts it. and he sees the sheikh, and his gunmen, are gone. the house empty. only his cameraman, the lanky man, left there, standing by the door still in his blindfold...}

<A>__{lowell nods and opens the curtains from this commanding height. baalbek and the beqa'a valley below gold domed mosques. a moment of triumph. he dials his cell phone...}

<A>__{ day we're in a science laboratory... out of focus lab technicians, in white lab coats, celebrating a heavyset black woman's birthday... half her presents are opened. balloons, incongruous, floating above the lab... and there's a sense that somebody is watching... and from the waist up, a disembodied figure comes into focus behind a glass partition, as if quarantined, isolated, an expressionless man in his late forties, watching them...}
<L>__{interior jeffrey wigand's office day}
<A>__{the office soundproofed, he watches the people laughing, their lips moving. his hair not yet settled on grey, his face is changing, always interesting. born in the bronx, educated in upstate new york, he retains little of the accent and much of the directness. he's jeffrey wigand. he turns to resume gathering things from his desk...some technical books, a medical text on asthma...putting them in his briefcase. and as he leaves the office, the silent party like a bizarre mime behind him...}
<L>__{interior lobby, brown & williamson building day}
<A>__{briefcase in hand, jeffrey appears from the elevator from above, from wide and in front, his eyes, frozen pools... and like a bad dream, a broad shouldered man, leaning against the wall near the reception island in a suit he's not comfortable in, wearing an earphone, saying something into a lapel microphone after jeffrey's passed.}
<L>__{interior wigand's car, lousiville day}
<A>__{light mottled through trees reflects off the car window... jeffrey's face goes in and out of the tunnel of light and shadow...down this tasteful, suburban louisville street of neat houses and manicured lawns... he pulls into driveway behind a 3 series bmw. it's a grey french provincial replica...}

<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{dutiful, she shuts off the tv, going upstairs.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{deborah? debbie?}
<A>__{he looks outside. a woman is sitting on the back porch drinking wine, reading a paperback book, drinking wine. there's something like a hockney painting about her against the manicured lawns. right now the woman comes in. she's pretty, tall, languid, reserved, somebody it would be nice to wear on your arm. liane wigand. she has an odd delay between a thought and her speech...}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{oh, i didn't know you were home... it's early... isn't it?}
<A>__{he doesn't say anything...}
<C>__{liane }
<D>__{gotta take debbie to ballet...}

<A>__{and a little girl, eight, sitting on the floor in a ballet leotard, her head back, wheezing, her neck muscles contracting and bulging, her face pale, lips white, and her eyes filled with fear as rapid, shallow breathing induces a sense of suffocation. deborah wigand is having a severe asthmatic attack...}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{sweetheart, c'mon. c'mon.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{she was playing with my pooh doll again...}
<A>__{jeffrey sits her on the side of her bed next to which is a nebulizer, an air compressor to deliver medication via a tube into a circular mouthpiece. the compressor whirs. deborah breathes in the medication. jeffrey brushes the hair back from her face and wipes perspiration from her forehead as...}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{slow down. slow down. slow down. breathe deep. breathe deep. slow down, honey. slow down. slow down.}
<A>__{liane rushes in with rolled up towels, kneels in front of deborah, smiling to mask anxiety, and goes into the bathroom with the towels and turns on full blast the bathtub's hot water. we don't know why yet... deborah's chest heaves. she's scared. jeffrey gets in front of her and talks to her to arrest her attention.}
<C>__{wigand }
<D>__{here we go. deep breaths, deep breaths.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{she was playing with the pooh doll.}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{pooh's dusty, sweetheart...he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? so what's what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. and when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. and, we give you medicine, and you get better. huh? okay? you're better already, aren't you?}
<A>__{and the medication's taking effect and she's calmer. liane, hands clutched in her lap, smiles at deborah. now she takes deborah's hand and exchanges a look with jeffrey. jeffrey's a good father, a natural caregiver.}

<D>__{thank you for having us...}
<A>__{reverse: norman's camera crew is setting up. mike wallace is there. a dangerous combination of intelligence, arrogance, and celebrity, there's a kinetic quality about him. wallace sits across from the sheikh on a dais of patterned linoleum in incongruous armchairs against a wallpaper mural of a french formal garden. a sound technician wires the sheikh and mike with microphones. norman says something to lowell and then goes out.}
