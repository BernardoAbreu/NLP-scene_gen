<A>__{starks goes in the kitchen as she comes out with their drinks. he hears her turn on the radio. she lands on an oldies station that's playing "girl of north country" by bob dylan.}
<L>__{interior kitchen, waitress' apartment, night}
<A>__{starks smiles a little, then realizes he remembers, and likes, the song. it's the first familiar thing for him in days. he walks out slowly to the living room, where the waitress sits on the couch, drinking. starks moves closer to the radio, leaning into it, listening and forgetting, for a short while only as long as a piece of song everything else.}
<C>__{bob dylan}
<D>__{if you go when the snow flakes storm when the rivers freeze and summer ends. please see she has a coat so warm to keep her from the howlin' winds...}
<A>__{starks listens close smiling a small, sad smile. over the harmonica, we pull back and see two very lonely people passing time together the way people sometimes need to be able to.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{this is a great song.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{you remember it? starks [nodding slowly] it's like i feel like...i know who i am. i just can't remember anything that made me this person.}
<A>__{when starks looks at her then, he's so close to a meltdown that it takes him a moment to fight his way out of it.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{but hey, who can forget those words? the man just wants simple and good things for his woman that she be warm and happy. how hard can that be to remember?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{may be easy to remember, but not easy to get. being warm, maybe but, look, you don't even have a coat and i still have to chop wood to make a fire. [beat] and, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.}
<A>__{the christmas lights flash drowsily to their own tempo.}
<D>__{waitress [re: the lights] why don't i try to get them to stop blinking?}
