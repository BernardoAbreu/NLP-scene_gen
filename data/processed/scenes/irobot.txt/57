<L>__{interior holding cell early morning}
<A>__{spooner enters. pulls out a chair and drags it far from the table. he's been jumped too many times by this machine. four mounted cameras whir to life. the robot. perfectly still.}
<C>__{spooner}
<P>__{(sitting)}
<D>__{identify.}
<A>__{the robot tilts its head with a muted whir. as if it doesn't understand him. spooner. disdainful.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you are an ns 2 nestor class robot. your primary function is to perform the tasks assigned to you. identify.}
<C>__{the robot}
<D>__{i am an ns 2 nestor class robot. my primary function }
<C>__{spooner}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{cancel. perform task.}
<A>__{spooner wings a file onto the table. it comes to a stop near the robot. the robot, lifts one of its hands. gently resting its metal fingers on top of the file. then opens it. a stack of pictures. hogenmiller's corpse.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{describe.}
<A>__{the robot's emotionless face studies the grim images.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you have over 10,000 words stored in your memory. one third of those are adjectives. describe.}
<A>__{nothing.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{why don't i take a crack? heinrich hogenmiller, your creator. with a bullet in his brain. a bullet you put there.}
<A>__{the robot. looks up at spooner.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{cold blooded murder is a pretty new trick for a robot, don't you think? answer.}
<A>__{the robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across the table. spooner. crosses his arms.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{maybe you're stonewalling me. maybe you're sitting there right now thinking, "this guy's a complete asshole." that it?}
<A>__{still nothing.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{come on. am i right?}
<C>__{the robot}
<D>__{yes. you are right. you are a complete asshole.}
<A>__{and for a moment, spooner is shocked. you can see it in his eyes. he sits back in his chair. forcing a tight smile.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{okay. i guess that's a start. now maybe you can tell me what you were doing hiding five feet away from hogenmiller's corpse?}
<C>__{the robot}
<D>__{i was frightened.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{frightened. why do you suppose dr. hogenmiller would create a robot that could simulate fear?}
<C>__{the robot}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{doesn't seem like a very useful thing for a robot to have.}
<C>__{the robot}
<D>__{i don't know why.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{i wouldn't want my toaster to be frightened. or my vacuum cleaner }
<A>__{suddenly the robot slams its metal hands down on the table.}
<C>__{the robot}
<D>__{i don't know!}
<A>__{spooner flinches. slightly.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{looks like you can simulate other emotional states. i think that one's called "anger." have you ever simulated anger before?}
<A>__{the robot doesn't respond.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{answer me, robot.}
<C>__{the robot}
<D>__{my name is sonny.}
<C>__{spooner}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{so we're naming you now.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{dr. hogenmiller would make me sleep.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you mean he'd turn you off.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{and you didn't like being turned off. so one day you decided to stop him.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you found his gun, pointed it at his head. and pulled the trigger.}
<A>__{sonny shakes his head. faster and faster. getting upset.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you put a bullet in the brain of the man who made you.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{no! i could never hurt anyone!}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{but you tried to hurt me. you took a shot at me.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{my aim is perfect. if i'd wanted to hit you, i would have.}
<A>__{spooner's expression hardens.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{why would the man who wrote the laws of robotics build a machine that violates them?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{the laws say i can protect my own existence.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{only if that protection doesn't harm a human being.}
<A>__{a short pause. sonny. tilts his head.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{that doesn't seem fair, does it?}
<A>__{spooner. stares at him. just as...the door swings open. bergin enters. sticks his head in.}
<C>__{lt. bergin}
<D>__{i need you outside.}
<A>__{spooner. not wanting to go. not wanting to stay. gets up...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{detective.}
<A>__{he stops. turns back to the robot. it looks up at him. for a moment so human...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i did not kill him.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you were the only one in the room. if you didn't, who did?}
<A>__{he turns and heads out the door.}
