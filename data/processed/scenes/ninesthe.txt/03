<A>__{gary drags a beaten weber kettle. one of its wheels is broken, scraping against the deck. wider, we see gary's house has an incredible view of the city. he couldn't fucking care less. he yanks the circular grill out of the weber and throws it down the canyon. he empties a garbage bag into the barbecue: mostly women's clothes, but also some stuffed animals and photos still in their frames. there's too much to fit, so he tries stomping it down with a flip flopped foot. he cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins drenching everything inside. he sprays until the container is wheezing air. he shakes it, making sure it's really empty. then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying. and spraying. we follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of gary and a blonde woman. her eyes are scratched out, making her unrecognizable. under the grill, lighter fluid is dripping in a stream, soaking into the wooden deck. finally satisfied, gary throws the lighter fluid aside. he takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his pocket.}
