<L>__{interior acheron cave night}
<A>__{it takes the full complement of soldiers to open the enormous doors. khalar singh rides in. moonlight from the huge eyes of the skull illuminate terrifying faces in the darkness. faces of demonic warrior statues. at their feet lie the decaying bones of human skeletons, too numerous to count.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{this is no empire, only a graveyard.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{you see only with your eyes.}
<A>__{khalar nods to his men. two guardsmen take their torches and light other torches set in the walls. it sets off a chain reaction. as far as the eye can see torches ignite revealing the true scope of this place. an enormous cave, the walls lined with monumental columns that frame countless bas relief carvings of demonic origin. and at the far of the cave, an altar sits beneath a raised throne, surrounded by a sacrificial pool. the pool is empty. khalar turns to his guards.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{close the gates and stay here. send my son to me when he arrives.}
<P>__{(motioning to two of them)}
<D>__{you two, come with me.}
<B>__{the altar}
<A>__{khalar dismounts at the sacrificial altar, carved of out of purple shaded rock. around its edges are deep channels, for the blood of its victims. and on its four corners shackles of bone.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{the acheronians had a wonderful sense of balance, don't you think? for one to ascend to royalty, another must fall.}
<A>__{with the flick of a wrist, khalar cuts tamara's bonds. tamara head butts him, struggling to escape, but khalar absorbs the blow effortlessly. he throws tamara upon the altar, his two guards shackling her in place.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{for a hundred generations the kings of acheron were crowned, and the queens were sacrificed.}
<A>__{khalar snaps his fingers and two guardsmen bring an ornately carved box made of bone, laying it before the altar. like a chinese puzzle box, khalar manipulates the carvings of skulls, sacrifices, and creatures until the box unlatches. and from the box he lifts two items. a crown of gold and a crown of iron. the crown of gold is magnificent, ornately detailed gold that glows in the firelight. but the crown of iron is terrifying. huge rough spikes extend from it in every direction. it looks more like a weapon than a crown.}
<C>__{khalar singh }
<D>__{what a day for you. this morning you were a handmaiden. tonight, you are a queen giving birth to an empire.}
