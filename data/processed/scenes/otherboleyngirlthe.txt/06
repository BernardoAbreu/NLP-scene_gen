<A>__{`thump', the doors open, and mary is carried into the king's apartments. henry fusses, brings water. opens windows.}
<C>__{enry}
<D>__{go! leave us! go!}
<A>__{sir thomas bows to the king, shoots mary meaningful look, `don't fail me', and retreats. henry closes the doors. he and mary are left alone. henry makes her comfortable.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{thank you, your grace.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{`henry', please. the first rule of this room, is to leave `your grace's' and `your majesty's' outside.}
<A>__{henry looks up..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{is there anything i can bring you?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{nothing to increase your comfort or well being?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you might ask your servants to bring me some water.}
<A>__{henry goes to get water himself..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{there. there are no servants.}
<A>__{mary's eyes widen. the king of england brings her a drink! mary takes a sip of her drink and watches as henry goes behind a screen and begins to remove his costume. his mask. mary notices a mirror, and watches in the reflection of the mirror how henry removes the costume and status of king and becomes a man. private. enry visibly unwinds, his facial muscles relax. he breathes out deeply. his face becomes softer. more gentle. then he puts on a comfortable robe, and emerges from behind the screen. henry goes over to a pile of cushions, and flops down and smiles at mary.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{so, this is it? this is where the king of england sleeps?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{and reads. and writes. and finds a few moments each day...}
<P>__{(gestures)}
<D>__{...for himself.}
<A>__{henry smiles at mary..}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{you look surprised?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i am. i suppose it's more..}
<A>__{mary looks at the bed, the books, the pages of writing on the desk..}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{..simple than i imagined.}
<C>__{enry}
<D>__{there's no need for show. i am only ever here alone.}

<A>__{mary smiles, admitting he's right.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i also sense...that you might relish an opportunity to be yourself, too.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yes.}

<P>__{(can't believe she's saying this)}
<D>__{..henry.}

<C>__{mary}
<D>__{now it's your turn.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{to say something, or do something you couldn't outside.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{there are many things i cannot admit to in public. sadness, for example. and loneliness.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{but when you are loved as much as you are? how can you be lonely?}

<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yes. i do now.}
<C>__{enry}
<D>__{married my brother's widow because my father ordered it. as a duty. to keep the alliance with spain. and she is a remarkable woman. and wife. henry looks at mary..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{but i never looked at her or longed for her the way i do you. henry reaches out. their hands meet..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{imagine how different it might have been. for both of us..had we been able to chose for ourselves.. henry leans forward and they kiss. gently at first. mary resisting. then harder.. sensing this, the king picks mary up and leads her to the canopied bed, and lays her down.. they begin to make love. as radical a contrast to the scene with william carey as it is possible to imagine.. mary's eyes open. she gasps. her hands grip the sheets.. interior palace daybreak henry and mary, entwined in one another's arms, as the sun rises... interior corridor outside henry's apartments day several hours later: william stafford is fast asleep in a window seat in the corridor outside. finally, the door opens. and mary emerges from the king's apartment.}

<D>__{well, we'd better not keep him waiting. stafford turns, leads the way. mary follows. interior norfolk's study court day the duke of norfolk's dogs are eating breakfast out of bowls by the fire. slurping hungrily. the entire family is gathered. sir thomas, lady elizabeth. also present is william carey.}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{well..? mary stares at her husband..}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{did he have you? mary's eyes burn..}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{more than once? mary stares daggers..}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{you'd better get used to talking about it. once you sleep with the king, it's not a private matter any more.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yes. more than once. william carey's face: a flicker of pain..}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{so he was satisfied?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i believe so, uncle.}
<C>__{b}
<C>__{g}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{ood. this is where our work begins. it's one thing to catch the king. quite another to keep him. norfolk turns to sir thomas, ignoring mary as though she were a piece of livestock..}
<C>__{norfolk}
<D>__{i want you to keep her spotless, hair washed every day. she must read all the latest books and be able to venture and defend an interesting opinion. she must know her music, must be energetic and entertaining in company and in bed. that's how he likes his women. and if ever she's in any doubt as to how to conduct herself, or what to do next she should simply watch the queen. that woman kept him from straying for eleven years. and the effort almost killed her. but sir thomas has not heard. he is distracted. he watches from a palace window as, in a stableyard down below.. george and francis weston return from riding together. the sound of laughter as they dismount, and hand their horses to the stable boys.. sir thomas watches as george and francis walk back to the palace together. there's something in their manner, the intimacy between them.. sir thomas's smile fades. interior palace day `slap', henry spreads out a huge architect's drawing of a magnificent ship on a table. he sits with sir thomas boleyn and the duke of norfolk.}

<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{majesty! i'm...i'm speechless..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{nonsense. she's an angel. it's the least she deserves. and if there's anything else i can do for you, my friend..as an expression of my gratitude..let me know.}
<A>__{sir thomas's tails off. thinking..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{as it happens..there is one thing.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{name it.}

<D>__{do you have anyone in mind?}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{there is one lady, sir..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{go on..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{who i fear is too high born for us. and following the unfortunate matter between anne and henry percy, i didn't want my children to overreach themselves again..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{overreach themselves?}
<A>__{henry can't help smiling..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{one is currently in the king's bed. if they are good enough for me, i suggest they're good enough for anyone else. so..}

<D>__{who is it?}
<A>__{over this: we hear george's distraught voice..}
<C>__{george }

<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{i thought you had ambitions for this family.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{and that you wish to make a contribution yourself. not just stand back and watch your sisters. george nods..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{then my advice would be to start behaving like a man. a real man. do i make myself clear? sir thomas walks out. george stares after him..}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{yes, sir. interior ball room parker family castle night musicians play. we're at george's wedding. attended by the king and queen, all the senior lords. it's a markedly grander and posher affair than mary's earlier wedding, a clear indication of the boleyns' new, elevated status.}
<A>__{a formation dance is in progress. at the centre of it: george dances with a radiant, triumphant jane parker. george's eyes meet those of francis weston across the room. by contrast: henry dances with mary. a couple with eyes on for each other. locked to one another. blissfully unaware of and uninterested in anyone else. silently counting the minutes before they can tear off one another's clothes..}
