<A>__{as melanie scans the horizon. there isn't a bird anywhere in sight. the day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in its silence. her gaze comes to rest on mitch and the thin column of smoke again. in the distance, mitch sees her and raises his arm in greeting. she waves back at him. he puts the rake down and begins walking toward the house. close shot melanie there is anticipation on her face now. she watches mitch coming toward her, her eyes glowing. full shot mitch closer to the house now. close shot melanie waiting, anticipating. med. shot mitch he stops, looks at her, and then turns toward the house. close shot melanie as first surprised, and then puzzled. the back screen door clatters shut off screen. a small hurt look crosses her face. full shot melanie as she turns away from the house and begins walking in the garden, sipping idly at her coffee. a screen door clatters again. she turns. mitch is coming out of the house, from the front door, wearing a different shirt, buttoning it as he walks to her. two shot melanie and mitch}

<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{it's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? it's so beautiful and still now.}
<P>__{(pause; then sagely)}

<P>__{(secretively)}
<D>__{it's an uprising.}

<D>__{of birds?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{certainly, of birds.}
<A>__{mitch grins.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{it all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. he went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{growing a beard...}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(delighted)}
<D>__{yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{so they united.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{not at first. oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{well, they'll go along with anything.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{sure. but eventually, even the more serious minded birds began to listen. "why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{hear!}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{why should we submit ourselves to their domination?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{hear, hear!}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{and all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. birds of the world, unite!}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{take wing!}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{you have nothing to lose but your feathers.}
<A>__{they both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then laugh again and finally are silent. the garden is deathly still.}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(attempting to be serious)}
<D>__{what it was, probably...}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{mmm?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{they're probably hungry, that's all. this was a bad summer. they eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{with my little sparrow leading team.}
<A>__{she laughs, and mitch joins her, but it is hollow this time. like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror story, they are becoming a little frightened.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{it's so damn quiet out there.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{it was like that yesterday.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{after the gulls attacked.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{i hadn't thought of that.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{and then the swifts came.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{it makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....}
