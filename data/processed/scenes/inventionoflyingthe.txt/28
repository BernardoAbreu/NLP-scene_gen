<L>__{interior bar afternoon}
<A>__{mark and his friend greg (40's), an even less attractive, less interesting and less intelligent version of mark, are bellied up the bar with half empty beers in front of them.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i will start looking for a job tomorrow.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{lately i don't like indian people.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i don't like white people even more though. i fucking hate white people. i fucking hate people.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hey, thanks for setting me up with your cousin by the way.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{third cousin. she's hot right?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{very.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{way out of your league. dunno why you bothered.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it felt nice to go out with someone that pretty. like for just one moment i experienced what it would be like to be the type of person someone like that would date. it felt good. doesn't matter anyway. i will always be just who i am right now: average looking, of average intelligence with an average personality. just a completely generic human being.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{your life is still better than mine.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{by a good margin.}
<A>__{a sad beat.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{lately i've been crying in my sleep and waking up in a pool of urine.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i really wish i had a better friend than you.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{so, what are you going to do now?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't know. guess i will start looking for another crappy job.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{doubt you'll find one. not much need for an out of work writer specializing in the black plague.}
<A>__{mark downs his last shot.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm going to go now. you're seriously depressing me. i really wish i was cool enough to have a better friend than you.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{i'm the best you're gonna get, man. call me later.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{mark gets up and drunkenly stumbles out of the bar.}
