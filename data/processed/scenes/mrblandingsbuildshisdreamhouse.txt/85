<L>__{interior the blandings' living room night}
<A>__{jim, muriel and simms are going over the preliminary plans. betsy and joan are present, betsy reading the lansdale blade and joan reading a science book.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{it's impossible. i don't see how we can cut another inch.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{honey, you heard simms. as the house stands now it's over fifteen thousand dollars!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{well, it just doesn't seem possible }
<P>__{(afterthought)}
<D>__{for a house with such small rooms.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(patiently)}
<D>__{mrs. blandings, i've already explained. it's not only the size of the rooms so much as it is the number. you see, our primary problem is one of cubage }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that's right, dear, cubage.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{oh }
<P>__{(sorry he got into it)}
<D>__{just a figure of speech.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{but what does it mean?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(a little irritably)}
<D>__{cubage. it's just the number of cubic feet that }
<P>__{(lost, lamely)}
<D>__{ go into a cubic foot. go on, simms.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(consulting plans)}
<D>__{now is it absolutely essential for each of your daughters to have her own room with two closets and a separate bath?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(a look at the girls; clearing his throat)}
<D>__{yes. you see, er, my daughters are, er, approaching womanhood, and, er }
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(brief look at the girls)}
<D>__{i hadn't realized they were approaching it quite so fast.}
<P>__{(to jim)}
<D>__{perhaps what you need is not so much a house as a series of little bungalows.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{hmmm.}
<P>__{(examining plans)}
<D>__{what about that silly flower sink? we could eliminate that.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{i beg your pardon.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{or that sewing room upstairs, that's certainly a waste.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{if we're going to eliminate anything, we'll lose that ridiculous play room in the basement with that great big poker table.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{honey, i've got to have some relaxation.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{we've got thirty one and a half acres. go out in the back and do a little gardening.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{sure, and get poison ivy!}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(with dogged patience)}
<D>__{if i may interrupt, i'd like to suggest that none of these are really major eliminations. now if we could do with one less bathroom on the second floor }
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{i'm sorry. we couldn't possibly.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{mrs. blandings, a simple bathroom, eight by ten by eight with grade a fixtures will cost around thirteen hundred dollars.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{i refuse to endanger the health of my children in a house with less than four bathrooms.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{for thirteen hundred dollars they can live in a house with three bathrooms and rough it!}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{look, perhaps the most practical thing would be }
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{oh, look, we're in the lansdale paper!}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"historical society blasts vandalism!"}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{muriel, simms explained to you. we've just got to cut, cut }
<P>__{(reacts)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"censure vote passed re destruction of famed hackett edifice."}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, isn't that just too bad! let me see that.}
<A>__{he takes the paper, scans it, suddenly bursts into laughter.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{what's so funny.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{prutty. mrs. bildad prutty. get a load of this!}
<P>__{(reads)}
<D>__{"the semi monthly meeting of the lansdale historical society was turned into an uproar last night when its president, mrs. bildad prutty" how do you like that, bildad prutty? "reported the total demolition by its new york buyer of the historic old hackett house."}

<D>__{bildad prutty! muriel, i've got to send this to the new yorker!}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(drily)}
<D>__{read on, father.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(scans paper)}
<D>__{"mrs. prutty," bildad, that is "reminded her audience that several years ago the society started to raise a fund to purchase and restore the old house to its original condition."}

<D>__{read on, father.}

<D>__{and what did we pay, father?}

<D>__{eleven five, with the commission.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{muriel, isn't it time for those children to be in bed?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{now girls, i don't want to tell you again.}
<A>__{the front doorbell rings.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{as the camera follows muriel to the door, we hear:}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{twenty six hundred dollars!}
<C>__{simms' voice}
<P>__{(comfortingly)}
<D>__{i wouldn't be too concerned about mrs. prutty and her committee. after all, it's your property and if you want to tear it down }
<A>__{muriel opens the door, admits an excited bill cole.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{why, bill!}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(briefly)}
<D>__{hello, muriel.}
<P>__{(he strides past her}
<D>__{waving a telegram;}
<P>__{to jim)}
<D>__{well, you've done it again'. once, just once, why don't you come to me and find out if it's all right, if it's legal, before you go barging off and run yourself smack into another jam!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what's eating you?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(ignoring him; to simms)}
<D>__{and i must say, simms, i hold you equally responsible!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{what? what happened?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i'm afraid i don't understand.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(to simms; indicating jim)}
<D>__{did you let this idiot tear down that house?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what if he did? what of it?}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{reconstruction was unsound and totally impractical.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i quite agree. but you're dealing with a man who doesn't think before he acts, who goes off half cocked!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what is it? what did i do?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(ignoring him; to simms)}
<D>__{you're an architect! you must have been aware of the legality involved.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what? what legality?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(to simms)}
<D>__{you knew there was a mortgage on that house.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i assumed as much.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what happened? what are you talking about?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(ignoring him; to simms)}
<D>__{and you know the requirements in regard to a mortgage where there's demolition intended!}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{certainly. but since you were his lawyer, i naturally assumed }
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{with a man like this you can't assume anything!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{just one minute! i am entitled to know what i did! this is america! a man's guilty until he's proven innocent }
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{it's the other way around, father.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you go to bed!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{girls!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{bill, i've had a very trying day. would you mind telling me in clear, concise english just what crime i've committed and why?!}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(with weary resignation)}
<D>__{in clear, concise english, you tore down a house on which another man holds a mortgage without first getting his written permission.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, i i did?!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{and in such case, the mortgagee can demand the full payment of said mortgage upon demand }
<P>__{(waves telegram)}
<D>__{and mr. ephemus hackett so demands! six thousand clams! and he wants them now!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(appalled)}
<D>__{now?!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you've got ten days.}
<A>__{jim gulps. pause.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{for six thousand dollars we could have had a solaxion house and a crane mobile home.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{muriel!}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(herding the kids toward the door)}
<D>__{girls, say your good nights and off to bed without another word.}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{good night, mr. simms. uncle bill.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(protesting)}
<D>__{miss stellwagon says the problems of the parents should be the problems of the children.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(shooing them out)}
<D>__{you keep that in mind, dear. it'll help prepare you for motherhood.}
<A>__{the children exit. an embarrassed pause.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{perhaps we'd better let the plans go for the time being and }
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{no, simms, i will work this out. you go ahead with your final plans and let's see some estimates.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{and we'll just forget about that extra bathroom.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(preparing to leave)}
<D>__{very well. you'll hear from me as soon as possible. good night.}
<A>__{good nights are exchanged. muriel takes simms out of scene toward the door. camera holds on bill and jim.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(defeated)}
<D>__{six thousand dollars!}
<A>__{bill looks at jim with compassion.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what'll you do for collateral on your building loan?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i don't know, turn in my insurance policies or something.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(coming into scene)}
<D>__{now, jim, you can't do that.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{what if something should happen? you can't leave the children unprotected.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(somewhat irritably)}
<D>__{i'm not dead yet! and if i die, there's plenty left to take care of them.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{not if you cash in your policies.}
<A>__{as jim reacts with painful resignation:}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm sure it won't be necessary. i will see the boys at the bank. maybe you can put up your insurance as collateral. if necessary, i will sign a personal note.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{thanks, bill.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(paternally)}
<D>__{and jim, do me a little favor. the next time you're going to do anything, or say anything, or buy anything, think it over very carefully, and when you're sure you're right forget the whole thing. good night, muriel.}
<A>__{he goes to muriel and kisses her on the cheek. jim sees it, is annoyed.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{good night, bill.}
<A>__{camera follows muriel and bill to the door. he exits. muriel comes back into the room.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{what a wonderful friend.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(darkly)}
<D>__{what's with this kissing all of a sudden?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{just because a man is helpful in a business way, it doesn't give him extra curricular privileges with my wife!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{that's a fine thing to say about a friend of fifteen years!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(testy)}
<D>__{well, i don't like it. every time he goes out of this house, he shakes my hand and he kisses you.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{would you prefer it the other way around?!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(irritably)}
<D>__{well, i don't like it, that's all! why is he always hanging around? why doesn't he ever get married or something?}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(assumed innocence)}
<D>__{because he can't find another girl as sweet and pretty and wholesome as i am.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well it it doesn't look right. there are limits to friendship and }
<A>__{muriel comes over, puts a sympathetic arm around him.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{darling, let's not be silly about this. it's not bill, it's the house you're upset about.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(sigh)}
<D>__{i suppose so.}
<A>__{they kiss.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{do you think it's worth all this?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{of course, darling. we're not just building a house it's a home. a home for ourselves and our children and maybe our children's children.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(whimsically)}
<D>__{it's getting awfully crowded with only three bathrooms.}
<A>__{they look at each other, smile and kiss intimately, as we}
