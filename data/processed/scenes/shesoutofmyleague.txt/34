<A>__{it's friday night and several college parties are raging in the complex. kirk leads molly up the stairs and down the balcony hall toward his door. they pass a few college students on the way; a couple making out, a guy vomiting in a bush. two apartment windows are covered with tapestries of bob marley and a giant pot leaf.}
