<T>__{then:}
<B>__{a sudden flash of light}
<A>__{lightning. no. lightning is not red. sabretooth looks around, puzzled, then down at logan's motionless body. then to his feet where a hole in the ice sprouts bubbling water. the wind blows so violently now that he nearly misses two figures standing only a few yards away mere silhouettes in the icy haze. a closer look tells us it is a man and a woman, they wear strange uniforms of form fitting material the man wears a reflective visor that hides his eyes. the womanis face is care revealing dark skin, penetrating eyes and unusual white hair. another flash one that seems to come from the manis visor itself. an intense beam of red light. sabretooth looks down and sees the ice at his feet has broken away. he plunges through the ice like a mark in a carnival dunking tank. his massive weight and hairy coat quickly suck him down. the two figures cyclops (scott summers) and storm (ororo munroe) obviously two of the children we saw earlier now grown move over the hole and calmly watch sabretooth gather himself and swim back to the surface. storm looks down at the hole, concentrating her intense gaze. the wind whips further and the water in the hole begins to freeze over.}
<B>__{under the ice}
<A>__{sabretooth wisely concedes. with one last look at the two mysterious figures now nearly obscured by the ice, he turns his body and swims away with the same agility he had on land.}
<B>__{above the ice the snow and wind are now violently raging}
<A>__{cyclops and storm walk over to logan and look down at him curiously. logan's p.o.v. they look at one another, wondering. above them, a black shape looms into frame, bringing with it the whining of jet engines. this is the x jet and it is like no other plane we have seen before. logan's eyes begin to close as they obscure the last of all perceptible detail.}
