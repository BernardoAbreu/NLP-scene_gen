<A>__{hana appears from the cemetery, dragging a metal crucifix. it's bigger than she is, and she drags it, as if approaching calvary. a man watcher her from a bicycle. he's approaching fifty, grizzled and attractive, and could be italian. his hands are bandaged. hana aims the cross at the soil, but is not quite bit or strong enough. the man, caravaggio, chooses this moment to introduce himself. he drops the bicycle on the ground with a clatter.}
