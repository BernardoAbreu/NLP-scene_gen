<L>__{exterior airport curb day}
<A>__{follow a pair of perfect female legs as the woman's heels click along the sidewalk, suitcase rolling behind. although we can't see the woman riding on these legs, we can see several men stare as she passes by on her way into...}
<L>__{interior airport ticketing}
<A>__{more stares from more men and even a few women as we follow the legs to the check in line. the legs glide to the front and stop to wait for the next available ticket agent. from the slightly upward angle, we see two young male ticket agents. (one on each side of the legs.) one is black and one white; each are dealing with customers. they simultaneously notice our woman. they suspiciously eye one another and the race is on. each agent begins typing furiously to expedite their current customer in the hope of waiting on her nexterior angle on the white agent as he waits on a yuppie couple.}
<C>__{white agent}
<P>__{(rushed)}
<D>__{okay, how many bags are you checking? any bags!?}
<C>__{yuppie man}
<D>__{is this one too big to carry on?}
<C>__{white agent}
<D>__{no. carry it on. good call.}
<C>__{yuppie woman}
<D>__{grant, you don't want to lug that thing all over the airport.}
<A>__{the agent leans back and issues a bothered sigh. he looks to his right to check the progress of the black agent, who is waiting on an old asian woman.}
<C>__{black agent}
<P>__{(rushed)}
<D>__{did you pack your bags yourself?}
<A>__{the asian woman obviously did not understand a word of the question but she smiles and nods along.}
<C>__{asian woman}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{black agent}
<D>__{has anyone unknown to you asked you to carry anything onto your flight?}
<A>__{more smiles and blank nods.}
<C>__{asian woman}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{black agent}
<D>__{i think you mean no.}
<C>__{white agent}
<D>__{you can't do that!}
<C>__{black agent}
<D>__{she doesn't know what the hell i'm talking about!}
<C>__{yuppie man}
<D>__{where exactly is gate f5?}
<C>__{white agent}
<D>__{just past f4. have a day now folks. let's hustle it up.}
<C>__{asian woman}
<D>__{sank you!}
<C>__{black agent}
<D>__{no sweat. keep it moving.}
<A>__{the asian woman is not going anywhere. the black agent leans into her face and barks once like a dog. her smile turns to fear as she backs away, ending the race in a dead tie.}
<C>__{both agents}
<D>__{next!}
<A>__{reverse to show the woman they were competing for. she is a classy, sophisticated, blonde around thirty. drop dead beautiful. she is startled by the sudden call from both men. she laughs off her little scare and then randomly chooses the black agent. he shoots a smug victory grin over to his co worker, who is being an overtly sore loser.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{hi, i'm booked on flight 94 to burbank. molly mccall.}
<C>__{black agent}
<P>__{(trying way too hard)}
<D>__{california. fantastic. so do you travel quite a bit?}
<A>__{the white agent moves to loiter around the black agent's station, just to get a better look at molly.}
<C>__{white agent}
<D>__{hey derek. you got the numbers on the (making it up as he goes) new, um, procedures for the, um, airport thing... regarding the, ah, planes?}
<P>__{(to molly) whassup?}
