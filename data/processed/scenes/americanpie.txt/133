<L>__{interior east great falls high classroom day}
<A>__{jim sits, waiting for class to start. miserable. some students are obviously talking about him in the background. others study and chat. next to jim is michelle the reject, band dork that we've seen earlier. she's got a flute case on her desk. she's blabbering to jim. the kind of blabbering where every other sentence sounds like a question, even though it isn't.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{and so, one time? i was at band camp? and we weren't supposed to have pillow fights? but we had a pillow fight! and it was so much fun!}
<A>__{jim couldn't care.}
<C>__{michelle }
<D>__{and one time, we all lost our music? and we were supposed to play this song? but we didn't know it. so we just made it up! and we kept playing and playing but the conductor didn't know what we were doing and it was so funny!}
<A>__{jim looks wistfully over at nadia's empty desk.}
<C>__{michelle }
<D>__{so you're pissed about something, huh? you know what i do when i'm angry? i just play some bach on my flute. it's so relaxing. i learned to do that at band camp.}
<A>__{jim perks up the slightest bit.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{hold on. you have no idea why i'm angry?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{is it because we have a test tomorrow? sometimes i get cranky when i know i have a big test to study for.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{yeah, that's pretty much it.}
