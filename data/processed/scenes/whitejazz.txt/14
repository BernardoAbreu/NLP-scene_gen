<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{pitch black. then a series of strobe flashbulbs: maybe flesh, maybe two bodies, maybe both hairy pale. then groaning, then flickering fluorescent lights make it all look jaundiced.}
<L>__{interior low rent fuck tel room same moment}
<A>__{lights now. diskant awake, trying to loosen his jaw.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{junior picked up this quiff jocking other fags in a men's room. but quiff was a law student who wanted his record kept clean.}
<A>__{quiff nervous but cooing, dick out, on diskant's thigh. junior just as nervous...reloading a camera.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{he should suck his dick. y'know? put the icing on it.}
<A>__{a baffled moment as the comment registers.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{tell me that wouldn't sell it...plus he's a communist.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{we're ruining his career, not his soul. reload the camera.}
<A>__{diskant finally speaks: marble mouthed. pushes quiff away:}
<C>__{morton diskant}
<D>__{off me!}
<A>__{don't waste a second: grab diskant by the hair, narrate his immediate future.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{drop out of the city council race or i send these pictures to the papers.}
<A>__{diskant rips his head free. rage. blood from his mouth. scanning the room, sizing up the situation, then:}
<C>__{morton diskant}
<D>__{i will fight you rotten }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ and maybe salvage something that's a close cousin to `respect.' but what about your wife and kid getting hold of those pictures?}
<A>__{wait for the big futile scream struggle. keep waiting. diskant just sits. no words. and now i wish he'd cry, throw punches, anything...but he doesn't. i turn to junior:}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{take the quiff home.}
<C>__{quiff}
<D>__{my name's franklin }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ of course it is.}
<A>__{junior pulls quiff out the door. by his hand. just pete, me, and diskant now. silent moments drag sour...}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{i need a nod from you morton, let's me know you get it }
<C>__{diskant}
<D>__{ don't say my name...}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{he gets it.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{someone from the times will call for a quote. whatever your reason for dropping out make it real.}
<A>__{as pete and i turn to leave:}
<C>__{diskant}
<P>__{(not looking at us)}
<D>__{you eventually lose the ability to reconcile the things you've done to people. that's hell.}
<A>__{a long moment on me and pete. blunted by what we just heard.}
