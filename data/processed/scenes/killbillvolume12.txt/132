<T>__{time cut:}
<L>__{exterior white lotus temple day}
<A>__{pai mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front of him. his right fist is cocked back by his breastplate, he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall. the bride stands behind him, watching. he lets out a scream, and puts his fist through the wall. he turns to the new student;}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{since your arm now belongs to me, i want it strong. can you do that?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i can, but not that close.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{then you can't do it.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i can put my hand through that at six inches.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{and you could shoot a man from a rooftop with a scope sight rifle, if you so desired, but this is not what i asked. what if your enemy is three inches in front of you, what do you do then? curl into a ball? or do you put your fist through him.}
<A>__{he hits the wall again leaving another hole.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{now begin.}
<A>__{the bride takes her place in front of the wall. she hits it. only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her scraped knuckles. then again. and again....}
