<L>__{interior the house chamber morning, several hours later}
<A>__{thaddeus stevens is at his desk. the house is in session, the floor full of congressmen caucusing and arguing. the balcony's packed. mary and keckley sit at the front, nicolay and hay behind them. the blairs are among other officials, rich people, foreign dignitaries. there's a sudden quiet, then murmuring. ashley, stevens and everyone on the floor look up, ellis, hollister, hutton and hawkins among these. in the balcony, twenty well to do black people, mostly men, are escorted by several senators, including sumner and wade, to a reserved section of the balcony. the black people glance at their surroundings but are rigidly composed. asa vintner litton sees them enter. he looks about, at the representatives caucusing, or staring up at the visitors. something powerful strikes him. in a voice coarse with emotion, he calls up to the black visitors:}
<C>__{asa vintner litton}
<D>__{we welcome you, ladies and gentlemen, first in the history of this people's chamber, to your house!}
<A>__{there's tense applause. some of the black guests bow; most aren't sure how to respond. yeaman watches this, deeply moved. bilbo catches hawkins's eye and waves. hawkins looks anxiously around, blushing. everyone is seated, and the place is packed. schuyler colfax is in his high seat atop the rostrum, the sergeant at arms to his right. colfax gavels the house into session. ashley is at the podium.}
<C>__{schuyler colfax}
<D>__{mr. ashley, the floor is yours.}
<C>__{james ashley}
<D>__{on the matter of the joint resolution before us, presenting a thirteenth amendment to our national constitution, which was passed last year by the senate, and which has been debated now by this estimable body for the past several weeks. today we will vote...}
<A>__{cheers, boos, applause.}
<C>__{james ashley }
<D>__{by mutual agreement we shall hear brief final statements }
<A>__{general cheering for this, laughing.}
<C>__{james ashley }
<D>__{ beginning with the honorable george pendleton of ohio.}
<A>__{applause, boos. pendleton, taking the podium, is handed several letters by wood. he holds them over his head. the chamber's quiet.}
<C>__{george pendleton}
<D>__{i've just received confirmation of what previously has been merely rumored! affidavits from loyal citizens recently returned from richmond. they testify that commissioners have indeed come north and ought to have arrived by now in washington city! bearing an offer of immediate cessation of our civil war!}
<A>__{the chamber explodes. through the ensuing ruckus:}
<C>__{fernando wood}
<P>__{(to ashley, fake shock:)}
<D>__{are there confederate commissioners in the capitol?}
<C>__{james ashley}
<D>__{i don't... i have no idea where they are or if they've arrived or }
<C>__{fernando wood}
<D>__{if they've arrived?!}
<C>__{george pendleton}
<D>__{i appeal to my fellow democrats, to all republican representatives who give a fig for peace! postpone this vote until we have answers from the president himself!}
<A>__{in the balcony, hay and nicolay exchange worried glances.}
<C>__{fernando wood}
<D>__{postpone the vote!}
<A>__{ashley turns to stevens: "do something!" as pendleton's democrats begin to chant "postpone the vote!" mary, worried, looks from mrs. keckley to preston blair, who is focused on the leader of the conservative republican representatives, aaron haddam (r, ky). haddam looks up at preston, awaiting instructions. democrats and republicans rush to the speaker to support or protest the motion. in the balcony, preston slowly stands, saddened and angry.}
<C>__{fernando wood }
<D>__{i have made a motion! does anyone here care to second }
<A>__{preston nods at haddam: "go ahead." haddam rises.}
<C>__{aaron haddam}
<P>__{(in a powerful voice:)}
<D>__{gentlemen. the conservative faction of border and western republicans cannot approve this amendment, about which we harbor grave doubts, if a peace offer is being held hostage to its success. joining with our democratic colleagues, i second the motion to postpone.}
<A>__{the debate swells again as, in the balcony, schell scribbles in a notebook while latham whispers furiously in his ear. latham rips the page out before schell's finished; bilbo snatches it from him.}
<C>__{robert latham}
<D>__{quick, man! quick!}
<A>__{bilbo pushes his way out of the balcony. nicolay, then hay, follow on his heels. mary sees this; she's concerned.}
