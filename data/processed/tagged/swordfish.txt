<D>__{take dog day afternoon for example. arguably pacino's greatest performance, excepting the godfather, part i, and scarface, of course. a masterpiece of directing, easily lumet's best. the acting, the script, cinematography, all top notch. but, they didn't push the envelope. what if in dog day, sonny really wanted to get away with it? what if, and here's where it gets tricky. what if they'd started killing hostages? no mercy, no quarter, meet our demands or the cute blonde in the bell bottoms gets one in the back of the head, bam, splatter. what? still no bus?}
<C>__{gabriel }
<D>__{how many innocent victims would they let get sprayed across the windows before the city reversed its policy on hostage situations? and this was 1976. no c.n.n., no c.n.b.c., no m.t.v. no internet. fast forward to the present, same situation. can you imagine the feeding frenzy of the modern media? in hours it would be the top story from boston to budapest. all caught in 150 millimeter zoom, computer enhanced, and color corrected. you would practically taste the brain matter. six hostages die. ten. twelve. twenty. thirty. relentless. one after another. all over a bus, a plane, and a couple of million dollars that were federally insured.}
