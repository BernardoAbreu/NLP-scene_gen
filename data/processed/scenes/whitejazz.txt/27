<A>__{stroll. sidelong stares on the periphery. muted whispers from desk cops. feature this rookie chump clear a path as i pass. down a flight of stairs to the evidence lockers. junior writes seizure abstracts, sealing materials in green banded evidence bags. a pile stacked neatly on the table next to him. that red steno pad in full view.}
