<L>__{interior ridgedale mall day}
<A>__{juno and leah are walking through the mall, looking bored. juno is wearing one of mac's giant hockey jerseys in lieu of actual maternity wear. leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{yum. this pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{share the love, tits!}
<A>__{she wrestles leah for the pretzel. onlookers stare at them, appalled, as leah puts juno in a half nelson.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(to eavesdroppers)}
<D>__{she's assaulting me! she's denying me fresh baked goodness!}
<A>__{leah claps a hand over juno's mouth.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{hly shht!}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{juno drags leah behind a pillar and peers out from behind it. they're watching a group of well heeled women and their children shopping en masse. one of the women is pushing a toddler in an ultramodern stroller. and one of the women is vanessa, looking vaguely detached.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{that's her. that's vanessa loring.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{of the penny saver lorings?}
<A>__{juno nods.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{no way! she's pretty.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{you sound shocked or something.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{i just thought she'd look really old in real life.}
<A>__{the women gather near a play area, sip frapps and loudly discuss their outfits for an upcoming party.}
<D>__{woman #1 and i was like, "no offense, sweetie, but nobody looks good in gauchos." woman #2 especially not with her build.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(mimicking the women, peanuts style)}
<D>__{wah wah waaah!}
<A>__{one of the little girls in the group tugs at vanessa's sleeve. vanessa happily follows the little girl over to their play area and begins to play energetically with her. juno watches intently, but leah just snickers.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{she's gonna steal that kid for her collection.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{right, seriously.}
<A>__{they watch vanessa for a few more moments. the other kids wander over toward the play area while their mothers ignore them. vanessa continues to entertain the children.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{bo ring!}
<A>__{leah stands up. juno lingers for a moment.}
