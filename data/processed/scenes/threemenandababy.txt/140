<L>__{interior apartment morning}
<A>__{the doorbell rings. a bare chested michael, in jeans, drags himself over to the front door and opens it. there stands sylvia with mary in her stroller. sylvia is a disheveled mess.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{is jack here? 'cause i'm a mess. i can't handle it, i'm all alone...}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(shouting towards jack's room)}
<D>__{jack! jack, c'mere for chrissake!}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{'cause my place is tiny, y'know, and my schedule's insane and i just finished four days of posing and we ended up every day at...}
<A>__{jack, bare chested, comes in pulling on his jeans. he stops short at the front door. sylvia is about to cry.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{yeah, y'see, jack, i just did four days of posing...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{and every day we finished at three in the morning and since mary always gets up around 5:30...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{well, you can imagine how much sleep i've gotten...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah, of course, 'cause after the 5:30 bottle it starts all over again around nine...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{and by the time i change her and play with her a little, it's already eight o'clock...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and then that's it you get only an hour of sleep.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{and the babysitters till three a.m. all my money is sucked down the tubes!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{plus they don't put the kids to bed, they let them lie around half naked...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{oh, so the flowers and the rabbit were from you...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i could have strangled that guy...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{i mean it, i can't cope anymore. my parents and i don't talk to each other and anyway they live in texas, and the baby needs to get out to the park...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah, tell me about it! finding time to take her to the park every day is a real bitch!}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{and i have to work, i need the money to survive and anyway i love my job...}
<A>__{a distraught peter, bare chested and in jeans, comes running in from his room.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{but to work i've gotta have a babysitter, and to have a babysitter i need to work, so i run around all day...}
<P>__{(she sobs)}
<D>__{... and i'm not sure i'm taking good care of her...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{of course you're taking good care of her we know what it's like, don't cry, she looks great...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{it's just 'cause i haven't slept in four nights she must be teething or something, i don't know but i can't manage...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{don't worry, it's nothing, she's cutting a tooth you just have to put some stuff on her gums...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she pulled the same thing on us. we lost all our friends in one night on account of one tooth!}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{and just look at my face! nobody's going to want me to model for them with the way my face looks... and what'll happen to me if they don't want me anymore?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{but you're beautiful at your age all you need is a good night's sleep and you'll look like new.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{right, a good night's sleep but when?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, why don't you leave the baby with us for a few days, till you recuperate... i mean, if you want.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{we're old pros it's not a big deal for us...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(blowing her nose, wiping her eyes)}
<D>__{really? i can leave her with you for a little while?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{of course. leave her with us. come back whenever you want. get some rest.}
<A>__{sylvia, between two sobs, picks up a big bag beside her on the doorstep.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{i brought a couple of things for her, just for a few days...}
<A>__{michael eagerly takes the bag from her. it's followed by a second, and then a third.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(taking mary in his arms)}
<D>__{is she hungry?}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{yeah, it's time for her bottle it's all ready in the bag...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will go heat up some water right away. would you like a cup of coffee?}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{oh, okay, thanks...}
<A>__{peter, carrying mary towards the kitchen, is followed by jack and michael with the bags. sylvia blows her nose and walks around aimlessly in the hall. in the kitchen the three men bustle about with the bags, the bottle, the saucepan... they've swallowed all their pride and are kissing mary all over, on her neck, her hands, her tummy. they're deliriously happy. michael takes some sheets out of the bag.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i will go make up her bed!}
<A>__{he exits, and, once in the corridor, prances around, leaping and dancing... he gets to the living room and goes over to the crib: suddenly, he recoils and freezes, a fearful expression on his face. then he turns and races back to the kitchen.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(floored)}
<D>__{hey, you guys come and see, come and see!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{come see, i said.}
<A>__{jack and peter nervously follow michael into the living room. they stop short in front of the crib: there is sylvia, curled up in a fetal position, sucking her thumb and sleeping like an angel.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the poor thing, she's really wiped out.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she'll need two or three months to recover, at least... maybe more!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we could set up a room for her here...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{a room for her and a room for mary...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{then we could have four shifts instead of three!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah, but i don't think she'll agree. she's got her own life to live.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah, she probably wouldn't want to move here. she'd think we'd jump on her any chance we could...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{but we'd make a rule, she'd just be 'one of the guys!'}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she'll never want to...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(very awake)}
<D>__{so, i will take the ten a.m. to three p.m. shift... and i will take every other night... plus the walk in the park in the afternoon before i go to work... and we split the rent equally... and i will just be 'one of the guys'... deal? peter, michael, and jack}
<P>__{(smiling broadly)}
<D>__{deal.}
<A>__{mary suddenly comes in from the kitchen, walking unstead ily but determinedly. she's dragging graton's rabbit by its ear. she looks at the four of them and laughs her head off.}
<B>__{freeze frame.}
<D>__{end!}
