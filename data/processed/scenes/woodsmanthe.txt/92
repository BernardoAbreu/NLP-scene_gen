<L>__{interior bus night}
<A>__{the bus drives by a number of billboards, children's gap ads...}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{maybe it's like rosen said. maybe i wanted nothing to happen.}
<L>__{interior walter's apt. night}
<A>__{walter pauses in the writing.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(out loud)}
<D>__{fucking rosen! this isn't helping.}
<A>__{there's a loud knock at the door. walter looks over in surprise. the knock comes again. walter quickly closes his journal and puts it in a drawer. the knock comes again. walter goes to the door and opens it partially. sergeant lucas stands outside.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{hiya, walter.}
<A>__{walter opens the door. lucas enters. walter slowly closes the door behind him.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what can i do for you, sergeant lucas?}
<A>__{lucas signals a chair.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{have a seat.}
<A>__{walter slowly sits. lucas walks around the room. he pauses.}
<C>__{lucas }
<D>__{too much sun.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{lucas points to the plant on the windowsill.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{your ivy. too much direct sunlight. these plants don't like a lot of sun.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{they grow outside, don't they?}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{sure they do. but outside they've got trees around them. the trees shade them from the sun. of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. one of nature's symbiotic relationships.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you going to take me on a nature walk?}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{don't be witty.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. why did you stay on the bus, walter?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i fell asleep.}
<A>__{lucas throws him a look.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{when i woke up i was confused. i got off at the wrong stop and walked home.}
<A>__{lucas looks at the bus map on the wall.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{you walked home.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{lucas spits his gum into the garbage can and sits down across from walter.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{some of these guys... they walk right into a family's home as if they live there. very fucking ballsy.}
<A>__{walter is silent.}
<C>__{lucas }
<D>__{this one guy on death row, who i will call henry, told me about his last victim. henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven year old cutie named adele. her mother's in the living room watching tv. she's got the volume on so damn high he can hear david letterman's jokes. henry puts his hand over adele's mouth and says, "if you scream, little girl, i will kill your mother." and of course little adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.}
<P>__{pause)}
<D>__{ten days later they find adele's body. or what's left of it.}
<P>__{(looks at walter)}
<D>__{you believe in fairy tales?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{fairy tales?}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{do you believe in them?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{neither do i.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what's the one with the woodsman?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{woodsman?}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{the one with the ax?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{sure you do. he cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{little red riding hood.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{that's it. little red riding hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{ever see a seven year old girl sodomized almost in half?}
<A>__{walter shakes his head.}
<C>__{lucas }
<D>__{she looked so small and broken. i saw hardened twenty year veterans cry. they cried like babies. i was there. ain't no fucking woodsman in this world.}
<A>__{lucas takes out a fresh piece of gum and pops it in his mouth. then he rises.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you knew her?}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{the girl.}
<A>__{lucas stares coldly at walter, his face red. he looks dangerous.}
<C>__{lucas}
<P>__{(seething)}
<D>__{i don't know why they keep letting scum like you return to the streets. it just means we've got to catch you all over again.}
<A>__{he slaps walter on the back of the head...}
<C>__{lucas }
<D>__{see ya, walter.}
<A>__{... and exits. walter rushes to the blinds, drawing them down, then scrambles to get his journal from the drawer. he drops to his knees, tearing the pages from his journal, tearing them to bits.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you have no right to talk to... to speak like... i am not!... i am not!}
<A>__{the sound of children fades in, and walter looks up. in the bedroom doorway is the girl in her white nightgown, sitting on the red ball, rocking back and forth, her chin in her hands.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{wallie, what are you doing?}
<A>__{walter squeezes his eyes shut and clamps his hands over his ears. the sound abruptly stops.}
