<A>__{po lands hard on the floor. he tries to clear his head and wake up.}
<C>__{po's dad }
<D>__{po! get up!}
<A>__{we see his room is filled with various kung fu posters (including a poster featuring all of the five) and souvenirs, and a wooden version of the sword of heroes (the green sword). po sighs. he attempts to kick himself to his feet but alas, his belly is too worthy a foe.}
<D>__{po's dad (o.s.) (cont'd) po! what are you doing up there?}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{uh, nothing!}
<A>__{po hops to his feet, imitating his kung fu action figures.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{monkey! mantis! crane! viper! tigress! rowrrrr...}
<A>__{outside on the balcony of the neighboring house, a pig watering flowers stares at po. po tries to play it cool and then quickly ducks out of sight.}
<C>__{po's dad }
<D>__{po! let's go! you're late for work!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{coming!}
<A>__{he takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the wall. it bounces off. he throws the star again, but it bounces off again. he picks it up and heads downstairs. he trips and falls the rest of the way.}
