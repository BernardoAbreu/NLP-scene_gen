<L>__{interior ward 3, alpine grove, 1992, day}
<A>__{starks is in a different ward with patients who appear more threatening and disturbed. as he is anxiously looking around presumably for a way out starks hears one of the patients humming an eerily discordant melody. looking to see who it comes from, starks happens to spot one patient a young, fierce looking guy eyeing a young nurse, sally, administering medication from a dated cart. starks looks around the room and notes there are no doctors or orderlies around. the young nurse, meanwhile, is focused on the medicine oblivious to the brute eyeing her. the brute's not that far away when he starts walking towards the young nurse. starks starts in their direction, picking up speed maneuvering through various incoherent patients as the brute reaches the nurse. he throws her tray down and pushes her against the wall. she starts screaming as he pushes up against her. starks picks up the tray and strikes the brute across the head with it. the brute holds his head in pain as he tries to regain his balance. it's clear he's impaired. but it's also clear he understands pain.}
<D>__{starks [to sally] you ok?}
<A>__{as she nods, her eyes dart above to the hand about to strike him. off her look, he ducks and turns around, punching the brute in the stomach hard but not before the piece of glass he held from one of the broken medicine bottles comes perilously close to starks' head. the brute bowls over and starks looks at the glass terrified. is this when he dies? the brute incensed more than ever lunges at him a final time. starks gets him by the neck, expertly applying pressure points and, after only a few seconds, subdues him. starks himself seems surprised that he knew how to use them. he lets out a suspended breath, instinctively touching his forehead to make sure he's not cut. he looks back at sally.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{are you ok?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{yeah, why are you in this ward alone? where is everyone? sally [defensively] there's a state rep visiting so they've moved everyone around. but i've been alone before...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{where are the other orderlies?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{in the therapy session downstairs. that's what the rep's sitting in on...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{ok, listen. i want you to get out of here and lock the door behind you. i will go get some doctors.}
<A>__{sally looks at starks, wondering whether she can trust him. her eyes shift to the brute on the floor and she remembers that she can.}
