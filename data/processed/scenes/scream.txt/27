<L>__{interior living room later}
<A>__{the clock on the end table reads 7:15 pm. sidney is fast asleep on the couch. the phone rings. sidney leaps up grabbing the portable phone.}
<C>__{tatum}
<P>__{(from phone)}
<D>__{practice ran late. i'm on my way.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(eyes clock)}
<D>__{it's past seven.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{don't worry. casey and steve didn't bite it til way after ten.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i'm not worried.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{good, 'cause i wanna swing by blockbuster and get us a video. i was thinkin' tom cruise in all the right moves. you know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{whatever. just hurry.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{she hangs up the phone. it immediately rings again.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{tatum?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<P>__{(from phone)}
<D>__{hello, sidney.}
<A>__{it's him. the voice from before.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{hi. who is this?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you tell me.}
<A>__{sidney thinks, trying to place his voice. it sounds a little distorted.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{scary night, isn't it? with the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{aha, randy, you gave yourself away. are you calling from work? tatum's on her way over.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{do you like scary movies, sidney?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i like that thing you're doing with your voice, randy. it's sexy.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{what's your favorite scary movie?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{don't start. you know i don't watch that shit.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{and why is that?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(playing along)}
<D>__{because they're all the same. it's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can't act who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. they're ridiculous.}
<A>__{a brief silence.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{are you alone in the house?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{that is so unoriginal. you disappoint me, randy.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{maybe that's because i'm not randy.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{so who are you?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{the question is not who am i. the question is where am i?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{so where are you?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{your front porch.}
<A>__{this gives her pause. she moves to the window and pulls aside the drapes.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{why would you call me from my front porch?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{that's the original part.}
<A>__{angle through window. she can't quite see all of the porch.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{oh yeah? well i call your bluff.}
<A>__{sidney goes to the front door. she unlocks the bolt, unsnags the chain, and pulls the door open...revealing the front porch...}
<B>__{completely empty.}
<A>__{she steps out onto it, phone still in hand. a single light shines overhead illuminating the porch, but little beyond. darkness is all around.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{so where are you?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{right here.}
<A>__{sidney peers out into the darkness past thick shrubs that grow on either side of the porch.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{can you see me right now?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what am i doing?}
<A>__{she sticks her finger up her nose, pretending to pick. silence. no answer.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{good try, randy. tell tatum to hurry. bye now.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{if you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.}
<A>__{sidney stops dead in her tracks, speechless.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(deadly)}
<D>__{do you want to die, sidney? your mother didn't.}
<A>__{his seriousness unnerves her. sid flies off the handle.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{fuck you! you cretin!}
<A>__{she hangs up on him. moves back inside the house. locks, chains, and bolts the door when...}
<B>__{a figure comes leaping out of the hall closet}
<A>__{rushing her, ramming into her side..the phone flies..the figure is on top of her as she goes down...screaming... she looks up to see the figure, darkly dressed with a pale, distorted face, white and ghostly...a mask. her instincts surface and she kicks up with her foot making the contact with his leg...he topples over...coming right at her, his hand finding her neck. suddenly, along, silver blade appears above her. sidney pulls, jerks, twists...finally she lifts her torso forward knocking the figure off her...sending him reeling into the living room. wasting no time, sidney leaps to her feet. she moves to the front door, unlocks it...pulls it open...it catches on the chain. shit! she pushes it closed again looking behind her..the figure has risen, knife in hand. sidney pulls on the chain and then inexplicably turns and... runs up the stairs. the figure right behind her.}
