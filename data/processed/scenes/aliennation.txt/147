<L>__{exterior west side street night}
<A>__{sykes peels around the merging traffic, cuts across the intersection, and continues the chase. on the wrong side of the road, head on into traffic. headlights peel off in front of them as they charge along the wrong side. they eventually catch up to the police unit, racing parallel to it, but with the divider between them. sykes keeps one hand on the wheel and draws the casull with the other. he brings it up and around right in front of jetson's nose, pointing it through the passenger window at kipling. at that moment, kipling glances over and reacts to the bore of this huge gun staring him in the kisser. jetson reacts to the gun in his face... then reacts to something else he sees beyond it.}

<P>__{(sykes doesn't respond)}
<D>__{green light!}
<A>__{now sykes looks. the light at the intersection has just turned green and the rows of the cars that were waiting start coming. it's a wall of headlights coming right for the slug mobile.}
