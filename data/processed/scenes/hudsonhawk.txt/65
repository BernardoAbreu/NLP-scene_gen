<A>__{anna pets the head of hawk on her lap. she is pondering.}
<L>__{interior a mysterious dark room night}
<A>__{a sparse circle of light houses a chair and a pacing kaplan. snickers and butterfinger flop hawk onto the lit chair. kit kat is dressed exactly like anna. she reacts as she comes into the light. kaplan takes the codex from her.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{way to go, anna.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{when the mayflowers find out we have the codex, they're going to want to make a deal...}
<C>__{kaplan}
<P>__{(gung ho lying)}
<D>__{and then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... is that it?}
<A>__{hawk stirs. the viewer gets his woozy p.o.v.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{actually george, it's not it. what are we doing in this castle? i happen to know the mayflowers bought this castle last year when they found out da vinci used to do...}
<A>__{the lights in the room come on to the sound of holy da vinci theme, revealing an almost perfect refurbishing of the exact same workshop da vinci toiled in in the opening.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<P>__{(trying to be solemn)}
<D>__{it's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over. operation deflower mayflower is going full speed ahead.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(taking it in)}
<D>__{oh lord.... the only reason i ask is that hudson, uh, mr. hawk, hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about darwin, minerva, and you. basically that you're part of the same car pool.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{anna. anna. anna. if that were true, almond joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the codex. now, get some sleep. kit kat...}
<A>__{kit kat in drag spookily moves inches away from anna.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{cat got his tongue?}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{actually he never told us what it was.}
<A>__{kit kat smiles, revealing the fact he has no tongue.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{how sweet. i trust you will see hudson hawk is given to the proper authorities. i recommend leniency...}
<C>__{snickers}
<P>__{(holding in a laugh)}
<D>__{oh, i think we all do.}
<A>__{hawk gives her a look of honesty and pain that causes anna to guiltily gulp as she heads out with the mimicking kit kat.}
<C>__{snickers}
<D>__{do you think she has any idea that operation deflower mayflower is as bogus as kit kat's tits?}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{i don't think so, although bringing her to the castle gave her a big, juicy hinterior}
<C>__{almond joy}
<D>__{with all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't i cut out her heart?}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious vatican organization. hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....}
