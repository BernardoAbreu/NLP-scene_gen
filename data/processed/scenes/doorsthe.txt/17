<A>__{camera moving to reveal john densmore wiry, solid on the drums... moving on to robbie krieger, wispy, ethereal looking, the youngest, flamenco type moves on his early electric guitar. also a harmonica player and a base. they all seem slightly embarrassed by either the cheap sound system feedback or ray's warbling, but the crowd couldn't care less a german beerhall, they want noise and sex. jim and his gang, beers in hand, mouth back the words, beers everywhere shoved to the smokey ceiling, everyone on their feet, nuts with spring fever. jim eyeing the girl next to him.}
