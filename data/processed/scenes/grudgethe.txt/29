<A>__{karen walks to the front door, reaching out to unlock it but she pauses, realizing something. she reaches into her pocket, pulling out the photo she found. it only takes a second to verify the boy in the photo is the one she found in the closet. karen lowers the photo, bewildered. then she looks up, startled by the boy. he's kneeling on the second floor landing above, watching her through the bars of the metal railing. creepy. karen takes a step forward, forcing a smile.}
