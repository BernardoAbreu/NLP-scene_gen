<L>__{35. interior jessica's chamber castle caladan night}
<A>__{jessica and the reverend mother enter. it is quite dark. jessica whispers a code number and a glowglobe lights on a very dim setting. }
<C>__{reverend mother}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{jessica... you were told to bear only daughters to the atreides... jessica!}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{it meant so much to him...}
<C>__{reverend mother}
<D>__{you thought only of a duke's desire for a son?... desires don't figure in this! an atreides daughter could have been wed to a harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. we may lose both blood lines now.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{i vowed never to regret my decision. i will pay for my own mistakes.}
<C>__{reverend mother}
<D>__{and your son will pay with you.}
