<L>__{interior hospital morgue night}
<A>__{the dead of night, not a mouse in the house. curtis and karen, each garbed in a mask, stand on either side of quinn's body, which now rests on the autopsy table. quinn's body a preliminary exploratory y incision has been made across the chest, stretching from shoulder to shoulder, then continuing on down the abdomen. ribs and cartilage have been cut open to expose the heart and lungs.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you haven't started in on the internal organs?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.}
<A>__{curtis pauses, studying quinn's disfigured face the features seem much less damaged now almost as if the corpse were healing itself.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{that's weird }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{he looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up }
<A>__{curtis pulls out a penlight, flicks it on. he leans over quinn, shining the light into one of his eyes.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(grudgingly)}
<D>__{sometimes }
<A>__{curtis looks up from the corpse, grinning beneath his mask.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{ but then i remember what an ass hole you were and i'm snapped back to reality.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{jesus, karen, you're breaking my heart here }
<A>__{quinn suddenly bolts up from the autopsy table, sinking his fangs into curtis' jugular. he snaps the man's neck in two for easier access, sucking in blood like a living vacuum. karen stumbles backwards, sending autopsy tools clattering.}
<B>__{quinn}
<A>__{rises from the table, flinging curtis' twitching body aside. he curls his blood soaked lips back, baring viper like fangs, emitting a guttural growl }
<C>__{quinn}
<P>__{(crazed by thirst)}
<D>__{ more blood }
<A>__{karen backs into the corpse drawers, but quinn is upon her in a half second, wrapping a hand about her throat. his mouth opens morphs disturbingly wide as if to swallow her head whole, caustic saliva dripping from his canines karen tries to turn her head away, but quinn's grip is vise like. she finds herself staring into his eyes pupils pulsing rapid fire, opening and closing, hypnotic as quinn sinks the tips of his fangs into karen's carotid artery and starts to nurse bang!!! a load of mahogany buckshot chews into quinn's side. he howls in pain. another load catches him full in the face. he drops karen. she falls to the floor karen's pov the sound of rushing blood pounding through her skull. everything spinning. she struggles to move, turns her head, finds herself eye to eye with curtis' corpse.}
<B>__{on quinn}
<A>__{rising, his face torn up, smoking. whip pan to blade, standing at the entrance to the morgue, a streetsweeper auto shotgun in hand, sizing quinn up.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{now don't we look dapper?}
<A>__{quinn bellows with rage, ripping one of the heavy steel refrigeration doors from its hinges, flinging it at blade like it was lawn furniture blade rolls to the side as the door crashes against the wall. quinn runs, moving through the morgue like a human tornado, heading for the windows at the end of the room smash!!! out goes quinn, taking half the wall with him. blade rushes to the decimated window, looks down blade's pov quinn lands on the roof of an ambulance parked four stories below, caving it in. he springs off, loping across the tarmac on three limbs, then screech! thwump! rolling up onto the hood of an oncoming car, before disappearing into the night back up above, blade spins, sees karen bleeding her life away on the floor. she reaches a hand out to him, beseeching blade pulls away from her grasp, takes a step towards the exit then hesitates. a flicker of doubt washes across blade's face. he looks down at karen once more, wrestling with his conscience, finally making a decision. he kneels, scoops karen up into his arms. just then,}
<B>__{two policemen}
<A>__{rush into the morgue, weapons drawn }
<D>__{uniform #1 hold it, ass hole!}
<A>__{blade ignores them, turning to face the window before him. it's a good thirty feet to the roof of the adjacent building, a parking structure and damned if blade doesn't seem to be considering the jump. the police close in, agitated. blade crouches, switches karen to a one handed grip }
<D>__{uniform #1 i said hold it!!!}
<A>__{ and jumps.}
