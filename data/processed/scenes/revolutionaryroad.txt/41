<L>__{interior frank and april's bedroom night.}
<A>__{frank steps out of the bathroom. april turns from the mirror wearing the silk negligee and comes towards him with two glasses.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{frank. i have had the most wonderful idea. i've been thinking about it all day.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what's all this about?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{you know how much money we have saved...?}
<A>__{she hands frank a glass of brandy.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{enough to live on for six months without you earning another dime. and with the money we could get from the house and the car, longer than that.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what we get for the house...what are you talking about? where are we going to live?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{...paris.}
<A>__{frank stares.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{you always said it was the only place you'd ever been that was worth living. so why don't we go there?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're serious?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{yes. what's stopping us?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what's stopping us? well, i can think of a lot of things. for instance, what kind of a job could i possibly get?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{you won't be getting any kind of job, because i will.}
<A>__{frank laughs.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh, right.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{don't laugh listen a minute! have you any idea what they pay for secretarial positions in the government agencies in europe? embassies and those things.}
<A>__{frank laughs again.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, i don't.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i'm serious about this frank. do you think i'm kidding or something?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, i know, i know. i just have a couple of questions, is all. for one thing, do you mind telling me what exactly i'm supposed to be doing while you're out earning all this money?}
<A>__{she draws back, shocked that he doesn't get it.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{don't you see that's the whole idea? you'll be doing what you should've been allowed to do seven years ago. you'll have time, frank. you'll have time to find out what it is that you actually want to do, and when you figure it out you'll have the time and the freedom to start doing it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sweetheart, it's just not very realistic, is all.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{well, i happen to think this is unrealistic. i think it's unrealistic for a man with a fine mind to go on working like a dog year after year at a job he can't stand, coming home to a place he can't stand, to a wife who's equally unable to stand the same things.}
<A>__{frank is silent. how could anyone possibly argue with her?}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{you want to know the worst part? our whole existence here is based on this great premise that we're somehow very special and superior to the whole thing, and you know what i've realized...? we're not! we're just like everyone else. look at us! we've bought into the same ridiculous delusion. this idea that you have to resign from life and settle down the moment you have children. and we've been punishing each other for it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{listen: we decided to move out here. no one ever forced me to take the job at knox.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{i mean who ever said i was supposed to be a big deal, anyway?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{when i first met you, there was nothing in the world you couldn't do or be.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i was a little wise guy with a big mouth, that's all.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{you were not! how can you even say that?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{...all right... so, i will have time. and god knows that's appealing. it's very appealing. and i mean, everything you say might make a certain amount of sense, if i had some definite talent maybe. if i were an artist or a writer.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{but frank, listen to me: it's what you are that's being stifled here. it's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{and what's that?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{don't you know...?}
<A>__{he looks at her. she gazes back at him.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{you're the most valuable and wonderful thing in the world... you're a man.}
<A>__{frank looks at her. in that moment, he loves her more than ever before. he kisses her.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{this is our chance, frank. this is our one chance.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{okay?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{why not...? why the hell not?}
<A>__{april throws her arms around him.}
