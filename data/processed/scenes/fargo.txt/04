<L>__{interior car}
<A>__{carl drives. grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window. from the back seat we hear whimpering. grimsrud turns to look. jean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a tarpaulin.}
<C>__{grimsrud}
<D>__{shut the fuck up or i will throw you back in the trunk, you know.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{geez. that's more'n i've heard you say all week.}
<A>__{grimsrud stares at him, then turns back to the window. at a loud whoop carl starts and looks back out the rear window. fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on his gumballs. carl eases the car onto the shoulder.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{ah, shit, the tags...}
<A>__{grimsrud looks at him.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{... it's just the tags. i never put my tags on the car. don't worry, i will take care of this.}
<A>__{he looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on the gravel shoulder.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{... let's keep still back there, lady, or we're gonna have to, ya know, to shoot ya.}
<A>__{grimsrud stares at carl.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{... hey! i will take care of this!}
<A>__{both cars have stopped. carl looks up at the rear view mirror. the trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them, writing in his citation book. carl watches. we hear the trooper's door open. the trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly on top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night air. carl opens his window as the trooper draws up.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{how can i help you, officer?}
<A>__{the trooper scans the inside of the car, taking his time. grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window. finally:}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{this is a new car, then, sir?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{it certainly is, officer. still got that smell!}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{you're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{certainly }
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{can i see your license and registration please?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{certainly.}
<A>__{he reaches for his wallet.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{... i was gonna tape up the temporary tag, ya know, to be in full compliance, but it, uh, it, uh ... must a slipped my mind...}
<A>__{he extends his wallet toward the trooper, a folded fifty dollar bill protruding from it.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{... so maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in brainerd.}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{what's this, sir?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{that's my license and regis tration. i wanna be in compliance.}
<A>__{he forces a laugh.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{... i was just thinking i could take care of it right here. in brainerd.}
<A>__{the policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the billfold and hands the billfold back into the car.}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{put that back in your pocket, please.}
<A>__{carl's nervous smile fades.}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{... and step out of the car, please, sir.}
<A>__{grimsrud, smiling thinly, shakes his head. there is a whimpering sound. the policeman hesitates. another sound. the policeman leans forward into the car, listening. grimsrud reaches across carl, grabs the trooper by the hair and slams his head down onto the car door. the policeman grunts, digs awkwardly for footing outside and throws an arm for balance against the outside of the car. with his free hand, grimsrud pops the glove compartment. he brings a gun out and reaches across carl and shoots bang into the back of the trooper's head. jean screams.}
<C>__{grimsrud}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{he releases the policeman. the policeman's head slides out the window and his body flops back onto the street. carl looks out at the cop in the road.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{whoa... whoa, daddy.}
<A>__{grimsrud takes the trooper's hat off of carl's lap and sails it out the open window.}
<C>__{grimsrud}
<D>__{you'll take care of it. boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{whoa, daddy.}
<A>__{jean, for some reason, screams again. then stops.}
<C>__{grimsrud}
<D>__{clear him off the road.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he gets out.}
