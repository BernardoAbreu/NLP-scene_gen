<L>__{interior cloud city large cell}
<A>__{chewie now has a little more of threepio back together. one arm is connected, but the legs are yet to be attached. there is one small problem, however. it seems the wookiee has managed to put the droid's head on backwards.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{oh, yes, that's very good. i like that. oh! something's not right because now i can't see. wait. wait! oh, my! what have you done? i'm backwards, you stupid furball. only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...}
<A>__{threepio is cut off in mid sentence as chewie angrily deactivates a circuit and the droid shuts down. the wookiee smells something and sits up. the door to the chamber slides open and a ragged han solo is shoved into the room by two stormtroopers. barking his concern, the huge wookiee gives han a big hug. han is very pale, with dark circles under his eyes.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i feel terrible.}
<A>__{chewie helps han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open revealing leia. she, too, looks a little worse for wear. the troopers push her into the cell, and the door slides closed. she moves to han, who is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking his head.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{why are they doing this?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{they never even asked me any questions.}
<A>__{the cell door slides open. lando and two of his guards enter.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{lando.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{get out of here, lando!}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{shut up and listen! vader has agreed to turn leia and chewie over to me.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{over to you?}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{they'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{what about han?}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{vader wants us all dead.}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{he doesn't want you at all. he's after somebody called skywalker.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{luke?}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{lord vader has set a trap for him.}
<A>__{leia's mind is racing.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{and we're the bait.}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{well, he's on his way.}
<A>__{han's rage peaks.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{perfect. you fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?}
<P>__{(spits it out)}
<D>__{my friend!}
<A>__{han hauls off and punches lando. the two friends are instantly engaged in a frantic close quarters fight. the guards hit han with their rifle butts and he flies across the room. chewie growls and starts for the guards. they point their laser weapons at the giant wookiee, but lando stops them.}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{stop! i've done all i can. i'm sorry i couldn't do better, but i have my own problems.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{yeah, you're a real hero.}
<A>__{lando and the guards leave. han wipes the blood from his chin as leia and chewie help him up.}
<C>__{leia}
<P>__{(dabs at his wound)}
<D>__{you certainly have a way with people.}
