<T>__{entangled:}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{ and this, and this, and they'll coil back rather violently, which i'm afraid will only wound the poor fellow further.}
<A>__{the geordie nods.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{you speak good english.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i speak english well.}
<P>__{(re: the cutters)}
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{the geordie hands them over and peter surveys the wires.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{what if we cut his head free first? so he won't try to stand up and blind himself? and then }
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{pity you didn't bring a second pair. then i could cut the wire here }
<A>__{he points to one of the wires entangled with the strand he'd been prepared to cut. peter stands and shouts in the direction of his trench.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we need more wire cutters!}
<A>__{all at once one, two, three, six pairs of cutters come soaring through the air and splash into the watery crater. moments later peter and the geordie kneel beside joey, each with a pair of cutters. joey is calming down again. the geordie positions himself across joey's body so that when he's cut the wire, it won't coil back and cut joey. peter positions himself to be able to cut the two wires in quick succession, holding the first wire to stop it from springing back. joey's completely still now. peter points between joey's eyes.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{his blind spot. the cutters won't frighten him. if you could cut here, holding this wire }
<A>__{he points to wires that intersect the wire that crosses joey's eye. then he points to the wire across joey's eye.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{i could }
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{say no more, i'm right behind you.}
<A>__{as they reposition themselves, the geordie says to joey:}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{and you understand what's happening, do you not, o best beloved? that you must lay so very nice and still. there's a lad, you're a remarkable horse, you are, helping us help you. there's a lad. there's a remarkable lad.}
<A>__{the geordie looks into joey's huge eye as he and peter get to work on their cutting. joey returns his gaze.}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{so how's things in yonder trench?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{delightful. we read, we knit sweaters, and we train our rats to perform circus tricks.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{well, if ever you need any more rats, we can always send ours over. `cause we've more than we need, strictly speaking. besides, they scare off all the pretty girls.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{our girls aren't afraid of rats.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{big strapping german girls, eh? kind what gives robust massages?}
<A>__{they laugh.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{every thursday! and they bring rum cake on your birthday.}
<A>__{both men smile at this while joey is completely still; they work quickly, in concert, cutting the horse's head free of the wire. joey raises his head, gives it a shake, neighs and then stirs a little. the two soldiers smile at one another. then they set about cutting the rest of the wire; it's much easier now. the geordie cuts through the last wire binding joey's legs. the two soldiers help as the horse staggers upright.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{look at that horse! look at the muscles he's got, them long legs. they're made for running, horses. runnin' away from danger.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{running away is all they have.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{yet we taught `em opposite. running into the fray.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{war horse.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{yeah. war horse. and there he is. what a strange beast you've become.}
<A>__{the geordie grabs hold of joey's halter, though joey shows no sign of running. joey is finally free. the two men look at each other.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{and now?}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{i take him back with me, yeah?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{since i supplied the cutters, the horse is mine. this is fair, no?}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{in a pig's eye. he's english, plain to see.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh, you mean because he's so filthy?}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{because he's so smart. and you're none too clean yourself.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we could box. and the winner gets the horse.}
<A>__{the geordie smiles.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{no, thanks, pet. must be careful not to start a war.}
<P>__{(patting his pockets:)}
<D>__{do you have a coin of any sort?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{coin toss?}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he takes a coin from his pocket, hands it to the geordie, who looks at it.}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{all right, fritz you're on.}
<A>__{he flips the coin back to peter.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{my name is not fritz it is peter.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{peter i'm colin.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you call it, colin.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{heads.}
<A>__{peter spins it in the air and lets it fall into the mud. they look down. peter shakes his head, resigned.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{that's the face of my kaiser and he does not look pleased with me. the horse is yours.}
<A>__{they collect their helmets as snow begins to blow around them.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{gone quiet, hasn't it?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{but wait half an hour and we'll be shooting again.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{i'm a terrible shot, pete, don't believe i will ever hit the target.}
<A>__{he hands back the cutters.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he notices the geordie has offered his hand, as well. a beat, then peter shakes with him.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{cheerio, mate.}
<P>__{(re joey:)}
<D>__{you'll take good care of him, yes?}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{i will.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{our strange beast.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{and you take care of your own strange self.}
<A>__{peter tosses geordie his cutters.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{colin! a pair of german cutters in memory of your handsome friend from dusseldorf.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{peter nods, and walks back to his trench. as he goes, the geordie calls after him:}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{i will use `em back in the garden in south shields. you keep your head down, now, pete me lad!}
<A>__{as he walks away, peter turns back briefly, calling:}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{remarkable! a remarkable horse!}
<A>__{the geordie leads joey towards the british trenches.}
