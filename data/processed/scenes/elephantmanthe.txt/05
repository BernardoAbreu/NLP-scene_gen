<T>__{dissolve to outside the shop:}
<A>__{a cabman is knocking on the door of the shop, staring at the portrait. the door opens, revealing a figure in a floor length black cloak. on his head is an extremely large hat, cut to the lines of a yachting cap. a grey flannel curtain hangs from the bottom of the cap all the way around, hiding his face. there is a horizontal slit in front for the eyes. on the figure's feet are large, bag like slippers. the only part of the body seen at all is the left arm and hand, which protrudes from the cloak, holding a crude walking stick. the figure seems to loathe being in the open. we can just barely see in the darkness within the owner standing to one side of the door, obviously enjoying the surprise on the cabman's face. the owner steps abruptly into his view.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{don't just stand there. help him up.}
<A>__{the cabman, does so, while a small, curious crowd forms. the owner gives the cabman the card. the cabman jumps up onto the seat and off they go. the receiving room london hospital the receiving room is a bare hall, painted stone color. it has rows of benches and a long desk where entries are made, and certificates and other papers are issued. it is a cold, harsh place.}
<C>__{cabman}
<D>__{not at all, sir. my... pleasure.}
<A>__{he exits. treves turns and sees the matron, staring.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i will be in my rooms, mothershead. i'm not to be disturbed.}
<A>__{she nods silently. treves looks at the figure for a moment.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{come with me, please.}
<A>__{he starts to go out of the room. the hooded figure just stands there, motionless. we see the whole room, the people now silent. they all stare at the figure. no one makes a move.}
<C>__{matron}
<D>__{you heard the doctor... go on.}
<A>__{treves turns to look at the hooded figure who stands there a moment, then slowly shuffles after him. mrs. mothershead and the people in the room watch him go. when he is out of sight, they all begin to talk excitedly. mothershead stands fixed and watches too, ignoring the noisy room. treves' office the door opens and treves leads the hooded figure to a chair in front of his desk and helps him to sit down, furtively trying to look into the eye slit of the mask. in the small room the smell of the elephant man is overwhelming. treves goes to the window and opens it. he nervously tries to compose himself, then turns to the hooded figure.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{my name is frederick treves... i am a surgeon here at the london hospital, and i lecture in anatomy at the medical college... i would very much like to examine you. would that be all right?}
<A>__{the figure in the chair is still. treves is at a loss. his sense of discomfort is growing. he looks at the floor for a moment, then locks his eyes on the figure's left arm.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{ah... yes. um, first i would like to ask you a few questions, would that be all right?}
<A>__{the figure does nothing. treves sits down at his desk and picks up a pencil.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{good. now, let's see. your owner... um, the man who... who looks after you tells me that you are english and your name is john merrick. is that correct?}
<A>__{the figure does nothing.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{do you know where you were born? where you come from?}
<A>__{the figure does nothing.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i tell you what, i will ask you a question, and you shake your head like this for "no" and nod like this for "yes", alright? do you understand?}
<A>__{the figure following treves' movements nods very slowly, "yes". treves sighs with relief.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{are you in any pain?}
<A>__{the figure begins to babble incoherently. treves, alarmed, interrupts.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{um, no. just nod your head like this for "yes" and shake it like this for "no". now, are you in any pain?}
<A>__{again the figure, following treves movements, shakes his head "no".}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{are your parents still alive?}
<A>__{the figure does nothing. treves is quite nervous.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{do you understand? are they dead? your father... your mother?}
<A>__{the figure begins to moan. there are two sharp raps at the door. the hooded figure flinches. the door opens and fox pokes his head into the room.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{freddie, what you doing for... i say do open a window in here or...}
<A>__{he notices the hooded figure.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{oh, i'm dreadfully sorry, i had no idea that... i say!}
<A>__{treves quickly rises and pushes fox out into the hallway, following him and closing the door.}
<B>__{in the hallway}
<A>__{treves and fox are standing outside the door to treves' office.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{good lord, freddie! what have you got in there?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{you'll know presently. at the meeting of the society. but until then, i beg of you fox, keep it to yourself.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{certainly, if you insist. you must have quite a find there.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i don't know what i've got.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{nothing of any importance, eh?}
<A>__{treves turns to go back in, then stops.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i will tell you this much, fox, it's beyond anything you or i have ever dealt with. keep it to yourself, please.}
<A>__{he goes back in, shutting the door. treves' office treves turns the key in the door. he turns to the chair the figure had been occupying, but he is not there. the figure is hiding in the corner, crouched behind a black frock operating coat, so stiff with dried blood and pus it stands up by itself. treves looks quickly around the room and finally sees him. he looks at the figure for a moment.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{come sit down.}
<A>__{the frightened figure just crouches there looking at him. treves goes to him, pulls him up and over to the chair.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{sit... down.}
<A>__{the figure sits. treves pauses uncertainly.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i think i will examine you now. i will save the questions for later... will you take off your hat now, please?}
<A>__{the figure does nothing. treves moves to him.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{don't be frightened, i simply want to look at you. do you understand?}
<A>__{the figure leans back fearfully. from behind him we see just the top of his wide hooded head. treves, standing before him, lifts the hood up and back.}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(more to himself)}
<D>__{that's right, don't be frightened. don't be frightened.}
<A>__{small room london hospital we see two cameras set up, their operators next to them staring at something we cannot see. treves stands beside them concentrating on the same sight. all three are speechless. treves suddenly remembers himself.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{are you ready?}
<A>__{the cameramen mumble, "yes", and gratefully disappear beneath the black cloths of their cameras.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{they trigger the flash powder. in the blinding flashes we briefly see the silhouette of a tremendously bulky figure, starting at the light.}
