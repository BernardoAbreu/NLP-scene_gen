<L>__{interior apartment night}
<A>__{a woman's apartment, decorated in pastel pinks and mauves. original paintings and sculptures everywhere. the place reeks of money. in the foreground: a man's hand, long, elegant, manicured. manipulating a deck of cards, doing a one handed shuffle with extraordinary finesse. in the background: a tv set tuned to the 11 o'clock news, with highlights of harvey dent's campaign speech.}
<C>__{dent}
<P>__{(on the tv screen)}
<D>__{together we can make gotham city a safe place for decent people to live and work and play.}
<A>__{the hand sets the deck on an end table, raps it twice, turns up four aces off the top. this most unusual deck sports a .22 calibre bullet hole straight through the middle.}
<C>__{jack napier}
<D>__{decent people shouldn't live here. they'd be much happier someplace else.}
<A>__{jack napier, 32, is right hand man and chief enforcer to boss carl grissom. his features are delicate, almost feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his appearance. he is also absolutely merciless. he trains a cold eye on dent's televised image as alicia hunt 26, beautiful, carl grissom's kept woman glides over in her negligee and snuggles up.}
<C>__{alicia}
<D>__{anything new?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the usual gas. if this clown could lay a hand on grissom... i would've had to kill him by now.}
<A>__{alicia finds jack's necktie draped over a nearby chair. she begins knotting it playfully about his neck.}
<C>__{alicia}
<D>__{if grissom knew about us... he might kill you.}
<A>__{jack seems uninterested in her affections. his eye darts back and forth between the tv and his own reflection in a nearby vanity.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't think so, angel. i'm too valuable. that's the way i've planned it.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{and besides, he doesn't know.}
<A>__{jack checks his watch, reaches for his topcoat, and stands in front of the vanity. he runs a hand through sculpted hair, checks out his albert nipon ensemble.}
<C>__{alicia}
<D>__{you look just fine, jack.}
<A>__{he smiles at himself before turning to the door.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{... i didn't ask.}
