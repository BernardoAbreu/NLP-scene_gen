<D>__{the sun parched indian grass and turkey toot are wilting but stirred by prairie winds. bev's old lincoln follows a thread of blacktop through the tall grass. barb drives, ivy up front. karen's in the back with violet.}

<D>__{i'm going to be sick. barbara looks back, sees her mother means this literally, pulls to the side of the road. violet gets out quickly. we stay with barbara as she climbs out of the car, stares across the road, waiting for violet, who can be heard retching. karen and ivy still in the car. the sound fades as barbara contemplates the prairie and for a long moment... loses herself, back to this land, to her home. her expression is unreadable, enigmatic. then behind her, out of focus, we become aware of violet running away, across the prairie, through the tall grass. barbara turns, simply to get back in the car, sees violet running through the field.}

<D>__{mom? violet keeps running.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{mom?! where are you going? barbara watches for another moment.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{goddamn it. mom! barbara takes off after her. ivy and karen climb out, but don't follow. shield their eyes to watch the chase. it's an odd sight, the two women, racing through the grass. one almost seventy, the other nearing fifty. barbara is slow in her pursuit at first, maybe because of her shoes, or maybe because she just feels silly. then realizes that violet is not stopping... not unless barbara stops her. violet runs through the tall grass, puts a foot wrong, goes down. barbara catches up, out of breath, collapses. they lay on the ground, wheezing, sweating.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{where the fuck are you going, mom? and now we see the full beauty of the land, the distant horizon, the high cumulous clouds, the endless blue sky. barb and violet two dots, lost in the unforgiving prairie.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{there's nowhere to go.}
