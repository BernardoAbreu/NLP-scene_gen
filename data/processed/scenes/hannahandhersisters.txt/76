<P>__{(gesturing with his hands full)}
<D>__{i will either be unconscious or i won't. if not, i will deal with it then. i'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when i'm unconscious.}

<D>__{mom, come out!}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(offscreen in the bathroom)}
<D>__{of course there's a god, you idiot! you don't believe in god?}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{but if there's a god, then wh why is there so much evil in the world?}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{what just on a simplistic level. why why were there nazis?}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(offscreen in the bathroom)}
<D>__{tell him, max.}
<A>__{mickey, reacting, hits his forehead.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{how the hell do i know why there were nazis? i don't know how the can opener works.}
<A>__{mickey starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to: a beautiful snow covered church downtown, complete with courtyard and wrought iron fence. a pedestrian walks by with an umbrella. a church choir sings a soaring hymn over the scene. the music continues as the film moves inside, where the choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold. a fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film cuts to the back, where mickey, his arms crossed, stands underneath some stained glass windows, watching and listening to the inspiring music. the choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to father flynn in his office. he picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his window and he walks over to mickey, who's standing near his desk, already holding several tomes. father flynn puts the books on top of mickey's pile; mickey, flipping through the top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door. next is seen a close up of a painting of jesus christ on the cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression. his eyes, especially designed to blink as the lights hit them, open and close repeatedly. the hymn plays on, loudly, as the camera moves back, revealing mickey, standing outside a barber shop window, looking at the christ playing and shuffling from side to side to gets its eyes' 3 d effect. smaller inspirational pictures border the bigger, blinking christ. a barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby; passing traffic is reflected in the window. mickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open air displayed flowers, past several briskly moving pedestrians. with the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly. mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating him. he's just entered his apartment. he closes the door and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag. he switches on the light, and walking past his spiral staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he makes his way to his living room coffee table. mickey pulls a crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on the table near a pile of books and some objets d'art. he then takes out a copy of the new testament, putting it on top of the crucifix. then out comes a framed picture of a sainterior it too gets put on the growing pile. but the bag is not yet empty. next comes a large loaf of wonder bread and a large jar of hellman's mayonnaise. mickey sets them on top of the sainterior}
