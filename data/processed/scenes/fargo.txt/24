<A>__{bright looking through a windshield it is a starky sunny day. we are cruising down a street of humble lookalike houses. we pan right as we draw toward one house in particular. in its driveway a man in a hooded parka shovels snow. he notices the approaching car and gives its driver a wave. the driver is gary, the brainderd police officer. he gives a finger to the head salute and pulls over.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{gary slams his door shut and the other man plants his shovel in the snow.}

<D>__{officer olson.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{yah, right o.}
<A>__{the two men caucus the driveway without shaking hands and without standing particularly close. they stand stiffly, arms down at their sides and breath streaming out of their parka hoods. each has an awkward leaning away posture, head drawn slightly back and chin tucked in, to keep his face from protruding into the cold.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{... so, i'm tendin' bar there at ecklund && swedlin's last tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'so where can a guy find some action i'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.' and i says, 'what kinda action?' and he says, 'woman action, what do i look like,' and i says 'well, what do i look like, i don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'i'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and i says, 'well, this ain't that kinda place.'}

<C>__{man}
<D>__{and then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. so i don't say nothin' and he says, 'what do ya think about that?' so i says, 'well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{ya got that right.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{and he says, 'yah, that guy's dead and i don't mean a old age.' and then he says, 'geez, i'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{white bear lake?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{well, ecklund && swedlin's, that's closer ta moose lake, so i made that assumption.}
<C>__{gary}

<C>__{man}
<D>__{so, ya know, he's drinkin', so i don't think a whole great deal of it, but mrs. mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought i should call it in, so i called it in. end a story.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{what'd this guy look like anyways?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin'.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{uh huh in what way?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{just a general way.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{okay, well, thanks a bunch, mr. mohra. you're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.}

<D>__{yah, got a front movin' in.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{ya got that right.}
<B>__{close on carl showalter}
<A>__{in his car, now parked, one hand holding the rag pressed to his mangled jaw. he is staring down at something in the front seat next to him. his other hand holds open the briefcase. it has money inside a lot of money. carl unfreezes, takes out one of the bank wrapped wads and looks at it.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{... mmmnphh.}
<A>__{he paws through the money in the briefcase to get a feeling for the amount.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{... jeshush shrist... jeshush fuchem shrist!}
<A>__{excited, he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto the back seat. he starts to take the rag away from his chin but the layer pressed against his face sticks, its loose weave bound to his skin by clotted blood. he pulls very gently and winces as blood starts to flow again. he carefully tears the rag in half so that only a bit of it remains adhering to his jaw.}
