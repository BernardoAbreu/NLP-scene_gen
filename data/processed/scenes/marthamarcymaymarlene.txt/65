<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{we cooked last night.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<A>__{martha is lost deep in thought.}
<C>__{martha }
<D>__{do you ever have this thing where you can't tell if something's a memory or if it's something you've dreamed?}

<C>__{lucy}
<A>__{really?}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{we were far apart.}
<C>__{lucy}
<A>__{sometimes i wonder if, maybe i could have taken better care of you.}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(mumbles)}
<A>__{the past doesn't matter.}
<C>__{lucy}
<A>__{it does matter.}

<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i don't need your guidance, i never did. i'm a teacher and a leader, you just never let me be that but now i know i am, i know who i am.}
<C>__{lucy}

<A>__{martha doesn't respond she drifts off into deep thought.}
<C>__{lucy }
