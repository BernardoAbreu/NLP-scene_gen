<A>__{rafe's plane settles down toward the water; he guns the engine to level out, and the plane skims across the surface; then the propellers catch and the plane stops like it hit a wall, flipping over it's nose. danny's plane is struggling; when he tries to add throttle, the engines sputter out. the plane drops, skips once on the surface, then hits a shoreline rock belly first. danny and anthony are ejected through the top of the fuselage; coma is hurled forward right through the glass nose of the plane.}
