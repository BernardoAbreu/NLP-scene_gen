<L>__{exterior inside the industrial complex day}
<A>__{the anarchy 99 guys seem to have a whole other army in here. guards spill onto the road, shooting at them from everywhere. a belly panel on the gto opens and ping pong ball sized minibombs dump onto the road. blam! blam! blam! the bombs send the guards scattering. the gto sizzles away.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{where'd the damn truck go?!}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{go to the water, it's that way!}
<A>__{a tactical (a pick up with a .50 cal machine gun attached) pulls up behind them and opens fire.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{toadies right behind.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{let me.}
<A>__{petra punches another button. the rear hubcaps pop off. they roll along the road on their own. inside they seem to be lined with spikes. as the tactical pulls up in between the hubcaps they blow up, spraying spikes at both sides of the tactical. all four wheels blow out and the tactical goes out of control. it crashes through a fence and pitches into the water, the men going sprawling.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{fantastic options.}
<A>__{at the riverbank yorgi and kirill pull ahab off the truck and prepare for launching. they remove it from it's box and carry it waist deep into the water. yorgi opens a panel and works feverishly on ahab's insides.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{i've got it, go! cover me!}
<A>__{kirill grabs his sniper rifle and heads off. he climbs up to a second story window of a wooden building on a wharf. from here he can shoot and not be seen. he takes his lit cigarette and tucks it behind his ear. when the gto rounds the corner he fires. the bullet goes through the window and slams into the steering column. xander jams it into reverse. they retreat behind a building. petra clutches her arm, wounded.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{a piece of shrapnel hit me.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i'm sick of that guy. let's stop playing nice.}
<A>__{kirill chambers another bullet and waits for them to make their second approach. the gto comes roaring out, spinning in circles wildly. xander's is just doing donuts as fast as he can. kirill aims, but with all the dust being kicked up he doesn't have much of a target.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{what are you doing!}
<A>__{he doesn't notice petra pop up from behind a fence with a}
<B>__{heat seeking missile launcher.}
<A>__{angle on the missile launcher's computer screen. the green display shows a faint red glow in the upstairs window. its the glowing point of kirill's lit cigarette. the launcher beeps as it locks in and she fires. kirill looks up to see the missile blazing down the wharf at him. he gets it immediately. in a panic he fumbles for the cigarette... too late. the missile zeroes in on his head. whooosh! the entire wooden shack blows apart. xander walks up to petra.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i guess the surgeon general was right.}
<A>__{angle on ahab as yorgi flips a switch and let's it go. the electric motor purrs to life and ahab zips out into the river. xander and petra run to the water's edge in time to see yorgi escaping in a motorboat. in the opposite direction they see the ripples of ahab as it speeds towards it's destination. petra finds the controller in the cab of the truck. she presses buttons desperately.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{he's shut out the communication circuit!}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you can't talk to it?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{no, it's like a safety. we are going to have to access the manual controls.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{a manual control on a moving torpedo. this day keeps getting better and better.}
<A>__{xander starts running towards a second moored motorboat.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{radio ivan! tell him what's going down! have them evacuate downtown!}
