<L>__{interior gib's car night}
<A>__{gib is sitting in the car, in the shadows, up the street... with his earphone in place. listening.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{harry, this is your conscience speaking...}
<L>__{interior tomb night}
<A>__{juno picks up the lamp and walks along the wall, holding it up so that the flickering shadows seem to bring the bas relief figures to life. stone faces shift and change, stone eyes move.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{look at this. people who dies twenty centuries ago.}
<A>__{juno presses her cheek against the cold stone. she runs her fingers slowly across the figures. it is strange and erotic.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{they breathed and loved and wept, just like us. and now their ideals, their religions, their social orders... are gone like mist. what did any of it matter?}
<A>__{she crosses to harry.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i only hope they lived well. that they got what they wanted.}
<A>__{she puts her hands on him and pulls herself close. it is a hypnotic moment.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{getting what you want is the only important thing.}
<A>__{she kisses him, very lightly, with infinite sensuality.}
