<L>__{exterior scottish highlands day}
<A>__{robert the bruce, flanked by the noblemen and the banners of the scottish throne, and backed by a ragtag army of scots, sits on his horse and looks down at the english generals in their martial finery. the english are haughty, victorious, at the head of their colorful, polished army, awaiting the ceremony of submission from scotland's new king.}
<C>__{robert }
<D>__{and i, robert the bruce, backed by a body of scottish veterans, rode out to pay homage to the armies of the english king, and accept his endorsement of my crown.}
<A>__{from below, on the open plain day the scots the remains of william wallace's army look so ragged and defeated that it hardly seems worth the wait. one english commander turns and jokes with another...}
<C>__{english commander}
<D>__{i hope you washed your ass this mornin it's never been kissed by a king before.}
<A>__{up on the hill, robert the bruce sits on his horse, and waits. he looks down at the english generals, at their banners, their army. he looks down the ranks at his own. he sees hamish. stephen. old macclannough is there, his eyes watery, his weapon sharp. the scottish bride lord bottoms took is there, among the ragtag archers, her husband beside her. robert knows none of them yet he knows them all. old craig, among the other scottish nobles mounted beside the bruce, grows impatient.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{come, let's get it over with.}
<A>__{but robert holds something uncurling his fist, he looks at the thistle handkerchief that belonged to wallace. the nobles start to rein their horses toward the english.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{stop.}
<A>__{robert the bruce tucks the handkerchief safely behind his breastplate, and turns to the highlanders who line the hilltop with him. he takes a long breath, and shouts }
<C>__{robert the bruce}
<D>__{you have bled with wallace! now bleed with me!}
<A>__{bruce's broadsword slides from its scabbard. a cry rises from highlanders, as from a tomb, rising }
<C>__{scots}
<D>__{wal lace! wal lace! wal lace!}
<A>__{the chant builds to a frenzy; it shakes the earth. the scottish nobles can scarcely believe it; the english are shocked even more. robert the bruce, king of scotland, spurs his horse into full gallop toward the english, and the highlanders hurl their bodies down the hill, ready to run through hell itself. in slow motion we see their faces... and over this, we hear the voice of william wallace...}
<C>__{wallace's voice}
<D>__{in the year of our lord 1314, patriots of scotland, starving and outnumbered, charged the fields of bannockburn. they fought like warrior poets. they fought like scotsmen. and won their freedom. forever.}
<A>__{on wallace's army behind robert the bruce, charging down the hill to victory and glory, we slow to freeze frame and hear their chant, huge, echoing...}
<C>__{scots}
<D>__{wal lace! wal lace! wal lace!}
