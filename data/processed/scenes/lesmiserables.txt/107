<L>__{exterior barricade night}
<A>__{it is night. the students have been waiting for hours. a single flaming torch atop the barricade caged in by cobbles underlights a fluttering red flag. there is no sign yet of any opposition. a boy climbs down from sentry duty on the barricade. marius realizes its eponine. she sits down with her back to him.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{hey, little boy, what's this i see? god eponine the things you do!}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{i know this is no place for me, still i would rather be with you!}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{get out before the trouble starts! get out, `ponine, you might get shot!}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{i've got you worried now, i have! that shows you like me quite a lot...}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{get out!}
<A>__{joly, sentry on the main barricade, sees a figure approach.}
<C>__{joly}
<D>__{he's back!}
<A>__{javert, still in his disguise as a rebel, is let back through the guarded `gate' into the barricaded street.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{listen, my friends, i have done as i said. i have been to their lines, i have counted each man. i will tell what i can. better be warned they have armies to spare and our danger is real we will need all our cunning to bring them to heel.}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{have faith! if you know what their movements are we'll spoil their game. there are ways that a people can fight we shall overcome their power!}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{i have overheard their plans. there will be no attack tonight. they intend to starve you out before they start a proper fight concentrate their force, hit us when it's light }
<C>__{gavroche}
<D>__{liar!}
<A>__{they all look up. there's gavroche, on the top of the barricade.}
<C>__{gavroche}
<D>__{good evening, dear inspector. lovely evening, my dear! i know this man, my friends. his name's inspector javert! so don't believe a word he says cause none of it's true. this only goes to show what little people can do.}
<A>__{guns swing round to aim at javert. he stares back in defiance. gavroche comes dancing down the barricade to courfeyrac's delighted embrace.}
<C>__{courfeyrac}
<D>__{bravo, little gavroche! you're the top of the class!}
<A>__{gavroche grabs grantaire's red cap and puts it on his own head, mimicking the students.}
<C>__{prouvaire}
<D>__{so what are we going to do with this snake in the grass?}
<A>__{enjolras faces javert.}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{tie this man and take him to the tavern in there! the people will decide your fate, inspector javert!}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{shoot me now or shoot me later every schoolboy to his sport! death to each and every traitor! i renounce your people's court!}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{take this man. bring him through. there is work we have to do.}
<A>__{javert is led into the cafe. as they pass through the front door only one student is holding javert. seizing his opportunity, javert breaks free and the students have to subdue him by force. javert is on his knees and is being tied to the staircase.}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{when are they coming!?}
<A>__{silence. suddenly, out of the darkness, the students and citizens at the barricade here an ominous distant sound. the sound of marching feet, hundreds of men, marching in unison. first soft, then building louder and louder, closer and closer. boots on cobbles. the sound comes right into the end of the street. enjolras and all the students man the main barricade. silence. they peer over the barricade. in the pitch blackness, all they can make out is hundreds of gossamer thin slivers. these are bayonets and musket barrels dimly lit by the reflection from the torch. a voice shouts out from the darkness.}
<C>__{army officer}
<D>__{who's there?}
<A>__{at the same time we hear the clatter of guns being levelled.}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{french revolution.}
<C>__{army officer}
<D>__{fire!}
<A>__{a flash turns all the facades of the street bright crimson as though the door of a furnace has suddenly open and shut. a dreadful explosion bursts over the barricade. the red flag falls, the pole sliced through. bullets richochet off the cornices of the houses, bore into the barricade and wound several men.}
<C>__{enjolras}
<P>__{(as students return fire)}
<D>__{comrades, do not fire back! do not waste powder!}
<A>__{in the darkness, the clang of ramrods in muskets the troop reloading weapons. enjolras picks up the fallen flag and is about to take it up when the old man father mabeuf who has seen many insurrections before this takes the flag and runs up onto the top of the barricade.}
<C>__{army officer}
<D>__{who's there? get down!}
<C>__{mabeuf}
<D>__{vive la france!}
<C>__{army officer}
<D>__{fire!}
<A>__{a second volley. father mabeuf falls down dead. while everyone is reacting to the dead old man and the wounded, the men are distracted from noticing that some french soldiers have used the cover of darkness to creep down the street. all at once the first full attack begins. shouts and the rattle of gunfire as soldiers throw themselves up and over the barricade. the students run for their guns and return fire. they are taken by surprise. all could be lost in the first instant. some soldiers make it up to the top of the barricade, where they're driven back by the fierce resistance of the defenders. eponine sees one soldier aiming his rifle at marius she throws herself in front of marius just as the rifle fires and marius is safe. they are being overrun. panic ensues. the gun battle is fierce. marius in a flash of inspiration realises all is lost unless they do something. he drags a barrel of gunpowder to the top of the barricade, grabs the torch and with a face of deadly resolve he tips the torch towards the barrel.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{clear out or i will blow up the barricade!}
<A>__{everyone freezes.}
<C>__{army officer}
<D>__{blow it up then and take yourself with it!}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{and myself with it!}
<A>__{marius brings the torch closer to the powder keg. but already the soldiers have cleared out. marius comes down from the barricade.}
<C>__{feuilly}
<P>__{(to marius)}
<D>__{thank you!}
<C>__{lesgles}
<D>__{what were you thinking!}
<A>__{as everyone surrounds marius in amazement he spots eponine lying propped against the barricade.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{eponine! what have you done?}
<A>__{he kneels by her side. eponine is dying.}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{here... it's from cosette... i kept it from you...}
<A>__{with a struggle she pulls the letter out of her pocket, and pushes it into his hand.}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{don't be too hard on me...}
<A>__{marius is shocked to find blood pouring from her wound.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{eponine, you're hurt! you need some help!}
<A>__{rain begins to fall.}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{don't you fret, m'sieur marius i don't feel any pain. a little fall of rain can hardly hurt me now. you're here that's all i need to know and you will keep me safe and you will keep me close and rain will make the flowers grow...}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{but you will live, eponine dear god above! if i could close your wounds with words of love }
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{just hold me now, and let it be. shelter me... comfort me...}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{you will live a hundred years if i could show you how... i won't desert you now...}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{the rain can't hurt me now... this rain will wash away what's past and you will keep me safe and you will keep me close i will sleep in your embrace at last.}
<A>__{marius tries to comfort eponine in his arms.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{hush a bye, dear eponine you won't feel any pain a little fall of rain can hardly hurt you now i'm here.}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{so don't you fret, m'sieur marius i don't feel any pain a little fall of rain can hardly hurt me now...}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{i will stay with you till you are sleeping.}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{that's all i need to know and you will keep me safe}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{eponine }
<D>__{and you will keep me close and rain.. will make the flowers... grow...}
<A>__{eponine dies in marius's arms. marius looks up at the others, his eyes full of tears.}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{they were the first to fall. the first to fall upon this barricade.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{her name was eponine! her life was cold and dark, yet she was unafraid!}
<C>__{combeferre}
<D>__{we fight here in her name...}
<C>__{prouvaire}
<D>__{she will not die in vain...}
<C>__{lesgles}
<D>__{she will not be betrayed...}
<A>__{they pick up eponine's body and carry her into the tavern.}
<C>__{courfeyrac}
<P>__{(to gavroche)}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<C>__{gavroche}
<D>__{that was my sister.}
