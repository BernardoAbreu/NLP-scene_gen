<L>__{interior jane's apartment night}
<A>__{jane flies into frame, carrying her dress, two large shoulder pads clipped to her bra straps. she is obviously running a little late. now she slips on the dress her pace so quickened that it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal gown; the kind good girls wear on special nights. the doorbell rings... she opens the door while trying to put on her necklace... aaron enters carrying four bulging garment bags and a fistful of neckties.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i spilled some rum on the outfit you picked out. let me show you the alternates.}
<A>__{she eyes the amount of clothing, goes to the phone and dials.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{tom...why don't i meet you there? i've got some last minute stuff i've got to take care of...hey, how did you resolve your dilemma did you rent the tux or buy it...i knew it. how much? wow...okay...see you there...}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i didn't know you were going with him.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{did you bring your grey suit?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{yes...i was thinking that way too... which tie?}
<A>__{she holds them in her hand indicates with the necklace that she wants him to help her... he fastens her necklace while looking over her bare right shoulder as she riffles through his tie collection.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(the clasp in place)}
<D>__{thanks. try this one.}
<A>__{she hands him the tie and he extracts his grey jacket from a bag puts it on and ties the tie... she reaches into a white paper bag full of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a built in atomizer and sprays the air in front of hr and walks into the mist. on aaron's reaction:}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i read about it that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(flaring)}
<D>__{it's not a date. it's co workers going to a professional conclave.}
<A>__{jane, unnoticed, reaches into the paper bag, takes a small box of condoms and drops it into her evening bag.}
