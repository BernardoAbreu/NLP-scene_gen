<L>__{interior 16th precint office day}
<A>__{an office of empty chairs and desks. through the windows we can see the hustle and bustle of the precinct. special agent gunther moonan, still dressed in the same shitty suit, sits behind a desk as rottovich and sobozinski enter.}
<C>__{moonan}
<D>__{gentlemen? special agent gunther moonan.}
<A>__{moonan quickly flashes a badge and his best kodak smile.}
<C>__{rottovich}
<D>__{special agent?}
<C>__{moonan}
<D>__{you are officer richard rottovich. and this would be officer walter sobozinski. i'm looking for jake vig.}
<C>__{sobozinski}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{moonan}
<D>__{i've been looking for this jake vig for some time now. problem is, the guy's the invisible man. a spook, a spectre, a ghost. then, like a gift, jake's good buddy and member of his crew, alfonse moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.}
<A>__{moonan holds up crime scene photos of big al's body.}
<C>__{moonan }
<D>__{preliminary forensics suggests he was. sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time i've been looking for jake, this is only the second time i've even gotten a whiff of him.}
<C>__{rottovich}
<D>__{look special agent moonan... we don't know what you're talking about.}
<A>__{moonan takes out a microcassette recorder and hits play.}
<C>__{rottovich}
<P>__{(v.o. from tape)}
<D>__{don't be an idiot. how hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? if vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand.}
<A>__{click. moonan kills the recorder.}
<C>__{moonan}
<D>__{oh yeah, i almost forgot. the two serious looking gentlemen outside? internal affairs.}
<A>__{the officers look out the window to see two serious looking men in suits.}
<C>__{moonan}
<D>__{do you want to know the first time i had a line on vig? he sent me a birthday card.}
<P>__{(off their silence)}
<D>__{belated, but it's the thought, right? oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. but, then again you guys probably know him better than i do. in fact, i've only met the guy once. but now, now i have you. the next best thing. his partners. his "fix."}
<C>__{sobozinski}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{moonan}
<D>__{you help me catch him. whatever he's into next, i want you to be into. and what you're into, i'm into. if it all goes well, those two guys from iad will never have to hear this tape. i will clear you guys of anything you've ever done with vig under the guise of some cross departmental investigation. this prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.}
<C>__{sobozinski}
<D>__{what do you get out of it?}
<C>__{moonan}
<D>__{peace of mind.}
<C>__{sobozinski}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{moonan}
<D>__{not everyone's on the take, walter.}
<C>__{rottovich}
<D>__{if you feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?}
<C>__{moonan}
<D>__{i want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.}
<C>__{sobozinski}
<D>__{this guy must have been a real pain in your dick.}
<C>__{moonan}
<D>__{literally. it's not a bad deal, gentleman. i get peace of mind. you get detective sheilds. but this is the best part, walter... walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. capice?}
<A>__{rottovich and sobozinski remain silent.}
<C>__{moonan}
<D>__{good. one more thing... you gotta give up the booty. i can't have you guys running around with heroin.}
<A>__{freeze frame on moonan's smiling face.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{let me tell you something about moonan...}
