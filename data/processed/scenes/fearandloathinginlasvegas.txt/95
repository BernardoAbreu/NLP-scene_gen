<A>__{lucy is on the witness stand.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{yessir, those two men in the dock are the ones who gave me the lsd and took me to the hotel.}
<A>__{a doomed duke and gonzo await their fate.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i don't know for sure what they done to me, but i remember it was horrible.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{twenty years... and double castration!}
<A>__{the judge bangs his gavel.}
<L>__{interior hotel flamingo suite day}
<A>__{duke is madly stuffing his suitcase.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{wait! you can't leave me alone in this snake pit. this room is in my name.}
<A>__{duke keeps packing. gonzo is looking worried.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{ok, goddamnit!... look... i will call her. i will get her off our backs. you're right. she's my problem.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{it's gone too far.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{relax. let me handle this.}
<P>__{(dials the phone, snaps angrily at duke)}
<D>__{you'd make a piss poor lawyer. ...room 1600, please.}
<P>__{(to duke)}
<D>__{as your attorney, i advise you not to worry.}
<P>__{(nods towards bathroom)}
<D>__{take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.}
<A>__{duke goes in the bathroom. he finds a little bottle a label: "drink me."}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{you won't need much. just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger beer. adrenochrome.}
<A>__{duke stares wonderingly at the bottle.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{adrenochrome...}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hi, lucy? yeah, it's me. i got your message...what? hell, no, i taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what? no, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. yeah. i left him out there, i stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{i remember thinking, "jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid."}
<A>__{duke dips a match head into the brown bottle studies it tastes it nothing tastes some more...}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(to phone)}
<D>__{but here's the problem. that bastard cashed a bad check downstairs and gave you as a reference. they'll be looking for both of you. yeah, i know, but you can't judge a book by its cover, lucy. some people are just basically rotten... anyway, the last thing you want to do is call this hotel again; they'll trace the call and put you straight behind bars... no, i'm moving to the tropicana right away. i have to go, they've got the phone tapped. yeah, i know, it was horrible, but it's all over now... oh my god! they're kicking the door down!}
<P>__{(throws the phone down; shouts)}
<D>__{no! get away from me! i'm innocent! it was duke! i swear to god!}
<C>__{gonzo }
<P>__{(stomps the phone; moans)}
<D>__{no, i don't know where she is. you'll never catch lucy! she's gone! i swear, i don't know where she is! don't put that thing on me!}
<P>__{(slams the phone down)}
<A>__{gonzo sits back in his chair... watching mission impossible.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{well. that's that. she's probably stuffing herself down the incinerator about now. that's the last we should be hearing from lucy.}
<P>__{(fumbling with the hash pipe)}
<D>__{where's the opium?}
<A>__{duke stares at the back of gonzo's neck. something very}
<B>__{strange is happening to him...}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{i remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. for a moment i thought his mind had snapped that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. but the room was quiet again.}
<B>__{duke clutches the brown bottle.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{where'd you get this?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{never mind, it's absolutely pure.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? there's only one source for this stuff the adrenaline gland from a living human body!}
<A>__{gonzo turns to smile at duke.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{i know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. he's one of these satanism freaks. he offered me human blood said it would take me higher than i've ever been in my life.}
<P>__{(laughs struts}
<D>__{round duke eyes}
<P>__{bright with expectation)}
<D>__{i thought he was kidding, so i told him i'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{i could already feel the stuff working on me the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine maybe i should take a swim, i thought...}
<A>__{duke sees that gonzo is toying with his hunting knife...}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{yeah, they nailed this guy for child molesting. he swore he didn't do it. "why should i fuck with children?" he says. "they're too small." christ, werewolf is entitled to legal counsel. i didn't dare turn the creep down. he might have picked up a letter opener and gone after my pineal gland!}
<A>__{gonzo jabs with the razor bright knife. duke's body is going rigid he speaks through gritted teeth.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{why not? we should get some of that. just eat a big handful and see what happens.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{some of what?}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(spitting words)}
<D>__{extract of pineal!}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(staring at duke with a strange smile)}
<D>__{sure. that's a good idea. one whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.}
<A>__{gonzo grows horns his face becomes a mexican demon mask.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...}
<A>__{a cloven hoof bursts through gonzo's shoe.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{right!}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{... grow claws... bleeding warts.}
<A>__{gonzo's chest expands bony ribs bursting his shirt.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{... then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...}
<A>__{a tail lashes, hoofs strike the floor. gonzo towers a flame red demon!}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{fantastic!}
<A>__{duke is now so wire that his hands are clawing uncontrollably at the bedspread, jerking it right out from under him. his heels are dug into the mattress with both knees locked,}
<B>__{eyeballs swelling.}
<A>__{gonzo demon looms against the ceiling.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{you'd go blind... your body would turn to wax... they'd have to put you in a wheelbarrow and...}
<A>__{gonzo's voice fades away duke's frenzied gaze reveals}
<B>__{gonzo reverted to normal human shape and size.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{man i will try about anything; but i'd never touch a pineal gland.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{finish the fucking story! what happened?! what about the glands?}
<A>__{gonzo, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily... towards the tv now a hundred feet away in the distance...}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{jesus, that stuff got right on top of you, didn't it.}
<A>__{veins stand out on duke's forehead. he is purplish red. over the top! too late, he realizes he is near death!}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{maybe you could just... shove me into the pool, or something...}
<A>__{gonzo shakes his head disgustedly.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{if i put you in the pool right now, you'd sink like a goddamn stone. you took too much. jesus, look at your face, you're about to explode.}
<A>__{gonzo sits back down... watching the tv.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{don't try and fight it, or you'll get brain bubbles. strokes, aneurysms. you'll just wither up and die.}
<A>__{duke falls to the ground, writhing, catatonic, sinking into}
<B>__{paralysis.}
<A>__{and the sound, suddenly and strangely, of the voice of}
<B>__{richard nixon and his distorted face on the tv screen.}
<C>__{nixon}
<D>__{sacrifice... sacrifice... sacrifice...}
<B>__{duke passes out. black screen}
