<L>__{exterior front porch gaskell house}
<A>__{as the front door swings open, sara gaskell appears, riding a wave of jagged party chatter onto the porch.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{well, hello, everyone. terry, good to see you again.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{chancellor. don't you look ravishing.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{aren't you sweet to say so. i was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to oh!}
<A>__{as sara steps forward, her heel catches and she pitches forward ...into grady's arms.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{easy there.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's these goddamned shoes. i don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.}
<C>__{miss sloviak}
<D>__{practice.}
<A>__{sara looks at miss sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific curiosity in her eye.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i don't believe we've met...}
<C>__{miss sloviak}
<D>__{antonia. antonia sloviak }
<A>__{just then, a thickly mucscled dog with very strange eyes skitters around the corner, barking savagely in the general direction of grady.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{poe!}
<C>__{crabtree}
<P>__{(mildly)}
<D>__{this wouldn't be walter's dog, would it?}
<A>__{poe continues to rage, his paws doing crazy eights on the hardwood floor, until he's spun himself completely around and is barking at the living room.}
<C>__{miss sloviak}
<D>__{who ' s he barking at now?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{he's still barking at me. he's blind.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{poe' hush! now stop this. honestly.}
<A>__{as poe simmers to a deep growl, grady leans forward.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i need to talk to you.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{that's funny. i need to talk to you, too.}
<P>__{(strategy in her tone)}
<D>__{perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, professor tripp.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(reading her)}
<D>__{i don't believe i know where the upstairs guest room is.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{well then. i'd better show you. terry }
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{we'll just make ourselves at home.}
<P>__{(kneeling by poe)}
<D>__{won't we, poe? yes, yes....}
