<L>__{exterior farmhouse day}
<A>__{eli calls impatiently from the buggy. samuel sits beside him.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{hurry up now, john book!}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{rachel washing dishes turns on hearing book enter. she laughs out loud at the sight of him in his amish gear, and rightly so the pants are highwater, the hat low rise, the jacket ill fitting. book looks self conscious, even a little sheepish. outside another shout from eli.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you'd better go.}
<A>__{book looks embarrassed.}
<C>__{book}
<D>__{my... eh... gun?}
<A>__{the smile fades from rachel's face as she reaches up into a cupboard. she passes the gun in its holster to book. he fastens it about him. the contradiction of an "armed amishman" increases the awkwardness between them. book turns his back to her and checks the weapon. he turns back to her smiling in an odd way.}
<C>__{book}
<D>__{the... bullets?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{oh. the bullets.}
<A>__{she takes them out of a disused coffee jar, passes them to book.}
<C>__{book}
<P>__{(attempting a joke)}
<D>__{not much good without them.}
