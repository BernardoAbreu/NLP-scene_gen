<A>__{victoria sits on a horse and trap. brown steps out and helps her down.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{they're ready now.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{i hope they didn't go to any trouble, john.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{ah, well...}
<L>__{interior estate cottage, balmoral day}
<A>__{victoria steps in to be greeted by all four grants in one military row, smoke still steaming off the fire. brown stands behind her, barely able to contain himself. but for victoria, it is all she's ever known and so she takes it as perfectly normal.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{mr grant. how good it is to see you.}
<C>__{mr grant}
<P>__{(bowing deeply)}
<D>__{your majesty.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{mrs grant. how is your knee? has the pain eased a little?}
<C>__{mrs grant}
<P>__{(bobbing in terror)}
<D>__{oh not so bad, ma'am.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{good. oh and here are douglas and john. haven't you grown?}
<C>__{mrs grant}
<P>__{(still bobbing away)}
<D>__{growing all the time, ma'am.}
<A>__{mr grant remembers himself and gestures victoria towards a chair.}
<C>__{mr grant}
<D>__{will you sit, ma'am?}
<A>__{from his place by the wall, brown notices how easily she smiles as she is led to the chair. she points to a picture on the wall and her good humour is infectious.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{i know that! that's cairn lochan. we picnicked there once, did we not, john?}
