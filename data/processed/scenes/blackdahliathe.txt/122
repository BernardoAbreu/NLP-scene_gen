<A>__{a black maid serves large portions of corned beef and cabbage.}
<C>__{emmett sprague}

<A>__{bucky smiles politely and begins eating.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i want to draw mr. bleichert, daddy.}
<A>__{on emmett's nod martha pulls out a small sketch pad.}
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{you're in for a cruel caricaturing, bucky. maddy's my pretty one, but martha's my certified genius.}
<A>__{a wince from martha.}
<C>__{emmett sprague }
<D>__{what kind of name is bleichert? dutch?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{german.}
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{a great people, the germans. hitler was a bit excessive, but mark my words that someday we'll regret not joining forces with him to fight the reds. i killed a lot of your countrymen during the war.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{did you meet balto out in the hallway?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{very realistic.}
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{an old friend stuffed him. we were in the scots regiment together. georgie tilden. he wanted to work in the flickers.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{so when did you come here?}
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{1920. hollywood was a cow pasture, but the silent flickers was booming. georgie got work as a lighting man, and me building houses. georgie got me introduced to mack sennett and i helped him build that housing project he was putting up hollywoodland underneath that godawful sign.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{i always loved the keystone kops.}
<C>__{emmett sprague}
<D>__{old mack knew how to squeeze a dollar dry, he did. he had extras moonlighting as laborers and vice versa. i used to drive 'em over to hollywoodland after twelve hours on a keystone cops flicker and put in another six hours by torchlight. even gave me as assistant director credit a couple times, so grateful he was for the way i squeezed his slaves }
<A>__{a screech interrupts emmett's monologue. bucky looks across the table to see ramona trying to corral a potato with her fork (the source of the sound).}
<C>__{emmett sprague }
<D>__{mother? are you feeling well? would you like to contribute to the conversation?}
<A>__{ramona forks a small bit of food and chews it daintily.}
<C>__{ramona}
<D>__{did you know, mr. bleichert, that ramona boulevard was named after me?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{no mrs. sprague, i didn't.}
<C>__{ramona}
<D>__{when emmett married me for my father's money he promised my family that he would use his influence with the city zoning board to have a street named after me. but all he could manage was a dead end block in a red light district in lincoln heights. are you familiar with the neighborhood, mr. bleichert?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{i grew up there.}
<C>__{ramona}
<D>__{then you know that the mexican prostitutes expose themselves out of windows to attract customers. i hear many of them know mr. sprague by name }
<A>__{emmett sprague slams the table. plates rattle. silence. bucky stares into his lap as madeleine grabs his knee tightly.}
<C>__{ramona }
<D>__{i will sing for my supper when mayor bowron comes to dinner, but not for madeleine's male whores. a common policeman. my god, emmett. how little you think of me.}
<A>__{she struggles to her feet and leaves the room. her husband follows.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(cheery)}
