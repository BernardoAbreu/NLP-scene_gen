<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior steam bath continuous}
<A>__{a huge room filled with steam. harlin and lupus stand by the door as jake cautiously steps in. new age music is being played could be yanni. sitting in a lounge chair, wearing a white terry cloth robe is the king pin. his large body is less fat than just big, constructed of circles and topped off with the baldest head you've ever seen. a manicurist sits next to the king pin working on his nails.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{ow! watch the pinkie!}
<A>__{this isn't so bad. jake almost has to stifle a laugh.}
<C>__{king pin }
<D>__{every time, you get the pinkie and i get a hang nail.}
<P>__{( to jake)}
<D>__{you jake?}
<A>__{jake nods and the king motions for the manicurist to leave.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{grifter huh? where have you been on the grift? couldn't been here long 'cause i would have heard of you, skippy.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{jake. you can call me jake. here and there.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{here and there, scooter? here and there like boston, chicago, houston? the bay area? some action in london, `til it turned nickel and dime. or how about that little stint down in miami? heard you actually got into some trouble with the feds down there. you guy's pretty good?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i have a good crew.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{minus one.}
<A>__{jake visibly bristles...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{minus one.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{you know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. good suits, good food... the underworld of the underworld. a grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... i like that. i like the idea of that. these days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low.}
<C>__{king pin }
<D>__{it's all take, take, take . you can' t just be fucking witty about it.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i guess it lacks a certain style.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you can't cheat an honest man.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{you can't cheat an honest man. but a man like lionel dolby...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i apologize for the inconvenience.}
<A>__{the king picks up a long, metal nail file.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{honest mistake. just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i can't do that.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{let me rephrase i won`t do that.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{let me repeat why not?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{because you killed one of my crew.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{buddy, that was business. besides, you have more crew. then there's you...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i will get the money back, plus interest. i go on the grift for you. you get a cat, i get a cut. and we get square.}
<C>__{king pin}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{fucking grifters! i love it! you got balls, i will give you that much.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{no. just confidence.}
<A>__{the king pin stands up and moves over to jake.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{i' ll be honest with you, kid. a grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar d k fucking n y suit, cooler than an eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? first thing i have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? you tried it once.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{we got caught. so you know it won't happen again.}
<A>__{with surprising speed, the king pin grabs jake by the neck.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{i know it won't happen because you're going to feel like a prom queen who just got gang fucked by the wrestling team!}
<A>__{a few pained chokes from jake as his knees buckle.}
<C>__{harlin}
<D>__{mr. vig arrived with an escort. nypd.}
<A>__{the king loosens his grip and let's jake fall.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{grifters... always working an angle. alright. i can see you got some vision. but i give you the mark. i tell you the who and you give me the how. lupus go with him.}
<A>__{lupus snaps to attention.}
<C>__{lupus}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{consider him part of your crew. consider him a part of me.}
<A>__{jake begins to speak, but is silenced with a look.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{he goes. now let me see your hands.}
<A>__{the king picks up the nail file again.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{you ask a lot of questions. come on.}
<P>__{(motioning with nail file)}
<D>__{let me see `em.}
<A>__{jake turns to find lupus and harlin on either side of him. they take him by the wrists and hold his hands up for the king.}
<C>__{king pin }
<D>__{i don't like to ask things more than once, junior. i want you to know how much that irks me.}
<A>__{the king begins to gently trace between jake's fingers with the nail file. jake remains rigid against lupus and harlin as the nail file scrapes along the soft, fleshy webbing between his fingers. jake shuts his eyes... then opens them to find the king now gently stroking his hands almost a loving caress.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{you have incredibly soft hands. good cuticles . they' re like a baby's hands. grifters with rough hands... you know that they're probably not that good. means they've had to do some hard labor to make ends meet. but you... smooth... supple.}
<A>__{the king continues to stroke jake's hands with his own meaty paws.}
<C>__{butch }
<D>__{are you insinuating that the king pin is of an alternative lifestyle?}
