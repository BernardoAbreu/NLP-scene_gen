<A>__{marion's tent is set up but he's nowhere to be seen. gabriel walks to marion's gear. finding marion's weapon's belt he opens one of the bullet pouches and finds the paint flecked musket balls made from thomas' lead soldiers. as gabriel takes one, marion steps up behind him.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{if this war is about more than thomas, it's about more than anne, as well. stay the course.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{as you did at fort wilderness?}
<A>__{before marion can answer they see harry lee ride up to them. he dismounts, excited, voluble. he strides over, pleased to see marion, oblivious to his and gabriel's mood.}

<D>__{look at you! i knew you could do it!}
<A>__{lee laughs, picks up a bottle and takes a big pull.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{we have a chance! better than a chance! cornwallis is running to the chesapeake, probably to meet his fleet at yorktown. i wish i could see his face when he sees a dozen french ships floating there. and washington should be a day or two behind him.}

<D>__{and on top of everything, i have a son! born last month in alexandria.}
<A>__{gabriel rises and walks away. lee finally tunes into the pall hanging over marion and the just departed gabriel. he turns to marion.}

<D>__{his wife was killed yesterday. she was with child.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i didn't know.}
