<P>__{(as he stops)}
<D>__{you got great hands.}
<L>__{exterior street jack}
<A>__{jack ain't exactly cary grant, but any guy wearing a tux on these streets doesn't exactly mesh with the milieu. pausing for a flask of whiskey at an all night liquor store, he breaks the seal before he hits the sidewalk and moves on, drinking as he goes. finally, he comes to a nice downtown hotel. slipping the bottle in his coat, he squints up at the glittering building as if sizing up an opponent.}
<C>__{doorman}
<D>__{hey, jackie!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how goes it, tommy?}
<C>__{tommy }

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it ain't always a blessing. my brother here?}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{he's got blood in his eye.}
<A>__{jack glances at his watch, waves to tommy, and moves into the hotel.}
<L>__{interior hotel angle on frank}
<A>__{jack's older brother, frank, is pacing outside the lounge when he sees jack approaching.}
<C>__{frank}

<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(taking out a cigarette)}
<D>__{what's the point?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you want me to show up late a few nights?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{frank. i'm here. i always get here. don't sweat it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{christ, will you look at your hair?}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{jack turns to the wall, which is paneled in tiny tinted mirrors shot through with veins of gold.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's wrong with it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you look like you just crawled out of bed.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no one's gonna be looking at my hair. come on, we're on.}
<A>__{frank just stands there, bottled up with exasperation.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{careful, frank. when you get angry your tie starts to spin.}
<A>__{jack steps into the lounge and frank, shaking his head, follows. as they move away, a cardboard stand up is revealed. on it are two 8 x 10 glossies of frank and jack, and below printed in bold letters, this: "tonight! the doubly delightful tones of the fabulous baker boys!"}
<B>__{baker brothers}
<A>__{as they make their way through the dimly lit lounge and settle behind matching pianos, it becomes apparent that what the "fabulous baker boys" are, in fact, is a poor man's version of ferrante and teicher.}
<B>__{wider angle including lounge}
<A>__{as they begin to plink out their "theme song" tables of middle aged couples sipping enormous banana daiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads. after a few bars, the boys finish with a flourish and the couples applaud.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(mr. smile)}
<D>__{thank you. thank you. good evening and welcome to the starfire lounge. my name is frank baker and eighty eight keys across from me is my little brother, jack.}
<A>__{applause. little brother jack smiles, winks, and takes a draw on his cigarette.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing; could do this in his sleep)}
<D>__{you know, my brother and i have been playing together, gosh, i don't know. how long has it been, jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{twenty eight years, frank.}
<A>__{applause.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{lotta water.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{of course, back then, things were a little different. i was eight, jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'my bonnie lies over the ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, cecil.}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{we must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, jack?}
<A>__{laughter. jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of razor blades.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but seriously. it's been fifteen years since jack and i first stepped on the stage as professionals. three states, sixty eight cities, and more grayhairs then we'd like to admit later... well, believe me, we've seen our share of this crazy country of ours. but even though we've played some of the finest venues in the world ...}
<A>__{at this point, jack begins to mimic his brother's words.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{... there's one place that's always been, for us, a very special place, and that place is... this place, the starfire lounge.}
<A>__{jack lays in a few soft bass chords.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{why? well, i guess you could just say it's the ...}
<P>__{(pregnant moment)}
<D>__{... people.}
<A>__{at which point frank's hands descend onto the keyboard and give birth to the melody of what else? "people.' jack and frank later they exit the stage to applause.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{thank you. remember, room service is available}
<A>__{till one a.m. for you late nighters.}
<L>__{interior hotel kitchen}
<A>__{jack and frank pass through the steamy hotel kitchen.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't make trouble, all right?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{who's gonna make trouble?}
<P>__{(spotting someone)}
<D>__{hey, amigo!}
<A>__{jack's pov man in an apron, cutting meat off a huge soup bone, looks up.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{jack!}
<P>__{(lower)}
<D>__{frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(the feeling's mutual)}
<D>__{yeah, hi, hector.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{gracias.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(as they exit)}
<D>__{i mean it, jack. behave.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{like an angel.}
<L>__{interior office}
<A>__{frank stands across the desk from a young man who, despite his youth, has an irritatingly paternal attitude toward the two men in his office. jack stays in the doorway, smoking a cigarette, as if to venture any further is to risk contracting some hideous disease.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<P>__{(preparing a cash envelope)}
<D>__{terrific, boys. really. terrific.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{thanks, lloyd.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{yes, sir. you're just what we needed on a night like this.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{uh ... thanks.}
<A>__{frank glances at jack and realizes he should have left him in the kitchen with hector and the soup bone.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{only, jack, do me a favor, will ya, pal? if you wanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go play with the niggers on state street. these blisters from the midwest don't wanna watch some guy dripping ash all over himself while he's playing 'the sound of music.'}
<A>__{angle jack smoke curls out of jack's nose. he is utterly still, like a pit bull eyeing a steak.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{okay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more}
<A>__{lessons. by the way, frankie, i'm declaring this. lloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk and, business closed, busies himself with other matters.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{uh ... you don't know when you'll be wanting us}
<A>__{back, do you, lloyd?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i will call you.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, i}
<A>__{thought maybe...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i will call you.}
<A>__{frank bites down and takes the envelope from the desk.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{count it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{count it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jack...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{count the fucking money, frank.}
<A>__{lloyd looks up. jack is staring right into him. reluctantly, frank opens the envelope.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's all here.}
<P>__{(pulling jack out)}
<D>__{i will be talking to you, lloyd.}
<A>__{lloyd doesn't answer. he just looks at jack, smiling with amusement.}
<L>__{exterior street jack and frank}
<A>__{jack comes out onto the street holding the wrapped soup bone, dogged by frank, who's got the cardboard stand up under his arm.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you mind telling me what that was about in there? was that planned? or were you just bored and decided to get creative?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fuck him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{this isn't the pine tree inn on route 81, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fuck him.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{fuck him. great. terrific. fuck him.}
<A>__{the fabulous bakers walk in silence until they come to frank's car. frank opens the trunk and starts to put the stand up away.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so we on tomorrow night?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{maybe thursday. i hear the harpist at the sheraton's got appendicitis.}
<A>__{jack nods and starts to walk away.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{jack stops.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend. say hello to the kids. they've grown.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i hate your kids, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're their uncle.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{only by relation. besides, they hate me, too.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{they don't. they're always asking about you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{they tried to electrocute me, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it was an accident.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it was no fucking accident, frank. the little one ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{cindy.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. how do you explain that?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{she didn't know what she was doing. you're too sensitive.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you got weird kids, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{look, i just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.}
<A>__{jack just stares at frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{just think about it, all right? consider it a standing offer.}
<A>__{frank closes the trunk and moves to the driver's side.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing;like a litany)}
<D>__{you want a ride, jack? no, frank, i will walk. okay, jack, good night. good night, frank.}
<A>__{frank turns the engine over and pulls away from the curb. jack watches the taillights burn into the distance, then takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads for home. angle apartment building jack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment building, where a black labrador is studying him from a second story window.}
<L>__{interior jack's apartment}
<A>__{jack's apartment is small, old, and comfortably cluttered. the most striking item is a vintage phone booth placed against the wall. as jack lets himself in, eddie, the dog from the window, walks over. he is not an overly enthusiastic dog, but you can see from his face that he has a great deal of affection for jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hi, pal. thought you were gonna clean the apartment.}
<A>__{eddie nuzzles the soup bone. jack unwraps the paper and hands it over.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{take it easy, will ya? you're becoming a regular johhny appleseed the way you're dropping teeth around here.}
<A>__{jack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over to an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs. he lifts the records back up the post and clicks on the machine. as bill evans' smoky "peace piece" fills the tiny apartment, jack breaks the collar of his shirt and walks over to the old piano near the window. settling back with the bottle of whiskey, jack rests his elbows gently on the keys and stares out the open window, listening to the music.}
<L>__{interior piano store}
<A>__{jack and frank work opposite sides of a large piano showroom, inspecting rentals of every style and color. willie, the owner of the place, leans against a cheap upright, contemplating his shoes.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what happened to the two clays, willie?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{out.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{when they coming in?}
<C>__{willie}

<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what's the gig?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{two nights.}
<A>__{willie just looks at his shoes and shakes his head. frank frowns and glances around. across the room, jack pauses before another piano.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what d'ya got?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(tapping)}
<D>__{yamaha white. nice.}
<A>__{frank moves to another grand and alternates taps with his brother to see if the two pianos are in harmony.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{try the black knable.}
<A>__{frank moves to another piano and repeats the process, watching jack for a verdict. after a moment, jack nods.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{tag 'em, willie. the regency downtown, thursday friday. thanks.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{my pleasure.}
<L>__{interior diner}
<A>__{the brothers sit at a window of a corner diner, jack nursing an ice coffee, frank playing with a plate of scrambled eggs. the glass next to them is cluttered with photographs of neighborhood luminaries, including two of jack and frank in their tuxedoes.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you know, i think it's been five years since i saw you eat anything. that's the god's truth.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{trust me, you're not missing anything.}
<C>__{frank}

<D>__{seeing anyone in particular?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why the interest?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{because i'm your brother. because i care about you. because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.}
<A>__{jack studies his brother's face.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm not seeing anyone. in particular.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what about that waitress at the ambassador?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{uh uh. how about you? you seeing anyone?}

<D>__{strike a bell?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's only a ring. not a collar.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's more than that.}
<A>__{jack smiles and sips his coffee.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, i mean it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so do i.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we gotta go, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. i won't feel guilty, so i don't gotta go.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{this time you gotta go.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't gotta go.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you gotta go.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{says who?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{your older brother.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're thirteen months older than me, frank. that might've meant something in the apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{christ, jack, it's her birthday.}
<A>__{jack glances up. frank nods.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{so what do you say? think the city can spare you for an afternoon?}
<A>__{jack squints out the window.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{okay. and don't worry about a present. i got her something from both of us.}
<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{jack, cradling a pink bakery box in one hand, gets out of frank's car and surveys the street on which he grew up.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{make sure you lock.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{unless you count the elderly gentleman picking roses three houses down, there would not appear to be a wealth of potential car thieves in the immediate vicinity. but it's not jack's car, so he doesn't press the pointerior}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{place looks good, huh? i got a neighbor boy to mow the lawn, pick up. five bucks. times've changed, huh?}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{see the tree? remember the job cecil did on it the day dad planted it? you can still see the scars on the trunk. really. i was looking at it just the other day. jesus, i thought he was gonna kill that cat.}
<A>__{frank smiles, recalling cecil's near demise, then raps on the front door. jack studies the tree a moment, then gestures to the tiny ribboned box in frank's hand.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so what'd we get her?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you'll see.}
<A>__{angle front door at that moment, the door swings open and ellie baker is there, a vibrant woman in her sixties.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{well, if it isn't the fabulous baker boys!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{how's the birthday girl?}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{a little stiffer, but just as sturdy.}
<A>__{mrs. baker hugs frank, then, a bit awkwardly, embraces jack.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{john. it's good to see you.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(uncomfortable; balancing cake box)}
<D>__{good to see you, ma.}
<A>__{jack looks over his mother's shoulder at frank and mimics "john" with a knowing nod.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{uh, ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. jack. he goes by jack.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{i thought maybe held gotten over that.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{twenty years, ma ...}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{yes, yes. it's just that john is so much nicer. jack sounds so ... crude. when i was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named jack. i guess i just can't help making the association.}
<A>__{jack's eyes slide over to frank as if to suggest he holds his brother personally responsible for this.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{uh ... yeah, well, you know, ma, john kennedy went by jack.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{catholics. what do you expect? oh, well, what's in a name, right? let's go inside and have a look at that cake.}
<A>__{as mrs. baker exits, frank leans over to jack.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{keep her busy, will ya? i have to set a few things up.}
<A>__{frank disappears, leaving jack alone on the porch with the bakery box. jack shakes his head, wondering how he's going to make it through the afternoon, then enters the house.}
<L>__{interior house}
<A>__{the front room is cluttered with his childhood. most noticeable are the pianos: two tiny uprights, perfectly matched, their simulated ivory keys yellowed with age. above them, pressed between glass and framed, are the music ribbons, faded by twenty years of sunlight. finally, there is the sheet music, dusty and dog eared, piled everywhere in drunken stacks. this and all else in the room jack confronts slowly, warily, but with a noticeable dispassion, until his eyes fall upon a photograph. in it, he and frank are standing alonside a tall man in baggy slacks, safe within the arc of his long arms. frank is staring straight into the camera, neat, clean, perfectly posed, but jack, a year younger, his shirt too big, is caught in profile, looking up at the tall man with an almost worshipful gaze.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<P>__{(entering)}
<D>__{well, now, where's everyone run off to? frank?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{downstairs.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{all at once, jack and his mother realize they are alone.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{well, shall we cut that cake?}
<A>__{jack nods and follows her into the kitchen. he places the box on the table and stands off to the side while mrs. baker sets about preparing things.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{so. how are you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fine. you?}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{oh, fine.}
<A>__{silence. jack watches his mother poise the knife over the cake. her fingers are trembling.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{big piece or little?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{huh? oh, no.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{none?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm not much for sweets.}
<A>__{mrs. baker nods.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{how's that dog of yours? what was his name?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{eddie.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{yes. right. eddie. how is he?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he's losing his teeth.}
<A>__{mrs. baker stops and looks up into jack's eyes. suddenly, a noise is heard in the other room.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{sounds like your brothers back with us.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{frank comes stumbling up the basement stairs with an old movie projector and a roll up screen.}

<P>__{(entering)}
<D>__{what's all this?}
<A>__{frank sets the projector down and hands his mother the tiny ribboned box.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{go on.}
<A>__{jack watches from the kitchen doorway as mrs. baker pulls the ribbon off the box. inside is a tiny spool of film.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{why, what's this?}
<L>__{interior kitchen (later)}
<A>__{blank screen, curtains drawn, the room dark. frank clicks on the projector and picks up his cake. mrs. baker close on his elbow, sets her plate on her knees and watches the screen. jack sits off to the side. a title card appears: "for mrs. ellie baker, who made it all possible." mrs. baker gives frank a puzzled look. he just smiles. suddenly, images spring to the screen, obviously footage several years old, showing jack and frank as children, sitting at the tiny pianos, wearing matching suits, smiling matching smiles as they play for the camera.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{oh my god ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{recognize these two characters?}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{i thought these were lost. where did you find ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{in the attic. behind some of dad's stuff.}
<P>__{(pointing with his fork)}
<D>__{look, jack can hardly reach the pedals.}
<A>__{as frank's laughter fills the dark room, jack stares with cold fascination at the screen. suddenly, a jagged cut springs the boys a year later, in the same positions, smiling the same smiles.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{oh no!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together. boy, old man henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, jack?}
<A>__{jack says nothing.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{oh, look at you two. so skinny. and those tiny suits ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{wait. watch. here comes dad.}
<A>__{jack's eyes narrow as the film jumps another year and a man enters the frame, obviously by accident. he is so tall his face cannot be seen. as he dances quickly out of sight, he ruffles jack's hair.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{that man.}
<A>__{as the film jumps again, jack glances at the photograph to his right. the images on the screen flicker softly off the glass of the picture frame.}
<C>__{mrs. baker }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{oh, look how you're growing. my little boys ...}
<A>__{jack's eyes drift from the photograph to his mother and brother, sitting close together in the love seat, laughing. after a moment, their voices fade and jack looks back to the children on the screen, like two tiny men, mirror images of one another. at first the changes are subtle. little jack's tie is askew, his shirt missing a button. but as the years flick by, the brothers resemble one another less and less, until finally, the little boy that was jack is completely gone and in his place is a slouching, tousle haired adolescent in rumpled coat and open collar, a cigarette hanging disdainfully from his lip. a woman's hand darts into the frame and plucks the offending cigarette away in a flash.}
<L>__{interior car}
<A>__{frank and jack are parked in front of jack's building. whispers of steam snake from the mancovers in the street.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i made her nervous.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{her hands. like that.}
<A>__{jack holds out a trembling hand.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{nah. medication.}
<A>__{jack looks over at frank. he nods.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{couple years, now.}
<P>__{(taps his heart)}
<D>__{keeps the beat steady. nothing serious.}
<A>__{jack considers this a moment, then gets out of the car.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{she was glad to see you.}
<L>__{interior jack's apartment}
<A>__{jack lets himself into his apartment and stops. across the room, curled up on the couch, is a little girl. jack takes the girl gently in his arms and carries her to the bedroom. as he folds a blanket under her chin, he pauses. the girl's face is calm, peaceful.}
<L>__{exterior street dawn}
<A>__{the next morning. early. the sun is peeking sleepily between the buildings and beginning to drip out onto the street. suddenly, ringing out over the rooftops, is "jingle bells" not the entire song, just the first two bars, over and over. iht. jack's apartment day jack, on the couch, his arm draped over a slumbering eddie, opens his eyes. across the room, seated at the piano, is nina, the little girl. she stops playing and turns.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{morning. you want coffee? i made coffee.}
<A>__{jack looks into the sleepy face of eddie and sits up. he nods to the coffee. nina goes to the kitchen.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i did the dishes last night. you're missing a cup.}
<A>__{jack rubs his head, then gets up and walks to the window.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{did you break a cup, jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{eddie did.}
<A>__{nina looks at eddie, sleeping on the couch, then brings jack his coffee with both hands.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i practiced the piano last night. two hours. i think i'm ready for 'jingle all the way.'}
<A>__{jack nods. suddenly, the sound of heavy footsteps is heard. jack and nina glance up at the ceiling.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{guess they're up.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sounds big. what's he do?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{process server. ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular. all i know's he came to take the tv one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner. and breakfast.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what happened to the donut king?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{married.}
<A>__{upstairs, a door slams and heavy feet echo in the stairwell. nina peers out the window.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{no breakfast. maybe they had a fight.}
<A>__{two deep thumps sound on the ceiling.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{well, gotta go. teach me later?}
<A>__{jack nods. nina kisses him on the cheek and exits. jack walks over to the couch and gives eddie a nudge.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey.}
<L>__{interior luau lounge}
<A>__{though the plastic palms and grass skirted waitresses of the luau lounge make the fabulous baker boys' presence seem a bit incongruous, jack and frank hold nothing back, giving "mccarthur park" the full treatment. unfortunately, the audience in the luau lounge wouldn't fill a hawaiian haystack and their applause is less than volcanic.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{uh, thank you. that concludes our show for this evening. jack and i only hope you enjoyed yourselves as much as we did.}
<A>__{as the guests wander out, clutching their roomkeys, a freckle faced bellhop comes up.}

<P>__{(tired)}
<D>__{yeah, jimmy.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{mr. simpson asked to see you.}

<D>__{all right, tell him i will be right there.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{tomorrow we close with the 'aquarius suite.'}
<L>__{interior hotel corridor}
<D>__{frank pauses before a door marked "hotel manager." it's half open. inside, charlie simpson, a heavy man in a shiny suit, is throwing darts in the general direction of a dartboard. he's not very good. frank knocks.}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you wanted to see me, charlie?}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{your pay.}

<D>__{take it now.}

<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{what about tomorrow?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we don't need you, frankie.}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's all there. both nights.}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{so maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{vacation? christ, charlie, it's a monday night. you said so yourself.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it wasn't half full out there tonight, frankie. i got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball. i gotta move the liquor. to move the liquor, i gotta fill the tables. it's a matter of economics. me, i love you. i love both you guys, you know that. you're class. but people today. they don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.}
<L>__{interior hotel lobby}
<A>__{jack rises as frank passes through the lobby with the cardboard stand up.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's with charlie?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{nothing. everything's great. terrific.}
<L>__{interior frank's house}
<A>__{with the stand up under his arm, frank enters and closes the door quietly. a light is glowing in the kitchen. the rest of the house is dark, quiet. in the kitchen, he checks the message pad by the phone. nothing. on the table, a plate of cold chicken is waiting for him. next to it is a stack of bills with a note attached: "frank. please." frank sighs and leans the stand up against the wall. the photo of jack is peeling off the cardboard. finding a stack of glossies in a drawer, frank removes the old jack from the stand up and replaces it with a new one. as he presses the photograph in place, his eyes drift to the one of himself. it was taken a long time ago.}
<L>__{interior jack's apartment}
<A>__{jack places a record on the turntable and sits at the piano by the window. as the needle hits the spinning disc, a sharp, snappy bass line reverberates throughout the apartment. jack takes a drink, then joins in with the record, playing along. his concentration is intense, so much so that, a moment later, when the phone rings, he seems not to hear it. finally, he picks it up.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{it's me.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{frank?}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{yeah. listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i've had enough family for one month, frank.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{it's not family. it's business.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so talk to me tomorrow. after the gig.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{we don't get a gig.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what're you talking about?}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{something came up. don't worry, charlie stayed true. both nights. i will give you your share tomorrow. at the house.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{frank }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{so you'll come out, right?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah, okay.}
<A>__{jack listens to the phone hissing in the dark, then the connection goes dead.}
<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{a taxi lets jack off on a street of shabby tract houses. in his rumpled city suit, jack looks like a cheap gangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers. he walks up to the door of a small white house and presses the doorbell. when there is no response, he goes around to the back.}
<L>__{exterior backyard}
<A>__{the backyard is small, with a short chainlink fence surrounding it. two kids, a girl and a boy, are splashing around in a build it yourself above ground pool. when they see jack, they stop splashing. only their heads are visible above the water.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, kids. dad home?}
<A>__{the two heads say nothing.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what d'ya say? wanna run and get him for me?}
<A>__{still nothing. jack frowns, takes out a cigarette, and pats his pocket for a match.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{the kids' eyes widen at his profanity. jack, the unlit cigarette dangling from his lip, ponders things for a moment, then flicks the'cigarette away and steps over the fence. at which point, the tinier of the two heads in the pool begins to scream.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey, kid. take it easy.}
<A>__{no use. the kid's a world class screamer. frank, wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed, comes racing out of the house.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{cindy! what is it?}
<A>__{cindy points. at jack.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{your doorbell doesn't work.}

<C>__{donna}
<D>__{what's the matter? jack?}
<A>__{jack waves.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(lifting cindy out of the pool)}
<D>__{nothing's the matter. is it, sweetheart?}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{i will take her inside. you too, little frank. out of the pool.}
<A>__{donna shepherds the kids toward the house.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{feet!}
<A>__{the kids wipe their dripping feet on the outside mat and disappear into the house. frank turns to jack.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's probably the excitement of seeing you again.}
<L>__{exterior backyard (later)}
<A>__{donna comes out of the house with a tray of lemonade. the men are sitting by the pool in a pair of webbed aluminum chairs.}

<D>__{you bring trunks, jack?}

<D>__{maybe next time.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{we have some lotion.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{just the same.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{suit yourself.}
<A>__{donna returns to the house. frank takes a sip of his lemonade and scans his surroundings complacently.}

<D>__{nice, huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{the trees. the flowers. nice.}

<D>__{i don't know what you mean.}

<D>__{the hell you don't.}

<D>__{no.}

<D>__{yeah, that's how i see it.}
<A>__{jack shakes his head in disgust.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and don't go shaking your head, little brother. i'm not the one who walks in every night smelling like he's got a day job in a piss factory.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it killed him, you know.}
<A>__{jack glances up. dangerous territory.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a gust of wind killed him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, and what put him up there?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, you weren't there. right?}
<A>__{jack's look ends this. frank sighs.}
<C>__{frank}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{talk.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i been thinking maybe we should make some changes.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sure, why not.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's just an idea. i want your opinion. i mean, we go halfway on everything, right?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's more like 40 60, wouldn't you say?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we agreed that if i took care of the business; i'd be entitled to the extra. isn't that what we agreed?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that's what we agreed.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{if you're unhappy with the arrangement }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm not unhappy.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{if you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, i'd be glad }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{frank. fuck it. okay?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i've tried to do well by you, jack. by both of us.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm grateful, frank. how much? for the singer.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i thought maybe twenty percent. look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead. the big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. we have to stay competitive, jack.}
<A>__{jack laughs coldly.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you, frank. all these years you been telling me we're different. we got novelty, jack. no one can touch us.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{two pianos isn't enough anymore, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it never was.}
<B>__{young woman}
<A>__{in pink sweater and a short black skirt stands in the center of a tiny room in the back of willie's piano showroom, holding some sheet music. sammy davis jr.'s face is on the sheet music. frank is sitting against the opposite wall, a notepad in his hand. jack is at the piano.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{good morning, miss...?}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{moran. monica moran.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{all right, miss moran}
<C>__{monica }
<D>__{actually, that's my stage name.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{moran. monica. the whole thing. it's my stage name. my real name's blanche.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{blanche.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{no romance, right? that's why i came up with monica. it's what i prefer.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, that's fine }
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{but if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for blanche. if you ask for monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{and if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. she's opposed to my career.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{uh huh. well, miss moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{candy man.'}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{is that all right?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's one of jack's favorites.}
<A>__{monica turns and, seeing jack at the piano, gives a little start.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{oops. i almost forgot you were there. here's the music.}
<A>__{monica begins to hand jack the sheet music.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{uh... he knows it.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{really? isn't that a coincidence.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{small world.}
<A>__{monica smiles. she likes jack.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, shall we?}
<A>__{probably not, but jack begins to play anyway, laconically picking out the cheery tune while monica swings her arms and taps her foot. despite all this, monica still manages to come in between beats and jack has to scramble over a chord to catch her, sort of like a fireman with a net.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{who can take a sunrise sprinkle it with dew toss it in the air and make a groovy lemon pie the candy man can the candy man can...,}
<A>__{there would appear to be ample evidence as to why the mother of monica nee blanche opposes her daughter's career.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{thank you, miss moran, that's enough.}
<A>__{monicals eyes are closed now and she is fully caught up. frank looks over at jack. jack shrugs and continues to play.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{miss moran ... miss moran ... blanche!}
<A>__{monica's eyes pop open.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{oh, sorry. i get so caught up in it sometimes. it's scary.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yes, it is.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{well ... thanks.}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{bye.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{drive carefully.}
<A>__{as monica exits, jack and frank glance at one another and thus begins a seemingly endless parade of aspiring singers who can't sing. as frank sinks lower in his chair and jack's ashtray spills over with wounded cigarettes, singer after singer, in all shapes, sizes, and colors, come forth to offer their own unique interpretations of "feelings," "i gotta be me," "this is my song," and perhaps most appropriately, "what kind of fool am i." finally, when it is all over, jack and frank are left alone in the tiny room, looking dazed, exhausted, and mildly homicidal.}
<B>__{tall young woman}
<A>__{as the sequence ends, a tall young woman in high heels walks into willie's. she glances around, then spots willie across the room, eating a corn beef on rye.}

<B>__{jack and frank}
<A>__{are putting on their coats, preparing to leave. frank is staring at his notepad.}

<D>__{thirty seven girls. and not one who can carry a tune. that must be statistically impossible.}

<D>__{so. i'm here, you're here, the piano's here. what d'ya say?}
<A>__{before frank can answer, jack walks over to the piano.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{terrific. thirty eight.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what's that mean? thirty eight.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't worry about it.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{you know, i'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(appealing)}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{catchy. you have any previous entertainment experience, miss diamond?}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{well ... for the last four years i've been on call to triple a escort service.}
<A>__{jack and frank exchange a glance.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey, it's legit. strictly dinner and dance.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay. i think that's all we need to know.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{i sing now?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's the premise.}
<A>__{susie gives frank a dark look, then turns to jack.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{i get along without you.' slowly, okay?}
<A>__{jack nods and begins to play. frank slouches down in his chair, preparing to be tortured again.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing; singing)}
<D>__{i get along without you very well of course i do except when soft rains fall and drip from leaves, then i recall the thrill of being sheltered in your arms of course i do but i get along without you very well.'}
<A>__{susie stops. frank just sits there. jack just sits there. she can sing.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(blinking)}
<D>__{uh ... we'll let you know.}
<A>__{jack looks over at frank like he's insane.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{when we know.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{don't leave a girl hanging. second rule of show business.}
<A>__{frank's not amused.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{yeah, well, okay. 'bye, bakers.}
<A>__{susie walks out barefoot.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what are you, crazy?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i just thought we should talk about it. between ourselves.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's there to talk about? she can sing. that puts her at the head of the class. that makes her the only one in the class.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't know ... she had gum on her lip, for christ sake. i don't think she's right for the act.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(studying him)}
<D>__{you're getting cold feet about this.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i was just thinking what ma would think.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ma? ma? was ma there the last time we played the ambassador? oh, that's right, she was on bass. how could i forget.}
<A>__{frank frowns and looks down at his hands.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{how many other silent partners are there, frank? donna? little cindy? hell, let's give eddie a vote.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay, okay. i will call the girl.}
<A>__{frank gets up wearily, then glances down at the notepad.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i didn't get her number.}
<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{jack and frank dash out of willie's and glance up and down the street. nothing.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we can always look her up in the book.}
<C>__{jack.}
<D>__{right. susie diamond. she's probably listed right next to monica moran.}
<A>__{jack shakes his head in disgust.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{does this mean i get the job?}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{jack and frank whirl around. there, standing in the doorway, is susie.}

<A>__{gleaming beautifully at the start of a new day. once again, "jingle bells" is heard, only this time carried a little further: "jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way..." jack, frank and susie ensconsed in the back room of willie's, preparing for their first rehearsal ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{jack nods.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{susie nods. frank poises his hands over the piano, hesitates, then looks at jack again.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{jack squints at frank, then nods. frank turns to susie.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{what are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?}
<A>__{frank g1ares at her.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{frank poises his hands over the piano again and begins to play the opening passage of "just the way you are." a moment later, jack joins in, and a moment after that, susie. unfortunately, jack and frank, accustomed to playing alone, are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a fifth grade recital. after a few bars, susie holds up her hand.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{fellas, fellas ...}
<A>__{jack and frank stop.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{the problem is i can't hear myself sing with all this...}
<P>__{(searching)}
<D>__{... music. you know what i'm saying?}
<A>__{jack and frank look at one another.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i mean, back there it may be hard to notice, but up here i'm having a little trouble getting a word in.}
<A>__{jack and frank just stare.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(icily)}
<D>__{no. we are not supposed to be backing you up.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{what i mean is }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we're a team. we work together.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{so work with me, not against me. okay?}
<A>__{frank stares at susie for a long moment.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i suppose we can bring it down a little.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will drop the eighths.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay?}
<A>__{susie looks at the two brothers.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{willie's showroom later frank is on willie's telephone. in the front of the store, just out of earshot, jack sits at a beat up grand, while susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm telling you, ray. she's got a voice like an angel ... what?}
<A>__{frank glances furtively across the room to where susie, making a very sexy silhouette against the front window, is running her hand over a pearl white piano.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{no, i wouldn't say she's got a body like an angel.}
<A>__{as frank continues to talk in the background, susie looks over at jack.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{hey, he's not sore, is he?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he'll come around.}
<A>__{susie nods, goes back to stroking the piano.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you never sang before?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{not for money. with my mother.}
<A>__{jack nods slowly, but susie sees he doesn't understand.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{she used to waitress downtown, nights, when i was a kid. on the way home, we'd sing. you know how people whistle when they're nervous? my mother sang. she always said you're never alone with a song 'cause thousands of people know the same song and even though you can't hear 'em, they're singing with you. i don't know. if they were, they were all singing safe inside their apartments.}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{but it worked. we always got home. ever since, i always wanted to sing. i never took lessons or anything, though. i guess you guys took a lot of lessons.}
<A>__{jack looks down at the piano in front of him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah. we took a lot of lessons.}
<B>__{jack and nina}
<A>__{jack's tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets ready for the night's gig. nina, standing next to him at the sink, watches as he works up a lather on a bar of shaving soap, then paints his face with the suds.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{you shave like an old movie, jack.}
<A>__{as jack picks up a razor, nina takes the brush and begins to soap her face in the mirror.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{in the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop. then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{is that what you used to do?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{my days are not the old days, genius.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{what are they?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the recent past.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(nodding to the ceiling)}
<D>__{bigfoot gets his out of a can.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i saw his stuff in the bathroom.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i guess it's getting serious.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i hope not. he's already busted the springs in two chairs. hey, what's this?}
<A>__{nina holds up the handle of the shaving brush.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ivory.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{looks old.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{older than me.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{jack gives nina a look, then begins to splash his face. nina picks up the razor.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, what do you want to do? grow a beard?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{what's a prom?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ever go to church?}
<A>__{nina nods.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's like that. only you gotta dance.}
<L>__{interior hotel}
<A>__{as jack enters the hotel, he passes by the cardboard stand up, prominently displayed in the lobby. it is virtually unchanged, except for a small notation at the bottom: "with guest vocalist." on the other side of the lobby, frank is pacing nervously.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{where the hell is she?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's early.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i told everyone seven fifteen. didn't i? seven fifteen.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she'll get here.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{just like the day of the auditions, right? jesus. how's my hair?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{awe inspiring.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, well, your's isn't.}
<P>__{(taking out a comb)}
<D>__{let me run a comb though it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{get out of here.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{come on, stand still.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{get out of here!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's not gonna hurt you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will hit you, frank. i swear.}
<A>__{frank hesitates, like a basketball player trying to feint an opponent, then takes a flick at jack's hair. jack hits him.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(holding his shoulder)}
<D>__{you hit me.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i told you i was gonna hit you.}
<A>__{he looks capable of hitting him again, too.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{all right, all right. i'm a little tense.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're a fucking alarm clock.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i just wish she'd get here, that's all.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she's here.}
<A>__{susie, wearing a flamboyant orange dress, is standing across the lobby, staring at the stand up.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{christ, look at her. you'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.}
<P>__{(walking over)}
<D>__{good evening, miss diamond. you're late.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{where's my name?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what ?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{and how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we'll talk about it later. right now, you gotta get changed.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{changed?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{where's your dress?}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{what's he talking about?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{is there a language problem here? your dress. for tonight. where is it?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{do i look like i'm naked?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that! you can't wear that!}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{what's wrong with it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's orange!}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{am i missing something?}
<A>__{before jack can reply, frank grabs susie's hand and pulls her toward the door.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{come on. we don't have much time.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{time for what?}
<L>__{interior department store}
<A>__{frank, jack and susie dash through a cavernous downtown department store, the brothers turning a few heads with their tuxedoes. as they reach the ladies' department, frank begins to flip through the dress racks.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{if you ask me, this is pretty stupid.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{just look. what do you wear? a nine?}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{a seven.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{my wife wears a seven. you don't look like a seven to me.}

<D>__{i wear a seven.}

<D>__{okay, okay. here, how about this?}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(looking)}
<D>__{save it for your wife.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we're not exactly silly with time, you know. jack, you find anything?}
<A>__{jack, somewhat out of his element, is looking at belts.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{here, how's this?}
<A>__{frank holds out an inky black dress. susie gives it a long look.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{close enough. let's go.}
<A>__{frank begins to drag susie into the dressing room.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{hey, pal. i don't know about you, but where i come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{all right, but make it quick.}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{shoes! what size do you wear?}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(from the dressing room)}
<D>__{nine.}

<P>__{(holding one up)}
<D>__{how about these?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jack, for crying out loud. your bachelorhood's showing.}
<P>__{(seeing something)}
<D>__{ah, here we go.}
<A>__{frank grabs a pretty blue pump and gestures to the salesman, who's waiting on a woman.}

<D>__{hey! do these come in black?}
<C>__{salesman}
<D>__{i will be with you in a minute, sir.}

<P>__{(glowering)}
<D>__{yes. they come in black.}
<C>__{frank}

<C>__{salesman}
<D>__{does he want a pair, too?}
<L>__{interior dress department}
<A>__{as jack and frank return to the dress department, frank jettisons the shoebox and tissue paper.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{all right, we got your shoes.}
<A>__{just then, susie steps out of the dressing room. even frank stops at the sight of her.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{uh... good.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(turning to jack)}
<D>__{zip me up?}
<A>__{the dress is open down to the small of her back. it's a nice back. jack takes the zipper and closes the panels carefully.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{shoes?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{frank puts the shoes down and susie steps into them.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{they're tight.}

<D>__{we had a little emergency.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah, well, i've got a little emergency. you know what i'm saying?}

<C>__{susie}
<D>__{just a sip. to kill the butterflies, okay?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{okay. but no lipstick.}
<A>__{susie takes a quick sip.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{there. no one's the wiser.}

<B>__{lounge}
<A>__{the audience is laughing.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{but seriously, folks, as i sit here tonight, looking out on all your kind faces, i can't help but feel some of us have met before. we may not know each other's names, we might not recognize one another on the street, but we know each other just the same. and over the years we've shared something. a little music, a little drink, a little laughter, maybe even... a few tears. but i guess that's what friends are for, huh?}
<A>__{applause. jack puts out his cigarette.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, brother.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{and it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and i. this evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady jack and i are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all. she's making her debut here this evening and, as far as i'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the ambassador lounge. ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, miss susie diamond.}
<A>__{applause. susie strides out of the kitchen, past the busing station, and up to the microphone stand, which, unfortunately, is not on.}

<P>__{(continuing; very demure)}
<D>__{pardon me.}
<A>__{jack and frank look at one another, then, before outrage can set in, plunge into the opening number. susie takes the mike from the stand and smiles sweetly.}

<L>__{interior lounge}
<A>__{judging from the faces, susie's as big a hit in the lounge as she is in the lobby. head thrown back, eyes closed, she sings with abandon, finishing on a long extended note, then swooping down in a dramatic, exhausted bow. there is a split second of silence, then thunderous applause. magic.}

<C>__{susie}
<D>__{uh uh. hey, what's this?}

<L>__{exterior hotel}
<A>__{the hotel, done in a sort of king arthur motif,is built right on the ocean. frank guides the car down a simulated cobblestone drive and the three get out.}

<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and how about this air? i'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's paradise. that's what it is. paradise.}

<D>__{you believe this? i'm telling you, we're getting away with murder. two shows a night and the rest of the time we live like kings. it's a crime.}
<A>__{jack stares at the ocean, then at the two beds placed side by side. suddenly susie comes through the bathroom.}

<D>__{good morning, gentlemen. i'm mr. daniels, the manager. i believe i've spoken to one of you on the phone.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(offering his hand)}
<D>__{that'd be me, sir. frank baker. this is my brother jack.}
<A>__{jack, slouched against the piano, smoking, nods.}
<C>__{mr. daniels}
<D>__{tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos. we were assured they were in tune.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yes, well, they are.}
<C>__{mr. daniels}
<D>__{then i'm afraid i don't understand.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{they are in tune. but not with each other.}
<C>__{mr. daniels}
<D>__{is that important?}
<C>__{frank}

<D>__{a mr. reynolds, sir. but he's gone on vacation. i called this morning.}
<C>__{mr. daniels}
<D>__{well, gentlemen, i don't know what to say. not being a musician myself i find it difficult to grasp the magnitude of this. i don't suppose there's any way you could just ... accommodate.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{accommodate? i don't think i know what you mean.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i think what mr. daniels is trying to say, jack, is }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why don't we let mr. daniels tell us what he's trying to say.}
<C>__{mr. daniels}
<D>__{i assure you, mr. baker, no offense is intended. i simply mean, well, we're not a symphony, are we?}
<L>__{interior hallway}
<A>__{frank dogs jack down a hallway.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jack ... jack ... you're acting like a kid.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, that's your problem, frank. you get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three year old.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what's the matter with you? so the piano's a little out of tune. so what?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(stopping)}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no! i never hear it!}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{maybe. sometimes. i don't know. but i won't let it bother me.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{doesn't it matter to you?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. so 'tie a yellow ribbon' sounds a little flat. so what? nobody's gonna hear it, jack. nobody. so why should you care?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{because i can hear it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. understand, little brother?}
<L>__{interior hotel room}
<A>__{frank is adjusting his tie in the bathroom mirror. jack, sitting at the window, his foot up against the glass, drinks from a flask as the sky above the ocean goes dark. after a moment, susie enters wearing a little tuxedo of her own and begins to brush her hair.}

<D>__{thank you, thank you.}
<P>__{(as applause dies)}
<D>__{you know, susie and jack and i only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the king corporation's moorish manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. and it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also. so, if during the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. stop. say hello. introduce yourself. because here, there are no strangers, only friends. and family. right, jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{right. i love you, frank.}

<L>__{interior lobby day}
<A>__{the next morning. as jack passes through the lobby, he hears the plaintive plinking of a piano. curious, he goes to the dining room and peers in. the tables have yet to be set for the evening and, except for frank, the room is empty.}

<D>__{what the hell are you doing?}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what the hell are these?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{dedications. i came up with the idea on the road. see, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room. the guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it. daniels went crazy for the idea.}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{and that's not all. last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability. like he wants to line something up. i think he's got a hard on for susie.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{afraid not.}
<C>__{florence simmons}
<D>__{well, it's frightening. you could be his twin. of course, he doesn't have your talent. musically, i mean. he sharpens things for a living. lawn mower blades, kitchen knives, anything with an edge. can imagine?}
<A>__{jack is having a hard time imagining florence simmons.}
<C>__{florence simmons}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{funny, huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{frank}

<A>__{jack shakes his head and florence starts to aim the camera.}
<C>__{florence simmons}
<D>__{i really hate to impose. it's just that the resemblance is so extraordinary.}
<P>__{(focusing)}
<D>__{i wonder if you could turn this way so your face isn't in the shadows.}
<A>__{as jack turns, he glances over florence's swaying shoulder and sees susie and a man standing at the other end of the walkway. they are leaning into the wind, her hair blowing free, brushing the man's face.}

<A>__{the camera clicks.}

<D>__{we realized that, well, we're really not so different from one another after all. oh sure, we may be at different points in our journey, but we all travel pretty much the same road. and so, with that in mind, we'd like to introduce you to two very special couples. first, married for all of two days, please say hello to helen and bud wilson. helen. bud.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and now, our second couple. i'm talking about ethel and bert lane, ladies and gentlemen. now, ethel and bert would be upset with me if i told you they'd been married for fifty years. why? because, ladies and gentlemen, ethel and bert lane have been married for seventy five years!}
<A>__{the audience lets go with an audible "ooh" and applauds enthusiastically.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ethel, bert. get up here and show these kids how it's done.}
<A>__{a path is cleared and a tiny couple begins to make their way to the dance floor.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{aren't they a sight?}
<A>__{they are indeed, and a sight slower getting to the dance floor than frank anticipated. he nods to jack and they launch into "the anniversary waltz," but have to keep repeating the opening passage while they wait for ethel and bert. finally, everyone on the dance floor steps back and, with some help from a few waiters, who slide a section of tables out of the way, ethel and bert lane begin to dance in the center of the room, slowly but wonderfully, while the younger couple whirls around them like a youthful satellite.}

<L>__{interior hotel corridor day}
<A>__{the next morning. frank, the early bird, is returning to the room with a newspaper under his arm. whistling happily, he rounds the corner just in time to see a man exit susie's room. astonished, then outraged, he goes to susie's door and knocks sharply.}

<D>__{you want to tell me what the hell's going on?}

<D>__{i just saw a man walk out of your room.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{uh ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{in case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here. so it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.}

<D>__{decency? hey listen, pal ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no. you listen. i had my doubts about you from the beginning}

<D>__{some discussion.}

<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he's with the hotel. i called him.}

<D>__{what are you talking about?}

<D>__{he was wearing a suit.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he had to come quickly. it was a big leak.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're a heavy sleeper, frank. you've always been a heavy sleeper.}

<L>__{interior dining room}
<A>__{jack, frank and susie are sitting at a table in the smaller dining room. it is conspicuously quiet. the main course seems to be a conscious attempt to ignore each other. finally, susie looks at frank. then jack. then out the window.}

<P>__{(waits)}
<D>__{hi, honey. she says angela secoli got a puppy for christmas. explain to her why we can't ... i don't know, tell her you're allergic ... it's not lying. well, okay, it is lying, but ... all right, then tell her i will explain it ... he what? ... no kidding? without the training wheels?}
<P>__{(affected by this)}
<D>__{well, that's great. tell him, tell him. i can't wait to see ... no, no new bike. maybe for his birthday ... okay. listen, honey, i have to go.we're on in ten minutes ... yeah, happy new year ... i love you ...}

<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{well, let's go. the public waits.}
<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{a mass of swarming, jubilant people. the voices are high and loud and there's not a hand without a champagne glass. couples lean into one another intimately, dancing gaily between the tables, toasting strangers without hesitation.}

<P>__{(yelling to be heard)}
<D>__{all right, everyone. this is it. let's hear it. ten. nine ...}
<A>__{gradually, the entire room joins the chant.}
<D>__{frank everyone eight. seven. six. five. four. three. two! one! happy new year!}
<A>__{there is a blizzard of confetti as people scramble to find that certain someone to kiss in the new year. in this moment, jack, frank and susie find themselves oddly removed from the frantic cheer below them, their presence suddenly unnecessary, forgotten. finally, susie walks over to frank and gives him a kiss, then goes to jack. they hesitate, then kiss lightly, pulling away and glancing awkwardly into each other's eyes. frank sounds the first chord of "auld lang syne" and susie looks away from jack and returns to her place on the stage. as she begins to sing, the others in the room, all intimate friends for one brief moment, begin to sing with her.}
<D>__{susie everyone lest old acquaintances be forgot ...}
<A>__{as the voices slowly fade, they are joined by the sound of the ocean until the ocean is all we hear and we see:}
<L>__{interior hotel room night}
<A>__{jack, lying on his bed in the dark. he opens his eyes, squinting against the light from the bathroom, then glances over to frank's bed and detects the outline of a body in the darkness. swinging his legs over the side, he sits up on the edge of the bed and rubs his eyes. suddenly there is a rustle of blankets and the shadow in the next bed shifts, falling into the shaft of light cast from the bathroom. it is a little boy. startled, jack stares at the sleeping boy, then hears movement in the bathroom. rising slowly, he walks to the bathroom and gently eases the door open a few inches. inside, swimming murkily in the steamy mirror, is the reflection of a man. his back is to jack, but jack can see that the man is shaving. as jack lets his gaze drop to the floor, he sees that water is dripping off the man's pant cuffs and gathering in pools on the bathroom floor ... jack wakes up. he stares at the ceiling, listening to the waves, then lifts his head and looks to the bathroom. it is dark. turning, he glances at frank's bed. it's empty.}
<L>__{interior dining room}
<A>__{dark and soundless. balloons, streamers and the other debris of revelry cover the tables and floor like snow. frank is sitting at the window, drinking as he stares at the ocean. as jack crosses the room, he looks up.}

<D>__{ah, well, if it isn't the lad with the golden ear. happy new year, little brother.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what're you doing down here?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{celebrating. join me?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the party's over.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, you're wrong. it's just beginning. come on, have a drink. show your big brother how it's done.}
<A>__{frank pours him a glass. jack notices the bottle.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{expensive hangover.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{a gift. courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, mr. daniels.}

<D>__{we, dear brother, are a fucking smash.}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{yup. they want us back. easter. it seems they have this egg hunt every year. only not for kids. adults. they stuff these plastic eggs with timexes and little certificates for free mai tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn. then afterwards, they have a dance. an egg dance. everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open. it's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. slippery business.}
<A>__{frank smiles as he takes a swallow of his drink, then leans his head back, staring at the ceiling.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you know, i've never kissed my wife on new year's. not once in twelve years.}

<D>__{right. it's incredible how you do that. remember things.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a useless talent.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{drove me crazy when we were kids. the way you never looked at the music. miss simpson would just play it and ...}
<A>__{frank snaps his fingers.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{they were simple songs.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{not for me. i still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that? otherwise, i forget. i just forget. but you. you never forget. ever.}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{so how come you couldn't remember ma's birthday?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i told you. it's a useless talent.}
<A>__{frank studies jack a moment, then stares out at the ocean.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{god, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i always think of him on new year's. how he used to pour us each half a can of beer. remember?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you always threw up.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. he loved that about you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he was just having fun.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it was like you'd passed some test, you know?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it was just a can of beer, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, but he told you things. he never told me anything. even though i was the oldest. it was always you two, running off, doing things together.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you could've come.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i could've. but he didn't want me to.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're making things up, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe so.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you ever go back there? where it happened.}
<A>__{jack stares at the angry sea, loud even through the thick glass.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<L>__{exterior hotel day}
<A>__{the next morning. jack is sitting outside the hotel, watching helen and bud wilson pack up the eldorado. the streamers, by now turned to mush, cling like oatmeal to the car's exterior. after a moment, frank exits with a little bag from the gift shop and pulls out a tiny souvenir shot glass.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{want one?}
<A>__{jack shakes his head.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ah well, the kids'll break a couple anyway.}
<A>__{suddenly, across the parking lot, the voices of the newlyweds are heard.}

<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{bud hesitates, then makes a rush for his wife, but she's too quick and runs to the other side of the car. frustrated, he begins to run around the car like a madman, trying to catch her. finally, when he gets close, she darts off, sprinting across the parking lot.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i think i will warm up the car.}
<A>__{overview city cold, dark, dangerous, but somehow looking quite appealing after a week in paradise.}
<L>__{interior car night}

<D>__{that takes care of this week. the tenth we got the sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the capri.}
<C>__{jack}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i can't make the tenth.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{be reasonable, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i play two hundred nights a year with you, frank. how much more reasonable you expect me to be?}

<D>__{thank you. as most of you know, we like to shake things up here every so often just to keep you people on your toes. so i'm gonna take a little rest, grab myself a drink, and let an old friend sit in. he drops by about once a year just to keep his hands clean. ladies and gentlemen. jack baker.}
<A>__{jack rises to polite applause and shakes henry's hand. as he settles behind the piano, he sits for a moment, not moving, then nods to the two men behind him. as they begin to play, we recognize the music from the record. jack waits, then brings his hands to the keys. as he plays, his face is suddenly calm. peaceful.}

<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(at window)}
<D>__{like diamonds, huh? i never get over it. when i was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.like i could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into a necklace for myself. she'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, i don't know, it was like she really believed it.}

<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{jack, walking home, turns a corner and suddenly stops. across the street, talking to a man, is susie. she says a few words to the man, then touches him lightly on the arm and begins to walk away. jack watches her retreat, then follows, moving quicker as he draws close. as he reaches her, he gently touches her elbow and she turns. not susie. the woman stares at jack, startled. for a moment, he doesn't move. finally, he lets go of her elbow.}

<D>__{this must be it. i will see when we're on.}

<D>__{that's what he'd do.}
<A>__{jack stops, his back to frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you've found the perfect solution to all the pain in the world, haven't you, little brother? eight fifty a bottle, available any time day or night at your friendly neighborhood liquor store. you're weak, jack. just like he was.}
<A>__{jack turns, tough and dangerous in the darkness.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{stay off it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, let's stay on it. i'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. for christ sake, jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig. he left a wife and two sons. he wasn't a hero. he was a fool.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(eerily cold)}
<D>__{you weren't there.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's right. i wasn't there. i don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(coiled)}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, fuck you. and fuck him too. fuck the both of you.}
<A>__{jack suddenly bolts for,ward and grabs frank by the lapels.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey, what're you doing? hey!}
<A>__{jack flings frank against the wall, pounding, pulling and slamming him in a fitful rage.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing; scared)}
<D>__{jack! ... jack! ...}
<A>__{frank slides to the ground, afraid, trying to protect himself. jack hovers over him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how's it feel to have your little brother beat the shit out of you? huh? huh!}
<A>__{jack comes down with a vicious fist at frank's face. frank holds up his hands, trying to shield himself, and catches a blow on his fingers.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{my hands! my hands!}
<A>__{jack grabs one of frank's hands.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(mocking)}
<D>__{your hands. your hands couldn't take the blue ribbon on amateur night.}
<A>__{jack bends back frank's fingers.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{jack!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{who's weak now, big brother?}
<A>__{jack pushes frank's fingers until the knuckles crack.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jack! jack!}
<A>__{frank's voice echoes high above the sound of the rain. suddenly jack stops. looking at frank's hand, still clasped in his, he seems as shocked by his own behavior as frank. letting go, he steps back awkwardly and looks at his brother, beaten, to the ground, his tuxedo ripped and dirty. he stares at his own hands, the knuckles split and bleeding. he no longer looks dangerous. he looks hollow, frightened.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm through with it. i can't do it anymore.}
<A>__{frank, rubbing his fingers, glances up at jack, but jack just turns away, leaving frank on the sidewalk, and disappears into the rain. music begins. a sad, plaintive solo piano. and we see:}
<B>__{series of shots}
<A>__{jack, crossing the street to his apartment, the rain over now. frank, driving home, his face swollen and bruised in the dim glow of the streetlights. jack, letting himself into his apartment and standing there. alone. frank, easing the car into the driveway, turning off the engine. jack, taking a bottle from the kitchen, moving numbly. frank, much later, still sitting in the driveway as the sun begins to come up. jack, sitting in the phone booth, the bottle in his hand.}
<L>__{interior jack's apartment day}
<A>__{the next morning. jack is sitting on the windowsill, watching the rain drum the glass. he glances at the phone across the room, takes another look at the rain, then goes to the phone. he picks it up hesitantly, then dials. it rings. again. again.}
<C>__{cindy }
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{jack blinks. it's cindy.}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{hello ... hellooooo ...}
<P>__{(fainter)}
<D>__{daddy. daddy! someone's on the phone and they won't talk.}
<A>__{jack sets the phone back down on the cradle.}
<L>__{interior bar}
<A>__{jack stands in a dark bar. it is early morning and the light from the street gives the room a ghostly atmosphere. a big, beefy man with a bar towel hooked in his belt is talking to jack.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{if they wanna talk about their wife, you listen. if they wanna talk about their job, you listen. if they wanna talk about their parakeet, you listen. that's it, six nights a week, nine to one or until i send you home. okay?}
<A>__{jack nods and points to the piano in the corner.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that it?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{how many you need?}
<A>__{jack walks over to the giano and strikes a note.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's out of tune.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{trust me, the way i fix a martini, it'll be in tune.}
<A>__{the music returns, sad and plaintive, and we see:}
<L>__{interior frank's house}
<A>__{frank, attempting to give piano lessons to a brother and sister tandem who would be better served by an obedience school. while the little girl pounds incessantly on the piano, her brother runs circles around the room, destroying everything in sight. music continues and we see:}
<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{jack and eddie, going for a walk, passing the diner where jack and frank's pictures are still displayed. music continues and we see:}
<L>__{interior bar}
<A>__{jack, in the bar, playing the music we've been hearing throughout the previous scenes. it is after midnight and the tables are empty. only a few somber men remain at the bar. they do not appear to be music lovers. as jack finishes, he takes a cloth and wipes the keys. there is a glass on the piano with money in it.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{i thought the bakers didn't take tips.}
<A>__{jack glances up, but he knows the voice.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i give it all to charity.}
<A>__{susie nods.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{saw the sign outside. got your own sign, huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah. got my own sign.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{so ... ?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we outgrew each other.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{yeah, well, like i said, it didn't figure. you two.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you don't pick your brother.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so how's the cat food business?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{terrific. i'm doing vegetables next week.}
<A>__{jack nods.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what kind?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{vegetables.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{oh. carrots. and peas. none of the important ones.}
<A>__{susie tries a smile. takes a breath.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{listen... you want to get a drink? i got a new place. or we could go to a bar ...}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{well, maybe not a bar. but i know a place uptown, if you want }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i've given it up.}
<A>__{susie stops.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{no kidding? well ... i guess you can't do a reunion over tomato juice, can you?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{anyway, if you're ever in the neighborhood ... i wrote it down.}
<A>__{susie takes a slip of paper from her purse and hands it to jack. they lock eyes for a moment.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{tell egghead i said hi. if you see him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{if i see him.}
<A>__{susie nods and walks toward the door.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey.}
<P>__{(as she stops)}
<D>__{you got pretty eyes.}
<A>__{susie smiles. as she leaves, jack studies the slip of paper in his hand, then drops it in the tip glass. he glances at the door, swinging slowly shut in susie's wake, then reaches into his coat and takes out a bottle.}
<L>__{interior frank's den}
<A>__{frank sits alone in the darkness of the den. the cardboard stand up is there, along with several old photographs, including one showing two skinny kids in tuxes standing with a glamorous peggy lee. after a moment, donna enters.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{frank? it's late, honey.}
<A>__{frank stays staring at the photograph of peggy lee.}
<C>__{donna}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{mrs. lerner called after dinner. robbie can't make his lesson tomorrow.}
<A>__{donna waits for her husband to say something, then sees the photograph in his hand.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you know how good he is? it's like breathing with him. i've always envied it. but tonight, looking at all this at his face i don't know. maybe it's worse. for him.}
<P>__{(gesturing to the piano)}
<D>__{it's funny. when i sit here and play ... nothing. but when i was up there with him... it was like i had the gift, too.}
<L>__{interior frank's house hallway next day}
<A>__{frank is standing in the hallway of his house, leaning against the bathroom door. it's locked.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{come on, jeremy. open the door.}
<A>__{somewhere in the house, the phone rings. frank ignores it.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{jeremy. you want me to call your father? he's not going to be very happy when he hears he's spending fifteen dollars an hour for you to sit on the toilet.}
<A>__{donna, looking shaken, steps into the hallway.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{honey ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you believe this? the kid won't come out. i'm playing 'camptown races' for him and the next thing i know he's locked himself in the bathroom. there's nothing sharp in there, is there?}

<D>__{honey ...}
<C>__{frank}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{donna. where is she?}
<A>__{donna just shakes her head.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{we tried the apartment, but after that we didn't know where to call.}
<A>__{jack looks frozen.}
<C>__{donna}
<P>__{(continuing)}

<D>__{jack ...}
<L>__{exterior street}

<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{well, this is some surprise.}

<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{jack?}
<A>__{jack looks up.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you want to come in?}

<C>__{susie}
<D>__{i used to do that.}
<A>__{jack turns. susie is looking at him.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sneak out in the morning. before the guy could wake up and ruin it. never figured i'd be on the other end of it, though.}

<C>__{susie}
<D>__{okay.}
<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{jack is standing across the street from his mother's house, just looking. after a moment, he crosses the street. as he moves up the drive, he takes notice of the tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it, kneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there cat's claws running vertically up the tree, the damage smoothed and widened by time. he runs his fingers over the imperfection, then stands and walks toward the house.}
<L>__{exterior house}
<A>__{through the screen door, jack can hear a clicking sound and see partially into the front door. half the room is cast in shadow, the other in blinding light. he opens the door and enters.}
<L>__{interior house}
<A>__{inside, the movie projector is running, the tail of a completed flip slapping like a whip against the carriage. jack turns off the projector and the room falls entirely into shadow. for a moment, the house is silent, full of ghosts, then, gradually, a noise is heard coming from the kitchen.}
<L>__{interior kitchen}
<A>__{as jack comes into the kitchen, he finds frank searching through a cabinet. he watches for a moment.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what're you looking for?}
<A>__{frank turns quickly, surprised.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i didn't hear you come in.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what're you doing?}
<C>__{frank}
<A>__{oh ... i was just hoping for something to drink. but it seems the old lady was dry. not even a bottle of cooking sherry. jack nods. frank looks nervous.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{uh, we already boxed some things. i figured you'd want to go through dad's stuff. it's in there. if you want to get started.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{later.}
<A>__{frank nods. silence.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{is everything done? the arrangements, i mean.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh. yeah. it was all worked out before, you know. she and dad had taken care of it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{right.}

<D>__{yeah, fine.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{there's not going to be a viewing. i figured with the kids and all ...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{jack glances around the room. pictures on the walls. handmade curtains, lightly faded.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's funny. before, whenever i came here, the house seemed small. but today ... i can't keep up with it. i keep losing my wind.}
<A>__{frank smiles slightly and he and jack lock eyes for a moment.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing;glancing away)}
<D>__{god, i could use a drink.}
<A>__{jack hesitates, then pulls a bottle out of his coat.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{oh. well, great. i will get a couple glasses.}
<A>__{frank moves to a cabinet, but there's nothing there.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{damn. donna must've packed them up this morning.}
<A>__{jack holds out the bottle.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(showing the seal is unbroken)}
<D>__{bought it on the way over. clean as a nun.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, it's not that. i ... can't drink from the bottle. i ... gag.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, yeah, right. i forgot.}
<A>__{frank looks embarrassed.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{oh, hey, i want to show you something. come on.}
<A>__{jack follows frank back into the front room. frank stands before one of the tiny matching pianos and gestures jack to the other.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hit the c. go ahead.}
<A>__{jack steps over to the other piano and taps, then frank does the same. jack glances up in surprise.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm right, aren't i? they're in tune.}
<A>__{jack hits the note again and nods in amazement.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{all these years. she kept them in tune. can you imagine? now why would she do something like that?}
<A>__{frank looks down at the keys and his smile fades. suddenly he notices the collection of tiny souvenir shot glasses on top of the piano, each bearing the name of a different hotel.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey, what do you know. looks like we can have that drink after all.}
<P>__{(picking up a few glasses)}
<D>__{what's your pleasure? we got the downtown ramada. we got the travelodge on route 41. and ... the mallory.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will take the mallory.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{good choice.}
<A>__{frank blows some dust off the glasses.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{looks like these got a few years on them.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this'll kill 'em.}
<A>__{jack pours and he and frank settle on the tiny piano benches. as frank swallows, he winces.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{it suddenly grows silent, each sitting in his old familiar place, staring into his glass.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how're your hands?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{oh. fine. it was nothing. couple sore knuckles. nothing.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you know, that night, i ... it just all came up.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, i know. me, too.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i mean, you can play. you're okay.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i can keep the beat.}
<A>__{jack smiles slightly, then both go back to their glasses.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{charlie called.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah. larry shelton. blackie. couple others. donna said even lloyd called the other day. nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{jack and frank lock eyes again. frank's glance drops to jack's glass.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jesus, when was the last time we played the mallory?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{five years ago.}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{november.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{right. it was someone's birthday. halloran?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{daughter's. sweet sixteen.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{christ, that's right. how could i forget. what a nightmare.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she asked for it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i told halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:}
<C>__{jack and frank}
<P>__{(in unison)}
<D>__{what my sissy wants, my sissy gets.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she got it all right.}
<A>__{jack and frank glance at one another, little boy mischief glowing in their faces. suddenly they swivel on the pianos and begin to play "you're sixteen."}
<C>__{jack and frank}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{she comes on like a dream peaches and cream lips like strawberry wine she's sixteen, she's beautiful and she's mine. ribbons and curls ooh, what a girl eyes that sparkle and shine you're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine.}
<A>__{as jack and frank finish, they're laughing. after a moment, their voices die and the house is quiet again. full of ghosts. each stares at the tiny keyboard before him, awkward with the intimacy of the moment. it is quiet for a very long time. finally, frank looks over.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well ... one more time?}
<A>__{jack glances up and sees frank has his empty glass held out. he hesitates, then picks up the bottle.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{one more time.}
