<L>__{exterior bones' building continuous}
<A>__{across the street, shotgun sees the boys in the doorway. then, as a nearly dead vapor light suddenly flickers and comes to life, the shadows created on bones' building make it look almost like a demonic face. gulping for air, laughing hysterically at their survival, the frat boys pause. jason sits back on his butt, checking his wound. the doorway behind them just a black hole in space.}
<C>__{palmer}
<P>__{(bumping fists together)}
<D>__{damn, bro. that was close!}
<B>__{then suddenly}
<A>__{something it happens so fast we're not sure just what grabs sucks pulls palmer back into the black doorway hole. jason, still prone, tries to crawl away but whatever got his friend now sucks him in too. his fingernails scraping along the stoop in frenzied desperation.}
<B>__{with shotgun}
<A>__{when he hears the boys pitiful screams and whimpers from across the street, he leaps to his feet and tries to see into the dark of the doorway across the street. but he can only hear what is happening to the unlucky frat fellas: moans and the sound of flesh torn, and swallowed, and their last dying screams.}
<B>__{up and down the block}
<A>__{the screaming reverberates. faces appear in some windows. while in others, shades are drawn and the lights go out...}
<B>__{back with shotgun}
<A>__{mumbling to himself:}
<C>__{shotgun}
<D>__{"for outside are dogs and sorcerers..." revelation 22, vs. 15.}
<A>__{tears welling in his eyes that he angrily flicks away.}
<B>__{looking at the building}
<A>__{it still has the shadowy look shape of jimmy bones, now shifting again as the vapor light on the street sputters out again, plunging the street into near darkness. the body of palmer no longer visible below. when he looks back, the building seems just an old building again. then there's movement in an upper window, catching his eye. shotgun sees the tall, shadowy silhouette. the figure is elongated, can't tell if it is a man, or the distorted shadow of a man. it beckons to shotgun.}
<B>__{shotgun}
<A>__{just tightens his grip on his rifle and speaks as if the shadowy thing across the street could hear him.}
<C>__{shotgun }
<D>__{you still mad? still want me? come on and get me.}
<B>__{the shadow}
<A>__{shakes its head. as if it can hear him. and again mutely beckons to him.}
<B>__{on shotgun}
<C>__{shotgun }
<D>__{oh, right. you can't. you're trapped there. well ain't that too bad. ain't that just too damn bad.}
