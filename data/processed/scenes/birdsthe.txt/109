<D>__{i think they'll be all right, honey.}
<A>__{there is hope on their faces as the car streaks into the wind. not a wild exuberance, but a relaxation of tension. they stare ahead through the windshield, and then they squint their eyes against the sudden sunrise ahead, and mitch reaches up to turn down the sun visor.}
