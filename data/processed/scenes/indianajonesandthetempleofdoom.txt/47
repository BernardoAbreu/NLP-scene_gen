<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{it's just superstition, shorty. like a ghost story.}
<A>__{short round looks plenty scared as they all stop walking. the shaman motions and the men with torches circle around a pile of rocks to illuminate them. the shaman makes a gesture of devotion to the primitive shrine and indy speaks to the village chieftain.}

<D>__{was the stone very smooth?}

<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{but why would the maharajah take this sacred stone?}
<C>__{shaman}
<D>__{they say we must pray to their evil god. we say we will not.}

<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(translating)}
<D>__{and then they took their children.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{their children?}
<A>__{she looks at short round and finally understands the sorrowful faces always watching him. indy asks another question in hindi and the shaman continues his story }
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(translating)}
<D>__{he says one night there was a fire in the fields. the men went to fight it. when they came back, they heard the women crying in the darkness. and the children were gone.}
