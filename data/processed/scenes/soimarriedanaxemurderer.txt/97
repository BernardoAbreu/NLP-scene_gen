<L>__{interior charlie's hotel room night}
<A>__{a beautiful suite, with a fireplace burning a big stack of wood, with another stack next to it, with an axe in it. music is playing softly on the stereo. and charlie and harriet have just finished making love underneath the covers, illuminated just by the light of the fireplace.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{this is the best honeymoon i could ever imagine, harriet. if we had to pack and go home right now, i'd still think it was the greatest honeymoon ever.}
<A>__{harriet doesn't respond. her head is turned from his.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{don't you agree, harriet? harriet?}
<A>__{he pulls the sheets away from her face to see that she is crying.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(wiping her tears)}
<D>__{what? what are you crying? what is it?}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{it's nothing. it's just... i was just thinking... we're married now. and i always wanted to try and have kids, and...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{so do i. look, there's nothing more i'd like to do than have, kids, or...}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{it's just, i get scared that certain things will happen, or...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what are you talking about? you're gonna be a great mom. i know you will.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{it's not that, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what then?}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{you're gonna laugh.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{tell me. of course i'm not gonna laugh. kids is a big thing. it's hard. i'm sure i have the same fears.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{if we have kids, charlie, things happen. kids are healthy and fine, and some aren't, and i don't know if i could live with myself if i gave birth to a child with webbed feet.}
<A>__{charlie stops to think about this. webbed feet?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{webbed feet?}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{you're laughing.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, i'm not laughing.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{you think that's silly?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, no. that's a natural fear. i've thought about that fear.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{it really worries me, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(quite confused)}
<D>__{well, look, they have, doctors i assume that deal, only with, webbed feet. and, god forbid, and i'm talking strictly hypothetically, should that happen, we'll find one.}
<C>__{harriet}
<P>__{(kissing him; happy now)}
<D>__{you're the greatest charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(confused, to say the least)}
<D>__{thanks. we should get ready for dinner.}
