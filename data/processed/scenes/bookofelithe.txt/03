<A>__{eli continues down the road. he ambles along slowly, a man in no hurry. a man who has been walking a long time. the road has since emerged from the forest. passing now through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk. the sun beats down from directly overhead. the sky has no color to it, paper white. the unfiltered sun's stark light leaves everything seeming bleached out, over exposed. crane up as eli walks on. on the horizon is the silhouette of a city. or what was once a city. columns of black smoke rise from within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. burned and broken skyscrapers jut out like tombstones. eli reaches a fork in the road and stops. the road he's on appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on the horizon. the other fork continues on into the wasteland. after a brief pause, eli changes direction and heads off down the other fork, away from the city.}
