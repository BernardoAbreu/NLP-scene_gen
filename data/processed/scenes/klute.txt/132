<L>__{interior bree's apartment day}
<A>__{a downshot to underpants (as if from klute's pov, connecting directly to the previous shot) then a flashbulb goes off and a hand and pair of tongs enter frame and flip the garment into a collecting box and we widen to reveal that it's now daylight and the scene has been invaded by police technicians. one is a photographer; another, a fingerprint man, is spraying surfaces with a can of fixative. in the foreground klute and trask are talking with ross, the fbi man. ross is looking through a dossier on cable that klute has compiled. over the following conversation we show closeups of material in the dossier. it contains photographs of cable and his life from childhood to the present including pictures of him with his mother and father she a very dominant looking lady and he a very passive looking man; also graduation pictures and pictures with his former wife taken when he was still a very young man. they are the personal images of a life time.}
<C>__{ross}
<P>__{(to klute)}
<D>__{but if cable killed grunemann why would he get you hired to look for grunemann?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{because he knew i couldn't leave the case alone. and this way at least he'd keep track of it. and me.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{what about grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?}
<C>__{trask}
<D>__{cable's letters, cable's phone calls. cable's everything else. he's been a dumper a long time. he just passed off his own peculiar habits on the other man it kept things goin'.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{ok, pretend i believe you. tell me how you get an indictment.}
<C>__{trask}
<D>__{can't. yet. oh we got everythin' else: first rate evidence cable typed those dumper letters to bree daniel. and jane mckenna: klute found a couple in her personal remains. we got dates of cable's trips here coincidin' with phone calls to bree daniel, also the dates of death of mckenna and page. we got some hints of his personal history. his father, unsuccessful salesman, committed suicide when he was 13. his mother pinned all her hopes on her son. he won a national science youth award at the age of eight. they had no money, but she hired special tutors for him in the summer time. she saw a good thing. he graduated from high school at 14 college at 16 no friends the kids in his class thought of him as a freak. he got his ph.d. at 18 married at age 21 to his then employer's daughter. the marriage lasted 4 weeks. her father had it annulled. she says he was impotent. world war ii he got in bad trouble about a german girl, no details. we think we know why he killed grunemann he found out cable was a dumper; cable couldn't take that. we think we know why he killed mckenna she wanted to blackmail him for it. all fine. but we got no body, no direct witnesses, we can't go any damn where.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{that's the reason i told him we had no evidence tom was still alive. we wanted to shake him into another phone call or another letter. it didn't work out just that way.}
<A>__{the technicians, meanwhile have packed to depart. the first technician scoops the torn up photographs into another collecting box. trask retrieves the company outing photograph.}
<C>__{trask}
<D>__{gov, want to leave me that one. how come he got to play with this one, anyway.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{i left them here. i was doing some work here.}
<A>__{trask eyes klute for a moment, as if a querying his relationship with bree. klute is clearly unresponsive. trask resumes.}
<C>__{trask}
<D>__{it's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on cable here.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{nobody's seen that.}
<C>__{trask}
<D>__{if we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. and just think all he really had to do was write us a letter.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{sounds to me you better shake him again. put him in a spot he has to do something more but this time give him a time and a place to do it.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{he called this morning from tuscarora. asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. he's on his way to chicago.}
<C>__{trask}
<D>__{he sure chalks up a lot of flight time.}
<A>__{klute starts gathering his papers we cut to : }
