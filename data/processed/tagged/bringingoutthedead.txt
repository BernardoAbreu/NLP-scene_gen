<A>__{an ems "bus" careens around a corner, tires squealing, lights flashing, siren whoop whooping, swooping through stygian canyons of new york. frank pierce, 28, drives. he wears dark cargo pants, black boots, a white shirt with the paramedic badge, "ems" gold logo on one collar, "olm" on the other. "our lady of mercy paramedic" is inscribed in white across the back of his navy jacket. on his belt: two way radio, leather gloves, beeper, drug kit, multi purpose tool kit, mini flashlight, collapsible baton. larry, 35, overweight, his partner for the night, rides techie (shotgun), both hands clutching the dash. frank scans the blurring cityscape for hidden danger. he is a young man of slight frame and open face his life, his possible futures, still before him: behind those open eyes, beneath those dark shadows: hollowness beckons. dispatcher's voice crackles through the cab static: "ladder}

<C>__{frank }
<D>__{in the last year i had come to believe in such things as spirits leaving the body and not wanting to be put back, spirits angry at the awkward places death had left them. i understood how crazy it was to think this way, but i was convinced if i turned around, i'd see old man burke standing at the window, watching, waiting for us to finish.}

"september of my years" plays from the other room. frank continues massaging mr. burke's chest (now to sinatra beat), even though it's hopeless. larry returns:}
