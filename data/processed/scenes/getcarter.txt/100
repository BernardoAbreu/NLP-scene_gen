<L>__{interior glenda's apartment day}
<A>__{carter is sitting up on the mattress, amused by the soft porn unfolding on the white wall in front of him. the schoolgirl accepts the lift and the car drives off. the door to an anonymous apartment opens and margaret comes in with the girl. her school hat still hides her identity. glenda is there to greet them. the girl is very awkward. glenda tries to make her relax, sitting her down and showing her a magazine. glenda brings her into a bedroom. she takes her own top off and goes to do the same with the girl. she takes her hat off. a close up shows that it is doreen. carter tenses but never flinches from what's happening in the film. margaret comes into the bedroom and feigns shock at what she sees. she slaps glenda and they start fighting, eventually rolling off the bed. the apartment door opens and a man smoking a big cigar comes in. carter sits up. it's albert swift. albert opens another door, looking for someone. he leaves. another door opens and he's in the bedroom. he sees the two women fighting on the floor, but on the bed is his prize doreen. carter watches. doreen bites her nails and looks terrified. reflected in the mirror behind carter is the image of albert taking off his trousers. the reel runs out and flaps like a fish. carter doesn't move. tears form in his eyes. he looks old and defeated. his is a wasted life. then the anger that drives him explodes again and he throws back the bedclothes.}
