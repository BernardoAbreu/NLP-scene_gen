<C>__{galvin}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{...page 414, 'if a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' is that what happened to deborah ann kaye? she aspirated into her mask?}
<C>__{dr. towler}
<D>__{she threw up in her mask, yes. but she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.}
<C>__{galvin}

<D>__{and why, please tell us, would you think that?}
<C>__{kathy}
