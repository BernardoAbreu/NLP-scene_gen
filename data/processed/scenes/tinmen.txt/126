<A>__{he opens the door, flips on the lights and looks around. he races upstairs and starts rifling through the closet and drawers, pulling out nora's clothes her dresses, skirts, blouses, and coats and he opens the window wide and throws them out. he screams as he tosses underwear and the rest of her clothes.}

<A>__{he grabs nora's shoes and throws them out onto the street. then he goes into the bathroom and piles all of her toiletries in his arms, tosses them into a trash can. takes a suitcase from a shelf in the bedroom, opens it, throws in the trash can. he clears out her underwear drawers and empties them into the suitcase, closes the suitcase and then throws that out of the window. he's out of breath, exhausted and sweating. he goes down stairs into the kitchen to get himself a drink. he sees a pair of nora's slippers under the kitchen table, he picks them up, opens the back door and tosses them outside. locks the door. he stands there as if a motor is running inside of him. walks out of the kitchen.}
