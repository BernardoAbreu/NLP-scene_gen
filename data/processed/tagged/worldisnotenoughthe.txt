<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{do you know what you're doing?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{like riding a bike.}
<L>__{interior air tanks, submarine continuous}
<A>__{the air tanks immediately filling with water.}
<L>__{interior tank controls room, submarine continuous}
<A>__{christmas and bond shift to the side. everything not screwed down starts sliding...}
<L>__{exterior submarine continuous long shot}
<A>__{the submarine is tilting, further and further, the nose dropping down and down... pretty soon we have the strange and incredible sight of a submarine hanging vertically, nose down.}
<L>__{interior reactor chamber, submarine continuous}
<A>__{renard hangs on, swings, until he can get a footing on the nearest wall.}
<L>__{interior tank controls room, submarine continuous}
<A>__{bond and christmas hang on too, get a grip. he helps her up.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{what kind of bikes did you ride?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{just wanted to put him on edge...}
<L>__{interior reactor chamber, submarine continuous}
<A>__{renard is disturbed by the sub's position, but only momentarily. he moves to an intercom:}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{open the torpedo tubes.}
<L>__{interior torpedo room continuous}
<A>__{bond hears a creak, turns to see the tubes open water gushes up toward them at an incredible rate.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{climb!}
<A>__{he pulls christmas up and they ascend to the next level. no chance to seal the chamber though, the water is already through the hatch.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{keep moving.}
<L>__{interior reactor chamber continuous}
<A>__{renard now struggles back up to the reactor, stares into the violet blue heat... he hits a button. a rod slowly rises out of the reactor.}
<L>__{interior lower submarine continuous}
<A>__{bond and christmas are ahead of the water. they have reached a level where various systems are operated from.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{there's one chance.}
<A>__{he punches buttons.}
<L>__{exterior submarine, bosphorus continuous}
<A>__{high up on the sub, a hatch opens. water floods into an escape hatch. an inner door stops it getting into the submarine itself.}
<L>__{interior reactor chamber continuous}
<A>__{renard slowly inserts the plutonium rod. immediately the light around him becomes a deeper blue, a horrible luminescence. the staccato click of a distant geiger counter intensifies.}
<L>__{interior submarine continuous}
<A>__{as bond opens the inner door of an escape hatch, he points out a cabinet on the wall to christmas.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{re breathers.}
<A>__{she opens the box to find the re breathers are ripped to shreds. no one was ever meant to get off the sub. she shows bond.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{never liked those things anyway.}
<A>__{he climbs into the escape chamber.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{count to twenty. when you get to twenty open the hatch. it can only be opened for a few seconds or we'll sink.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{but what if...}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{count to twenty. i will be there.}
<A>__{she moves over and seals the door, wrenches a lever which immediately floods the chamber with water.}
<L>__{interior escape hatch continuous}

<L>__{interior submarine continuous}
<A>__{a green light comes on and christmas punches a button...}
<L>__{exterior submarine, escape hatch continuous}
<A>__{the outer door opens... bond burst out and starts the long swim up the outside of the submarine...}

<A>__{christmas is counting.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{one, one thousand, two, one thousand...}
<L>__{exterior submarine underwater}
<A>__{it's dark out here. it would be very easy for bond to get disoriented. he peers around, trying to get his bearings against the vast vertical whale he's swimming up. passes the conning tower.}
<L>__{interior submarine}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{fourteen, one thousand, fifteen, one thousand...}
<L>__{exterior submarine underwater}
<A>__{bond is running out of air... and then he sees it the open hatch of the rear escape door. he gets inside, yanks it closed...}
<L>__{interior submarine continuous}
<A>__{christmas, shivering in the rising water.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{twenty.}
<A>__{she presses a button...}
<L>__{interior chamber beyond (now above) reactor continuous}

<L>__{interior reactor chamber continuous}
<A>__{bathed in the horrible light of the over heating reactor, renard looks upwards, aware of sounds on the other side of the door... ker blam! a blinding flash of light. the door shoots off its hinge, blasted by bond. bond drops down into the chamber, takes one look at renard, now a crumpled heap in the corner. bond moves down to the next door, opens it:}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{christmas!}
<A>__{and there she is, struggling, the water level way below still rising... he lowers an arm, pulls her up. they clamber up to the reactor:}
<L>__{interior reactor chamber}
<A>__{bond's pov: in the intense glow inside the overheating rod, protruding slightly.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{we have to get the rod out of the reactor!}
<L>__{interior reactor chamber}
<A>__{bond looks at the gauges from behind a thick glass shield. christmas comes up level with him:}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{melting down. 4000 degrees, the zirconium casings on the rods crack. 5000, the plutonium melts. in ten minutes, a hydrogen explosion.}
<A>__{the temperature gauge reads 4500 and rising... he starts toward the reactor when suddenly renard is behind bond, throttling him. christmas grabs at him, is flung back, nearly falls through the hatch but manages to grab a pipe, hangs on for dear life. the gauge hits 4700}
<B>__{bond and renard}
<A>__{struggle... both slamming into switches and buttons.}
<T>__{cut to:}

<L>__{interior submarine continuous}
<A>__{the gauge is passing 4900, edging towards the no way back}
<L>__{5000 mark. meltdown imminent...}
<A>__{he looks down the sub more water racing upward... back to the pile. scans the scene, searching for an idea. sees a hose, compressed air escaping from a fissure. thinks fast. grabs the hose, snaps it free...}
<B>__{renard}
<A>__{is recovering, has found a flare gun near him. raises it to bond... bond's pov in the reflection of the gauge (which is millimeters from}
<L>__{5000), we see renard approaching from behind us...}
<A>__{bond jams the hose into the reactor, ducks down as the air blows the rod out narrowly missing him as it shoots past impales renard in the heart, just before he could shoot. renard stares at bond in horror. bond calmly takes the flare gun off him.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{she's waiting for you.}
<A>__{and he lets him fall past christmas, through consecutive open hatches of the sub, crashing into the rising water. christmas looks down at the floating corpse. bond watches the gauge as it edges down from 5000. the nuclear disaster looks like it's averted. but suddenly water is gushing in from above, through splits in the sub's shell; it's going to sink.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{we're sinking.}
<A>__{but she won't come. as water courses over them:}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{help me. we have to seal it.}
<A>__{she moves to the reactor, closing the cover. bond uses his strength to push the heavy locking mechanism into place. bond climbs upwards, dragging christmas with him.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{we've got to get out.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{we can't.}

<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{he must be nearby.}

<D>__{where?}
