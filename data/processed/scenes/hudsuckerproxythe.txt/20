<A>__{new york skyline day in the skyline we can see the hudsucker building topped by the hudsucker clock. a cigar enters frame in the f.g., then the face of the man smoking it. staring contemplatively at the hudsucker building, he takes a puff from the cigar and then plucks it from his mouth and waves it, as if painting a headline.}

<D>__{and not one of you mugs has given me a story on him!!}
<B>__{reverse}
<A>__{shows the editors glassed in office filled with reporters for the staff meeting. although they listen quietly, they are more bored than attentive. through the glass walls we can see the furious activity of an army of reporters, editors, and copy boys waging the never ending battle to put out a quality daily newspaper. the editor slams a newspaper down onto his desk in disgust.}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{facts, figures, charts! they never sold a newspaper! i read this morning's edition of the argus and let me tell you something: i'd wrap a fish in it! i'd use it as kindling! hell, i'd even train my poodle with it if he wasn't a french poodle and more partial to the pages of paree soir! but i sure wouldn't shell out a hard earned nickel to read the dadblamed thing!}

<C>__{editor}
<D>__{yeah, and if a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his ass a hoppin'! i don't want excuses, i want results!}
<A>__{whack! without even looking in its direction, the editor has slammed down the lid of the cigar box on his desk, towards which one reporter's hand had been idly reaching. the reporter jerks his fingers away as the editor spares the briefest moment to glare at him.}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{i wanna know what makes the idea man tick! where is he from? where is he going? i wanna know everything about this guy! has he got a girl? has he got parents? reporter #3 everybody has parents.}

<D>__{uhhh...}
<C>__{reporter next to him}
<D>__{still waters run deep, chief.}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{the only thing that runs deep with parkinson is the holes in his ears. yes, the idea man! what're his hopes and dreams, his desires and aspirations? does he think all the time or does he set aside a certain portion of the day? how tall is he and what's his shoe size? where does he sleep and what does he eat for breakfast? does he put jam on his toast or doesn't he put jam on his toast, and if not why not and since when?}
<A>__{he thrust his face into that of the reporter.}
<C>__{editor}
