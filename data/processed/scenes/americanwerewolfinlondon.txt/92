<L>__{exterior brick lane night}
<A>__{the bombed out ruins of this unsavory part of london are stark and uninviting in the moonlight. three old derelicts are huddled around a trash can fire trying to keep warm. a skinny dog is tied up beside them. its ears perk up and he growls in warning.}
<D>__{derelict #1 old winston smells something. derelict #2}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{who's there?}
<A>__{the dog begins to whine.}
<D>__{derelict #2 let `im go.}
<A>__{derelict #1 unties winston who takes off running in terror.}
<D>__{derelict #3 brave dog that. derelict #1}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{here who's there?}
<A>__{an unearthly howl shatters the night. we've heard this sound on the moors.}
<D>__{derelict #2 that's not winston. derelict #3 look there.}
<A>__{he points out into the night. they strain their eyes something is approaching them. they can just make out its size.}
<D>__{derelict #1 mother mary of god.}
