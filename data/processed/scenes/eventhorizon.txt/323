<A>__{the ship howls as air rushes out, ripping weir off his feet. weir catches himself in the broken window, trying to pull himself back in... a monitor tears free, smashes into him. he is sucked out. miller pulls himself through the door as it begins to shut. he is safe...}

<D>__{don't leave me!}
<A>__{miller turns. starck clings to a console, barely able to resist the winds that try to suck her into the void.}

<D>__{please... help, help me...}
<A>__{miller hesitates, looking from starck back into the safety of the ship. the door continues to shut. in seconds, he will be safe. and she will be dead. miller yells and rips a compressor from its mount, wedges it in the door to keep it open. he keeps one hand on the door, reaches the other hand to starck.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{give me your hand! your hand!}
<A>__{she does. frost forms on their bodies as the air cools. their veins begin to bulge, blood pulses from their noses. he yells with exertion... ...drags her to the door... through the door... ...as the compressor tears free, sucked into space... ...and the door snaps shut, missing them by a fraction.}
