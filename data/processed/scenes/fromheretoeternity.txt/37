<L>__{interior kitchen holmes house day}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{the kitchen is small and undistinguished. karen takes a whisky bottle from a cabinet, pours a straight, stiff drink, puts it on the sink. warden puts the papers down and drinks. karen sits on a high kitchen stool.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're taking an awful chance, you know. my maid is liable to be home any time.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{no she won't. thursday's her day off.}
<A>__{he takes off his raincoat, drops it on a chair.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you think of everything, don't you, sergeant?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i try. in my position you have to.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(goes to sink, picks up the papers)}
<D>__{are these really important?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{yes. but not important they get signed today. tomorrow's okay.}
<A>__{karen suddenly, deliberately, rips the papers in half. then she tears them into bits and throws them into the wastebasket. warden appreciates the gesture, relaxes for the first time. he grins widely.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i got carbons of those back at the office. so it won't be much work to fix them up.}
<A>__{warden's control has begun to affect karen's now. she is losing her poise.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{that's what i like about you, sergeant. you have confidence. it's also what i dislike about you.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{it's not confidence. it's honesty.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{honesty? how did you acquire such an old fashioned virtue?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i figgered out one day it was the shortest distance between two points.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{well, he's clever as well as virile.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{no it's just that i hate to see a beautiful woman goin all to waste.}
<A>__{he moves close to karen, is on the verge of embracing her. greatly tempted but greatly disturbed, she turns away. during next she pours herself a drink, the bottle shaking in her hand. her tone is no longer brittle. it is bitter.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{waste, did you say? now that's a subject i might tell you something about. there's we. and then there's waste. positive and negative. the negative is sometimes more interesting... more evil. for example what about the house without a child? tell me your thoughts, sergeant.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{you're going to cry.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{not if i can help it.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{please don't cry... i can't stand to see somebody cry.}
<A>__{karen turns to face him as he picks up his raincoat, is about to put it on.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i'm leaving. isn't that what you want?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{i don't know, sergeant. to be honest, i don't know.}
<A>__{they stare squarely at each other, both puzzled and a little afraid of their emotions. this is something neither had counted on.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i know a beach near diamond head. nobody ever goes there. the cars on the highway pass above and they never know it's there. you feel like you used to feel when you were a kid, hiding by yourself in a cave, watching the others hunting you.}
<A>__{karen turns, goes to the sink, puts the whisky bottle back in the cabinet.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{maybe... why not?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{how about payday?}
<A>__{karen is trying hard to regain her glassy composure. she is unsmiling again.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you don't have to spend money on me, sergeant.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i just like to have some on me when i take out a woman. can you get away?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{warden grins as he puts on his raincoat. he goes to the door to the pantry, pauses there.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i will be in kuhio park. say, nine o'clock. payday.}
<A>__{karen leans back against the sink, watches him go out to the pantry. a moment later the sound of the door is heard as he leaves the house. she turns on the faucet, starts to rinse, the glasses they have used. suddenly she turns the faucet on full force, watches it pound into the sink.}
