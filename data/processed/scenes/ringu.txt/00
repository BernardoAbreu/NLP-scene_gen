<L>__{interior ouishi household tomokos room night}
<A>__{closeup on a television set. theres a baseball game on, but the sound is turned completely down. camera pans to show two cute high school girls, masami and tomoko. masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee table, textbook in front of her. tomoko is at her desk. there are snacks all over the room, and its obvious there hasnt been much studying going on. masami is currently in mid story, speaking excitedly.}
<C>__{masami}
<D>__{they say that some elementary school kid spent the night with his parents at a bed and breakfast in izu. the kid wanted to go out and play with everybody, right, but he didnt want to miss the program he always used to watch back in tokyo, so he records it on the vcr in their room. but of course the stations in izu are different from the ones in tokyo. in izu, it was just an empty channel, so he shouldve recorded nothing but static. but when the kid gets back to his house and watches the tape, all of a sudden this woman comes on the screen and says }
<A>__{masami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that tomoko actually jumps in her seat.}
<C>__{masami }
<D>__{one week from now, you will die.}
<A>__{short silence as masami pauses, relishing the moment.}
<C>__{masami }
<D>__{of course the kids completely freaked, and he stops the video. just then the phone rings, and when he picks it up a voice says }
<A>__{her voice drops voice almost to a whisper.}
<C>__{masami }
<D>__{you watched it, didnt you? that same time, exactly one week later... hes dead!}
<A>__{masami laughs loudly, thoroughly enjoying her own performance. tomoko, however, is completely silent. she begins looking more and more distressed, until finally masami notices.}
<C>__{masami}
<D>__{what is it, tomoko?}
<A>__{tomoko comes out of her chair and drops onto the floor next to her friend. her words are quick, earnest.}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{who did you hear that story from?}
<C>__{masami}
<D>__{who? its just a rumor. everybody knows it.}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{youko told you?}
<C>__{masami}
<D>__{no, it wasnt youko...}
<A>__{tomoko looks away, worried. masami slaps her on the knee, laughing.}
<C>__{masami}
<D>__{whats up with you?}
<A>__{tomoko speaks slowly, still looking away.}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{the other day, i... i watched this strange video.}

<D>__{where?}

<D>__{so thats what ive been hearing about you doing some double date sleepover thing! so, you and that guy iwata, huh?}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{no, its not like that. nothing happened!}
<A>__{their eyes meet and tomoko half blushes, looks away again. her expression becomes serious as she resumes her conversation.}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{iwata... he found this weird video. everyone was like, whats that? so he put it on and we all watched it.}
<C>__{masami}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{and? what kind of video was it?}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{just... weird, i cant really explain it. anyway, right after we finished watching it, the phone rang. whoever it was didnt say anything, but still...}
<A>__{silence. masami curls up on herself, thoroughly spooked.}
<C>__{masami}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{it's cuz, you know, we'd all heard the rumors.}
<A>__{tomoko looks seriously over at her friend.}
<C>__{tomoko }
<D>__{that was one week ago today.}
<A>__{there is a long, heavy silence as neither of them says anything.}
<C>__{masami}
<D>__{waaait a minute. are you faking me out?}
<A>__{tomokos face suddenly breaks into a smile.}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{busted, huh?}
<A>__{they both crack up laughing.}
<C>__{masami}
<D>__{oh, my... i cant believe you!}
<A>__{masami reaches out, slaps her friend on the knee.}
<C>__{masami }
<D>__{youre terrible!}

<D>__{gotcha!}
<C>__{masami}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{but hang on... you really stayed the night with youko and iwata, right?}
<A>__{tomoko nods, uh huh. masami dives forward, pinching her friends cheeks and grinning wildly.}
<C>__{masami}
<D>__{so, how far did you and he get?}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{oh... i cant remember.}
<C>__{masami}
<D>__{you cant remember, huh?}
<A>__{masami laughs, then slaps tomoko on the knee again as she remembers the trick her friend played on her.}
<C>__{masami}
<D>__{man, you had me freaked me out. i }
<A>__{just at that moment, the phone rings. they are both suddenly, instantly serious. tomokos eyes go off in one direction and she begins shaking her head, no . masami looks over her shoulder, following her friends gaze. tomoko is looking at the clock, which currently reads 9:40. the phone continues to ring. tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her friend, looking panicked.}
<C>__{masami}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{was it true?}
<A>__{tomoko nods her head, still holding on tightly. masami has to forcibly disengage herself in order to stand. the phone is downstairs, so masami opens the bedroom door and races down the stairs. tomoko calls out to her from behind.}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{masami!}
