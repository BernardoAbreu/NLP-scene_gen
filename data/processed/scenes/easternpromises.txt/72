<D>__{the choral music continues as we see the old man opening his case and pulling out tattooing equipment. nikolai is sitting in a banquette at the back, wearing only his underpants. we circle nikolai as the tattooist begins to work on his knees, preparing nikolai's knee caps for the tattoos. the needle bites at nikolai's skin as the old tattooist wipes away the blood. then we see the needle working on the empty spaces above nikolai's heart, tattooing the star symbol. nikolai now has a star tattoo on each knee and two eight pointed stars on his chest. he is now a member of the vory v zakone.}
