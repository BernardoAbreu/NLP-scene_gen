<L>__{interior office ceramics studio n night}
<A>__{it's crammed with file cabinets. sketches for pottery pieces are taped to the walls along with photos of mr. brooks, jane and emma. mr. brooks, clad only in a t shirt and underwear, is sitting in front of a computer. marshall, dressed as he usually is, is in a chair at his side. they are both staring at the monitor where on one side of the screen is detective atwood's police id photo, on the other side of the screen, mr. brooks is scrolling through her personnel file.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{.... huh... her father's gerald atwood, why does that ring a bell?}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{someone you did business with, someone we killed?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{not someone we killed... mba... college of william and mary... she's been a cop for eleven years... married doctor carlson, divorced dr. carlson, married jesse vialo... restaurateur... separated from jesse vialo, sued for support by jesse vialo, seeing a shrink because of jesse vialo...}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{excellent fitness report though.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{she caught the hangman, the guy that escaped the other day...}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{oooh... she's caught a lot of people... and look here, this isn't the first time she's been hunting for us.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i wonder what the deal was with her and jesse vialo?}
<A>__{mr. brooks taps a key that minimizes atwood's file then drags it to the right hand corner. in the middle of a key stroke it hits him:}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{ahhhh... now i remember. her father, gerald atwood, never did business with him but emma and i met him a couple times, big political fundraiser. he owns or owned one of the largest insurance groups in the country and a lot of other stuff.}
<A>__{tap, tap, tap. jesse vialo's driver's license comes up.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{jesse vialo... good looking, a little younger than she is.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{younger, restaurateur...}
<P>__{(snorts)}
<D>__{she married him on the rebound from the doctor and i will bet he married her for her money and her connections.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{the old man being rich doesn't mean she's rich. maybe he's one of those guys who would rather give it to the opera than to his kids.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{wouldn't she have to declare any outside income and holdings to the police?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{hmmm...}
<A>__{he restores atwood's file. tap, tap, tap, tap. stop. the men study the screen then look at each other.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{the opera didn't get much.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{why would a woman with her education and worth 60 plus million dollars and probably more to come, want to be a cop?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i like that about her.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{you're such a fucking snob, earl. you like her because she's rich.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{no, i like her because she found something that's hers. it's not the family business. and she's good at it. i'd like jane to find something that's hers and that she could be good at.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{that's exactly why atwood scares the shit out of me. she's a cop who doesn't need the money and she's looking for us. that's one fucking dangerous human being.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{the fact that you're not wrong doesn't make me admire her any less.}
