<L>__{interior needy's house 8:45 a.m.}
<A>__{needy is standing in a small, dingy bathroom, trying on different configurations of clothing.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{"wear something cool" meant something very specific in jennifer speak. it meant i couldn't look like a nerd, but i couldn't upstage her either. i could expose my stomach, but never cleavage. tits were her trademark.}
<A>__{needy wiggles her jeans a bit lower, exposing her childishly round tummy. she walks out of the bathroom into her bedroom, a frilly pink hell complete with canopy bed. chip dove is sitting on the bed, looking lost in all that pink. he raises an eyebrow at needy's abdomen.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{those jeans are hella low. i can almost see your front butt.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{chip, it's a rock show. this is my rock look.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{i can see, like, your womb.}
<A>__{needy sighs and hoists up her pants.}
<C>__{chip }
<D>__{why are you blowing me off for some dumb concert, anyway? we were supposed to have movie night. i even rented orca. it's like jaws, except with a harmless whale.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{jennifer needs me. she really wants to go see this band. it's extremely important to her.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{i've never even heard of soft shoulder. which one is jennifer stalking?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{the lead singer, of course. girls like her don't go out with drummers.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{thanks a lot!}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{no offense. i mean, she'd probably make an exception for a drummer who was also the lead singer.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{like phil collins.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{who's phil collins?}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{forget it. he's seminal, but whatever...}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{anyway, this singer guy is like 22, so he could get locked up in the state pen if he actually dated her. but jennifer says he's extra salty, so...}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{salty. you guys ever going to stop using that secret language?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{"salty" means beautiful.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{then you must be soy sauce, babe.}
<A>__{needy and chip start making out. chip unbuckles his belt eagerly even though they've barely begun. needy stops.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{jennifer's here.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<A>__{needy shrugs. a beat of silence. then we hear the door swing open. jennifer's voice floats up from downstairs.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{needy, quit tampooning yourself and get down here!}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{that's fucking weird.}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(straightening her clothes)}
<D>__{i'd better hurry.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{you always do what jennifer tells you to do.}
<A>__{needy pulls her necklace out from beneath her shirt and flashes a heart shaped "b.f.f." charm at chip.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{she's my best friend, chip. remember? this necklace is no joke.}
<A>__{chip sighs, resigned. they head downstairs.}
