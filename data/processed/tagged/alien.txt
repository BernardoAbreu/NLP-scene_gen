<L>__{interior hypersleep vault}
<A>__{a stainless steel room with no windows, the walls packed with instrumentation. the lights are dim and the air is frigid. occupying most of the floor space are rows of horizontal freezer compartments, looking for all the world like meat lockers. foom! foom! foom! with explosions of escaping gas, the lids on the freezers pop open. slowly, groggily, six nude men sit up.}

<D>__{play it for us, please.}
<A>__{over the speakers, we hear a hum, a crackle, static... then a strange, unearthly voice fills the room, speaking an alien language. the bizarre voice speaks a long sentence, then falls silent. the men all stare at each other in amazement.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{computer, what language was that?}
<C>__{computer}
<D>__{unknown.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{unknown! what do you mean?}

<P>__{(glares around the room)}
<D>__{computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?}
<C>__{computer}
<D>__{yes. there are two points of salient interest. number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin. number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{well, it's finally happened.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{first contact...}

<D>__{i've got it. it's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination 39 degrees 2 seconds.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{dell show me that on a screen.}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{i will give it to you on number four.}
<A>__{broussard punches buttons. one of the viewscreens flickers, and a small dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen.}
<C>__{broussard }
<D>__{that's it. let me straighten it out.}
<A>__{he twists a knob, moving the image on the screen till the dot is in the center.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{can you get it a little closer?}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{that's what i'm going to do.}
<A>__{he hits a button. the screen flashes and a planet appears.}

<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{i don't know. seems to me we came on this trip to make some credit, not to go off on some kind of side trip.}
<C>__{broussard}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{forget the credit; what we have here is a chance to be the first men}
<A>__{to}
<D>__{contact a nonhuman intelligence .}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{if there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{hell, we're equipped }
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{hell, no! we don't know what's down there on that piece of rock! it might be dangerous! what we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{except it will take 75 years to get a reply back. don't forget how far we are from the colonies, martin.}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{there are no commercial lanes out here. face it, we're out of range.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe. this is an opportunity which may never come again.}

<C>__{standard}
<D>__{dell, i want greater magnification. more surface detail. i want to see what this place looks like.}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{i will see what i can do.}
<A>__{he jabs his controls. the image on the screen zooms down toward the planet; but all detail quickly vanishes into a featureless grey haze.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{it's out of focus.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{no that's atmosphere. cloud layer.}
<C>__{melkonis}

<D>__{what's the terrain down there?}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{well, line of sight is impossible due to dust. radar gives me noise. sonar gives me noise. infrared noise. let's try ultraviolet. there. flat. it's totally flat. a plain.}

<C>__{standard}
<D>__{help me, come on, let's get him up here.}

<D>__{medical gloves.}
<A>__{they pull thin elastic gloves from a dispenser in the wall, and pull them on. gingerly, they approach broussard. standard places his hands on the octopus thing that is slowly pulsing on broussard's face. he grasps the tentacles in his hands and tries to pull it free.}

<D>__{he went into the pyramid alone. we lost radio contact with him. when we pulled him out, it was on his face. it won't come off, not without injuring him.}

<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{yeah, but how? his nose and mouth are blocked.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{let's look inside his head.}

<B>__{torso.}
<A>__{the parasite is clearly visible on broussard's face. in x ray, the creature is a maze of complicated biology. but the shocking thing is that, in x ray, we can see that broussard's jaws are forced wide open, and the parasite has extruded some kind of long tube, which is stuffed}
<L>__{into his mouth and down his throat, ending near his stomach.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{look at that.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{what is it i can't tell anything }

<C>__{roby}
<D>__{i think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{it doesn't make any sense. it paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.}

<D>__{we can't expect to understand a life form like this. we're out of our back yard. things are different here.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{well, can't we kill it? i mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{we don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it. at least right now it's keeping him alive.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{how about cutting it off? we can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{you're right... we can't stand here and do nothing.}
<A>__{standard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head. then he pulls back on his bulky gloves. finally, he presses a switch and broussard slides back out of the booth.}
<C>__{standard }
<P>__{(muffled in his mask)}
<D>__{somebody give me a scalpel.}
<A>__{melkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall, and carefully passes it to standard. clumsily because of the gloves, standard manipulates the knife in his hand till he has a decent grip on it. then he flicks a little button with his thumb. the scalpel begins to hum. standard advances on the parasite. the others draw back nervously. roby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack, and holds it inconspicuously at his side. standard bends over the parasite. carefully, he touches the scalpel to the extreme end of one of the tentacles, where it curves toward the back of broussard's head. effortlessly, the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue. immediately, a urine like fluid begins to flow from the wound.}

<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{i've made an incision... it's not reacting... but some kind of yellowish fluid is leaking out of the wound...}

<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{hold it, this stuff's smoking!}
<A>__{the others react nervously. by now, the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and has dripped down onto the floor below. the metal floor begins to bubble and sizzle, and more smoke rises. the men start to cough.}

<D>__{god, that smoke's poisonous!}
<C>__{hunter}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{it's eating a hole in the floor!}
<A>__{abruptly, the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in the corridor outside, coughing their lungs out. standard, who is masked, remains. frantically, he attempts to put a bandage on the wound, but the fluid instantly melts the bandage, and in the process, some of the stuff gets on standard's gloves. they begin to smoke. frantically standard leaps back, pulling off the smouldering gloves. then he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask.}

<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{it's within 4 meters.}
<A>__{roby and melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand. faust, prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of approaching the source of the signal. he moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker. the tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one wall. behind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down faust's face as he sets down the tracker and reaches for the little door. he raises the prod, grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod inside. with a nerve shattering squall, a small creature comes flying out of the cabinet, eyes glaring, claws flashing. instinctively, they throw the net over it, but:}

<C>__{standard}
<D>__{i guess we open the door and net it.}

<D>__{well we better do something.}

<D>__{don't be an idiot.}

<C>__{standard}
<D>__{once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more we can go straight into hypersleep. also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.}

<D>__{somebody gimme a hand, i will get the stuff.}
<L>__{interior corridor outside food locker later}

<A>__{they pull on gas masks.}

<C>__{standard}
<D>__{go ahead, jay.}
<A>__{faust turns on the machine. it begins to throb as it pumps the gas through the hose and into the room. immediately, the crashing noises rise in crescendo, and the thing can}

<C>__{standard }
<D>__{shut it off.}
<A>__{faust shuts off the pump.}

<D>__{what do you think? now we go in.}
<A>__{standard steps to the door and opens it. a thick cloud of gas billows out.}
<L>__{interior food storage room}

<D>__{god damn it.}
<A>__{they all look where he is pointing. in the wall, a ventilator grill}
<B>__{has been ripped open.}
<C>__{hunter }
<D>__{it escaped.}
<A>__{they move to the shredded ventilator and shine their lights into it.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{where does that go?}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{all over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{then let's go and do it.}
<A>__{they head for the door.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{have we got any food at all left in the ship?}

<D>__{ and the cooling unit on the other.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{so it's trapped in between now we have to drive it out.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{poison gas...}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{we can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit! it'll flood the whole ship!}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{the only other thing i can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{are you crazy ?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{the man would need protection, obviously as well as some way to drive the thing before him.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{how about a flamethrower? that wouldn't poison the air.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{so one of us goes into the airshaft and drives the thing along }
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{while the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{sounds like a rough one.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{got a better idea?}
<A>__{hunter shrugs.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{so the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{let's be democratic.}
<A>__{he tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console. on one of them, he draws a large x. then he wads each piece of paper into a tiny little ball. he rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the table like dice.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{martin, take one.}
<A>__{roby picks one up and unfolds it. it is blank. melkonis picks up another and opens it. again blank. faust picks up a ball, and standard immediately picks his own up. they are both blank. they all look at hunter, who has not yet unfolded his.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{open it up, cleave.}
<L>__{interior food storage room}
<A>__{hunter is strapping on an oxygen mask and a flame thrower. faust is helping him. finally, faust hands him a tracking device.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{well, uh... good luck. i hope you won't need me, but if you do, i'm here.}
<C>__{hunter}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{hunter turns and climbs into the ventilator opening, which is just large enough to crawl through.}
<L>__{interior air shaft}

<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{hey, do you guys read me down there?}
<L>__{interior climate control room}
<A>__{standard, melkonis and roby are spreading out the net. we hear the hum of huge cooling plants, and their hair ruffles. large airshafts run off in different directions.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{yeah, we're getting into position.}
<L>__{interior air shaft}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{okay, i'm starting now.}
<A>__{he begins to crawl forward into the narrow metal tunnel. he turns a corner. after a couple more tight turns, the tracker suddenly beeps. hunter twitches. he raises his flamethrower and fires a blast into the darkness. it roars loudly in the confined tube, and the air instantly heats up. smoke drifts back into his face. he begins to sweat.}
<L>__{interior climate control room}
<A>__{roby points to a large rectangular opening in one wall.}
<C>__{roby}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{there. that's where it's got to come out.}
<A>__{he throws a switch, and a large metal panel rises and seals off the opening.}
<C>__{roby }
<D>__{that's a flip flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{right now let's keep it closed.}
<A>__{melkonis is setting up a little portable unit with a screen on it. the screen shows a section of the ship's schematic.}

<A>__{they lift the net up, holding it in front of the opening.}
<L>__{interior air shaft}
<A>__{hunter is still crawling on hands and knees. up ahead, he can see that the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn. he crawls toward the down angle, then fires another blast from his flamethrower. then he starts crawling down, head first. when he is nearly upside down, the shaft takes yet another turning which puts him into a nearly impossible position, almost immobilized. then the tracker starts beeping like crazy. frantically, he fumbles the flamethrower around, but the space is narrow it is difficult maneuvering. he hears a hissing cry up ahead, and claws scrambling on metal. then he has the weapon into position, and sprays another lethal flaming burst toward the sound.}
<L>__{interior climate control room}
<A>__{melkonis is staring at his screen.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{they're getting pretty close now.}

<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(to roby)}

<L>__{interior climate control room}

<A>__{melkonis reaches over and throws the switch. the metal gate drops down, opening up the shaft. a six foot monstrosity stands in the opening. ghastly beyond imagination, squamous, covered with tentacles, it hops down like an over sized bird and grabs melkonis in razor sharp tentacles. melkonis lets out a horrible shriek, and the thing grabs his head in one claw and twists it off like a man pulling the head off a chicken,}
<B>__{then throws it to the floor with an audible clunk .}
<A>__{clutching melkonis' body tightly against itself, it turns and bounds down the hall. melkonis' headless body is still kicking and struggling as the monster leaps head first into another air shaft. standard and roby are left standing in shock. after a moment, hunter climbs out of the shaft.}

<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{recognizable! in that?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{in symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{well... i suppose that star shaped thing could be the parasite that got on broussard. is that what you mean?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{and right next to it, that oval design with the markings it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.}
<C>__{standard}

<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{... and broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{you will notice, though, that there are no more phases. only four forms are shown. after that the pattern repeats.}
