<L>__{int harvard college natatorium dawn}
<A>__{the bottom of a swimming pool. a lithe figure slashes like a knife through the water, doing laps. the swimmer is the only one in the pool, but still pushes like he's got someone to beat. his strokes echo off vacant bleachers in an oldish college natatorium. as he reaches the end of the pool, he sees a murky figure through the water. the swimmer stops, pulls off his goggles. robert langdon is fiftyish, but looks ten years younger, must have something to do with two hundred laps at dawn every day. claudio vincenzo is heavier, dressed in a sport jacket and slacks, looks exhausted. he speaks with an italian accent.}

<A>__{he heads for the locker room. vincenzo calls after him.}
<C>__{vincenzo}
<D>__{they said to show you this.}
<A>__{langdon turns back. vincenzo's holding a single sheet of paper in his right hand. langdon, curious, makes his way back to him. takes the paper and, it is safe to say, feels the earth give way beneath his feet. he looks up, eyes wide, and mutters a single word:}
