<D>__{depend on it, there is some artifice. when once you get into that wicked town, you are not safe. there are scores of writs out against you for debt. if you are taken in london, and thrown into prison, your case is hopeless.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{mother dear, we are now living off our own beef and mutton. we have to watch lady cosgrove within and the bailiffs without. there are certain situations in which people cannot dictate their own terms; and faith, we are so pressed now for money, that i would sign a bond with old nick himself, if he would provide a good round sum. with this money, we can settle our principal debts and make a fresh start.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{roderick, you must listen to me. as soon as they have you in london, they will get the better of my poor innocent lad; and the first thing that i shall hear of you will be that you are in trouble. you will be a victim of your own generous and confiding nature.}
