<D>__{yussef and ahmed are sitting against the wall of the house. yussef's lip is split. ahmed's nose is bleeding. abdullah paces desperately, while his wife and daughters watch the scene, silent. abdullah stops to look at yussef.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{why did you do this? they don't answer. abdullah leans over and slaps ahmed.}
<C>__{abdullah }

<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{we were testing the rifle. abdullah turns and gives yussef a powerful slap, which he endures with silent dignity.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{are you idiots? you killed a woman,}
<P>__{(he turns to zora)}
<D>__{and you, you got naked so your brother would see you?}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{yes, she got naked lots of times. i saw how yussef spied on her.}
<C>__{zora}
<D>__{that's not true. abdullah turns to yussef.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{is it true or not? yussef is silent. abdullah walks two steps forward and slaps zora. he looks furious, scared, indignant.}
<C>__{abdullah }
<D>__{why did you do this to us? he can barely hold in his tears. zora brings her hand to her face tearily. abdullah turns to ahmed.}
<C>__{abdullah }
