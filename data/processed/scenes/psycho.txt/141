<L>__{interior downstairs hall of sheriff's house (night)}
<A>__{fat roses splatter the wallpaper. the stairs are carpeted. the lighting is bright. there is a perfectly fitting wall phone by the parlor arch. mrs. chambers goes to the stairway, yells up.}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<D>__{albert!}
<P>__{(a tiny wait, a smile as sam and lila enter)}
<D>__{al chambers!}
<A>__{sam is about to close the door behind him. mrs. chambers motions for him not to, scurries across the hall, leans outside, presses the doorbell. the ring within the house is even more shattering. she closes the door, starts to the stairway, pauses as the sounds of movement above come over}
<B>__{shot.}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<D>__{customers!}
<A>__{sheriff chambers comes down the stairs, in a bathrobe which matches his wife's. he is a tall, narrow man with a face originally destined for mount rushmore. he nods at sam, looks at him with wide awake eyes and a no nonsense concern.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we have a problem.}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<P>__{(to lila)}
<D>__{let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{no, thank you. it's my problem, too.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't know where to start...}
<P>__{(a look at lila)}
<D>__{except at the beginning.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to sheriff)}
<D>__{this is lila crane, from phoenix. she's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. there's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced mary...}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<D>__{mary is lila's sister?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes. he traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<P>__{(to the sheriff)}
<D>__{bates' motel.}
<P>__{(to lila)}
<D>__{he has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... go on, sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he traced her there and called us to say he was going to question mrs. bates...}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<P>__{(a pleasant shock)}
<D>__{norman took a wife?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no. an old woman, his mother.}
<P>__{(to sheriff, quickly)}
<D>__{that was early this evening. and we haven't seen or heard from him since. i went out to the motel, just got back. no one was in the office, and...}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(interrupting, anxiously)}
<D>__{will you help us? i think something's wrong out there!}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{(after a considerate pause)}
<D>__{now. your sister is missing how long?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{she left phoenix a week ago yesterday. and no trace until...}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{how'd you and this detective come to trace her to fairvale?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{they thought she'd be coming to me.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{left phoenix under her own steam?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{she ain't missing so much as she's run away.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{from what?}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(a look at sam, then:)}
<D>__{she stole some money.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{a lot?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{forty thousand dollars.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{and the police haven't been able to...}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{explains the private detective. he traced her to the bates place. what'd he exactly say when he called you?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{mary had been there, one night, and had left.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{with the forty thousand dollars?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{he didn't mention the money.}
<P>__{(anxiously)}
<D>__{what he said on the phone isn't important, is it? he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! that's what i want you to do something about!}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{go out there! find somebody, ask some questions!}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{i'm sorry if i seem over anxious to you. i keep thinking... something's wrong. i have to know what!}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{i think something's wrong, too, miss. but not the same thing. i think your private detective is what's wrong.}
<P>__{(as lila is about to object)}
<D>__{i think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from norman bates... and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{he said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<P>__{(to sheriff)}
<D>__{why don't you call norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, albert.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{at this hour?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he was out when i was there. if he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{he wasn't out when you were there. he just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. this fellow lives like a hermit...}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<D>__{recluse. kinder word.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{you must remember that bad business out there. about ten years ago...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i've only been here five. right now it feels like ten, but...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{all right! then call! at least, call!}
<A>__{mrs. chambers goes to phone, dials operator.}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{florrie, the sheriff wants you to connect him with the bates motel.}
<A>__{she hands the receiver to the sheriff. he takes it, reluctantly, listens to the dim sound of ringing on the other end. after a moment:}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{norman? sheriff chambers.}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{been just fine, thanks. listen, we got some worries here. did you have a man stop out there tonight...}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. a private detective, name of...}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<D>__{arbogast.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{arbogast.}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{and after he left?}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{no, it's okay, norman. how's it been going out there?}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{well, i think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{please!}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{sorry i got you up, boy. go back to sleep. yeah, be glad to.}
<P>__{(hangs up, turns to mrs. chambers)}
<D>__{said to give you his regards.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(faint irony)}
<D>__{was that all?}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{this detective was out there and norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{and he didn't go back? didn't see the mother?}
<A>__{the sheriff looks long at lila, shakes his head sympathetically.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{you should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. you go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{what difference does that...}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{your detective told you a nakedfaced lie.}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<D>__{barefaced.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{he told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question norman bates' mother, right?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{(a pause, then calmly)}
<D>__{norman bates' mother has been dead and buried in greenlawn cemetery for the last ten years!}
<A>__{there is a long silence. sam and lila stare at the sheriff.}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<D>__{i helped norman pick out the dress she was buried in. periwinkle blue.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{it ain't only local history, sam, it's the only murder and suicide case in fairvale ledgers! mrs. bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself. strychnine. ugly way to die.}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<D>__{norman found them dead together. in bed.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you mean that old woman i saw sittin' in the window wasn't norman bates' mother?}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<P>__{(hopefully, happily)}
<D>__{maybe you saw mary!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'd know the difference between mary and an old woman.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{now wait a minute, sam. you sure you saw an old woman?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes! in the house behind the motel. i pounded and called but she... just ignored me.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{and you want to tell me you saw norman bates' mother.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{it must've been. arbogast said so, too... and he said the young man wouldn't let him see her because she was ill!}
<A>__{the sheriff stares at both of them, and when he finally speaks there is an almost inaudible tone or irony in his voice.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{well, if the woman up there is mrs. bates... who's that woman buried out at greenlawn cemetery?}
