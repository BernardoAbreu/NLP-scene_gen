The song is extremely sexy - as is Alyssa who works the mic, making direct eye contact with... Holden.  Or does she!  Holden is smiling, being seduced, Banky rolls his eyes.  Beside Holden, stands a pretty GIRL with a short haircut, who's also riveted by Alyssa's performance. Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out there. The song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at. It's more than obvious there's a seduction going on, bur of whom!  At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but Alyssa's preoccupied.  She points to someone in the crowd, and curls her finger back in a 'c'mere' fashion, urging whoever it is to join her.  She jumps off the stage. Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw- shucks style.  At that moment, the Girl beside him leaps forward.  Banky's eyes widen.  Holden looks up and is suddenly taken aback. Alyssa and the Girl race into each other's arms and fall into a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss. Holden's eyes bug.  Banky allows a smile to creep across his face.  The crowd applauds.  Banky looks around, and for the first time, we get the distinct impression that this is a lesbian bar... There are a lot of chicks in this place.  Gay chicks. Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back.}

I know you think of me as just a friend and crossing that line is the furthest thing from an option you'd ever consider.  But I can't do this any longer.

I can't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are.  I know this will probably queer our friendship - no pun intended - but I had to say it, because I've never felt this before, and I like who I am because of it.  And if bringing it to light means we can't hang out anymore, then that hurts me.  But I couldn't allow another     day to go by without getting it out there, regardless of the outcome, which by the look on your face is to be the inevitable shoot- down.  And I'll accept that But I know some part of you is hesitating for a moment, and if there is a moment of hesitation, that means you feel something too.  All I ask is that you not suppress that - at least for ten minutes - and try to dwell in it before you dismiss it. There isn't another soul on this fucking planet who's ever made me the person I am when I'm with you, and I would risk this friendship for the chance to take it to the next plateau. Because it's there between you and me. You can't deny that.

He opens it, sticks a straw into the top, and begins sipping and sifting through the mail. He comes to mail that's Holden's and tosses it onto the couch, near Holden's head.  He looks down at the sleeping couple, then back at the mail for a couple of beats. Then he freezes.  He looks down again, and drops his jaw and his carton of choco.  It hits the floor with a pop. Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to focus.  They look at one another, then at the flabbergasted Banky.  Banky blinks.

Men and women should be together, it's the natural way - that kind of thing.  I'm not with you because of what family, society, life tried to instill in me from day one.  The way the world is - how seldom you meet that one person who gets you... it's so rare.   My parents didn't really have it.  There was no example set for me in the world of male/female relation ships.  And to cut oneself off from finding that person - to immediately half your options by eliminating the possibility of finding that one person within your own gender... that just seemed stupid. So I didn't.  And by leaving my options open, I was branded 'gay', which to me was no big deal - labels are labels, you know?  They define what you do, not who you are, I guess.
