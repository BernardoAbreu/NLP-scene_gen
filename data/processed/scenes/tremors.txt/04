<L>__{exterior cliffs dawn}
<A>__{the sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge 1000 feet from a ruggedly beautiful high desert plateau. at the top of the cliffs, silhouetted against the dawn, a lone cow boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise. as we move in, we realize he's actually peeing over the cliff. this is valentine mckee (25). smart and good looking, val has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly. he coasts through life, following the path of least resistance which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on the edge of civilization. but lately he's beginning to wonder why he hasn't accomplished more in his 25 years. as a few sleepy cows gaze at him, sleepy val shuffles over to his battered old pickup truck. a hand painted sign on the door reads: "v & e all type's of job's." indeed, the pick up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every conceivable odd job and the noisily snoring form of his partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag. val raps on the side of the truck.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{good morning, mr. bassett, this is your wake up call. please move your fat ass.}
<A>__{no response from the sleeping bag. val stares at the cows chewing their cud and perks up as he gets an idea. he gently steps onto the truck's running board, then suddenly starts jumping up and down as hard as he can, rocking the truck violently.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{stampede! earl, get out of the way!}
<A>__{the sleeping bag tries to get up and run for it. it tumbles out of the back of the pickup. while val laughs uproar iously, earl basset (43) claws his way out of the bag, looks around wildly, and finds himself staring at three motionless cows.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you dumb shit.}
<A>__{earl is a good ol' boy who has lived his life just like val, drifting from job to job. he knows why he hasn't accom plished anything, and often tries to impart his hard won wisdom to val, but the last thing the younger man wants is advice. earl stretches. the men begin a silent ritual: earl gropes through his pockets for a cigarette, but only finds a lighter. meanwhile, val digs in his pockets, coming up with cigarettes, but no lighter. typical of these two, each guy always has half of what he needs. eventually they sort it out, trading the necessary implements. earl reaches for a coffee pot on a battered coleman stove on the tailgate. but it's cold.}

<D>__{you didn't cook breakfast?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{did it yesterday. franks and beans.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(tries to recall)}
<D>__{no...it was eggs. i did eggs.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{hell you did. your turn.}
<A>__{earl raises his fist. this is the challenge, and it instantly triggers the partners' conflict resolution technique. they solve all disputes using the children's game of "scissors, rock, paper." earl raises his fist in response. the game is played swiftly and silently one, two, three. on three, val mimes "paper" (open hand. earl mimes "scissors" (two extended fingers). scissors cuts paper. val has lost. he shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{well, when i'm your age i will probably forget what i eat, too.}
