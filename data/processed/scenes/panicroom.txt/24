<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{ the darkened panic room, where the dozen small video screens all suddenly wink to life, showing a dozen views of the house. whatever she pushed turned these on too, probably not what she meant to do, but at least she got the alarm on for the night. the door that leads from the panic room to the master bedroom hangs open. in the middle of the floor in here, somebody has made a small tent of blankets and couch cushions. sarah must have been playing here before bed.}
