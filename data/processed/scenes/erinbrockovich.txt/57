<A>__{erin's driving away from donna's house. a street lamp throws light on the box of chromium documents in the passenger seat. she gets to an intersection and looks across the street at the massive compressor station. six stories high, lit up like a christmas tree, with all sizes of pipes criss crossing the outside and giant cooling towers sticking up out of it. far more massive than anything else in town, it looms over the horizon like the capitol in d.c. or st. peter's in rome. erin takes a long look at the compressor station, then turns onto community boulevard and drives away.}
