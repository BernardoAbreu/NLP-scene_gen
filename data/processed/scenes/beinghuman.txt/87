<L>__{exterior yard day}
<A>__{hector has retreated to the yard. the girl is boiling some dyes in a cauldron over an open fire. the boy is working at a basketful of flower heads, pulling petals and separating the hearts, putting them in a large jar of colored liquid. hector is aware of beatrice watching him. she is returning to the kitchen, firmly holding a struggling chicken, wings flapping and feathers flying everywhere. this chicken is making the supreme sacrifice in beatrice's final effort at total seduction, a wonderful meal. hector is guiltily aware of this as their eyes meet briefly. hector takes in what the boy is doing and joins in the work. the boy smiles at hector's initial clumsiness. he motions for hector to have a sniff of the jar of liquid. hector does so. the smell is heady and pleasant.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{ah...}
<A>__{the boy says something and points towards his sister. she stands by her cauldron, stirring the bubbling liquid. hector goes to watch her work. he looks in the cauldron.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{good color... for cloth?}
<A>__{without thinking, hector leans over the cauldron to sniff. a hideous odor assaults him. he backs off.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{ugh...}
<A>__{the girl says something to him, and points to a bucket of liquid at her feet. hector makes out something like the word "peepee."}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{peepee?}
<A>__{the girl nods enthusiastically. the boy is sniggering.}
