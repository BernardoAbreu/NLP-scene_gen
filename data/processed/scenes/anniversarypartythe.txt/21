<A>__{judy adams lost herself a little, steps outside, sits alone...}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(smiles over at ryan)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{hi. a little close in there.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{yup.}
<L>__{interior music library continuous}
<A>__{a small, narrow room. not much more than an alcove. with space for a desk, stereo equipment, and shelves packed with cds. the topmost shelf is a line of record albums. joe's picking through the cds. monica wanders in from the living room, toting a glass of champagne... watches him for a moment.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{your eames table is incredible. and the b&b. i just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you're an interior decorator, right?}
<C>__{monica}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{sally did all this herself?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{in fits and starts and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me. so things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic. and it keeps changing.}
<C>__{monica}
<P>__{(somehow at a loss)}
<D>__{mmm. it says something about the two of you maybe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.}
<P>__{(re: champagne)}
<D>__{i see you've moved up from the soft stuff.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{oh, yes. you know ryan's been sober eight years. and it's difficult if i... you know. it's better if i don't.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i'm a little nervous, so...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{a little out of my element.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no you're not.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{well, yes. yes, in fact. a little on the outside, yes. and there's been all this friction.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{hm.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{very well put.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i think a lot of this could have been avoided if sally made more of an effort.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{but you're very private people. you know, there's a kind of elitism...}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{elitism?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{the wrong word, maybe. delete that. and, you know, the dog barks incessantly.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{and you know, he really does not.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{and ryan works at home.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{and your phone calls are nasty and abusive. and i've come this close to suing you for harassment. and you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.}
<A>__{her eyes well with tears.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{oh shit. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{well, that's what ryan thought. i was more generous, actually.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh shit. i'm sorry. i'm a total fucking maniac. delete all that, okay? i spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife. oh shit. i get pissy sometimes. much worse than otis. otis doesn't bite. it's just, i really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. we live in a canyon. we hear dogs barking at night, too. and it's not otis.}
<A>__{monica starts to laugh.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{alright.}
<A>__{it appears she's consumed more than one glass of champagne.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{easy tiger.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{alright. please don't tell ryan i'm drinking.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{scout's honor.}
<C>__{monica}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{i will be your best friend.}
<A>__{she feels they've bonded. she pulls a well thumbed copy of joe's novel from her purse.}
<C>__{monica }
<D>__{would you sign it for me.}
<P>__{(digs for a pen)}
<D>__{i'm sure this is inappropriate.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we're way past inappropriate.}
<A>__{monica giggles, presses back the bubble rising in her chest and moving toward her throat. manages not to burp.}
<C>__{monica}
<P>__{(as he signs it)}
<D>__{i will treasure this.}
<A>__{he moves towards the doorway, monica at his heals.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i need to leave you now.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i will treasure this.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(shouting down the hall)}
<D>__{sally!!!!}
