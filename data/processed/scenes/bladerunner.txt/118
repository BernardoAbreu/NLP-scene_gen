<L>__{interior tenth floor hall night}
<A>__{he's backing deckard out the door. deckard trips and falls. there's fear on his face. the strength is gone. something is starting to crack.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{what's wrong? aren't you a lover of faster, bigger and better?!}
<A>__{deckard's pedaling backwards over the floor.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{it's time to die.}
<A>__{deckard throws the laser at him. it misses. batty throws his head back and laughs. a one eyed colossus about to eat the world. suddenly he stops. his eye moves over the wall.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{ah!}
<A>__{he reaches out and pinches something. his lips compress as he yanks it out of the wall. it's a ten penny nail. he holds it out to deckard and drops it. deckard catches it.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{that's for you.}
<A>__{one side of batty's face smiles savagely.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{stick it in your ear and push. if that doesn't work, try the eye.}
<A>__{deckard stares at the nail in his hand, then up at his executioner.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{believe me, it'll be better for you than what i'm about to do.}
<A>__{batty watches him, hoping the stimulus might inspire his victim to more action. it doesn't look like it.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{deckard springs to his feet and bolts. but instead of going for the stairwell he turns in the first available door.}
