<B>__{computer screen}
<A>__{so close it has no boundaries. a blinking cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath the derma of black neon glass. a phone begins to ring, we hear it as though we were making the call. the cursor continues to throb, relentlessly patient, until }

<C>__{screen}
<D>__{trace program: running.}
<A>__{the entire screen fills with racing columns of numbers. shimmering like green electric rivets, they rush at a 10 digit phone number in the top corner.}
<C>__{cypher }
<D>__{he caught the northbound howard line. got off at sheridan. stopped at 7 11. purchased six pack of beer and a box of captain crunch. returned home.}
<A>__{the area code is identified. the first three numbers suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns. we begin moving toward the screen, closing in as each digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like the wheels of a slot machine.}
<C>__{trinity }
<D>__{all right, you're relieved. use the usual exit.}
<C>__{cypher }
<D>__{do you know when we're going to make contact?}

<C>__{trinity }
<D>__{are you sure this line is clean?}
<C>__{cypher }
<D>__{yeah, course i'm sure.}
<A>__{we move still closer, the electric hum of the green numbers growing into an ominous roar.}
<C>__{trinity }
<D>__{i better go.}
<C>__{cypher }
<D>__{yeah. right. see you on the other side.}
<A>__{she hangs up as we pass through the numbers, entering the netherworld of the computer screen. where gradually the sound of a police radio grows around us.}
<C>__{radio }
