<D>__{we can't keep this baby, kiaya. we must take her to the council.}
<A>__{the children run in and they all huddle together, cher ishing their precious lives.}
<L>__{interior council building day}
<A>__{arguing villagers pack the church shaped room to the open door at the back and into the balconies above. the councilmen sit on a platform at the front, with the high aldwin seated in a special chair above them. tak ing charge, burglekutt stands and pounds the floor with his walking stick.}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{an evil beast from the outer world has invaded our peaceful village, looking for a baby!}
<A>__{this only adds to the frenzy.}
<C>__{a villager}
<D>__{it's a sign! an omen!}
<C>__{another villager}
<D>__{our crops will die!}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{silence! one beast we can kill. but there may be more! and they won't give up their search till they've found what they're looking for!}
<C>__{meegosh}
<D>__{whose baby is it!}
<C>__{other villagers}
<D>__{who's to blame for this!}
<A>__{amid the chaos the high aldwin slowly stands up. as if he senses something, he looks over the crowd toward the back. at the back door, holding the baby, willow tries to push his way through the jostling crowd. the high aldwin raises his hand. it flashes magically. he points as he speaks:}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{willow ufgood! come before me!}
<A>__{the crowd stands apart as willow walks the length of the room. kiaya and the children follow part way and then stand aside next to meegosh. burglekutt simmers as willow approaches the platform.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{earlier today you tried to tell me something, willow.}
<C>__{willow}
<P>__{(bows his head)}
<D>__{my family found this baby in the river, high aldwin.}
<A>__{the crowd stirs but the high aldwin silences them with a simple gesture. he gazes down at the baby mysteri ously.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{a daikini child...}
<P>__{(his eyes close)}
<D>__{...of some importance, i feel...}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{that's what the beasts want! give it back!}
<A>__{the crowd rumbles, many agree.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{they'll kill her! we can't let this baby die!}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{what do we care!}
<A>__{burglekutt whips up the shouting crowd. the high aldwin raises his hands, feeling the air above him. almost in a trance:}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{...importance...yes...this child is special...}
<C>__{councilman}
<D>__{what should we do?}
<A>__{instantly, the high aldwin drops his arms and opens his eyes.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{this child must be taken beyond the boundaries of our village. all the way to the daikini crossroads.}
<A>__{the room goes silent.}
<C>__{a villager}
<D>__{who will do that?}
<C>__{several villagers}
<D>__{vohnkar! vohnkar!}
<A>__{vohnkar the warrior elbows his way to the front and pounds his chest once with his fist.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{the outer world is dangerous and corrupt, vohnkar. and this baby is hunted by blood hungry beasts. are you willing to sacrifice your life?}
<A>__{brave vohnkar swallows and shifts his weight doubtful ly.}
<C>__{vohnkar}
<D>__{if i go, who'll defend you if other beasts attack?}
<A>__{the crowd rumbles and shouts, and vohnkar mops his brow and scuttles away from the platform.}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{he's right! it seems only fair that the man to take this baby to the crossroads...}
<P>__{(walking stick up)}
<D>__{...be the very man who plucked it...}
<P>__{(walking stick down)}
<D>__{...out of the river!}
<A>__{all eyes turn to willow. kiaya gasps and meegosh holds her back.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i can't do it! i haven't put my crop in!}
<C>__{a councilman}
<D>__{you caused this trouble. you found the baby...you get rid of it!}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{i nominate willow ufgood!}
<A>__{the crowd cheers wildly. the high aldwin steps forward to the edge of the platform. with a flourish he waves his arms.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{i will consult the bones!}
<A>__{something rattles as he shakes his cupped hands. the crowd jumps away. the high aldwin scatters small bones across the floor below him. he leans down and studies the bones. willow looks at kiaya, who is worried and afraid. the high aldwin speaks softly to him:}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{the bones tell me nothing.}
<P>__{(he eyes willow)}
<D>__{but i must make a decision. is there love in your heart for this child?}
<A>__{willow hesitates. he looks at the baby.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the high aldwin bolts straight up, broadcasting:}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{the bones have spoken! willow? the security of this village depends on you!}
<A>__{the people shout and cheer and applaud and begin to leave. kiaya and meegosh and the children push their way toward willow, who stands there staring at the baby.}
