<C>__{david}
<D>__{they're not going to listen to me now. let me come round tomorrow. when everyone's calmed down a bit.}

<C>__{david}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{i owe them a lot more than that. i owe them everything. they gave me you.}
<A>__{he opens the boot. it's full of cases of whiskey. jenny doesn't even bother asking what they are doing there. david takes one of the bottles, opens it, takes a long slug.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{two minutes. and then i will come out and drag you in. jenny marches into the house and slams the door. the camera stays on david. he gets back into the car and takes another slug of whiskey. then his shoulders begin to shake, and he cries and cries.}
