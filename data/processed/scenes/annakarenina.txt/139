<A>__{it's time to stop for the day. more tomorrow. the mowers with their scythes walk back across the large meadow of cut swathes. from the other direc tion, a crowd of village women are coming to meet them carrying food and drink.}
<L>__{exterior haymaking (kashin) dusk}
<A>__{a fire has been lit. the mowers eat their meal in the company of women. serafina tends to a cooking pot in the firelight. levin watches her discreetly. he has settled down at a discreet distance from the men. his attention is caught by a grown up boy and his young wife who have chosen to sit slightly apart. he is charmed by them, watching the girl serve her husband. theodore comes to levin with a jug. levin takes a swig.}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{how many mowers is it, theodore?}
<C>__{theodore}
<D>__{forty two, master. in your father's time it was work for two days for thirty men . . .}
<P>__{(slyly)}
<D>__{. . . though he never picked up a scythe himself.}
<C>__{levin}
<A>__{the men don't like me for it.}
<C>__{theodore}
<A>__{they like what they're used to.}
<C>__{levin}
<A>__{it settles me.}
<C>__{theodore}
<A>__{how is that, master?}
<C>__{levin}
<A>__{when i'm mowing, i don't ask myself why i'm here.}
<C>__{theodore}
<A>__{you're here to be master, konstantin dmi trich, to be your father's son, and father to a son who will be master after you, as it has always been by the grace of god.}
<C>__{levin}
<A>__{my father owned you, theodore. my grand father owned your father. owned you like chattels, to be bought and sold. was that by the grace of god?}
<C>__{theodore}
<A>__{it was. those were good times when your father had the keeping of us. that's my youngest you were looking at there. his young life is perilous now since the free dom came and work must be found.}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{it's true i was looking at him.}
<C>__{theodore}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{at his wife too, i dare say.}
<A>__{levin is abashed, found out.}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{they look happier than i've ever been. is it living simply that i'm looking for?}
