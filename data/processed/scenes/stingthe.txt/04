<L>__{interior numbers spot day}
<A>__{suddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering, clamoring people. this is a spot for the numbers racket, a place immune from legal interference, where any sucker can bet on a number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the 600 to 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right. the bettors are queued up in several lines before a long table, where they place their bets and are given receipts in return. others wait at a cashier's window to pick up previous earnings or to ask for credit. mottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting slips are being sorted and money counted under the watchful and somewhat impatient gaze of a supervisor, an older man named mr. granger. the yankee white sox game is heard on the radio in the background. mottola, noticing that his entrance has aroused little interest, saunters over to the phone girl and gives her a little pinch on the cheek. the girl slaps his hand away, obviously having been through this before.}

<D>__{beat it, mottola.}
<A>__{granger glances up and exchanges a token nod with mottola, who plops down in a folding chair next to the radio. the phone rings.}

<D>__{8720...yes, hold on a second.}
<P>__{(calling over to the supervisor)}
<D>__{mr. granger, chicago on the line.}
<A>__{granger is a little apprehensive about talking to chicago, but takes the phone anyway.}
