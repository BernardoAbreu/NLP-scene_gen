<L>__{interior museum classroom day}
<A>__{a modern classroom that has been taken over by the police for the purpose of interrogation. seated on small chairs at a plain table are... henry and larry, looking like two little boys with a story they are desperate to share. standing behind them is mrs. beasley, starchier than ever. d'agosta takes a chair across from the boys, at their eye level. by this time of day he looks pretty rumpled and tired. pendergast stands upright and unruffled in a doorway behind. this isn't hard duty for d'agosta. he's surprisingly genial and at ease with kids. larry kicks his sneaker against the table leg in excitement. henry tugs his t shirt.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{hi. i'm lieutenant d'agosta. you can call me vince. this is special agent pendergast. you can call him...}
<P>__{(he looks to pendergast, so formal)}
<D>__{special agent pendergast.}
<C>__{beasley}
<D>__{this is henry weiss and larry bowers.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{so... tell us about this monster.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{we were lost and trying to find a short cut to the dino }
<A>__{henry elbows him hard. larry shuts up.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{we were just lost, okay? and we went down this curvy staircase. at the bottom was a big shadow.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{big as a house.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{not that big.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{well almost. depends which house. it smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.}
<A>__{henry makes a low growl in his throat. d'agosta suppresses a smile, shoots pendergast a look. but pendergast watches the kids intently.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{and it snuffled the ground like a dog.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{like this.}
<A>__{he goes on hands and knees, sniffs the ground.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{it had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{they were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{they were yellow!}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you're color blind.}
<C>__{beasley}
<D>__{boys, please!}
<P>__{(to d'agosta)}
<D>__{these two get in a lot of mischief and they tell some amazing whoppers.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{i can see that.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{this isn't a whopper! it's the truth.}
<A>__{pendergast now moves forward, pulls up a chair as if deeply interested.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{how did you get away?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{we ran and screamed and stuff. and we got through a little door just in time. there was a guard there and he went back to check.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{a guard? do you remember his name?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{he was wearing one of those i.d. badges. his name was bo... something.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{beauregard?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{yeah.}
