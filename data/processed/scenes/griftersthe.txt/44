<A>__{his head moves slightly. he barely has strength to speak.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{myra?}
<A>__{she moves forward to the side of the bed, only her torso in frame. she touches a hand to his forehead.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{my god!}
<A>__{she turns, hurries back to the living room, looks around for the phone, crosses to it, dials, speaks. roy's eyes open, he frowns.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{lilly?}
