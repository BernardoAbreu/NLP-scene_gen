<L>__{interior mark sutton's office day}
<A>__{eddie stands opposite mark's desk.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{but it takes cash to make cash...}
<A>__{another elegant man is there too, mark's boss, dunham.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{i'd like to re negotiate my advance.}
<C>__{dunham}
<D>__{well... sit down, we'll be discussing that.}
<C>__{mark sutton}
<D>__{first, ah... i want to apologize, eddie, if i in any way communicated a lack of faith in your abilities.}
<A>__{eddie smiles coolly. in control. it's mark who's a little nervous.}
<C>__{mark sutton }
<D>__{mr. dunham has read your pages, and we're prepared to make you what i hope will be a very exciting offer.}
<C>__{dunham}
<D>__{what would you say to ten thousand more and another forty down the road?}
<A>__{eddie holds there gaze, expressionless, but says nothing. after an uncomfortable moment, dunham continues.}
<C>__{dunham }
<D>__{we think this could be an important title, maybe one in a series. i have to say, you came out of nowhere, but the good ones always do }
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(interrupting him)}
<D>__{this isn't going to work.}
<C>__{dunham}
<D>__{what's not going to work? the money?}
<C>__{mark sutton}
<D>__{eddie, we take you very seriously as a writer.}
<A>__{eddie sounds almost regretful.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yes, but i now see that writing, as a profession, is for marginalized whiners not fit for anything else.}
<A>__{sutton thinks eddie's kidding. he laughs nervously.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{no, i mean it, look at the life. incarceration, loneliness, burrowing down into your own psyche, increasingly insulated from any truth, because you're not in the currents of the world any more, you're rattling around inside the cage of your brain, self cannibalizing...}
<A>__{dunham realizes he's losing eddie, and jumps in.}
<C>__{dunham}
<D>__{you don't think a best selling author would disagree?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{oh, if you're good, there's some remuneration, eventually, after paperbacks, but at best your career'll be oozing along like a snail, a few thousand more copies, whoop dee doo, you're "developing a readership," for what? so you can end up in phoenix on a saturday night reading from your own work at some holdout indie book store to a bored audience of ten? half of them there for the wine and cheese?}
<C>__{mark sutton}
<D>__{yes, but if your goal is to have a voice }
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i don't think any goal will be really achievable, mark, until i'm sitting on a large pile of cash.}
<A>__{the mens' mouths open. then shut.}
