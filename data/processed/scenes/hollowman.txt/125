<L>__{interior laboratory day}
<A>__{sebastian holds his latex head on his lap, while eeg leads hang suspended in mid air, outlining his real head. carter analyzes the results.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{when you were a kid, you ever dream about being invisible?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{sure... all the time.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{what did you imagine you'd do?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{the usual.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{what's the usual?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{hanging out in the girl's locker room. kicking jimmy margiani's ass.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{jimmy margiani?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{school asshole. drove a red trans am. back then, i was the size of a small planet and made a rather large target.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{ever think up anything along the grand scale?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{sure. world domination. manipulating stock markets, consolidating a political power base. but those are more recent fantasies.}
<A>__{carter pulls off the electrodes and sebastian slides on his latex facemask.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{and what if it weren't fantasy? what if you were out there in the world and could do whatever you wanted with no consequences whatsoever. how far would go? i mean... if it were real?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{i don't know, man. out in the real world... i mean, there's a responsibility...}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{let's say you saw a woman with amazing tits. would you brush against them?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{hell, i try and do that now.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{human nature. so if you could get away with more, would you do more?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{i read that in a survey at a major university they asked college students "would you steal if you were guaranteed to get away with it?" 82% said yes.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{eighty two percent? makes you wonder if the world's ready for what we're doing.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{so, doc what did you do?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{when you were out.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i just walked around. y'know.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{aw, you just walked around? come on. there's more, right?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{man, i'd be walking up to people saying shit like "this is god, go,get a haircut." or hanging out in the changing room at victoria's secret.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{kind of sophomoric, don't you think. besides, it was late and i wasn't out that long.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{well, did you see anybody?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{there was this one girl.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{yeah? and did you mess with her?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{naw...}
<A>__{sebastian gives carter a sly grin.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{well maybe a little.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i tell you though, a man could get used to it.}
