<L>__{exterior cliffside mexican city day}
<A>__{a car graveyard sitting on top of a 300 foot cliff overlooking a real tough barrio. gravel crunches under the fiat's tires as it drives to the edge of a cliff.}
<C>__{creasy's voice}
<D>__{stop here. turn off the ignition.}
<L>__{interior fiat 500 day}
<A>__{jorge does as he's told. suddenly the sig comes down hard. whack! as jorge's vision explodes...}
<L>__{interior fiat 500 day}
<A>__{still in the driver's seat, jorge wakes. the first thing he sees is that his hands are taped to the steering wheel with his pudgy white fingers exposed. he is naked, reminiscent of the 18 year old in the opening sequence.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{can you hear me?}
<A>__{jorge nods, the pain in his head blinding.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i am going to ask questions. if you don't answer, fully and truthfully, you will suffer much more than you have to.}
<A>__{creasy opens pinta's notebook to a blank page near the end. he clicks open a pen. creasy presses in the car's cigarette lighter. then he opens a buck knife. jorge winces at the sound of the blade locking.}
<C>__{creasy }
<D>__{i'm going to cut your fingers off. one by one. if i have to.}
<A>__{the cigarette lighter pops back out.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{that's to cauterize the stubs.}
<A>__{holy sweet jesus... sweat drips down jorge's forehead. he tries to master his fear. swallows dry.}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{do you know who i am?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{i am the president of la hermanidad.}
<A>__{without warning creasy reaches up with the buck knife, a flash of steel. the big man howls, his left ear suddenly missing, starts an epic struggle, practically breaking the wheel off the steering column. he is like a bucking rhinoceros. he howls as creasy sprays his face with pepper spray.}
