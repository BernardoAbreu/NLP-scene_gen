<A>__{a white uniformed assistant leads a line of african parents, reeking of sadness, into a cool room where metal drawers open from the walls. stanley and julius their black lawyer the two men seem to be very well known, people shake hands with them, salute them gordon and emily's sadness is tinged with anger they have dignity, defiance, bowed with grief as they are. stanley's large hand is placed gently on emily's shoulder as they examine the dead faces before them. they belong to children, some in torn, dirty clothes, others naked, some mutilated, others whole and seemingly unharmed, as if asleep, until the small, neat hole in temple or chest and the small crust of blood is brought to our attention. a woman behind them starts to scream. they look around to see her holding onto a drawer, her legs buckling. another woman pulls her close to grieve with her. the assistant approaches them and after a soft exchange he writes a name on a tag and ties it onto the body. the woman can't, won't leave her dead child. her friend has to pull her away. the crowd parts to let them through. other women reach out to touch her. gordon looks into the last drawer, jonathan is not there. they make their way out past the other parents and a group of mourning women sitting.}
