<L>__{interior the lantern and the lamb restaurant day}
<A>__{the town's upscale dining spot. mumford, delbanco and sheeler are in a red leather booth. sheeler listens with rapt, admiring attention as delbanco speaks }
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{...annihilation anxieties engendered by bad experiences with a depriving mother... but no one can escape the fear of death. it is, as henry james put it, "the worm at the core." try as we may to forget or ignore our mortality, james said }
<P>__{(theatrically)}
<D>__{ "the skull will grin in at the banquet."}
<A>__{mumford nods appreciatively. (he really is an extraordinary listener.) delbanco catches his own vanity in sheeler's adoring gaze and becomes self conscious }
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{i've run on. forgive me. we're here to talk about you.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{are we?}
<C>__{sheeler}
<P>__{(covering)}
<D>__{what ernest means, i think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. we're great believers in learning from each other. i've learned so much from ern dr. delbanco...}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{...and i from phyllis.}
<C>__{sheeler}
<P>__{(back to a previous thread)}
<D>__{so... the university of kentucky. who runs the program down there?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{my mentor was an amazing teacher named benton mandlebaum. died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{i think i've heard of him... a disciple of rothberg, wasn't he?}
<A>__{mumford's response, and all that follow, is calm and pleasant.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{it's possible. i don't know about that.}
<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{i suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{lots of institutions. my graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible prisons, clinics, half way houses. for a while i was chief therapist in a shopping mall. had a little spot next to the yogurt place.}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{interesting approach. what was his name?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{dorothy fowler. fantastic woman. she passed last year in a train wreck. damned amtrak.}
<A>__{delbanco and sheeler exchange a look. sheeler adopts a "casual" tone }
<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{i trained in the east, myself cornell and i don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. i found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... did you?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{oh, yeah, very tough. but i guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.}
<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{which examiner did you have? i probably know him.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{wallace franklin... from greensburg.}
<A>__{a dark look comes over sheeler's face for a moment.}
<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{that was a terrible thing.}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(agrees)}
<D>__{i don't even know why hang gliding is considered a legitimate sport.}
<C>__{delbanco}
<P>__{(back on track)}
<D>__{we're interested in any new therapies. how would you characterize your approach?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{my approach?}
<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{yes... your particular approach.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i don't have one really. most of the time i'm faking it. see, i think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep rooted by the time i hear about them. the most i can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. if i can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, i can help them out a little.}
<A>__{mumford sits back, considering the couple across the table. his gaze is so crystalline that, after a moment, they become uncomfortable and steal a glance at each other. finally }
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{i see.}
