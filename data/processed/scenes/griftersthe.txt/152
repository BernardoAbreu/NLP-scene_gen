<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{lilly switches on the light as she enters the room. she looks around, crosses to the closet, goes through the stuff in there, finds an old attache case on the shelf. she brings it out, puts it on the bed, opens it. inside are a few decks of cards and a paperback book. she tosses them onto the bed, checks the case, finds that one of the clasps works but the other doesn't. one is good enough. she carries the attache case out of the room, leaving the light on.}
