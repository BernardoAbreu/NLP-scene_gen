<L>__{exterior sky night}
<A>__{(scene 1100 ambushed!) hiccup stares ahead, frustrated, as toothless glides over a bed of clouds, glowing in the low, arctic sun. hiccup yells, then slumps back onto the saddle. toothless recoils, sensitive to hiccup's upset. the steam from their breath mixes in the frigid air.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{don't worry, bud. i'm not gonna let anything happen to you. i promise.}
<A>__{toothless' ear plates perk up. he glances over his shoulder to see a disturbance in the blanket of clouds. a strange and arresting masked warrior rises from the clouds, standing upon something unseen. its armor and cape flap in the buffeting turbulence. the warrior eyes toothless and hiccup, pulling up alongside them. hiccup senses the approaching figure in his periphery and sits up, flustered.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{aw, come on, dad! really?!}
<A>__{he whirls around expectantly then freezes, mouth agape. the warrior stares blankly, tilting his head in curiosity while cutting a menacing silhouette. then, just as gradually as he rose, the warrior dips back beneath the clouds, disappearing.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{okay.}
<P>__{(to toothless)}
<D>__{no sudden moves.}
<A>__{suddenly, the warrior explodes out of the clouds before them, standing atop a large dragon. they circle hiccup and toothless, forcing them to tread air. the warrior points a staff toward hiccup, unnervingly, as he returns to face them.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{hold on, hold on.}
<A>__{toothless growls a warning. suddenly, they're ambushed from behind. hiccup is plucked off of toothless by another dragon and carried off.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{toothless!}
<A>__{with the tail unmanned, toothless plummets helplessly. he flaps wildly then crashes through the ice into the black, frigid water. flailing and crying out, he struggles to stay afloat as he watches... hiccup disappear into the night sky, carried off in the talons of the strange dragon one of tens that accompany the warrior in a cavalcade. toothless bellows in distress, desperately trying to take to the air. as he leaps and crashes, time and again... a group of spiny dorsal fins split the ice, carving a path toward toothless. beneath the ice, a pod of seashockers approach, two headed, with manta ray like wings gliding silently in the gloom. fixated on hiccup, toothless is caught by surprise as the seashockers surface and drag him under. hiccup's helmet bobs to the surface, marking all that remains.}
