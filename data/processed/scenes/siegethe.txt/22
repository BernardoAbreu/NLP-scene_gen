<A>__{elise brutally slapped across the face we are in her apartment. samir looms over her.}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{you let him hit me !! you cannot care about me and let such things happen!}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{next time don't be such a smart ass }
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{sometimes i hate you just because you are so american. it makes me want to hurt you. i think about fucking you and hurting you.}
<A>__{elise can taste the blood in her mouth but it's the price she's come to accept. in a heartbeat, it's all business.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{ you want to fuck me? then work with me.}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{don't tell me what i have to do.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{no? do we really want to have this conversation again? do we ?}
<A>__{something quietly ominous in her tone. he lowers his eyes. and like a sailboat, elise changes tack. strokes his arm.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i need you to help me. i need you to be strong. as you have always been strong. for both of us. samir? look at me...}
<A>__{back to hub who awakens in the darkness he's fallen asleep in a chair. in his lap is a pile of visa applications. his beeper goes off. he rouses himself. back to elise roughly turned over in bed by samir sex without any shred of tenderness. as samir kisses the back of her neck, we see in her eyes the thousand yard stare. back to hub on the street in the doorway of an apartment building, frank hands hub a styrofoam cup of coffee. it's a ritual between them. back to elise lying in bed as samir smokes}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{ some people just cannot live in the camps. for my brother, it was already like dying. the only thing he lives for is movies.}
<A>__{he sits up in bed, reaching for another cigarette.}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{ and then some sheik tells him that, to die for allah is beautiful. if he does this thing, our parents will be taken care of, and he will live on in paradise with seventy virgins. seventy.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{and my brother, he needs to believe it very much, so he straps ten sticks of dynamite to his chest and goes to the movies...}
<P>__{(a rueful laugh)}
<D>__{and i become a vip. it is very confusing.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{ so who are you afraid of betraying? you know these people. they bomb, they maim. do they represent the palestine you want to build?}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{they're using you.}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{you are using me, too! everybody uses the palestinians! we are the whores of the middle east!}
<P>__{(looks at her)}
<D>__{you make reports about our little talks ? what about fucking me?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i had to get special permission for that.}
<A>__{as he stands up, naked, and goes to the window, we see:}
<B>__{the same image}
<A>__{seen again, from much farther away by hub who stands on a rooftop across the way, watching through 1050 binoculars. frank stands beside him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{beats cable.}

<D>__{god. duty. honor. country. where on capitol hill, wall street, or hollywood would you find one man who's even paused over one of those words in the last ten years?}
<A>__{hub is unsure why he's audience to such a command performance.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{what, uh, brings you here, general?... can i get you some coffee?}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{you want me to get to the pointerior the president's concerned. he's worried that have you met him by any chance?}

<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{ with all the affection for the man i can tell you he doesn't know fuckall about terrorism, or the mideast, that i don't put on his cue cards. what he's expert in is his own survival. you get my meaning?}

<C>__{hub}
<D>__{i appreciate your support.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{you're sure you're not chasing your own tail, though?}
<A>__{hub considers for a moment, then:}

<D>__{what do you know about sheik ahmed bin talal?}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{old news.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{maybe not. we've received two communications from the bombers to "release him."}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{we can't release him.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{i know our stated policy is not to negotiate with terrorists, but }
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{hub, we can't release him because we don't have him. we never had him. and besides that, he's dead.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{the cia says }
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{the cia? the cia couldn't predict the fall of the berlin wall until bricks were hitting them in the head.}
<P>__{(resuming)}
<D>__{the libyans snatched the sheik some sectarian muslim thing i will explain it next time you have a free week. they killed him. qaddafi put out disinformation that it was us... who was your source on this?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{elise kraft.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{...a woman will never know the middle east. you're talking about a culture that keeps its women slipcovered. elise kraft can't tell a sheik from the prophylactic of the same name.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{i appreciate the heads up.}
<A>__{devereaux rises, offers his hand. as they shake, elise sticks her head in the door without knocking.}
