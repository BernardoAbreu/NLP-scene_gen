<A>__{the judge, a rather sour looking jurist of the old school, calls the court to order.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i want to make one thing very clear before we go any further. the law does not recognize the existence of ghosts, and i don't believe in them either, so i don't want to hear a lot of malarkey about goblins and spooks and demons. we're going to stick to the facts in this case and save the ghost stories for the kiddies. understood?}
