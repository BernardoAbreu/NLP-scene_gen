<L>__{interior sharon's apartment night}
<A>__{she is exercising on the machine, sliding into her crunches, fast and furious, but all the pain and sorrow is in her eyes, and in a moment she just stops. the trumpet music keeps going on through this. she looks over at the phone.}
<L>__{interior catch's apartment night}
<A>__{we pan over bob the dog, watching something. we see a few scattered sheets of music lying about, hearing rustling, and we arrive at catch, seated on the floor, shuffling through a stack of sheet music, driven, looking for something. the phone rings. he ignores it. he is opening up each chart of music, shaking it out, searching. sharon's voice comes on his machine, almost hollow with sorrow.}
<C>__{sharon }
<D>__{catch. can you... pick up?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{will you call me?}
<A>__{he keeps searching, seeming to not even listen. the machine clicks off. he shakes the next music chart and something falls out. he stares at this piece of paper, picks it up, slowly turns it over. it is a picture of himself, a man blowing a horn, drawn in crayon by a four or five year old. catch stares at this with a depth that goes on forever, as the music ends.}
