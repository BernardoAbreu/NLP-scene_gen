<L>__{interior old warehouse day}
<A>__{the kids are here cleaning up the building. the guys throw rotted lumber into trash bins while the girls sweep up. we catch jacob and scott tossing some debris into a wheelbarrow. jacob looks pretty ragged.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{come on. let's hop to it. gotta make way for those new indoor tennis courts. the fate of the world lies in the balance. okay, this load's full.}
<A>__{jacob grabs the handles of the wheelbarrow and shakily picks it up. scott sneers.}
<C>__{scott }
<D>__{you got that?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah, no problem.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe you should think about switching to de caf or something.}
<A>__{jacob ignores him and pushes the wheelbarrow along. scott takes some time off to smoke a cigarette. he spots karen across the room bending over with a dustbin. scott lingers on this view for a long time.}
<B>__{at a dumpster}
<A>__{jacob pulls up with the wheelbarrow and starts to unload the junk. gina is next to the dumpster sweeping. she tries to push a large crate aside by herself, but slips and falls. jacob jumps over to her, reaches out, and grabs her arm to help her up.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{gina screams.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{no! yes! let go of me!}
<A>__{she shakes off his grip and he jumps back. she runs away with a wild look in her eyes as karen steps up to a confused jacob.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{she doesn't like to be touched.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no shit!}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{don't take it personally. it's not her fault.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what happened to her?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{her mother was a hooker. she forced gina to carry on the tradition. when she was thirteen...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{jacob looks off at gina with genuine concern. karen gives him the same expression.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you look terrible.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm sorry...i just wish you'd tell me what happened to you, that's all.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i can't talk about it right now. i will tell you later. i promise.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{okay. why don't you sit and rest for a bit. the supervisor's not around. you look like you could use it.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i think i will.}
<A>__{he gives her a gentle squeeze on the forearm, and karen likes it. jacob spots a pile of wood next to a wall and heads off for it.}
<B>__{on scott}
<A>__{he's watched the entire interchange between jacob and karen, and he doesn't like it.}
<B>__{with jacob}
<A>__{as he goes around the stack of lumber and sits down facing the brick wall. he lets out a heavy sigh and stares at the inside of the building. jacob's pov the brick wall sits there quietly for a few beats until:}
<B>__{it explodes}
<A>__{bricks fly out at us as a gaping hole blows into the wall revealing nothing but blackness and our shot moves through: dream flashes nightmare springwood horrifying apparitions and images zoom by us. gloomy buildings under a pitch black sky. mutants and twisted monsters. shadowy streets and dark alleyways. and five razor blade fingers suddenly ripping right through the sky and down upon us as a voice rings out.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hey, you!}
