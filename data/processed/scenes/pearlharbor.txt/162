<L>__{interior oklahoma rear compartment}
<A>__{in one compartment there are a dozen trapped men. they've survived the roll over, and are in a chaotic world where the floor is now the ceiling. the water is up their waists. some of the sailors are panicking. one sailor has a flashlight and switches it on, flashing the light from face to face.}

<D>__{don't panic! don't panic!}
<C>__{panicked sailor}
<D>__{the water's rising! it's coming up, we're all gonna drown!}
<C>__{sailor with the flashlight}
<D>__{the air pressure will equalize it!}
<A>__{but the water keeps rising, along with their fears. several of the sailors are still screaming... the water's already to their bellies. one of them grabs a wrench and starts slamming morse code against the bulkhead. one sailor in the middle of the room is particularly panicked, not just yelling but crying and whimpering }
<C>__{terrified sailor}
<D>__{get me out! get me out!}
<C>__{sailor with the flashlight}
<D>__{stop it! come on! save your air!}
<C>__{terrified sailor}
<D>__{my foot's caught!}
<A>__{he's at the lower end of the compartment, where the water is deeper the ship's nose is lower than her stern. the water's up to the guy's neck. the man with the flashlight dives down, and finds the guys foot wedged together in the pipes of the ships ceiling now their floor. he pops up again. the water's up to the trapped guy's mouth; he's already gagging.}
<C>__{sailor with the flashlight}
<D>__{is there a hacksaw in that locker?!}
<A>__{they open it; tools spill out among them is a hacksaw. they hand it to him; the sailor dives down and cuts off the guy's foot. the trapped man is underwater, muffling his scream. he comes free, and surfaces gasping. his severed foot floats to the surface and then the horror really hits them. the sailor with the flashlight pops up, in the blossoming of blood. he and another sailor tie a tourniquet around the stump, to stop the bleeding. the drama of this has caused the other trapped men to stop their signaling. now they start banging, twice as loudly as before.}
