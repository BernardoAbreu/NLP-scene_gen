<L>__{interior chamberlain's customer service offices day}
<A>__{a long row of cubicles, each one occupied with customer service operators. as they work, the loud squeaks and popping metal sounds of a dwarf crawling through a duct are heard above them. each operator in succession notes the racket, looking up curiously as the sounds pass overhead. suddenly, the sounds stop. everyone returns to work. then... squeak! pop! squeak! the sounds resume. the operators look up again as the noises fade away.}
