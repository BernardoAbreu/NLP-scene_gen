<L>__{32 m.p.h. the infiniti moves up ten feet behind the pullman,}
<A>__{and blows its horn. mr. eddy rolls down his window. the assistants are paying close attention they buckle their seatbelts. pete notices a tension in the car. he watches mr. eddy's face. mr. eddy pulls slightly to the right of the road, pastes a polite, courteous smile on his face, puts his left arm out the window and waves the infiniti by. the infiniti jets forward and swerves around the pullman. when the cars are side by side, the irate driver in the infiniti gives mr. eddy "the bird" and flies past. close on mr. eddy's right foot as it slams down on the gas pedal. the pullman catapults forward toward the infiniti. pete is thrown back he grabs on to the door handle and the seat for support. the pullman gains on the infiniti in a flash. the infiniti tries to go faster, but mr. eddy's pullman has much more power.}

<P>__{(clenched teeth)}
<D>__{this is where power and mechanical excellence pays off.}
<A>__{mr. eddy jams the pullman into the back of the infiniti and pushes it faster and faster along mulholland. the driver of the infiniti tries to brake and blue gray smoke streams out from beneath the infiniti with a scream of burning rubber. at a turn, mr. eddy steers his massive mercedes and the infiniti ahead on a gut wrenching path off the road, up a mountain and into a little glade of trees. dust and brush fly everywhere. mr. eddy and his assistants leap from the pullman and make for the driver's side of the infiniti. mr. eddy throws open the infiniti's door and pulls the trembling and screaming driver out like a rag doll. mr. eddy pulls out his .44 ruger blackhawk and pistol whips the driver to the ground. he smashes the butt of his gun across the man's face, tearing a gash which starts to gush with blood. mr. eddy's assistants each draw .45's and point them at the driver. mr. eddy, red faced with anger, leans close to the man.}
<C>__{mr. eddy}
<D>__{don't you ever fuckin' tailgate.}
<A>__{mr. eddy hits the driver in the side of the head with his gun.}
<C>__{mr. eddy }

<D>__{i won't ever tailgate.}
<C>__{mr. eddy}
<D>__{do you know how many fuckin' car lengths it takes to stop a car at 35 m.p.h.?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mr. eddy}
<D>__{six fuckin' car lengths... that's about a hundred and six fuckin' feet, mister! you were following ten feet behind me... if i'd had to stop suddenly, you would have hit me. i want you to get a driver's manual, and i want you to study that motherfucker... and i want you to obey the god damn rules. fifty fuckin' thousand people were killed on the road last year.}
<P>__{(hitting the driver once again hard)}
<D>__{cause of fuckin' assholes like you. tell me you're gonna get a manual.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{i will get a manual.}
<P>__{(almost a whisper)}
<D>__{and study it.}
<C>__{mr. eddy}
<P>__{(kicking the man)}
<D>__{fuckin' "a".}
<A>__{mr. eddy and his assistants return to the pullman get in and slam their doors. mr. eddy throws the pullman into reverse and pulls back off the hill onto mulholland drive. he eases the car into "drive" and leaves the crying and beaten tailgater behind.}
