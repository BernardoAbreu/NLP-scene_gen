<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior gym. storm later}
<A>__{alone, sitting up bare chested, glistening with sweat from the lovemaking. he glances across at his reflection in the floor to ceiling mirror. mirror storm seeing himself, just after making love. his wedding ring.}
<B>__{andy}
<A>__{appears in the doorway, returning from the kitchen with a tray and glasses. she wears a robe and has that mussed, after lovemaking glow. she takes one look at storm and her heart sinks. she crosses to him lowers herself gracefully to kneel beside him, setting down the tray and glasses.}
<C>__{storm}
<P>__{(dead)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{she looks at him. she has a good idea what's tormenting his mind. she reaches her hand, gently touches his shoulder ... storm pulls back.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{he gets up, backing slowly away from her seeing the pain in her eyes, feeling his own pain. in frustration, he slams an elbow punch into a piece of gym equipment furiously venting rage! andy flinches at the sound, the violence.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{i'm sorry }
<P>__{(wracked with emotion)}
<D>__{sorry. i }
<C>__{storm }
<P>__{(another furious punch)}
<D>__{why am i still in this fucking cage?! what's wrong with my body? why won't it heal faster?!!}
<A>__{he slams another furious punch. andy gets up, tries to approach storm.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{mason, please}
<P>__{(wants to ease his pain)}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{don't say that!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{why not?!}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{because i can't love you! don't you see? it's seven years to anyone else. but it's only days for me.}
<A>__{andy draws a sharp, pained breath.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{how can i be with you ... how can i want you and take you, when }
<A>__{he can't finish, torn by guilt. he stares at andy. suddenly his tone becomes harsh, accusatory.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{you seduced me. you came in here, looking that way, knowing just what the hell you were doing }
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(defiant)}
<D>__{yeah, i knew. what of it? i wanted you }
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{you have no right to want me!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{then who does?! i've risked my life for you }
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{who asked you to? not me!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{you haven't stopped me!}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{then don't risk it! don't do shit for me! i don't need you!}
<A>__{for a second it look's like he's going to strike her. instead he kicks the tray and glasses which smashes into the floor to ceiling mirror, shattering like a bomb? andy glares at him, stalks for the door }
