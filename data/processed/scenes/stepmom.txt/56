<L>__{interior luke and rachel's bedroom closet night}
<A>__{rachel sits cross legged on the floor of the walk in closet. next to her, a glass and a botle of stolie, getting toward the bottom. an ashtray filled with butts, and... ...a card board box. dragged out of somewhere. photo albums, loose snapshots. vintage stuff. from her face, this is not a carefree romp down memory lane. she takes another hit on the stolie. more than slightly intoxicated, weaving, squinting at... ...the next photo. luke, young, straddling a kawasaki. jackie, just as young, holding him from behind. she wears a halter and shorts, and looks simply terrific. rachel looks drunk and jealous. with an overlay of self pity. brings the photo closer. squints harder.}
