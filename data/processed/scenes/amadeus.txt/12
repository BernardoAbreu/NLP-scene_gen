<L>__{interior old salieri's hospital room late afternoon}
<A>__{a bare room one of the best available in the general hospital. it contains a bed, a table with candles, chairs, a small forte piano of the early nineteenth century. as vogler enters, old salieri is sitting in a wheel chair, looking out the window. his back is to us. the priest closes the door quietly behind him.}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{herr salieri?}
<A>__{old salieri turns around to look at him. we see that his throat is bandaged expertly. he wears hospital garb, and over it the civilian medal and chain with which we will later see the emperor invest him.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{i am father vogler. i am a chaplain here. i thought you might like to talk to someone.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{you tried to take your life. you do remember that, don't you?}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{in the sight of god that is a sin.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{do you understand that you have sinned? gravely.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{leave me alone.}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{i cannot leave alone a soul in pain.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{do you know who i am? you never heard of me, did you?}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{that makes no difference. all men are equal in god's eyes.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{are they?}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{offer me your confession. i can offer you god's forgiveness.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{i do not seek forgiveness.}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{my son, there is something dreadful on your soul. unburden it to me. i'm here only for you. please talk to me.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{how well are you trained in music?}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{i know a little. i studied it in my youth.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{here in vienna.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{then you must know this.}
<A>__{he propels his wheelchair to the forte piano, and plays an unrecognizable melody.}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{i can't say i do. what is it?}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{i'm surprised you don't know. it was a very popular tune in its day. i wrote it. how about this?}
<A>__{he plays another tune.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{this one brought down the house when we played it first.}
<A>__{he plays it with growing enthusiasm.}
