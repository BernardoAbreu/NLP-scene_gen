<A>__{the van pulls up near the edge of a large quarry. the door opens and simon is pushed out, followed by harry, who is in his black jumpsuit and wearing a ski mask. gib follows as harry guides simon to the edge of a sheer drop. harry whips off the hood and simon takes in his surroundings.}

<D>__{yeeaoowww!!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you son of a bitch. did you really think you could elude us forever, carlos?}

<A>__{harry whips off his ski mask.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{ face. shit! shit!!}
<A>__{simon has ducked his head and won't look at harry. then it dawns... he looks up, brightening hopefully.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{it's you! hey, you still interested in that vette at all?}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{you can drop it now, carlos. the game is over. your career as an inter national terrorist is too well documented.}

<A>__{harry whips his pistol out in one liquid motion and snaps the muzzle right in front of simon's eyes.}

<P>__{(he looks down)}
<D>__{see, look... would a spy pee himself?}
<A>__{harry is finally sickened by his grovelling. he pulls simon away from the edge, then gestures with his gun.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{beat it.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no. soon as i turn you'll shoot me.}
<A>__{harry starts back to the truck. simon stays right with him, facing him, terrified to turn away. like a dog following him.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{please don't. you can have the car for free }
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{take off, dipshit!}
<A>__{gib finally shoves simon back and harry contemptuously cranks three rounds into the ground by his feet, forcing him to dance backward. the two agents get into the van and tear off in a cloud of dust. leaving simon alone in the moonlight, miles from nowhere.}
