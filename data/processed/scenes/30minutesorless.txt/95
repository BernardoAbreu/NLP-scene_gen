<L>__{interior jay's garage workshop day}
<A>__{dwayne looks down at his phone.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{that's it. the assassin's gonna kill me now. i'm gonna die. game fucking over.}
<A>__{dwayne cradles his arms around his wounded kidney, rocks back and forth, wallowing in defeat.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{we can still get him the money. try the pizza guy back.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{why? so he can fuck around again, and i wind up dead, anyway? no. i'd rather just sit here. i want to die right here on this couch.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{no. we're gonna get that money. just like we planned. all we gotta do is get the leverage back.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{how do we do that? pizza boy's obviously got some kinda death wish.}
<A>__{jay gathers his resolve.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{we take the girl. the one he went to see. then he won't try shit.}
<A>__{dwayne looks up at jay with something not unlike awe.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{that's actually...that's a great fucking idea, jay. it's the best idea anyone's had all day.}
<A>__{dwayne lowers his head. he removes the gun from his belt...holds it out to jay. jay takes it. feels its weight. then offers it back.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i was just trying to figure out how you would do it, dwayne.}
<A>__{dwayne takes the gun. struggles to stand. jay helps him.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{ok. then let's do it right. we leave nothing to chance. because if we go to prison for this, i won't be able to watch out for you.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{ok, dwayne.}
<A>__{dwayne looks over at a frame backpack hanging from a hook on the wall. pvc piping bulges from it.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{you should probably bring the flamethrower, buddy. there's gonna be some evidence to dispose of.}
