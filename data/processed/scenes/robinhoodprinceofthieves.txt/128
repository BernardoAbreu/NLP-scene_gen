<L>__{interior castle chapel day}
<A>__{sword raised, nottingham has robin backed against the altar.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{what can your puny god do for you now?}
<A>__{the blade comes whirring down... clang! it's blocked. robin has the altar's crucifix in his hand. he swings it again, slamming nottingham across the temple. the sheriff hits the floor. robin grabs his father's sword. raises it two fisted. nottingham tries to squirm away.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{this is for my father.}
<A>__{he drives the sword down, like a stake, right through nottingham's heart. the man shudders, and is still. robin stands over him. drained. tuck rushes outside. kneels at aslan's side. robin spots marian swaying on the edge of the steep parapet.}
