<L>__{interior kate's room.}
<A>__{dade shows up. kate, nikon, and cereal are working on the disc.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{kate, listen.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{uh, hold on...}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{i have to tell you something.}
<C>__{cereal}
<D>__{hold on a second!}
<C>__{nikon}
<D>__{look at this, it's so lean and clean.}
<C>__{cereal}
<D>__{looks like a hacker wrote it.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{come here, look at this. this thing is dense.}
<A>__{nikon points out part of the code.}
<C>__{nikon}
<D>__{but that's ill, man. it's incomplete. this is taking forever and a day to figure out. i'm gonna make some coffee.}
<A>__{dade takes nikon's place.}
<C>__{cereal}
<D>__{tag, you're in.}
<A>__{hours pass. dade studies and reverse engineers the garbage file. the other hackers watch, and do just about anything but be hackers. finally, over boxes of half finished pizza, dade makes an announcement.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{this isn't a virus. it's a worm!}
<C>__{nikon}
<D>__{what's this one eat?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{it nibbles. you see this?}
<A>__{dade indicates a rapidly scrolling data display.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{this is every financial transaction ellingson conducts, yeah? from million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{the worm eats a few cents from each transaction.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{and no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. it's just data being shifted around.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{right. and when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{joey got cut off before he got to that part. check it out. by this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{right, and at this rate it ends its run in...}
<C>__{nikon}
<D>__{two days.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{and judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...}
<C>__{cereal}
<D>__{21.8 million bucks, man.}
<A>__{nikon whistles.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. and that's phreak, and that's joey, and that's us. we've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out who created it.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{i know, i know who wrote it.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{this ellingson security creep. i gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you what?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{i didn't know what was on it.}
<C>__{cereal}
<P>__{(agitated)}
<D>__{oh man. that's universally stupid, man!}
<C>__{nikon}
<D>__{yo, man, you an amateur, man.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{why did he come to you?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{i got a record. i was zero cool.}
<C>__{nikon}
<D>__{zero cool? crashed fifteen hundred and seven systems in one day?}
<A>__{nikon closes his eyes and access his photographic memory.}
<C>__{nikon}
<D>__{biggest crash in history, front page, new york times, august 10th, 1988. i thought you was black, man! yo, man, this is zero cool! oh, shit!}
<C>__{cereal}
<D>__{that's far out!}
<C>__{nikon}
<D>__{this is zero cool, man! whooo, haha!}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{well that's great. there goes mit.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{i will make it up to you!}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{i will hack the gibson.}
<C>__{nikon}
<D>__{they'll trace you like that}
<P>__{(snaps his fingers)}
<D>__{man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{fucked if i care, man.}
<C>__{nikon}
<D>__{look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, i mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.}
<C>__{cereal}
<D>__{oh wow, we are fried.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(suddenly lighter hearted)}
<D>__{never send a boy to do a woman's job. with me, we can do it in seven.}
<C>__{cereal}
<D>__{you're both screwed. i help, we can do it in six.}
<C>__{nikon}
<D>__{jesus, i gotta save all your asses. i help, we can do it in five minutes, man.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{okay. let's go shopping.}
<C>__{cereal}
<D>__{woo hoo! boom!}
