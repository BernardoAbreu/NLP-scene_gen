<L>__{100 feet below. it is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with}
<A>__{lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet are stepping. it's painted to blend in with the rocks below. highly evolved camouflage... in perfect alignment with everything we see below. when indy leans out to the left or right... that's when he sees the perfect alignment shift that betrays the trick. indy throws some dirt on the bridge and he crosses it like the first crusader from the painting over henry's desk. indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a temple. a vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small temple. perhaps a hundred or more. many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all glitter and shine. indy is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. and then he realizes that a man is praying at the altarl he has his back turned to indy... but he is dressed as what he is! a grail}
<B>__{knight. close on the grail knight}
<A>__{but we can't see the grail knight's face. the visor of his helmet is down. perhaps we see his eyes. when the grail knight sees indy he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly, prepares to give combat...taking up his two handed broadsword...he comes at indy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too much. indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt to fight back...until the knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. indy approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the knight is a very ancient man.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{i knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{the last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the grail and to guard it.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{that was seven hundred years ago.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{a long time to wait.}
<A>__{the grail knight reaches forward and fingers indy's clothing.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{you're strangely dressed...for a knight.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i'm not exactly...a knight. what do you mean?}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{i was chosen because i was the bravest and the most worthy. the honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. i pass it to you who vanquished me.}
<A>__{the grail knight holds his sword out to indy.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(gulp)}
<D>__{listen, i don't have time to explain, but}
<A>__{at that moment donovan and elsa appear. donovan turns to face the display of cups.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{which one is it?}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{you must choose.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but choose wisely. for as the true grail will bring you life the false grail will take it from you.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{i'm not a historian. i have no idea what it looks like. which one is it?}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{let me choose.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{thank you, doctor.}
<A>__{elsa and indy exchange looks. he thinks he is seeing her in her true colors. elsa chooses a cupa solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet. donovan instantly takes it from her.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{oh, yes. it's more beautiful than i'd ever imagined. this certainly is the cup of the king of kings.}
<A>__{donovan rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{eternal life!}
<A>__{donovan drinks from the goblet. then, donovan's entire body starts to convulse. his face contorts in agony. he grabs his stomach and turns toward elsa.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{what . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . . me. . .?}
<A>__{he starts to agefast! his hair grows long and gray and brittle. his face sinks. fingernails curl back on themselves. milky cataracts coat his eyes. elsa gasps and screams.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{what. . . is . . . happening. . . ?}
<A>__{his skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits. his skeletal hands reach for elsa's throat, choking her. indy rushes forward and pushes donovan away. as he falls he body breaks}
