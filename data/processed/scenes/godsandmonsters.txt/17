<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(feigning surprise)}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{whale looks up at edmund kay, 22, a slim boy who rests his weight on one slouched hip, his arms twined behind him. there is a look of mild disappointment on whale's face as he realizes that kay is a baby poof.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{ah, mr. kay. i'd almost forgotten. my guest for tea.}
<A>__{whale stands and holds out his hand.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{mr. whale, this is such an honor. you're one of my favorite all time directors. i can't believe i'm meeting you.}
<C>__{whale}

<P>__{(looks around)}

<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i know. people's movies aren't their lives.}
<A>__{he suddenly growls out an imitation of boris karloff.}

<A>__{kay laughs, a high, girlish giggle. whale fights a cringe with a polite smile.}

<C>__{whale}
<D>__{is it now? hanna? i think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.}
<A>__{it's clear from hanna's frown that she doesn't approve of the idea. whale ignores her, turns back to kay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{will that be good for you, mr. kay?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{whale}
