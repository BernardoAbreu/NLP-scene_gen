<L>__{interior the back room of the debonair social club}
<A>__{the room is furnished with a few round tables and some chairs; it is somewhat reminiscent of an old fashioned candy store. tommy como, salvy, patsy and joey are present. salvy's face is bruised from the beating joey gave him.}
<C>__{como}
<D>__{all rightg i don't have to hear any more. i think i understand what happened. i understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. i'm not sayin' salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. but, joey, you don't raise your hands. you don't do that kind of thing. this time we forget about it but no more after this. you understand?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{yeah, i understand, tommy.}
<C>__{como}

<P>__{(to salvy and patsy)}

<C>__{joey}
<D>__{aw, tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.}
<C>__{como}
<D>__{look joey, i wanna tell you something. your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us nowhere. and i'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{how can he embarrass you?}
<C>__{como}
<D>__{he's an embarrassment because frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and i'm lookin' very bad. i can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. why's he make it so hard on himself? he comes to me, i can make it easier for him.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{tommy, jake respects you. he won't even say hello to anybody else you know that. but you know when jake gets set on somethin', jesus christ almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. i'm his kid brother. i got no say with jake on this. he thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.}
<C>__{como}
<D>__{make it on his own? does he know the kind of money involved? i mean the real money. he thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? we're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? a nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? is he really crazy? listen, joey, you understand, you tell him. i don't care how great he is or how colorful. he could beat all the sugar ray robinsons and all the janiros he wants to. he ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. i'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!}
