<L>__{interior dressing room later}
<A>__{a small, cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a sputtering fan for ventilation. christy has her own dressing table and mirror, and the ronelles share a table a few feet away. clothing and costumes hang on nails or are draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear.}
