<L>__{interior living room, waitress' apartment, an hour or so later}
<A>__{she is visibly drained, after the day and the drinks.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{they told me i joined the army when i was seventeen. that's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since i was born 'cause my mom split.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{so you never knew your mother?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i guess not. but, as of now, i never knew either.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{yeah. [beat] how about you?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{never knew my father. i grew up with my mother. actually, i grew up around my mother. she was great though. i mean, the way she was with her friends... she was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [beat] she died young.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{she fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [beat] i came home from work and she was gone.}
<A>__{the tears still run after all these years.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{yeah, me too. [softly] every day for the last ten years.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{that when you stopped being a nurse?}
<A>__{she is surprised that he gleaned the connection and that he'd been listening so closely.}
<D>__{waitress [exhausted] yeah, that's when i stopped being a nurse. i never thought i could stop being one, i wanted it for so long, but... you just can't do it anymore when you lose someone like that. you can't take care of other people.}
<A>__{she closes her eyes and finally passes out. starks watches her face, lit serenely by the fire and the christmas lights. it bears her grief even in sleep. he covers her with a blanket then looks around and spots the only personal effects in the room on her mantle. he walks towards them, tripping slightly on a cord from the lights. he stumbles but regains his balance by reaching for the wall. as he pulls himself up, he spots what is only inches away from where his hand landed on the wall: his own dog tags, given to jackie, only a couple weeks ago, hanging from a single nail tacked into the wall. stunned, he stares at his name and birth date scored on the metal. he looks back at the waitress and then to the few pictures on the mantle: they are of jackie and her mother, jean. starks runs his hand through his hair, trying to swallow the improbability, and inexplicability, of the situation. starks' eyes search the room for anything that could help him figure out what's happening. on the console is an old paper and some mail. totally disoriented, starks nearly stumbles on his way to the pile. the label on the first bill reads "jackie price." on the second, the same. and the third...until at the bottom of the pile, starks spots an old newspaper with the answer on its date: december 3, 2004. starks is absolutely stunned. starks looks over at jackie and, just then, the harsh sound of the drawer being opened rings deafeningly in his ears and the image of her starts to dissolve : at this worst moment. he is being taken out of the jacket...}
