<L>__{interior glen falls, cave flaming torch night}
<A>__{widen. the cave is filled with hurons. the redcoat is dead in the corner. a group of braves moves away from the body of the ranger. heyward's surrounded. the women are behind him. he slashes at one huron with his sword and is clubbed down by a giant.}
<B>__{magua}
<A>__{enters. his blanket, like a shawl, over his left shoulder, black plumes in his hair. he's imperturbable. magua's hand reaches out and touches cora's hair. cora is frozen to the spot. his hand drops away from the hated munros and as magua turns to go, he says something low in huron and the two women are jerked towards the fissures. heyward is dragged by the arms.}
