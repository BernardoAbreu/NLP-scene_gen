<L>__{exterior a park day}
<A>__{trees. a picnic table. and mercedes tainot writing individual words on pages of a steno book. after each word, she folds each page many times and puts it in a basket. up walks dean tainot, who looks neither happy nor cheerful.}
<C>__{dean tainot}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{thanks for coming.}
<C>__{dean tainot}
<D>__{no notice. no preamble. just an email and a google map.}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{i knew you'd be on the computer.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{working...}
<C>__{dean tainot}
<D>__{point made.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{so. what up.}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{are we making a mistake here?}
<C>__{dean tainot}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{point made. we could change things. we could start right now.}
<C>__{dean tainot}
<D>__{we could. why should we?}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{because we have history, dean. but first, my thoughts... i've got to address drinking. i should be able to comprehend and respond to both sides of our conversations. and the morning shower should be refreshing, not a hangover cure.}
<C>__{dean tainot}
<D>__{i'd like that too.}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{dean tainot}
<D>__{you're not a pleasant woman after a few glasses. mornings with you are to be survived.}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{okay. now, you.}
<A>__{dean is caught short.}
<C>__{dean tainot}
<D>__{i see. i'm what this is all about.}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{there are plenty of items on the relationship agenda but let's start here.}
<C>__{dean tainot}
<D>__{you're talking about you but you really mean me.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i am not yelling or begging or saying you have to stop doing anything. so you don't get to either.}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{i'm not saying that.}
<C>__{dean tainot}
<D>__{we've both been here before. why prolong the process? white flag! i give up. this ain't working.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i will sign papers and checks, see if there's enough for a cool sports car as a reward for the last few years and eventually i will be fine and you will too. but i am never once going to look at myself as another poor divorced guy who could still be married if only he had done the mea culpa bit for all his faults.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i just now came up with that, and it is going to be my next posting.}
<A>__{he pulls out his blackberry and makes a note to himself.}
<C>__{dean tainot }
<D>__{i don't think there is anything else to talk about. do you?}
<A>__{mercedes looks at him. she has been a fool...}
