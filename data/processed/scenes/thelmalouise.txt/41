<L>__{interior police garage day}
<A>__{hal is at the police station where they're dusting the car with harlan all over it for prints. hal looks closely at the back of the car. he holds his hands over two sets of hand prints. he moves his hands to the outside of the prints so as not to smear them, and puts his hands on the car. his face is one inch away from the trunk. he sees a very clear drop of blood. it's different than any of the other blood splatters on the car. he calls the identification technician over and points it out.}

<D>__{whose?}
<C>__{i.d. tech}
<D>__{his, i guess...}
<A>__{hal makes a face like he suddenly felt a slight toothache. he stares at the guy.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{you guess?}
<A>__{hal takes out a black sharpie and draws a circle around the area of the black smudge and the drop of blood. he shakes his head slightly.}
