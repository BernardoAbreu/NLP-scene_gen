<L>__{interior alex's house second floor night}
<A>__{john moves david quickly up the stairs in front of him and down the hall. they peer into one room, nothing. into the next what is clearly a child's room. alex kneels on the far side of the room, barely visible behind the small bed, his back to us. until he wheels, gun in hand, and fires twice. a bullet strikes david in the chest, the second grazes john's side. both men are knocked back into the hall and onto the floor. john pulls himself out from under david as... running on adrenaline, alex stands and strides forward. david looks up at him. alex shoots him again and steps over him into the hall. he sees john, raises his weapon and.... john fires twice, hits alex in the chest, knocking him down. john stands. alex lies dead, sprawled over david. david looks around through the roiling smoke:}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{is anyone up here?!}
<A>__{he steps over alex and into the room. he checks the closet empty of clothes; clearly no child lives here. john turns to where alex was kneeling, sees a bureau pushed aside, a safe crudely installed in the wall lying open, a trash bag on the floor half filled with cash. john drops to his knees and shovels the remaining cash into the trash bag.}
