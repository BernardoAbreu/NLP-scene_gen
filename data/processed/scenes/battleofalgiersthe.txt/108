<L>__{107 villa headquarters. inside. dawn.}
<A>__{in some parts of the villa a gramophone is playing "la vie en rose." in the room on the first floor, through the large window, the whiteness of the dawn is visible. the desk is cluttered with beer cans and thermos. mathieu and other officers have their eyes fixed on the graph, where the captain is marking other small crosses at the bottom of the pyramid. the scene is motionless; their expressions are dull. everyone seems to be incapable of movement, overcome by the dull apathy that always follows a sleepless night. until mathieu breaks the stillness of the scene.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{good ... good work ... now we can all go to sleep.}
<A>__{and moving together with the others, he continues.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{the end of the strike doesn't change anything. the directives remain the same. give your men the usual shifts. we must remain in the casbah: twenty four hours a day!}
<A>__{he turns and points to the graph.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{we must cling to it, and work fast!}
<A>__{then he turns to the officers and smiling, says in another tone of voice:}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{have any of you ever had a tapeworm?}
<A>__{the officers say "no" and laugh.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{the tapeworm is a worm that can grow to infinity. there are thousands of segments. you can destroy all of them; but as long as the head remains, it reproduces itself immediately. it is the same thing with the nlf. the head is the general staff, four persons. until we are able to eliminate them, we must always start again from the beginning.}
<A>__{while he is speaking, mathieu takes his wallet from his back pocket, opens it, takes out four photos.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{i found these in the police archives. they are old shots, but i made some close ups. ramel ... si mourad ... kader ... ali la pointe. we must print a thousand copies and distribute them to the men.}
<A>__{meanwhile, the photos are passed around. there are photos taken from identification cards, or blown up from some group shots, figures somewhat blurred, faded, smiling, peaceful ...}
