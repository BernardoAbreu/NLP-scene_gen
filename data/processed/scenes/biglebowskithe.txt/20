<B>__{close shot the dude}
<A>__{his eyes are closed, a headset on, his shirt off. leaking tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of "comin' up around the bend." behind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his torso, a white smocked figure taps at the dude's back. after a moment the figure circles to one side, out of frame. his hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the dude's ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{could you slide your shorts down please, mr. lebowski?}

<B>__{the dude}
<A>__{his eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it out the driver's window except that the window is not open. the butt bounces off the glass and around the car, showering sparks. dude's crotch the glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs. the dude screams.}
<B>__{the street}
<A>__{the car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off to, make way, horns blaring. the car finally spins and comes to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone poll.}
<B>__{inside the car}
<A>__{the dude frantically grabs at his door, which won't open, and then slides over to push at the passenger door, which also won't open.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{fuck me.}
<A>__{but he is sitting on the passenger side now, away from the lit butt. he looks around for it. smoke is wisping up from between the driver's seat cushion and back cushion.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{fuckola, man.}
<A>__{he takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions. there is a hissing sound. but there is a piece of paper sticking out from between the cushions. the dude pulls it out. it is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and dripping beer, covered with handwriting. in the upper right hand corner is the name lawrence sellers, and under that, mrs. jamtoss 5th period. the theme is titled "the louisiana purchase." in red ink is a large circled d and some handwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled in red throughout. crane jackson's fountain street theater we are behind walter, the dude, and donny, facing the stage in the background where allan, the dude's balding landlord, is performing a dance moderne. as walter talks to the dude he leans in to him, his voice hushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse audience.}
