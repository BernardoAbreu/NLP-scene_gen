<D>__{i don't know. count basie? duke ellington. i don't know. count basie.}
<A>__{the man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses to do so, is irritated by his mistake. he ejects the record. a pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered table which includes classical sheet music and a paper keyboard. one hand idly mimes at the keys.}
<L>__{interior ripley's apartment. day.}
<A>__{another song for ripley to identify is on the gramophone. chet baker's my funny valentine . signs everywhere of packing. a suitcase. books about italy. ripley paces in this basement room, which is bathroom, kitchen, living room and bedroom all in one. tiny, tidy, squalid and sad. the windows give onto bars and a wall.}

<D>__{you've got dickie's rings.}

<A>__{she goes off obediently, a zombie. he shuts the door. immediately he starts looking for something, anything, to kill marge with. he's got a shoe but it feels too light. he opens cabinets, drawers nail scissors, nothing then picks up his straight razor and considers it in the mirror.}

<D>__{today, for the first time, i've even wondered whether he might have killed freddie. he would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him well, you know that. marge. i loved you you might as well know i loved you, and because he knew i loved you, he let you think i loved him. didn't you see, couldn't you see? i don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. tom loves me.}

<C>__{maccarron}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{see in america we're taught to check a fact before it becomes a fact. we're taught to nose around when a girl drowns herself, find out if that girl was pregnant, find out if dickie had an embarrassment there.}

<A>__{he puts his hand out to control her. she pushes it away. starts to lash out at him, the frustration too much, so that ripley has to cover his face. maccarron comes off the boat to restrain her. ripley looks at him as if to say: what can you do, she's hysterical. maccarron nods, pulls her on to the boat. greenleaf catches ripley's eye, guiltily. turns away. they stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off towards open waters, passing the little fleets of gondolas.}
