<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{ paragraph by paragraph: new york, new york. a new breed of narcotics has swept the great city, bringing with it a ferocious crime wave more terrifying than any in recent memory. the old criminal order is gone. in its place, new ethnic groups rise up to seize control without respect for traditional rules of engagement. outmanned and outgunned, demoralized by cutbacks and scandal, the police find themselves burying one of their own at the rate of twice a month... the words turn blood red, then disappear. the police lower the coffin when they arrive at the site. as we begin to zoom into a close angle on them, we hear music. a thumping pop beat. the clash's "rock the casbah"...}

<A>__{a huge, bustling, vibrant nightclub, very `80's. decadent, pure new york. bobby emerges from the back room area, straightening out his outfit. rosario is behind him, fixing herself and walking toward the front of the club. bobby enters the pulsing, vital heart of the place. as he appears, everyone approaches, happily shouting out his name. he is having a blast. bobby is the master of this domain. an `80's version of tony manero from saturday night fever, but without kitsch. he is genuine cool. music: blondie's "heart of glass." bobby waves hello to people, greets them ("hey, baby!"), a pretty girl kisses him (the women love him). moves with a swagger, a dance. as he sways, he re buttons his shirt, claps his hands. he is the club manager, and he loves every minute of it. he's giddy, alive, a permanent grin. we want his life. sensuous, seductive, incredible fun. a man waves to bobby. bobby sees: seated at a table, surrounded by his gang: vadim nezhinski. thirty five, acne scarred, huge black pompadour, big gut. one of his men, pavel lubyarsky, is next to him. bobby nods back to them.}

<D>__{what the fuck's goin' on in here?}
<A>__{bobby moves right in. grabs a struggling and drunk patron, puts him in a headlock. he gives the patron a shot to the temple, just to keep him docile. lou, bobby's best friend, watches the imbroglio with an amused and cowardly detachment, chortling with every punch and scream. he balances a drink in his hand with marvelous care, avoiding spillage. but the battle gets closer and closer. seeing his friend bobby, who's hardly got everything in control:}
