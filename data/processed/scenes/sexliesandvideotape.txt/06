<L>__{interior cynthia bishop's apartment day}
<A>__{cynthia bishop, ann's sister, opens her door to reveal the freshly coifed john millaney. they kiss passionately and begin to disrobe. cynthia bears a slight resemblance to ann, but is not as overtly attractive. she does, however, have a definite carnal appeal and air of confidence that ann lacks.}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{when did you begin having this feeling?}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{about a week ago. i don't know what brought it on, i just started feeling like i didn't want him to touch me.}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(voice over, to ann)}
<D>__{prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but see, i've never really been into sex that much, i mean, i like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, i wouldn't miss it, you know? but anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. like i said, it's not that i miss it, but i m curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.}
<A>__{john and cynthia are now having sex.}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{but see, he stopped before i got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. i mean, i'm sure he wishes i would initiate things once in awhile, and i would except it never occurs to me, i'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that i have felt like starting something i was by myself.}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{did you do anything?}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{did you masturbate?}
