<D>__{hello, pete? now, listen...}
<A>__{reverse shot main street black rock shooting down the street as macreedy slowly walks toward the hotel. not a person has moved, each eye is glued on the stranger. the hollow rasp of macreedy's tread on the wooden platform of the "pavement" seems shatteringly loud in the enveloping silence... close shot liz as she follows the man's movement.}
<B>__{out}
<A>__{sequence from original script. close angle on macreedy as he walks along. he feels the eyes of everyone following him, glaring at him. he halts, looks around. the townspeople continue to eye him brazenly, yet with an almost animal incuriosity. he grins and walks on past a cluster of five or six rfd mail boxes and a road sign [1], its paint peeling, its face punctured by three or four bullets from a drunk's pistol long ago. shot macreedy heading toward the hotel. in b.g. is a relatively small farm equipment yard compressed between a general store (which macreedy has just passed) and the hotel just ahead. in the yard are a few tractors, and among them huddles a tiny office. it is empty; the front window is thick with dust. on it, etched by an anonymous, childish finger, is a skull and crossbones. running diagonally across is the printed legend:}

<A>__{macreedy notes the inscription with a sort of wry bemusement. he walks on, reaching the facade of the weather beaten hotel. a gust of wind swirls down the street, momentarily engulfing macreedy and the entire area in a sudden eddying whirlpool. as it subsides... another angle macreedy as he peers through the dust toward the dingy hotel. it has a narrow stoop and outsize bay windows on each side. macreedy mounts the hotel steps. at the top of the steps coley trimble and hector david watch him silently. hector is large and leanly muscular, yet coley looms over him like a battleship. he is a gross behemoth of a man, with sharp flinty eyes the size of glistening pinpoints and a slack, oversized jaw. both men wear modern western work clothes, but there is one incongruous accessory which hector affects. around his thick wrist is a watch with a large flat face and an elaborately tooled leather strap a cheap reproduction of one of those expensive swiss timepieces which, among many distinguished accomplishments, tells the day of the week, the month of the year, the phase of the moon, etc., etc.}
