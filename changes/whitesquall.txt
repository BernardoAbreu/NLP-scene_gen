A loud "THUD!" turns everyone around.  A duffel bag lies at the bottom of the companionway.  A large imposing figure climbs into the cabin. This is JOHN GOODALL, 17, over six feet, big and broad. His hair is slicked back "Dean" style and wears a full day's growth of bread on his face.  Compared to the others, he looks all man.  Everybody clears from his path. He stops in front of the lower, center bunk (Terry's bunk) and drops his bag.}

Suddenly, they all feel it.  A presence.  He has appeared silently on top of the Chart House, like a phantom gazing down at them, back lit by the sun the boys must squint to see him. RICHARD SHELDRAKE, (SKIPPER), ageless and windswept, casually reaches up to a block and tackle with one arm and glides to the deck.  He is powerfully built and bronzed from the sea and sun.  He carriers the burden of command like a cross.  Soft-spoken and remote, he is a man to be reckoned with.  The crew know they are in the presence of someone larger than life.}
