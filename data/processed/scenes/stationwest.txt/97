<L>__{exterior country day}
<A>__{haven, driving a wagon and team of horses, is retracing the road he took back from the sawmill looking for the place where he dumped the bullion. closer view of haven, as he looks for the landmarks. he is whistling softly the tune that charlie always sings. at last he stops, alights and makes his way down the steep slope, a couple of gunny sacks slung across his shoulder. bottom of the gulley as haven gets there and locates the crate at rest in a clump of brush. the crate has broken from the fall. haven loads the buckskin bags of gold into the gunny sack and scrambles back up the slope. side of slope as haven scrambles to the top, he finds himself looking into a six shooter held in the unwavering hand of mrs. caslon. her eyes are hard and a grim smile plays at the corners of her mouth.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{drop it.}
<A>__{haven obeys.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{turn around with your hands up.}
<A>__{haven turns. she takes his gun and tosses it in the wagon; then glances inside the sack, sees the gold. she backs off a step or two.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{all right put it in the wagon.}
<A>__{haven turns to obey. he manages a smile at her.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{is this a hold up?}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{you want to put it in the wagon?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(looking at her hard eyes)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{he struggles with the sack, swings it onto the wagon in which he came. then stands back, looking at her.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{now was there something you wanted to say?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i trailed one of the bandits here where they cached it. i couldn't haul it on horseback, so i came here with the wagon.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{i know that's a lie.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{some of it's true.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{but not nearly enough.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i will try it again. i cached it here myself. i was going to turn it over to them. i wanted to buy a membership in their club. this was the initiation fee.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{fifty thousand dollars?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{well, you see, i thought it was worth it.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{well, you see, i don't.}
<A>__{she climbs to the seat of the wagon watching him warily. haven doesn't move.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{what you're doing may get me into serious trouble.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{if you're still in town in twenty four hours, i promise what i do may get you hanged.}
<A>__{she grabs the rein of her own horse, flicks the reins of the wagon team and rides away, leaving haven on the road, horseless and very much discountenanced. he watches grimly as she rides away. at a distance from him she tosses his gun beside the road.}
