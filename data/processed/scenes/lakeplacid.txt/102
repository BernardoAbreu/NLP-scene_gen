<L>__{exterior lake (surface) continuous}
<A>__{hector breaks the top. lifts his mask, looks toward the chopper, which he sees about forty yards out. he continues to breaststroke on the surface. suddenly... the croc's head rises up right behind hector, who's oblivious. he continues to swim. the croc follows. then... maybe divine intuition... hector gets a feeling he's being followed. he then turns to look the other way, upon which his face goes rigid.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{about three feet from his nose... are two giant eyes staring at him.}

<A>__{ashen.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{oh.... my.}
<A>__{the croc doesn't move. it just stares at him. then end of his snout is almost touching hector. hector himself doesn't dare move, for fear of spooking the croc into action. we get the idea that looking into the eyes of this crocodile is not filling any spiritual voids. a beat.}
<C>__{hector }
<D>__{i suddenly feel a bit foolish.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{you're different from the others.}
<A>__{the croc raises his head now to reveal the snout. and his deadly smile. hector just tries to tread water with as little motion as possible. he deathly fears a quick movement will cause his life to be over. perhaps this is what he came for. to be judged by this symbol of mythology. he backswims ever so slightly. the croc pursues just as slowly, their eyes are locked. he could snap off hector's head in an instant.}
<C>__{hector }
<P>__{(terrified; trying to convince himself)}
<D>__{holy spirit of sobek. holy ghost.}
<P>__{(swallows)}
<D>__{holy shit.}
