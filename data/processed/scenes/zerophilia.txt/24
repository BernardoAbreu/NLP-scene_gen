<L>__{interior orlando's bed & breakfast night}
<A>__{a persistent knock on the door. sydney pulls on a robe over a pair of men's boxers, wiping sleep from her eyes. she swings the door open. luke stands outside in pouring rain.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{oh, honey. come in.}
<B>__{by the fireplace}
<A>__{sydney pours hot tea.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you're one too. why didn't you tell me?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i didn't want to confuse the issue.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{so, it's true what you said? you really know. i wouldn't change unless i wanted to?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{maybe some part of you.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what part? how much of me? i mean, for it to work? half? more than half? what if it was only a tiny bit, a thought?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i don't know. but i believe there may be thousands of z's out there, millions for all we know, go their whole lives without even knowing they are one. nothing ever happens. you couldn't keep it from happening.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i love being with michelle. how come i can't control it when she's around?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i think whatever part of yourself you deny, just gets bigger and bigger until it takes you over.}
<A>__{luke nods sadly.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you think i don't really want to be a man.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i think for some, making it stop is more important than knowing who you are. it was for me.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{maybe for me too.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{right now, you're morphescent. the key is to have sex with another z. you become adulmorphic. your gender locks. you can't just change anytime you want.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{another z?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{that's why i came all the way out here.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{and why you keep tryin' to get me in the sack?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{thought maybe i could save you some distress. but you say you're not attracted to me. for it to work, both of us have to be into it.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{that won't be a problem.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{okay then.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{tonight.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{not right now? okay. tonight.}
