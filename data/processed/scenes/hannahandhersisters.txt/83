<L>__{interior hannah's apartment thanksgiving night}
<A>__{it's thanksgiving at hannah's once again. guests are crowded together in the living room, surrounding the piano, where evan is sitting and flipping through some sheet music. norma stands behind him, leaning against a book laden wall. the guests are chattering, enjoying themselves; a lamp glows on the corner of the piano. a little boy sitting in a chair next to evan is talking animatedly with a girl who is leaning over the arm of the sofa. an adult guest talks to the little boy; another guest takes a sip of wine from a glass she'd placed on the bookshelf behind her as evan turns and addresses the group.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{now, here...here's a song that norma sang on that trip we made up to the show in buffalo. and, oh, was she beautiful that night!}
<A>__{the guests laugh appreciatively. a woman comes over to evan and hands him some wine.}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{come on.}
<P>__{(laughing and touching evan's shoulder)}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(overlapping, to the woman)}
<D>__{thank you, honey.}
<P>__{(putting his drink down on the piano)}
<D>__{oh, yes, you were, dear. don't you remember that night?}
<P>__{(gesturing and}
<D>__{pushing back some sheet music that was}
<P>__{starting to fall)}
<D>__{she was so beautiful...she was so beautiful that when men saw her walking along the streets, they'd drive their cars right up on the sidewalk.}
<A>__{he laughs; the guests laugh with him.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(looking back at norma)}
<D>__{isn't that right, honey, eh?}
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(tapping his shoulder)}
<D>__{a slight exaggeration.}
<A>__{the guest continue to laugh; they are charmed.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(overlapping norma, laughing)}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{but only slight.}
<A>__{evan continues to laugh with everyone as he starts to play the piano. a nearby woman toasts him with her drink. the camera moves around the room as he plays, showing the various guests, chattering over the music. some are in clusters, in private conversations; others listen and watch the offscreen evan. a couple stands by the window; one man gets up from his chair and walks away. some guests sip their drinks, smiling, as the camera moves back to the piano and the book laden wall. evan is playing the piano with exuberance. norma, still standing behind him, has a poignant, wistful expression on her face. she mouths the words to the song evan is playing, "it could happen to you." the woman next to her smiles, enjoying the music, as the camera continues its exploration, moving to a man standing in the doorway with a group of children. mavis the maid walks by with a tray of hors d'oeuvres. the man takes one, mouthing his thanks, as the camera travels past the open bookshelf, past two boys in suits who are drinking soda and munching, to reveal lee. she is leaning against another doorway, a faraway look on her face as she listens to the music. mavis passes in the hall beyond the doorway. several people, deep in conversation, stand nearby as elliot, holding a drink, walks up behind her.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(sipping his drink)}
<D>__{you've been very cold to me tonight.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(glancing back at elliot, then turning away)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{is something wrong?}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{oh, not here.}
<P>__{(touching elliot's arm)}
<D>__{there are too many people around.}
<A>__{lee slips past elliot and walks away. elliot looks back at her briefly, then, sipping his drink, he turns and looks offscreen at the crowd in the living room.}
