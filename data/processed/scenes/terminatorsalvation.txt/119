<A>__{they've left the main street now, driving down a wooded path leading to the "facility." there are lawns, fountains, etc. marcus slams on the brakes, then clutches jeremy by the throat the man looks more annoyed than frightened.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{tell me everything. how did you people get here?}
<C>__{jeremy}

<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{advanced nexus of genetic and electronic life forms... a n g e l. you can stop choking me, it's not like i need to breathe.}

<D>__{the goal was a superior support system for the human brain to go anywhere, do anything explore deep space, the bottom of the sea. i specialized in optics.}
<A>__{he taps his own eye with an audible click, not flinching. marcus takes a couple steps away, looking at his own hands. jeremy points to nearby buildings, a little peevish.}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{the facility is just ahead. i will let them know you're coming.}
<A>__{so saying, he's back in the cart, pulling away in a hurry. a moment later, marcus moves off amongst the trees. nearing the complex, marcus reacts to birdsong above. he looks up, stops as he sees a tiny speaker, concealed amongst the leaves. marcus moves to this tree, touches it the bark feels unnatural. he raps it with his fist it sounds hollow, made of fiberglas. he fingers a leaf, tries to bend it plastic. he crouches, studying the grass. after a moment, he finds a seam in the pristine lawn. he starts to peel it up... it's astroturf. beneath it is sandy dirt. marcus keeps peeling the plastic covering back... more dirt and bits of bone. as he continues to uncover the ground we see recognizable chunks of skulls, legbones, etc. by now he's rolled back a few square yards, numb with horror. marcus moves on toward the complex with new determination, trying to stay out of sight.}
