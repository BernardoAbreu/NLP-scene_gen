<A>__{jim gives him a look, turns back to the window, sizing up an escape, starts muttering to himself.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{if i could just get over to that scaffolding...}
<A>__{he tests the window frame, finds it solid.}

<D>__{roger.}
<A>__{jim swings; the window shatters. almost simultaneously there is a click and the door to the closet swings open. as jim turns with a sense of accomplishment, his face falls as he and the others see that the erratic door has opened.}
