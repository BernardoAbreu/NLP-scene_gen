<A>__{the hostages have been cut free from each other and sit against the wall. roger cradles the betacam in his lap, rocking slowly as if in a trance, while scagnetti feebly splints his broken fingers with the tape that hangs from his wrists. wayne is standing, alert and ready for action. as for the two deputies, hostage deputy #1 sits in anger, tight lipped and stoic. the other, deputy duncan homolka is panicked and jumpy, one may never see a more nervous man. mickey and mallory stand over them with their weapons drawn.}
