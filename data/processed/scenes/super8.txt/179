<T>__{the thing passes the fireworks:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{go! you don't wanna be here, go!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{joe, what are you doing?}
<A>__{it keeps coming past the fireworks, amazingly backlit as it lumbers toward joe, desperately trying to stand ground:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we understand! we know how hard it's been! but not everyone is horrible!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{joe, shut up, it's gonna kill you!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you're gonna be okay now!}
<A>__{and it grabs joe and lifts him alice and cary scream as joe is being squeezed he looks into the glossy black eyes of this beast, which could kill him at any time but in this moment of fear comes something else. simple truth he whispers, shakily:}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{ i know bad things happen bad things happen, but you can still live. you can still live, you can still live, you're gonna be okay }
<A>__{just as we think the creature's gonna kill him: a distant mechanical tone the creature turns, acknowledging that sound then to joe again. it considers him. its eyes' covering peels away revealing huge, wet, vulnerable eyes. and the thing looks at him. really looks at him. in a way, as you imagine his mother once had. and joe feels this too. and after a long, scary beat, the creature sets him down. joe backs up as the creature turns fast and speeds away. joe is stunned. shocked relief. alice and cary, too }
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{okay, wait a minute, what?!}
<A>__{then, over the high pitched mechanical sound comes rumblings like thunder from above and the three look up }
