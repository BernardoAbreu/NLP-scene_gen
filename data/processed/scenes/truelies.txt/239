<L>__{interior warehouse night}
<A>__{malik leads the entourage into the warehouse, where brilliant floodlights illuminate three huge stone figures, lined up in the middle of the space. the tarp is removes from the object they just unloaded, revealing a fourth statue. the figures are cracked and obscured by centuries, but they are unmistakably warriors mounted on horseback. the legs and arms are missing on some, but the massive heads and necks remain.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{incredible, aren't they? warrior figures from the persian empire of darius the first, around 500 bc. i call them "the four horsemen".}
<A>__{she approaches the nearest figure, caressing its flank. a man with a jackhammer steps up to her.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{they're absolutely priceless.}
<A>__{she shrugs and nods to the man with the jackhammer. he blasts right into the body of one of the horseman, destroying it. stone fragments fall away, revealing a cavity cut with great precision inside the figure. inside is a bright metal container. four terrorists pull it out and set it on the ground. it is six feet long and coffin like. malik steps up to it, his eyes glistening. a hush has fallen over the group.}
<C>__{malik}
<D>__{open it.}
<A>__{the latches are released and the lid lifted. inside is machined metal object, roughly conical, about five feet long. malik signals to harry to step closer and look.}
<C>__{malik}
<D>__{do you know what this is?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{can you give me a clue? it could be a water heater for all i know.}
<A>__{malik grabs helen, jerking her roughly forward. he whips out a knife and inserts the point under helen's jaw, forcing her head back and drawing blood.}
<C>__{malik}
<D>__{do you know why you have been brought here?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{n no.}
<C>__{malik}
<D>__{so that this man can verify to the world that crimson jihad is now a nuclear power.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{how can harry do that? he's a salesman for chrissakes.}
<C>__{malik}
<D>__{if we were wrong about him... then the last thing you see will be your blood spraying in his face.}
<A>__{harry steps forward, his face grim.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{this is a soviet mirv six, from an ss 22n launch vehicle. the warhead contains 14.5 kilos of enriched uranium, with a plutonium trigger. the nominal yield is 10 kilotons.}
<P>__{(in arabic, subtitled)}
<D>__{release her and i will cooperate.}
<A>__{malik lowers the knife from her jaw. he turns away from her like she has ceased to exist and yells at the terrorists to remove the other weapons. jackhammers tear into the stone figures. helen is just staring at harry, her mouth open. he turns to her, not knowing what to say. he shrugs sheepishly.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what can i say? i'm a spy.}
<A>__{she just looks at him for a long time. she moves closer, staring and staring, letting it sink in. then she hauls off and slugs him right in the jaw so hard is almost knocks him down.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you bastard!! you lying son of a bitch!!}
<A>__{terrorists grabs her and restrain her. she starts to cry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm sorry, honey.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{don't call me honey! you don't ever get to call me honey again. you understand?! you pig!}
<A>__{juno looks at them both and laughs. she offers helen a tissue.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{here you go, dear.}
<A>__{nearby, akbar is going through the contents of helen's handbag and harry's wallet. he rips open the bottom stitching and pulls out the geo positioning transmitter.}
<C>__{akbar}
<D>__{abu! look at this!}
<A>__{malik looks at the tracker and then smashes it to the floor. helen looks at the crushed transmitter. she stares at harry with dawning realization.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you bugged me?!!}
<A>__{juno cracks up at this.}
