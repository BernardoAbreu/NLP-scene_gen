<A>__{a movie begins, shown on a piece of cloth tacked to a wall. it is a newsreel footage from world war one. the trenches. the boy goes up to the cloth screen and touches it gently, playing with his own shadow as men dash from foxholes across a muddy, body strewn field. the boy steps back and stares at the horror of real war; men sleeping in the muddy foxholes, make shift hospitals tend the dying. youths not much older than his holiness weep into their filthy, bloody hands. the old monk keeps his trembling hand on the noisy, hand operated, projector. tenzin gyatso slowly sits, cross legged, on the bare floor. war does not look good on film.}
