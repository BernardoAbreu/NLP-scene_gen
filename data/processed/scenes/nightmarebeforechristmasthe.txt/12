<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior cemetery. night later.}
<A>__{utterly dejected, sally crouches behind a tombstone. she hugs herself with her remaining arm. the sudden sound of someone approaching (o.s.) makes her freeze. she dares to peek over the top of the tombstone to see who it is it's jack. the sight of him immediately comforts her.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{oh... it's jack... look at him he's so alive... so happy... he's so filled with confidence he could teach the wolves to howl!}
<A>__{sally lets out a little whimper of self pity and collapses out of sight behind the tombstone to feel sorry for herself...}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{he'll never notice me. why would he? why should he?}
<A>__{sally hugs herself again as best she can with her one arm.}
<B>__{jack}
<A>__{makes his way past the markers and mausoleums. he looks around and, since sally is hidden behind the tombstone, he doesn't see anyone. he starts the long climb up cemetery ridge as he sings: >>>>> jack's lament}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there are few who'd deny, at what i do i am the best for my talents are renowned far and wide when it comes to surprises in the moon lit night, i excel without ever even trying. with the slightest little effort of my ghost like charms i have seen grown men give out a shriek with the wave of my hand, and a well placed moan, i have swept the very bravest off their feet.}
<A>__{jack pauses a moment, as if letting these facts settle in, then heaves a huge sigh and sags miserably. jack's ghost dog, zero, rises out of his grave, floats over to jack and circles around him. trying to comfort his beloved master, he drapes himself over jack's shoulder and lays a sympathetic head on him. hunched over with sorrow, jack drags his bones on up the desolate hill.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yet year after year, it's the same routine and i grow so weary of the sound of screams and i, jack, the pumpkin king! have grown so tired of the same old thing....}
<A>__{zero drifts sadly to the ground, and flattens faithfully beside his master only his shiny little jack o'lantern nose on the end of his pointy snout sticks up. jack tragically reaches the crest of the long hill. zero follows, dragging along the ground after him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh somewhere deep inside of these bones an emptiness began to grow there's something out there far from my home a longing that i've never known ... i've never known.}
<A>__{jack gazes hopelessly out over halloweenland. behind her tombstone, sally can't believe what she's hearing. she peeks, but hides again. she listens breathlessly as jack continues his soul searching.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm a master of fright, and a demon of light and i will scare you right out of your pants, boy to a guy in kentucky, i'm mister unlucky and i'm known throughout england and france, boy and since i am dead, i can take off my head to recite shakespearian quotations no animal or man can scream like i can with the fury of my recitations. but who here would ever understand that the pumpkin king with the skeleton grin would tire of his crown if they only understood he would give it all up if he only could ... if he only could}
<A>__{sally's heart goes out to jack. she had no idea he felt this way, no idea of his tragic side. she wants to show him that he's not as alone as he thinks, that she understands him. but she's timid should she come out from behind the tombstone? dare she dare? should she? shouldn't she?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, there's an empty place in my bones that calls out for something unknown the fame and praise, come year after year, does nothing for these empty tears ... these empty tears....}
<B>__{jack}
<A>__{heads off with zero, staggering away blind in his misery, while... sally, still crouched behind the tombstone, continues to debate with herself... jack has left the cemetery and disappeared from sight when she finally screws up her courage and pops up full of determination and shouts:}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{jack! i know you hardly know me, but }
<A>__{he isn't there to hear her... shocked and disappointed, sally's rag doll body goes floppy again. her voice gets high and tiny... then trails off, almost tearfully...}
<C>__{sally }
<D>__{ i feel the same way you do...}
<A>__{sally stares sadly into the empty spot jack so recently occupied, then turns and hobbles limply away. she stops at a weed choked and desiccated little herb garden set beside a cluster of tombstones at the edge of the graveyard. the herbs growing there are labelled: "henbane," "witch hazel," "deadly night shade." as best she can with her single arm, sally gathers fresh sprigs of deadly night shade.}
