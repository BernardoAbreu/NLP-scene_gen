<L>__{exterior security cart minutes later}
<A>__{the security cart trots along, passing students coming and going. dressed smartly in a campus security outfit, dewey maneuvers the cart across the campus grounds. sidney rides beside him, horrified as she listens to him.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{three hundred people watched? nobody did anything?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{they thought it was a publicity stunt.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{oh my god. how could it happen?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{they don't know. it was carefully planned. earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{it's a copycat killer i knew this would happen. that fucking movie.}
<A>__{the cart comes to a stop in front of a building.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{as of now, they don't see any relation. but they're checking it out. the state, special task force, fbi they're all here. they'll find the guy.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{yeah, right.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{look, sid, why don't you take off? disappear for a few days. i will come with you.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no. i will not crawl under a rock. this is a fucked up world and people kill people all the time. i will just get used to it.}
<A>__{dewey steps down off the security cart and helps sid off.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{nothing will happen to you. i promise.}
<A>__{sid's tough demeanor is cracking. she takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{that's why i'm here, right? we take care of each other. c'mon, i will walk you to class.}
<A>__{he starts off, for the first time, a severe limp is visible as his left leg drags behind him.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you go, it's all stairs, i can take it from here.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{don't worry...}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{dewey, i'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{just in case...}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no. this is nothing, dewey. i will be okay. go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo happy existence.}
<A>__{sidney reaches up and gives her pseudo brother a kiss, then takes off for the building. dewey watches until she disappears inside, then limps back to his security cart.}
