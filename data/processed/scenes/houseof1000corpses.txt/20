<L>__{interior spaulding's restroom night}
<A>__{the restroom is gray, dingy, a single exposed light bulb hangs from the ceiling. the peeling walls are plastered with newspaper clippings and faded photos. mary is in the stall, sitting on the toilet, staring straight ahead at a poster of rhondo hatton, a b movie actor that suffered from acromegalia. denise standing at a tiny sink, splashes water on her face. she looks at herself in the mirror.}
<C>__{denise}
<P>__{(water running down her face)}
<D>__{i swear i've aged five years since this trip started.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<C>__{denise}
<P>__{(takes a paper towel and wipes her face)}
<D>__{god, i hate falling asleep in the afternoon. now i will be up all night...}
<P>__{(stretches)}
<D>__{...ugh, my back is killing me.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your dad's?}
<A>__{mary flushes the toilet and exits the stall.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{i don't know. couple hours i think. i've got to call him.}
<A>__{mary washes her hands. denise ties up her hair.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. this trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{yeah, i hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. watching her dance around with those ratty looking animals was ridiculous.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i know, that was some crazy shit. i never in a million years would have believed it if i hadn't seen it.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{a decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{if i never eat at another waffle house again, i can die a happy girl.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{scattered, smothered and covered.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{exactly... well, i guess a couple more photos won't kill me.}
