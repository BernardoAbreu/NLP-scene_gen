<A>__{he looks at crawford: reading amused, thoughtful.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{this man is a mechanical engineer with expertise in air crashes! he has access to airfields and he knows exactly how to make it look like an accident! you know what he did! you know why she's like this!}
<A>__{lunt hesitates, feeling a tiny edge of doubt. crawford checks his watch. looks into willy's eyes then gestures for willy to join him, and turns back to walk across the pad to the helicopter. climbs in. willy stares, stunned. lunt looks at him: case closed. the rotors whirl faster, engine noise rising to a scream. from the open chopper doorway, crawford looks at willy again and gestures for him to get on. willy doesn't know how to react. slowly, he starts to walk toward the helicopter.}
