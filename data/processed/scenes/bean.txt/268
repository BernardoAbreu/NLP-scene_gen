<A>__{bean has let himself into the car. it's one of the happiest moments of his life, as he inspects the gleaming panel and sits back in the gorgeous leather seat. he starts the car up and heads up into the circular car park. he sweeps dangerously round a few turns but just manages to keep the car in tact. finally he reaches the top floor where there is one quite small space left. bean is a good driver in a car that is, unfortunately, one foot wider than the one he's used to. he takes out the comb he always used to measure space with his mini, and measures the space. yes. seems large enough. he moves the car in. it isn't large enough. with a hideous scraping of metal against metal, the rolls royce squeezes in between the two cars, losing its wing mirror and door handle in the process. bean looks a tadge concerned.}
