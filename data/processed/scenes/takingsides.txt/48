<D>__{you'll see ruins, you'll see flowers, you'll see some mighty pretty scenery, don't let it fool you. you are in enemy country. the nazi party may be gone, but nazi thinking, nazi training and nazi trickery remain. somewhere in this germany are two million ex nazi officials. out of power but still in there and thinking, thinking about next time. remember that only yesterday every business, every profession was part of hitler's system. practically every german was part of the nazi network. they believed they were born to be masters. don't argue with them. you are not being sent germany as educators. you're a soldier on guard. you will observe their local laws, respect their costumes and religion and you will respect their property rights. you will not be friendly. you will be aloof, watchful and suspicious.}
