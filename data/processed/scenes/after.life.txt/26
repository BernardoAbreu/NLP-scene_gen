<L>__{interior mother's house. hallway day}
<A>__{anna closes the front door behind her. she smiles as she catches her reflection in the hallway mirror. her hair a dark vibrant red. just then, from another room, we hear an old woman's hacking cough.}
<C>__{old woman }
<D>__{anna? is that you?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes mother.}
<L>__{interior mother's house. bedroom moments later}
<A>__{anna's mother, beatrice (50s), sits in bed, knitting with swift, violent precision. the bedside table's stacked with medication. she's clearly been bed ridden for some time. an electric wheelchair in the corner of the room. anna appears at the door. beatrice scrutinizes her for a second. then returns to her knitting.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{terrible color.}
<A>__{anna moves to the beside table. picks up a dirty plate.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{can i get you something to eat?}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{i'm not hungry.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you have to eat.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{i don't have to do anything.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{the doctor said }
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{the doctor's an idiot. he doesn't know what he's talking about.}
<A>__{anna sighs. trying hard not to let her mother provoke her. beatrice glances up. anna avoids her look.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{why did you do it? today of all days.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what have i done wrong this time?}
<A>__{anna goes to the window. draws back the curtains.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{you've forgotten haven't you?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no i haven't forgotten. the service isn't till six.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{then you've got plenty of time to wash it out.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's permanent. you can't wash it out.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{then dye it back. you can't show up at the funeral looking like that. like some prostitute.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't look }
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{don't argue with me. why are you constantly arguing with me?}
<A>__{anna bites her tongue. heads to the door.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{to do the washing up.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{the sheets need changing. they haven't been changed in months.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i changed them monday.}
<A>__{anna goes to the cupboard. takes out clean sheets.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{you weren't here monday. you never sleep at home anymore. what if something happened to me in the middle of the night?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{nothing is going to happen to you. anyway diane }
<C>__{beatrice}
<P>__{(snorts)}
<D>__{fat lot of good she is. i wouldn't have to pay for a nurse if my only daughter wasn't living in sin with that lawyer of hers. doing god knows what. they always leave you in the end. you'll see. just like your father }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that's enough mother!}
<A>__{anna dumps the sheets on the bed. as she turns to leave beatrice's hand darts out and grabs anna's wrist.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{that's it. go and cry to paul.}
<A>__{anna pulls herself free. moves to the door.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{go and bitch to paul about your mean old mother.}
