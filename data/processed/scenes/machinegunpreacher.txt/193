<L>__{exterior dorm children's orphanage day later}
<A>__{hours later and we see sam pushing a couple of the smaller children on the swingset. deng approaches...}
<C>__{deng}
<D>__{some of the child soldiers say there is a bounty on your life. that kony is offering money for your nose and ears.}
<A>__{sam, no reaction, just keeps swinging the children...}
<C>__{deng }
<D>__{i'd like to assign a few more men to you during the day.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he ain't the first old boy who wanted to see my head hanging on his wall. keep yer soldiers where they're needed. i can take care of myself.}
<A>__{deng clearly worried for his friend, but doesn't press the issue. and now sam notices william off from the group, sitting on the ground by himself, not playing.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{he said anything yet?}
<C>__{deng}
<D>__{all we know is that his family was killed and that he and his brother were taken into the lra.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{where's the brother?}
<C>__{deng}
<D>__{nobody knows.}
<C>__{new angle}
<A>__{sam approaching william, kneeling down next to him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hey buddy, you don't wanna play with the other kids?}
<A>__{william, no response.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{you know sometimes it helps to tell somebody what you got locked up inside, know what i mean?}
<A>__{william, no reaction whatsoever. something dawning on sam in this moment...}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{you have no idea what i'm sayin, do you?}
<A>__{william just stares back at him and sam realizes he doesn't speak english. and they both just sit here for a moment, silent, staring at the children playing on the playground. and then sam, feeling the need to unburden himself, begins to talk...}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i done a lotta things i ain't proud of. hurt a lotta people. truth is, helpin you kids is about the only good thing i ever done in this life.}
<A>__{william watching him quietly.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{but i'm scared. scared one day i will close my eyes to all this and make it somebody else's problem.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just like everybody else in this world.}
<A>__{and he stops and it's silent between them again. william just sitting there quietly. and sam looks up to the sky... feeling his life washing over him... his burden... this fear.}
