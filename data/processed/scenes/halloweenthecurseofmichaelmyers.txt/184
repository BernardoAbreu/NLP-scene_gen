<L>__{interior cell night}
<A>__{a tight, damp, claustrophobic space. tommy is strapped upright to a crude metal rack, not unlike the one jamie was bound to the night before. feverishly he rubs his wrists against a jagged metal edge, cutting through skin, wearing away his bonds. breaking through.}
<L>__{interior tunnels night (continuous)}
<A>__{a group of white coats, led by wynn, usher loomis off an old service elevator, leading him through the dark passageway. wynn turns around, surveying the tunnel. as he walks on, we see something fall from his back pocket. as they disappear down another tunnel, a wooden door slowly creaks open. tommy appears, cautiously stepping out into the catacombs. edging along the dank, torch lit walls. wind moans. rats scamper past his feet. wynn has dropped his security key card. tommy swipes it.}
