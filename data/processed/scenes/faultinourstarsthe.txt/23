<L>__{ext int gus's house same}
<A>__{hazel follows gus inside. she quickly notices all sorts of engraved plaques and framed signs with phrases like "home is where the heart is" and "true love is born from hard times." hazel looks at gus quizzically.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{my parents call them "encouragements."}
<P>__{(rolling his eyes)}
<D>__{don't ask.}
<A>__{gus's mom and dad (40s) are in the kitchen making dinner.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hey guys.}
<C>__{gus's mom}
<D>__{augustus, hi. new friend?}
<A>__{gus's parents don't seem surprised to see gus with some random girl in their house. hazel takes note of that.}
<C>__{gus}

<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{it's just... hazel.}
<C>__{gus's dad}
<D>__{how's it going, just hazel?}
<C>__{gus}

<D>__{downstairs if you need us!}
<A>__{gus drags hazel to the next room. as she's pulled:}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{nice to meet you!}
<A>__{they walk down the carpeted stairs gus having an easier time with his one leg than hazel is with her oxygen tank and weak lungs. eventually they arrive at gus's basement bedroom. there's a tv with a video game console, a few band posters, and a whole host of basketball memorabilia (autographed sneakers, school trophies, framed images etc.) gus sees her looking at them.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i used to play.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{must have been pretty good.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{these are mine. and these. the rest of it's just cancer perks.}
<A>__{gus grabs a dvd from his stack of dvds. hazel sits down on the bed, her breathing noticeably heavier.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{need to sit.}
<A>__{gus sits down next to her on the bed.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{don't get any ideas.}
<P>__{(catching her breath)}
<D>__{all that standing... and stairs... and then more standing... lotta standing for me.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i will be fine in a minute. unless i fainterior i'm a bit of a victorian lady, fainting wise.}
<A>__{gus smiles. he waits for her breathing to slow down. in time:}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you ok?}
<A>__{hazel nods, smiles.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{so what's your story?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i already told you my story. i was diagnosed }
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{not your cancer story. your story. interests, hobbies, passions, weird fetishes...}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{um...}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{don't tell me you're one of those people who becomes their disease.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{no. i'm just... i don't know... un extraordinary.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i reject that out of hand.}
<P>__{(beat, hazel shrugs)}
<D>__{think of something you love. first thing that comes to mind.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{"an imperial affliction."}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{ok. what's that?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{it's a novel. my favorite novel.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{does it have zombies?}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{what? no.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{stormtroopers.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{seriously?}
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<D>__{it's not that kind of book.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{sounds horrible.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{it's not, it's... kind of my bible actually.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{interesting. what's it about?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{cancer.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{but not in that way, trust me. the guy who wrote it, peter van houten, he's... well, the only person i've}
<P>__{ever come across who seems to a)}
<D>__{understand what it's like to be dying and b) not have died.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(intrigued)}
<D>__{in that case... i am going to read this horrible book with the boring title that does not contain zombies or stormtroopers. and in exchange...}
<A>__{gus pulls a book from his bookshelf.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{... all i ask is that you read this brilliant and haunting novelization of my favorite video game.}
<A>__{hazel looks at the slim, ridiculous novella. she laughs. she's adorable when she laughs. she takes the book from him and as she does, their hands get tangled together for a brief, charged moment.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{your hands are cold.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{not so much cold as under oxygenated.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{ooh hazel grace...}
<P>__{(beat)}

<A>__{hazel blushes. and off her completely smitten smile, cut to:}
