<L>__{interior washington control room night}
<A>__{the washington control room. jennifer, jane, aaron, blair stand watching the intro to the central american piece. tom stands in the distant b.g. there are over a dozen monitors including one which is constantly on the anchor man, bill rorish.}
<B>__{on television monitors}
<A>__{bill rorish on camera an insert behind showing aaron in blackness planted into a central american map bordered by rifles. a separate monitor shows the insert alone.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{a fire fight along the nicaraguan border...in one minute.}
<A>__{the insert moves out at us to fill the screen we see aaron's dim outline and hear him say:}
<P>__{aaron (voice over; on camera)}
<D>__{the first shots were fired not thirty seconds ago.}
<A>__{the musical "evening news" signature comes in ever so briefly. the screen goes to a commercial as blair screams enthusiastically.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{great graphic, great graphic.}
<A>__{ernie enters the scene... he kisses jane in greeting pats aaron on the back.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{you finally got a piece in a few minutes early and i hear bill loved it.}
<A>__{jennifer gives jane a mock pat on the back.}
<C>__{ernie }
<D>__{i have somebody downstairs who one of the clerks brought in and vouches for. he says he has something to say about gays getting promotions at state... it can't hurt to tape him.}
<B>__{on jane}
<A>__{as she feels tom staring at her turns and notices him for the first time.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{how's it going?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{can i buy you dinner sometime soon?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(thrown)}
<D>__{i just got back i don't know which end is up.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{in the b.g. we may have noticed bill rorish on one monitor as he picks up the phone at his anchor desk, during the commercial break.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{jane! bill rorish wants to speak to you at the break.}
<P>__{(as she hands it to her)}
<D>__{i never heard of him handing over compliments in the middle of the show.}
<A>__{there is a stillness in the control room as jane speaks to the anchor man in new york who we can view on a monitor.}
<B>__{on monitor}
<A>__{we see bill rorish.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{jane?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{well, darling, if it gets any better than that, i'm going to have to bring you up here to new york.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{thanks. i just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.}
<A>__{blair cringes at jane's blunt reply.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{but thanks.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(over phone)}
<D>__{well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.}
<A>__{jane covers the mouthpiece and turns to aaron.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{god, he loved the boots.}
<A>__{aaron reaches happily for the phone.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{aaron should be hearing this so i have an extra witness.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(over phone)}
<D>__{well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{no, i don't. he happens to deserve the credit. he's right here.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(over phone)}
<D>__{i will speak to you soon}
<A>__{we see rorish over the monitor. he hangs up.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(to aaron)}
<D>__{he had to read over some new copy.}
<A>__{we see on the monitor that this is not so. it's a very eggy moment aaron. tom breaks the silence.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(to the rescue)}
<D>__{okay if i watch you tape that interview downstairs?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{as he passes jane he leans next to her and we hear him whisper.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{please laugh so they think i'm not dying inside but have so much style i just said something funny.}
<A>__{jane does her part enormously well laughing with amusement... but her eyes blaze her friend has been needlessly humiliated. blair wants desperately to be inside aaron's joke.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(as if still amused)}
<D>__{i will never tell.}
