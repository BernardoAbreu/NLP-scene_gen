<L>__{interior jackie fox's club dusk}
<A>__{jackie's club looks like a set from a blaxploitation film. frank and teddy, led by a bodyguard, come past some turkey carcasses and other remnants of thanksgiving to where jackie and a couple friends cavort with some naked girls.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{frank. welcome.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we need to talk.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{great. girls, get out.}
<A>__{the girls gather their things and leave. frank wipes at a modern leather chair with his handkerchief, throws it away, sits. jackie lays out a couple lines, offers frank a rolled up hundred dollar straw. frank shakes his head, no thanks.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you talked to charlie. you want to hear more about my black coalition. let me explain it to you }
<A>__{but first, let me suck up a line of coke }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's not why i'm here.}
<P>__{(jackie glances up from the powder. no?)}
<D>__{everybody's happy, jackie. charlie, baz, the cops, the italians, everybody. everybody except you.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'm happy.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{then i don't understand. why do you have to take something that's perfectly good the way it is, and wreck it?}
<A>__{jackie doesn't seem to understand.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{brand names mean something, jackie. consumers rely on them to know what they're getting. they know the company isn't going to try to fool them with an inferior product. they buy a ford, they know they're gonna get a ford.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{not a fuckin datsun.}
<P>__{(his look says, right?)}
<D>__{blue magic is a brand name; as much a brand name as pepsi. i own it. i stand behind it. i guarantee it and people know that even if they don't know me any more than they know the chairman of general foods.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what the fuck are you talking about, frank?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what you're doing, as far as i'm concerned, when you chop my dope down to five percent, is trademark infringement.}
<A>__{that. that's what this is about. jackie nods, but }
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{with all due respect, frank, if i buy something, i can do whatever i want with it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's not true. that's where you're wrong.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{if i buy a car, i can paint it, god damn it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jackie, you don't need to. you don't need to make more money than you can with blue the way it is. no one does. at a certain point it's just greed.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what do you want, frank? you want me to call it something else?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i have to insist. you call it blue magic, that's misrepresentation.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{fine. i will call it red magic, even though it doesn't sound as good.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's all i'm saying. wrap it in red cellophane and }
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{pink magic. black magic }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{whack it down to nothing, tie a bow around it and call it blue dogshit if you want, just don't let me catch you doing this again.}
<A>__{jackie regards frank for a long moment ...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{catch me? insist? infringement? i don't like these words as much as please thank you sorry to bother you, jackie. these are better words to use you come into my place without an invitation.}
<A>__{jackie waits to hear a kinder word but frank doesn't offer one. jackie nods, fine, okay, but it's more like a warning.}
