<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{come on, you motherfucker!}
<L>__{exterior dillon day}
<A>__{moving through the underbrush hears a slight rustling in the foliage. mac? he strains to locate the source of the movement. he hears a sound, too faint at first it identify. he listens. silence. he hears is again, the sound of a voice, barely audible. a very quiet whisper.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{dillon, over here.}
<A>__{dillon locates the direction of the voice and moves towards it.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(o.s.; barely audible)}
<D>__{dillon, over here.}
<A>__{dillon moves a few feet into the undergrowth. he carefully parts the thick leaves and vines and enters a tiny opening. he looks around, seeing nothing.}
<C>__{dillon}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{mac?}
<A>__{suddenly a hand appears and covers dillon's mouth. dillon gasps as mac pulls him down to where he is hiding.}
<C>__{mac}
<P>__{(whispering; close)}
<D>__{out there. past the rocks... can you see it?}
<A>__{something seems to move in the direction mac is pointing.}
<C>__{dillon}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i see it!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we're gonna take this thing.}
<A>__{dillon points to an outcropping of rocks, covered with}
<B>__{vines.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{take a position over there. i will work around towards you. when i flush him, you nail him...}
<C>__{mac}
<P>__{(a mean look)}
<D>__{...right, i got a score to settle for the bro...}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{we both got scores to settle.}
<A>__{dillon silently disappears into the jungle, mac watching him go. mac makes his way toward the rock outcropping, working his way between the rocks and the vines. he takes up a position and scans the jungle before him.}
<B>__{dillon}
<A>__{moving quietly, his face intense, determined. he stops and listens. mac rock outcropping straining to hear vague sounds coming from the jungle. he reaches out and grabs a vine and carefully pulls himself forward into a better position. back to scene dillon moving, searching. he goes into a crouch. mac rock outcropping there is movement in the undergrowth. he begins to sweat. he moves the safety to fire; reaches out and grabs another vine to pull himself forward. mac reacts in shock. the vine is alive! before he can move, the hunter's hand appears from the vines, grabbing mac by the wrist. in the moment before he is killed, mac turns and sees the hunter's glowing eyes. a flash as the hunter's other hand, moves with blinding speed, mac's face contorting in pain as the hunter's razor sharp spur rips deep into his throat. he falls forward into the leaves.}
<B>__{dillon}
<A>__{he hears the faint disturbance in the leaves. he pauses, turning in mac's direction, listening. hearing no further sound he relaxes, moving on.}
