<L>__{interior katie's car moments later}
<A>__{adam is seated in the front seat as katie drives. the car is filthy it's littered with papers, magazines, food wrappers, etc. katie's body is pressed all the way up against the steering wheel with her eyes fixed on the road.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{sorry about the mess.}
<A>__{adam picks up a copy of "organizing your way to success," which is lying on the floor.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i think you should ask for a refund.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i know, i know. what can i say? i'm not good at getting rid of things. i get easily attached.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yeah, i can see.}
<A>__{changing the subject.}

<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{it's true.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{but, i thought you can re take the test.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{eh. let's just say, that the state of california felt it was best i didn't.}
<A>__{katie stares at adam in shock.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i kind of backed my mom's car down an embankment...into the balboa cactus garden.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{the garden with all the endangered plants?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{they didn't want to tow it out in fear of destroying more of the vegetation, so they had to use a giant crane.}
<A>__{katie lets out a tiny chuckle, but quickly contains herself.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i'm sorry. that's terrible.}
<A>__{unable to hold back, katie continues laughing. this is the first time we've seen katie let go of her rigid nature.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(abrupt)}
<D>__{stop the car.}
<A>__{katie looks at adam nervously.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{why what's wrong?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{just stop the car.}
<A>__{katie stops the car. adam grabs a handful of katie's garbage and gets out.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i can't handle all this mess.}
<A>__{adam tosses the garbage in a dumpster and comes back to the car for more. katie starts laughing, she can't believe adam is cleaning her car.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{wait, no, not that, that's my dinner.}
<A>__{adam leaves katie's dinner and throws out the rest of the garbage. he gets back in the car and takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{you can drive.}
