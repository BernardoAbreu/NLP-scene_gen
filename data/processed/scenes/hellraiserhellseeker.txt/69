<L>__{exterior sage's building night}
<A>__{trevor is out of breath as he walks up to the last resort. the entrance to sage's building. the front door is locked. he presses a three digit code on the alarm box. ring. ring. the phone picks up. he's deperate.}
<C>__{sage's voice}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{sage it's me trevor. you've got to help me.}
<L>__{interior sage's office night}
<A>__{trevor's head hits the pillow on the acupuncture table.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{the feeling is very distinct. it's like somebody stuck a shard of glass through my eye and it's embedded halfway into my brain.}
<A>__{sage nods, patient look on her face.}
<C>__{sage}
<D>__{trevor your body has been completely healed. all the nerve endings have repaired themselves. if there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.}
<C>__{sage}
<D>__{you are physically better. it's your soul that still hurts.}
<A>__{sage grabs a bunch of needles from the table.}
<C>__{sage }
<D>__{my teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. so that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{look, whatever your marharagi, told you, forget. you've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.}
<C>__{sage}
<D>__{it was an analogy. your soul is locked up inside you. you need to free it trevor. you've blocked it from the healing process. that's what we need to do now. heal your soul. and to do that i you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. do you know what i mean by giving in? it's about trust. do you trust me implicitly?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i don't even know what's real and what isn't how can i trust anyone?}
<C>__{sage}
<D>__{you can trust me. your wife is dead and you need to move past that. and the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. surrender yourself to your wife's death. let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. it's the only way you can become whole again.}
<A>__{sage looks trevor dead in the eye.}
<C>__{sage }
<D>__{are you ready?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i surrender...}
<A>__{trevor closes his eyes}
<B>__{a montage}
<A>__{of sage dimming the lights so that the room is nice and dark... placing needles into trevor's body... his shoulders... his chest... his neck... his legs... his face... trevor finally opens his eyes to find... ... he's completely naked on sage's table! and she's making love to his body, which is now filled with needles!}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{wait... what the hell is this...}
<C>__{sage}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{surrender yourself... surrender yourself...}
<A>__{she holds up a small chunk of ice and begins rubbing it on trevor's chest. he catches his breath at the cold and begins to shiver.}
