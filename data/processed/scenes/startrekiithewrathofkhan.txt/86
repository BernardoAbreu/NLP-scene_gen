<A>__{kirk, wearing his spectacles, studies the transporter consoles. angle widens to reveal the transporter pods, and the others, b.g.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{did he make it down here?}
<A>__{chekov and terrell look at each other; they seem a bit stronger.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{it was not my impression. he spent most of his time trying to wring the information out of the people.}
<A>__{saavik approaches kirk:}
<C>__{saavik}
<D>__{anything?}
<A>__{kirk looks at her over the rims of the glasses:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{somebody left the unit on. if everyone else was dead, it implies that no one remained to turn it off. those people back there bought escape time for genesis with their lives.}
<A>__{saavik studies the console.}
<C>__{saavik}
<D>__{it doesn't make sense. these coordinates are well within regula a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(wheels turn)}
<D>__{if stage two was completed, it was underground she said it was going to be underground.}
<C>__{saavik}
<D>__{stage two of what?}
<A>__{kirk gets it.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(on communicator)}
<D>__{kirk to enterprise. damage report, spock?}
<C>__{spock's voice}
<D>__{admiral, if we go by the book, like lieutenant saavik, hours could seem like days.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i read you, captain. let's have it.}
<A>__{fractional pause.}
<C>__{spock's voice}
<D>__{the situation is grave, admiral. we won't have main power for six days at least. auxiliary power has temporarily failed, but maybe we can restore that in two days . by the book, admiral.}
<A>__{kirk frowns.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{meaning you can't even beam us back?}
<C>__{spock's voice}
<D>__{not at present.}
<A>__{kirk looks at saavik and bones, decides }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{captain spock, if you do not hear from us within one hour your orders are to restore what power you can, take the enterprise to the nearest star base and alert starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.}
<C>__{uhura's voice}
<D>__{sir we won't leave you behind...!}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. kirk out.}
<P>__{(to terrell and chekov)}
<D>__{you gentleman can remain here, or...}
<C>__{terrell}
<D>__{if it's all the same, admiral, we'd like to share the risk.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{very well. let's go.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{go where are we going?}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(points to console)}
<D>__{where they went. saavik.}
<A>__{kirk walks onto the pods as saavik works the console, rolling in electronic coding. the others join kirk.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{but what if they went nowhere?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.}
<C>__{saavik}
<D>__{ready.}
<A>__{she presses a button, joins them on the pods. slowly they vanish.}
