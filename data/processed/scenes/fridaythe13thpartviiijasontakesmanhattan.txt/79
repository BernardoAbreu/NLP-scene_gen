<D>__{i demand to know what is going on...}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{oh dear god...}
<A>__{she's seen the bodies. mcculloch follows her glance, paling. he quickly takes charge, pushing through the students.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{where's the radio?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{it's...dead.}
<C>__{deck hand }
<D>__{you're all going to die.}
<A>__{all heads spin as the deranged deck hand treads out from a shadowy corridor.}
<C>__{deck hand}
<D>__{you're the last ones. he's come back for you.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{the deck hand takes a final swig from his flask, dropping it with unsteady hands.}

<D>__{jason voorhees.}
<A>__{there is a collective, disconcerting silence triggered by the infamous name.}
<C>__{mcculloch}

<D>__{a killer walks this ship indeed. and it's certainly none of us...}
<A>__{the crazed old man gets his drift. everyone looks at him suspiciously. mcculloch grabs a scaling knife off the wall, taking a step towards him.}
<C>__{deck hand}
<D>__{you're the one who's insane!!}
<A>__{the raving man flees back the way he came. mcculloch raises the flare gun; miss van deusen grabs mcculloch's arm, stopping him.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{what are you doing??}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{that lunatic has been spouting off about jason since we boarded...}
