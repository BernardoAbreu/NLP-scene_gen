<L>__{interior hovercraft}
<A>__{like a sleepwalker, neo follows morpheus through the ship.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{this is my ship, the nebuchadnezzar. it's a hovercraft. small like a submarine. it's dark. it's cramped and cold. but it's home.}
<A>__{they climb a ladder up to the main deck.}
<L>__{interior main deck}
<A>__{everyone is there.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{this is the main deck. you know most of my crew.}
<A>__{trinity smiles and nods.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{the ones you don't know. that's mouse and switch. the two big guys are tank and dozer.}
<A>__{the names and faces wash meaninglessly over neo.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{and this, this is the core. this is where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the matrix.}
<A>__{it is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment. vines of coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic battery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks of little systems and computer monitors. at the center of the web, there are six ectoskeleton chairs made of a poly alloy frame and suspension harness. near the circle of chairs is the control console and operator's station where the network is monitored.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{help him, trinity.}
<A>__{neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{do you remember when i asked you about an apparatus that could turn a virtual reality into reality?}
<A>__{neo nods.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{it's right here.}
<A>__{he touches neo's head.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{and it's accessed here.}
<A>__{neo feels morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack at the back of his neck. the cable has the same kind of cerebellum chip we saw inside the plant.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{this will feel a little weird.}
<A>__{there are several disturbing noises as he works the needle in. we move in as neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens into a grimace until a loud click fires and his ears pop like when you equalize them underwater. he relaxes, opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling of weightlessness inside another place }
