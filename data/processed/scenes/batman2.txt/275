<A>__{batman pauses outside the door to the armory, which is slightly ajar. he pushes it in cautiously... ...and a halberd smashes through the wood frame slicing down mere inches from his face. it's the penguin wielding the ax; he backs off in seeming terror as batman advances on him. but then selina springs down from a perch above the doors landing on his back and the two of them are going at it again. it's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a good workout in the next thirty seconds. batman dodges a lance which embeds itself into the wall behind him, quivering and swings a mace squarely into selina's ribs. it's a crippling blow; she flies backward, knocking over a suit of exotic armor which topples, knocking over another and another until the various suits of armor have all fallen over, domino style the last of them landing squarely atop the cowering penguin. selina is badly hurt now. she makes it out of a rear door to the armory. batman pauses to check on the penguin he seems to be out for the count and sets off in pursuit of selina. several moments pass before the groaning penguin comes around enough to dig himself out.}
