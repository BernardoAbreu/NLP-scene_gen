<L>__{interior v.f.w. post main hall day}
<A>__{the meal is over. the women are drinking coffee, the men are smoking and putting down the beer. there is muted laughter and conversation. nick sits at the head of one of the tables, flanked by linda and sal. he looks stunned. his food is untouched, there are tears in his eyes and he hardly seems to know where he is.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{eat something, nick. eat a piece of toast.}
<A>__{nick nods, picks up a piece of toast and then, forgetting all about it, lays it absently on his plate. vince comes up behind nick, looking somewhat officious in a new blue suit.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{you want to say a few words, nick? i think you should. like that would wind things up.}
<A>__{nick nods. vince raps on a glass.}
<C>__{vince }
<D>__{quiet!... quiet!!!... awright, everybody, nick has a few words.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(very shaky)}
<D>__{i just... would like to say a few words... about merle. i guess merle always wanted something... i don't know... better. that fucking guy, he saved my life. he saved sal's... what merle liked, he liked things right... but then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.}
<A>__{tears are streaming down nick's face and he sits down, looking miserable.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(hisses)}
<D>__{john! play something!}
<A>__{john goes to the piano, hurried along by vince. he sits down, casts a quick glance to the ceiling and begins playing "america the beautiful". a few voices being singing. others join in. albert stands up. then everyone stands up.}
<C>__{the end}
