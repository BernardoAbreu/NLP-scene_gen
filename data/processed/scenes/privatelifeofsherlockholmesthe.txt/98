<L>__{interior dungeon night}
<A>__{a high ceilinged rock chamber, with a spiral iron staircase leading down. the floor is a concrete ramp, the lower end of it covered with water. beyond is the entrance from the loch, camouflaged by scaffolding and vegetation. on the upper part of the ramp is a small, primitive submarine, resting on wheels. prominently lettered on the bow is the name h.m.s. jonah, and suspended by a rope from the prow is the magnum of champagne which holmes delivered. along the sides are torpedo tubes, and fitted over the conning tower is the head and neck of the "monster" we saw in the lake. present are half a dozen naval personnel, commanded by an officer. as the royal party comes down the spiral staircase, the officer snaps to attention. mycroft is in the lead, followed by the queen, holmes, the lady in waiting, the equerry and the scientists.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{there she, ma'am. her majesty's ship jonah.}
<A>__{the four surviving midgets appear on the deck, in wool jerseys and navy caps. they start pulling on a chain which slowly raises the detachable head and neck of the monster toward the ceiling, disclosing the conning tower and the periscope.}
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{and what, may we ask, is the purpose of that hideous gargoyle?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{it's merely a decoy, ma'am.}
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{oh. to frighten away the sharks, we imagine.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{something of the sort... the crew will now demonstrate the workings of the submersible.}
<A>__{a sailor of normal height appears on the deck of the sub.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{stand to.}
<A>__{the midgets scramble down the hatch.}
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{aren't they rather small for sailors?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{they are. but because of the size of the craft, the navy made an exception.}
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{they should make it a rule. it's quite fatiguing to pin on all those medals while standing on our toes.}
<A>__{there is the sound of the engines starting. mycroft leads the queen to an open bulkhead in the side of the sub, with holmes and rest of the party close behind. inside, all is noise and confusion. metal rods are dipping into glass jars of sulphuric acid, complicated machinery is driving the propeller shaft, bellows are inflating and deflating, etc. the midgets are at their stations in the cramped quarters, pulling switches, oiling the engines, operating the periscope. overhead is a cageful of canaries, all chirping away. mycroft points out the various features to the queen.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{this is the main engine, which propels it under water at the rate of two knots the stabilizing mechanism the multi stage compressor the ballast tank trimmer the air pump which filters and recirculates the air }
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{how charming.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{the air pump, ma'am?}
<C>__{queen victoria}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{the canaries. must make the crew feel at home.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{yes, ma'am. these are the levers for firing the torpedoes, which are accurate up to as much as 120 feet the periscope for scanning the surface of the water }
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{but where is the glass bottom?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{the what, ma'am?}
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{the glass bottom.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you know to see the fist }
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{ and the plants and the corals }
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{that's not quite the idea, ma'am. h.m.s. jonah is being commissioned as a warship.}
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{a warship?}
<P>__{(waving her hand)}
<D>__{stop that noise. stop it!}
<A>__{at a signal from mycroft, the sub engines are turned off.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{ma'am, if i may explain }
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{you had better.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{the admiralty regards this craft as the ultimate weapon in naval warfare. it can seek out enemy ships and destroy them with these torpedoes while remaining completely invisible.}
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{you mean in can fire at other vessels while under water?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{without any warning?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{that is correct, ma'am.}
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{and without showing her colors?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{indeed, ma'am.}
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{mr. holmes, we are not amused.}
<P>__{(mycroft stares at her)}
<D>__{it is unsportsmanlike, it is un english, and it is in very poor taste. we will have none of it!}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{i beg your pardon, ma'am?}
<A>__{he exchanges a look with holmes.}
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{sometimes we despair of the state of the world. what will scientists think of next?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{that's precisely it, ma'am. at this very moment the germans under count von zeppelin, are experimenting with a dirigible }
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{a dirigible? and what, pray, is that?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{a rigid balloon, which could fly over london and drop a bomb on buckingham palace. it is being developed at the express orders of kaiser wilhelm the second.}
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{nonsense. we refuse to believe that our grandson willie would do a thing like that.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{we have conclusive proof, ma'am. our agent in friedrichshafen, a man named ibbetson, actually saw the dirigible, and made a drawing of it. unfortunately, he was apprehended before he could cross the border.}
<C>__{queen victoria}
<P>__{(indicating sub)}
<D>__{nevertheless, we don't want any part of this beastly invention. get rid of it! scuttle it! the sooner the better.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{may i point out, ma'am }
<C>__{queen victoria}
<D>__{and don't concern yourself about that dirigible dropping bombs on us. we shall write a very sharp note to the kaiser.}
<P>__{(to equerry)}
<D>__{now we wish to return to balmoral.}
<A>__{she starts toward the spiral staircase. the equerry precedes her up the stairs, the lady in waiting follows, the scientists trail after them. mycroft and holmes linger behind.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{well, mycroft, it seems we have both been undone by a woman.}
<P>__{(mycroft is staring at the sub)}
<D>__{what a shame. all that superb engineering, and all that cunning espionage, for nought.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{not necessarily. if the germans want that submersible so badly, why don't we give it to them?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{give it to them?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{invite them aboard for the final journey seven hundred feet straight down.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{and how are you going to arrange that?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{i'm rather counting on you to do it. since you are on such intimate terms with fraulein von hoffmanstal.}
<A>__{o.s., the bagpiper resumes playing.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{shall we say goodbye to her majesty?}
<A>__{he starts up the spiral staircase. holmes follows slowly and thoughtfully.}
