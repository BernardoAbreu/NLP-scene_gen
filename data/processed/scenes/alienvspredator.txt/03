<A>__{legend: present day dark void. for a moment, everything is totally black. then light begins to creep onto the screen. it slowly illuminates what seem to be giant black spider legs. they are almost metallic in appearance. for a moment, any fan would be forgiven in thinking that this was an alien queen. but as the light grows, we see that the legs belong to an orbiting satellite. we are in space. 50 miles above an unidentified planet. as the sun rises above the planet, it illuminates the globe, and we begin to see the familiar green and blue of earth. suddenly the camera races forward into the satellite. we streak through a complex web of circuitry, coming to rest at last by a large glass lens. the satellite is one giant camera aimed towards the earth. and it's taking photographs. we see the imagery, but very distorted. something on the surface of the earth far below a pattern of interlocking square shapes.}
