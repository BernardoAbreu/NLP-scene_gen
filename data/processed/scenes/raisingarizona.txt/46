<A>__{hi is seated in a straight back chair, still violently struggling but gale's arms are wrapped around him from behind. evelle is just finishing tying off his wrists behind the chair. no one talks; there is nothing left to say. finished, gale goes to the door and evelle goes to the bedroom. he emerges with the baby and precedes gale out the door, gale slamming it behind him. hi starts bucking and struggling, weeping tears of rage and frustration. he succeeds only in tipping forward, face down into the carpet, the strapped on chair pressing down on top of him. his profile is pressed into the carpet. offscreen we hear the door of the trailer opening. hi's pov at carpet level. gale's shoes enter his field of vision. they stride over to a mess of debris in the corner of the living room.}
