<L>__{interior finished house night}
<A>__{the humanoid figure walks rapidly down the hall into the kitchen. an indistinct image plays on the inside of its faceplate and we hear the faint sounds of a percussive language. through the window over the sink we can see the lights of the spaceship. the rockets flip into the humanoid's gloved hands and it is airborne out the open back door.}
<L>__{exterior housing tract night}
<A>__{from the road benny and the officer watch as the humanoid figure that just blasted over them flies between the trees and into the white light emitting from the underbelly of the spacecraft. the noise from the ship's power plant is deafening as it begins to rise above the trees. with mike at the wheel the police car, its rack lights flashing, fishtails up the dirt road and slides sideways to a bone jarring stop next to benny and the officer. as they jump out of the way they find themselves facing into the super white beam of the figure that was in the house. they are between it and the ship. at the angle that it is coming up the hill, the light looks like it is heading directly for them. this is too much for the officer and in terror he raises his shotgun and fires wildly at it. the figure veers off and disappears into the fog. with an awesome roar the spacecraft reaches escape velocity and hurtles into the night sky. the concussion waves knock benny and the officers off their feet.}
