<A>__{the council's voices still ringing in her head, taarna flies in over the demolished gates. below her, the once beautiful city lies in ruins. gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the town's center. as she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard on the reins, and heads her bird up. the camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome down to the council chambers below. corpses of the councilmen are strewn everywhere. in the center of the room, a large pile of ancient books and manuscripts lie smouldering. reaching the floor, taarna dismounts and starts to look around. at the head of the marble table sits the elder dead. in front of him, a roll of parchment lies on the table. taarna opens it. carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains, their tops glowing green. taarna looks at it, and puts it in her sack. then she notices that the elder is clutching something in his hand. prying his stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood stained medallion just like the one her attacker wore on his chain. looking at the dead elder, taarna grips the medallion tightly in her hand.}
