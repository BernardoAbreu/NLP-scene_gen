<L>__{exterior road (countryside) day}
<A>__{the plymouth drives along the two lane blacktop past the fields of tall, green corn. doug is driving, helen sits beside him. she reacts to something in the distance:}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{isn't that pamela abbott?}
<A>__{in the distance pamela struggles with a jack as she tries to remove a flat tire on her convertible. doug grimaces as he recognizes her.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it is pam. pull over.}
<A>__{doug reluctantly pulls over beside pam's car. she's no more pleased to see doug than he is to see her.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{hi, pam. do you need some help?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{hi, mrs. holt. it's so darn hot the stupid jack just keeps sinking into the pavement.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{well, maybe doug can give you a hand?}
<A>__{doug frowns and slowly climbs out of the plymouth.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{where's the thing that goes on the bottom of the jack?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{what thing?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{the thing, the base that the jack fits into?}
<P>__{(finds it in her open trunk)}
<D>__{this.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{oh, i thought that was just the 'spare tire holder on er.'}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{read your manual.}
<A>__{pamela would slug him if his mother wasn't present. doug releases the load on the jack and strains to extract it from the molten pavement.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{pam, would you mind running doug home? i'd like to get to the bank before they close.}
<C>__{doug}
<P>__{(protesting)}
<D>__{mom...}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{sure, mrs. holt, i will drive him home. thanks for stopping.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{of course. bye bye.}
<A>__{helen slides over behind the wheel and drives away. doug fumes silently while he reassembles the jack.}
