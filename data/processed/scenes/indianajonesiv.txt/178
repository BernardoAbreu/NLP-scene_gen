<A>__{the full moon illuminates the night sky. shimmering across the ocean waters. countless bright stars sparkle in the night sky. indy's ocean liner sails across the water. the image of an eagle appears in the night sky. silhouetted against the moon.}

<A>__{indiana jones is sound asleep in his bed. the room's porthole mysteriously swings open. the golden eagle flies inside. the eagle transforms back into the golden hooped rod. the rod leans against the wall. the moonlight reflects the rod, shining into indiana's eyes. indy wakes. he sits up and sees the golden hooped rod. at first, he is shocked. he touches the rod...then comes upon a realization. the creaky voice of sun wu kung fills the soundtrack.}

<A>__{indy stands. he turns and looks out of the porthole. a dreamy... satisfied smile covers indy's face, as he stares at the stars above. sound track music soars. camera pulls back, to extremely long shot of the ship sailing across the ocean.}
