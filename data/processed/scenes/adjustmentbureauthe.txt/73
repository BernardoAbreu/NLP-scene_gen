<A>__{it's the same apartment except it's bigger now. instead of two large windows on the park, his apartment is now six windows across. (he has bought the two one bedrooms next to his and knocked the walls down). three years have passed. no files on the table, like there were the last time we were here. david is on the phone in a new park view study.}
