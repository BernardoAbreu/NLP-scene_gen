<L>__{interior hospital emergency room night}
<A>__{brian shoulders his way through the emergency room. he passes a small alcove full of vending machines. adcox is there, sipping a paper cup, leaning against the machine in deep anguish.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{is he...}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{he's alive.}
<L>__{interior hospital icu night}
<A>__{further down the hall is icu. grindle and santos are there, sitting outside the room, raw and weary. grindle nods to brian. everyone's still stained and smudged from the fire. everyone but brian. brian looks through a door window into the room. there, surrounded by doctors and physicians, lies tim. he's been cut out of his uniform. gauze bandages everywhere. as a pair of forceps peel some away brian glimpses what used to be a face, now only reds and browns and leaky whites. he turns away.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{do they think he'll pull through?}
<C>__{grindle}
<D>__{they're not saying.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i should have been there.}
<C>__{nightengale}
<D>__{none of us should have been there, brian.}
<A>__{voices rise down the hall. turn to shouts. it's adcox and stephen, tearing heartbreakingly into one another. brian can't make out the words but it's ugly, emotional. abruptly it ends and stephen emerges from the alcove, walking toward them upset.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{you had to do it, didn't you?}
<A>__{stephen's got other things on his mind.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{...not now, brian.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{had to take on another fire bare handed, huh? had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. is that what happened? is it, stephen?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i had that fire. he didn't listen!}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{he didn't listen? he was a fucking candidate! he was your responsibility. he shouldn't have been there in the first place, stephen.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you burned him.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{brian grabs his arm. stephen snaps and roughly pushes brian, knocking him against the wall. brian comes off it in a flash and is all over stephen. they go down and it's all thrashing and shouting now. a horrible, endless draw. grindle and santos are in it, pulling them apart, holding them up against opposite walls. both brothers glare at one another, tears filling their eyes. brian shakes grindle off and walks away.}
