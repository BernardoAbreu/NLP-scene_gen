<L>__{interior house}
<A>__{an old rundown house. the clutter smells. whoever lived here had little to no self respect. garbage is piled up in every corner, order is nowhere. brent is repulsed by what he sees. he wasn't expecting such chaos. he knows he helped create this mess.}

<D>__{is there a picture of her somewhere?}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{no pictures. no mirrors. was she a crazy woman when you knew her?}

<D>__{no.}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?}

<D>__{i've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.}
<C>__{brent}

<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{yeah. you should check downstairs.}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{people always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. all the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.}
<A>__{the woman flips on the basement light. there are several locks on the door. brent is very scared of what he's going to find down there.}
