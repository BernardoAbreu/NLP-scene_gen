<L>__{interior lincoln's office, white house early evening}
<A>__{seward hands the last prospectus to nicolay, who unfolds it, places it on top of the other prospectuses, and records details about hawkins's appointment in a notebook. seward smokes a cigar, nicolay a pipe. lincoln sits, feet up, examining a newspaper.}
<C>__{seward}
<D>__{and lastly, democratic yes vote number six. hawkins from ohio.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{six.}
<C>__{seward}
<D>__{well, thus far. plus graylor's abstention. from tiny acorns and so on.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{what'd hawkins get?}
<C>__{john nicolay}
<P>__{(still writing:)}
<D>__{postmaster of the millersburg post office.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{he's selling himself cheap, ain't he?}
<C>__{seward}
<D>__{he wanted tax collector of the western reserve a first term congressman who couldn't manage re election, i felt it unseemly and they bargained him down to postmaster.}
<P>__{(to nicolay:)}
<D>__{scatter `em over several rounds of appointments, so no one notices. and burn this ledger, please, after you're done.}
<A>__{lincoln stands.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<P>__{(to nicolay:)}
<D>__{time for my public opinion bath. might as well let `em in.}
<A>__{nicolay helps lincoln trade his shawl for his overcoat in preparation to meet the public.}
<C>__{lincoln }
<D>__{seven yeses with mr. ellis! thirteen to go!}
<C>__{seward}
<D>__{one last item, an absurdity, but my associates report that among the representatives a fantastical rumor's bruited about, which i immediately disavowed, that you'd allowed bleary old preston blair to sojourn to richmond to invite jeff davis to send commissioners up to washington with a peace plan.}
<A>__{lincoln is silent. a horrifying reality dawns for seward:}
<C>__{seward }
<D>__{i, of course, told them you would never...not without consulting me, you wouldn't...because why on earth would you?}
