<L>__{exterior dirt path day}
<A>__{joey sits on the handle bars as todd pedals over the rugged terrain. joy looks scared, but appears to be enjoying the ride and the chance to be with his old friend. the next shot shows todd's bike laying on the ground. the wheels still turn slowly. the camera moves to reveal todd and joey standing on a rocky ledge. orange country sprawls out before them. under the cross hairs of a telescopic sight, a truck, from the freeway below, zooms out of frame. the image vanishes. we see joey looking through the scope which he holds in one hand.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{this is so cool.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{point it over here. that's the middle school. you can see right into our old class room.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{oh yeah... but i still don't see what you need the rest of it for. doesn't your dad notice?}
<A>__{the hunting rifle, disassembled, sticks out of todd's backpack on the ground.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{he hasn't yet.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{yet?... jesus, todd.}
<A>__{he is trying to joke, but the seriousness is clearly in his voice.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{and over here, that's your dad's office. and there's the old drive in.}
<A>__{joey isn't looking through the scope anymore. he holds it out to todd, watching him.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{here. take it.}
<A>__{todd grabs the scope. but joey doesn't let go. he finally locks todd in a stare that he has been avoiding for months. he wants to say something. todd takes the scope. he sees that joey is serious. he takes a few steps toward the edge, toward the gun. he looks out.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{it's such a rush, you know?... to be up here. don't you feel it? so high above them they never know we're here. it's like an ant farm. we're the gods on mt. olympus, joey. they can't see us, they can't hear us, but every so often we can make them feel us. just so they never forget. look...}
<A>__{he looks through the scope at the freeway. he picks out passing cars.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{there goes a future track star. there goes a judge. a mom and her two kids. a policeman. that one's a school teacher, that one's a drug dealer... you see, joey, it doesn't matter. it doesn't matter how smart you are ...or how many grades you skip. there's always someone who can take it all away. the right person snaps their fingers... and it's done.}
<A>__{joey takes a few steps backward. todd doesn't notice.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{todd, i'm gonna go. i'm gonna... walk home.}
<A>__{todd turns his head toward joey, but it is as though no one is there. he looks away again.}
<C>__{joey }
<D>__{todd...}
<A>__{pause. todd looks again. but this time joey is really gone. a slight chuckle escapes todd's mouth.}
