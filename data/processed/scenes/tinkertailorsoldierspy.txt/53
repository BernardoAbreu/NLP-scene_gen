<L>__{interior hotel islay smiley's room day}
<A>__{a large, faded floral monstrosity of a room. two single beds, a large leather chair, a wireless. smiley's new landlady mrs pope graham is supervising a gormless teenager norman who is struggling into the room with a rickety card table. mendel and guillam take it from him and set it into the room. from the next room comes the unmistakable sounds of someone having sex.}

<P>__{(re the table)}
<D>__{it's georgian, i shouldn't lend it to you but since mister mendel recommends you...}
<A>__{she gives the table a sentimental tap, raising her voice a little to drown out the excesses from the room next door.}
<C>__{mrs pope graham }
<D>__{you will love it for me won't you? it belonged to mister pope graham.}
<A>__{she glances at smiley who has his back to her looking out into the london street. smiley's p.o.v. ... looking out at rooftops opposite and a travel agents sign which reads the wide world.}
<C>__{mendel }
<D>__{my friend just wants peace and quiet in order to work, mrs pope graham, no disturbances.}
<C>__{mrs pope graham}
<D>__{and that's what he shall have. you want anything you can ask norman, can't he, norman?}
<A>__{and they leave. a small silence...}
<C>__{mendel}
<D>__{her real name is plain graham. added the pope for a touch of class.}
<A>__{guillam gives a grunt of amusement.}
<C>__{mendel }
<D>__{best informant i ever had.}
