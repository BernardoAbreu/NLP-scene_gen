<L>__{exterior front yard night}
<A>__{the sounds of the party drift out from the house as gideon, linda and babe brother talk.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{tell me, how come me and suzie have to be mother and father to your child? you never take the boy to the park, circus or anything. if we did not take him to church, he wouldn't have any sense of religion.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i think forcing him to go to church when he really doesn't understand is not saving his soul. when he gets old enough to make up his own mind about religion, that will be better. it will be his intellectual decision.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{is that the way your parents raised you?}
<C>__{babe brother}
<D>__{why, you don't want us to bring him over?}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{no, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? you guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. you are into yourselves, as the saying goes. spend some time trying to be parents. take him to the mountains, fishing. you ought to let him get to know nature.}
<C>__{babe brother}
<D>__{well, you are his grandfather. he is supposed to spend some time with you. you're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{junior spends time with his child.}
<C>__{babe brother}
<D>__{oh here we go with that.}
