<L>__{exterior harbor establishing day}
<A>__{only the faintest sign of daylight can be seen through a thick blanket of gray fog. in the distance, speckled lights outlining a smaller luxury cruise ship intermittently appear.}
<L>__{exterior dockside day}
<A>__{standing at the boarding ramp is charles mcculloch, clipboard in hand. he's just finished checking off a pair of new agey senior girls. mcculloch is approaching fifty, wearing a tie and unwrinkled clothes, as well as the disposition of a stern puritan.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{remember girls, the shuffleboard tournament will start at six p.m. sharp. a non attendance will restrict your time in port, understood?}
<A>__{they nod for his benefit, exchanging derogatory whispers as they head up the ramp. camera adjusts to find a small parking lot adjacent to the docks, where several cars are just now arriving parents dropping off their high school seniors, hugging them bon voyage.}
<B>__{closer angle parking lot}
<A>__{as sean robertson walks toward the ship with pal miles wolfe. sean's a tall, nice looking, somewhat serious guy; miles is shorter, athletic and more extroverted.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you're telling me this boat has a pool with a three meter board?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{it's a ship and that's right. plus a disco, gym, game room and a lot more.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i think i'm gonna blow off new york and just stay on this thing.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{you'll do no such thing, mr. wolfe...}
<A>__{camera adjusts to reveal mcculloch, holding his list, checking off their names.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{your itinerary has been carefully planned and make no mistake, it will be executed accordingly.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{of course...wouldn't want to risk enjoying this trip.}
<A>__{mcculloch gives him a frown. sean steps up to him tentatively.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{which cabin is rennie in, mr. mcculloch?}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{rennie's not coming.}
<A>__{he's devastated.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{but i thought...}
<C>__{mcculloch}

<P>__{(eyeing list)}
<D>__{let's see...mr. wolfe is in stateroom one eleven and you, mr. robertson, are in two twenty five.}
<A>__{a booming voice from above interrupts them:}
<C>__{admiral robertson }
<D>__{sean where the hell have you been? we're already into early departure protocol...}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{standing on the upper deck is a no nonsense, uniformed navy man, admiral robertson. the captain of the ship. and sean's father. sean's sadness about rennie's absence is immediately replaced with anxiety.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{be right up, dad.}
<A>__{he and miles head up the gangway, both boys giving mcculloch one last glare.}
