<L>__{interior bluff crack chimney}
<A>__{gabe has a quick climbing rhythm now. he pulls himself up with his hands, then braces his body with his back, and pulls himself up again he's not looking up, because he can't see anything yet anyway naturally, this leads to a head and rock collision. gabe's head crashes against a new part of the crack, as the passage thins out. he gropes up. the passage is narrowing to the point that he can't get through it. dead end.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{should've taken that left turn at albequerque.}
<A>__{gabe backs down, and starts to slide across the side. with his back wedged against the rear wall, he uses his feet to push against the forward wall. gabe's pov black zero visibility gabe can't see what he's shoving toward. there has never been light of any kind in here.}
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{blindly pushes to the side, rattled by the difficulty of doing this in the dark.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{it's just like any other side move you can't see where the fuck you're going, that's all }
<A>__{gabe stops and fishes out his penlight. turning it on, it's clear those batteries haven't gotten any more potent in the last few hours. gabe shines it to the side. gabe's pov the light is fading fast. a match's last gasp is brighter.}
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{exasperated, puts the penlight in his mouth and moves on.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(garbled)}
<D>__{much better.}
<A>__{gabe inches on to the side. looks up to see if the crack has gotten wider. it hasn't. gabe mumbles something phonetically near "motherfucker" around the flashlight, aiming it up gabe's pov up no opening larger than a mail slot }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{still cursing, still looking up, still moving to the side he gets the opening he wants, but not where he wants it the crack suddenly, drastically widens as he moves to the side since he's been bracing his back against the wall, gabe falls out of control, twisting around, face down gabe bounces down the walls for several yards and catches himself by bracing his arms and legs against the crack. it's now five feet wide as he painfully brakes himself gabe's pov the penlight falls out of gabe's mouth and tumbles down, ping ponging from one side of the crack to the other as it tumbles a long, long way down even after the light is gone, we can still hear the penlight's receding clattering against the walls }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{is now, literally, in a jam. there are no handholds, no ledges, and the walls are slick. all he can do is remain braced against the crack's walls until his already sore arms and legs give out.}
