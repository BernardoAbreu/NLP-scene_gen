<L>__{exterior yussef and ahmed's house day}
<D>__{hassan and abdullah's family are behind the house. hassan stands with the rifle in front of a rock some twenty yards away and he turns toward abdullah.}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{with this rifle, your sons will be able to kill plenty of jackals. he aims at the rock and pulls the trigger without holding the rifle properly. it is clear that he doesn't know how to fire a weapon, and the shot cracks loudly. the rifle kicks and hits him roughly in the shoulder. the bullet flies far wide of the rock. the women laugh nervously. rubbing his shoulder, hassan turns to abdullah.}
<C>__{hassan }
<D>__{let one of your sons shoot. abdullah looks at his boys and points at the younger one.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{let yussef shoot. when hassan is about to hand yussef the rifle, ahmed cuts him off, upset.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{i want to shoot first. father and son exchange an angry glance. hassan, without realizing it, turns and gives the rifle to ahmed. the boy grabs the gun: it is heavier than he thought.}
<C>__{hassan}
<D>__{look, load it like this. hassan opens the chamber, inserts the bullet and then closes it. once it is loaded, he points at the safety.}
<C>__{hassan }
<D>__{this is the safety. push it in when you're ready. ahmed nods. unsure of himself, he raises the rifle and, almost without aiming, fires. the shot kicks up dust far from the rock. his sisters laugh.}
<C>__{hassan }
<D>__{if he doesn't hit the jackals, at least he'll scare the shit out of them. ahmed lowers the rifle. his father grabs it and gives it to yussef enthusiastically.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{your turn. yussef grabs the rifle and loads it confidently. he lifts the rifle with ease and takes his time aiming. he seems innately skilled at the maneuver. he shoots and the bullet hits just below the rock. abdullah celebrates the shot and mockingly turns to hassan.}
<C>__{abdullah }
<D>__{now this kid shoots a hell of a lot better than you.}
