<A>__{the two p 40's drop out of the sky and bounce to a landing; anthony and red have been pushing the wreckage off the field with the buick. danny and rafe pull the p 40's behind the burning quonset hut, and it's like a pit stop at a race track; earl rushes up and starts fueling the planes, their engines still running.}

<D>__{we need ammo too!}
<A>__{earl shouts instructions to the pilots.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{strip it from the wrecks!}
<A>__{the other pilots race to the wrecked p 40's and start pulling out ammo belts. earl glares at the smoking engine of danny's plane, and the bullet holes.}

<D>__{who the fuck taught you to fly?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{he did.}
<A>__{earl looks at rafe's plane, more shot up and abused than danny's. rafe grins and waves to him. earl mumbles a stream of guttural and unintelligible obscenities. the zeros that followed them sweep down, strafing. one mechanic, running across the field with a belt of ammo, goes down. coma, running behind him, picks up the fallen man's ammo and his own, bringing both to the planes behind the hut. he, red, and anthony reload the machine guns in rafe and danny's planes. rafe and danny gun their engines and head back into the air, the grounded pilots firing a covering barrage and earl even coming up with a 12 gauge shotgun to fire at the zeros as they rush past.}
