<L>__{exterior bela's neighborhood day}
<A>__{ed drives past pumping oil wells and into a seedy neighborhood. they reach a tiny, well manicured house. ed and bela get out.}
<C>__{bela}
<P>__{(bitter)}
<D>__{they don't want the classic horror films anymore. today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers who would believe such nonsense!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{the old ones were much spookier. they had castles, full moons...}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{they were mythic . they had a poetry to them.}
<P>__{(he lowers his voice)}
<D>__{and you know what else? the women prefer the traditional monsters.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{the women ?}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{the pure horror, it both repels and attracts them. because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth. the blood. the blood is horror.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i never thought of that.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{take my word for it. you want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "dracula."}
<A>__{bela's eyes twinkle. he reaches his front door and unlocks it. inside... it's awful. squalid, dark, with skulls and strange voodoo objects scattered about. up front hangs a large photograph of shockingly young bela, handsome and regal. ed is stunned by this dismal place, but doesn't say anything. within, dogs start barking crazily.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{ugh, what a mess.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{my wife of twenty years left me last month. i'm not much of a housekeeper.}
<A>__{the dogs bark louder.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{shh! i'm coming! i will feed you!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{well... i guess i should go. perhaps we could get together again?}
<C>__{bela}
<P>__{(he shakes his hand)}
<D>__{certainly. but now the children of the night are calling me.}
<A>__{bela smiles and steps inside. the door closes.}
