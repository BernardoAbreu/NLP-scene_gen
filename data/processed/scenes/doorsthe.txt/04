<L>__{exterior arizona desert day (1940's)}
<A>__{the blinding yellowness of the desert, so barren, so hot it stings to look at. an old chevrolet winds through the yellow orange landscape beneath a brooding blue sky crackling with electricity the storm coming in in the distance as the music writhes out at us like a reptile from under a rock the beat of riders on the storm.}
<B>__{doors song}
<A>__{riders on the storm (2) into this house we're born into this world we're thrown like a dog without a bone an actor out on loan riders on the storm credits roll, over this dreamscape}

<P>__{(continues over imagery)}
<D>__{...me and my mother and father and grandmother and grandfather were driving through the desert at dawn and a truckload of indian workers had either hit another car or just i don't know what happened... indians were scattered all over the highway bleeding to death.}
