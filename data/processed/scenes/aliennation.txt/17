<L>__{exterior tunnel street night}
<A>__{sykes rounds this second corner, races down the street. the only route they could've taken is through a tunnel up ahead. sykes approaches the tunnel, all senses wide open.}
<L>__{interior tunnel night}
<A>__{the murkiness of the tunnel engulfs him as he moves through the mouth. he tries to control his breathing so he can hear. the only sound is his own shoes scuffing along the asphalt. then he hears another set of footsteps. rapid footsteps, coming toward him, echoing. he can't tell from which direction! he spins, just as a large shape lunges for him with an alien cry. it's the wired raincoat alien. sykes gets his gun up just in time and fires once, twice, three times. raincoat alien is knocked backwards to the wet asphalt by the blasts. sykes approaches the body slowly. with an inhuman roar, the alien snaps forward, lunging at sykes with outstretched arms. sykes jumps back, startled, and fires twice more at the pale figure. raincoat goes down and stays down. sykes relaxes for the briefest moment. then he hears it... a distinctive clicking sound, metal on metal. sykes looks up and kipling drops down on him from directly above! sykes goes down in a heap. he's managed to hold onto the gun and as kipling comes for him, he swings the gun hand around. kipling sees it, lashes out, slamming the gun from sykes' hand. sykes tries to get to his feet, but the alien grabs him and flings him down the tunnel. a siren is heard approaching in background. kipling moves in to deliver the coup de grace. as he draws near, sykes hears that distinctive clicking sound again. sykes' p.o.v. though his vision is blurred, sykes still gets a good look at an exotic silver bracelet on the alien's wrist. the strands of this bracelet are what make the clinking noise.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{the alien rears back, and as he does, the approaching siren suddenly wails louder as a backup patrol car swings onto the street heading this way. kipling sees this and leaves sykes, running off down the dark tunnel.}
<B>__{on sykes}
<A>__{dazed, struggling to rise. we hear running footsteps approaching. sykes turns, his eyes wild and unfocused. sykes' p.o.v. an out of focus alien face looming over him.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{sykes whips around in a roundhouse swing with all his weight on it, pistoning his fist straight into the alien face. the alien, caught by surprise and off balance, sprawls backward out of frame. sykes is grabbed by a human uniformed cop, as he tries to swing again.}
<C>__{human cop}
<D>__{whoa, whoa... hold it. take it easy.}
<P>__{(to alien on the ground)}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{sykes stops struggling, and his eyes focus. he looks at the alien he just decked, sprawled on his ass ten feet away. the alien is a uniformed cop... his name is jetson.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{i am all right.}
<A>__{he gets up. a trickle of purple blood runs from his nose.}
<C>__{human cop}
<D>__{i better call in.}
<A>__{he moves off. jetson moves toward sykes and the raincoat alien's body. sykes tenses, thinking jetson might retaliate in some way. but jetson simply steps past him to kneel beside the dead alien. he checks for a pulse on the underside of the dead alien's upper arm. nothing. sykes is holding his punching hand in obvious pain. he struggles to rise. jetson gets an arm around him to help him up.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{your hand will require attention.}
<A>__{sykes roughly jerks himself free of jetson's grip.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{get the hell away from me! i don't need your goddamn help.}
<A>__{he almost loses his balance and has to steady himself against the tunnel wall. sykes leans there, the picture of impotent rage and frustration. jetson looks at him, with that slight inquisitive expression aliens exhibit when trying to understand human nature.}
