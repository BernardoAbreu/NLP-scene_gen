<A>__{war torn and pirated. a pit of molten lava bursts through the floor above which floats a giant ball of silvery liquid held suspended by the pulsing field of the hyper drive. tendrils of fire strain towards the bubble. as they explode into the silver liquid, images form within the sphere, nearly coherent, then gone. a tracked gantry stretches from the floor, leading out over the bubble. at the end of the track a crow's nest of computers shoots a single laser down into the center of the bubble.}

<D>__{. . .ouch. who ordered me that last drink? what the hell is going on?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i think we crossed into our own future. we've come back to the jupiter two decades after we left.}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{look father, what my flights of fancy have wrought. i used your hypergate to build my time machine.}
<A>__{will moves to a control console at the base of the giant gantry.}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{over the years i have struggled in vain to harness the awesome power of time. all my experiments at creating a stable doorway have been futile. until now. today you will witness my ultimate triumph.}
<A>__{will hits a button. a generator opens, revealing a glowing cylinder of core material incrementally descending into the console.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{the core material. if we could get that back to our jupiter two...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the doorways in time that led us here must be a side effect of his machine coming on line. like streams running into the ocean....}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{once this core material in fully introduced into the control console, i will open a doorway stable enough for one person to take one trip through time and space as well. today, i will change history.}
<A>__{will turns a switch on the control console. (over) more tremors. the laser beam's intensity grown, and in the corridor cut by the beam into the bubble images begins to stabilize. images of earth.}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{i will return home, to the very day you took us on this cursed mission. i will stop us from taking off. i will do what you never could. i will save the family. i will save us all.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{look around. your machine is ripping this planet}
<A>__{apart. what if the force}
<D>__{wave you ride home has the same effect on earth? what if, in getting home, you destroy earth in the process?}
<A>__{a beat. then will turns away, goes back to work.}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{i'm going home. i'm going to save the family.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{will, i'm your father. you've got to listen to me .}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{let me tell you about my father. my father was a walking ghost. never there when i needed him. he dragged his family into deep dark space and lost them there. my father is not coming to the rescue.}
