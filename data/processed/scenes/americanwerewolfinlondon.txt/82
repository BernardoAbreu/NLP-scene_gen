<C>__{david}
<P>__{(pleading, whimpering)}
<D>__{i'm sorry i called you a meat loaf, jack.}
<A>__{new bolts of agonizing pain wrack through david's body. he grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are burning him. standing naked in the center of the room, david gasps for air. he falls to his knees and then forward on his hands. he remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his torment; but it's no use. on all fours he gives himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change. the metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy one. as bone and muscle bend and reform themselves, the body suffers lacerating pain. we can actually see david's flesh move, the rearranging tissue. his mouth bleeds as fangs emerge. his whole face distorts as his jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before our eyes. his hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as claws burst forward. the camera pans up to show the full moon outside through the window. david's moans change slowly into low guttural growls. we hear the four footfalls as the wolf begins to walk. as the camera pans back over the room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the wolf padding off into the darkness.}
