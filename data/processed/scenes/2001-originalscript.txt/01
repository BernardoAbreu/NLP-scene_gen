<A>__{the man apes of the field had none of these attributes, and they were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction. about twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking a small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream. the tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving. as the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, moonwatcher discovers that his father has died during the night. he did not know the old one was his father, for such a relationship was beyond his understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emaciated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. then he carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the hyenas. among his kind, moonwatcher is almost a giant. he is nearly five feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over a hundred pounds. his hairy, muscular body is quite man like, and his head is already nearer man than ape. the forehead is low, and there are great ridges over the eye sockets, yet he unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. as he looks out now upon the hostile world, there is alreadysomething in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. in those dark, deep set eyes is a dawning awareness the first intimations of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another two million years.}
