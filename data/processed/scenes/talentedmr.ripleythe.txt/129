<A>__{the door of his closet flips open with the swell and he catches his reflection. it swings shut. open then shut. through the porthole the weather's changing as the light dies. there's a swell as the horizon rises and falls in the round glass. ripley, alone, in a nightmare of his own making. the end. lullaby for cain from the silence from the night comes a distant lullabye cry, remembering that first cry your brother standing by and loved both loved beloved sons of mine sing a lullabye mother is close by innocent eyes such innocent eyes envy stole your brother's life came home murdered peace of mind left you nightmares on the pillow sleep now soul, surrendering your soul the heart of you not whole for love but love what toll cast into the dark branded with the mark of shame of cain from the garden of god's light to a wilderness of light sleep now sleep now.}
