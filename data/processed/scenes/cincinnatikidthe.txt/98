<L>__{interior poker suite bill, melba and the shooter}
<A>__{melba fills a beer glass from a bottle and serves it to the shooter.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(to melba)}
<D>__{it always distresses me, a man reaching his middle years and still having no assurance of next week's income.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{i know what you mean. i like a man to have plenty of assurance.}
<A>__{the shooter's gaze wanders o.s. camera moves to feature the objects of his attention, who are lady fingers, lancey and the kid. the two men would like to talk to each other, but lady finger's is monopolizing lancey, and he doesn't want to offend her.}
<C>__{lady fingers}
<D>__{spider man died kind of slow. first he give them a kidney, then his gall bladder, and then they taking his whole damn stomach. you remember spider man, run the dice table down at turk's club to memphis.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{who? oh, spider man, sure, sure.}
<C>__{lady fingers}
<D>__{he died kind of slow.}
<A>__{the shooter comes to lancey's rescue.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{need your help, lady fingers... to make arrangements for food and shelter.}
<A>__{he whisks her away. lancey and the kid, finally facing each other alone, don't quite know how to begin.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{good crowd.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{yeah. nice looking broads.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{that's a fact.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{that was a pretty thing to watch what you done to pig with those jacks.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{thanks, kid. from you, that's nice to hear.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{when he bet out first, he was ready to think you had them back to back. even when he bet the size of the pot, he figured there was still a chance you were laying for him. but when you called him, i could see it in his eyes he thought you had jacks and tens, and i knew you had him hooked.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{you knew, did you? before i raised?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{oh, sure, i seen what you were pulling all along.}
<A>__{lancey is a bit taken aback by the kid's confident assertion, but he manages a smile.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{you been to miami, kid?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{not yet.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{beautiful town, lot of loose money around. you ought to come down some time.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{you mean it?}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{sure, sure. lot of room down there. another spot you ought to work someday is reno, nevada.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i heard.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{you got to have nerves though. so much going on. action everywhere you turn. you lose the feel of the cards when you're in so much action day in, day out.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i'd like to make it out there.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{there's different levels of action there you'd find yours, any kind you could ask for.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i generally stick to stud.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{sure, sure, for eating money. but you know how it is, i like to lay off once in a while and try craps. nothing serious i don't even think of it as work.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{oh, i do that. i will take a night off and shoot a little casino. or even blackjack.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{your age, you don't need a regular vacation every year. but me, i have to forget the grind for a couple of weeks. i go to this place near delray beach, and the whole time i don't play anything but bridge.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{that's interesting. i could go for bridge if there was a way to do it without partners.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{i'm not keeping you from your woman, am i?}
<C>__{kid}
<P>__{(after a slight hesitation)}
<D>__{no. we're she's gone away for a while. we're not sure we're looking for the same thing.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{i'm sorry to hear that.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i was hoping christian would run with me and wouldn't try to make a big deal out of it.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{but she tried?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{yeah, and now i don't know. i don't figure a man can change his way because the way i see it a man's lucky he's got something going for him that he can hold on to. a man can't change his way for a woman.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{nooo, a man can't do that.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i been wondering if it isn't maybe a better idea not to look for a fixed thing. just tie in to something nice when you're away from the action, and enjoy it, and let it wear itself out.}
<C>__{lancey}
<P>__{(after a long moment)}
<D>__{that's very interesting you should say that. you're pretty young to have figured things out already.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{well she didn't understand how it was with me and }
<C>__{lancey}
<P>__{(warmly)}
<D>__{between us?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{there ain't but a few people, i guess who would understand }
<C>__{lancey}
<P>__{(as the kid doesn't finish)}
<D>__{kid, you're the best stud man i've seen in 35 years of action. you know that?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{well thank you.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{and when it comes to broads, which is getting to be an academic problem i can look back now to the two or three i ever considered i might want to spend the rest of my life with, and you know what? i like it... looking back on them, that is }
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i always got a lot of companionship out of a good book.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{it's very educational, hearing what it's like for a man your age.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{glad to be of help. and it's good we had this little talk so i know we can be friends regardless what happens.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{that sounds good to me. i didn't think you was coming in at me like a grudge match.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{no room for any kind of emotion in a fair game of stud. i learned that a long time ago.}
<C>__{lady fingers' voice }
<D>__{ready for some action, gentlemen.}
<A>__{they look at each other and then exit.}
<B>__{angle including the poker table}
<A>__{lady fingers is sitting in shooter's place, rippling and shuffling the cards. yeller, sokal, and the shooter are all either sitting at the table or standing near it. lancey, followed by the kid, returns to the table.}
<C>__{lady fingers}
<D>__{it's a whole new deal. good hands all around. prosperity for everybody.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{you're still good, fingers.}
<C>__{lady fingers}
<D>__{getting crippled up, lancey. not many of the old gang left. you heard whistling sam was gone?}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{no, i didn't hear.}
<C>__{lady fingers}
<D>__{i was the one got called to the morgue to identify him. i don't suppose you seen anybody been run over by a twelve ton bulldozer.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{no, can't say that i have.}
<C>__{lady fingers}
<D>__{don't go out of your way.}
<A>__{(time lapse)}
