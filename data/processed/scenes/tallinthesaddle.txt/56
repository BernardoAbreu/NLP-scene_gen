<L>__{exterior main street santa inez day}
<A>__{on arly and juan, mounted. they see rocklin going into garvey's place.}
<L>__{interior garvey's office day}
<A>__{med. shot toward door, with garvey at desk in f.g. the door opens and rocklin enters.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(effusively)}
<D>__{oh, come in, mr. rocklin. come right in.}
<A>__{rocklin looks him over for a second, then comes quietly to the desk.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{i understand you were red caldwell's lawyer?}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(immediately on guard)}
<D>__{i was.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{know anything about this?}
<A>__{he takes out a letter and hands it to garvey. the latter takes it slowly, handling it as if it were dangerous. he looks from the letter to rocklin and back again. then reluctantly, he opens it and begins to read. letter it reads: dear mr. rocklin: glad you have made up your mind to take the job. enclosed find train fare and $150 advance on wages. yours faithfully, j. caldwell}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{rocklin and garvey. the latter looks up from the letter completely bewildered.}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{i don't understand. job? what job?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{foreman.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(gaping)}
<D>__{on the "k.c."?}
<P>__{(trying to take it in)}
<D>__{but but why should he want you?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{why not? good foremen don't grow on bushes.}
<A>__{there is a little pause, with garvey still bewildered.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(thinking hard)}
<D>__{is that your only motive for coming here?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{what other motive could i have?}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{i don't know it's just that red caldwell was a peculiar man had a funny way of doing things.}
<A>__{he studies rocklin a short moment, then sits back comfortably and relieved.}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{well, i'm sorry, mr. rocklin, that you've been brought all this way on a fool's errand, but i'm afraid the deal's off.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{off?}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{i don't want to be too hard on you, but as executor of the estate i have to consider the interests of the new owner. how about, say, a hundred in full settlement?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{well }
<A>__{there is a knock on the door. garvey rises and speaks on his way to the door.}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{that's my last word think it over.}
<A>__{garvey opens the door, and miss martin stalks in followed by clare.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(graciously)}
<D>__{how do you do, ladies }
<C>__{miss martin}
<P>__{(icily)}
<D>__{you are judge garvey, i presume.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{yes and you are }
<C>__{miss martin}
<D>__{miss martin and my niece, clara caldwell.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(reaching for a chair)}
<D>__{of course of course }
<A>__{miss martin sits stiffly as she eyes rocklin coldly.}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{you came at a very opportune moment, madam. this gentleman claims to have some sort of a letter from the late mr. caldwell, engaging him as foreman of the "k.c."}
<C>__{miss martin}
<D>__{what!}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(to garvey)}
<D>__{what do you mean claims to have? you saw it, didn't you?}
<C>__{miss martin}
<P>__{(before garvey can answer)}
<D>__{you can't hold us to account for every promise made by that man. everyone knows he wasn't responsible for his actions half the time. and if you think i'd have you as a foreman }
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(finds it hard to control himself)}
<D>__{listen, lady i'd rather walk for somebody else, than ride for you.}
<C>__{miss martin}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{well the impudence }
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{all i come for this morning was to pay beck the hundred and fifty red caldwell sent in advance.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{oh, no}
<A>__{they all turn and stare at her.}
<C>__{miss martin}
<D>__{don't interfere, clara. of course he must pay it back.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{the railway fare well, i reckon we can check that up against the time lost and call it quits.}
<P>__{(throws down a roll}
<D>__{of bills in front of}
<P>__{garvey)}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(summoning up her courage)}
<D>__{but, mr. er i don't know your name...}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(raising his hat)}
<D>__{rocklin, miss.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{mr. rocklin, it isn't fair for you to pay anything back.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{that's how i'd prefer it, if you don't mind, miss never did care fer owing favors to no one especially women.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(as if she had been struck)}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{the sound of rapid steps approaching from outside is heard and they all look toward the door.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{on door, as it opens to admit arly. ignoring everyone in the room except garvey, she comes abruptly to the desk, with the riding quirt dangling from her wrist.}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{i've just heard they let george clews out of penitentiary and that he's headed this way. you might tell him from me, if he sets foot on the santee ranch, i will shoot him on sight.}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{but really, miss arly, why should you deliver your message through me?}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{you have mutual friends.}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{if you're referring to sheriff jackson...}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{but that's absurd. the fact that he employs one of the clews brothers doesn't make the other his friend.}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(contemptuously)}
<D>__{have it your own way; but it'd be fair to warn him, because i mean it.}
<A>__{for the first time, she appears to be conscious of the presence of the other women.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(hastening to change the conversation)}
<D>__{oh, miss caldwell, this is miss harolday miss martin, miss caldwell's aunt. you should know one another, seeing you'll be neighbors. miss harolday runs the santee ranch for her stepfather. she's a famous ah horsewoman in these parts.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(with ingenuous enthusiasm)}
<D>__{i know. i saw you ride into town this morning. you looked lovely. just what i'd like to be.}
<A>__{arly stares at her unbelievingly for a second.}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(slowly, a bit flustered)}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{she looks slowly from clara to rocklin, as if suspecting collusion.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(completely innocent)}
<D>__{oh, this is mr. rocklin. he drove us in from garden city last night. he...}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(dead pan)}
<D>__{i already met miss harolday.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(stonily, to rocklin)}
<D>__{i've a message for you from harolday.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(murmuring)}
<D>__{what, again?}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{he wants you to come down to the office.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{he's got a proposition to make about riding for him. sixty a month.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{hmmm that's a foreman's wages.}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(suddenly exploding)}
<D>__{i wouldn't offer you a red cent.}
<P>__{(controlling herself)}
<D>__{but it's his money.}
<P>__{(bitingly)}
<D>__{and the way things are shaping, maybe we could do with somebody as mean as you around the ranch.}
<C>__{miss martin}
<P>__{(pushing her way forward)}
<D>__{i warn you, you're making a great mistake. this man is no good.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{auntie!}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(to rocklin ignoring miss martin)}
<D>__{well? d'you want the job?}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{rocklin, as he stares at arly with an enigmatic expression. suddenly, he seems to make up his mind.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(indicating the door)}
<D>__{lead the way.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{as arly turns abruptly on her heel and exits the way she came. rocklin makes a little gesture to the ladies with his hat and follows. as he goes, juan, who has been leaning against the doorpost, follows, closing the door behind him.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(after they have gone)}
<D>__{auntie, why did you have to say that? i simply don't understand you...}
<C>__{miss martin}
<P>__{(cutting in, grimly)}
<D>__{but i understand you.}
<P>__{(scathingly)}
<D>__{i'd be ashamed of myself. throwing myself at a man like that.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i... i...}
<P>__{(suddenly bursting into tears)}
<D>__{oh, you're horrid horrid. i wish i'd never come.}
<A>__{she turns abruptly and drops onto the couch by the window. camera pans to hold a close two shot of garvey and miss martin.}
<C>__{miss martin}
<D>__{you must excuse her. she's young.}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{and inexperienced.}
<A>__{garvey leans back in his chair and smiles.}
<C>__{miss martin}
<P>__{(significantly)}
<D>__{and young people must be protected from themselves at times don't you agree?}
<A>__{miss martin throws him a quick look, which he returns steadily.}
<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(at last, with a grim echo of a smile)}
<D>__{exactly.}
