<A>__{shoes dumped on her desk, dehaven changes out knee high stockings while devoting one ear to...}
<D>__{white house #1 ... to reassure you that he has every faith in the ability of mr. hayes to guide the navy into the next century. the task, as the administration sees it, is to acknowledge changing realities without losing traditional values.}
<A>__{a beat. dehaven looks between the two white house boys #1 young and eager, #2 older and cagier.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{'zat it? ten minutes, nothin' on the table? sweetcakes, you best go back to the president and tell him to open up the phone book and start lookin' for his next nominee.}
<A>__{white house #1 looks spanked. taking over, #2 pops a briefcase. an inch think report appears before dehaven.}
<D>__{white house #2 administration's plan for 100 percent integration. if female candidates measure up in a series of test cases, the president will support full integration within three years' time.}
<A>__{surprised maybe even startled dehaven flips through the report, absorbing by osmosis.}
<D>__{white house #2 it's your gender blind navy, senator. surely you're not going to balk now.}

<D>__{by calling women "honorary men." ingenious. white house #2 c'mon, senator, president's pitchin' right down the center of your plate. if women measure up to men, they've got the job. you going to take a swing? or step out of the box?}
<A>__{dehaven riffles the edges of the report, thinking it over. thinking light years ahead.}
