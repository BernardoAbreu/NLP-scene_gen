<A>__{a beat. turk seems confused...}
<C>__{turk}
<D>__{each?}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{who negotiated this?}
<A>__{danny and rusty look at linus,}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{livingston}
<D>__{what do we know so far?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{there's a dummy key pad by the front door.}
<P>__{(points to a diagram)}
<D>__{but the alarm is really controlled by the keypad in mr. vanderspeigle's second floor office. now, here's good news: we already know the system's master code. evelyn gave it to us.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's not good news, that's really good news.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{we just wait until he leaves.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yeah, well...that's the bad news.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{he doesn't.}
<A>__{frank flinches. doesn't like what he's hearing.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{he's agoraphobic.}
<B>__{amsterdam planning montage}
<A>__{shots of their mark, vanderspeigle, being an agoraphobic weirdo.}
<C>__{livingston}
<D>__{so he's never been out of his house? ever?}
<C>__{rusty }
<D>__{not once since he moved in ten years ago.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{doesn't this guy believe in fresh air?}
<C>__{rusty }
<D>__{cracks his windows at night...that's about it.}
<A>__{when vanderspeigle cracks his window we see that locking pins fall into place to prevent the window from opening more than a few inches.}
<C>__{livingston }
<D>__{can we tap into the system from the outside through the phone lines?}
<C>__{rusty }
<D>__{negative. it's a closed loop system with two redundant servers locked into titanium cases in the guy's bedroom.}
<A>__{we see the servers in vanderspeigle's bedroom.}
<C>__{basher }
<D>__{could we use a remote device to trigger the panel?}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{it's hard wired and shielded.}
