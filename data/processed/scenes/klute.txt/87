<A>__{this is a hangout where black and white pimps wait to meet their whores after their night of street walking. this streetwalker world is far removed from the world of the call girl or the world of janie dale. camera pans past a group of pimps at the bar taking bet on whose girls have made the most money that night. camera then goes on to reveal klute talking to another pimp (azure). azure represents a clear step down from frank ligourin. we catch only part of their dialogue.}
