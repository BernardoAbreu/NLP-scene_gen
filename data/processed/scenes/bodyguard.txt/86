<L>__{interior dance floor night}
<A>__{frank and rachel navigate a tiny dance floor. frank is a surprisingly good dancer and is comfortable being this close to her. rachel hums softly, picking up the words to the song. as we listen to the lyrics something clicks in her head.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you like this?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{a beat, then rachel bursts out laughing.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(reddening)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(trying to compose herself)}
<D>__{i'm sorry... it's just that... it's so depressing.}
<A>__{now they're both laughing.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{it is, isn't it.}
<A>__{suddenly a dish drops to the floor. frank, still dancing, makes a smooth quick turn that puts his body between rachel and the noise. his head turns to locate the source of the noise.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{don't worry, i will protect you.}
<A>__{they drift back into the music, rachel singing, frank watching.}
