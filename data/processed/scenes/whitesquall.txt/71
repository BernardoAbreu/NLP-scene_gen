<A>__{chuck and robin stand before the door.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i can't go in there.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what are you talking about.}
<A>__{robin turns away, ashamed.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{the guys were right. it'll mean nothing coming from me. he'll listen to you chuck. everybody does.}
<L>__{interior chart house same}
<A>__{skipper and alice have paperwork spread out in front of them. a knock.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{come.}
<A>__{chuck enters, awkward.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{what's on your mind?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.}
<A>__{skipper looks up.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{well, spit it out.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{the fact is... we'd like you to give phil another chance.}
<A>__{alice raises her eyebrows, surprised.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{can't do it.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{sir...?}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{close the door. sit down.}
<A>__{chuck does as he is told.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{why do you think i'm sending him home?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{he killed the dolphin.}
<A>__{skipper looks at chuck for a moment.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{the dolphin was a symptom.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{of what?}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{of a fight he can't win out here.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{it's his father sir. he's suffocating him. we've all seen it...}
<A>__{suddenly it's as if chuck is talking about his own life.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is. what right did then have to show up here?}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{they have every right chuck.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{they send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.}
<A>__{skipper sits up and studies chuck for a moment.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{let me tell you something about phil's father, and your's too. how do you think you got here? you think this is all free, that they owe you something? you think they enjoy riding subways and commuter trains, driving buses or pulling lobster traps? work fifty weeks a year to keep you in tennis shoes and private school? look around at how the rest of the world lives chuck. we're the luckiest people alive, every one of us. they gave it up for you and phil, and me too my friend.}
<A>__{chuck chews on it.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{there are ground rules in families just like on this boat. if you and phil don't like it, i'm sorry. someday you'll understand that, and if you're lucky, you'll come home and find your best friend has been there all along waiting for you to forgive him for being a father. it'll be the way it used to be, when you were ten and your dad was a giant.}
<A>__{now it's skipper who is talking about himself.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{does phil know how you guys feel?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{you should tell him. that's something he can take with him.}
<A>__{chuck nods and leaves.}
