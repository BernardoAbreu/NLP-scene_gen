<L>__{interior the town library}
<A>__{thomas sifts through some clippings on general hawthrone. tactical genius. the man who saved korea. brutal. almost court marshalled a dozen times for his inspired savagery. a truly ruthless man who spent the last twenty years quietly tending his garden in a dying town.}
<L>__{interior the town church}
<A>__{small, simple, and woodplanked. the church we saw at the beginning. thomas sits there, staring at the candles, the altar, the crucifix. he's alone there. but for a creeping buzz. a feeling in the air.}
<C>__{gabriel's voice}
<D>__{it's unusual to see someone of your age in church on a weekday.}
<A>__{thomas turns in surprise. gabriel is kneeling in the row behind, inches from his ear.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{don't get me wrong. i think it's an excellent sign of character.}
<A>__{there's something cold and creepy about gabriel. out of place in here. there's another sound. teeth chattering far in the back. thomas turns and sees jerry, deep in the shadows of the choir box. jerry waves.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{never mind him. he shouldn't even be in here. least not standing.}
<A>__{those sunglasses. impenetrably dark. like at the skid row flophouse.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you're not from here.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{either are you.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i'm looking for something.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{have you found it?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i will. have you found what you're looking for?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{i will.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(appraising him)}
<D>__{i don't doubt it.}
<P>__{(stands)}
<D>__{you'll let me know? when you find it?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{where are you staying?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i'm around.}
<A>__{and he walks out, leaving thomas alone in a place gone suddenly cold.}
