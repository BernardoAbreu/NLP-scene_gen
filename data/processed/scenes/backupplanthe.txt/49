<L>__{interior nana's room later}
<A>__{nana hands zoe a cup of tea. zoe's eyes well with tears.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{what am i going to do?}
<C>__{nana}
<D>__{i'm confused. isn't this what you wanted? you bought sperm and were inseminated by your doctor. this isn't what we would call an accident.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{but now it's all happening so fast. did i really think this through?}
<C>__{nana}
<A>__{we talked about it for months. you said it was what you wanted more than anything in the world.}
<C>__{zoe}
<A>__{but this guy, he's...special. it's all going to fall apart now.}
<C>__{nana}
<A>__{what makes him so special?}
<C>__{zoe}
<A>__{i don't know. he's very...real. and funny. and different. the other guys i've been with all had their briefcases and their five year plans and their secretaries they were fucking. stan doesn't have a five year plan. i don't even know if he has a plan.}
<C>__{nana}
<A>__{what about a secretary?}
<C>__{zoe}
<A>__{some kid named fred.}
<P>__{(then)}
<A>__{i like him, nana.}
<C>__{nana}
<A>__{well, if he's the right one, he'll stay.}
<C>__{zoe}
<A>__{do you really think so?}
<C>__{nana}
<A>__{gosh, i don't know. i hoped that would be enough to appease you.}
<C>__{zoe}
<A>__{should i still visit him for the weekend? or should i just vanish and hope he forgets i ever existed.}
<C>__{nana}
<A>__{don't be silly. go up there for the weekend. spend some time with him and see what he's really like.}
<C>__{zoe}
<A>__{yeah. you're right.}
<C>__{nana}
<D>__{you might find out he's a total douchebag and then the whole thing is moot.}
<A>__{zoe looks at nana. douchebag?}
