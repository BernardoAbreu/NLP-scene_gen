<L>__{exterior pod door lieutenant}
<A>__{on duty. he hears a noise and turns... and in a flash of light a speeding disk smashes into him, knocking him over. the camera watches over his de rezzing body. we see a figure approaching closer... its arm is raised, and... the disk slams back into the hand.}
<B>__{closer shot}
<A>__{it is tron. he steps over the body of the lieutenant.}
<B>__{the mcp}
<A>__{from right outside. we see the prisoners beginning to file inside, up the final slope leading to the base of the mcp.}
<B>__{side shot of the entrance}
<A>__{to the mcp. as the guardian programs enter. sark stands waiting, watching them, his back to the camera.}
<B>__{pov of the doomed programs}
<A>__{as the first one gets through the opening. the light from the mcp's beam pours out. moving forward, through the entrance, the mcp is finally revealed. a giant cylinder, a hundred feet high, with a network of circuit lines, and stretched across all the visible surface... is a face. flattened, stretched, bizarrely distorted, the face is capable of moving to any section of the cylinder. the impression is similar to the look of a grotesquely fat person's face, but more so. it's horrible. beneath the floating cylinder face two inverted cones of light, meeting at their apex, support it. we continue moving forward, the mcp looming over us. then the camera stops and the doomed programs file past us, separating and going to the inner walls. the mcp speaks, we see his enormous lips moving.}

<P>__{(echoing, booming)}
<D>__{i am delighted that so many of you could turn out to give your power over to me...}
<A>__{full shot the programs lining the wall. they are sucked back, pinned, immobile, and we see them starting to de rez.}
<C>__{mcp}
<D>__{you're very lucky, all of you. you are participating in the creation of the single most powerful program in the history of the system... of all systems...}
<A>__{the programs begin to disappear, one by one.}
<C>__{mcp}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{a program with a will... with ambition... a superior form of life...}
