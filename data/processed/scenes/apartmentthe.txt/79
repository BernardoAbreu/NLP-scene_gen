<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yes, sir i understand.}
<P>__{(taking fran's letter out of his pocket)}
<D>__{she left a note you want me to open it and read it to you?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{well, it was just a suggestion no, you don't have to worry about that, mr. sheldrake i kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble, police wise or newspaper wise }
<A>__{as bud continues talking on the phone, fran, in the bedroom, opens her eyes, looks around vaguely, trying to figure out where she is. she sits up in bed, winces, holds her head in her hands she has a fierce hangover.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{ you see, the doctor, he's a friend of mine we were very lucky in that respect actually, he thinks she's my girl no, he just jumped to the conclusion around here, i'm known as quite a ladies' man }
<A>__{in the bedroom fran, becoming aware of bud's voice, crawls out of bed and holding on to the furniture, moves unsteadily toward the living room door.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{ of course, we're not out of the woods yet sometimes they try it again yes sir, i will do my best it looks like it'll be a couple of days before she's fully recovered, and i may have a little problem with the landlady }
<A>__{behind him, fran appears in the bedroom doorway, barefooted and in her slip. she leans groggily against the door post, trying to focus on bud and to concentrate on what he's saying.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{ all right, mr. sheldrake, i will keep her in my apartment as long as i can any sort of message you want me to give her? well, i will think of something goodbye, mr. sheldrake.}
<A>__{he hangs up the phone slowly.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{bud turns around, sees her standing there on rubbery legs.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. baxter.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{miss kubelik }
<P>__{(hurries toward her)}
<D>__{ you shouldn't be out of bed.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i didn't know i had no idea this was your apartment }
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(putting his arm around her)}
<D>__{let me help you.}
<A>__{he leads her back into the bedroom.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i'm so ashamed. why didn't you just let me die?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what kind of talk is that?}
<P>__{(he lowers her onto the bed)}
<D>__{so you got a little over emotional but you're fine now.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(a groan)}
<D>__{my head it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. what time is it?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{two o'clock.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(struggling to her feet)}
<D>__{where's my dress? i have to go home.}
<A>__{her knees buckle. bud catches her.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you're in no condition to go anywhere except back to bed.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{you don't want me here }
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{sure i do. it's always nice to have company for christmas.}
<A>__{he tries to put her back to bed. fran resists.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{miss kubelik, i'm stronger than you are }
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i just want to go brush my teeth }
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{oh of course. i think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.}
<A>__{he crosses to the bathroom, takes a plaid robe off the hook on the back of the door, hands it to fran.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{here put this on.}
<A>__{in the bathroom, he finds an unused toothbrush in a plastic container. his eyes fall on his safety razor. with a glance toward the bedroom, he unscrews the razor, removes the blade, drops it in his shirt pocket. then he empties the blades from the dispenser, puts those in his pocket. now he notices a bottle of iodine on the medicine shelf, stashes that in another pocket, just as fran appears in the doorway wearing the robe.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(handing her the toothbrush)}
<D>__{here. how about some breakfast?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{no i don't want anything.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i will fix you some coffee.}
<A>__{he crosses the bedroom, heading for the kitchen, stops.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{oh we're all out of coffee you had quite a lot of it last night }
<A>__{he thinks for a moment, hurries toward the hall door.}
