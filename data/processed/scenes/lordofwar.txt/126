<L>__{exterior refugee camp sierra leone. day.}
<A>__{a tent city. a jeep packed with young, machete wielding freedom fighters circles the refugee camp, taunting and terrorizing the inhabitants. the mostly women and children are trapped by the circling jeep. whenever a refugee attempts to escape, they are driven back by the increasingly manic, shrieking rebels. yuri's two trucks are parked on the roadway above the camp where the rest of the rebels are massed a rag tag mob wearing over sized sneakers, carrying machetes and the occasional ak 47. at a small folding table a rebel leader negotiates with yuri and andre jnr. the leader places a pile of uncut diamonds on the table. vitaly is more interested in the camp observing the circling jeep full of rebels and their smirking comrades on the highway. from a distance, he spies a woman and young son make a desperate bid for escape from the camp. two rebels, on foot, give chase. the woman appears to be pregnant. vitaly watches in horror. the woman is quickly overtaken and hacked to death. then the boy. vitaly can't look, turns away.}
