<L>__{interior "the arena" day}
<A>__{riley and charlie step into the cellar of an old brownstone. dirt floor. stone walls. the place is filled with smoke and buzzing with flies. as riley and charley turn their guns over to two big bruisers inside, a tout named roach sidles over.}
<C>__{tout}
<P>__{(eyeing the weapons) supply run last}
<D>__{night, uh? bet you have some money in your pocket. i can show you how to turn that money into more money.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{roach. where's chihuahua?}
<C>__{tout}
<D>__{maybe i can find him for you. come on in.}
<A>__{riley is already in. he has pushed past the tout and is striding into a fog where gamblers are rushing to place bets with heavily armed bookies. we're reminded of a cock fighting joint in a pancho villa movie.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{lot of action tonight.}
<C>__{tout}
<D>__{gotta new kind of game.}
<A>__{iley strides toward a cluster of bettors. a very tall man stands among them, wearing a texas stetson that sticks up high above all other heads, its peacock feathers poking even higher out of a snake skin hat band. iley grabs him and spins him around. he man's feet are off the ground. way off the ground. far from tall, he's a little person, who has been standing on a platform, wearing a purple satin pimp suit. he's a latino, who looks like a chihuahua. and that's his name. chihuahua.}
<C>__{chihuahua}
<D>__{put me down! put me down!}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{what happened to my fucking car?}
<C>__{chihuahua}

<C>__{riley}
<D>__{i went over to the garage. your guys aren't there. the car's not there. my dinero's not there.}
<C>__{chihuahua}
<D>__{hey, this is not me. i did not do this to you. i am your friend. put me down. come on. i find out what went wrong.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{just get me the car, or they'll carry you out of here inside that fucking hat.}
