<L>__{interior abandoned factory, industrial elevator night}
<A>__{more uv lights flicker on. we're in a massive loading elevator which hums as it ascends, eventually reaching its destination with a booming clang. the doors at the rear glide open. blade guides the olds out.}
<L>__{interior abandoned factory, whistler's workshop night}
<A>__{set up in an old ironworks, the place looks like a cross between an auto junkyard and an armory. equipment is strewn everywhere lathes, mills, old furnaces, gutted vehicles, an ad hoc surgical theater all of it jerry rigged in a brutal, oily tech. blade climbs out of the olds. he opens the passenger door and pulls karen out, carries her in his arms.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{whistler!}
<C>__{whistler }
<D>__{are we bringing home strays now?}
<A>__{abraham whistler (60s) hobbles out of the shadows, leaning heavily on a cane. gimlet eyed, bitter, his right leg encased in a metal brace. though his face is lined with wrinkles and his hair has long since gone gray, we sense he could kick the living shit out of any man half his age.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{she's been bitten.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{you should've killed her, then.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{she hasn't turned yet.}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{you can help her.}
<A>__{blade and whistler stare each other down. finally, whistler turns and heads over to the operating theater.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{no promises. you watch her close. she starts to turn, you finish her off.}
<A>__{blade nods, lays karen down on the operating table. whistler turns on an overhead light. karen is sheathed in sweat, ashen. she's lost a lot of blood. whistler snaps on a pair of surgical gloves, probes the wound in karen's neck with an antiseptic swab there's capillary damage around the perimeter of the wound, the tissue looks bruised, gangrenous.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{localized necrosis. she's borderline. another hour and she'd be well into the change.}
<A>__{whistler cracks open a smelling salt capsule and waves under karen's nose. as she starts to stir }
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{can you hear me, woman?}
<A>__{karen's eyes open wide. she's scared, disoriented }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what ?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{you've been bitten by a vampire. we've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite }
<A>__{whistler reaches for a massive syringe filled with caustic looking fluid. karen sees the syringe, resists }
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{hold her.}
<A>__{blade forces karen back. whistler readies the syringe.}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(reading her name tag)}
<D>__{"dr. karen jansen". listen close, i'm going to inject you with an antidote made from allium setivum garlic. this is going to hurt. a lot.}
<A>__{whistler sinks the needle into karen's neck and depresses the plunger. "hurt" doesn't begin to describe what karen experiences nexterior imagine undergoing childbirth while someone pumps battery acid through your veins. karen shrieks, her body going into uncontrolled paroxysms. the wound on her neck begins to smoke as the antidote attacks the poisonous vampire venom. karen clutches at blade's arms, digging her nails in. she stares up at him with unflinching intensity, like a child desperately searching for assurance. on blade, uncomfortable playing the roll of nursemaid. he'd like nothing more than to be done with this, but the only thing he can do is hold karen while she rides out the seizures. karen's pov growing darker by the moment. the last thing she sees is blade staring down at her then the night closes in.}
