<L>__{interior adult bookstore day}
<A>__{welles comes in through the blacked out door. this place is larger than the last. two clerks are behind the counter. one clerk's pricing porn, the other, max, 25, reads a porno novel. max has long hair, colorful tattoos covering his forearms, has a highlighter marker in his mouth. welles browses. there's a huge video bargain bin. walls are covered in videos, sex toys, inflatable women, etc. customers, again all wary males, follow proper porn shop etiquette; look at the porn, not your fellow shopper. there are "peep show" booths in the back. a man looks around, trying to be nonchalant, sweating profusely, slipping behind one curtain. welles pretends to read the packaging on a triple pack of dildos, looks towards the front... behind the register, max takes a look to make sure the other clerk is busy, takes the cap of his highlighter pen and highlights a section in the book he's reading. welles notes this. he goes to the substantial magazine rack, picks up a porn tabloid, pages through it. he selects sex magazines and newspapers, choosing about twenty five. welles takes this pile up to max, gets out his wallet. max starts ringing everything up.}

<C>__{welles}
<D>__{well, it's tempting, but no thanks.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery operated vagina and you don't have one.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i will risk it.}
<A>__{max shoves everything into a bag and hands it over.}
<C>__{max}

<C>__{max}
<D>__{once you pick it up you can't put it down.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{catchy title. what are you really reading?}
<P>__{(off max's look)}
<D>__{hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.}
<A>__{max takes a glance at the other clerk, opens the pages of the book and shows it to welles. "music for chameleons."}

<D>__{wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(smiles, shrugs)}
<D>__{might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would i be?}
<A>__{another customer clears his throat, waiting at the register. max turns to help him. welles heads out.}
