<B>__{her pov}
<A>__{the group races across the catwalk as json leaps down behind them.}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{he's right on my ass!}
<A>__{then jason grabs delongpre, who screams. rizzo, spots a gun left by one of the marines. she snatches it, points it towards jason and delongpre then aims a little high. fzzzt! it slices through a metal cord holding the catwalk to the ceiling. the catwalk jerks. everyone tumbles. jason loses his grip on delongpre. suddenly, metal screeches, as the catwalk gives under the weight. it rips in half,dumping both heroes and jason. rizzo dives out of the way as a pile of metal and bodies crash to the ground! janessa sits up rubbing her head.}
<C>__{janessa}

<A>__{he's lying on top of jason. he scrambles to his feet. but jason doesn't move.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{hey, i think the fall killed him.}
<A>__{the group slowly gathers around. jason sits up and swings at thorgan. boeman pulls him out of the way just in time. jason starts to stand when rizzo comes up behind him. ka fwam! she brings the barrel of a high tech gun down on the top of jason's head. he collapses. the surrounded faces look happily suprised.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{trust me, it's temporary.}
<A>__{boeman takes the gun from rizzo.}
<C>__{boeman}

<D>__{idiots.}
<C>__{crutch}
<D>__{this way!}
<A>__{crutch again leads them through the maze. delongpre stops at another grunt body, removes a chain gun. thorgan takes a high tech laser from another.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{i feel better. now how do you fire this damn thing?}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{just go! i've a feeling he's right behind us!}
<C>__{crutch}
<P>__{(jokingly)}

<A>__{jason steps out in front of crutch, his machete held poised in front of him. crutch runs right up onto the blade.}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{nooooo!}
<A>__{alrhoguh he's meat on a stick, crutch doesn't give up. he slams his fists into jason's torso. thorgan turns to fire boeman knocks the barrel high.}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{you'll hit crutch!}
<A>__{boeman tosses his weapon to janessa and leaps on jason's back, locking his arms around his neck.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{what are you doing? you can't save him!}
<A>__{delongpre smashes the back of jason's knee with the chaingun. jason topples on top of boeman. crutch is thrown free. janessa and thorgan help crutch to his feet as jason sees rizzo for the first time in 400 hundred years. it's either love at first sight or one hell of a grudge. he leaps to his feet and races towards her.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{don't just stand there! shoot him!}
<C>__{delongpre}
<P>__{(to jason)}
<D>__{no you don't!}
<A>__{braaaaaaatttt! the chaingun dances jason backwards. he crashes through the side of one of the cargo boxes. everyone stops.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{don't stop!}
<A>__{she jerks the gun from delongpre and races to the crate.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{you never stop when he's down!}
<A>__{but the crate is empty.}
<C>__{rizzo}
