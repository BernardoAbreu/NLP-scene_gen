<D>__{the necronomicon. yeah, that's the thing that got me here.}
<C>__{wiseman john}

<C>__{possessed woman}
<D>__{you shall never win the necronomicon. we shall feast upon your soul, and then the soul of man!}
<B>__{the possessed woman}
<A>__{collapses. her face turned away from the wisemen as it lays in the dust. close on possessed woman's face ground level camera unseen by all, her bone white eyes flare open! a nasty grin forms on her face as she lies in the dust. behind her, the wisemen approach.}
<B>__{wiseman john}
<A>__{kneels and reaches for her. ash's hand clutches wiseman john, not allowing him to touch her.}

<B>__{the possessed and burning woman}
<A>__{rushing through the air at him with a shriek! wide shot the possessed and burning woman latches onto ash like an iron trap, knocking them both to the ground.}
<B>__{ash}
