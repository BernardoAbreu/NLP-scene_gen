<A>__{a small bare room, illuminated only by the streetlight coming through the window. a hand presses a cassette into a recorder and fiddles with a small microphone. malloy sits over a table fiddling with the tape. he is young, half shaven, dressed in t shirt and jeans. he looks too louis, who stands by the window, looking out on the street, with his back to malloy. louis is dressed in an old fashioned suit.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{so you want me to tell you the story of my life...}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{that's what i do. i interview people. i collect lives. f.m. radio. f.f.r.c. i just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who }
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(quietly interrupting)}
<D>__{you'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. i've had a very unusual life.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{so much the better. i've got a pocket full of tapes.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you followed me here, didn't you?}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{saw you in the street outside. you seemed interesting. is this where you live?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it's just a room...}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{so shall we begin?}
<P>__{(playfully, almost teasing)}
<D>__{what do you do?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i'm a vampire.}
<A>__{malloy laughs.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{see? i knew you were interesting. you mean this literally, i take it?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{absolutely. i was watching you watching me. i was waiting for you in that alleyway. and then you began to speak.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{well, what a lucky break for me.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{perhaps lucky for both of us.}
<A>__{still in shadow he turns from the window and approaches the table.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i will tell you my story. all of it. i'd like to do that very much.}
<A>__{malloy is uneasy as he studies the shadowy figure, fascinated but afraid.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{you were going to kill me? drink my blood?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yes but you needn't worry about that now. things change.}
<A>__{louis stands opposite, hand on the chair. malloy is riveted.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{you believe this, don't you? that you're a vampire? you really think...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we can't begin this way. let me turn on the light.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{but i thought vampires didn't like the light.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we love it. i only wanted to prepare you.}
<A>__{louis pulls the chord of the overhead naked light bulb. louis' face appears inhumanly white, eyes glittering. inhuman or not alive. the effect is subtle, beautiful and ghastly.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{good god!}
<A>__{he struggles to suppress fear and understand.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{don't be frightened. i want this opportunity.}
<A>__{the light appears to go out by itself and suddenly louis is in the chair, dimly lit by the street light from the window. the cassette is turning.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{how did you do that?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{the same way you do it. a series of simple gestures. only i moved too fast for you to see. i'm flesh and blood, you see. but not human. i haven't been human for two hundred years.}
<A>__{malloy is speechless, frightened yet enthralled.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what can i do to put you at ease? shall we begin like david copperfield? i am born, i grow up. or shall we begin when i was born to darkness, as i call it. that's really where we should start, don't you think?}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{you're not lying to me, are you?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{why should i lie? 1791 was the year it happened. i was twenty four younger than you are now.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{but times were different then. i was a man at that age. the master of a large plantation just south of new orleans...}

<L>__{exterior louisiana day (1791)}
<A>__{a disheveled louis, hair in pigtail, in deep pocket frock coat, rides his horse through the fields of indigo, passing an overseer and slaves at work. he passes slave quarters and the distant colonial mansion of pointe du lac. he comes to a small parish church and a graveyard. he dismounts and walks through the tombs to an elaborate one in greek style.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{i had just lost my wife in childbirth. she and the infant had been buried less than half a year.}
<A>__{there is a marble angel above the tomb, feminine, with a tiny cherub angel in her arms. louis looks from the angel, down to the inscriptions on the tomb: "dianne de pointe du lac 1763 1791 infant jean marie 1791" louis rips away the vines already covering the inscription, then drinks from a pocket flask. his face is ashen.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{i was twenty four and life seemed finished. i couldn't bear the pain of their loss. i longed for a release from it.}
<L>__{interior waterfront tavern night}
<A>__{louis in ragged lace and dirty brocade sitting between two whores at a gaming table, drinking absinthe. all around him flatboatmen, whores, gamblers, black african freedmen.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{i wanted to lose everything. my wealth, my estate, my sanity. but lady luck didn't oblige.}
<A>__{louis displays a hand of four aces. a gambler at the table stands in fury, over turning money, cards, drinks.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you're calling me a cheat?}
<C>__{gambler}
<D>__{i'm calling you a piece of shit }
<A>__{the gambler pulls out a pearl handled pistol and points it at louis. the crowd hushes and draws back. louis smiles drunkenly and stands. he rips open his lace shirt, exposing his chest.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{then do me a favor. get rid of this piece of shit...}
<A>__{the gambler's finger on the trigger. his hand shakes.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you lack the courage of your convictions, sir. do it.}
<A>__{lestat, a hooded figure in the corner, smiles from beneath the shadow of his hood. gleaming blue eyes.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{most of all i longed for death. i know that now. i invited it, a release from the pain of living...}
<A>__{the gambler lowers his gun, scowling. louis pockets the fistfulls of coins he has won.}
<L>__{exterior waterfront night}
<A>__{loud, crowded riverfront taverns full of ruffians. louis staggers down, an arm around a whore, drinking from a bottle. a pockmarked pimp follows behind.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{my invitation was open to anyone. sailors, thieves, whores and slaves...}
<L>__{exterior wharf night}
<A>__{louis, quite insensible, being propped up against a wall by the whore in a dank wharf over the water. the pimp rifles his pockets, then pulls a knife, about to slice his throat, when a shadow falls over him. he turns, and we see the face of lestat, who lifts him into the air by his throat, breaking his neck. the whore screams and lestat's other hand clamps over her mouth. lestat drags her towards him. louis falls to the ground, supported no more, insensible. close on his face, as we hear the last breaths of life of the whore, off.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{but it was a vampire that accepted.}
<B>__{in the water}
<A>__{the bodies of the thief and whore float by. above on the wharf, louis, now awake, stares down at them. he turns, to see lestat, towering above him.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{they would have killed you }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{then my luck would have changed.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you want death? is it death you want?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yes...}
<A>__{lestat floats down on top of him, then lifts him in the air, draws his head back by the hair and sinks his teeth in his neck. on louis' face every muscle rigid, teeth clenched, as the blood is drained from him.}
<B>__{on their feet}
<A>__{hovering above the ground, like two quivering dancers. the wind billows through the ghostly white sails and rigging of the boats around the wharf.}
<B>__{lestat}
<A>__{floats higher, with louis in his arms, draining his blood. one hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging from a shipmast. the other holds louis. he withdraws his teeth, and looks into louis' drained face.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you still want death? or have you tasted it enough?}
<A>__{louis can barely get the words out.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{enough...}
<A>__{lestat smiles and lets him go. louis falls and plummets into the water below. louis' face coming to the surface, in the water lapping by the wharf. the bodies of the whore and thief float beside him. he looks up and sees lestat way above him, dangling from the rope of the shipmast.}
<L>__{interior room san francisco}
<A>__{on malloy's face captivated, terrified, enthralled.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{that's how it happened?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{no. the gift of darkness requires more than that, as you'll see.}
<L>__{exterior waterfront day}
<A>__{louis floating by mudflats, surrounded by dead fish, the carcasses of animals, eighteenth century rubbish. he gets to his feet and walks weakly through the mudflats. the sun is coming up over the sea behind him.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{he left me half dead that morning. he wanted something from me. he came back the following night.}
<L>__{interior lavish french furnished bedroom at point du lac}
<A>__{louis is delirious in a four poster bed, shrouded with mosquito netting. a female slave, yvette, bathes his face with a rag. she is crying. other slave women hover in the shadows. yvette puts out all candles save one by the bed, and withdraws, with the others. candlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin. louis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring incoherently. then he opens his eyes. lestat, exquisitely dressed in french clothing, stands by the bed smiling. in the light of the candle we see that he is not human; skin too white; eyes too bright. lestat looks amiable, even mischievous, but impossible and angel or monster. louis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{who the hell are you? what are you doing in my house?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{and a beautiful house it is too. yours is a good life, isn't it?}
<A>__{louis takes aim. lestat puts his hand over the barrel. louis fires. the bullet tears a hole in lestat's hand. lestat is unfazed. he takes the gun from louis' hand and throws it away. his hand begins to heal.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you're not afraid of anything, are you?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{why should i be?}
<A>__{louis reaches for his sword, hanging by the bed, and point it. lestat laughs indulgently. he draws closer.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{are you going to put that through me too? ruin my beautiful clothes?}
<A>__{he comes closer to louis, right up to his face, so the sword passes through his waistcoat.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{were all last night's promises for nothing?}
<A>__{he reaches out with his now healed hand and plucks out the sword.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what do you want from me?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i've come to answer your prayers. you want to die, don't you? life has no meaning anymore, does it?}
<A>__{lestat sits down on the bed, drawing up one knee. louis is becoming spellbound.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{the wine has no taste. the food sickens you. there seems no reason for any of it, does there? but what if i could give it back to you? pluck out the pain and give you another life? and it would be for all time? and sickness and death could never touch you again?}
<A>__{the vampire theme rises, with the sound of a heartbeat.}

<L>__{exterior graveyard night}
<A>__{the camera drifts through the graveyard where louis' wife is buring. everything is lit with an eerie glow, as if seen through some unearthly eye.}

<D>__{vampires, that's what we are. creatures of darkness, only we see it that darkness more clearly than any mortal has ever seen...}
<A>__{louis and lestat drifting, dreamlike, through the overhanging vines, comes to the grave of his wife and child. above the crypt, the statue of angel, mother and child.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{wouldn't it be sweet to bid pain goodbye? to wave away anguish and grief? to embrace the peace of the unending night?}
<A>__{the marble fingers of the child on the statue move. the angel raises her head and has the face of louis wife, diane. she raises her hand and touches louis tear streamed face. the child speaks.}

<D>__{give it to me!!!}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{vampires. we thrive on blood.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i want it!}
<A>__{lestat bends close as if to drink louis' blood. louis does not shrink back, but stares into his eyes. lestat draws back, then stands up and goes to the french doors.}

<A>__{he looks outside.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{the sun's coming up. watch it carefully. if you come with me tomorrow, you'll never see it again.}
<A>__{he leaves. louis sits dazed, staring at the empty french window. the sun rises with unnatural beauty, over the swamplands and the plantation, filling the room, striking water pitcher, glass, mirror, and the picture of his dead wife.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{my last sunrise. that morning i was not yet a vampire, and i saw my last sunrise. i remember it completely, yet i don't remember any sunrise before it. i watched the whole magnificence of the dawn for the last time, as if it were the first. and the i said goodbye to sunlight and went out to become what i became.}
<L>__{exterior plantation night}
<A>__{lestat and louis walk through the slave quarters, huddles groups around fires, music, singing. the sound of whipping is heard.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{your grief has unhinged you. you've let your estate rot.}
<A>__{in the woods beyond the quarters, the white overseer is whipping a black slave, with horrifying savagery.}

<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{let's call that a start.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i can't do it.}
<C>__{lestat}

<A>__{backs away as lestat rises and descends the steps so fluidly he hardly seems to move.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{don't worry. he was white trash, they come at two a penny. i dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.}

<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(gently)}

<D>__{your perfect. your bitter and you're strong.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{but why do you want me?}

<D>__{yes. kill me. kill me like you promised }
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you asked for death. i didn't promise it }
<A>__{in a quiet rage, lestat raise his fist and shatters the marble face stone, revealing a coffin below. his fist shatters that in turn, revealing the half rotted body of a women, holding an infant, no longer recognizable as individuals, a tangle of gruesome rotted hair, flesh, eaten away lace, insects and worms crawling over it. louis gasps.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{it's not your wife and child my friend. it's death. just that simple. think and choose. it happens to everyone. except us.}
<A>__{lestat stares at him, smiling, becoming a hazy dreamlike vision, then hyperclear. louis again is spellbound. he drops the flask, which shatters on the stones. lestat appears angelic in his radiance.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{we shall be this way always, my friend. young as we are now. i'm lonely for a companion, lonely for your strength. but i'm not that lonely. do you want to come or not?}

<D>__{did i hear a yes?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yes...}
<A>__{lestat embraces louis, obscuring his face. he drinks his blood. we hear two heartbeats, out of sync, coming together. we see louis' face, growing paler, paler, as his blood is drained. his eyes stare upwards, losing their focus. louis' pov the moon, through hanging vines. the marble statue of his wife and child smile at him, as if come alive. her hair blows in the breeze, wonderful gold tresses, the child's fingers reach out...}

<A>__{lestat lets louis fall down beside the broken crypt. louis looks from the rotting bodies to lestat above him. radiant. lestat speaks gently.}

<D>__{sure...}
<A>__{louis rises to accept the first drops with his open mouth. lestat gathers him up, as louis clamps his hand on lestat's arm and drinks from the wrist. the vampire theme swells. lestat watches him drink his wrist with wry amusement. louis finishes, staggers away from him as if drunk. louis' pov vampire vision. the world is transformed, the swamp, the moon, the clouds, the cry of the night birds all come to him with unnatural clarity. he looks down with pity at the corpses of his wife and child who appear beautiful in death now rather than repulsive. he closes the lid of the coffin and replaces it in the ground, astonished at the ease of it. he turns and stares at lestat whom he sees now with vampire's vision. lestat's eyes are brighter, his buttons are glimmering in the light. everything is clearer, brighter, containing more facets of light and color.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{stop staring at my buttons. didn't i tell you it was going to be fun?}

<D>__{your wealth, dear louis, is inestimable. your income from cotton alone will keep us in comfort for a century.}
<A>__{louis just stares at him.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{i sat there staring at him with contempt. he had the soul of a shopkeeper, he was the sow's ear out of which nothing fine could be made. i felt sadly cheated in having him as a teacher...}

<C>__{louis }
<D>__{it was only as a vampire that i could see yvette's beauty. her fear of me increased my desire.}

<D>__{we can live like this? off the blood of animals?}

<D>__{yes, that's the melody, i remember it. oh yes...}

<C>__{mortal woman}
<D>__{i would take my chance. let me go! please...}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{and if you take that chance and live, what is your fate? the humpbacked toothless visage of old age?}
<A>__{santiago approaches her and tears the drawstring out of her peasant blouse. it opens completely and starts to slip. she tries to catch it, but gently stops her wrists. the blouse falls, exposing her young breasts.}

<D>__{this is monstrous!}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{yes, and very beautiful.}

<D>__{let me live, please. i don't care.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{then why should you care if you die now?}

<B>__{santiago}
<A>__{draws near her cheek.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{and suppose death had a heart to love and to release you? to whom would he turn his passion? would you pick a person from the crowd there? a person to suffer as you suffer?}

<A>__{shakes her head. she is helpless.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{we alone can give death meaning. do you know what it means to be loved by death, to become our bride?}
<A>__{mortal woman looks up on the verge of hysteria or fainting. but then her eyes mist over. she is being entranced.}
<B>__{from her pov}
<A>__{we realize she is looking past santiago at the divinely beautiful armand, who has just stepped out of the wings. armand has entranced her. he passes santiago. santiago stiffens, but yields the stage.}

<C>__{mortal woman}

<D>__{be still!}
<B>__{on the stage}

<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the audience, milling towards the exits. they talk in vacuous terms about the beauty of the show, the symbolism of it, the daring of it as they leave. gradually louis and claudia are left alone in the empty theatre. louis seems anxious to leave. claudia whispers in his ear.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{patience, louis. patience.}
<A>__{he looks around the empty theatre, more eerie now than when the play was on. the red curtain shifts slightly in a hidden breeze, a candle sputters and dies in a box. then the candle flares again, and we see armand in the box, looking down on them. he stares with a dreamy expression, saying nothing.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we've been searching for you for a very long time...}
<A>__{his voice echoes eerily. armand gestures for them to follow him.}

<A>__{armand leading, louis and claudia following. it opens into a }
<B>__{huge underground ballroom}
<A>__{walls are painted with famous copies of durer, brueghel, goya and bosch depictions of death. fine wooden coffins line the walls. candles burn in sconces, casting alternate shadows and pools of light. armand walks through, gesturing louis and claudia to follow him. as they walk through, vampire man and women appear out of the shadows like wraiths, startling them, drifting around them, stroking them, touching claudia as if she were a doll. shrieks of preternatural laughter. armand gestures to the vampires to back off. all obey but estelle.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{such a darling.}
<A>__{she menaces claudia, her breasts enormous, her fangs bared. armand throw her a look, and she is flung against the wall. louis stares around. the vampires faces drift towards him and away, always disclosing the face of armand, who seems some distance away, but strangely close, staring at louis with a constantly calm, hypnotic gaze. then a young mortal boy comes from the shadows with a candelabra, which he hands to armand. armand and the boy come towards them, leading them along the walls, his candelabra illuminating the ghastly murals, his face gleaming like an angel above the candleflame.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{monstrous.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{yes, and very beautiful.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{your lips, they didn't move.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{they did, but too fast for you to see them. no magic, just grace and speed.}
<A>__{the boy is watching louis. armand's hand beckons and the boy draws up to louis in the candlelight. he places his arms on louis' shoulders. louis glances at armand, who smiles. louis sees the puncture marks on the boy's neck.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{he wants you...}
<A>__{louis is utterly confused. can't resist. drinks his blood. the boy's body presses against him, sensual, willing. the other vampires appear all around louis, who suddenly senses it and draws away, ashamed. claudia watches warily, from a distance. armand beckons at her and louis and open a door in the wall which reveals a stone staircase.}
<L>__{interior medieval room}
<A>__{medieval chairs, table, an old coffin, a bed in one corner, a blazing fire. a medieval painting of satan, being banished from heaven, above the fire. armand places the boy on the bed, settling him so he sleeps.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{disappointing, isn't it? to come so far and find so little. jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make believe...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we had feared we were the only ones...}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{but how did you come into existence?}
<A>__{he glances at louis, then at claudia, who averts her eyes.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{you don't want to answer... two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{are you the leader of this group?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{if there were a leader, i would be the one.}
<A>__{claudia stares at him constantly, guarded.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{so you have the answers...}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{ah! you have questions?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what are we?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{nothing if not vampires...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{who made us what we are?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{surely you know the one who made you...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{but the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...}
<A>__{louis looks at the picture. armand watches him.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{that is a picture, nothing more.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you mean we are not children of satan?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he smiles at louis. a smile of infinite compassion.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{i understand. i saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. i saw you with the boy. you die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. but does that make you evil? or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{then there is nothing.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{perhaps...}
<A>__{he passes his finger through the candle flame.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{and perhaps this is the only real evil left...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{then god does not exist...}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{i have not spoken to him...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and no vampire here has discourse with god or the devil?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{none that i've ever known. i know nothing of god or the devil, i have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. and as far as i know, after four hundred years i am the oldest living vampire in the world.}
<A>__{he stares at them, his face angelic, hypnotic, young. his eyes hold them both in a trance.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{my god... so it's as i always feared. nothing, leading to nothing.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{you fell too much. so much you make me feel...}
<A>__{he stares from claudia to louis. he seems to be reading their souls.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{the one who made you should have told you this. the one who left the old world for the new...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{he knew nothing. he just didn't care.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{knew? you mean he is...}
<A>__{claudia appears suddenly to louis' shoulder, interrupting.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{come, beloved. it's time we were on our way. i'm hungry and the city waits.}
<A>__{she stares hard at armand. armand looks from her to louis.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{so soon to go?}
<A>__{he seems genuinely regretful. but claudia pulls louis out.}
<L>__{interior darkened corridors and theatre night}
<A>__{louis and claudia feel their way through darkened corridors, trying to find their way out.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{the place was dark as we left, a darkness that confounded even claudia. and as we blundered through it, again came the thought: i have wronged lestat, i have hated him for the wrong reasons.}
<A>__{suddenly a light comes on. they see they are in the empty theatre. santiago stands on the stage, under a candle.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{how did you wrong him?}
<A>__{louis is stunned.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you read my thoughts?}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{you said a name }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{a name i don't want to say again.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{i seemed to recognize it...}
<A>__{other vampires appear behind him.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{there is but one crime among us vampires here.}
<A>__{he looks at claudia.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{you should know, who are so secretive about the vampire who made you.}
<A>__{claudia laughs.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{boredom!}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{it is the crime that means death to any vampire. to kill your own kind!}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{aaaah! i was so afraid it was to be born like venus out of the foam, as we were! come louis, let's go!}
<L>__{exterior hotel saint gabriel night}
<A>__{claudia and louis enter the lobby.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i loathe them! i can't stand the sight of them! stupid bourgeois parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! i've searched for them the world over and i despise them!}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what danger?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i can feel it from them! they want to know who made us, what became of him. they have their rules, their idiotic rules!}
<A>__{they come to their room, enter.}
<L>__{interior hotel rooms night}

<C>__{louis}
<D>__{do you think i would let them harm you?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{no, you would not, louis. danger hold you to me.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{love holds you to me. and we are in danger, not you.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{love?}
<A>__{she smiles at him. a strange, sad, adult smile.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you would leave me for armand if he beckoned you.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{never.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{he wants you as you want him. he's been waiting for you. he wants you for a companion. he bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{that's not so.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? when he put me in that trance...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{so you felt it too!}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{let him go, he said. let him go.}
<A>__{she touches his face.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{is that what i should do louis? let you go? my father? my lover? my louis, who made me?}
<A>__{there are tears in her eyes. louis lifts her up in his arms.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{he can protect us, claudia.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you really believe that?}
<L>__{exterior doll ship night}
<A>__{claudia, staring at the dolls. we see madeleine inside, painting a doll. she sees claudia and smiles and waves.}
<L>__{interior theatre night}
<A>__{louis, sitting alone in the box, as the curtains draw back, to show santiago as death, as before. louis takes advantage of the darkness to slip away.}

<C>__{armand}
<D>__{i was waiting for you...}

<C>__{louis}
<D>__{claudia is dear to me. my... daughter.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{your lover.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{no, my beloved, my child.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{if you say so. you are innocent.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i'm not innocent. but i'm afraid. she feels she's in danger from the others.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{she is.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{but why?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{i could give you reasons. her silence. her youth. it's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{then blame the one who made her...}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{did you kill this vampire who made you both? is that why you won't say his name? santiago thinks you did.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we want no quarrel with him.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{it's already begun. if you want to save her, send her away.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{then i leave too.}
<A>__{armand smiles.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{so soon? without any of those answers you so longed for?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you said there were none.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{but you asked the wrong questions. do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? how quickly they perish of their own will.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we can do that?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{you would never give up life. if the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. you see too clearly. you see too much.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{that's what the one who made me said.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{how he must have loved you.}
<A>__{armand suddenly grips louis close to him.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{louis, i need you more than he ever did. i need a link with this century. the world changes. we do not. therein lies the irony that ultimately kills us. i need you to make contact with this age.}
<A>__{louis laughs bitterly.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{he? don't you see? i'm not the spirit of any age! i'm at odds with everything and always have been! i'm not even sure what i am!}
<A>__{armand smiles.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{but louis, that is the very spirit of your age. the heart of it. you fall from grace has been the fall of a century.}
<A>__{louis is stunned.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and the vampires of the theatre?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{like moths around the candle of the age. decadent, useless. they can't reflect anything. but you do. you reflect its broken heart.}
<A>__{louis is speechless.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{are these not the answers you came for?}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{yes... my god...}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{a vampire with a human soul. an immortal with a mortal's passion. you are beautiful, my friend. lestat must have wept when he made you }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{lestat! you knew lestat!}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{yes i knew him. knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.}
<A>__{armand stands. he takes louis by the arm, leads him towards the back wall.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{but you must go now. you must get her safely out of paris.}
<A>__{he opens a hidden door in the wall.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{no one else knows of this door. when you knock you will find me waiting...}
<L>__{exterior theatre des vampires night}
<A>__{louis, in the street outside, as the door closes behind him.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{i felt a kind of peace at last. i had found the teacher which lestat could never, i knew now, have been. i knew knowledge would never be withheld by armand. it would pass through him as through a pane of glass. and i knew claudia must leave me...}
<L>__{interior hotel suite night}
<A>__{louis enters. there is unfamiliar scent in the air, a doll sitting by the mirror. louis looks in the mirror and sees...}
<B>__{madeleine}
<A>__{the doll maker, resplendent in green taffeta, sitting like a madonna with claudia on her lap. claudia's arms are wound round her neck. the contrast between mortal woman and immortal child is plain.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{madeleine... louis is shy.}
<A>__{madeleine rises and comes towards louis. she draws back the lace fringes round her throat, so he can see the two marks there. she says softly, dreamily.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{drink.}
<A>__{louis turns away. claudia speaks, icy, from the bed.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{do it louis. because i cannot do it. i haven't the strength. you saw to that when you made me.}
<A>__{louis turns to madeleine.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you haven't the vaguest conception under god of what you ask!}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{au contraire, monsieur, i have.}

<D>__{you have found your new companion, louis! you will make me mine!}
<A>__{louis grips madeleine and shakes her.}

<D>__{how do we seem to you? do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? drink, you ask me! have you any idea of the thing you will become?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{your evil is that you cannot be evil! and i will suffer for it no longer!}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{don't make me, claudia! i cannot do it!}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{yet you could do it to me! snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy tale! couldn't you have waited? six more years and i would have had that shape! and now you weep! you haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.}
<A>__{she points to madeleine}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you give her to me! do this before you leave me!}
<A>__{she begins to weep, sobbing like a child.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{oh god! i love you still, that's the torment of it. but you know i must leave you louis...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yes...}

<D>__{what do you think she is, madeleine? a doll?}
<C>__{madeleine}

<D>__{my daughter...}
<A>__{louis takes her chin in his hand, gently.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{look at the gaslight. don't take your eyes off it. you will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. do you hear me?}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{yes!}
