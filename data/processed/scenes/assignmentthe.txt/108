<L>__{exterior shore of dead sea israel sunset}
<A>__{ramirez and amos walk along the road which runs straight along the dead sea. here and there are strands of barbed wire and the barracks in the b.g. as they walk, they pass a sign which says: the dead sea you are now standing at the lowest spot on earth... elevation: 393 meters below sea level.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{jack doesn't know that we're having this talk and i don't want him to know... understand?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{okay...}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{nothing can make you ready for combat but combat. jack would be against me telling you this... he would say you shouldn't have a thought in your head that we haven't put there but you're not just a box that we're going to fill up with our own ideas. you have a right to know certain things.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i appreciate that amos... a lot. it's funny, i started out hating you... i mean i'm still gonna sue you, don't think you're off the hook for my broken ribs, but...}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{but now you love me and we're going to run away to san francisco and find a reformed rabbi to perform a mixed gay marriage. listen to me... you're going to feel more alone than you've ever felt in your life. it will hit you all of a sudden and you'll think your heart's going to jump out of your chest, you'll think everyone around you can hear your heart beating, and that everyone around you is an enemy agent. i want you to be prepared for that. so you can deal with it. understand?}
<A>__{in the far distance, we are vaguely aware of a huge truck barreling along, coming straight down the highway towards them.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{we had an agent... the best we ever had in training. we were going to infiltrate him into beirut and then use him to penetrate the pflp. no student ever scored higher than this man... we set up his cover for six months in argentina. he was perfect. and then we sent him to beirut. he got off the plane, went to his hotel, went up to his room and had a nervous breakdown.}
<A>__{suddenly it seems, the truck is right on top of them, heading straight for them, like monster in a child's nightmare. it passes within inches and ramirez has to fight to keep from jumping as the truck roars past them. it is not a monster, just a truck. then again, it could have killed them just the same.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{we had to mount an operation to send in a man posing as a doctor so we could drug him and get him out on a plane. okay? now you understand? nothing prepares you. i want you to know that so when it hits you, you don't panic, you feel the fear and then get rid of it.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{jesus...}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{you splash some water on your face. you take some deep breaths. you look in the mirror and when you look in that mirror, i don't want you to find annibal ramirez. you find carlos. if you find carlos, that's what everyone else will find too. and if you find carlos and anything goes wrong, he's the one who can get you out of it. because he's the best.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{i got a wife i got to go back to when this is over. i got kids i got to go back to when this is over. i want to go back as annibal ramirez... not carlos.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{you will... you'll need a time of decompression and it will be hard at first, but you will. because inside you aren't carlos... you aren't a terrorist. but right now, in order to save your life, you've got to be. you've got to look in the mirror and find carlos. do you understand?}
<A>__{it is almost said like the offering of a vow.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{you won't be able to go in with a gun... too risky... so we're going to have to get one to you once you're in place. how i don't know yet... but we'll get one to you. you'll make your way out by boat. we'll be on it. but we won't be able to help if anything goes wrong. we'll make our way down the coast to a friendly state and then fly back to london, and from there back to the u.s.}
