<L>__{ext interior diner moments later}
<A>__{he comes out of the diner, crosses the street toward tango, who's buying fruit. greets him cheerfully }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hey, tango, what's up. i was just thinking about you.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{i was looking at the jar and you know what? i didn't see nothing in it.}
<C>__{tango}
<D>__{the fuck you want, frank }
<A>__{before the last word is out of tango's mouth, frank's got a gun pressed against his forehead. silence. everyone backs away the bodyguard, too. tango's girl pulls her arm from his and takes off. eventually }
<C>__{tango}
<D>__{what're you going to do, boy? shoot me in broad daylight? in front of everyone?}
<A>__{it's as if life on the street has stopped. no one moves; everyone is looking at frank; maybe that's what he wants. as tango laughs at the thought }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, that's right.}
<A>__{frank pulls the trigger and the big man falls back like someone hit with a board. frank stands over him and empties the gun in his chest, the shots echoing down the street. then it's quiet again. everyone's still looking him, but frank doesn't run. instead, he calmly reaches into tango's suit pocket, takes out a money clip thick with cash, drops it in the "jar" and sets it next to the body.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{for the cops. should be enough.}
<A>__{frank returns to the diner and sits back down, ignoring the astonished stares from his brothers and everyone else in the place. tries to remember where he was in his lecture as he tucks the napkin back in his shirt collar.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that basically's the whole picture right there.}
