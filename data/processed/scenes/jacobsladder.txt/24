<L>__{interior jacob's kitchen day}
<A>__{jacob and jezzie are sitting at the breakfast table. jezzie is reading the national enquirer and chewing at her lip. suddenly a drop of blood forms and falls onto the formica table top. staring at it for a moment, she wipes it with her finger and then licks it with her tongue. jacob is nursing a cup of coffee and staring out the window at the housing project across the way. the toaster pops. jezzie jumps. she gets up, butters her toast, and returns to her paper.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{says here the world's comin' to an end. the battle of heaven and hell they call it. should be quite a show; fireworks, h bombs, and everything. you believe them, jake?}
<A>__{jacob doesn't answer.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{me neither ... god, look at this. two heads. only lived two days. a day for each head. could you imagine me with two heads? we'd probably keep each other up all night arguing and whatnot. you wanna see the picture?}
<A>__{he does not respond. jezzie gets up and walks over to jacob. standing in front of him she slowly unties her robe and lets it fall apart. she is naked underneath it. sensuously she leans forward, unbuttons his shirt, and strokes his chest. she waits for a response from him, but there is none. he sits silently, disinterested. furious, jezzie turns away. grabbing the vacuum cleaner from the broom closet she angrily unravels the cord and switches it on. breasts flash from beneath her gown as the vacuum roars back and forth across the floor.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{goddamn you son of a bitch! my uncle's dogs used to treat me better than you do. at least they'd lick my toes once in a while. at least they showed some fucking interest.}
<A>__{a neighbor bangs on the wall, shouting.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{all right! all right! all right!}
<A>__{jacob peers at the courtyard eighteen stories below and watches the patterns of early morning movement. tiny figures drift purposefully over the concrete. suddenly the vasuum cleaner goes off. in the silence, jacob realizes that jezzie is crying and turns to see her curled over the kitchen table. he walks to her side and strokes her hair. jezzie begins to sob. after a moment she looks at him with puffy eyes.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{you love me?}
<A>__{he nods his head "yes." she smiles coyly and rubs her hair like a kitten against his crotch. after a few moments she speaks.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{della's party's tonight. why don't we go? it'll take your minf offa things. and i won't make you dance. i promise. huh?}
<P>__{(he nods his head in}
<D>__{consent. jezzie hugs}
<P>__{him)}
<D>__{you still love me, jake?}
<A>__{he nods his head again, only heavily, as though the question exhausts him.}
