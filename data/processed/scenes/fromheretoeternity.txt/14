<B>__{medium shot prew and choate}
<A>__{in b.g. a few of the men are moving to and from the latrine but most of them are in their bunks. over shot the sound of a bugle blowing tattoo is heard. lights are being extinguished in various parts of the room. prew and choate are lying on adjoining bunks, smoking. choate's voice is almost linked to his last speech of preceding scene.}
<C>__{cho ate}
<D>__{... oh, sure, we got a few bad non coms and we got dynamite holmes for a captain. but i been around twenty years in this army. they even up.}
<A>__{in b. g. warden and sergeant pete (pop) karelsen come through from the latrine. the latter is a grizzled, crumbled dog face, about fifty.}
<C>__{choate}
<D>__{take a compny. they got the best compny commander i ever saw. but their topkick he ain't no warden.}
<A>__{warden stops beside prew and karelsen moves on, going in to a small room off the main squadroom. warden's big, powerful body is covered only by a towel around his loins. he smiles at prew.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{hello, kid. everythin nice and comfy?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{never better.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{'at's the lull before the storm, kid. set yourself.}
<A>__{he moves off, goes into the room he shares with karelsen.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{what's the deal with him, anyway? i can't figure him.}
<A>__{the lights are almost all off and activity in the room has ended.}
<C>__{choate}
<D>__{the warden? he's a wild man. he was in the 15th when they seen their action in the settlement in shanghai. i heard about it down in the philippes even. he got himself a dsc and a purple heart out of it but you'd never know it if i dint tell you. this next war comes, warden'll be right in there, standin up on the skyline, trio to get himself killed, but nothing will ever touch him. he'll come through maddern, wildern, craziern ever. all i know is he's the best soljer i ever saw...}
