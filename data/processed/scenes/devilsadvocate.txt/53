<P>__{(pacing the window)}
<D>__{this room we're in was built architecturally designed to promote healthy group dynamics. a psychic centrifuge. makes you want to reach out, doesn't it? inclusion. commonality. synergy. all that good shit. that's what i'm looking for today. because when i hear stories the kind of stories i've been hearing about backbiting, about partners not working together, departments cutting each other's throats over clients, or worse... i feel drained. it drains me. i feel empty. i feel as though i've let you all down.}
