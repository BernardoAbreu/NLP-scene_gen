<L>__{interior gaming room night}
<A>__{shots of sir william cosgrove being wheeled in, and at play with roderick, and some other gentlemen.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{i made sir william cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play table. one could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.}
<C>__{sir william}
<D>__{hang it, mr. roderick james, you have no more manners than a barber, and i think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and i like you, sir. because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.}
<A>__{laughter at the table.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i am obliged to observe, sir william cosgrove, that since you are bound for the next world much sooner than i am, i will depend on you to get comfortable quarters arranged for me.}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{sir william}
<D>__{indeed, you are right, sir. look at me. marriage has added forty years to my life. i am dying, a worn out cripple, at the age of fifty. when i took off lady cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself. fool that i was! i had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in europe and i gave up all these, and married and was miserable. take a warning from me, mr. roderick, and stick to the trumps. do anything, but marry.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{would you have me spend my life all alone?}
<C>__{sir william}
<D>__{in truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.}
<C>__{roderick}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{the milkmaid's daughter?}
<C>__{sir william}
<D>__{well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? no man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance. for instance, i have got the gout; who tends me? a hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power. my wife never comes near me. what friend have i? none in the wide world. men of the world, as you and i are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.}
<A>__{polite laughter at the table.}
<C>__{sir william}
<D>__{my lady is a weak woman, but she is my mistress. she is a fool, but she has got the better of one of the best heads in christendom. she is enormously rich, but somehow i have never been so poor, as since i married her. i thought to better myself, and she has made me miserable and killed me, and she will do as much for my successor when i'm gone.}
<A>__{there is a reflective silence at the table.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{has her ladyship a very large income?}
<A>__{this question causes sir william to burst out into a yelling laugh, joined by the rest of the table, and makes roderick blush not a little at his gaucherie.}
