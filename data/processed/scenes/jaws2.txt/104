<L>__{exterior amity waterfront street day}
<A>__{ellen and brody are in the jeep; he's driving her to work. there's a crowd at dockside, and the town ambulance's now familiar blinking red light. brody, out of force of habit, wheels the jeep towards the action, nudging through the crowd, which gives way to the official blue and white vehicle.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{hey it's not your job any more. i'm going to be late for work.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{just one minute...}
<A>__{he gets out, and pushes through the crowd, ellen following.}
<B>__{dockside}
<A>__{the dive boat is moored at a clumsy angle next to the police boat, where hendricks has been pulling routine maintenance. the police launch is cluttered with tools and spare parts; some non essential piece of gear is stripped and laid out on the deck. hendricks is on the dive boat, kneeling next to andrews.}
<B>__{aboard the dive boat}
<A>__{andrews is shaking, bloody froth on his lips and chest. the shaken divers are huddled together, an ambulance attendant is wheeling a gurney into position. crosby and sparky are stunned.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what the hell happened?}
<C>__{sparky}
<D>__{embolism. air bubbles in his blood. came up too damn fast. held his goddamn breath!}
<A>__{he is near collapse himself.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{easy...}
<C>__{crosby}
<D>__{he panicked! something scared him!}
<A>__{an ambulance attendant is putting a blanket around sparky.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{it's okay. we're taking care of him.}
<A>__{the other attendant holds something out to brody. brody examines it; a scuba mouthpiece, bitten in two, useless.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{how'd this happen?}
<C>__{sparky}
<D>__{bite reflex, like a spasm.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{right after, the kids went out?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{what kids? who went out?}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{all of them. mike, junior vaughn, brookie peters, pat, lucy all that whole gang.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{mike? our mike?}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{yep. looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{how long ago?}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{about an hour, maybe two.}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{let's see i came on about eight...}
<A>__{brody is gone, pushing through the crowd.}
<B>__{the police boat}
<A>__{brody is casting off lines. ellen is on the dock, watching him.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{what're you doing?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{going out.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{uh, chief look. you're not chief any more.}
<A>__{brody keeps working, making ready for sea.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{i can't let you take her out.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you can't stop me.}
<A>__{ellen is climbing aboard, taking off her heels.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{mrs. brody, look if he can't go, then you can't go. neither of you can go.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i'm going.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{mike's out there.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{but i signed for the boat. you're not authorized any more.}
<A>__{brody starts the engines with a roar, and slams it into reverse. the boat starts out of the slip, then lunges to a halt, shuddering on its still fastened bow mooring line.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{untie that rope.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{please. it's my job.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i will do it.}
<A>__{and she moves purposefully towards the boat cleat.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{mrs. brody, please...}
<A>__{brody is shifting gears, the boat is crabbing sideways as he puts the helm hard over. it bumps the dock, hard.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{you're too close. back off.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{goddamnit, hendricks, untie the rope there.}
<A>__{hendricks goes to the bow, jumps aboard and frees the bow line. the boat slips into reverse, the water boiling as brody guns it away from the dock.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{let me. please.}
<A>__{he takes the wheel, eases off on the rudder, and comes about, pointing the launch out to sea.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{hurry, please.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{what the hell, they can't fire both of us someone's got to be in charge, right? which way are we going?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{find the kids. the lighthouse you said something about the lighthouse. get us there.}
<B>__{wide on the harbor}
<A>__{the amity police boat, brody, ellen and hendricks aboard, is headed under full power out to sea. hendricks is pumping the horn, warning boats out of the way, ignoring the rules of the road; as small boats scatter out of the way, we can see the ambulance, red light flashing, pushing out slowly through the crowd at dockside.}
