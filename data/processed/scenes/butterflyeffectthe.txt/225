<A>__{evan wakes up with a bloody nose. he grabs a pillow and covers his head with it as a flood of memories seizes him. lenny (looking fit) grabs a towel from atop an award winning flatworms project and hands it to evan.}
<C>__{lenny }
<D>__{you alright? should i call the doctor?}
<A>__{evan groans and shakes his head "no". he rides out the pain like a seasoned pro. when it finally subsides, he lowers the pillow and smiles feebly.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i will think i will be alright this time.}
<P>__{(a new hope)}
<D>__{i really do.}
<A>__{lenny nods, still concerned.}
