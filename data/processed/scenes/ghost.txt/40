<A>__{the door slams shut. sam is locked inside. frightened and desperate, he rushes for the door knob. his hand sinks through it. there is a strange sound, like electrical static, as it penetrates the metal and wood. frightened, he yanks it back. sam circles the space several times and then returns to the door. clenching his teeth, he reaches out again. as his hand pushes up against it, we sense that he experiences a subtle resistance. the hairs on the back of his hand vibrate as his ghostly form presses into it. we sense sam's fear as his entire arm disappears from view. the grating electrical sound shudders up his spine. the sight of his amputated limb is unsettling but sam does not pull back. slowly he edges in and presses his face into the molecules of the wood.}
