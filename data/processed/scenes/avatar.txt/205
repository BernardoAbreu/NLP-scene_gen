<L>__{exterior well of souls dawn}
<A>__{the well of souls is a deep caldera 100 meters across. it is ringed with enormous willows whose roots seem to pour down the sheer rock walls like candle wax. at the bottom, in a natural amphitheater, the omaticaya refugees are clustered around a central rock outcropping which forms a kind of dais and altar. shafts of dawn light reach to the bottom of the grotto, lighting a single willow the mother tree. ancient and gnarled, it grows in the center of the rock. its roots spread down to the grotto floor, where they merge with the roots of the willows ringing the well forming a braided mat resembling the surface of a brain. mo'at stands on the dais, leading them in a chant.}
