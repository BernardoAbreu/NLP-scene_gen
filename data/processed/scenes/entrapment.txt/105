<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{mac and gin running full tilt through the siren blare, turning a corner to see ahead... ...the balcony railing, the building's empty central core. mac bolts straight toward it, gin sprinting to follow, lungs pounding, they reach the railing, looking down to see... hysteria, unimaginable chaos. soldiers, black tie partygoers, scrambling in all directions, looking to his left mac sees... ...the bank of elevators, soldiers pouring in, some cars already rising, fourth floor, fifth. now he looks directly below, where... ...soldiers are pounding up the metal service staircase, the front rank almost at the third floor. in the lobby, some faces look up to see us, but no one is shooting.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{they don't know we're the bad guys.}
<A>__{he plunges his hand into her shoulder bag...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{time they find out.}
<A>__{pulls out two plasma grenades, and flings one toward the elevator cables three floors down and it... ...explodes in a horrifying fireball, causing pandemonium in the lobby below, the elevator cables blown away, cars plunging, the yellow smoke momentarily screening us from the soldiers far below, and mac hurls the second grenade... ...straight down and the fireball wipes out the staircase, a huge section of ninth floor landing raining down on the lobby.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{okay. how do we get down?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{down? i never liked down.}
<A>__{grabs her hand and they race to the staircase, as smoke billows everywhere below. up they go, two stairs at a time, the lowest glass and spiderweb steel canopy is three floors above us, the cacophany of shouts below is like an amplified insane asylum. he is dragging her now, up, up, bullets are flying blind through the smoke, chewing up metal and glass all around us, up, up, and as the smoke at last clears, they have reached... ...the canopy floor. they can see the army down below. clutching her hand, mac leads her over the railing, onto the canopy itself, and together they run... ...straight across the heavy glass toward the far side of the building, like space walking above the throng 150 feet below, bullets now tracing their path from beneath, slamming off the underside of the bulletproof canopy, gin shrieking with fright as they go. we see ahead... ...three executive elevators beginning to climb the far wall. these are glass enclosed tubes, all filled with soldiers, the car in the lead already at the tenth floor. mac keeps running straight toward them.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{we've got one more grenade!}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{save it for a rainy day!}
<A>__{they make it to the edge of the canopy, the lead elevator only two floors below them. we can see the soldiers through the glass. mac grasps her hand, and as the car nears our level...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you can do this.}
<A>__{they leap across five feet of open air to... ...land squarely on the car's metal roof, mac wrapping his free arm around the cable, and up we go. the ant colony below us receding fast. gin is hanging onto the cable, petrified. mac is looking up toward the roof.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{okay, now what?}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{shut up. you're on a 'need to know' basis.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{mac, i'm sorry.}
<A>__{he looks at her. just now, she seems more miserable than afraid.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{turns out, i'm a screw up.}
<A>__{he doesn't smile. passing the third canopy.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{well. something to be said for being self aware.}
<A>__{looks back up. forty first floor. six to go.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{may i have the last grenade, dear. it's about to rain.}
<A>__{she blinks. huh? so he reaches into her bag, pulls out the grenade, and throws it... ...straight up. the roof above them explodes in a fireball, and shields her body against the wall of their shaft, as a huge section of roof comes raining down. we watch as it... ...crashes through the upper canopy, tons of roof and glass plunging to... ...blast through the middle canopy, everyone below scrambling for shelter, as the whole shebang... ...explodes through the lowest canopy. gin can only gape at the incredible display. mouthing a silent wow. they've passed the second canopy, thirty sixth floor. still climbing. the other two elevators maybe five floors below us.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you see, banking will be more democratic under china.}
<A>__{she looks to him.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{well. no more glass ceiling.}
<A>__{the elevator car has stopped. we are at the roof. the soldiers are in the car beneath our feet, nowhere to get out. above our heads. ...the last few feet of elevator cable. and starry sky, where our patch of roof used to be.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{how refreshing. the night air.}
<A>__{he begins to shimmy up the few feet of cable. at the top, he reaches out with one hand toward the lip of the remaining roof, grabs it, lunges with his free hand, and... ...dangling 47 floors, he pulls himself up, swings onto the roof. reaches back down. she is only twelve feet below him. frozen with fear.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i can't do this.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you can. if i say so.}
<A>__{she stares up at his eyes. he smiles.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{if you stay. you'll have to pay for the damage...}
<A>__{she looks down at the mess below. and starts to climb the cable. not so easy in a ball gown, but the adrenaline is pumping. gets to the top. here's the hard part. one hand reaches out... ...grabs his. she lets go. and she is dangling in space.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{now that split. did we say 60 40?}
<A>__{and with all his strength, hauls her up onto... ...the roof. two thirds of it remain. at the far edge, a gigantic maintenance crane, itself two stories high. but between here and the crane... ...a helicopter. big and beautiful and empty. she looks like she's seen god. mac starts to jog toward it, she runs to follow but sees him go... ...straight past the chopper.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{he turns back. she points to the copter. it's over here.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{got the keys?}
<A>__{oh.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i thought you could...hot wire stuff?}
<A>__{guess not.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{they fix those things so you can't steal them...}
<A>__{and keeps walking. toward the monster crane.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{these, they're not so worried.}
<A>__{moving fast, he points off to his right. her eyes follow a long cable, leading from the arm of the crane, across the roof, attaching by a huge hook to a massive wrecking ball.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{go grab that hook.}
<A>__{he reaches the crane's cab. turns back to see she hasn't moved.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{let me rephrase that. run and grab that hook. or die ...}
<A>__{got it? she takes off running. he hops in the cab. pushes the start button. it rumbles to life. tests some levers...}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{shit! don't do that!}
<A>__{he turns to see that he's tightened the cable, pulling her ball six feet in the air. she clings to the hook with a true death grip. he lowers her ball to the roof. getting the hang of it.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{this only works if you shut your eyes.}
<A>__{which makes her eyes bug out.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you're not gonna lower me over the side.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{of course not. now close baby eyes...}
<P>__{(she won't)}
<D>__{suit yourself.}
<A>__{he throws a lever and the crane's arm begins to swing in a circle, finally taking the ball with it, and as she screams, mac... ...pounces out of the cab, racing along the edge of the roof, not toward the ball which is sweeping the hysterical gin in a widening arc, but toward the point where he thinks the ball will clear the edge, and just as it does, he... ...leaps aboard, throwing one arm around the hook, the other around her, and they go... ...over the side, whooshing down in a gigantic, every increasing loop, as the endless steel cable unwinds from its huge drum like a fishing reel hooked onto a killer whale.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{oh noooooooooo....}
<A>__{the ride no theme park could insure, swooping out across the skyline, dropping like an anvil, as the cable unspools hundreds of feet, nothing but nothing for miles below them, gin grabbing a breath to shriek her guts out, as the monstrous pendulum reaches its max, begins to slow toward that one nauseating motionless instant...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{let go now!!}
<A>__{he yanks her loose, and they drop... ...four feet. the ball swings off lnto space to some unknown mayhem. clutching mac, gin looks way down to the street, and realizes they are standing on... ...a rooftop. quiet, safe. alone.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{planning.}
<A>__{she whips around, glaring death at his eyes.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{and dumb luck.}
<A>__{she collapses in his arms, every muscle trembling in spasm, sobbing...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{god, i hate you.}
<A>__{he holds her tenderly. kisses the top of her head.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{good. i hate you, too.}
