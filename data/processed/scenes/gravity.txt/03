<D>__{okay. okay. okay. okay, ohh i got it.}

<C>__{ryan }

<A>__{the tether tenses and she stops nine feet away from matt. matt ignites the thrusters, tugging ryan behind him. but this proves a difficult endeavor as her momentum drags him, changing his direction.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{see? where you go, i go.}
<A>__{matt ignites a new thrust to re direct his position. as he does so ryan's change of momentum makes him swing again.}

<D>__{better. let's get out of here.}
<A>__{using his thrusters, matt negotiates a new position and, igniting a long thrust, he jets away. ryan cannot repress the anger boiling up, and she screams }

<D>__{i know what you mean.}

<A>__{they descend, gliding through pieces of debris. among the space junk, a solar panel from the hubble is distinguished. matt eyes a small dot in the distance: the shuttle.}

<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{why aren't they answering?}

<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we don't know. that's why we keep talking. if someone is listening they might just save your life. set your watch for ninety minutes.}
<A>__{matt reaches for a digital watch strapped to his wrist and sets up the timer for 90 minutes.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{why ninety?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{houston clocked that debris at fifty thousand miles per hour. factoring in our current orbit, i reckon we've got 90 minutes before we play duck and cover again.}

<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{you did all right.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{matt }
<P>__{(to the shuttle)}
<D>__{houston, in the blind. this is kowalsky. our current location is approximately 900 meters out from the explorer. dr. stone and i would like to retrieve the body of mission specialist shariff and return it to shuttle. am i a go to retrieve?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{roger that.}
<A>__{matt changes direction and approaches shariff. he has to ignite several small thrusts to try and steady his direction, fighting against ryan's momentum.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{where is he? where is he?}
<A>__{shariff's body is tethered to a panel that was ripped away from the explorer. matt approaches the panel and ignites the thrusters to slow down his course, and he grabs onto it. ryan, continuing her momentum, crashes against shariff's body. the contact slows her trajectory, but it throws shariff away, his tether tensing, pulling the panel with him.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{oh, my god. oh, my god.}
<A>__{matt, holding on to the metal, spins with it. he detaches shariff's tether from the panel and attaches it to himself. he lets the panel go and immediately ignites his thruster, pulling the two tethers behind him which, as they tense, bring ryan and shariff closer together.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{grab him!}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i'm trying. i'm trying.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{quick. you're pulling me away.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i got him. i got him.}
<A>__{matt tries to ignite a very long thrust in the direction of the shuttle, but this is difficult as the momentum of the other two bodies pulls him in all directions.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{clutch him like he's your valentine. i can't gauge my thrust with you two yo yoing around.}
<A>__{tentatively ryan extends her right hand to grab onto shariff's body harness. and she sees shariff's broken helmet. a hole the size of a soft ball pierces through it and has left a tunnel of frozen dried bloody mess. ryan's face is inscrutable. finally she looks away, but this time something arrests her gaze: a laminated photograph floats next to shariff, tethered to his suit via a small chain. in it, a young boy laughs with abandon, happy in the embrace of a man unseen save for his two strong arms. transfixed, ryan is unable to look away, something complicated confusing her eyes. the photograph floats in the empty space above planet earth.}
<B>__{outer space.}
<A>__{as they approach, the damage to the shuttle becomes apparent. explorer has been badly hit.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{jesus...}
<A>__{the shuttle has suffered devastating damage. the tail is beyond repair, one wing is completely destroyed, while the other waffles weakly, nearly sheared from the fuselage.}
<C>__{matt }
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{here's hoping you've got one monster insurance policy, houston. damages to explorer are... it's totaled. will commence search for survivors.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{02 down to five percent.}
<A>__{matt thrusts to slow down his trajectory and slowly bumps against the windshield of the cockpit. at the mercy of matt's momentum, ryan hits hard against the nose of the shuttle, losing her grip on shariff. as she caroms off, she grabs onto what is left of the cockpit's window.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{all right, here we go. careful of the edges.}
<A>__{matt takes his flashlight and looks through the broken windows, lighting the cockpit. ryan pulls herself up and looks through the window the cabin has been destroyed. a disarray of objects, smashed and devastated. at the end of the cabin, among the floating objects, a lifeless body drifts among the wreckage. ryan regards it silently, mesmerized.}
<B>__{bang.}
<A>__{the face of a second astronaut appears right in front of ryan and crashes against her visor. the eyes are frozen, unblinking. ryan gasps, wheeling backward and away. matt clicks shariff's harness onto the shuttle.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{houston, in the blind. to confirm. mission specialist dr. stone and myself, mission commander matthew kowalsky, are the sole survivors of sts 157.}
<A>__{matt turns to ryan, who is staring at the dead astronauts inside.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i apologize for not complying. i should've stopped working as soon as you instructed me to.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we were going to be hit no matter what. there was nothing you could've done to change that.}
<A>__{he begins to reach out, hesitates briefly, then lightly touches her shoulder.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{she turns, no elbows this time.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{alright... we have to get ourselves to the space station. there.}

<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{agreed.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{alright. after you.}
<A>__{he gently pushes her into space. she slowly drifts away from the explorer but is suddenly stopped by the safety tether. matt ignites his propellers and, giving a couple of small thrusts, he combats ryan's swing. and with a longer thrust he shoots forward, pulling ryan behind him. the two astronauts push forward together, leaving behind the shell of the shuttle and the remains of the hubble.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{houston in the blind, this is kowalsky. dr. stone and i have determined to proceed to iss and use one of their soyuz for re entry. iss if copy, please send rescue mission. repeat please dispatch rescue mission.}

<D>__{the sunrise. that's what i'm going to miss the most.}
<A>__{but ryan is not into the view right now. she's stricken with fear. her jaw is clenched and her eyes are almost closed. matt looks at the dark emptiness that engulfs him and smiles.}

<C>__{matt }
<D>__{is there a mr. stone?}
<A>__{she frowns, unable to comprehend this initially, as if it were a particularly complicated bit of math, then shakes her head.}

<A>__{matt gives ryan a gentle push, waiting until the tether goes taut, and he gives a small thrust to position himself in the right direction. he holds this single thrust for longer than all of the previous ones, immediately gaining speed, descending towards the space station which is half a mile away, and now all of its modules are clearly visible. it also becomes clear that }
<B>__{it was hit by the debris.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{houston in the blind we have visual of the iss. station must have been evacuated because first soyuz is missing. second soyuz exhibits surface damage and chute has deployed. it's use as escape pod for re entry to earth is impossible.}
<A>__{the surface of a module is badly scratched and some solar panels have been ripped. the second soyuz becomes visible, attached to the station's docking module. a piece of red and white fabric floats around the spherical capsule. ryan's losing her breath.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{shouldn't we be turning? we're drifting again }
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{sip, ryan. sip. drifting is good. we want to drift. i wasn't kidding about those fumes. this can has one or two good thrusts left. if we're lucky....}
<A>__{they approach the space station, which is just ahead of them and a hundred meters below. she's sweating and starts to hyperventilate.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{steady...}
<A>__{she looks down, eyes the station passing beneath them.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{ready... aim...}
<A>__{it looks as though the station is going to slip away altogether.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{...fire.}
<A>__{matt triggers his thruster, turning sharply. ryan's trajectory carries her in a straight line, until the tether tenses, breaking matt's direction. he fires again to counter her momentum. a very long thrust sends both of them in the right direction, straight down toward the station, but at great speed. the station is getting very close, and they're going very fast. matt ignites the frontal thruster, which begins to slow him down, but the thrust stops. ryan, following her own momentum, begins to pass matt.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{break... you have to break.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i can't. can's empty. we're coming in fast and we're going to hit hard. grab onto anything you can and hold tight!}
<A>__{just then ryan crashes against the solar panel, but is unable to grab hold. as she tumbles past, the body of the station looms. matt misses the solar panels, and collides against the station. as he begins to drift past, he reaches out and snares a railing. ryan passes flying above him. the tether tenses, pulling matt. the momentum is to great and he lets go of the railing. ryan floats over the roof of the space station, trying to grab hold of the handles and rods that stick out of the modules, but she's floating too high. she's quickly reaching the end of the station, there is only one handle left ahead, her last chance before floating away into the black void. she extends her arm and grabs the handle tightly for dear life}
<D>__{and }
<B>__{she stops.}
<A>__{she's holding onto the handle.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i got it. i got it.}
<A>__{inside the helmet she looks up and sees matt is floating straight toward her and he collides against her. for a moment they are face to face, only the glass of their headgear separates their faces. but she loses her grip on the handle and the impact projects her into the emptiness. her drifting is intercepted by a solar panel. she crashes against it, shattering it, as matt rolls above it. ryan bounces down towards the earth, tensing the tether, pulling matt, making him descend over the other side of the panel. the sharp edges of the broken panels cut the tether in two.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{the tether broke. i'm detached. i'm i'm detached.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{grab a hold. grab anything.}
<A>__{ryan is drifting away from the station. she sees the infinite black void ahead of her and }
<B>__{her foot gets stuck in the parachute.}
<A>__{it becomes tangled in the strings and fabric, slowing her down. ryan is panting, her face covered in sweat. she turns back and}
<D>__{sees }
<A>__{matt rolling, drifting in her direction. she stretches out her arm. matt's arm is also outstretched.}
<C>__{matt }
<P>__{(an edge)}
<D>__{give me... give me five here, ryan.}
<A>__{he's trying to make light of it, but he's really struggling to reach her. ryan stretches farther. matt's hand comes closer to hers. the tips of their fingers are almost touching.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i've got you. i've got you }
<A>__{the very tips of their fingers touch }
<B>__{but they miss.}
<A>__{as matt drifts past.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{shit... shit...}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{no. no. no. don't you. no. don't you. don't. don't. no}
<A>__{as the parachute tenses, she stops. the tether attached to matt's suit passes two feet away from her}
<D>__{and }
<A>__{ryan grabs the tether. it slides through her closed fist, until her grip tightens and the tether stops.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{gotcha!}
<A>__{matt's momentum is now pulling ryan, dragging her loose from the parachute.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you have to let me go.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{what? no }
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you have to.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{those ropes are too loose, i'm pulling you with me. you have to let me go or we both die }
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i'm not letting you go! we're fine.}
<A>__{her leg slides through the loose rope and she floats further out, being snagged at the last minute by a tether around her foot. (we move from high angle to low angle two shot). as this}
