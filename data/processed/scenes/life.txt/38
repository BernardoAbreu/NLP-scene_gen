<L>__{interior mess hall dusk}
<A>__{wincing with each movement and covered in grime from the day's labors, the new men bring up the back of the chow line. cookie, the grub slinger, slaps a large dollop of an unidentifiable substance onto ray's tray.}

<C>__{cookie}
<D>__{those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.}
<A>__{another prisoner lays down some tobacco and gets a juicy steak. ray grabs a hunk of corn bread and makes his way to the back of the room. claude steps up, holds out his tray for cookie.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{excuse me, i don't like it when the food touches each other, so if you could just }
<P>__{(splat!)}
<D>__{ keep everything separate.}
<A>__{disappointed, claude turns to discover that the only seat left is next to ray. scowling, he limps toward it. jangle leg's eyes follow claude as he approaches the table. biscuit smacks him.}
<C>__{biscuit}
<D>__{eyes front, mister!}
<A>__{claude sits down and promptly goes to work scraping his burnt toast with his knife. the irritating sound slowly brings the entire room to dead silence. all eyes fall on claude. scratch, scratch, scratch...}

<D>__{problem with the toast?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{it's fine now.}
<A>__{cookie glowers and takes a seat.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{stop aggravating people. just eat your food.}
<A>__{as the room returns to normal, claude starts polishing his fork with his shirttail. irritated, ray shoots him a look.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{this fork is filthy.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{the fork is the least of your worries, claude.}
<A>__{undeterred, claude breathes on his fork and polishes it some more. disgusted, ray pushes aside his plate.}

<D>__{what did you guys do?}
<A>__{the whole table waits expectantly for their reply.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. must have been 15 or twenty not counting women and children. it was a real bloodbath. all that screaming...}
<C>__{claude}

<D>__{he just blocked it out. nigger's crazy. he's the one who did all the stabbing. he's capable of some heinous shit.}
<P>__{(thumbing down the table)}
<D>__{how 'bout him down there?}
<A>__{at the end of the table, goldmouth, a hulking specimen, snarls menacingly, flashing a glittering set of teeth.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{goldmouth? they say he was born out back behind the shithouse. that's what they say.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you all been here a long time. doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?}

<D>__{greenville, that the nearest town?}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{it's a two day walk if you don't get lost. take a mighty cagey country boy to navigate the woods and bayous between here and there.}
<C>__{biscuit}
<D>__{those dogs they got can sniff a skid mark in your underpants from a half mile off.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{alright, well, let's say you make it to greenville. what's there, anyway?}

<D>__{didn't even get to have my peach cobbler.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{the most important thing they got in greenville is a train that heads up north.}
<A>__{just then, goldmouth stands up, casting a shadow over claude.}
<C>__{goldmouth}
<D>__{hey, girl, you gonna eat your corn bread?}
<A>__{claude looks up, considering his options.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{no, man. i want you to have it.}

<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i thought my mama made good corn bread but this is really something special.}
<A>__{ray looks at the faces around the room, smiles broadly. goldmouth is getting embarrassed.}
<C>__{ray}

<A>__{the prisoners begin to laugh. ray's got them now.}
