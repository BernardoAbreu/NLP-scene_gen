<A>__{as viking bob walks back to his station wagon, he notices kenai poking around in front of wilder's cabin. viking bob's pov illuminated by a bare bulb is wilder's typical bush country front yard. piled are five cords of wood, boxes, tarps, stove parts, saw horses, 55 gallon drums, dismantled snow machines, wash tubs, tires, etc. bunching his collar around his neck, kenai shivers and sorts through corbett's traps.}
