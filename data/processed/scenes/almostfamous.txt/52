<L>__{exterior teacher's lounge day}
<A>__{william knocks on the teacher's lounge door. a teacher answers, protective of their sanctuary.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(urgently)}
<D>__{i need to talk to mrs. deegan, from journalism.}
<A>__{mrs. deegan appears in the doorway.}
<L>__{exterior william's home late afternoon}
<A>__{the sun is still shining. it's late afternoon, as elaine miller exits her car and arrives home. she sees a few extra cars in the driveway, is immediately suspicious.}
<L>__{interior living room late afternoon}
<A>__{elaine arrives to find william, mrs. deegan and darryl awaiting her in the living room. it's a 1973 style intervention. they wear sunny, compassionate smiles.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{whatever it is, the answer is no.}
<C>__{mrs. deegan}
<D>__{elaine, we need to talk to you. nothing is wrong.}
<A>__{i am a teacher.}
<D>__{you're a teacher. we speak the same language.}
<A>__{mom sits down. she is fully engaged and worried, her natural state.}
<C>__{mrs. deegan }
<D>__{now i'm not a jump up and down person, but something wondrous has happened to william. and you have every reason to be happy...}
<P>__{(knows her)}
<D>__{... and calm.}
<A>__{carefully gauging elaine's face, the teacher continues.}
<C>__{mrs. deegan }
<D>__{william has been gifted with a shining opportunity in the world of journalism. through a love of music, and at an oddly young age, he has received a major assignment from a national publication called rolling stone magazine.}
<A>__{mrs. deegan produces a copy, and places it on elaine's lap. it sits there like the plague.}
<C>__{mrs. deegan }
<D>__{now you are rather famously not a fan of rock music, but such are the ironies of life, that happens to be the very topic of william's assignment }
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{ rock music. a band.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(warily, to darryl)}
<D>__{honey, what are you doing here?}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{moral support.}
<A>__{mom looks evenly at her son, seated opposite her in this small living room.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{what's involved?}
<C>__{mrs. deegan}
<D>__{well. it's a great opportunity. he'll be well paid, and published nationally }
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{ and he'll go on tour with a rock band for four days. no small planes... he travels on a bus.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{is it time for me to say something?}
<C>__{mrs. deegan}
<D>__{sure. elaine no.}
<C>__{mrs. deegan}
<D>__{and in anticipation of that response }
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mrs. deegan}
<D>__{ william has prepared }
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(rueful)}
<D>__{"lo, that which i have feared has come upon me."}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(lightening fast)}
<D>__{"he who jealously guards his fears, quietly yearns to bring them about!"}
<A>__{mrs. deegan admires their high strung intellectual parrying, makes an impressed noise.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(with compassion) no.}
<A>__{i have raised him to be an honor}
<D>__{student, which he is. we have agreed on all our goals. we raised him to be a lawyer, we moved here to be near the finest law school in the west. plus, he has finals coming up, and in one week he graduates with all his friends }
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{he's got no friends!!}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{darryl. please.}
<A>__{nearby, having anticipated all of the above, william nods to mrs. deegan, and stands.}
<C>__{mrs. deegan}
<D>__{elaine, may i present to you... your own son.}
<A>__{william takes a lawyerly stroll, turns to face his mom.}
<D>__{william lady of the jury.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i wish to disprove the prevailing false belief that rock music is based on drugs and sex. true, perhaps at one time... but rock music is different now. it is now performed by hard working intellectuals, with... with blazing intellectual pursuits, and i am going to play for you a piece of music designed to show you that my thesis is correct.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{this is going to be hell.}
<A>__{across the room, darryl takes his position near the stereo.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{the song is based on the literature of tolkien... and it's mystical attempt to elevate humanity has been successful throughout the world... this song will change your life.}
<A>__{mom stifles a cough. william nods to darryl, who reverentially drops the needle with a thud. mom is trapped, as we listen to silent static... and then... the opening notes of led zeppelin's "stairway to heaven." william gives his mother the album cover's inner sleeve with lyrics.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{we ask you only to listen.}
<A>__{camera passes across their serious and expectant faces. the intro in not short. we listen, just watching their faces, as elaine becomes increasingly impatient.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{when is it going to start }
<C>__{william}
<D>__{soon.}
<A>__{immediately, overlapping, the vocal begins. ("there's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold.")}
