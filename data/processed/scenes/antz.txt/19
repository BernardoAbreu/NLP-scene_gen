<D>__{the army's returned! our brave boys}
<P>__{are back! (etc.)}
<A>__{everyone waves little flags as the tuba player oompah oompah oompahs... ...and z walks into the hall, looking bedraggled and exhausted, his helmet hanging over his ears. the band slows to a halt. at the edge of the crowd, azteca, sitting on weaver's shoulders, can just about see over the crowd.}
