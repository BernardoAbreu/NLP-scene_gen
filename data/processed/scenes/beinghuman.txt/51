<L>__{1400 years.}
<A>__{hector sits in the wagon beside a woman. there are tantalizing similarities between their situation and the one we left thalia and hector in on the boat a few moments ago, 1400 years ago. the woman and hector exchange glances now and then, delicate signals of mutual awareness. talking without words. they are not alone in the wagon, perched on its half load of timber. with them is a nun accompanying a girl of about eight. the girl is tearful. a man, his face unseen, is snoring underneath his hat. a younger man, gaunt and hungry looking, is dressed in the rough travelling clothes of a monk or priest. even without his habit we would know he was a holy man. his incessant talk tells us.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{we want to praise god because we live in this ultimate age, when all things are done, all is known, all the wonders of his creation revealed to us... nothing more for man to see or do... all that is left is the hope of salvation... even for our humbler sisters...}
<A>__{the girl is sobbing through all of this.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{yes weep, child, weep for joy... you are a glorious example to us all... already a child of god's... blessed to spend your earthly days within his church as christ's servant... what generous parents you have... giving you to the sisters... what a sacrifice.}
<A>__{there is an irish lilt to his voice which colors what he is saying with a tinge of mischief. he is a difficult fellow to pin down. hector looks at him amusedly, still sharing his thoughts silently with the woman, beatrice. the nun interrupts the priest cheerfully.}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{she's already received the last rites, before she left her family. she belongs to god now... don't you?}
<A>__{the child sobs more noisily.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{fortunate child, destined for paradise. untouched by the abiding curse of carnal lust. i struggle against it...}
<C>__{priest }
<D>__{i will not join myself carnally with any woman...}
<A>__{he looks accusingly at beatrice.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{... i will carry my unspilt seed from this world to the nexterior.. as should every man...}
<A>__{now hector is getting the hard looks from the priest.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{... if all men forsook forever the fleshy temptations... and held womankind to barrenness... think how much the sooner would come the day of judgement... all god's chosen gathered in paradise... i've written a small treatise in favor of virginity, sister. we could discuss it later if you like...}
<A>__{the driver of the wagon turns his head briefly to the priest.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{hector gestures to beatrice that he is leaving the wagon to walk for a while and asks her to join him. she shakes her head with a smile. hector smiles, too, then jumps down from the wagon and, walking slowly, allows it to gain ground in front of him. the ramblings of the priest fade away.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{it's simple, brother... if we cease carnal union entirely then in fifty or so years we'll all be rid of our earthly lives and god can proceed with his reign over his heavenly kingdom... that same paradise that god gave to man before, but which man was so unfit to inhabit that within seven hours eve was already tempting her master and mate, and within nine hours the lord had to expel the both of them! just think, they messed it up in nine hours!}
