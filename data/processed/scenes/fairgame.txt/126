<A>__{to night three months later in the full force of an air raid. many of the same buildings are gone. the whole world shakes and trembles as a paveway ge101 laser guided bomb streaks in and impacts.. dust. shrapnel. cars on fire. a vision of utter hell. a figure darts between burning cars, clutching a bag of food, amid the firestorm. he disappears into our building. our eye leaves the street back inside: sa'ad bursts in as another missile lands nearby. the building shakes. the picture of sawsan shifts. dust falls like fine rain over the small kitchen. sa'ad unpacks food on the rickety table. under it, his wife, children cower. he passes down bread. cheese. the baby is crying. there is a knock at the door. on the other side are two men.}
