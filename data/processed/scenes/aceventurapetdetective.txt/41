<A>__{ace climbs a ladder on the side of the tank, singing more intensely now. the ladder leads to a narrow catwalk over the center of the water. ace grabs a feeder fish from a pail and walks carefully out there.}

<D>__{snowflake… here, snowflake… snooowflaaaake…}
<B>__{a great white lunges out of the water and snaps its jaws an inch}
