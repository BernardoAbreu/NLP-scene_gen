<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{all we can see, filling the entire frame is a flame orange sky...almost like the sky from the burning of atlanta in "gone with the wind". superimpose: presenter credit. pan down lower and lower until we see the terrain below... the desert. there is no vegetation whatever, just sand and odd shaped rock formations. the air is filled with red dust, which alternately obscures and then reveals the image. camera moves forward optically enlarging the film grain in the process.}
<B>__{slow disolve opening credits begin.}
<A>__{another shot of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre rocks. dust. sound of wind. camera moves forward again.}
<B>__{dissolve.}
<A>__{another landscape, but this time, in the distance are some enormous plastic domes. sunlight striking them and reflect ing causes brilliant rainbows. camera optically tracks toward the dome, seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion through the red dust. dissolve... another angle, and, in the distance, on the horizon of the arid landscape is a huge sphinx like structure. (it is reminiscent of the egyptian sphinx, but both body and face, though gargoyle like, are different in design.) there are some large pyramids not far from the sphinx. camera moves optically forward. dissolve. camera is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front. it moves (combination of zoom and optical printer move) towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems. as camera approaches one of the eyes, it appears to be stained red glass, as in a temple. suddenly there is a terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of fragments which hurtle toward the camera...}
<L>__{interior catacomb below "sphinx" day}
<A>__{a man wearing a lightweight thermal suit is running through this labyrinth of tunnels. the ground trembles under him, as if in an earthquake. we cannot clearly make out his face, especially since he wears some kind of breathing apparatus over a portion of it. the surface of the tunnel's "walls" is curious; the walls are, again, bright reddish orange, and a composite of two different substances: rough textured, clay like material and red quartz, which glistens like crystal. the man throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fear fully, as he runs. his hands are splattered with blood. because of this, the red glow, the air of fear to the man, and the ground heaving and buckling, there is almost a satanic suggestion to the scene. suddenly, up ahead of the man, there appears a brilliant white light. he sees it, and runs even faster towards it. we are almost up to the light, and we see hands reaching out of the light towards us... that seem to beckon him to}
<B>__{safety.}
<A>__{abruptly, the entire screen goes red, but in reverse negative; with yellow layovers. (so that all the images we see entire frame are small yellow areas diffused on a red background.) it is much like looking at a tableau made out of molten lava.}

<L>__{interior bedroom in small apartment morning}
<A>__{douglas quail and his wife kristen, are asleep in bed. gradually the room lights brighten. the clock chimes and begins speaking in a soft, feminine voice.}
<C>__{clock}
<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{tick, tock, seven o'clock. time to rise and open your eyes.}
<A>__{they don't budge. shortly, the clock chimes again.}
<C>__{clock}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{tick, tock, seven oh one. time to get up, the day had begun.}
<A>__{quail's wife stirs. maddeningly, the clock chimes a third time.}
<C>__{clock}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{tick, tock }
<A>__{quail reaches out and shuts the clock off. then he sits up in bed. he swings his legs out from under the covers and sits on the edge of the bed. he puts on his glasses and sits, lost in thought. he is a good looking but conventional man in his early thirties. he seems rather in awe of his wife, who is attractive and rather off hand towards him. kirsten pulls on her robe, lights a cigarette, sits fishing for her slippers.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{i dreamed about mars again... it was bizarre, yet is was so real...}
<C>__{kirsten}
<P>__{(casual)}
<D>__{it's your time of the month again.}
<A>__{quail looks at her quizzically.}
<C>__{kirsten}
<P>__{(continuing; world weary air)}
<D>__{at least once a month. douglas quail's obsession. for twelve years you've been talking about mars.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{people do go to mars, you know.}
<C>__{kirsten}
<D>__{that's right, douglas. but not you. not us.}
<A>__{quail looks crestfallen.}
<C>__{kirsten}
<P>__{(continuing; disdainful)}
<D>__{as it is, we can barely scrape by on your lousy ten thousand a week.}
<A>__{she leaves the room. he meditates on what she said, depressed.}
<L>__{interior kitchenette morning}
<A>__{quail and kirsten sit at a small table, eating breakfast. on the wall is projected the front page of a newspaper. drinking his coffee, quail studies the wall with the air of a man who had his "node stuck in a newspaper," ignoring his wife. the newspaper headline reads: "rioting on mars over water tax." his wife is reading a different article: "four women rape man in park."}
<C>__{kirsten}
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{what do they expect ... the way men dress these days ... then they scream rape.}
<A>__{quail is absorbed in his own paper and doesn't hear her.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{you know let's really do it.}
<C>__{kirsten}
<D>__{rape men in the park?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{no. go to mars.}
<C>__{kirsten}
<P>__{(withering)}
<D>__{go to hell.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{we can pool our savings and i've got some sick leave coming, besides my regular vacation...}
<C>__{kirsten}
<P>__{(interrupting; corrects herself)}
<D>__{...more of a half wit. for a start a war could break out there any day ...}
<A>__{she gestures toward the tv screen where martian police are keeping protesters behind a barrier. some have signs reading "a free mars", "down with cohaagen", "earth out" etc.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{that's just media talk. they're...}
<P>__{(indicating the protesters)}
<D>__{...just a minority. they're powerless.}
<C>__{kirsten}
<D>__{well, there's a lot of things we need around here before we waste our money on a trip to mars. we're broke. i'm just a slave around this dump. now if you were capable of finding a better job....}
<A>__{the kitchen clock chimes and talks.}
<C>__{clock}
<D>__{it's now eight. you'll be late!}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{i will be late!}
<A>__{he jumps up quickly from the table, picks up his coat and briefcase, kisses kirsten's perfunctorily offered cheek and leaves.}
<L>__{exterior city early morning}
<A>__{camera tracks with quail as he walks along the busy modern street towards a subway station. modern cars (out of focus) pass noiselessly between the camera and quail. there is a plaintive tune being played on violin. quail pauses and gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist, then walks on briskly.}
<L>__{interior subway station early morning}
<A>__{quail enters the station. everybody must pass through a weapons check before proceeding to the platforms. two armed guards stand at either side, as commuters pass through an electronic beam. on a screen, the entire body of each person is seen in x ray. all of them are clearly carrying a gun in their inside coat pocket.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{no weapon again, mr. quail?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{i keep forgetting, herb. they frighten me.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{yeah? well, it's the law, mr. quail. has been since 1990 they tell me. tomorrow ya carry ya gun or ya get reported.}
<A>__{guard gestures to his associate. they've obviously been through this with quail before.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{okay. herb, okay.}
<A>__{quail walks on to the track area. the train arrives. signs above each approaching car say "car full", "room for 10 persons", etc. quail goes to a carriage marked "new car".}
<L>__{interior urban transit train day}
<A>__{the doors open and the crowd surges on. quail grabs a seat. at intervals throughout the car are video monitors on which a news broadcast is showing.}
<C>__{newscaster }
<D>__{ more violence today from mars's strike torn ore colonies }
<A>__{everyone ignores the broadcast except quail, who perks instantly at the word "mars." the newscaster is a young black man.}
<C>__{newscaster}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...but earth intelligence operations director vilos cohaagen, clearly worried about the damage to mars's all important tourist industry was today dismissive of the dissident groups....}
<A>__{tv scene switches to a press conference. cohaagen, sur rounded by aides, steps in front of a podium packed with news network microphones and cameras. cohaagen is a striking, intense man with an obvious air of power.}
<C>__{cohaagen}
<D>__{we're dealing with a bunch of extremists and unrepresentative lunatics. mars is a happy and prosperous protectorate of earth... and will remain so.}
<A>__{the train stops at another station and more people pile on. quail tries to watch the broadcast through the bodies passing in front of him and intermittently blocking the image.}
<C>__{reporter }
<D>__{there have been some criticisms, sir....}
<C>__{cohaagen}
<D>__{i have no further comment.}
<A>__{the news conference ends and a bright looking young man comes on the screen. quail continues to watch, though not as interested, initially, as he was by the mars story. few of the other passengers bother looking at the screen.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{good morning, commuters. this portion of your trip is brought to you by rekall, inc. do you have a dream that never came true? do you aspire but only perspire? has the great adventure passed you by? then come to... rekall, where what might have been will have been. for the memories of a lifetime... rekall.}
<A>__{quail watches the commercial through to the end, but doesn't seem to take it very seriously. he glances away as a card comes on the screen with rekall's numbers.}
<L>__{interior quail's office day}
<A>__{quail is seated at a computer console in a vast beehive of a room. numerous people are typing information onto the screens. quail pauses in his typing, thoughtful. he then types in a little more information, then pauses again. on the screen, a sentence types itself... why have you stopped? request more information. quail read it and continues.}
<L>__{interior mcclane's office rekall day}
<A>__{scene opens on a cu of mcclane, a genial, bubbling, enthus iastic man.}
<D>__{mcclane we're all dreamers, douglas. but here at rekall, dreams are our business.}
<A>__{he presses a button on his desk and the chairs on which they are seated appear to be in outer space. countless stars glitter all around. startlingly, a comet whizzes by. quail is amazed. mcclane grins and presses the button again. the scene changes to a beautiful underwater coral reef. multi colored fish swim around the chairs and desk.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{but... is the process really that effective? a false memory!? mcclane}
<P>__{(shaking his head; smiling)}
<D>__{we prefer the term "extra factual implant". your memory will be complete in every way. you will have gone to mars. we guarantee that.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{is it in any way dangerous? i mean, the medical techniques? mcclane not when you deal with qualified operators like us.}
<A>__{he presses the button again and the normal office returns. quail looks around, impressed.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{it's just incredible. mcclane and look at our follow up program!}
<A>__{he puts items on the desk as he talks.}
<D>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{space flight ticket stub... passport... vaccination certificates... matchbooks from martian nouvelle cuisine restaurants, souvenirs, post cards... even names of people you met now back there who you can call and discuss your trip with... by the way, we plant these things where you'll come across them at random in the future.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{but... i will know i hired you. that'll destroy the whole illusion. mcclane}
<P>__{(smiling; self satisfied)}
<D>__{but you won't remember me, or having been here.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{i won't? mcclane your money back if you do! we've never paid out yet.}
<A>__{quail slumps backs in his chair, overwhelmed.}
<D>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and we have a special this month, for only two hundred thousand dollars more.}
<A>__{at the press of a button, a list appears on the wall... a14 millionaire playboy a15 sports hero a16 industrial tycoon a17 intelligence agent}
<D>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you can have a new identity for the duration of the trip. pick one.}
<A>__{quail's eyes linger on "intelligence agent."}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{"intelligence agent"... wouldn't that be dangerous? i might attack.... mcclane}
<P>__{(airily)}
<D>__{no. no. you're a retired agent. mars was your last mission and you're never to break your cover. but you'll have got the girl, killed the baddies, and saved the universe. not bad, eh?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{i don't know... about the whole thing... it's all such a fake. i won't really have gone. i won't really.... mcclane}
<P>__{(kind but firm)}
<D>__{let's face it, douglas, you, and millions of people like you have no chance of ever getting to mars and you'd never qualify as a secret agent for eio. this rekall is the only way to achieve your dream.}
<A>__{he gets up and walks around to quail's chair.}
<D>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{think about it, douglas. think, too, what a terrible boor a real holiday is. lost tickets, endless arguments, lousy hotels, missed connections, rotten weather... rekall will supply you with perfect, happy memories.}
<A>__{quail is thoughtful, willing to be totally convinced.}
<L>__{interior quail's apartment night}
<A>__{quail is sitting, distracted, in an uncomfortable modern chair. kirsten is watching a near pornographic film on tv. she casually lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{you know that's illegal.}
<C>__{kirsten}
<D>__{yeah? who's going to report me? you?... wimp....}
<A>__{she watches a torrid love scene on the video.}
<C>__{kirsten}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{screwing around's illegal, too. but just give me half a chance...}
<A>__{quail looks at her with distaste. his expression changes to one of resolve.}
<L>__{interior memory studio day}
<A>__{quail is stretched out on a plush reclining couch, alongside some strange looking lab equipment, wearing a hospital type smock. in the b.g. hovers a technician, adjusting some instrumentation (discreet banks of computers, etc.) that apparently relates to the lab equipment next to quail. the room in a dim, soothing booth, lit by indirect lighting. quail looks a little concerned as he studies all the instrumentation next to him as one always does at the dentist's, looking at the drills. the door opens abruptly, in walks a cute looking little old lady, wearing a jogging suit. (a ruth gordon type.)}
<C>__{old lady}
<D>__{hi, i'm doctor sophie lull. sorry i'm late.}
<P>__{(walks toward coat closet)}
<D>__{i will be right with you.}
<A>__{she dons a white medical smock that covers her jogging suit, then slings on heavy, lead lined protective vest.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(looking at}
<D>__{instrument}
<P>__{console)}
<D>__{this really going to work?}
<C>__{lull}
<D>__{it the pope martian?}
<A>__{lull's assistant, the technician in b.g., who had been steadily working on the instrumentation, now looks over at lull.}
<C>__{ernie }
<P>__{(at machine)}
<D>__{okay that's it.}
<A>__{now, lull extends a long rubber tube, a hypodermic needle attached to it. quail eyes it warily. she swabs the back of his hand in preparation, notices his apprehension.}
<C>__{lull}
<D>__{now, just relax, kid. this ain't gonna hurt. just a controlled drip of narkadine. when you're under, i will just ask ya a few questions, nothin' real personal, just full details of yer private life so's we can tailor the wish fulfillment program to your needs.}
<A>__{she injects the needle into his hand as she speaks, tapes it down.}
<C>__{lull}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{see? painless. i didn't feel a thing. hey, you're a nice kid... you like a little somethin' extra?}
<A>__{quail, embarrassed, starting to go under, nods.}
<C>__{lull}
<P>__{(continuing; pleased)}
<D>__{good! kid have i got a girl for you! she's gonna like you. you're good lookin'.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{gettin' sleepy?}
<P>__{(he nods)}
<D>__{good. now, what's the first thing you think of when you're thinkin' about mars?}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(wistfully)}
<D>__{well... i'd like to see the martian sphinx...}
<C>__{lull}
<D>__{okay you will, dougle! i want ya to start counting backwards from a hundred for me.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(sleepily)}
<D>__{one hundred... ninety nine... ninety eight... ninety seven... ninety six... ninety five....}
<A>__{his voice drops off; his eyes close. lull studies him, adjusts some instruments, then turns to ernie, glancing briefly at a typed sheet in front of her.}
<C>__{lull}
<D>__{okay, ernie, the trip to mars; number sixty two... and throw in that blonde... we'll give him a real good time.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{sixty two... and... the blonde...}
<A>__{he takes two discs and inserts the first one into a machine.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{boy, is this one wild. he won't want to come back.}
<A>__{ernie inserts the second disk.}
<C>__{lull}
<D>__{dougie? this sophie lull. can ya hear me?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{...sophie....}
<C>__{lull}
<D>__{good! ... i'm gonna ask ya a few more questions now. ya think you'll be able to answer 'em?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{...yes....}
<C>__{lull}
<D>__{attaboy! to begin with, i wanna ask ya; you sex life. how many orgasms a week?}
<L>__{interior mcclane's office day}
<A>__{mcclane has several file drawers open and is removing diverse objects and placing them on his desk. these items apparently are objects rekall, inc. intends to "plant" for some client of theirs to find (perhaps even quail) as part of his fantasy. while he is putting these things on his desk, the phone buzzes. he answers it.}
<D>__{mcclane yes?}
<C>__{lull }
<P>__{(filtered; tense)}
<D>__{howie? listen, you'd better get in here. mcclane}
<P>__{(not too concerned)}
<D>__{not another schizoid embolism.}
<C>__{lull }
<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{you'd better get in here.}
<L>__{interior memory studio day}
<A>__{mcclane come quickly in, brushing the swinging door open. lull and ernie look up as he enters. quail lies on the couch, breathing slowly and regularly, his eyes closed. mcclane looks queryingly at lull, who motions him to silence.}
<C>__{lull}
<P>__{(bends over quail)}
<D>__{quail? dougie, can you hear me?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{lull}
<D>__{tell mcclane what you told us.}
<A>__{mcclane glances sharply at lull, then turns to quail. quail's eyes open and scan the room. they settle on mcclane. these eyes have changed: they have become cold and steely. in fact, quail's entire personality seems to have changed his face has acquired a flint edged hardness. he is chillingly menacing.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(a deadly voice)}
<D>__{all of you in this room are dead. mcclane}
<P>__{(not quite}
<D>__{taking it}
<P>__{seriously)}
<D>__{what's he talking about?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{you've broken my cover. mcclane what is this?...}
<A>__{mcclane's eyes flash angrily at lull.}
<C>__{lull}
<D>__{the narkadine cracked a memory cap. mars }
<P>__{(she's scared)}
<D>__{he's really been there.}
<A>__{there is a chilly silence in the room as mcclane digests this.}
<D>__{mcclane forced suppression?}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{with spontaneous breakthrough. mcclane holy shit.}
<A>__{they stare at quail as if he's a ticking bomb.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{you've compromised the sphinx project. you'll have to be silenced.}

<D>__{i believe you, but that won't stop e.t.o. from killing you.}

<A>__{his voice trails off, his eyes close.}
<C>__{lull}
<P>__{(intensely)}
<D>__{he wants a false memory implanted of a trip he really took.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{someone at earth intelligence operations erased his memory. all he know was going to mars meant something special to him.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{what do we do? graft a false memory pattern over the real memory of the same thing?}
<C>__{lull}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{uh uh... that could promote a partial breakthrough of the real trip. mcclane}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{revive him without any false memory implantation and get him out of here.}
<C>__{lull}
<D>__{why don't we just wipe out the memory of his visit here? mcclane}
<P>__{(nodding; relieved)}
<D>__{yes. good. i will destroy his file and cancel his fee. i have a feeling that the longer he doesn't know who he is, where he's been, where he's going and who we are, the better off we'll all be. i'm taking a holiday. a real one.}
<A>__{he leaves. the others stare after him, looking very grim.}
<L>__{interior reception area of rekall day}
<A>__{a dazed and disoriented douglas quail comes out of an inner door and walks through the lobby towards the exit door. an attractive receptionist, her bare breasts visible through a clear plastic blouse, watches him; she then looks toward mcclane who has half opened the door to view quail's progress.}

<D>__{travelling south along third avenue, passing fourty third street.}
<A>__{although the driver's voice is a little mechanical (flat in tone) he is filmed from quail's pov, and it isn't obvious he is anything other than an ordinary cab driver.}

<D>__{thirty three thirteen "g" street, sector "l", twin towers, apartment six thirty five.}

<D>__{you stepped into it in the normal manner, sir or madam.}
<L>__{interior corridor of quail's apartment day}
<A>__{the reception area and hallway leading to the elevators is smart and clean, though not lavish. a uniformed and armed doorman is standing by the entrance door. filmed from the elevator end of the area, we see the cab pull up and quail alight and enter the building. he nods to the doorman and approaches the elevators. as he reaches them a man steps out from behind the camera. a 2nd man enters from a door opposite the elevators. quail looks at them and becomes quite panicky.}
<D>__{1st agent aren't you the man from mars?}
<A>__{he takes a modern, lethal gun from his pocket. quail turns, but the other man is behind him.}
<D>__{2nd agent don't give us a reason to kill you.}

<P>__{fragments)}
<D>__{sphinx?... no, no, i don't, i... what about the people at rekall? i don't recall rekall but you said if they know what i did? why don't you ask them? they'll tell you i didn't... 1st agent they've been taken care of.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<A>__{neither man bothers answering. they arrive at their car and open the door for quail. he hesitates.}

<D>__{what are you going to do with me? 1st agent get in the car.}
<A>__{he slaps quail hard across the face. quail is terrified. he is tearful with fear.}

<D>__{my god! no! you're going to kill me!}
<A>__{he cringes. his hands across his face.}
<D>__{1st agent no one's going to kill you if [you do what you're told.] we're visiting e.i.o. for some new tests. now get in, or do we start playing rough?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{no! it's not my fault! you can't do it!}
<A>__{they start to force him into the car physically. suddenly, quail stops cringing. the fear disappears from his face, and is replaced by an odd, thoughtful expression.}
