<L>__{interior dr. drayton's office day}
<A>__{claire sits in a comfortable looking chair with her purse in her lap, arms crossed.}
<C>__{dr. drayton }
<P>__{(a smooth, mellifluous baritone)}
<D>__{who's idea was it?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{mine. his. we both...thought...}
<A>__{she trails off. camera slowly pulls back to reveal, dr. timothy drayton, a stocky, light skinned black man in his late forties with a kind face and piercing brown eyes.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i didn't want to come.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{then why did you?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{because he was worried about me.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{your husband?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{do you really think so?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{there's a pause.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{why is he worried?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{because, i don't know, because sometimes...sometimes i forget things...and ever since caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...i fainted and...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why is this so hard?}
<A>__{dr. drayton takes a little silver bowl full of shiny, red fireballs next to his chair. he proffers it to claire.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{fireball?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you're joking.}
<A>__{he shakes his head. she shrugs, then grabs one and pops it into her mouth.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{it's hard because i'm a complete stranger and what we're talking about is incredibly personal. besides, the first time most people come here, a part of them is wondering if i'm gonna think they're crazy.}
<A>__{she sucks on the fireball and slowly nods.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{don't worry, i'm required to have at least three sessions in order to commit.}
<A>__{her eyes get a little wider.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{now that's a joke.}
<A>__{she manages an unsteady smile.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{i have some training at helping people through the stressful moments in life, one of which you may or may not be experiencing. if you want to get some stuff off your chest, great. if not...}
<A>__{he smiles and shrugs, "no problem." she stares at him for a moment.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(re: fireball)}
<D>__{these are good.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{mm hmm.}
<A>__{she studies him for a moment.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{there's a ghost in my house.}
<A>__{he nods slightly, as if she's told him, "i have some anxiety." claire goes on.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{she finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. angry rock and roll.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{how do you know it's a she?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i saw her in the water. beside me. she was filling the bathtub.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{what does she look like?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{pretty. she's a blond.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{do you have any idea who she is?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{um...i'd rather not say...just yet.}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what do you think i should do?}
<A>__{he thinks for a moment, then:}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{try to contact her.}
<A>__{claire nearly swallows her fireball.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{try to communicate with her somehow.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you think that'll help?}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{can't hurt. and i think it's important you find out what she wants.}
<A>__{claire ponders this for a moment, then looks back up at him.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{are you humoring me?}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{nope.}
<A>__{she seems satisfied by his sincerity.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{dr. drayton}
<D>__{i don't know. my aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.}
<A>__{he stands. claire nods, then stands. she smiles too.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{is this time okay?}
<A>__{he nods.}
