<D>__{"raiders of the lost ark" screenplay by lawrence kasdan story by george lucas}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior peru high jungle day}
<A>__{the dense, lush rain forests of the eastern slopes of the andes, the place known as "the eyebrow of the jungle". ragged, jutting canyon walls are half hidden by the thick mists. the main title is followed by this:}
<B>__{peru}
<L>__{1936}
<A>__{a narrow trail across the green face of the canyon. a group of men make their way along it. at the head of the party is an american, indiana jones. he wears a short leather jacket, a flapped holster, and a brimmed felt hat with a weird feather stuck in the band. behind him come two spanish peruvians, satipo and barranca. bringing up the rear are five yagua indians. they act as porters and are wrangling the two heavily packed llamas. the indians become increasingly nervous. they speak to each other in bursts of quechua. the american, who is known to his friends as indy, glances back at them.}
<C>__{barranca}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{they're talking about the curse again!}
<A>__{he turns and yells at the indians in quechua, his anger giving an indication of his own fears. the party reaches a break in the canyon wall and takes the trail through it. when they emerge, their destination is revealed to them in the distance. beyond a thick stand of trees is the vegetation enshrouded temple of the chachapoyan warriors. the entire party is struck by the sight. the indians, terrified now, chatter away. suddenly the three at the back turn and run, dropping their packs as they go. barranca yells at the fleeing indians and pulls his pistol out. he starts to raise his arm to aim but indy restrains it in a muscular grip.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{barranca looks evilly at indy's hand upon him. indy releases him and smiles in a friendly way.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{we don't need them.}
<A>__{satipo watches this confrontation with some concern.}
<C>__{barranca}
<D>__{i do not carry supplies.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{we'll leave them. once we've got it, we'll be able to reach the plane by dusk.}
<A>__{he turns back to the trail. satipo gets the two remaining indians moving behind indy. satipo and barranca then have a fast, silent communication: barranca indicates his desire to slit indy's throat; satipo gives him a look that says "be patient, you idiot".}
<B>__{the approach to the temple}
<A>__{the party fans out to fight their way through the entwined trees that guard the temple. visibility is cut to five feet in the heavy mist. satipo extracts a short, native dart from a tree and examines the point gingerly}
<C>__{satipo}
<P>__{(showing indy)}
<D>__{the hovitos are near. the poison is still fresh... three days. they're following us, i tell you.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{if they knew we were here, they would have killed us already.}
<A>__{the two indiana jabber in quechua, near hysteria. barranca is sweating profusely, eyes darting. he yells at the indians in quechua to "shut up". in the undergrowth, there is slithering movement. indian #1 draws aside a branch and is faced with a horrific stone sculpture of a chachapoyan demon. the indian is so frightened no sound comes out when he screams. he turns and runs silently away. indian #2 calls to his friend. getting no response, he steps in that direction. a huge macaw, flushed from the undergrowth, screams and flies away. indian #2 does exactly the same thing, never to be seen again. indy, satipo and barranca, just clearing the trees, look back in that direction. they all turn to face the temple. it is dark and awesome. vegetation curls from every crevice, over each elaborate frieze. the entrance round, open and black has been designed to look like open jaws.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{so this is where forrestal cashed in.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{a friend of yours?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{competitor. he was good, very good.}
<C>__{barranca}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{no one has ever come out of there alive. why should we put our faith in you?}
<A>__{indy takes the weird feather from the band of his hat. from around its point, he slips a tightly rolled piece of parchment. barranca and satipo exchange a quick "so that's where is was!" look. they all kneel as indy spreads out the parchment. on it is one half of a crude floorplan of the temple.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{no one ever had what we have... partners.}
<A>__{indy fixes them with an expectant stare. satipo produces a similar, but folded, piece of parchment. he lays it the other half of the floorplan next to indy's. they all regard it for a moment, then indy stands and walks toward the temple. barranca's eyes are shining as they dart between the floorplan and satipo.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(back turned)}
<D>__{assuming that pillar there marks the corner and...}
<A>__{barranca is suddenly on his feet, quietly drawing his pistol. he raises it toward indy as satipo realizes with alarm what he's doing. too late. indy's head turns and he sees barranca. indy's next move is amazing, graceful and fast, yet totally unhurried. his right hand slides up under the back of his leather jacket and emerges grasping the handle of a neatly curled bullwhip. with the same fluid move that brings indy's body around to face the peruvian, the whip uncoils to its full ten foot length and flashes out. the fall of the whip (the unplaited strip at the end of the lash) wraps itself around barranca's hand and pistol. he could not drop the gun now if he tried. indy gives the whip a short pull and barranca's arm in jerked down, where it involuntarily discharges the gun into the dirt. barranca is amazed, but feels some slack in the whip and immediately raises the gun toward indy again, cocking it with his free hand. indy's face goes hard. and sad. indy sweeps his arm in a wide arc. barranca spins around, enclosed in the whip, his gun hand stuck tight against his body. indy gives one more short jerk on the whip handle and barranca's gun fires. barranca falls dead. indy looks quickly at satipo, who is shocked and frightened. he raises his arms in supplication.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{i knew nothing! he was crazy! please!}
<A>__{indy looks him over, then nods. he frees the whip from barranca's body and picks up the man. his eyes sweep the surrounding woods.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{let's go.}
<L>__{interior temple inclined passage day}
<A>__{indy and satipo, carrying a torch, walk up the slightly inclined, tubular passage from the main entrance. the interior is wet and dark, hanging with plant life and stalactites. their echoing footsteps intermittently overpower the sounds of loud dripping, whistling air drafts and scampering claws.}
<B>__{hall of shadows}
<A>__{indy leads the way down a twisting hallway, satipo's torch barely lighting his way from behind. indy disappears in a shadow and when he reappears a moment later a huge black tarantula is crawling up the back of his jacket. indy doesn't notice and disappears into another shadow, emerging with two more tarantulas on his back. satipo sees them and makes a frightened grunting sound. indy looks at him, sees what he's pointing at and casually brushes all three spiders off with his rolled whip, as he would a fly. satipo pirouettes for an inspection and indy flicks one off the peruvian's back. indy begins picking up little pocket sized artifacts from the niches and ledges of the temple. he continues to do this as the men penetrate the temple. his collecting is quick and expert, evaluating the pieces in an instant, discarding some, stuffing others into his clothes, and never stopping his forward progress.}
<B>__{chamber of light}
<A>__{the men reach an arch in the hall. the small chamber ahead, which interrupts the hall, is brightly lit by a shaft of sunlight from high above. indy stops, looks it over.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{what's wrong? are you lost?}
<A>__{indy picks up a stick and throws it through the shaft of light. giant spikes spring together from the sides of the chamber with a ferocious clang! and impaled on the spikes are the remains of a white man, half fleshed, half skeleton, in explorer type grab. indy reaches out and takes hold of the man's carcass. as the spikes slowly retract, indy pulls it free and seats the remains gently on the floor.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{forrestal.}
<C>__{satipo}
<P>__{(gulps)}
<D>__{we can go no further.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{now, satipo, we don't want to be discouraged by every little thing.}
<A>__{indy steps sideways into the chamber. his back pressed against the very points of the retracted spikes, he moves along the edge of the light beam, and steps clear on the other side. satipo grimaces and begins sweating his way through.}
<B>__{stairway}
<A>__{indy and satipo come down stone stairs to a tight landing. framing the entry are a carefully strung network of dead vines, each somehow hooked into the wall, narrowing the opening even more.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(taking torch)}
<D>__{let me see that.}
<A>__{he lowers the torch to the floor of the landing. the landing is carpeted with human skeletons, one on top of another, all squashed flat as cardboard. satipo gasps. indy looks up at the ceiling of the landing, then steps onto skeletons, which make a cracking noise under his feet.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{try not to touch the vines.}
<B>__{foyer of the sanctuary}
<A>__{the men are in a high, straight hallway 50 feet long. the door at the end is flooded with sunlight.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{senor, i think we are very close.}
<A>__{indy stands still looking at the hall.}
<C>__{satipo}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{let us hurry. there is nothing to fear here.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{that's what scares me.}
<A>__{they begin walking down the hall side by side. satipo has inched a little ahead. suddenly his lead foot comes down and through the floor! as satipo begins to pitch forward, indy grabs him by the belt and pulls him back. they both look down at the "floor". indy swings his whip across the floor. fifteen feet of it cuts open beneath the lash, falling away to reveal black pit as wide as the hall. the illusory floor was made of dust covered cobwebs. satipo picks up a stone and drops it down the pit. no sound. the two men exchange glances. indy looks up at the high roof of the hall. he swings the whip up around a support beam, tests its strength with a pull and swings over the pit on the whip. from the other side he swings the whip back to satipo, who throws indy the torch. satipo swings across. when they are both standing on solid floor there is a moment of quiet in which they hear, from far, far below splash! indy wedges the whip handle into the wall and leaves it strung to the beam for quick retreat.}
<B>__{the sanctuary}
<A>__{a large, domed room. ten evenly spaced skylights send their shafts of sunlight down to a unique tiled floor: white and black tiles laid out in a lovely, intricate pattern. indy and satipo stand at the door and look across the wide room at the altar. there, in the supreme hallowed spot, is a tiny jeweled figurine, indy's real objective. two torches, many years old, are in holders by the door. indy takes one down and lights it. he gives the regular torch to satipo.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{there's plenty of light, amigo.}
<A>__{indy kneels and uses the unlit end of the torch to reach out and tap a white tile. it is solid. he taps a black tile. there is a whizzing sound and a tiny dark sticks in the torch. satipo points to the wall nearby: there is a recessed hole there.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{from that hole!}
<A>__{indy nods, stands and looks around the sanctuary. the entire room is honey comed with the same kind of hole. satipo sees it too and is properly impressed.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{you wait here.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{if you insist, senor.}
<A>__{torch in hand, indy begins his careful walk across the sanctuary. stepping only on the white tiles, he almost appears to be doing a martial arts kata. before each big move he waves the torch in front of him head to toe, looking at the flame. halfway out, he sees something on the floor and kneels to look at it. a dead bird lies on one of the white tiles. its body is riddled with little deadly darts. this has great significance to indy and he stands with even greater caution. he waves the torch ahead of him and at waist height an air current whips at the flame. indy ducks under it and leaves a burn mark on the white tile beneath it. satipo watches, wide eyed and mystified. indy reaches the altar. the tiny idol looks both fierce and beautiful. it rests on a pedestal of polished stone. indy looks the whole set up over very carefully. from his jacket he takes a small, canvas drawstring bad. he begins filling it with dirt from around the case of the altar. when he has created a weight that he thinks approximates the weight of the idol, he bounces it a couple times in his palm concentrating. it's clear he wants to replace the idol with the bag as smoothly as possible. his hand seems ready to do that once, when he stops, takes a breath and loosens his shoulder muscles. now he sets himself again. and makes the switch! the idol is now in his hand, the bag on the pedestal. for a long moment it sits there, then the polished stone beneath the bag drops five inches. this sets off an aural chain reaction of steadily increasing volume as some huge mysterious mechanism rumbles into action deep in the temple. indy spins and starts his kata back across the sanctuary at four times the speed. satipo's eyes widen in terror. he turns and runs. the retreat intercutting indy and satipo the sanctuary has begun to rumble and shake in response to the mysterious mechanism. just as indy goes out the door, a rock shakes loose from the wall and rolls onto the tiles floor. immediately, a noisy torrent of poison darts fills the room.}
<B>__{in the foyer}
<A>__{satipo swings across the pit. he makes it just as the whip comes undone from the beam, leaving indy without an escape. satipo, extremely nervous, regards the whip a moment then turns back to face indy, who has run up to the far side of the pit.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{no time to argue. throw me the idol, i throw you the whip.}
<A>__{indy hesitates, eyeing the rumbling walls.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{you have no choice! hurry!}
<A>__{indy concurs with that assessment. he tosses the idol across the pit to satipo. satipo stuffs it in the front pocket of his jacket, gives indy a look, then drops the whip on the floor and runs.}
<C>__{satipo}
<D>__{adios, amigo!}
<A>__{indy grimaces. he had a feeling this might happen. he looks around.}
<B>__{at the vined landing}
<A>__{satipo flies through like a chubby ballet dancer and takes the steps five at a time.}
<B>__{in the foyer}
<A>__{indy runs in full stride to the edge of the pit and broad jumps into space. he doesn't make it. his body hits the far side of the pit and he begins to slide out of view. only wild clawing with his fingers at the edge of the pit stops his descent. with just the tips of his fingers over the edge, he begins pulling himself up.}
<B>__{at the chamber of light}
<A>__{satipo has slowed down. he begins to edge carefully around the light shaft.}
<B>__{at the vined landing}
<A>__{indy sails through sideways and rolls to a stop at the bottom of the steps. his whip is grasped in his hand. as he raises himself, he hears, from above the giant spikes of the chamber of light clang! and an abrupt, sickening rendition of satipo's last scream. indy runs up the steps. the rumbling sound grows louder.}
<B>__{at the chamber of light}
<A>__{indy slides to a stop. the spikes have retracted, taking satipo's body to one side. indy edges into the chamber with his back to the shaft of light. soon he is face to face with the dead satipo; spikes protrude from several vital spots in the peruvian's body. indy removes the idol from satipo's pocket and moves quickly out the other side.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{adios.}
<B>__{the inclined passage}
<A>__{indy shoots out of a cut off hallway and turns toward the exit. the rumbling is very loud and now we see why: right behind indy a huge boulder comes roaring around a corner of the passage, perfectly form fitted to the passageway. it obliterates everything before it, sending the stalactites shooting ahead like missiles. indy dashes for the light of the exit. his hat flies off his head. almost immediately it is crushed by the boulder. indy dives out the end of the passage as the boulder slams to a perfect fit at the entrance, sealing the temple.}
<L>__{exterior front of the temple day}
<A>__{indy lies on the ground, gasping for air. a shadow falls across him and he looks up.}
<B>__{what he sees}
<A>__{looming above him are three figures. two are hovitos warriors in full battle paint and loin cloths. they carry long blow guns. but the man in the center draws indy's attention. he is a tall, impressive white man, dressed in full safari outfit including pith helmet. his name is emile belloq. his face is thin, powerful; his eyes hypnotic; his smile charming, yet lethal. his heavily french accented speech is deep, mellifluous, wonderful. back beyond belloq and his two escorts, thirty more hovitos warriors hover at the edge of the trees.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{dr. jones, you choose the wrong friends. this time it will cost you.}
<A>__{belloq extends his hand. indy looks at it, then produces the idol and hands it to belloq. belloq extends his other hand, smiling. indy hands over his gun. belloq sticks it in his jacket.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{and you thought i'd given up.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(eyeing the hovitos)}
<D>__{too bad they don't know you like i do, belloq.}
<C>__{belloq}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{yes, too bad. you could warn them... if only you spoke hovitos.}
<A>__{with that, belloq turns dramatically and holds the idol high for all the hovitos to see and says something in hovitos. there is a murmur of recognition and all the indians, including belloq's escorts, prostrate themselves upon the ground, heads down. indy is immediately up and running toward the edge of the clearing.}
<C>__{belloq}
<P>__{(in hovitos)}
<D>__{kill him!}
<B>__{at the edge of the clearing}
<A>__{indy disappears into the foliage. an instant later, the leaves are peppered with a rain of poison darts and spears.}
<L>__{exterior the jungle indy's run various shots day}
<A>__{indy runs like hell through steadily falling terrain. and always close behind, a swift gang of angry hovitos. occasionally they get close enough to send a dart or spear whizzing past indy's head.}
<L>__{exterior the urubamba river dusk}
<A>__{an amphibian plane sits in the water beneath a green cliff. sitting on the wing is jock, the british pilot. indy breaks out of some distant brush and runs along the path at the top of the cliff.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{get it going! get it going!}
<A>__{jock hops in and fires up the plane's engines. indy reaches a spot on the cliff above the place, glances back, them jumps into the river. he comes up, swims to the plane and grabs a strut.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{jock starts the plane moving across the water as indy walks across the wing and falls into the passenger compartment.}
<L>__{interior jock's plane dusk}
<A>__{indy relaxes and lies across the seat, a big smile on his face. one hand drops to the floor of the cabin and indy jumps, hitting his head. on the floor of the cabin is a huge boa constrictor. indy tries to get his whole body onto the seat. jock sees what's happening.}
<C>__{jock}
<D>__{don't mind him. that's reggie. wouldn't hurt a soul.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i can't stand snakes.}
<C>__{jock}
<D>__{the world's full of them, you know.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i hate them.}

<A>__{it's autumn and the pretty, new england campus out indy's window reflects it in dazzling color. a few weeks before the start of classes. activity just picking up. some students about. indy is at a bookcase near the window and he looks quite different in this setting. his outfit is tweedy, slightly rumpled in the professional style. part of his attention is focused in a book and he wears glasses to see the fine printerior the office is cramped, absolutely inundated with books, maps, etchings and archeological artifacts. in fact, the only neat spot in the room right now is indy's desk, which has been cleared off expressly for the benefit of }
<B>__{marcus brody}
<A>__{the curator of the national museum in washington, d.c. brody is examining the small artifacts indy pocketed on his way into the peruvian temple. he occasionally uses a jeweler's eyepiece to get a closer look. but he is distracted, his concerns elsewhere, and it is this that his old friend indy senses from across the room.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{do you think the idol will ever show up?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i don't know. just because belloq had it doesn't mean he kept it.}
<A>__{indy snaps the book closed and puts it on the shelf. he takes his glasses off and focuses on brody. at the windowed door to his office, two pretty coeds pause for a moment, look in at their sexy archeology professor, giggle and disappear.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{getting it away from those indians would be a neat trick}
<P>__{(a hard look)}
<D>__{i hope they got him.}
<A>__{a young male graduate student, indy's teaching assistant, taps on the door and then pushes his way in with an armload of reference books. indy helps him find a spot for them.}
<C>__{teaching assistant}
<D>__{i couldn't get the mcnabe, professor. someone's got it checked out 'til next month when classes start.}

<P>__{(eager to please)}
<D>__{will there be anything else?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{no. i will see you thursday.}
<A>__{the teaching assistant leaves. brody is scowling as he examines the last of the artifacts.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{hey, if you don't like them, i can always return them.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{no, they're beautiful. the museum will buy them as usual. no questions asked.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{then what's wrong?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i brought along some people today.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{what kind of people?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{government.}

<A>__{indy's course a combination of archeology and anthropology is taught in this amphitheater type lecture hall. his desk and lectern hold large reference books; blackboards line the wall. bones, maps, charts festoon the walls. indy leans against his desk talking with brody and two uniformed army officers, colonel musgrove and major eaton, who are situated around the first seats in the classroom.}
<C>__{musgrove}
<D>__{but you did study under professor ravenwood at the university of chicago?}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{we haven't spoken in ten years. i'm afraid we had a bit of a falling out.}
<C>__{eaton}
<D>__{you know nothing of his whereabouts?}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(negative)}
<D>__{just rumors. somewhere in asia, last i heard.}
<A>__{musgrove and eaton exchange a look; they're disappointed.}
<C>__{eaton}
<P>__{(to musgrove)}
<D>__{maybe dr. jones can make sense of it.}
<A>__{again the military men have a silent communication, deciding what to reveal.}
<C>__{musgrove}
<D>__{well... you must understand, dr. jones, this is all strictly confidential.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{musgrove}
<D>__{yesterday, one of our european sections intercepted a nazi communique from cairo to berlin. we don't quite know what to make of it.}
<A>__{musgrove takes a sheet from his briefcase.}
<C>__{musgrove}
<D>__{here it is "tanis development proceeding. acquire headpiece, staff of ra, general tengtu hok, shanghai. locate abner ravenwood, u.s."}
<A>__{brody is excited. he looks at indy.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{tanis. they must have discovered the lost ruins.}

<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{tanis. ain't that somethin'!}
<C>__{eaton}
<D>__{frankly, we're a little suspicious... an american being mentioned so prominently in a secret nazi cable.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{ah, ravenwood's no nazi.}
<C>__{eaton}
<D>__{then what do they want him for?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{they're looking for the headpiece to the staff of ra.}
<C>__{musgrove}
<P>__{(indicates his sheet)}
<D>__{but it says here that's in china.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{only half of it. ravenwood had the other half.}
<C>__{eaton}
<D>__{what would the nazis want with this this staff of ra?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i can tell you that. over the last two years the nazis have had teams of archeologists running around the world looking for all kinds of religious artifacts.}
<C>__{musgrove}
<D>__{that's right. hitler's a nut on the subject. crazy. he's obsessed with the occult.}
<C>__{eaton}
<D>__{what is this staff of ra, anyway?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{it all has to do with the ark of the covenant.}
<P>__{(the army guys look mystified)}
<D>__{the chest the hebrews used to carry around the ten commandments.}
<A>__{now it's the army men who are impressed.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{an egyptian pharaoh stole the ark from jerusalem and took it back to the city of tanis. a short time later, tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm that lasted a year. but before that, the pharaoh had had the ark hidden away in a secret chamber called the well of the souls. which is where the staff of ra comes in.}
<A>__{indy moves to the blackboard and makes a quick sketch to give a rough idea of the system as he describes it. (and we get a glimpse of what an interesting and enthusiastic teacher he must be).}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{now this was rather clever. the staff was really just a big stick oh, i don't know, say like this }
<P>__{(he indicates about six feet)}
<D>__{no one really knows for sure. any way, it was capped by an elaborate headpiece with a carving of the sun at the top. what you had to do was take the staff to a special map room in tanis it had the whole city laid out in miniature on the floor. when you placed the staff in a certain spot in this room, at a certain time of day, the sun would shine through a hole here in the headpiece and then send a beam of light down here to the map giving you the location of the well of the souls...}
<C>__{musgrove}
<D>__{...where the ark of the covenant was kept.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{which is probably what the nazis are after.}
<C>__{eaton}
<D>__{what's this ark look like?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{look like? why, it's right here...}
<A>__{indy pulls a big format book from the stack on his lectern and flips through the pages until he finds a large color printerior the other men gather to look.}
<B>__{the print}
<A>__{fills the screen. it shows a biblical battle. the israelite army is vanquishing an opposition force. at the forefront of the israelite ranks, two men carry the ark of the covenant, a beautiful gold chest, crowned by two sculptured gold angels. the men do not touch the ark itself; rather they carry it by use of two long wooden poles which pass through rings in the corners of the ark. the painting is very dramatic, full of smoke, tumult and sinewy dying men. but the most astounding thing in the picture is the brilliant jet of white light and flame issuing from the wings of the angels. it pierces deep into the ranks of the retreating enemy, wreaking devastation and terror.}
<C>__{eaton}
<D>__{good god!}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{yes. that's what the hebrews thought.}
<C>__{musgrove}
<D>__{what's that supposed to be coming out of there?}
<C>__{indy}
