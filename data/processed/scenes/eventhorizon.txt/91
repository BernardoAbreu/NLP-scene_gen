<D>__{ms. peters, turn back and to your left, please.}
<A>__{on her monitor, peters' pov shifts as she complies.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{what is it?}

<A>__{peters reaches towards a small video deck. touches the eject button. nothing happens.}
<C>__{peters}
<D>__{it's stuck.}

<A>__{justin's light bounces off an even larger pressure door, built like a bank vault. the second seal.}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{i've reached another containment door. this thing's huge...}
<C>__{weir }
<P>__{(radio)}
<D>__{that's the second containment seal. beyond that, engineering.}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{i'm going in.}
<A>__{justin opens the seal. it releases slowly, inching open. justin squeezes through.}

<A>__{peters takes a small probe from her belt, inserts it into the video deck. a small laser disc emerges partway from the deck. peters pulls on it. it doesn't move.}
<C>__{peters}
<D>__{it's really jammed in there.}
<A>__{a shadow crosses the window behind her. someone something is in there with her... peters pulls harder. nothing. another effort. the disc pulls free. peters spins in the zero gravity, spinning into... ...a body floating at the helm, the face illuminated by peters' helmet lights. his swollen tongue clogs his gaping, screaming mouth. his cracked and crystallized skin is crossed by a network of bloated veins. he has no eyes. just like weir's dream.}
