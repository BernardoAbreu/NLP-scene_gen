<L>__{ext chalet night}
<A>__{the men make way as victor carries his dead wife through the downpour. he puts her in the coach. dazed.}
<L>__{ext road night}
<A>__{the coach comes racing through the storm, the horses in a frenzy, faster and faster.}
<L>__{ext mansion night}
<A>__{victor whipping the coach veers to a wild stop. victor jumps down, gathers up the body, and mounts the steps. henry appears, rushing out into the rain. victor goes right past him... mansion night ...and carries elizabeth through the silent halls. attic night the door swings in. victor stands dripping. holding elizabeth. gazing at the gleam of copper...}
<T>__{montage:}
<A>__{and we launch into the final throbbing madness. victor hacking and chopping. discarding pieces. sewing the creation, yanking the catgut tight. ramming the needles deep. hoisting the body in the air. slamming the sarcophagus lid, tightening the bolts. powering up the galvanic circuit, throwing the switch. screaming at god as the lightning flashes and the body convulses. wind and rain sweeping through the lab, battering a window open and shut, open and shut. lowering the glass tube, ramming phallus into womb. releasing the eels, huge black sperm squirming and writhing toward the spasming egg the body. convulsing. lashing. screaming in the copper womb. hair whipping in the fluid... victor shuts down the machinery. he opens the tank and reaches into the fluid with his thick rubber gloves. he pulls out his creation, cradling the head and neck as one would cradle a newborn infant's... ...and wipes the muck away with his glove to reveal elizabeth's face, massive suture marks bisect her neck and collarbone where pieces were joined. a whisper:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{live.}
<A>__{her eyes flies open as consciousness hits, mouth gaping to draw air but finding fluid in the lungs. she erupts, thrashing in the vat. he clutches her tight, pounding her back to start her breathing, calming the convulsing creaturess with soft murmured words of tenderness and love as her lungs heave violently to dispel the fluid... he lifts her gently out. wipes off the muck as she shivers and shakes, spasms easing off. cleansing her face. clasping her hand in his. comfort and strength... helping her to her feet. jerky and unsure. lean on me. replacing the sheer nightgown on her scarred and naked body, draping it... and finally, exhaustingly, tilting her chin up with his fingers to gaze into her eyes. a whisper:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{say my name.}
<A>__{blank. dazed. stunned. not a flicker of recognition.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{elizabeth. say my name. say you remember. say my name.}
<A>__{nothing. he leans forward... and kisses her dead lips. gentle as a sigh. a flicker in her eyes?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you must. you must.}
<A>__{maybe his imagination. still whispering:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{say my name. say you remember.}
<A>__{and slowly... ever so slowly... she raises her bony white hand before her eyes... staring at it... trying to puzzle it out... its meaning... perhaps the vaguest shred of recognition... and the hand continues to rise... creeping slowly toward his shoulder... and coming to rest there. he smiles, blinking back tears...}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{yes. i will help you remember.}
<A>__{and he takes her other hand in his. at first it's imperceptible... just the slightest motion, perhaps nothing, perhaps just a shift of balance... and then it grows into the vaguest sway... and tears are glistening in victor's eyes as she begins to move. lurching. faltering. unsure. you must lead, victor. the lady will always look to you for guidance, so your steps must be sure and strong. trace memories. a waltz. and here we are treated to the most sweepingly romantic and hair raisingly demented image of the film: frankenstein dances with his dead bride, showing her the way, begging her to remember, please remember, and now our waltz love theme really comes back to haunt us as the music swells, incredibly lush and deranged, dissonant and echoing through victor's head, music only he can hear...}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{...one two three, twirl two three.}
<A>__{...and the worst part? the very worst thing of all? there on the shelf. a large formaldehyde jar. justine's severed head. watching them through the glass with dead, sightless eyes. watching them dance. still a wallflower? no. she's finally finishing her dance with victor... most of her, anyway. under the circumstances, it'll have to do... ...and the waltz goes on, madder and madder, sweeping in glorious circles as a dazzling array of lightning bathes them in its wild, jittering spotlight, shadows careening across the walls, insane music swelling louder and louder, climbing higher and higher, reaching toward its crescendo with jagged glass claws... ...and it all screeches to a stop as the door bursts in. music echoes abruptly away into silence. nothing now but rain and distant thunder. in the doorway:}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{she's beautiful.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{she's not for you.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{i'm sure the lady knows her own mind. doesn't she? let her decide the proper suitor.}
<A>__{the creature raises his hand. beckoning. she takes a faltering step. drawn to him.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{elizabeth, no!}
<P>__{(she turns, puzzled)}
<D>__{say my name.}
<A>__{her face reflects horror and shame, like a brain damaged child who's wet the bed. she knows she's supposed to remember... but can't remember what remembering means. they both motion to her. murmuring. begging. she's caught between them, pulled like a diaphanous rope in a tug of war. please... come with me. please... remember. she finally tilts toward the creature. gazing into his eyes. studying his face. fingertips tracing his massively scarred flesh. a beat. a frown. a puzzlement. this isn't right. people don't look like this. they're not stitched together out of pieces of flesh like a patchwork. she looks at her own hands. dead and white. not even hers. one belongs to justine. another to a prostitute, suture scars marring the wrist. she looks down at herself. the dead, sagging breasts. the body that isn't hers either. realization creeping into her eyes. realization and horror. turning to victor. why do i look like this? what's happened to me? oh god, what's happened to me?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{vic... tor?}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{...no...}
<A>__{...and she lets out a shriek, a banshee wail from the deepest pits of hell. screaming at them both. screaming at herself. she goes berserk, trying to claw her flesh away, trying to find the real elizabeth underneath the horror, trying to peel it away, clawing at her face. trying to claw out her own eyes. victor lunges to restrain her, screaming himself, veering toward final utter madness like strings snapping on a violin. the creature grabs him, hurls him aside.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{get away from her! she's mine!}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{she'll never be yours! she said my name! she remembers!}
<A>__{yes. she remembers. not much, but enough. she breaks away from them as they grapple, still shrieking as she sails across the room, tipping furniture, equipment flying... ...over straight to the kerosene lamp, snatching it up before they can stop her.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she spins to face them, holding them breathlessly at bay with the threat of the lamp, twitching from one to the other. but it's not just the lamp, it's the look of sheer loathing in her eyes. loathing for them for what they've done to her... loathing for herself for what she's become. it turns out the lady does know her own mind. she wants no part of it... or them. decision made. she crushes the lamp in her bare hands, drenching herself in a cascade of kerosene. whoooosh! she goes up like a blazing matchstick and darts past them, still shrieking, still trying to claw the dead flesh away, pulling off giant flaming pieces of herself as she careens out the door and down the steps, victor and the creature racing after her...}
