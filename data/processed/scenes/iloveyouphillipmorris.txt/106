<A>__{eudora waits on a bench in the corridor, nervously glancing at her watch. steven stands behind a column down the hall hiding and watching. he looks at his watch, then approaches her.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{sorry i'm late but i've been hung up in court all day. let's go in.}
<L>__{interior houston courtroom, 1995 day}
<A>__{steven's pov: a beautifully ornate courthouse light fixture hangs from a courthouse ceiling. on steven, staring up at it with admiration.}
<C>__{judge }
<D>__{mister russell?}
<A>__{steven snaps out of it and responds to a waiting judge.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{it's a beautiful fixture.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i know. it's your turn.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{oh...}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{your honor, ms. mixon engaged mr. gage service in good faith and was given an inferior product. she is entitled to deem that work to be unacceptable according to the contract that mr. evans signed.}
<C>__{lawyer}
<D>__{the terms of that contract were ambiguous at best. the truth is, defendant engaged my client for three years without full payment.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{your honor i have, in my briefcase, fourteen other contracts, all on public record, in which mr. evans entered into litigation with past clients of his!}
<A>__{eudora glances into steven's opened briefcase. it contains only a sandwich and a photo of phillip. the shocked lawyer turns to his client (evans).}
<C>__{lawyer}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{is this true?}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lawyer}
<D>__{you're making me look like an idiot.}
<A>__{he regroups and addresses the judge.}
<C>__{lawyer }
<D>__{your honor, i don't have to tell you that none of this is admissable or applicable to the case at hand. mr. russell's histrionics do not erase the fact that his client is in breech of contract.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{he is right mr. russell what do you have to say?}
<A>__{steven is stonewalled. he looks to eudora as if to say, "what do i do now?" and it terrifies her. desperate, steven bangs his fist on the table and looks resolutely to the judge.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i demand to be seen in chambers!!}
<A>__{the judge and lawyer seem mystified by this response.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{okaaaaaaaay...}
