<L>__{interior barber shop morning}
<A>__{... her father. todd's face, staring out the window, intense and brooding. seething with discontent. mrs. lovett chatters as she moves around behind him:}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{... it's not much of a chair, i will grant, but it'll serve. was me poor albert's chair. sat in it all day long he did, after his leg give out from the gout, poor dear.}
<A>__{he moves from the window and paces like a caged tiger in the small barber shop. though it has been cleaned, it is still a spartan room. a tatty parlor chair. a large chest. a few counters with meager bottles of tonsorial supplies. and his gleaming razors, always waiting.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{why doesn't the beadle come? "before the week is out," that's what he said.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{and who says the week's out? it's only tuesday.}
<A>__{todd moves away from her, she pursues, trying to calm and soothe him...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{easy now. hush, love, hush. don't distress yourself, what's your rush? keep your thoughts nice and lush. wait.}
<P>__{(he continues to pace)}
<D>__{hush, love, hush. think it through. once it bubbles, then what's to do? watch it close. let it brew. wait.}
<A>__{he does not respond. she dares to move closer...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{i've been thinking, flowers maybe daisies to brighten up the room. don't you think some flowers, pretty daisies, might relieve the gloom? ah, wait, love, wait.}
<A>__{todd sourly tosses himself into the chair, he picks up his largest razor and looks at it intensely:}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(to razor)}
<D>__{and the judge? when will we get to him?}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{can't you think of nothing else? always broodin' away on yer wrongs what happened heaven knows how many years ago... don't you know, silly man, half the fun is to plan the plan? all good things come to those who can wait.}
<A>__{her gentle words have calmed him considerably. she moves even closer. risks touching him softly...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{gillyflowers, maybe, `stead of daisies... i don't know, though... what do you think?}
<A>__{then todd tilts the razor in his hand suddenly the face of the gentleman a flash reflected in the razor then a bell rings from outside the shop the effect is electric todd bolts up, senses alert mrs. lovett spins to the door todd holds his razor open as he moves strategically toward the door we hear footsteps ascending the stairs outside quickly then anthony enters, breathless }
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{mr. todd! thank god i've found you }
<P>__{(todd turns, closing the}
<D>__{razor, as anthony sees}
<P>__{mrs. lovett)}
<D>__{... oh, i'm sorry, excuse me...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{mrs. lovett, sir.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{a pleasure, ma'am }
<P>__{(continues to todd)}
<D>__{ you see, there's a girl who needs my help such a sad girl, and lonely, but beautiful too and }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{slow down, anthony.}
<C>__{anthony}
<P>__{(takes a breath)}
<D>__{yes, i'm sorry ... this girl has a guardian so tyrannical that he keeps her locked away. but then this morning she dropped this ...}
<P>__{(produces the key)}
<D>__{... it must be a sign that johanna wants me to help her that's her name, johanna and turpin that of her guardian. a judge of some sort...}
<A>__{todd and mrs. lovett exchange a quick glance as anthony continues:}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{... i've met him, mr. todd, and he is unnatural ... once he goes to court, i'm going to slip into the house and release her and beg her to come away with me. tonight.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{oh, this is all terribly romantic.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{yes, but you see i don't know anyone in london }
<P>__{(to todd)}
<D>__{ and i need somewhere safe to bring her till i've hired a coach to take us to plymouth.}
<A>__{he looks at todd deeply:}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{if i could keep her here, just for an hour or two, i would forever be in your debt.}
<A>__{todd stares at him, his mind racing to figure out how this new twist might aid in his plans. it is mrs. lovett who smoothly replies:}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{bring her here, dear.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{thank you, ma'am ...}
<P>__{(to todd)}
<D>__{... mr. todd?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{the girl may come.}
<C>__{anthony}
<P>__{(taking his hand)}
<D>__{thank you, my friend.}
<A>__{he goes.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{seems like the fates are favoring you at last, mr. t.}
<P>__{(todd grunts, unhappy)}
<D>__{what is it, love? you'll have her back before the day is out.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{for a few hours? before he carries her off to the other end of england?}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{oh, him? let him bring her here and then, since you're so hot for a little }
<P>__{(makes a throat cutting gesture)}
<D>__{ that's the throat to slit, dear.}
<A>__{todd moves again to his post at the window, he stares out, deep in thought. meanwhile, she happily moves around the shop, straightening things up and trying to make it all a bit more cozy:}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{poor little johanna. all those years without a scrap of motherly affection. well, we'll soon see to that...}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(alert, sees something)}
<D>__{what's this?}
<A>__{mrs. lovett joins him at the window. below, they see pirelli approaching with toby in tow.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{look at that face, he's up to mischief.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{go keep the boy below with you.}
<A>__{she nods and scurries out. we go with her...}
