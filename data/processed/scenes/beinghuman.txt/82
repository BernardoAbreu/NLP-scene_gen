<A>__{beatrice turns to him when they are inside.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{here we are... home... you want some food... and then i will show you everything. we have a spring ... you can wash...}
<A>__{hector stands looking around the small dark room. beatrice suddenly seems shy and awkward.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{this is when i wish you could understand me. you'll have to learn, you know... i want you to stay here. you want to, don't you?}
<A>__{hector looks at her in silence.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{i look after the hens, and i make dyes from the plants, and perfumes too. i'm good at that. but i'm no good with the sheep and the goats. i wish you could understand... arnaud's been dead two years...}
<A>__{she crosses the room to a wooden chest under the window. she lifts the lid and removes some men's clothing, rough working trousers and a hide jacket.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{i still have his clothes. i will make them fit you...}
<A>__{she holds the jacket up against hector to measure it. hector's reaction to a dead man's clothing is predictable.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{what did he die of?}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{i'm getting shy. imagine me being shy with you... i made this for him... tonight we'll try them on. you're the same height as arnaud, but a little thinner. i will make them fit. i'm a good sewer. and we have a big bed upstairs for you and me, in the rafters... you and me... sleep...}
<A>__{hector is beginning to understand what she means, but he keeps his feelings to himself. beatrice talks on. now that she has started, she wants to say it all.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{i like you. you like me too, don't you? we were lucky to meet the way we did. all the men around here are old.}
<A>__{beatrice falls silent, overtaken by her shyness. hector understands fully what she means now, but his mind is a confusion. he can't respond. she tries to direct his thoughts to the one area she is sure about.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{come up and i will show you the bed...}
<A>__{she climbs a ladder nearby and lifts open a trapdoor on the wooden ceiling. hector climbs up to join her and together they stand on the ladder with their heads poking into the tiny space above.}
