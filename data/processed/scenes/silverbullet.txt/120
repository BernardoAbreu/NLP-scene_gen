<L>__{interior the den, with nan and uncle al night}
<A>__{uncle al is clearing up in a kind of drunken stupor and i mean he is really drunk. he's smoking one cigarette; another is smoldering away in the heaping ashtray. he drops a pile of baseball cards on the floor and bonks his head on the table bending down to pick them up.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{i don't want you drinking around marty. that's too much. if you can't stop it, you better stay away.}
<A>__{al straightens up. there is a sort of command force in this man, and here he is partly able to rise above his abysmal drunkenness so we can see it.}
<C>__{uncle al}
<D>__{i come here because marty needs a friend.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{yes... you've always been that to him. but if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.}
<A>__{she leaves the room, almost crying. uncle al looks after her, and then his attention is drawn to the smoldering ashtray. he pours beer over the mess, putting out the fire but creating something that looks even worse. he begins drunkenly picking up again.}
<C>__{uncle al }
<D>__{another wonderful time at sister nan's house! heeyyy!}
