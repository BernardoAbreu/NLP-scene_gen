<D>__{voice over a way out west there was a fella, fella i want to tell you about, fella by the name of jeff lebowski. at least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. this lebowski, he called himself the dude. now, dude, that's a name no one would self apply where i come from. but then, there was a lot about the dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. and a lot about where he lived, like wise. but then again, maybe that's why i found the place s'durned innarestin'.}

<D>__{voice over now this story i'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties just about the time of our conflict with sad'm and the eye rackies. i only mention it 'cause some times there's a man i won't say a hee ro, 'cause what's a hee ro? but sometimes there's a man.}

<A>__{the pomeranian is excitedly yapping at walter's elbow, making high body twisting tail wagging leaps.}

<C>__{dude}
<D>__{walter, you can't do that. these guys're like me, they're pacificists. smokey was a conscientious objector.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you know dude, i myself dabbled with pacifism at one pointerior not in nam, of course }
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{and you know smokey has emotional problems!}

<C>__{walter}
<D>__{that's your answer to everything, dude. and let me point out pacifism is not look at our current situation with that camelfucker in iraq pacifism is not something to hide behind.}

<D>__{dude, this is smokey. look, i don't wanna be a hard on about this, and i know it wasn't your fault, but i just thought it was fair to tell you that gene and i will be submitting this to the league and asking them to set aside the round. or maybe forfeit it to us }
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{shit!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{ so, like i say, just thought, you know, fair warning. tell walter.}

<C>__{another voice}
<D>__{mr. lebowski, this is fred dynarski with the southern cal bowling league. i just got a, an informal report, uh, that a uh, a member of your team, uh, walter sobchak, drew a loaded weapon during league play }
<A>__{we hear the doorbell.}
<B>__{the door}
<A>__{it swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding middle aged man in a black t shirt and black cut off jeans.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{hiya allan.}
<C>__{allan}
<D>__{dude, i finally got the venue i wanted. i'm performing my dance quintet you know, my cycle at crane jackson's fountain street theatre on tuesday night, and i'd love it if you came and gave me notes.}

<B>__{tracking}
<A>__{we are pushing brandt down the high ceilinged hallway. distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano. brandt talks back over}
<T>__{his shoulder:}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{we've had some terrible news. mr. lebowski is in seclusion in the west wing.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{huh.}
<A>__{brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors. the music washes over us as we enter a great study where jeffrey lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares hauntedly into a fire, listening to lohengrin. brandt announces, ambiguously:}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{mr. lebowski.}
<A>__{jeffrey lebowski waves the dude in without looking around.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{it's funny. i can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome. i've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs. what. . . what makes a man, mr. lebowski?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{dude.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i don't know, sir.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing? whatever the price? isn't that what makes a man?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{sure. that and a pair of testicles.}
<A>__{lebowski turns away from the dude with a haunted stare, lost in thought.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{you're joking. but perhaps you're right.}
<A>__{the dude thumps at his chest pocket.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{mind if i smoke a jay?}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{bunny.}
<A>__{he turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on his cheeks.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{'scuse me?}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{bunny lebowski. . . she is the light of my life. are you surprised at my tears, sir?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{fuckin' a.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{strong men also cry. . . strong men also cry.}
<A>__{he clears his throat.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{i received this fax this morning.}
<A>__{brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and hands it to the dude.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{as you can see, it is a ransom note. sent by cowards. men who are unable to achieve on a level field of play. men who will not sign their names. weaklings. bums.}
<T>__{the dude examines the fax:}
<A>__{we have bunny. gather one million dollars in unmarked non }
<B>__{consecutive twenties. await instructions. no funny stuff.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{bummer.}
<A>__{lebowski looks soulfully at the dude.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{brandt will fill you in on the details.}
<A>__{he wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire. brandt tugs at the dude's shirt and points him back to the hall.}
<B>__{hallway}
<A>__{the soprano's singing is once again fainterior brandt's voice is hushed:}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{mr. lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{why me, man?}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{he suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{so he thinks it's the carpet pissers, huh?}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{well dude, we just don't know.}
<B>__{bowling pins}
<A>__{crash scattered by a strike, in slow motion.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{still in slow motion. we are looking across the length of the bowling alley at a tall, thin, hispanic bowler displaying perfect form. he wears an all in one dacron polyester stretch bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side.}
<B>__{fast track in}
<A>__{on the dude, sitting next to walter in the molded plastic chairs. the dude is staring off towards the bowler.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{fucking quintana that creep can roll, man }
<B>__{back to the bowler}
<A>__{displaying great slow motion form as the dude and walter's conversation continues over.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, dude.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{the man is a sex offender. with a record. spent six months in chino for exposing himself to an eight year old.}
<B>__{flashback}
<A>__{we see quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater, walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging the bell. the voice over conversation continues.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{when he moved down to venice he had to go door to door to tell everyone he's a pederast.}
<A>__{the door swings open and a beer swilling middle aged man looks dully out at quintana, who looks hesitantly up.}
<C>__{donny}
<D>__{what's a pederast, walter?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{shut the fuck up, donny.}
<B>__{pins}
<A>__{scattered by a strike.}
<B>__{quintana}
<A>__{wheeling and thrusting a black gloved fist into the air. stitched above the breast pocket of his all in one is his first name, "jesus".}
<B>__{back to walter and the dude}
<A>__{they have been joined by donny.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{anyway. how much they offer you?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{twenty grand. and of course i still keep the rug.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{just for making the hand off?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{...they gave dude a beeper, so whenever these guys call }
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what if it's during a game?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i told him if it was during league play }
<A>__{donny has been watching quintana.}
<C>__{donny}
<D>__{if what's during league play?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.}
<C>__{donny}
<D>__{what's wrong with walter, dude?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless. i mean she probably kidnapped herself.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{donny}
<D>__{what do you mean, dude?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{rug peers did not do this. i mean look at it. young trophy wife. marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough. she owes money all over town }

<C>__{dude}
<D>__{yeah, well, what do you care, walter?}
<C>__{donny}
<D>__{yeah dude, why is walter so pissed off?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{those rich fucks! this whole fucking thing i did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet }
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i don't see any connection to vietnam, walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{well, there isn't a literal connection, dude.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{walter, face it, there isn't any connection. it's your roll.}

<D>__{the fucking point is }
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{it's your roll.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{are you ready to be fucked, man?}
<A>__{they both look up. quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of the lanes. over his polyester all in one he now wears a windbreaker with a racing stripe and "jesus" stitched on the breast. he is holding a fancy black and red leather ball satchel (perhaps a sylvia wein). behind him stands his partner, o'brien, a short fat irishman with tufted red hair.}
<C>__{quintana}
<D>__{i see you rolled your way into the semis. deos mio, man. seamus and me, we're gonna fuck you up.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{yeah well, that's just, ya know, like, your opinion, man.}
<A>__{quintana looks at walter.}
<C>__{quintana}
<D>__{let me tell you something, bendeco. you pull any your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, i will take it away from you and stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger til it goes "click".}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{quintana}
<D>__{you said it, man. nobody fucks with the jesus.}
<A>__{jesus walks away. walter nods sadly.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{eight year olds, dude.}
<A>__{dude's bungalow we are looking down at the dude who is prone on the rug. his eyes are closed. he wears a walkman headset. leaking tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an intermittent clatter. in his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled venice beach league playoffs 1987. the dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall rumbling down the lane. on its impact with the pins, the dude opens his eyes. he screams. a blonde woman looms over him. next to her a young man in paint spattered denims stoops and swings something towards the carrier. the sap catches the dude on the chin and sends his head thunking back onto the rug. a million stars explode against a field of black. we hear the "la la la la" of the man in me. the black field dissolves into the pattern of the rug. the rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of the city of los angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed. the dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his bowling shirt. he looks up. ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet. she is outpacing us, growing smaller. the dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand. his bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. he is falling. from a high angle we see the dude hurtling down toward the city, dragged by the ball. a reverse looking up shows the dude hurtling toward us out of the inky sky, his eyes wide with horror. led by the bowling ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in black. we hear a distant rumble, like thunder. dull reflections materialize in the darkness. they are glints off the shiny surface of an oncoming bowling ball. we pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being regurgitated up at us, overtaking us. the dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass rolling a huge shadow across his face. the gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward us finger holes. the largest thumb hole rolls directly over us, engulfing us once again in black.. the black rolls away and we are spinning spinning down a bowling lane our point of view that of someone trapped in the thumbhole of the rolling ball. we see the receding bowler spinning away. it is the blonde woman, performing her follow through. floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor; ceiling; approaching pins; again and again. we hit the pins and clatter into blackness. we hear pins spin, hit each other and drop. we hear an irritating, insistent beeping.}
<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{we are close on the dude, upside down. as the picture fades in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and fainterior they come from the dude's walkman, the headset of which is now askew, with one arm off his ear. as the dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put him right side around. his head is now resting against hardwood floor, not rug.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{oh man.}
<A>__{he raises himself onto his elbows and massages the red lump on his jaw. the beeper on his belt is blinking red in sync with the continuing irritating beeps.}
<B>__{wide on the room}
<A>__{an end table is upset, but otherwise the furniture is in place. the rug is gone. the dude looks around. the bowling sounds continue. the beeps continue. the phone starts to jangle.}
<B>__{track}
<A>__{we push brandt down the familiar marble hallway. again there is a distant aria. brandt throws out a wrist to look at his watch.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{they called about eighty minutes ago. they want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5. they'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. one person only or i'd go with you. they were very clear on that: one person only. what happened to your jaw?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{oh, nothin', you know.}
<A>__{they have reached the little desk outside of the big lebowski's office; brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key and takes out an attache case. he hands this to the dude along with a cellular phone in a battery pack carrying case.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{here's the money, and the phone. please, dude, follow whatever instructions they give.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{her life is in your hands.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{oh, man, don't say that..}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{mr. lebowski asked me to repeat that: her life is in your hands.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{her life is in your hands, dude. and report back to us as soon as it's done.}
<A>__{dude's car we pan off the dude, driving, to his point of view through the front windshield. the headlights play over walter standing waiting in front of the storefront of sobchak security. though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look oddly like a commuter. he also holds an irregular shape bundled in brown wrapping paper. the car stops in front of him and he opens the dude's door and hands in the briefcase.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{take the ringer. i will drive.}
<A>__{the dude takes the briefcase and slides over.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{the what?}

<C>__{dude}
<D>__{walter what the fuck are you thinking?}

<D>__{well you're right, dude, i got to thinking. i got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand }
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{we? what the fuck we? you said you just wanted to come along }
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{my point, dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million. am i wrong?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{yes you're wrong. this isn't a fucking game, walter }
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{it is a fucking game. you said so yourself, dude she kidnapped herself }

<D>__{okay, dude. no time to argue. here's the bridge }
<A>__{there is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge. the dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from the back seat. walter reaches one arm across dude's body to grab the laundry. and there goes the ringer. he flings it out the window.}

<C>__{dude}
<D>__{we have it! we have it!!}
<A>__{there is a distant engine roar. a motorcycle bumps up onto the road from the ravine under the bridge and, tires squealing, skids around to speed away in the opposite direction. it is closely followed by two more roaring motorcycles.}

<A>__{dude's living room the dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses. facing him on the couch are two uniformed policeman, one middle aged, the other a fresh faced rookie. at the cut the portable phone, in the dude's lap, is chirping. the dude waits for the rings to end. when they do:}

<A>__{we are moving through the open living area of a large downtown l.a. loft. a huge unfinished canvas, lit by standing industrial lights, dominates one wall. the furnishings are spare given the space. on the floor is the dude's brilliant rug. we hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball. the dude, standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky depths of the cavernous space. something huge and white hurtles towards the dude's head. as it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass. we see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the floor. she is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas. the dude turns again as he hears running footsteps. two young men in paint spattered shorts, t shirts and sneakers reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track and haul it back for another push.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i will be with you in a minute, mr. lebowski.}
<A>__{she rumbles by in another pass. all right, we'll do the blue tomorrow. elfranco. pedro. help me down. the two men help maude out of her sling. she is naked except for leather harness straps which ring her breasts and wrap her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix look. does the female form make you uncomfor table, mr. lebowski?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{is that what that's a picture of?}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{in a sense, yes. elfranco, my robe. my art has been commended as being strongly vaginal. which bothers some men. the word itself makes some men uncomfortable. vagina.}

<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say. whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "johnson".}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{"johnson"?}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{this to elfranco, who has handed her a robe. all right, mr. lebowski, let's get down to cases. my father told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give. now. as for this. . . "kidnapping" }
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{yes, i know about it. and i know that you acted as courier. and let me tell you something: the whole thing stinks to high heaven.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{right, but let me explain something about that rug }
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{do you like sex, mr. lebowski?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{sex. the physical act of love. coitus. do you like it?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i was talking about my rug.}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{you're not interested in sex?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{you mean coitus?}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{i like it too. it's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. it can be a natural, zesty enterprise. but unfortunately there are some people it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women who engage in it compulsively and without joy.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{oh, no.}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{yes mr. lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word. our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these.}

<D>__{listen, maude, i'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but i don't see what it has to do with do you have any kalhua?}

<D>__{shit yeah, the achievers.}
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{little lebowski urban achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. i asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but i tell you it is preposterous. this compulsive}

<C>__{dude}
<D>__{yeah, but my }
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{i'm getting to your rug. my father and i don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, i don't approve of his. still, i hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so i'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{well sure, i could do that }
<C>__{maude}
<D>__{if you successfully do so, i will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.}

<D>__{ your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. and i am sorry about that crack on the jaw.}

<B>__{gutterballs}
<A>__{the title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked by a pair of bowling balls. the bending bass sound turns into the lead in to kenny rogers and the first edition's "just dropped in." the dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable repairman. the dude's face is washed with a brilliant light as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley. in the center of the alley stands maude lebowski, singing operatic harmony to the kenny rogers song. she wears an armored breastplate and norse headgear, has braided pigtails, and holds a trident. the dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps her with her follow through as she releases a bowling ball. the lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini skirts, their arms akimbo, busby berkley style, their legs turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the end. but it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their legs it is the dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, the tools from his utility belt swinging free. he is face down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides. his point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little ball guide arrows zipping by. the dude twists his body around, performing a barrel roll so that he is now gliding along the lane face up. now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing chorines. the dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so that he is once again gliding face down. he looks forward and his forward momentum blows back his hair. coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, are the approaching pins. we hit the pins, scattering them, and rush on into black. a body drops down into the blackness in slow motion a topless woman, squealing, her legs kicking. as she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool of light. it is the germans, advancing ominously, wielding oversized shears which they menacingly scissor. the dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the advancing germans. he turns and runs, fists pumping. the scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of car bys. the field of black is punctured by headlights. the dude is running blearily down the middle of the pacific coast highway. cars rush by on either side, horns blaring. with the bloo whup of a short siren blast, a squad car with flashing gumballs pulls up.}

<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i wasn't listening.}

<A>__{the dude steps out to meet walter's car as it pulls up, its passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and yapping. denny's four people sit at a booth: dieter, kieffer, franz, all in black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless tee shirt, worn thin with age. she is apparently braless, and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and arms. notable is her camera side leg, which ends in a bandage swaddled foot. dried rust colored blood stains the tip of the bandage. the four are arguing, loudly, in german. they seem very unhappy. a waitress enters with a checkpad and pen.}
