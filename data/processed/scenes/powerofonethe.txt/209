<A>__{pk stands at the bottom of the crystal slab almost dreading what he will find. he resolutely climbs the stalagmites to reach the top. pk's eye level shifts from below the slab to even with it, then to above it. as his sight rises doc's corpse comes into view laid out, serene hands clasped on his chest. from above the stalactites drip onto his body ever so slowly, turning him, molecule by molecule, into crystal. pk stands off to one side.}

<A>__{pk picks it up and opens it. inside is a letter. pk unfolds it, and with trembling hands reads:}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{so mr. schmartypants. it did not take you so long to figure out what happened. i hope you forgive me for not saying goodbye, but i did not think it would be necessary between us. what could i say you don't already know. doc (v.o.) (cont'd) that i love you with all my heart? that you have given me more in our ten years of friendship than three lifetimes could fill? that the last thoughts i have before becoming something else will be of music, cactus, and you? you know all this.}
<A>__{pk turns the sheet to page two which is a whole side of music.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{last night this music came into my head. it is my music for africa. my music for you. so go. be welterweight champion of the world. be a writer. a great writer. remember the only thing between a dream and a reality is you. until we meet again, your friend, doc.}
