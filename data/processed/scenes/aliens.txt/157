<L>__{interior operations}
<A>__{hudson joins ripley and hicks, who are laying out their armament. flamethrowers. grenades. m 41a magazines. hudson's tracker beeps. then again. the tone continues through the scene, its rhythm increasing.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{movement! signal's clean.}
<A>__{he pans the scanner. stops. the range display reads out, counting down.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{range twenty meters.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(to vasquez)}
<D>__{seal the door.}
<A>__{vasquez picks up a hand welder and moves to comply.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{seventeen meters.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{let's get these things lit.}
<A>__{he hands one flamethrower to ripley and begins priming the other himself. it lights with a muffled pop. ripley's lights a moment later. sparks shower around vasquez as she begins welding the door. hudson's tracker is beeping like mad now, as fast as their hearts.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{they learned. they cut the power and avoided the guns. they must have found another way in, something we missed.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{we didn't miss anything.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{fifteen meters.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i don't know, an acid hole in a duct. something under the floors, not on the plans. i don't know!}
<A>__{she picks up vasquez' scanner and aims it the same direction as hudson's.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{twelve meters. man, this is a big fucking signal. ten meters.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{they're right on us. vasquez, how you doing?}
<A>__{vasquez is heedlessly showering herself with molten metal as she welds the door shut. working like a demon.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{nine meters. eight.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{can't be. that's inside the room!}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{it's readin' right. look!}
<A>__{ripley fiddles with her tracker, adjusting the tuning.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{well you're not reading it right!}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{six meters. five. what the fu }
<A>__{he looks at ripley. it dawns on both of them at the same time. she feels a cold premonitory dread as she angles her tracker upward to the ceiling, almost overhead. the tone gets louder. hicks climbs onto a file cabinet and raises a panel of acoustic drop ceiling. he shines his light inside. hicks' p.o.v. a soul wrenching nightmare image. moving in the beam of light are aliens. lots of aliens. they are crawling like bats, upside down, clinging to the pipes and beams of the structural ceiling, not touching the flimsy acoustic panels. they glisten hideously as they claw their way forward in silence. they cover the ceiling of the operations room. the inner sanctum is utterly violated.}
<B>__{on hicks}
<A>__{blasted by fear. something moves...he snaps the light around. it's a meter behind him. it lunges! he drops reflexively, the claws raking across his armor. hicks falls into the room just as the creatures detach en masse from the handholds. the ceiling explodes, raining debris. nightmare shapes drop into the room. newt screams. hudson opens fire. vasquez grabs hicks, pulls him up, firing one handed with her flamethrower. ripley scoops up newt and staggers back. gorman turns to fire and burke bolts for the only remaining exit, the corridor connecting to the med lab. in the strobelike glare of the pulse rifles we see flashes of aliens, moving forward in the smoke from the flamethrower fires. they move like nothing human... leaping quick as insects at times or gliding with powerful, balletic grace.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{medical! get to medical!}
<A>__{she dashes for the corridor.}
