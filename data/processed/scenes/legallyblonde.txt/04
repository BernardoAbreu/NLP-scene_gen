<A>__{serena and margot watch as elle stands in front of a mirror, trying on a herve leger white mini dress. sexy and ultra tight.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{too demure?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i think you should go with red. it's the color of confidence.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{well, i don't want to look like i know what's coming.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{i don't understand why you're completely disregarding your signature color.}
<A>__{she holds up a tiny pink slipdress.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{he's proposing! i can't look like i would on any date. this is the date. the night i will always remember. i want to look special. bridal . . . but not like i suspect anything.}
<B>__{across the store}
<A>__{a saleswoman looks at her cohort.}
<C>__{saleswoman}
<P>__{(sot.to)}
<D>__{there ' s nothing i love more than a dumb blonde with daddy's plastic.}
<A>__{she grabs a dress off the clearance sale rack, ripping off the "half price" tag.}
<B>__{on elle and the girls}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{i can't wait to see you wearing the rock!}
<A>__{elle looks at them, suddenly concerned.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{what if — you know — it's not the night?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{why else would he be taking you to the ivy? you've been dating for a year — it's not like he's trying to impress you.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{elle, you've heard the man pass gas in his sleep. that practically means you're pre engaged. '"}
<A>__{the saleswoman approaches with the dress, kiss assy smile on her face.}
<C>__{saleswoman}
<D>__{did you see this one? we just got it in yesterday.}
<A>__{elle fingers the dress, then the new price tag, looking back at the saleswoman, excited.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{is this a low viscosity rayon?}
<C>__{saleswoman}
<D>__{uh, yes — of course.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{with half loop top stitching on the hem?}
<C>__{saleswoman}
<P>__{(smiling a lie)}
<D>__{absolutely. it's one of a kind.}
<A>__{elle hands the dress back to her, no longer pretending to be excited.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{it's impossible to use a half loop topstitch on low viscosity rayon. it would snag the fabric. and you didn't just get this in, because i remember it from the june vogue a year ago, so if you're trying to sell it to me at full price, you picked the wrong girl.}
<A>__{the saleswoman slinks off, embarrassed.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(to the saleswoman)}
<D>__{nice try...}
<A>__{elle shakes her head and turns back to the girls as she slips on her manolo blahnik sandals, doing one last mirror check, smoothing down her golden mane.}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(dramatically)}
<D>__{girls, this is it. in a few hours, i will be the future mrs. warner huntington iii.}
