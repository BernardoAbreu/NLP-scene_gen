<L>__{exterior cave home day}
<A>__{young masbath, waiting by the horses, looks up. through the trees, black clouds billow and block the sun.}
<L>__{interior cave home, lower cave day}
<A>__{the old crone slumps, still with her back to ichabod. she does not move. wind howls through a hole window. rain. candles blow out. ichabod stands, worried.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{excuse me... um...}
<A>__{she remains motionless. the storm outside intensifies. we see the skin of the crone's wrists transform; swelling in the cuffs, hardening, cracking and bleeding. some thing ichabod cannot see. he inches closer.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{are you alright... ?}
<A>__{the crone turns, hideous, leaping erect a half human, half demon creature. its black clawed hands reaching. ichabod recoils, crying out. chains on restraining cuffs yank the creature back. ichabod hits the floor, knocking over a table of bones. the creature is chained, but still wants ichabod. it screeches. the old crone's face seethes from transformation, eyes blood red, nostrils dripping, teeth now jagged.}
<D>__{creature old crone you seek the warrior bathed in blood... the headless horseman.}
<A>__{ichabod slides back as far as possible while the creature claws the rock floor, yearning.}
<D>__{creature old crone follow the indian trail to where the sun dies. follow to the tree of the dead.}
<A>__{the creature pulls, testing the chains. behind, the bolt holding the chains to the wall slips. the wall cracks.}
<D>__{creature old crone climb down to the horseman's soulless place and let loose his silent shrieking. do you hear? do you hear?!}
<A>__{ichabod nods, quaking, aghast. he glances to the exit. the chain bolt gives more... coming loose...}
<D>__{creature old crone he who holds fast the horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand. catch hold of his desire.}
<A>__{ichabod bolts for the door. the creature howls, leaping... the chain bolt breaks... ichabod cries out, tackled to the floor... it is the old crone who landed on him. she has returned to human form, semi conscious. ichabod shoves her off.}
