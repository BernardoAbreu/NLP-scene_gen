<A>__{sweeney todd and mrs. lovett are moving quickly, she struggles to keep up with his long, loping stride. he carries his razor case, she carries a shopping basket.}

<D>__{he's here every thursday?}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{like clockwork. eyetalian. all the rage he is.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{not for long.}
<L>__{exterior st. dunstan's marketplace day}
<A>__{they round a corner and move into the bustling marketplace. a steady mercantile hum as the cries of merchants and wandering coster mongers fill the air. todd and mrs. lovett move toward a hand drawn caravan dominating one corner of the marketplace. it is painted like a sicilian donkey cart and on its side a sign declaims: "signor adolfo pirelli haircutter to his royal majesty the king of naples."}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{oh mr. t., do you really think you can do it?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{by tomorrow they'll all be flocking to me like sheep to be shorn }
<A>__{he stops abruptly when he sees the beadle casually strolling through the crowd. todd is transfixed, his ancient enemy so close.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<P>__{(seeing the beadle, pulling his arm)}
<D>__{come along now, dear, he might recognize you }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i will do what i have vowed to do ...}
<P>__{(he continues to glare at}
<D>__{the beadle, his voice}
<P>__{low)}
<D>__{... come closer, my friend, closer...}
<A>__{then, toby a 13 year old boy, a bit small for his age, malnourished and consumptively pale emerges from pirelli's caravan. he bangs on a tin drum, drawing customers. a crowd begins to gather at the caravan as:}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen! may i have your attention, perlease? do you wake every morning in shame and despair to discover your pillow is covered with hair wot ought not to be there? well, ladies and gentlemen, from now on you can waken at ease. you need never again have a worry or care, i will show you a miracle marvelous rare, gentlemen, you are about to see something wot rose from the dead!}
<P>__{(a woman gasps, he smiles and wiggles a finger no)}
<D>__{on the top of my head.}
<A>__{he dramatically doffs his cap, revealing mountains of hair which cascade to his shoulder.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{'twas pirelli's miracle elixir, that's wot did the trick, sir, true, sir, true. was it quick, sir? did it in a tick, sir? just like an elixir ought to do!}
<P>__{(to a bald man)}
<D>__{how about a bottle, mister? only costs a penny, guaranteed.}
<P>__{(pours a drop on the bald man's head)}
<D>__{does pirelli's stimulate the growth, sir? you can have my oath, sir, 'tis unique.}
<P>__{(applies the bald man's hand to the wet spot)}
<D>__{rub a minute, stimulatin', i'n it? soon you'll have to thin it once a week!}
<A>__{more customers are stepping up and buying bottles. todd opens a bottle of the elixir, takes a whiff. disgusting. he smiles to mrs. lovett, his plan falling into place.}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(loudly, to mrs. lovett)}
<D>__{pardon me, ma'am, what's that awful stench?}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{are we standing near an open trench?}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(to a woman in the crowd)}
<D>__{must be standing near an open trench!}
<A>__{the crowd responds to todd and mrs. lovett, looking askance and sniffing at the bottles. toby nervously tries to distract them:}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{buy pirelli's miracle elixir: anything wot's slick, sir, soon sprouts curls. try pirelli's! when they see how thick, sir, you can have your pick, sir, of the girls! want to buy a bottle, missus?}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(sniffing bottle of elixir)}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<P>__{(sniffing another customer's bottle)}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{smells like piss.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{smells like phew!}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{this is piss. piss with ink.}
<A>__{the music speeds up toby is getting desperate:}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{let pirelli's activate your roots, sir }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{keep it off your boots, sir eats right through.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yes, get pirelli's! use a bottle of it! ladies seem to love it }
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{flies do too!}
<A>__{suddenly, the curtains on the caravan are dramatically flung wide to reveal pirelli, a flamboyant italian with a velvet suit, thick wavy hair and a dazzling smile. pirelli poses splendidly for a moment. then:}
<C>__{pirelli}
<D>__{i am adolfo pirelli, da king of da barbers, da barber of kings, e buon giorno, good day, i blow you a kiss!}
<P>__{(he does so)}
<D>__{and i, da so famous pirelli, i wish a to know a who has a da nerve a to say my elixir is piss! who says this?!}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i do.}
<P>__{(todd moves forward boldly.)}
<D>__{i am mr. sweeney todd of fleet street. i have opened a bottle of pirelli's elixir, and i say to you that it is nothing but an arrant fraud, concocted from piss and ink.}
<A>__{the crowd gasps. pirelli is about to respond, outraged, but todd continues }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{and furthermore "signor" i have serviced no kings, yet i wager i can shave a cheek with ten times more dexterity that any street mountebank.}
<A>__{he snaps open his razor case and holds it up for the crowd to see, turning to display the wondrous razors:}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you see these razors?}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<P>__{(to the crowd)}
<D>__{the finest in england.}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(glaring at pirelli)}
<D>__{i lay them against five pounds you are no match for me. you hear me, sir? either accept my challenge or reveal yourself as a sham.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{bravo, bravo.}
<A>__{the crowd is enjoying this now, whispering eagerly about the bold challenge. in the crowd, we see a quick flash of the meek tourist we saw earlier. pirelli studies the razors for a moment and then turns to the crowd with a confident smile:}
<C>__{pirelli}
<D>__{you hear zis foolish man? watch and see how he will regret his folly!}
<A>__{music begins as todd moves into action, preparing the challenge:}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{friends, who's for a free shave?}
<A>__{two men step forward. a plain wooden chair is brought for todd as he moves into the boldest part of this plan... he carefully turns to ... the beadle.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{will beadle bamford be the judge?}
<A>__{mrs. lovett's eyes shoot to todd, alarmed the beadle moves toward todd .... todd smiles amiably, but quivers internally at being so dreadfully close to his prey... mrs. lovett watches, concerned. will the beadle recognize the features of benjamin barker...? apparently not. the beadle stops right before todd and smiles.}
<C>__{beadle}
<D>__{glad, as always, to oblige my friends and neighbors}
<P>__{(to the crowd)}
<D>__{... let the challenge commence!}
<A>__{one man sits in todd's plain chair as the other moves to an elaborate chair on pirelli's caravan. pirelli shakes out a fancy bib with a flourish and covers his man. toby prepares pirelli's ornate shaving supplies as todd takes a plain towel and tucks it around his man's neck.}
<C>__{beadle}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{pirelli}
<D>__{ready!}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{ready.}
<C>__{beadle}
<D>__{the fastest, smoothest shave is the winner.}
<A>__{he blows his shrill whistle. agitated music begins. pirelli strops his razor quickly, todd in a leisurely manner. pirelli keeps glancing at todd in various paranoid ways throughout, frightened of todd's progress. he starts whipping up lather rapidly:}
<C>__{pirelli}
<P>__{(while mixing furiously)}
<D>__{now, signorini, signori, we mix a da lather but first a you gather around, signorini, signori, you looking a man who have had a da glory to shave a da pope. mr. sweeney so smart }
<P>__{(splatters the customer with shaving cream)}
<D>__{oh, i beg a you pardon 'll call me a lie, was a only a cardinal nope! it was a da pope!}
<A>__{unexpectedly, todd still shows no signs of starting to shave his man. he merely watches pirelli's performance. mrs. lovett looks at him nervously, wishing he would get on with it. pirelli, now feeling he can take his time, sings lyrically as he lathers and shaves with rhythmic scrapes and elaborate gestures of wiping the razor.}
<C>__{pirelli}
<D>__{to shave a da face, to cut a da hair, require da grace require da flair, for if a you slip, you nick da skin, you clip a da chin, you rip a da lip a bit beyond a repair!}
<A>__{todd strops his razor slowly and deliberately shoop, shoop, shoop disconcerting pirelli and drawing the crowd's attention.}
<C>__{pirelli}
<D>__{to shave a da face or even a part widout it a smart require da heart. not just a da flash, it take a panache, it take a da passion for da art.}
<A>__{todd is unconcerned. he just continues to slowly strop his razor shoop, shoop, shoop which flusters pirelli.}
<C>__{pirelli}
<D>__{to shave a da face, to trim a da beard, to make a da bristle clean like a whistle, dis is from early infancy da talent give to me by god!}
<P>__{(crosses himself with his razor)}
<D>__{it take a da skill, it take a da brains, it take a da will to take a da pains, it take a da pace, it take a da graaaaaace...}
<A>__{while pirelli holds this note elaborately, todd, with a few deft strokes, quickly lathers his man's face, shaves him and signals the beadle to examine him.}
<C>__{beadle}
<P>__{(blowing whistle)}
<D>__{the winner is todd.}
<A>__{pirelli deflates.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<P>__{(feeling the customer's cheek)}
<D>__{smooth as a baby's arse! (to todd) well done, dear!}
<A>__{the crowd laughs and applauds todd as pirelli goes to him:}
<C>__{pirelli}
<P>__{(a profound bow)}
<D>__{sir, i bow to a skill far defter than my own.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{the five pounds.}
<A>__{pirelli produces a distinctive chatelaine purse and removes a five pound note, gives it to todd:}
<C>__{pirelli}
<D>__{here, sir. and may the good lord smile on you }
<P>__{(a quick stab of a smile)}
<D>__{ until we meet again.}
<A>__{he bows his head quickly and then moves away, beckoning to toby:}
<C>__{pirelli}
<D>__{come, boy.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{we're pulling out, sir?}
<A>__{without warning, pirelli slaps toby viciously across the face toby almost falls }
<C>__{pirelli}
<P>__{(snarling)}
<D>__{we're pulling out, yes. quickly.}
<A>__{mrs. lovett has observed all of this as she moves away with todd, who is making his way inexorably toward the beadle. some eager customers surround todd, among them is the}

<C>__{eager customer}
<D>__{mr. todd, sir, do you have an establishment of your own?}
<A>__{mrs. lovett is on him like a hawk:}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{he certainly does. sweeney todd's tonsorial parlor above my meatpie emporium in fleet street.}
<A>__{todd has led them right to the beadle:}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i thank you for your honest adjudication, sir. you are a paragon of integrity.}
<C>__{beadle}
<D>__{well, i try to do my best for my friends and neighbors ... your establishment is in fleet street, you say?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{beadle}
<D>__{then, mr. todd, you will surely see me there before the week is out.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you will be welcome, beadle bamford, and i guarantee to give you, without a penny's charge, the closest shave you will ever know.}
