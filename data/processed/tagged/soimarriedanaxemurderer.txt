<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh, thank god... i thought you were robbing our own home, because frankly, that's insane. i mean, what could you possibly gain by robbing your own home? i don't mean to meddle, but isn't it better to rob other peoples' homes? start accumulating their wealth as opposed to just reaccumulating your own wealth.}

<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{that's like saying we're not the sort of people who are going to grow old. we're not going to fall into that "growing old" trap. face it, you've got a problem with commitment, charlie. take a look at your other girlfriends. every time you get close to a commitment there's something wrong with them.}
