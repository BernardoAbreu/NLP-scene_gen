<A>__{stares at the bodies, now seen to be in the first stages of deterioration, strips of flesh torn away by the birds and other scavengers. in an almost childlike manner, he crosses himself.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(hoarse whisper)}
<D>__{holy mother...}
<A>__{schaefer moves into the clearing, kneeling beside a bloody pile of clothing and entrails. he examines the clothing and then rises, holding a dog tag on a broken chain. he reads the tag, his face growing hardened and bitter as he stares down at the tag, recognizing the name.}

<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{j.s. davis, captain, u.s. army...}
<A>__{schaefer's eyes move from the bloody dog tag to the bodies.}

<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{mac. cut them down.}
<A>__{mac moves forward, withdrawing his combat knife. the blade flashes, cutting the vine as the first body thuds to the ground. he bends over, picking up other dog tags. schaefer turns to dillon.}

<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{well somebody sent them.}
<A>__{schaefer walks off. mac steps out of the clearing, sheathing his knife with a violent gesture, passing ramirez.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(seething)}
<D>__{must have run into the guerrillas ...fucking animals.}
<A>__{mac moves alongside blain.}
<C>__{mac}

<P>__{(looks at blain)}
<D>__{time to let 'ol 'painless' out of the bag.}
