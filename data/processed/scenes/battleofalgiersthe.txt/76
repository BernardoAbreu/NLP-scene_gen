<L>__{75 koran school. inside. day.}
<A>__{a large room, like a shop or stable. here too, on the ground and pavement, there are tufts of grass. it is cold. the walls are unplastered, the windows boarded. the roof is in sight, but not the beams. the roof is made of tiles and covered with a coat of whitewash. there are about twenty children, five to eight years old, seated on the floor. the teacher is in front of them; he too is seated. he is prompting the verses in a low voice, almost in a whisper, and the chorus repeats it. the koran school: a bare, wobbling place. the algerian who has entered takes the child by his hand, and accompanies him to the teacher who is now standing; the chorus continues; the other children, do not look at the two who have just entered. the algerian and the teacher greet each other, bringing their hands to their hearts, and then to their mouths. at the same time, the teacher takes an envelope from under his tunic, and hands it over to the other.}
