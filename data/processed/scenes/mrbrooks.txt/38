<L>__{interior crime lab n afternoon}
<A>__{large and small color photographs pinned to a corkboard create a collage of the dance couple murder scene. standing in front of this is captain lister, a tall slim open faced woman in her mid fifties, and the lead crime scene technician we saw earlier at the murder house.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{it's not what's here, it's what's not here that's interesting. there's not a trace of anything foreign. if i didn't know better i'd say these people were killed by a ghost.}
<C>__{captain lister}
<D>__{the autopsy found a tiny piece of plastic in the female victim's brain.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{we're checking with the ammunition manufacturers.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<P>__{(entering the room)}
<D>__{that's a dead end, he bags the gun.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{he ziplocks a one gallon plastic freezer bag to his wrist over the gun. bang. bang. a little bit of plastic is carried by the first slug, the ejected shells go into the bag and it limits the powder residue.}
<P>__{(to captain lister)}
<D>__{i hear you were looking for me.}
<C>__{captain lister}
<P>__{(to the technician)}
<D>__{sigy...}

<A>__{he's gone.}
<C>__{captain lister}
<D>__{i received a subpoena from your husband's lawyer for your work records, where you were, date and times for the past two years.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{that's blackmail.}
<C>__{captain lister}
<D>__{almost three quarters of your cases are current. i can't let that information go into open court. so until you settle your divorce, i'm going to have to put you on a desk.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{that's also blackmail.}
<C>__{captain lister}
<D>__{that's one of your big problems, atwood, you don't know how to ask for help.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{do you know what he did to me?}
<C>__{captain lister}
<D>__{you can't grow old as a woman without having at least one lousy man in your life.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{i was so stupid. while we were married, while i paid for him to live, the son of a bitch fucked every woman he could get his hands on. he fucked my friends, he even fucked a cousin of mine. everyone knew but me, and they were laughing at me behind my back. he made me look like an idiot. i was a joke.}
<C>__{captain lister}
<D>__{and?...}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{and what?}
<C>__{captain lister}
<D>__{get over it.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{i made him an offer. i'm not going to give him one red cent more.}
<C>__{captain lister}
<D>__{i hear what he's asking for, you could take out of pocket change. do that and go on with your life.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{i couldn't live with myself if i did.}
<C>__{captain lister}
<D>__{i will spread your work among the other guys and the fbi will be here on thursday...}
<P>__{(motions to the pictures)}
<D>__{... they'll take over this case.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{please, these are my cases. nobody knows them like me. don't give them away and don't give the thumbprint killer to the fbi. he's killed people in twelve other states, let them fuck up those investigations. this one's mine.}
<C>__{captain lister}
<P>__{(opening the door to leave)}
<D>__{you heard meeks escaped?}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{captain lister}
