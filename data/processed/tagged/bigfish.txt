<B>__{a river.}
<A>__{we're underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along. this is the beast.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{there are some fish that cannot be caught. it's not that they're faster or stronger than other fish. they're just touched by something extra. call it luck. call it grace. one such fish was the beast.}
<A>__{the beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited with worms. past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun. past a swiping bear claw. the beast isn't worried.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{by the time i was born, he was already a legend. he'd taken more hundred dollar lures than any fish in alabama. some said that fish was the ghost of henry walls, a thief who'd drowned in that river 60 years before. others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, left over from the cretaceous period.}

<A>__{will bloom, age 3, listens wide eyed as his father edward bloom, 40's and handsome, tells the story. in every gesture, edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i didn't put any stock into such speculation or superstition. all i knew was i'd been trying to catch that fish since i was a boy no bigger than you.}
<P>__{(closer)}
<D>__{and on the day you were born, that was the day i finally caught him.}

<C>__{edward}
<D>__{now, i'd tried everything on it: worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut butter and cheese. but on that day i had a revelation: if that fish was the ghost of a thief, the usual bait wasn't going to work. i would have to use something he truly desired.}

<A>__{while the other boys are rapt with attention, will looks bored. he's heard this story before.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i tied my ring to the strongest line they made strong enough to hold up a bridge, they said, if just for a few minutes and i cast upriver.}
<L>__{interior bloom front hall night (1987)}
<A>__{edward is chatting up will's pretty date to the homecoming dance. she is enjoying the story, but also the force of edward's charisma. he's hypnotizing.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{the beast jumped up and grabbed it before the ring even hit the water. and just as fast, he snapped clean through that line.}
<A>__{will, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. his mother sandra from whom he gets his good looks and practicality stands with him at the door.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you can see my predicament. my wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.}

<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i followed that fish up river and down river for three days and three nights, until i finally had him boxed in.}
<A>__{will regards his father with exasperated contempt.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{with these two hands, i reached in and snatched that fish out of the river. i looked him straight in the eye. and i made a remarkable discovery.}

<A>__{will, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride josephine. this is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and family. they should be joyful, but will is furious. edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast. the room is cozy and drunk.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{this fish, the beast. the whole time we were calling it a him, when in fact it was a her. it was fat with eggs, and was going to lay them any day.}
<A>__{over near the doorway, we spot sandra, just returned from the restrooms. she looks gorgeous. she couldn't be any happier if this were her own wedding.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{now, i was in a situation. i could gut that fish and get my ring back, but doing so i would be killing the smartest catfish in the ashton river, soon to be mother of a hundred others.}
<A>__{will can't take any more. josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves. edward doesn't even notice.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{did i want to deprive my soon to be born son the chance to catch a fish like this of his own? this lady fish and i, well, we had the same destiny.}
<A>__{as he leaves, will mutters in perfect unison with his father }
<C>__{edward and will}
<D>__{we were part of the same equation.}
<A>__{will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{honey, it's still your night.}
<A>__{will can't articulate his anger. he just leaves.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{now, you may well ask, since this lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief, why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it?}
<P>__{(closer; he holds up his ring)}
<D>__{that was the lesson i learned that day, the day my son was born.}
<A>__{he focuses his words on sandra. this story is and has always been about her more than anyone.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{sometimes, the only way to catch an uncatchable woman is to offer her a wedding ring.}
<A>__{a laugh from the crowd. edward motions for sandra to get up here with him. as she crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not lessened their affection for each other. as they kiss, edward tweaks her chin a special little way. the crowd applauds. edward toasts the happy couple. josephine covers well for her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer. edward downs his champagne in a gulp.}

<A>__{we come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk. occasional passersby take notice, especially as it gets more heated. both men are a little drunk.}

<D>__{you're embarrassing yourself, dad. you just don't see it.}
<A>__{angle on edward. fine. a hand to wave, enough of you. he walks away. angle on will, still fuming with righteous anger. it's then we freeze frame.}

<A>__{edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{in telling the story of my father's life, it's impossible to separate the fact from the fiction, the man from the myth. the best i can do is to tell it the way he told me.}
<A>__{we look down at the river, where edward's reflection is caught in the dark water. as the water ripples past, something changes. sure enough, as we look up again, it's a younger edward bloom,}
<L>__{20's, staring into the water. he's not just handsome, not}
<A>__{just charming. it's as if all the forces of the natural world had conspired to create him.}

<A>__{suddenly, we hear a pop as a slimy mass of human being rockets into the doctor's unprepared hands. bennett tries to hold tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish. it shoots up into air. the nurses and the husband try to grab the baby, but no one can hold it. as the newborn sails upward towards camera, we can see a giggling smile on its face. as it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides it a ramp to slide right out of the room. everyone races after it.}

<A>__{we pull back, and back, revealing more of the gothically creepy house: its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie gargoyles half buried in the dirt. even bats are afraid to fly over it. in the moonlight, the house is especially sinister. who knows what is lurking in the shadows?}
<C>__{adult edward }
<D>__{yet of the all the witches in alabama, there was one who was the most feared. for she had one glass eye, which was said to contain mystical powers.}

<A>__{by the light of the full moon, edward soaks his feet in the water, trying to make sense of it all. the key to the city dangles around his neck. he stares at himself in the reflection. he smiles. it's then that a woman emerges at the far side of the river. no telling where she came from she must have been swimming underwater. we never see her face. she stands in the river with her bare back to edward, squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his presence. edward is breathless. it's the first woman he's seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he frighten her away. then he sees the snake. it's a cottonmouth, has to be. it leaves a break in the water, its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh. there's no decision to be made. on pure instinct, edward dives in. he swims as hard as can,}

<L>__{exterior the dark forest night}
<A>__{various shots: edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet. it's horrible. almost unendurable. and then it gets worse. the trees ahead are moving. at first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood cracking and groaning, there's no mistaking it: they're trying to block him. snake like white roots shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles. he leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one's branches. he swings off, lands and rolls. now all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes towering over him in the flashes of lightning.}

<A>__{as he ducks under branches, the chain holding the key to the city gets caught. he's almost strangled, but the chain finally breaks. the silver key disappears into the mud. scrambling forward, he looks for a way out. but the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him. he screams up at the night, until his breath is gone.}

<D>__{that's terrible.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "your grampa is going to die." well, i ran right back to my parents. my father said, no, gramps is fine, but i could see there was trepidation. and true enough, that next morning my grampa was dead.}

<D>__{well, i didn't know what to do. but finally i told my father. and he said not to worry, but i could tell he was rattled. that next day, he wasn't himself, always looking around, waiting for something to drop on his head. because the crow didn't tell how it was going to happen, just those words: your daddy is going to die. well, he went into town early and was gone for a long time. and when he finally came back, he looked terrible, like he was waiting for the axe to fall all day. he said to my mother, "good god. i just had the worst day of my life."}

<A>__{will heads for the bathroom. sure enough, the wheelchair is there.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{hurry! we don't have much time.}
<L>__{interior hospital hallway day}
<A>__{with the blanket draped over his head like a ghost, edward points for his son to steer the wheelchair thataway.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{faster!}
<A>__{they pass a heavyset nurse, who turns to look. rounding a corner, they nearly crash into dr. bennett.}
<C>__{dr. bennett}
<D>__{will! i... what are you doing?}
<A>__{before he can answer, will spots edward rolling the chair himself, pumping both arms. will dashes to catch up with him. the heavyset nurse leans out of edward's hospital room.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{security! stop them!}
<B>__{down the hall}
<A>__{at the elevators, sandra and josephine step out to find will and edward barreling straight at them.}

<A>__{will sets him in the passenger seat.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{water. i need water.}
<A>__{scrambling in back, will finds a liter of arrowhead. hands it off. edward unscrews the cap, but instead of drinking it, he douses himself. soaks the blanket. will pops the trunk. starts to fold up the wheelchair.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{leave it! we won't need it.}
<A>__{tires smoke as the car peals out.}

<L>__{interior hospital room day [reality]}

<C>__{will}
<D>__{and we have to take glenville to avoid all the church traffic, because those damn church people drive too slow.}
<A>__{tight on edward, enjoying that detail. he's focused completely on will's story.}

<C>__{edward}
<D>__{the river!}
<A>__{will stops short, the traffic backed up. he honks, trying to get around the jam. but it's no use. then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive hands. it's karl the giant, clearing a path by brute force. edward leans out the window and waves. karl waves back.}
<L>__{exterior ashton river day}
<A>__{the same stretch of the river where it all began. a crowd of more than 100 waiting.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{as we get closer to the river, we see everybody's already there. and i mean everybody.}
<A>__{amos calloway is here with the circus folk, including mr. soggybottom. we also find edward's mother and father, the mayor, and many others from along the way. no one has aged a day since we saw them last. while ping scans the horizon, jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, norther winslow. it's ping who first spots the chevrolet.}
<C>__{ping}
<D>__{he's here!}
<A>__{the crowd cheers. the ashton marching band plays. jenny hill smiles. so does the old woman. we push in on the old woman's glass eye, where we see...}

<D>__{it's unbelievable.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{story of my life.}
<L>__{exterior riverside day}
<A>__{will gets out of the chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd. behind him, sandra, josephine and dr. bennett pull up. karl comes just after that. crossing to the passenger side, will lifts his father out. strangely, he's gotten even lighter. will carries him easily. edward pulls off his shoes, tying the laces together. he hands them to josephine. she throws them up at the powerline. they loop over. applause and cheers. the crowd parts to let will and edward get to the river. as he passes, edward shakes some hands, pats some people on the cheek, and gives others a good poke in the ribs.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{and the strange thing is, there's not a sad face to be found. everyone's just so glad to see you, and send you off right.}
<A>__{will walks into the river, up to his knees. he turns back so his father can face the crowd. edward waves.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{goodbye everybody! farewell! adieu!}
<C>__{the crowd }
<D>__{goodbye edward! see ya! we'll miss you!}
<A>__{but one face is missing from the crowd sandra. will turns to see she's already standing in the river beside them. the reflection of the light off the water gives sandra an unearthly glow. she's more tranquil and more beautiful than we've ever seen her.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{my girl in the river.}
<A>__{she kisses him. he tweaks her chin. the crowd hollers in approval, but their moment remains strangely private. only will is there to witness. as the kiss ends, edward tries to pull off his wedding ring. but it's stuck. finally, he sucks on it, pulling it free with his teeth. a look to will, a smile with a glint of gold. will takes the ring out of his mouth. edward suddenly drops out of will's arms with a splash. for he's no longer a man, but rather}
<B>__{a fat catfish}
<A>__{swimming at his feet. we watch as the catfish circles, then heads for deeper water, disappearing. will and his mother stand knee deep in the water, watching edward bloom swim away into the sunlight. josephine is back on the shore, along with the entire crowd. music builds to a climax, then... down the river, a giant fish suddenly jumps out of the water, cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset. it then dives back under with a splash.}

<C>__{will}
<D>__{you become what you always were. a very big fish.}

<D>__{and that's the way it happens.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{yes. exactly.}
<A>__{edward smiles, proud of both of them. his eyes are so pale and so open, we can almost see his soul. in every atom of his body, in every thought, edward bloom is entirely happy. and this is how he goes.}
<L>__{interior hospital hallway day}
<A>__{will shuts the door to his father's room behind him. the walk to the payphones seems to take a lifetime. he finds a quarter, starts to dial. he has to squint to see through the water in his eyes. it's ringing. and ringing. the other end answers.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(voice cracking)}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{that's all he can get out before the dam breaks inside him. he presses closer to the phone, trying to shield himself. music begins that will carry us through the next passage.}

<A>__{will and his mother pick out one of edward's ties, for will to wear at the funeral. will tries to button the cuffs on the shirt he borrowed, but they're the kind that need links. he goes through the top drawer of the dresser, trying to find a matching pair. further down, he finds a ribbon tied to}
<B>__{the key to the city.}
<A>__{he smiles, disbelieving. it's a real thing.}
<L>__{exterior cemetery road day}
<A>__{will helps his mother out of a black sedan. she's well composed, not nearly the wreck we might have expected. josephine hugs dr. bennett and shakes hands with his wife. the service is crowded, more than 200 people, many more than expected. as his mother talks to a well wisher, will looks left to see an oldsmobile parking. close on the license plates. missouri. the passenger side opens, but the man who steps out is barely visible over the door. he shuts it to reveal himself to be it's amos calloway. will doesn't recognize him. the driver climbs out, a size 15 foot on the gravel. we tilt up to see this man is huge. this man is karl, now 55. he's not 12 feet tall, but at least six eight. close on will, bewildered to see that this man really exists.}
<L>__{exterior cemetery graveside day}
<A>__{as the service gets ready to begin, will guides his mother to a seat near the grave. sitting beside will, josephine spots a stunning asian woman (50) behind them. a beat later, an identical face with glasses peers out the woman's twin sister. it's ping and jing. josephine almost gasps. she elbows will, who turns to look. from this angle the sisters seem conjoined, but then jing steps forward. they're really two separate people. a sea of familiar faces, all of them aged through the years: beamen, norther winslow, the mayor, and zacky price.}
<L>__{exterior cemetery day [later]}
<A>__{after the service, we see the crowd gathered in small groups. by the laughter and hand gestures, we can see they're telling stories. they're telling edward's stories. we find will watching them.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{have you ever heard a joke so many times you've forgotten why it's funny? but then you hear it again and suddenly it's new. you remember why you loved it in the first place.}
<A>__{will joins in, laughing. we slowly circle behind a monument, letting it black out the screen.}

<D>__{dad, that's right, isn't it?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{son}
<D>__{see. so he was a giant but my grampa was going to fight him because he wasn't afraid of anything because he'd seen how he was going to die in this old lady's glass eye...}
<A>__{will smiles as his son continues the tale, which fades. sandra takes will's hand in hers, just listening.}
