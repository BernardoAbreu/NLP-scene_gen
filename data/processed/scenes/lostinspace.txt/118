<L>__{exterior jupiter two}
<A>__{as the ship moves back in front of the portal, the hole in space is visible again, the giant probe ship revealed once more within...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's a hole in space. a doorway.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{a doorway to where?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{if we want to reach that ship, we're going to have to find out.}
<L>__{exterior space}
<A>__{the jupiter two flies through the pulsing hole in space.}
<L>__{interior jupiter two}
<A>__{the giant, silver ship looms in the windscreen.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{no apparent effects on the ship.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i'm hailing on all frequencies. no response.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{there are some markings on the starboard side. can you throw some light on her?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{don't know if the exterior spots are working. there we go.}
<A>__{the windscreen close. powerful spotlights hit the ship. west and john close. and really surprised.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{if this in all a dream, why can't there be more girls?}
<A>__{the spaceship close. essentially a needle covered with metal scallops. on its hull, under the legend proteus, an american flag.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i've never seen a design like this. what are those scales on her hull?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{how could earth launch a ship this massive and neither of us know about it? ... it just doesn't make sense.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{these scanners are damaged, i'm getting inconsistent life signs but they may be sensor ghosts.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{maybe her computer's still up. i'm trying standard remote access codes.}
<A>__{on screen a docking ring on the giant ship comes to life, giant floods coming to life, the docking aperture rotating open.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{what do you know?}
