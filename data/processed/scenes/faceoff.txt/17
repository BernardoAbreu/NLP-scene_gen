<A>__{freshly dressed, archer heads down the hall. he pauses at the door to jamie's room when he sees jamie. fully clothed, she's fast asleep on her bed cluttered with clothes and assorted girl stuff. her face peaceful. archer looks around her room... sees the stuffed animals collecting dust... replaced by makeup, jewelry, beefcake calvin klein ads and band posters, etc. archer's startled to see a lacey bustier... his little girl is growing up fast. and he's missing it. he pulls the blanket up over her and quietly slips out. the instant he leaves, jamie kicks the blankets off.}
