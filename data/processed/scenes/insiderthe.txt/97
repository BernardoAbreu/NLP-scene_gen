<L>__{interior the kitchen, the wigands' house night}
<A>__{we see out the window a security guard, incongruous, walking by. and we see liane, finished with the dinner dishes, silently wiping off the sink. there's a pall you could cut with a knife. a moment, and jeffrey comes in the kitchen door from the garden... he stops to wash his hands in the sink.}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{please don't wash your hands in the sink.}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{where should i wash them?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{use the bathroom.}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{what's the difference...}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{that's for food.}
<A>__{but he ignores her, washing his hands... and she turns the water off. he turns it back on. he thinks, then turns it off. then she turns it on .}
<C>__{liane }
<D>__{leave it on! just leave it on, okay?!}
<A>__{and she turns and leaves the room, coldly, all her anger repressed. for jeffrey, everything else and now this? the running faucet.}
