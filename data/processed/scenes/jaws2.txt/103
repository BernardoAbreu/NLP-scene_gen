<L>__{exterior ocean day establishing shot}
<A>__{on the way to the lighthouse, but away from the harbor, the kids are sailing in fairly close order: the sloops (polo, timmy, marge) heeled well over in the stiff breeze, the faster cats (mike, larry, donny, etc.) skimming around, tacking more often, faster and more maneuverable.}
<B>__{close on patrick and lucy}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{faster! faster!}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{coming about...}
<A>__{she ducks under the boom, handling the jib sheets with easy familiarity. they come about and scoot off on a new tack.}
<B>__{close on polo}
<A>__{reading the wind, trimming sail expertly, competent and alone.}
<C>__{polo}
<P>__{(to a near by boat)}
<D>__{great day! i think the wind's going to change...}
<B>__{close on timmy and brooke}
<A>__{he comes about, she slides into him, he holds her to steady her, she snuggles into his arms. true love, at last... he's thrilled.}
<B>__{close on doug}
<A>__{in his inflatable, poking slowly along. marge passes him, sean hooting with glee.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{coming up.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{slowpoke! slowpoke! marge is faster!}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i'm getting new sails, then watch out. just a question of modifying the rigging!}
<A>__{angle on mike's "green machine" jackie, mike and andy, clipping along, larry vaughn and bob in the sizzler nearby. mike lifts the hull, jackie squeals in delight.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{wheee! faster!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{how fast is enough?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i want to go faster!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{hang on...}
<A>__{he trims his sheets, the cat heels more, one hull flying, andy and jackie clinging to the trampoline.}
<B>__{angle on the sizzler}
<A>__{larry is carefully adjusting his tiller, bob senses what he's doing.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you coming up on him?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you bet. hang on...}
<A>__{they gybe sharply, running up behind the green cat.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{coming up! give way!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{like hell! we're on the starboard tack!}
<A>__{the sizzler and the "green machine" running close to each other; very tight two by two.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{don't let him pass. faster!}
<A>__{mike and larry silently fight for clean air, racing. water splashes over them.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{my hair's getting wet!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{so's mine.}
<A>__{close on mike's boat he veers onto a less dramatic tack, sparing jackie's hair. larry and bob speed by, yelling.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{when do we get to the lighthouse?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{soon, dark eyes, soon.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{the tide's turning.}
<A>__{andy reveals a knowledgeable side to his character.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{we're going to be fighting the current.}
<P>__{(he looks up)}
<D>__{wind's backing around a few points, too.}
<A>__{jackie snuggles against mike.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i can't wait to get there.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{but of course.}
<A>__{he goes forward to trim the jib, leaving the lovebirds snuggling astern. they pull away from us, and we:}
