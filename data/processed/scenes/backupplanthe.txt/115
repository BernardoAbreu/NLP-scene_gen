<A>__{zoe enters the apartment and slams the door behind her. she runs to the couch and collapses in tears. nuts wheels over and stands beside her.}
<L>__{interior le pain quotidien day}
<A>__{zoe and mona are at their usual table. zoe looks like she hasn't slept.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{do you really think something happened with the berry girl? they both said nothing happened.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{well, are they going to come out and tell me? and that's not even the pointerior he said, the babies weren't his. and if he says that, he thinks that. and if he thinks that, he's not really committed.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{so, now you run?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{why should i stick around for the end of the story when i know what it's going to be?}
<A>__{mona says nothing. she looks like she might say something and then doesn't.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{what? if you want to say something, say it.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{do you know the end of the story? can't you just give him the benefit of the doubt? he seems like such a good guy.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{you haven't even met him.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{yeah, and don't think i don't know the reason for that. you were never going to see this through, zoe. never. it was doomed before it began. just like all of your relationships. you get out before you get hurt.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{you don't think i'm hurt right now?}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{every man is not your father. when are you going to realize that?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{you don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{i've known you for thirty years. i know you don't trust people. you and your grandmother, both. she's been engaged to arthur for how long now?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{leave nana out of this.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{she's never going to marry him. just like you'd never marry stan. no wonder you ended up with a sperm donor. he'll never let you down. it's your ideal boyfriend.}
<A>__{zoe's face changes. she looks incredibly hurt.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i used a donor because i wanted a baby.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i went too far.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{because i wanted to have a family. because nana is the only one i've got and she's eighty four years old. and then it will just be me. so, yeah, you went a little too far.}
<A>__{zoe leaves mona at the table.}
