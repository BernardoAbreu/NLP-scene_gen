<L>__{exterior riverbed dusk}
<A>__{gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction the storm drain by hollenbeck bridge takes. it is headed above toward the hollywood hills, where the sun is setting.}
<L>__{exterior gittes in car nightfall}
<A>__{winding his way up a section of the hollywood hills. he picks up on an open flood channel with the spotlight by the driver's windwing.}
<B>__{gittes in car moving}
<A>__{along the flood channel. it is dark now and gittes follows the channel with the car spotlight. he turns at a fork in the road which allows him to continue following the flood channel.}
<B>__{further up moving}
<A>__{the road is narrower. gittes drives more slowly. foliage is overgrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be glimpsed.}
<B>__{still further night}
<A>__{the road is dirt. heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus are everywhere. it is very still. another turn and a pie shaped view of a lake of lights in the city below can be}
<B>__{glimpsed.}
<A>__{pov chain link fence over the road, bolted. it says "oak pass reservoir. keep out. no trespassing." the chain link itself actually extends over the flood channel and down into it, making access along the channel itself impossible. gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the spotlight. a lone light overhead on tension wires is the sole illumination. there is only the eerie sound of the tension wires humming. gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the flood channel itself.}
<B>__{on the other side}
<A>__{gittes carefully works his way up through the thick foliage toward a second and large chain link fence. lights from the reservoir still higher above can be seen. suddenly there is a gunshot. then another. gittes dives into the flood control channel, which is at this point about four feet deep and six feet wide. there is the sound of men scurrying through the brush, coming near him, then retreating. gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel. he waits. the men seem to have passed him by. but there is another sound now. an echoing growing sound. it puzzles gittes. he starts to lift his head to catch the direction.}
<B>__{gittes in flood control channel night}
<A>__{then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over him, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel, banging into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out. but the force of the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's brought rudely to the chainlink fence. it stops him cold. he's nearly strained through it. swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing water by means of the fence itself. drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and makes his way toward his car. at gittes' car he fishes for his car keys, looks down. one shoe is missing.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(grumbling)}
<D>__{goddam florsheim shoe, goddammit.}
<A>__{he starts to get into his car but mulvihill and a smaller man stop him. mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning his arms, holding him tightly. the smaller man thrusts a switchblade knife about an inch and a half up gittes' left nostril.}
<C>__{smaller man}
<P>__{(shaking with emotion)}
<D>__{hold it there, kitty cat.}
<B>__{close gittes}
<A>__{frozen, the knife in his nostril, the street lamp overhead gleaming on the silvery blade.}
<C>__{the smaller man}
<D>__{you are a very nosey fellow, kitty cat... you know what happens to nosey fellows?}
<A>__{the smaller man actually seems to be trembling with rage when he says this. gittes doesn't move.}
<C>__{smaller man}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{wanna guess? no? okay, lose their noses.}
<A>__{with a quick flick the smaller man pulls back on the blade, laying gittes' left nostril open about an inch further. gittes screams. blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat. gittes bends over, instinctively trying to keep the blood from getting on his clothes. mulvihill and the smaller man stare at him.}
<C>__{the smaller man}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{next time you lose the whole thing, kitty cat. i will cut it off and feed it to my goldfish, understand?}
<C>__{mulvihill}
<D>__{tell him you understand, gittes.}
