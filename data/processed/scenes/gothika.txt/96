<L>__{interior woodward cafeteria day}
<A>__{bustling with activity. the room is divided into two: a large main area where the patients eat, plus a second, smaller upstairs area for the staff. boom down to find miranda eating at a long table. shelley beside her, playing with her plastic fork. jenna taps an unlit cigarette. as usual, irene keeps watch nearby.}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{... she'd get high on glue and make me help her try on my bras. is that the strangest shit you've heard?}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{heard stranger. but she's a case.}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{and she always put on a happy face. man, what an optometrist.}
<A>__{optometrist? miranda starts to correct her, but lets it go.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{you narced her out, didn't you? boo hoo. bet you were a little buzzed yourself.}
<A>__{miranda's gaze strays from this, um, most compelling of conversations and comes to rest on chloe. alone at another table. heavily sedated. a wreck. miranda rises and walks over. shelley waits until she's out of hearing range, leans in to jenna }
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{all work, that woman. work, work, work.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{she's like an alcoholic. but with work.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{what work?}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{not safe to tell you. wish i could.}
<A>__{jenna rolls her eyes, returns to her food.}
<B>__{upstairs}
<A>__{parsons watches intrigued as miranda sits beside chloe and starts talking. from parson's pov up above we can see pretty much the entire dining area.}
<B>__{back to miranda}
<A>__{trying to get chloe's attention. but chloe just stares at her untouched food, glassy eyed.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i saw what happened. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{no reaction.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{have you told anyone? chloe?}
<A>__{nothing.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{look, chloe the person who did this to you is not the devil. and if you can identify him, i will make sure the motherfucker is arrested.}
<A>__{now chloe looks at her, like something finally registers.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{doctor, did you just say 'motherfucker'?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{do you know his name? maybe you saw a nametag on his uniform? think.}
<A>__{chloe simply stares. finally shakes her head.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{man, you must really hate me.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what? i don't hate you.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{you hate me because now you're just the same as me. you must feel so embarrassed.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i don't hate you. and i don't feel embarrassed.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{that's just a pat answer you have because you're new at this. trust me, i know what i'm talking about.}
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{forget it, alright? forget we had this conversation.}
<A>__{chloe abruptly grabs her arm. tightly.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{you know what happens next?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i get the distinct feeling you're going to tell me.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{the shock wears off and the guilt kicks in. and that guilt is the real motherfucker. you'll be watched 24 seven, because they're afraid you'll kill yourself. dr. graham will question every harmless gesture, every innocent comment, ever twitch you make and eventually and it's a fucking tedious 'eventually' you'll stop hating yourself for what you did. but what replaces that hatred is this unbearable sadness. and you don't lose that as long as you live.}
<A>__{push in on miranda. deeply affected by chloe's words, as we }
