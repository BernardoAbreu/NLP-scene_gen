<A>__{the doorbell buzz shrieks through the room. it stops. starts again. a ghostly dawn finds utah and tyler sleeping peacefully, limbs entwined like vines. johnny's eyes snap open. spies the clock. 4:00 a.m. tyler stirs beside him, coming out of sleep. johnny wraps a blanket around his waist and staggers to the door. bodhi stands outside the door wearing a lunatic grin. behind him nathaniel, roach and grommet hoot from the pickup.}
