<A>__{the long work space is full of tables at which conservatively dressed women are working, making jewelry out of shellac, a black resin which looks like jet. an impressive sight: obviously a very successful business. a wooden staircase climbs one wall to a glass windowed business office. the figure of a man within.}
<C>__{foreman}
<P>__{(flirtatiously, to women)}
<D>__{at the end of the day you get nothing for nothing! sitting flat on your bum doesn't buy any bread!}

<A>__{the foreman has stopped beside fantine, a pretty young woman. as he leans over to whisper in her ear fantine, surprised, pricks her finger with her needle.}
<C>__{foreman}
<P>__{(quietly, to fantine)}
<D>__{and in a bed!}
<C>__{factory woman 8}
<P>__{(to fantine, as a warning)}

<C>__{main factory woman}
<D>__{have you seen how the foreman is fuming today with his terrible breath and his wandering hands?}
<C>__{factory woman 3}
<D>__{it's because little fantine won't give him his way.}
<C>__{factory woman 5}
<D>__{take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands!}
<C>__{factory woman 2}
<D>__{and the boss, he never knows that the foreman is always on heat.}
<C>__{main factory woman}
<D>__{if fantine doesn't look out, watch how she goes, she'll be out on the street!}
<A>__{the foreman rings a bell, announcing the end of the work day. the women start to take off their overalls and pack up their tools for the day.}

<C>__{main factory woman}
<D>__{and what have we here, little innocent sister?}
<A>__{the letter is passed surreptitiously down the line of women workers.}
<C>__{main factory woman}
<D>__{come on, fantine, let's have all the news.}
<P>__{(reading)}

<C>__{main factory woman}
<D>__{you can guess how she picks up the extra you can bet she's earning her keep sleeping around! and the boss wouldn't like it.}

<D>__{yes, it's true there's a child and the child is my daughter and her father abandoned us, leaving us flat. now she lives with an innkeeper man and his wife and i pay for the child. what's the matter with that?}
<A>__{fantine continues to defend herself to the foreman, as the women sing }
<C>__{factory women}
<D>__{at the end of the day she'll be nothing but trouble and there's trouble for all when there's trouble for one! while we're earning our daily bread she's the one with her hands in the butter you must send the slut away or we're all going to end in the gutter and it's us who'll have to pay at the end of the day!}

<D>__{m'sieur mayor, help me! i have a child!}
<A>__{valjean hears the cry, but he has other concerns. he turns round to face javert. javert stares at him. on the factory floor below, the foreman hustles fantine out, as she struggles against him.}
