<A>__{he backs away from the water and hides the sword in the reeds, and starts back.}
<L>__{exterior moors by the sea evening}
<A>__{perceval dismounts, rushing to kneel at the king's side. arthur looks up, calm and intense.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{when you threw it in, what did you see?}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{...i saw nothing.}
<A>__{the king looks at him with piercing power. perceval blurts it out.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{my king, i couldn't do it. excalibur cannot be lost. other men }
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{ by itself it is only a piece of steel. its power comes from he who wields it. for now there is no one. do as i have ordered!}
<A>__{perceval leaves once more. the daylight is failing, the sun is near the horizon over the sea, bursting through clouds.}
