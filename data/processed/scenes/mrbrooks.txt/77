<L>__{exterior drug store parking lot n night}
<A>__{in the scattering of vehicles mr. brooks' toyota is hidden in plain sight in a row of cars.}
<L>__{interior toyota n night}
<A>__{behind the wheel, mr. brooks is again wearing his pottery throwing clothes. mr. smith is in the passenger seat and marshall is leaning forward from the back. they're all focused to varying degrees on the entrance to the store. mr. smith raises his watch for a look at the time.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{maybe he went home with someone else.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{can you still see his pickup?}
<A>__{mr. smith looks.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{this is not the kind of guy who leaves his pickup in an unguarded lot overnight.}
<A>__{the silence returns. all three men idly observe an old green pontiac convertible with a frayed top and paint peeling, come into the lot and park two spaces away facing them. we saw this car last watching atwood from outside the murder house. the headlights go off. the driver's door opens. the woman who was with meeks in the van steps out and hurries toward the drug store. she of course means nothing to mr. brooks but in the brief seconds the domelight is on, he catches sight of the man in the passenger seat. a memory tickles his brain. he turns to marshall.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{where do we know that guy from?}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{you really should pay more attention to what you read, earl.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{that's what i have you for, marshall.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{his picture was on the front page of the paper a couple days ago because he escaped from jail. he's the killer they call the hangman.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{ahh...}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{remember that cop you like, atwood, who's chasing us, she's the one who put him away. i think his name is thorton meeks.}
<A>__{mr. brooks cocks his head at the vague outline of meeks.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{well, well, well... what would life be without surprises?}
<A>__{mr. smith who, remember, cannot hear or see marshall, straightens up.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{there he is!}
<A>__{the man they are waiting for is coming down the steps of the store. on the way to his pickup he takes off a manager's smock.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{you know what's weird? i will bet he has all these plans of what he's going to do tonight and tomorrow and he doesn't know he will already be dead and won't be able to do any of them.}
<A>__{mr. brooks nods absently. the drug store manager arrives at his truck.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i don't think i want to kill this guy.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{what?! but you promised we would!}
<A>__{marshall smiles.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{oh, i love what you're thinking.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{you have no idea what i'm thinking.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{oh yes i do, and it's wonderfully twisted.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(to mr. smith)}
<D>__{i know i said we would, but i don't think it would be that much fun.}
<A>__{mr. brooks starts the car and puts it in reverse.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{so just like that, you're saying 'no', it's not going to happen.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<P>__{(purses his lips into a tight line)}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{mr. brooks casts his eyes on the license plate of the car meeks is in.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{you get the number?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i got it.}
