<D>__{get it together. control it. don't feel. don't feel. don't feel!}
<A>__{she hears ice cracking. stops. looks around. she's left a sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor. they grow up the wall, taking over the castle.}

<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{are you cold?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{...a little.}
<A>__{he reaches like he might put an arm around her, but decides against it. he looks around as if he doesn't know what to do, then gets a thought.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{wait. come here.}
<A>__{he takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock lined pass. steam vents, powered by the volcanic activity, dot the path. he holds her hands over one of them.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oooh.... that's nice.}
<A>__{they continue on the path, walking from vent to vent.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<P>__{(taking a deep breath)}
<D>__{so, about my friends...well, i say friends, they're more like family.... anyway, when i was a kid, it was just me and sven...until they took me in.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(moved)}
<D>__{they did?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<P>__{(nervous ramble)}
<D>__{yeah. i don't want to scare you, they can be a little bit inappropriate...and loud...very loud...they're also stubborn at times, and a little overbearing. and heavy. really, really heavy.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{but they're fine.. you'll get it. they mean well.}
<A>__{anna touches kristoff's arm, reassuringly.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{kristoff, they sound wonderful.}
<A>__{kristoff smiles, appreciating her sincerity.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{okay then....}
<A>__{mustering the courage, kristoff steps forward and with a wave of the arms announces }
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{meet my family.}
<A>__{reveal: he's surrounded by rocks.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<P>__{(to the rocks)}
<D>__{hey, guys!}
<A>__{as kristoff and sven move through the rocks, waving and greeting, olaf and anna stand frozen, dumbfounded.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{...they're rocks.}
<C>__{olaf}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{he's crazy.}
<P>__{(covertly, to anna)}
<D>__{i will distract them while you run.}
<P>__{(loud and slow to a rock)}
<D>__{hi, sven's family! it's nice to meet you!}
<P>__{(quietly to anna)}
<D>__{anna, because i love you, i insist you run.}
<P>__{(to the rock)}
<D>__{i understand you're love experts!}
<P>__{(to anna)}
<D>__{why aren't you running?}
<A>__{anna snaps out of her shock and starts backing away.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{okay. um...i'm gonna go }
<A>__{just then the rocks around her start rolling.}
<C>__{anna }
<P>__{(panicking)}
<D>__{kristoff!}
<A>__{olaf lights up and chases the rocks, who surround kristoff and unfold as trolls.}
<C>__{bulda}
<D>__{kristoff's home!}
<C>__{trolls }
<D>__{kristoff! kristoff's home! it's been too long! kristoff's home!}
<A>__{olaf jumps around all excitedly.}
<C>__{olaf}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{kristoff's home.}
<A>__{he then stops, confused, and looks to one of the trolls.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{wait? kristoff?}
<A>__{anna watches, shocked and confused. the trolls all want kristoff's attention. one troll yanks him down with a boulder's strength.}
<C>__{troll one}
<D>__{oh, lemme look at you!}
<A>__{another troll tries to pull off his clothes.}
<C>__{troll two}
<D>__{oh, take off your clothes, kristoff; i wash them.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<P>__{(holding up his pants)}
<D>__{ah! no. i'm gonna keep my clothes on, thank you.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{great to see you all. where's grandpa?}
<C>__{mushroom kid troll}
<D>__{he's napping. but look, i grew a mushroom.}
<C>__{troll scout kid}
<D>__{and i earned my fire crystal.}
<C>__{kidney stone troll}
<D>__{i passed a kidney stone.}
<C>__{pick me up troll}
<D>__{pick me up.}
<A>__{the kid troll jumps up on kristoff's arm. kristoff sinks under the weight of him. anna still stares, confused, then realizes...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{trolls? they're trolls.}
<A>__{silence. all troll eyes turn to anna. blink. blink.}
<C>__{bulda}
<D>__{...he's brought a girl!}
<C>__{trolls }
<D>__{he's brought a girl!}
<A>__{suddenly anna is surrounded by trolls. they body surf roll anna over to kristoff. she falls into his arms.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{i've learned to just roll with it.}
<A>__{bulda climbs on top of her husband, cliff, to get a good look at anna. she studies her like she's a piece of cattle.}
<C>__{bulda}
<D>__{let me see. bright eyes. working nose. strong teeth. yes, yes, yes. she'll do nicely for our kristoff.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{wait. oh. um. no.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{you've got the wrong idea. that's not why i brought her here.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{right. we're not. i'm not }
<A>__{anna laughs, uncomfortable, not knowing what to say.}
<C>__{bulda}
<P>__{(to anna)}
<D>__{what's the issue, dear? why are you holding back from such a man?}
<A>__{bulda sings.}
<D>__{"fixer upper"}
<C>__{trolls }
<D>__{is it the clumpy way he walks? or the grumpy way he talks? or the pear shaped, square shaped weirdness of his feet? and though we know he washes well he always ends up sorta smelly. but you'll never meet a fella who's as sensitive and sweet. trolls (chorus) (cont'd) so he's a bit of a fixer upper, so he's got a few flaws his peculiar brain, dear. his thing for the reindeer that outside a few of nature's laws. so he's a bit of a fixer upper, but this we're certain of you can fix this fixer upper up with a little bit of love.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{can we just stop talking about this?! we've got a real, actual problem here.}
<C>__{bulda}
<D>__{i will say }
<P>__{(to anna)}
<D>__{is it the way that he runs scared?}
<C>__{trolls }
<D>__{or that he's socially impaired?}
<C>__{kid troll}
<D>__{or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods?}
<C>__{trolls }
<D>__{are you holding back your fondness due to his unmanly blondeness? or the way he covers up that he's the honest goods? trolls (chorus) (cont'd) he's just a bit of a fixer upper he's got a couple a' bugs.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{no, i don't.}
<C>__{trolls}
<D>__{his isolation is confirmation of his desperation for healing hugs. so he's a bit of a fixer upper, but we know what to do. the way to fix up this fixer upper is to fix him up with you.}
<A>__{the girl trolls sweep anna away. the boys take kristoff.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<P>__{(to the male trolls)}
<D>__{enough! she's engaged to someone else. okay?!}
<A>__{trolls beat. blink. blink. the boy trolls turn, huddle...}
<C>__{trolls }
<D>__{so she's a bit of a fixer upper, that's a minor thing. this quote "engagement" is a flex arrangement.}
<C>__{kid troll}
<D>__{and by the way, i don't see no ring.}
<C>__{trolls }
<D>__{so she's a bit of a fixer upper, her brain's a bit betwixt. get the fiance out of the way and the whole thing will be fixed!}
<C>__{girl trolls}
<D>__{we aren't saying you can change him}
<C>__{trolls }
<D>__{'cause people don't really change. we're only saying that love's a force that's powerful and strange. people make bad choices if they're mad or scared or stressed. trolls (various) (cont'd) but throw a little love their way}
<P>__{(throw a little love their way)}
<D>__{and you'll bring out their best! true love brings out the best!}
<A>__{kristoff looks over at anna. she actually looks shockingly beautiful dressed in moss, lit by shimmering crystals.}
<C>__{all trolls}
<D>__{everyone's a bit of a fixer upper, that's what it's all about father, sister, brother we need each other to raise us up and round us out}
<A>__{by this time kristoff and anna are being ushered into a pit by the sheer force of numbers.}
<C>__{trolls}
<D>__{everyone's a bit of a fixer upper, but when push comes to shove the only fixer upper fixer that can fix a fixer upper is true true true true love}
<A>__{during this last bit anna and kristoff are looking at each other differently. hmmm. maybe those trolls are right? sparks! chemistry!}
<C>__{troll priest}
<D>__{do you, anna, take kristoff to be your trollfully wedded }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{wait, what?!}
<C>__{troll priest}
<D>__{you're getting married.}
<C>__{trolls}
<D>__{love!}
<A>__{just then, anna collapses. kristoff catches her. she's shivering something fierce.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{anna?}
<A>__{he pulls off her cape and hat.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{she's as cold as ice.}
<A>__{just then grand pabbie pushes his way through the crowd. trolls clear the way for pabbie. he stops at the edge of the pit.}
<C>__{grand pabbie}
<D>__{there's strange magic here!}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{grand pabbie!}
<C>__{grand pabbie}
<D>__{bring her to me, kristoff.}
<A>__{kristoff helps anna over. pabbie looks into her weak eyes.}
<C>__{grand pabbie }
<D>__{anna, your life is in danger. there is ice in your heart, put there by your sister. if not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what...? no.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{so remove it, grand pabbie.}
<C>__{grand pabbie}
<D>__{i can't. if it was her head, that would be easy. but only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{an act of true love?}
<C>__{bulda}
<P>__{(googley, to her hubby)}
<D>__{a true love's kiss, perhaps?}
<A>__{a bunch of trolls give each other kisses. anna shivers again, collapsing into kristoff's arms. more of her hair turns white.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{anna, we've got to get you back to hans.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(still weak)}
<D>__{...hans.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{help us out, sven.}
<A>__{kristoff grabs sven's antlers. sven pulls them out. kristoff helps anna onto sven and hops up behind her.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{come on, olaf!}
<A>__{sven takes off. olaf grabs sven's tail, rides with them.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{i'm coming! let's go kiss hans! who is this hans?!}
