<A>__{as amos pulls karl aside to give him the hard sell, edward notices a beautiful young woman (16) leaving with her family. she's wearing a blue dress and hat. for no good reason, she looks back at edward. the two make eye contact. and as they do, all motion freezes. a fiery baton remains mid twirl, flames locked in place. a spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid air, each kernel like a snowflake. even the elephant is mid poop. only edward is free to move, winding his way between the frozen bodies, ducking underneath arms to get closer and closer to this woman.}
