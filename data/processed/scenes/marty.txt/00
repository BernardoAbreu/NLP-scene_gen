<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{just east of webster avenue in the north bronx, 187th street is a predominantly italian community and the commercial avenue of the neighborhood. fruit and vegetable stands, pizzerias, butcher shops, bakeries, cleaners and dyers and bars flourish. it is saturday morning around eleven o'clock a market day. women, dark, gesticulative, with bulging cloth shopping bags, baby carriages. merchants at their improvised street stands, hawking their wares, disputing with their customers, roaring salutations to passersby. in the midst of all this, camera homes in on a typical neighborhood...}
<B>__{butcher shop.}
<A>__{delicatessens hang on the walls, wreathed with garlands of garlic. patsy, the boss, a swarthy man of sixty, is flopping a chunk of beef onto the scale for the benefit of a forty year old matron. there are three or four other women in the shop, all talking to one another. a four year old boy lazily chases a cat. the white refrigerator room door opens, and a second butcher, marty pilletti, comes out carrying a large leg of lamb. marty is a mildmannered, short, stout, balding man of thirty four. his charm lies in an almost indestructible good humor. he drops the leg of lamb onto the chopping block, reaches up for the cleaver hanging with the other utensils over the block and makes quick incisive cuts into the leg of lamb. he sets the cleaver aside, picks up the saw to finish the cuts as he chats with his customer, mrs. fusari.}
<C>__{mrs. fusari}
<D>__{your kid brother got married last sunday, eh, marty?}
