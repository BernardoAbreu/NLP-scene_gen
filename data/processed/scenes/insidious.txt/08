<A>__{josh lambert (37) gapes into the mirror, face covered in soap. he washes it off. now he's awake we see that he is a handsome, clean cut guy a former high school nerd who got revenge by growing into his body. he sorts through a box labelled josh's bathroom stuff. he takes out two bottles toner and moisturizer. he dabs the toner on, then smooths the moisturizer into his forehead and around his eyes. he suddenly notices a grey hair. looks mortified.}
