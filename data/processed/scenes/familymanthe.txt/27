<A>__{jack nods.}
<C>__{cash }
<D>__{so you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe i shouldn't do this, i shoulda done that.}

<D>__{what do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? you're just gonna do something you'll regret...}
<C>__{cash}
<D>__{you want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.}
<A>__{jack casually takes the egg nog out of the bag, opens the carton...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy. at a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...}
<C>__{cash}
<D>__{yeah, in most cases that'd be true.}
<A>__{jack takes a sip of the egg nog.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...}
<C>__{cash}
<P>__{(a deep laugh)}
<D>__{wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?}
<A>__{a look from jack...}
<C>__{cash }

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look, i'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...}
<C>__{cash}
<P>__{(a hearty laugh)}
<D>__{you still think this is about me, don't you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sure it's about you. but it's about society, too.}
<C>__{cash}
<D>__{oh man, i'm gonna enjoy this one... just remember, jack, you did this. you brought this on yourself...}
<A>__{and with that, cash turns and leaves jack alone on the street with his egg nog...}
