<L>__{interior emily's bedroom night}
<A>__{emily in glasses, reading the sheridan file on her bed. the preliminary report concerns her: "socially withdrawn. lack of appetite. sleeping at school..." her gaze returns to lucy's photo. sadly, under her breath:}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{what are they doing to you?}
<L>__{exterior sheridan house day}
<A>__{a dark, rundown family home on a once prosperous cul de sac. emily pulls up. gets out. checks that she has the right address. halfway up the walk something stops her dead in her}
<D>__{tracks }
<A>__{a woman's face staring at her through one of the lacy white curtains upstairs. ghostly pale. gone as soon as she sees it. emily stands frozen for a moment. walks on. she reaches to knock on the door and it opens abruptly, the security chain snapping taut. a woman's voice growls at her from the darkness inside:}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{emily jennings. child services? we spoke on the phone...?}
<A>__{peering through the crack is the pallid, bony face from the upstairs window. lucy's mother. margaret sheridan.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{you said the seventeenth.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{today is the seventeenth.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{is not.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but it is.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{friday was the thirteenth.}
<A>__{emily, rather amazed at the conversation she's having, takes a newspaper from her bag. indicates the date.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{friday was the fourteenth, that makes today the seventeenth. monday the seventeenth. the date of our appointment.}
<A>__{the door closes in emily's face. what the hell? then we hear the chain unlock. it opens again. and we get our first good look at lucy's mother. gaunt. pale. dark rings under her eyes. she steps aside, not welcoming emily in, merely allowing her to enter.}
