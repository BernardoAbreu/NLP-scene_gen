<L>__{interior greenhouse next day}
<A>__{nell stares at the tableaux of hugh crain. in the morning light it seems inert, cold, just a statue. luke and theo enter. nell doesn't seem to notice them until they're beside her.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{marrow said the same thing as last night, he}
<A>__{says }
<P>__{(meaning, this is}
<D>__{on his now}
<P>__{doubtful word)}
<D>__{ that he checked with mrs. dudley. and he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the west wing connect to the main chimney. he says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current }
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{ what do you think?}
<A>__{theo considers, then looks at her, severe.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(lowers his voice)}
<D>__{don't tell the professor; he'd probably throw me out. but test taking is one of the ways i've been supporting myself. i volunteer for every paid study that they offer. of course straight psych stuff doesn't pay as much as the pharmaceuticals do, or a good wound study. check it out.}
<A>__{he rolls up his sleeve revealing large, livid scars at intervals too regular to be anything natural.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{a thousand dollars each. am i sick? yes. do you know why i only date freshmen? by the time they're sophomores, they've figured me out.}
<C>__{theo}
<P>__{(get back on track!)}
<D>__{mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{the whole thing feels like experimental misdirection. like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but i think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{no. no... jim's not doing these things.}
<A>__{but there's a desperate, rising edge to nell's voice. theo's, in response, is quiet, sober... certain.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{then who is? come on, nell. deep down, if you really thought it wasn't jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second? why wouldn't you be afraid? really afraid.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{because i don't want to ruin things. because home is where the heart is.}
<A>__{theo is chilled by this answer which would only make sense to someone out of her mind. nell looks up and sees the double staircase at the end of the greenhouse... the one where crain's wife killed herself. and for a moment we see crain's wife hanging there and then the image is gone...}
