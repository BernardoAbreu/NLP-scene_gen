<L>__{interior x flat day}
<A>__{light from the x window shines on a florida tourist poster as ratso leads joe into an abandoned tub in kitchen flat, barely furnished with a table and chair, a rumple of blankets on a burnt out mattress.}

<D>__{i got no heat, but by that time, you know, cold weather, hey, i will be in florida. stretch out. make yourself comfortable. you hungry? i will put up some water for coffee.}
<A>__{ratso fills a saucepan from the tub sink, sets it on a sterno stove. joe sits himself on the mattress bed, pretending to test it, weeks of exhaustion and tension overwhelming him suddenly, his only immediate problem being the effort to restrain a large, comfortable yawn.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{comfortable, kee rist, i slept on subways softer than this.}
<A>__{joe stretches himself, yawning, his eyelids drooping heavily. the sounds of the city recede. joe's love theme plays softly on a distant radio. joe's eyes close momentarily in spite of him elf.}
