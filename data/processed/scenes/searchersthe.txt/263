<A>__{as martin enters. one robe, tossed back, shows where scar has slept. against one wall lie the huddled figures of two squaws. two other figures one being debbie's sleep in robes. martin's eyes go to scar's place and then rove slowly and hold on:}

<A>__{she moves slightly so that the light strikes her fair hair. martin kneels close to her and gently touches her shoulder, to awaken her. her eyes open, then widen in fear. martin quickly claps a hand over his mouth. silently she fights him, trying to pull the hand away.}

<P>__{(a hoarse whisper)}
<D>__{debbie... don't!}
<A>__{and then her fingernails rake his hand. he winces and lets go. she screams and tries to leap up. he grabs her. the other squaws wake begin squawking.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(grimly)}
