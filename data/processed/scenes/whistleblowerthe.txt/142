<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{i've called and paged. he says he can't get into this now.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{does he know that one of my witnesses was abducted? where is he?}
<C>__{secretary}

<D>__{it's not your fault.}
<A>__{kathy is downcast. she nods, not totally convinced.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{irka won't testify now. it's completely understandable. she's way too scared. i just... i don't know what to do with her. the gda won't take her and her traffickers will find her if she's in this city.}
<A>__{emotion taking over...}
<C>__{kathy }
<D>__{these girls are dragged into this country like cattle and then the system that's supposed to help them spits them right back out. it barely recognizes sex trafficking as a problem even though it's a fucking epidemic, and everyone knows it. are we supposed to wait around for that to change?}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{maybe it's time for a little diplomacy... do you have a nice frock?}
