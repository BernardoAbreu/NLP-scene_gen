<L>__{interior oracle's chambers (matrix) day}
<A>__{it looks like a suburban tract house. there is a lot of cozy furniture, a dining roon hutch filled with china, shelves and tables crowded with doilies, knick knacks and ceramic brick a brack. neo follows the plastic carpet runner to the kitchen. a woman is huddled beside the oven, peering inside through the cracked door.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{oracle }
<D>__{i know. you're neo. be right with you.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{you're the oracle?}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{bingo. i got to say i love seeing you non believers. it's really a relief. all that pomp and circumstances just plain tucker me out. almost done. smell good, don't they?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{i'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway. and don't worry about the vase.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what vase?}
<A>__{he turns to look around and his elbow knocks a vase from the table. it breaks against the linoleum floor.}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{the vase.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{shit, i'm sorry.}
<A>__{she pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns. she is an older woman, wearing big oven mitts, comfortable slacks and a print blouse. she looks like someone's grandma.}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{i said don't worry about it. i will get one of my kids to fix it.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{how did you know...?}
<A>__{she sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot pad.}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{what's really going to bake your noodle later on is, would you still have broken it if i hadn't said anything.}
<A>__{smiling, she lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{you're cuter than i thought. i see why she likes you.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{not too bright, though.}
<A>__{she winks.}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{you know why morpheus brought you to see me?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{so? what do you think? you think you're the one?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{she gestures to a wooden plaque, the kind every grandma has, except that the words are in latin.}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{you know what that means? it's latin. means, 'know thyself.'}
<A>__{she puts her cigarette down.}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{well, let's have a look at you.}
<A>__{she widens his eyes, checks his ears, then feels the glands in his neck.}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{open your mouth. say, 'ahhh.'}
<A>__{she nods then looks at his palms.}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{hmmm. you sure got the gift, but it's tricky. i'd say the bad news is, you're not the one. still got a lot to learn. maybe next life.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what's the good news?}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{same as the bad news, you're not the one.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{is that it, then?}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{no. here.}
<A>__{she picks up the tray of cooling cookies.}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{you better take a cookie. got a big day ahead of you.}
<A>__{he eyes her, then takes a cookie.}
<C>__{oracle}
<D>__{make a believer out of you yet.}
