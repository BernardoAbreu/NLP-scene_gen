<A>__{an excerpt from the gong show (reenacted). the video image fills the screen. we watch a fat man recite hamlet, punctuating his soliloquy with loud belching noises. the audience is booing. eventually the man gets gonged. chuck barris, age 50, hat pulled over his eyes, dances out from the wings to comfort the agitated performer.}

<B>__{the gong show}
<A>__{chuck barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog. the audience howls with glee. suddenly the video image explodes. slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot toward the camera. we pull back to reveal we're in a darkened, messy hotel room. we pan across the walls, past taped up, yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like "gong show a new low in television", "the dumbing of america", and "chuck barris is the decline of western civilization." we come to rest on a naked middle aged man crouching in the shadows in the corner, holding a gun. this is chuck barris. the television continues to sputter, spark, and smoke. there is a knock at the door.}

<D>__{oh christ. oh crap.}
<A>__{barris tries to stop renda from screaming by covering the hole in renda's face. barris throws up, some of it landing on renda's pants. he wipes his own mouth with his bloody hand and looks at the still screaming renda. the churchgoers are starting to squint in barris's direction. barris shoots renda again. and again and again and again and again. more blood spatters barris's clothing and face. the church bell continues to chime.}

<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{i think you might be interested when i tell you it's the mole who fingered your friends jim byrd and paul picard... and seigfried keeler.}

<D>__{yes, of course he did. he threw himself from a twentieth floor window after he strangled himself to death with an electrical cord.}

<D>__{indeed. where to begin. first, let go of me.}
<A>__{barris lets go. oliver sits in a chair, straightens his shirt.}
<C>__{oliver }
<D>__{let's see. well, you had a twin sister, stillborn, strangled by your umbilical cord. your first hit, chuck. your mother always wanted a daughter. she blamed you for your sister's death. and, so, until your sister phoebe was born, she raised you as a girl.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{that's not true.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{oh, and your father the dentist? not really your father. your biological father was a man named edmund james windsor. a serial killer. a fact your mother didn't know when she had an affair with him in 1930. if you want to look him up, he was also known as the tarrytown troll, because he had been described by witnesses as short and ugly. windsor died in the electrical chair at ossining in 1939. we believed your self loathing tendencies coupled with that extra y chromosome and whatever else you inherited from your father would serve us well.}

<D>__{you're lying.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{i'm trying to think what more i can tell you. i'm sure there's more. but you have me at a disadvantage here, barris. i don't have your files in front of me.}

<D>__{just leave me the hell alone!}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{your mother always loved the game shows, and you so wanted to please her. we never expected the game show business to work out for you. but that it did, turned out to be in our favor. i guess your need to be a good daughter drove you more than we anticipated.}
