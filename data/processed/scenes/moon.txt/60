<A>__{gerty applies a translucent balm to the burn.}

<D>__{you saw something on the tv?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(a touch petulant)}

<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{sam, you said it was the tv that distracted you, but when i came in the tv wasn't on.}

<C>__{gerty }

<A>__{gerty has hit the nail on the head, in a way that makes sam feel a little uneasy. is there something gerty knows that sam doesn't?}
