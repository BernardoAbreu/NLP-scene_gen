<A>__{luther walks quickly up and here we get a sense of the vast size of the place it feels bigger inside than it looked in the moonlight. a van gogh at the head of the stairs. luther moves past it, then stops, goes back, studies the painting. it's a late one, when the madness had him and things were sliding away. very sad. luther looks at it admiringly for another moment then surprisingly he raises his hand, and for just an instant traces the lines of the painting in the air, as if trying to figure out how the magic was done, as if getting ready for his next museum session then almost grudgingly, he moves on, up toward the third floor.}
