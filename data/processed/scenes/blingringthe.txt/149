<A>__{close up: pan over his beautiful, gorgeous things. marc is stashing a bunch of his loot in a basement. we see him take a last look at a louis vuitton suitcase packed full of luxury bags and designer fashion. quilted chanel bags in every color, louboutin patent leather platform heels, marc jacobs crisp shirts. he touches them, and makes sure they're all tucked away carefully, before closing it up. we see there are several louis vuitton suitcases, he slides this one away next to them, and pulls a tarp over them in the corner and leaves them by some old christmas decorations. he turns off the light and heads up the stairs.}
