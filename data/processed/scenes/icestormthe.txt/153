<L>__{interior libbets' apartment. night}
<A>__{libbets puts a blanket over a sleeping francis, who's crashed out on the floor in a corner. francis alternates between snores and various mumbled delirious ravings.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{the foot... the foot... toeclipper man...}
<A>__{paul is sitting on the couch, and libbets comes back and sits at his feet, facing up to him.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i guess he's just real exhausted from, you know, tests and stuff.}

<P>__{(consciousness fading fast)}
<D>__{hah hah you're funny. a bath. like a brother and sister. oh man, i'm so wasted.}
<A>__{her head bobs and weaves, her eyes close, and suddenly her head falls forward with a whoosh toward the couch smack dab between paul's legs. she begins to snore instantly, her open mouth nuzzling into his crotch. paul doesn't move, doesn't even breathe. then, slowly, he leans his back into the couch, without shifting the rest of his body. he looks as though he has simultaneously won the lottery and received a lobotomy.}
