<L>__{exterior desert later}
<A>__{to strains of hendrix's wait until tomorrow the humvee cuts across the desert kicking up plumes of loose sand. it looks more a dune buggy out for a joy ride than a military vehicle.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{i e. humvee simultaneous epps drives, jaeger rides shotgun, relaxed, feet up on the dash. wes is in back with a "what the fuck did i get myself into look on his face." the hendrix comes from a walkman hooked up to a pair of small speakers. basically these guys are just kicking it. war? what war? our boys are just on a beer run. maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{now this is war.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{roger that.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{we're going to get court martialed, you know that.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{hell, we'll just buy our way out.}
<A>__{epps picks up a map and gives it a read. to jaeger he says:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{hand me the navicom.}
<A>__{jaeger hands epps a piece of electronic hardware no bigger than a video box. it's a navigational computer which can pinpoint its location, by satellite, within meters. basically the ultimate compass. epps compares the navicom's readout with the map.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{hold on boys and girls...hold on...}
<A>__{epps watches the navicom...watches it...}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{yeah! welcome to beautiful iraq. land of enchantment and riches.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{oh, god.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you're such a pussy, you know that? how'd you get in the army?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{cool it, jaeger. hey, wes? wes?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i'd settle for being alive. really. alive would be fine.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps, is that a sand dune.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{oh, no.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{why, yes, jaeger. i believe it is.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{no, please, not again.}
<A>__{epps punches the accelerator and the humvee jumps forward like a horse out of the gate.}
