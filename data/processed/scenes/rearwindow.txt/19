<A>__{the man enters the bedroom. we can see a woman lying on the far bed. near her, a small table is covered with medicine bottles, spoons, boxes of pills, a water pitcher and the other impedimenta of the chronically ill. the woman sits up as the man enters. she takes a wet cloth off her forehead. before the man even reaches her, she begins talking, somewhat vigorously. pointing to a wristwatch, she seems to be saying something such as "you should have been home two hours ago! i could be lying here dying for all you'd know or care!" the man stops short of the bed, makes gestures of trying to placate her, but she goes on scolding. his attitude changes to weary patience, then irritation, then anger. he shouts back at her, turns and goes out of the room. back in the living room, he picks up his hat, throws it against the wall in anger, and leaves the apartment, slamming the door behind him.}
