<A>__{jeff's attention is suddenly diverted to himself. his leg, under the cast, begins itching. he squirms, tries to move the leg a little. it gives no relief. he scratches the outside of the cast, but the itch gets worse. he reaches for a long, chinese back scratcher lying on the windowsill. carefully, and with considerable ingenuity, he works it under the cast. he scratches, and a look of sublime relief comes over his face. satisfied, he takes the scratcher out. as he replaces it on the windowsill, his attention is drawn back to the scene outside the window.}
