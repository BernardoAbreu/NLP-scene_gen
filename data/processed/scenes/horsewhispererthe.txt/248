<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i don't know. let's just go and... we'll see...}
<A>__{annie nods. he reaches for her hand, and annie gives it willingly... they begin to walk away from camera... together. annie begins to speak, telling him what we already know. how he will react or what will happen, is unknown. but these two people will no longer avoid their life together... somehow, they will make the effort to face it together. as camera widens, we see included in the frame, grace and pilgrim... as she strokes him and whispers in his ear... and leads him for a walk...}
<C>__{the end}
