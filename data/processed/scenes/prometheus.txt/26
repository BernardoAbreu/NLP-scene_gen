<A>__{captain janek, 45, sits at his desk. with his bristling beard and powerful build he has a swashbuckling look, like the captain of a whaling ship. holloway and watts sit on a steel bench in front of him. he sits scanning his orders: a plastic packet with weyland industries logos, cracked open. watermarked papers inside.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{zeta two reticuli was surveyed already. a hundred years ago.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{by an unmanned probe. very crude.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{no earthlike planets.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{so what are you looking for?}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{proof of the engineers' existence.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{confirmation of professor holloway's theories would change everything. there'd be science before holloway and science after.}
<A>__{janek rubs his face wearily with his hands.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{your ticket. i will put the ship where you want. run your scans.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{captain, your crew's been up for a week. we could've used the time. why'd you wait to wake us?}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{better for discipline.}
<P>__{(off their silence)}
<D>__{men ship out as prospectors for one reason: the percentage. find a gold mine or a habitable planet, and you're set for life.}
<P>__{(he laughs bitterly)}
<D>__{but this contract says no percentage. no bounty. just triple pay. the men aren't happy.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{you unhappy too?}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{i'm always unhappy.}
<A>__{he stands. presses his palm against a wall panel. a safe opens. he pulls out a massive pistol in a gunbelt. tosses the orders into the safe. lays the gun atop them and locks it up.}
<C>__{scientists' cabin}
<A>__{holloway and watts take possession of their cabin: a simple but spacious room with twin beds and a window to the stars. they drop duffel bags on the bed. holloway surveys the arrangement. frowns. he releases the magnets that lock the beds down. slides the beds together.}
