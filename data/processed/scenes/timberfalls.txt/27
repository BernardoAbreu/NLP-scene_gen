<L>__{exterior mountains day (2nd unit)}
<A>__{the sun begins to set, basking the mountain range in a magnificent light.}
<L>__{exterior waterfall timber falls trail #2 day}
<A>__{mike and sheryl move right along. still not speaking. the path forks at a beautiful waterfall. mike stops, faces the falls, turns to see... sheryl behind him, catching up. as she does, she slips...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you alright?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<P>__{(balances herself)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{she's about to walk past him, but he reaches for sheryl's hand and holds it.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{do you know how many times i've had someone die on me? how many children? i stopped keeping count.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i thought... i wasn't thinking. what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{get rid of the gun.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what... now? out here?}
<A>__{she holds firm.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i can't just leave it here in the woods, some kid could find it.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{then get rid of the bullets now and when we get home, you get rid of the gun.}
<A>__{mike thinks about it. his instincts screaming not to do this, then...}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{mike relents. he removes his backpack, zips it open. he pulls out the gun, opens it, spills the bullets out. mike with a deep breath, tosses the bullets into the woods.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{was that all of them?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{mike steps back to sheryl, they hug.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{crack! a strange sound, like wood snapping, startles sheryl. mike turns as well. their eyes widen. crack! the figure emerges from the clearing, practically landing on top of them. it's... clyde, a park ranger, mid 50's, friendly. he's got a weed cutter in his hands, wears a pair of work gloves. he's just as surprised to see them. sheryl and mike breath a sigh and offer him a smile.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{oh. didn't mean to startle you folks. just clearing some of the brush off}
<C>__{clyde }
<A>__{the path. we had some heavy rains this past week, knocked some trees and branches down. one of the new recruits was supposed to do yesterday, but... if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself.}
<C>__{mike}
<A>__{it's fine. we were led to believe this trail wasn't regularly patrolled.}
<C>__{clyde}
<A>__{it's not, but... it's one of my favorite spots, so i often find an excuse to swing by.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<A>__{it's gorgeous.}
<C>__{clyde}
<A>__{yup. there are a couple more falls in the park, but none quite so... inviting as this one. now don't take my word for it, you can see for yourself... how long's your stay?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<A>__{just til sunday.}
<C>__{clyde}
<A>__{yeah, no. the other falls are clear on the other side. it would take you a couple nights just to get there.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<A>__{maybe next time.}
<C>__{mike}
<A>__{this is a quickie trip. just getting out of the city for a couple days.}
<C>__{clyde}
<A>__{the city, huh. which? if it's charleston, i wouldn't blame ya. whole place smells like feet. i gotta haul myself all the way down to the hospital there for my yearly because the darn hmo's rules and regulations won't let me visit the local doc. not my cup of tea at all, but if you like it there, then...}
<C>__{sheryl}
<A>__{no, we're not from charleston.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{but apparently we look like we are.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{we live in alexandria. it's just outside of d.c.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{oh. i've been there, few years back. now that city i like. lotta beautiful churches if i recall correctly. which congregation do y'all belong to?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{um... not sure. sheryl keeps track of all that for us. sheryl?}
<A>__{sheryl gives mike the "you're an asshole" look. then...}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{uh... we're between congregations at the moment.}
<A>__{awkward.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{well... i should get back to work. sun'll be down soon and that path ain't gettin'clear on its own.}
<A>__{clyde walks off, until...}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{excuse me... sir?}
<A>__{sheryl doesn't know his name. clyde stops, turns back.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{the name's clyde.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{clyde, would you recommend a nice spot nearby to make camp for the night?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{be happy too... let's see... oh, i got it. "five corners" will be perfect. it's just a bit up the ways here, near the lake. it's five large rocks which sit in a clearing with a view of the whole park. the rocks retain the heat from the day, so if you set up camp between them you won't be so cold.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{sounds perfect.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{just doing my job. you have fun and be careful. good evening.}
<A>__{clyde tips his cap and disappears.}
