<L>__{51 cameron's pov}
<A>__{her features are distorted; they seem to be melting away. she frees her hand and violently tears at her face, pulling away the rubber mask on which is the melting putty and make up. with it goes her wig and what is left is a startlingly beautiful young girl.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{my god!}
<P>__{(choking on water)}
<D>__{you're...i know you...that girl from tv...the actress. nina...}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(sputtering)}
<D>__{...franklin.}
<A>__{the sun glistens on the wet, wild young perfection of her face, ingenuously sparkling laughter and for an instant it's breathtaking a universal boyhood fantasy to suddenly be thrown this close to that kind of "movie star" beauty. it's something cameron feels in the pit of his stomach.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{my god!...why the hell...?}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(laughing and choking)}
<D>__{...makeup test...it's for the film...}
<A>__{regaining his composure enough to attempt flattery, but he means it.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{they gotta be crazy to cover that face.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i'm only old at the end of the story.}
<A>__{as they are only in a few feet of water, there is no longer any reason to hold her. he starts to put her down.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{no, don't do that. rescue me!}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{in three feet of water?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{oh come on, please. i always wanted someone to rescue me from something...}
<A>__{grinning, he carries her toward shore.}
<B>__{angle on beach}
<A>__{eli, surrounded by the crew and dozens of tourists, is standing at the water's edge as cameron wades in and sets nina down.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{nina! you damned near scared me to death!}
<A>__{at the sight of eli, she becomes like a little girl who, having skinned her knee and run to daddy, now can allow herself to cry.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{oh hell, it's all ruined now and i wanted you to see the makeup, eli. where were you?...i even got raymond's autograph and he didn't know...you'd have been proud...}
<A>__{nina is surrounded by people who are rubbing her with towels, taking pictures, all shouting at once. the crowd closes in, excluding cameron to the outskirts.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(to the a.d.)}
<D>__{get her into a tub, then bed...and i want to see her in makeup and costume again before dinner.}
<A>__{three crewmen hustle her off, as she searches the crowd for cameron...then spots him.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{hey! thank you! that was really gallant...rescuing an old lady!}
<A>__{cameron waves and starts to wander off as they whisk nina away.}
