<L>__{interior apartment (room 49) morning}
<A>__{three young guys, obviously in over their heads, sit at a table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out. one of them flips the loud bolt on the door, opening it to reveal jules and vincent in the hallway.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{hey kids.}
<A>__{the two men stroll inside. the three young caught off guard guys are: marvin, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the scene progresses, back into the corner. roger, a young blond haired surfer kid with a "flock of seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand. brett, a white, preppy looking sort with a blow dry haircut. vincent and jules take in the place, with their hands in their pockets. jules is the one who does the talking.}

<C>__{jules}
<D>__{well, if you like hamburgers give 'em a try sometime. me, i can't usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian. which more or less makes me a vegetarian, but i sure love the taste of a good burger.}

<A>__{vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out a black snap briefcase.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{got it.}
<A>__{vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. we can't see what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. vincent just stares at it, transfixed.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{we happy?}
<A>__{no answer from the transfixed vincent.}
<C>__{jules}

<C>__{brett}
<D>__{i just want you to know how sorry we are about how fucked up things got between us and mr. wallace. when we entered into this thing, we only had the best intentions}
<A>__{as brett talks, jules takes out his gun and shoots roger three times in the chest, blowing him out of his chair. vince smiles to himself. jules has got style. brett has just shit his pants. he's not crying or whimpering, but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(to brett)}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. did that break your concentration? i didn't mean to do that. please, continue. i believe you were saying something about "best intentions."}
<A>__{brett can't say a word.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{whatsamatter? oh, you were through anyway. well, let me retort. would you describe for me what marsellus wallace looks like?}
<A>__{brett still can't speak. jules snaps, savagely tipping the card table over, removing the only barrier between himself and brett. brett now sits in a lone chair before jules like a political prisoner in front of an interrogator.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{what country you from!}
<C>__{brett}
<P>__{(petrified)}
<D>__{what?}

<D>__{does he look like a bitch?!}
<C>__{brett}
<P>__{(without thinking)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{jules' eyes go to vincent, vincent smirks, jules rolls his eyes and shoot brett in the shoulder. brett screams, breaking into a shaking trembling spasm in the chair.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{does he look like a bitch?!}
<C>__{brett}
<P>__{(in agony)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{then why did you try to fuck 'im like a bitch?!}
<C>__{brett}
<P>__{(in spasm)}
<D>__{i didn't.}
<A>__{now in a lower voice.}

<D>__{yes ya did brett. ya tried ta fuck 'im. you ever read the bible, brett?}
<C>__{brett}
<P>__{(in spasm)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{there's a passage i got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: ezekiel 25:17. "the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you."}
