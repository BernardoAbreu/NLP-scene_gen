<A>__{wayne puts some scraps of bread into a rough coat which he folds into a makeshift shoulder pack.}
<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{supplies for your journey?}
<A>__{prisoners nearby laugh. wayne moves to the cliff face. the prisoner follows, intrigued by wayne's new demeanor. the tattooed prisoner offers him the rope. wayne refuses. starts to climb. prisoners gather around as word spreads. wayne makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. down below the prisoners start a low chant. as wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something explodes from the cliff face. wayne flinches bats... they circle up to the opening above... wayne closes his eyes. the chant rises. wayne takes a breath...opens his eyes...looks down at the drop...up again...then he jumps. time skips a beat as the prisoners stop breathing. and wayne grabs the ledge above. the prisoners go wild as wayne hoists himself up onto the ledge. the blind prisoner nods. wayne climbs to freedom.}
