<L>__{interior prison cell morning}
<A>__{the cell wall is a clutter of photos: hitler... mussolini... charles manson... and his mother, mrs. shady. a man's muscular naked torso rises into frame, his back to us. he's doing pull ups, his body covered with tattoos! quotes on each arm... "don't have a cow, man!" bart simpson... and "i know you are, but what am i?" pee wee herman. on one shoulder, a gravestone with the epitaph "i told you i was sick!" in the center of his back... we see a big tattoo of ned's face labeled "dead meat." a guard opens the cell door.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{it's time, max.}
<A>__{the prisoner turns. he's butt ugly, hard, nasty looking. it's max shady... with a huge "double corona" cigar in his mouth. on his chest is a tattoo that reads: this space for rent. he walks right toward the camera lens and the frame goes to black.}
