<A>__{close on the water soaked paper impression: the rubbing taken from the shield of the grail knight. brody is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head with an ice pack.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{how's the head?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{it's better, now i've seen this. it's the name of a city. "alexandretta?" hmmm...}
<A>__{indy, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{the knights of the first crusade laid siege to the city of alexandretta for over a year. the entire city was destroyed.}
<A>__{brody lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at indy.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{the present city of iskenderun is built on its ruins. marcus you remember what the grail tablet said. "across the desert and through the mountain to the canyon of the crescent moon."}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but where exactly?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{your father would know. your father did know. look. he made a map.}
<A>__{brody picks up the grail diary.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{he must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the grail quest. a map with no names.}
<A>__{insert: a pencil drawn map it covers two pages of the diary. brody's finger moves across it.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. here. he knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. here. straight to the canyon. he knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(solemnly)}
<D>__{alexandretta. now we know.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{yes. now we know.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{marcus, get hold of sallah. tell him to meet you in iskenderun.}
<A>__{indy closes the grail diary and puts it into the pocket of his robe.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what about you?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i'm going after dad.}
