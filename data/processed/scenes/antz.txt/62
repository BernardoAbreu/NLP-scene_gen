<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior town center day}
<A>__{the huge main chamber of the colony, where most of the workers as well as z, bala, weaver, azteca, and the queen have run to. the chamber is rapidly flooding from all sides. water flows out of every escape tunnel the workers try...and the crowd is becoming more and more closely packed together as the waters rise around them.}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{there's no way out!}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{we're all going to drown!!!}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{z...what can we do?}
<A>__{z clenches his fist...he feels utterly powerless...then he shouts...}
<D>__{zdig!}
<A>__{the workers turn to look at him questioningly.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{we've got to dig a trench around us!}
<A>__{ but one of the workers raises his hands.}
<D>__{worker #1 uh...we don't dig any more. we're individuals. worker #2 yeah. we're too important to dig. you taught us that, z. you hate digging!}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(at his wits end)}
<D>__{yeah, but i hate drowning more! nowdig!}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{you heard the ant dig!!!}
<A>__{the workers start to dig a circular moat around themselves, passing the dirt back into the middle of what remains of the dry ground. but they seems to be making little headway against the water as it continues to rush in... the ant labor we saw up to now were nothing compared to this. as the moat gets deeper, the pile grows higher and higher...weaver is digging up huge chunks of earth...nearby, azteca is digging like crazy too...z runs around, directing traffic and encouraging the workers...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{that's it! pass the dirt back to the center! go on!}
<A>__{nearby the queen stands there, looking squeamish.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{your highness...time to get your hands dirty!}
<A>__{gingerly, the queen reaches out for a clod of dirt...and passes it along. next thing you know, she's practicallycrushed by a huge load thrown up by weaver. the water keeps rushing in...but now we notice that... ...the pile of dirt in the middle of the "island" created by the digging of the moat is growing higher and higher, reaching up towards the ceiling of the chamber... ...and the water is getting swallowed up by the moat, swirling around angrily. now z looks up, and sees that with a little more effort they can reach the top }
<C>__{z}
<D>__{we need to form a scaffolding around this mound let's do it!}
<A>__{the workers start to cluster around the mound, covering it, forming a tight network of living bodies around the mound up towards the ceiling...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{now climb!}
<A>__{the ants start to scale the scaffolding, up towards the top of the chamber...it's a swarming mass of ants, hauling each other up, giving each other legs up, climbing ever and ever higher towards the top... where they start to dig through the very ceiling... ...as, at the bottom of the mound, z starts to organize the hauling away of the queen, as though she were a big cargo container...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{okay boys take her up!}
<A>__{z slaps the queen on the butt, and she's winched away on a cable composed entirely of ants linked arm in arm like those plastic toy monkeys...}
