<A>__{close on hands clasped together a man and a woman's. close on danica' s face, covered in sweat, in the throes of passion. she looks up, eyes glazed pull back to reveal drake, propped above her, thrusting away. danica has her limbs wrapped around drake, holding on for dear life. both are awash in moonlight. the two of them climax. drake withdraws, studying danica. she's naked but for the tiny silver crucifix she wears around her neck. drake nudges the crucifix with his finger.}

<C>__{drake}
<D>__{there's an old saying }
<A>__{drake reaches for the sheet, pulling it away from danica's chest. then he dips his fingertips into her flowing blood painting a long streak of it down between her breasts.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{kill one man, you're a murderer. kill a million, a king.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{kill them all, a god.}
