<L>__{interior sullivan master bedroom night}
<A>__{they are staring at each other. we have seen the woman already she's christy sullivan. but the pictures in the corridor did not do her justice. this is a fabulous looking twenty five year old woman. long, golden hair, a round face that sets off her deep blue eyes, a tanned, curving body. a bare shouldered black dress. an expensive necklace. one more thing: she is staggering drunk. the man is alan richmond, wealthy, successful, handsome and fit. mid forties. he wears an elegantly cut suit. two additional points: (1) richmond is clearly not the husband in the wedding photo. (2) he is drunker than she is. richmond carries a vodka bottle and two tumblers. he fills them, gives one to her. they touch glasses. down the hatch. tight laughter. he looks at her. she looks at him. there's a lot of sexual tension in the air. but now he begins looking around, checking things out. she spots this.}
