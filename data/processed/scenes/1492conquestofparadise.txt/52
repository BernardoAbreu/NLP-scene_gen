<L>__{exterior santa maria deck day}
<A>__{a blazing sun. the ship is like a furnace, its brass fittings too hot to touch, the blistering heat making the air shimmer over the decks. desperate for shade, sailors are sheltering under the sagging prow sail. the ship's boy throws an empty bucket attached to a rope over the side and hauls it back up again, brimming with water. as he turns, we see his face, disfigured by a hair lip. he drenches himself... from the shade, alonso watches him.}
<C>__{alonso}
<D>__{chicken ass face!}
<A>__{the others laugh. the boy, ashamed, tries to ignore them. alonso's hand accidentally touches a brass fitting; he reacts like he was burnt.}
<C>__{alonso}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{he sucks his blistered fingers.}
<C>__{alonso}
<D>__{i never seen heat like this! not even in las minas!}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{the water's going putrid in the barrels.}
<C>__{alonso}
<D>__{you'll be drinking your own piss... for the glory of spain... and admiral colon...! bastard!}
<A>__{the ship's boy glances round at them.}
<C>__{alonso}
<D>__{what are you listening to, chicken ass?}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{ah, leave him alone. he's doing no harm.}
<C>__{alonso}
<D>__{with a face like that?}
<P>__{(to boy)}
<D>__{i don't want you looking at me. you hear?}
<A>__{the boy turns away, dropping the bucket back into the sea.}
<C>__{alonso}
<D>__{he's the devil's child...}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{we'll all go crazy...}
<A>__{the boy throws more water over the deck. a sailor takes his guitar, and starts singing an improvised song.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{culo de galina es el hijo del demonio... (chicken ass mouth is the devil's child... born from the loins}
<P>__{of a stinky old goat etc...)}
<A>__{they all laugh. the boy, hearing this, climbs to the crow's nest like a monkey.}
