<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{sam is at the reigns of the wagon carrying the timber to ford's work area. slaves trudge alongside, same as it ever was. only...it's not quite the same. sam brings the wagon to a halt. he, and the slaves look up the road ahead of them. standing in the middle of the road is a group of chickasaws indians. they are in their "usual" dress of buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic colors, buttoned from belt to chin. they have with them dogs and horses. they carry with them the carcass of a deer. the two groups stare at each other for a long moment.}
