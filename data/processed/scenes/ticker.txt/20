<L>__{exterior bar day}
<A>__{earring walks out and strolls off. he checks his watch, picks up the pace. he disappears around a corner. cars pass. people stroll by. nothing happens. an ordinary scene on an ordinary day. the silence is screaming. suddenly the bar explodes. a fireball bursts out the front window, showering the street with wood and broken glass.}
<L>__{exterior bar day later}
<A>__{chaotic aftermath of the bombing... sirens, flashing red lights. police hold back onlookers, firemen clean up, paramedics carry corpses and moaning victims out of the charred, smoking ruins, into waiting ambulances. a black and white tears up. capt. winters leaps out, pushes through to a dirt covered fire chief.}
<C>__{fire chief}
<D>__{eight dead, so far.}
<A>__{winters looks grim.}
<B>__{at the barricade}
<A>__{reilly screeches up in his studebaker, jumps out, pushes through, flashes his badge, enters the police zone. he stops as he sees a bloody female victim being loaded into an ambulance. suddenly a voice snaps him out of it.}
<C>__{pluchinsky}
<D>__{what're you doing here?}
<A>__{reilly faces him.}
<C>__{pluchinsky }
<D>__{you're offsides. beat it.}
<A>__{reilly ignores them, starts towards the ruins. pluchinsky shoves him back.}
<C>__{pluchinsky }
<D>__{i said get the fuck outta here.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{you touch me again and }
<C>__{pluchinsky}
<D>__{and what, you'll shoot me? hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, i'd like to make retirement in one piece.}
<A>__{pluchinsky starts to laugh as reilly pops him once hard in the face. pluchinsky staggers backwards, grasping his bleeding nose. reilly is ready for more as pluchinsky starts at him. they exchange a few body shots before several cops swarm in and pull them apart. winters hustles over.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{what the hell's going on?}
<C>__{pluchinsky}
<D>__{son of a bitch... my nose... this fuck up is interfering with }
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{reilly, what're you doing here?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{sir...}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{i thought i told you }
<C>__{glass }
<D>__{he's with us.}
<A>__{they all turn. glass and t.j. stand there, soot smeared, wearing utility belts.}
<C>__{glass }
<D>__{we asked him to come.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{hope you don't mind, captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.}
<P>__{(to reilly)}
<D>__{coming?}
<A>__{reilly looks at the captain awkwardly.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{go ahead, kid.}
<A>__{reilly marches after glass and t.j., leaving pluchinsky fuming, holding closed his bloody nose.}
<C>__{pluchinsky}
<D>__{i'm filing charges against that mother }
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{can it, pluchinsky. and shove some cotton up your nose.}
<A>__{angle on the bomb squad reilly follows glass and t.j., bewildered.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{what was ? why...?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{that cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{we've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{let's get something straight. we're doing you a favor. you're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{this isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. you wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{now wait just a fucking }
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. and try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.}
<A>__{reilly glares, tongue tied, as they walk past the bomb squad van and glass' harley, enter the wreckage.}
