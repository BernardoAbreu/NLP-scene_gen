<L>__{interior sydney's bed & breakfast night}
<A>__{sydney wears a stunning black silk evening gown. small greek statues now adorn the room.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i guess i really did need to face it head on in order to see.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{it was courageous.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{girls, are just, i don't know. it's a different energy. they're soft and warm, they can make a guy feel complete.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{and multiple o's. actually, male z's have multiple o's too. been so long i nearly forgot.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{okay, to be honest, i'm relieved you sorted this out. my conscience would have bothered me for decades if we'd just gone ahead without you being certain.}
<A>__{sydney pops a cork and pours herself and luke glasses of champagne. a toast.}
<C>__{sydney }
<D>__{to womanhood!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{to manhood!}
<A>__{they drink.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{so, how does this work?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{we just do it. and, ...it just happens.}
<B>__{at the bed}
<A>__{luke and sydney begin undressing.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{do you like this dress?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{sure. looks great on you. man, dresses! even without everything else, dresses are reason enough right there to stay a guy.}
<A>__{sydney takes this in, considers,...}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{"stay a guy?" let me get this straight. you didn't decide to be a woman?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no. of course not. what?}
<A>__{sydney, realizing her mistake, regroups: plan b.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{just testing you. hold on a moment. there's something i forgot...}
<A>__{she retrieves some rope.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what's that for?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you've never done it with another z. trust me, you need to be tied down.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{does it hurt?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{on the contrary.}
<A>__{bedside table later the alabaster eyes of a small greek statue stares blankly in the direction of the carnal sounds coming from the bed, off}
<B>__{screen...}
<C>__{sydney }
<D>__{just let yourself go completely.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{wow, this is intense.}
<C>__{sydney }
<D>__{when two z's do it, the lateral hypothalamus gets completely overwhelmed,...}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{oh, man!!}
<C>__{sydney }
<D>__{cellular fission kicks in, and, well,... you can go zytusional!}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{unbelievable!}
<A>__{the chiseled eyes of a two foot statue of david, blankly stare.}
<D>__{luke (o.s.) (cont'd) oh no. what's happening?}
<A>__{luke's voice begins rising in pitch...}
<P>__{half luca (o.s.)}
<D>__{what have you done?!}
<P>__{(luca)}
<D>__{nooooo!!!!}
<A>__{the sounds escalate, growing increasingly more intense, culminating in the extraordinary, never before heard,}
<B>__{sound of zytusional climax...}
<P>__{luca luke and sydney (o.s.)}
<D>__{!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}
<A>__{silence. mirror later a great looking, bare chested guy with sydney's hair appears in reflection: male sydney. behind him, still strapped to the bed, is now luca, a gag in her mouth. male sydney carries a phone while fussing with his hair in the mirror.}
<C>__{male sydney}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{i hear you're the best. yes, it's an emergency! please. or i will have to cut it myself.}
<P>__{(to luca)}
<D>__{now, you look me in the eye, and tell me that wasn't the best sex you ever had.}
<A>__{luca moans, struggles violently!}
<C>__{male sydney }
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{half an hour! yes! thank you!}
<A>__{male sydney clicks the phone off.}
<C>__{male sydney }
<D>__{you can have all my clothes. oh, and i just bought these incredible anna felucci pumps.}
<P>__{(reconsiders)}
<D>__{maybe i should keep those.}
<A>__{male sydney returns to dressing, a ribbed tank beneath a gray italian tux.}
<C>__{male sydney }
<D>__{okay, i wasn't completely honest with you, but i never lied either. it stopped. that is what you wanted. you're adulmorphic now. the only way to switch is to do it with another z.}
<A>__{he gazes at luca, a pang of guilt. he sits on the bed, speaks softly.}
<C>__{male sydney }
<D>__{i know you don't believe me, but this is the right thing for you. eventually, you'll figure that on your own. but i could tell it was just gonna' take way too long!}
<A>__{luca stares, distraught.}
<C>__{male sydney }
<D>__{oh, for chris' sake. being a woman doesn't make you any less of a man!}
<A>__{the entire bed lurches back and forth as luca struggles. male sydney winces, pangs of guilt, which turn to anger...}
<C>__{male sydney }
<D>__{damnit! i can't live my whole life wrong 'cause of one stupid mistake! i'm a man! i love havin' this chest, these arms! but most of all,...}
<P>__{(grabs his pant crotch)}
<D>__{welcome home, boys! hang in there, i'm takin' you out for a spin!}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{luca lies alone in the room, bound and gagged on the bed. a knock at the door. luca moans and tries to yell through her gagged mouth. the knock persists.}
<B>__{side window}
<A>__{the ivy parts and keenan peers in. his eyes go wide. he pushes the window open a little, whispers...}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{what's goin' on? where is she?}
<A>__{luca moans and struggles against the ropes.}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{whoa. i guess i really didn't think you were gonna' go this way. okay. whatever.}
<A>__{keenan sits on the edge of the bed. luca moans trying to get keenan to remove the gag.}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{hang on a sec'. look, i'm sorry about earlier, what i said. but all this stuff. janine and i split up.}
<A>__{luca stops struggling, shocked.}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{all i ever did was piss her off. i'm not sure she even wants a guy. and you think i'm so much better with girls than you, and sure i can get laid anytime i want, but truth is, i never even woulda' hit on her if it weren't for watchin' you.}
<A>__{keenan climbs on top of luca, starts untying her hands, straddling her.}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{the way you just talk to 'em about anything, like it was okay. i gotta' get her back, man.}
<A>__{with herculean effort, keenan struggles to hold back tears...}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{it's like the whole world's blown apart. ah, shit. man, you havin' tits now is just weird.}
