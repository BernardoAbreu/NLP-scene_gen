<A>__{bird's eye view of the park. it's all painted gray. every tree, every leaf. there's no sign of life. the camera moves in, through some gray trees and gray brush to:}
<B>__{a lush green oasis camouflaged on the top and sides with gray paint}
<A>__{this place is filled with life: colorful birds, lizards, cats, a rooster. all the animals are active, happy, but totally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their position. lotte and elijah sit among them. these are the animals that she freed earlier. lotte and elijah hold hands and look into each other's eyes. we see that they both wear gold bands. they are husband and wife. elijah signs.}
