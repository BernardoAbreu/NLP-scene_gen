<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{rocky is walking the young girl home... they are presently cutting through a dark public school yard. they pass through the beams of light cast off by weak flood lights located at the top of the school building. the atmosphere is somewhat eerie.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{how come ya wanna hang out with those guys? they teach ya bad things.}
<C>__{marie}

<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{make your teeth yella }
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i like yella teeth.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{makes your breath like garbage.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{maybe i like garbage.}
<A>__{rocky and marie take a shortcut through a dark school yard.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{nobody likes garbage anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{'cause that's the way guys are they laugh when ya talk dirty. they think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out.}
<C>__{rocky }
<D>__{nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. ya get no respect... i gotta use a bad word whore. you'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{c'mon, rocky. i'm twelve.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{that doesn't matter you don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{yo, a bad reputation twenty years from now people will say 'd'you remember marie?' 'no, who was she?' 'she was that little whore who hung out at the atomic hoagie shop.' 'oh, now i remember!'... see, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.}
<A>__{rocky and marie exit the dark school yard... standing in the shadows of the building are three young muggers. the light from their cigarettes flares red in their faces. the muggers pace rocky across the street and follow them down the block... rocky sees them and stops and faces the three. the muggers pause and study rocky from a distance of twenty yards. rocky gives a loud boxer's snort, wipes his nose with the side of his thumb and rolls his shoulders... the muggers are intimidated and slowly peel off the meander away. rocky turns to marie who has been standing behind him.}
<C>__{rocky}
<P>__{(points down the block)}
<D>__{... that's your house, ain't it?}
<A>__{marie nods.}
<C>__{rocky}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{listen, i hope ya don't }
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i won't.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{what was i gonna say?}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{ya hope i don't keep acting like a whore or i will turn into one, right?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{ya, somethin' like that.}
<A>__{they exchange smiles and marie moves away. rocky has made an impact on her life.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{goodnight, rocky.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{'night, marie.}
<A>__{she takes a few more steps and pauses again.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{... fuck you, creepo!!!}
<A>__{the girl runs to her house as rocky looks on in dismay.}
<C>__{rocky}
<P>__{(walks off)}
<D>__{... yeah, who're you to give advice, creepo.}
