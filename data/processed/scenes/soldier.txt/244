<L>__{interior meeting room}
<A>__{nathan wobbles into the meeting room doorway and stops there, staring. the burnt furniture has been heaped in one corner of the room, leaving a large open space where todd, bare chested, a tourniquet on one arm, is squatting on the floor, skillfully reassembling a stripped rifle. surrounding him on the floor in neat piles are the rocket rifles, pistols, ammo clips, utility belts, goggles, torn armor vests, boots, grenades, knives, and flashlights he salvaged from the dead soldiers. todd looks up at nathan and their eyes meet. nathan recognizes his "friend," tries a tentative little smile. but todd just stares at him, and the unformed smile fades from nathan's face. for a long moment they just look each other in the eyes very seriously. sandra enters, her dress covered with the wounded man's blood. not noticing todd, she rushes to nathan, grabs him...}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{nathan, thank god, there you...}
<A>__{suddenly seeing todd she breaks off, stares at him. squatting on the floor, surrounded by weapons, todd's eyes meet hers for a long moment...then he looks away, goes back to assembling the weapons with quick sure movements, almost as if he wanted to avoid her eyes. sandra wets her lips to speak, hesitates, then finally blurts out what she can hardly bear to ask...}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{did he find you?}
<A>__{no answer. todd finishes with the weapon, starts checking the next one.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{my husband...mace...he went out to look for you. he...found you, didn't he?}
<A>__{todd looks up at her and nods. their eyes lock.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{they...killed him...didn't they?}
<A>__{todd nods, turns back to his arsenal. sandra stands there, hugging nathan to her chest, holding her tears in, her lids quivering, fighting to conquer her emotion. after a long, difficult moment, she wins the battle with herself. she looks numb, stunned, but she's not crying. todd has begun to dress. he straps a sheath knife to one ankle, pulls on boots. then he pulls a jersey over his muscular torso, covering all the old scars, the tattooed names of battles, and the tourniquet on his arm. staring at him with glazed eyes, sandra notices a blotch of blood form on the jersey, leaking through the tourniquet. she speaks numbly.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{your wound...it's still bleeding.}
<A>__{stuffing his pockets with ammo and other items, todd glances at her with eyes that glitter dangerously.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i like to bleed, sir.}
<A>__{sandra stares at him stupidly as he continues to dress, pulling on a heavy armored vest.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{it doesn't...hurt?}
<A>__{todd pulls on a second armored vast, one that already has a ragged hole in it from a rocket.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{not enough, sir.}
<A>__{sandra watches him go to the heap of charred furniture in the corner and take a blackened stick from it, watches him smear charcoal under his eyes.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{how do you know they'll come back?}
<A>__{todd looks at her, a savage with blackened eyes.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{they're soldiers, sir. like me.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{what...what do they want?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{nothing?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{they are obeying orders, sir. it's their duty.}
<A>__{for a moment sandra is silent, then...}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{you know who they are, don't you? do you know how many there'll be?}
<A>__{todd crosses two utility belts across his armored chest like bandoliers.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{seventeen more, sir.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{seventeen! my god!}
<P>__{(suddenly energized)}
<D>__{you can't fight seventeen yourself! you have to organize the rest of us, show us what to do. we don't have your...your skills...but we're not cowards. we'll do what you tell us, we'll }
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(interrupting, softly)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{his voice is soft as silk but hard as steel. she looks into his eyes. does she detect a hint of approval, of respect, in those flat expressionless snake eyes?}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{todd turns to go, laden with weapons, a flamethrower on his back, a rocket rifle on his shoulder, another in one hand.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{soldiers deserve soldiers, sir.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{but...one soldier against seventeen!}
<A>__{he looks back at her, right into her eyes this time.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i am going to kill them all, sir.}
