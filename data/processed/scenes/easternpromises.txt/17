<D>__{the tables are set for a huge party. kirill is now on step ladders, fixing some christmas decorations. other relatives are getting the place ready. semyon hurries through the restaurant, leading anna by the hand.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{we must hurry. i must stir. stir, stir or the gravy dies in my hands. today it is family. here is my son, kirill.}
<P>__{(he hisses at kirill)}
<D>__{kirill! the berries are too low, too low. and roman, more glasses for red!}
<P>__{(he claps his hands)}
<D>__{come on! kirill follows anna's progress through the restaurant with a glare. there are three little girls in extravagant party frocks, all holding violins and giggling near to the door that leads to the kitchen. semyon stops when he reaches them and puts his hands on his hips.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{my angels. you should be practising. you must make the wood cry. like this, like this... semyon grabs a violin and plays a three second burst of sad russian violin music.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{you see... semyon hurries on into the kitchen. anna smiles, delighted at the eccentric old man.}
