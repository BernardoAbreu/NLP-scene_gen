<A>__{bill peeks out the window, careful not to be seen by the diseased humans around grant's. bill can see starla in the home next door, walking up the stairs. bill runs toward the stairwell here.}
<L>__{interior grant upstairs hallway night}
<A>__{starla looks down the hall. most of the walls have been torn away. between wooden beams, starla can see grant's cumbersome mass, his back to her, in what was once the bedroom. in front of him, the song ends on the cd player. it starts into the next song on the album. grant uses one of his crusty tentacles to push the back button. every woman in the world starts over. starla walks toward him.}
