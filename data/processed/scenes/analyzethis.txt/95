<D>__{let me cut to the chase. sometime in the next week or so, the heads of every major crime family in the united states are going to meet together somewhere in the new york area.}
<A>__{ben nods, finally understanding vitti's two week deadline.}
<C>__{agent provano}
<D>__{we think the stage is set for a major bloodbath. has he mentioned anything about it to you?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{a bloodbath?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no. if he said anything about a bloodbath, i probably would've remembered it. bloodbath is one of those words that, you know, stands out in a conversation.}
<C>__{agent steadman}
<P>__{(gathering photos)}
<D>__{you could really help us out by supplying information about that meeting.}
<C>__{ben}

<C>__{agent steadman}

<D>__{there's going to be a bloodbath. oh, yeah. only it's going to be between you and me. you think you can break into our home and intimidate us? that ain't the way it works here, boys. whatever he and paul vitti talked about is privileged. he doesn't have to tell you a thing.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{tarasoff vs. the university of california. look it up. now, if he's done something wrong, take him downtown and book him. otherwise, i will ask you very kindly to get the hell out of my house.}
<C>__{agent steadman}

<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(impressed)}
