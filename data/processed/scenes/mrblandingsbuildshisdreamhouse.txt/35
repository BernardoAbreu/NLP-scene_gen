<A>__{jim, muriel and mr. smith they are driving through a beautiful connecticut countryside. mr. smith, a local real estate dealer, is of that shrewd yankee breed which specializes in the understatement, underselling school of salesmanship.}
<C>__{bill's voice}
<D>__{there they are, two little fish from new york out in the deep deep waters of connecticut real estate. that's smith, the real estate salesman. mighty shrewd cookie in a quiet sort of way. never thought he'd get a bite this quick.}
<A>__{smith looks speculatively at the blandings.}
<C>__{bill's voice}
<D>__{now he's sizing up the catch. "mm. let's see. convertible orchids must be pretty well fixed. wonder if they're lookers or buyers?"}
<A>__{jim takes a deep breath, looks at muriel as if to say, "get that air!" muriel smiles with approval. jim pats her hand affectionately. smith reacts.}
<C>__{bill's voice}
<D>__{they're buyers.}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{yes, sir, smith, looks like you're finally going to unload the old hackett place. now first thing is get 'em a little anxious.}
<A>__{jim slows down the car as they approach a rather picturesque looking old connecticut farmhouse. he and muriel react with approval, look questioningly at smith. smith shakes his head, "no," as though to say, "not nearly good enough for you."}
<C>__{bill's voice}
<D>__{th a a t's right!}
