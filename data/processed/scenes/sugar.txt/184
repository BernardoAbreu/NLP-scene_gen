<L>__{interior laundromat night}
<A>__{miguel leans against the counter, staring at his clothes twirling in the dryer, when... ...he notices raquel unloading her clothes a few dryers away. she pushes her laundry cart to the opposite side of his counter, begins folding. miguel stares at her out of the corner of his eye, taking special notice of her diverse underwear collection ranging from lacy thongs to the standard cotton variety. she catches him peeking.}

<D>__{you just going to watch or you going to help me out?}
<A>__{caught off guard, miguel smiles awkwardly, turns away. after a few beats, a flying sock lands on his shoulder. he turns back to find several random items of her clothing on the counter in front of him. she smiles, keeps folding. miguel sorts through the items: socks, underwear, t shirts. he looks back to her, then begins folding, as the laundromat's machinery reverberates around them. they exchange brief grins.}
