<L>__{interior death star forward bay command office}
<A>__{in a very small command office near the entrance to the pirateship, a gantry officer looks out his window and notices the guards are missing. he speaks into the comlink.}
<C>__{gantry officer}
<D>__{tx four one two. why aren't you at your post? tx four one two, do you copy?}
<A>__{a stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating his comlink is not working. the gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed look.}
<C>__{gantry officer}
<D>__{take over. we've got a bad transmitter. i will see what i can do.}
<A>__{as the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing the towering chewbacca. the gantry officer, in a momentary state of shock, stumbles backward. with a bone chilling howl, the giant wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. the aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by han, dressed as an imperial stormtrooper. ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by luke, also dressed as a stormtrooper. luke quickly removes his helmet.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{bring them on! i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{we found the computer outlet, sir.}
<A>__{ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city appears on the monitor. he begins to inspect it carefully. threepio and artoo look over the control panel. artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{plug in. he should be able to interpret the entire imperial computer network.}
<A>__{artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information to the little robot. after a few moments, he beeps something.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{he says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. he'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.}
<A>__{the computer monitor flashes readouts.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. a power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.}
<A>__{ben studies the data on the monitor readout.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i don't think you boys can help. i must go alone.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{whatever you say. i've done more that i bargained for on this trip already.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i want to go with you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{be patient, luke. stay and watch over the droids.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but he can...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{they must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as alderaan. your destiny lies along a different path than mine. the force will be with you... always!}
<A>__{ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey hallway. chewbacca barks a comment and han shakes his head in agreement.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{boy you said it, chewie.}
<A>__{han looks at luke.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{where did you dig up that old fossil?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{ben is a great man.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{yeah, great at getting us into trouble.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i didn't hear you give any ideas...}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{who do you think...}
<A>__{suddenly artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak. luke goes over to him.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{i'm afraid i'm not quite sure, sir. he says "i found her", and keeps repeating, "she's here."}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, who... who has he found?}
<A>__{artoo whistles a frantic reply.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{princess leia.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{the princess? she's here?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{princess? what's going on?}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{level five. detention block a a twenty three. i'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, no! we've got to do something.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{the droid belongs to her. she's the one in the message... we've got to help her.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{now, look, don't get any funny ideas. the old man wants us to wait right here.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but he didn't know she was here. look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i'm not going anywhere.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{they're going to execute her. look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. now all you want to do is stay.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{marching into the detention area is not what i had in mind.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but they're going to kill her!}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{better her than me...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{she's rich.}
<A>__{chewbacca growls.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{rich?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yes. rich, powerful! listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well more wealth that you can imagine.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i don't know, i can imagine quite a bit!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you'll get it!}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i better!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you will...}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{all right, kid. but you'd better be right about this.}
<A>__{han looks at chewie, who grunts a short grunt.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{what's your plan?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{uh... threepio, hand me those binders there will you?}
<A>__{luke moves toward chewbacca with electronic cuffs.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{okay. now, i'm going to put these on you.}
<A>__{chewie lets out a hideous growl.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{okay. han, you put these on.}
<A>__{luke sheepishly hands the binders to han.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{don't worry, chewie. i think i know what he has in mind.}
<A>__{the wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as han binds him with the electronic cuffs.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{master luke, sir! pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should artoo and i do if we're discovered here?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{lock the door!}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{and hope they don't have blasters.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{that isn't very reassuring.}
<A>__{luke and han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant imperial death star.}
