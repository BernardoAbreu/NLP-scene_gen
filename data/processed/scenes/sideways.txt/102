<L>__{exterior bucolic road day}
<A>__{miles has returned to where he hit the dog. just then, miles notices two mexican children watching him from just down the road. they disappear into the bushes. looking like a criminal, miles trots back to the saab climbs behind the wheel and speeds away.}
<L>__{exterior windmill inn day}
<A>__{the saab pulls into the parking lot.}
<L>__{exterior interior motel room day}
<A>__{miles trudges up the stops to the room. he opens the door and sees }
<B>__{jack}
<A>__{atop stephanie, plowing her fertile fields. despite the interruption, their pace does not alter.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{not now! not now!}
<A>__{miles quickly shuts the door.}
<L>__{interior windmill sports bar lounge day}
<A>__{miles pours himself another glass of pinot. jack comes in and spots his morose friend.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, there you are.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what're you drinking?}
<A>__{jack reaches over to check out the bottle's label. miles remains cool to jack's amiability.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{any good?}
<A>__{miles shrugs.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to the bartender)}
<D>__{could i get a glass please?}
<P>__{(to miles)}
<D>__{stephanie took me out into the pinot fields today. it was awesome. i think i finally got a handle on the whole process, from the soil to the vine to the what do you call it? selection and harvest. and the whole, you know, big containers where they mix it. we even ate pinot grapes right off the vine.}
<P>__{(the new expert)}
<D>__{still a little sour but already showing potential for great structure. stephanie really knows her shit, miles.}
<A>__{jack now has his glass and pours himself some wine.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{where is stephanie?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{upstairs. getting cleaned up.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{with this chick.}
<A>__{jack just looks at him.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{does she know about saturday?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{um... not exactly. but i've been honest. i haven't told her i'm available. and she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. besides...}
<A>__{jack stops short in a rare instance of self censorship.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{besides what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well... i don't know, just... the wedding.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, i've been doing some thinking.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{oh, you've been thinking. and?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i may have to put the wedding on hold is all.}
<A>__{miles looks at him with incredulity.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i fully realize that making a change like that might be tricky for certain people to accept at first, but life is short, miles. i've got to be sure i'm doing the right thing before taking such a big step. and not just for my sake. i'm thinking about christine's feelings too. i take marriage very seriously always have. that's why i've never done it before. the day i get married, it's going to be the real thing.}
<A>__{miles just looks at his friend, waiting for more.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{being with stephanie has opened my eyes. she's not uptight or controlling. she's just cool. things are so easy with her. smells different. tastes different. fucks different. fucks like an animal. i'm telling you, i went deep last night, miles. deep.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{deep.}
<A>__{miles draws a long sigh.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't get all judgmental on me. this is my deal. it's my life, and it's my call.}
<A>__{they fall silent for a moment. then }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i was hoping to get some understanding from you. and i'm not getting it.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{understanding of what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{like i might be in love with another woman.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{in love? twenty four hours with some wine pourer chick and you think you're in love? and give up everything?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look who's talking. you've been there.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yes i have, and do i look like a happy man? was all that drama with brenda a happy thing for me to do? huh? was it? is she a part of my life now?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this is totally different. i'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. that's the distinction. i have not made the commitment yet. i am not married. i have not said the words. in a few days, i might get married, and if i do, then i won't be doing stuff like this anymore. otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and what about stephanie? she's a woman with a kid. a single mom. what do you think she's looking for? huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{here's what i'm thinking. we move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. you design your own wine; i will handle the business side. then you get inspired and write a new novel. as for me, if an audition comes along, hell, la's two hours away. not even.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you're crazy. you've gone crazy.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what do you care anyway? you don't even like christine.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what? of course i like christine.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you said she was shallow. yeah, and a nouveau riche.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{that was three years ago after that first party!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look, miles, all i know is i'm an actor. all i have is my instinct.}
<P>__{(his hand on his chest)}
<D>__{my intuition that's all i have. and you're asking me to go against it. and that's just wrong.}
<A>__{just then stephanie walks in. she cozies up to jack, and he kisses the top of her head.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{hi, guys. we should probably get going.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{where?}
