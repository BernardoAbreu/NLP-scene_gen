<L>__{interior betts's bathroom night}
<A>__{betts lies slumped in her bathtub, her hair matted and damp, her eyes open and staring. her mouth begins to work in a very sensual way, and she begins to drool slightly. the tub is completely empty now except for the scum of blood and soap. the smashed glass is scattered all over the floor near the base of the tub. zombie like, betts rises from the tub and steps out on to the floor, her feet missing the bathmat. the crunch and snap of her bare feet on the broken glass are heightened abnormally by the tiled echo chamber of the bathroom. the steps betts takes toward the medicine cabinet leave bloody prints on the floor. betts takes out various bottles and plastic cases and tubes from the medicine cabinet and begins to apply make up to her face with mechanical precision.}
