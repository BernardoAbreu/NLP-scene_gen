<L>__{exterior hollywood sign night}
<A>__{marius stands in the hills by the hollywood sign, gazing down, his brow furrowed, at lestat's fortress like mansion hidden in the canyon below. the wind blows the trees, bushes. marius turns, uneasy, sensing something, peers into the shadows cast by the brightly lit sign. marius stares as a figure emerges from the shadows. it is mael, a vampire, his face hidden in a cloak.}
<C>__{mael}
<D>__{marius, you've broken your oath. you were to watch over akasha and khayman. you are a great disappointment to me.}
<A>__{marius looks up to see all the ancients now stepping from the shadows. khayman, the desert vampire, in egyptian dress along with pandora, the dark haired beauty in her sari, armand, the boy sage, in his mesopotamian robes. last, maharet steps from her grand door. she is beautiful with long red hair, alabaster skin.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{pandora, armand, it's been a long time. khayman, maharet, to what do i owe this honor?}
<C>__{khayman}
<D>__{you have been summoned because of your errant child...}
<A>__{khayman crosses to the edge, peers menacingly into the distance at lestat's house.}
<C>__{pandora}
<P>__{(giving deep, sexy laugh)}
<D>__{he's quite the devil, isn't he?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{his music mocks us, pandora!}
<C>__{pandora}
<D>__{his music moves my blood.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{keep your amorous thoughts to yourself. his music is a threat to all vampires. we will let the covens dismember him at his concert.}
<C>__{mael}
<D>__{yes. it will set an example.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{i don't see how this solves things. this isn't thought through.}
<C>__{khayman}
<D>__{marius, we understand your affection for lestat, but your duty is to us!}
<A>__{he gazes again down at lestat's house with a threatening glance. turns to marius with a look of warning.}
<C>__{khayman}
<D>__{we could always get rid of him right now.}
<C>__{mael}
<D>__{no. we will contact the covens. let them know we condone the slaying. it will be better for all to see.}
<A>__{marius, with a tortured expression, gazes at mael. maharet steps up.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{wait. never mind lestat! we have greater problems...}
<C>__{marius}
<P>__{(stepping up)}
<D>__{maharet is right. it is akasha we face now.}
<C>__{pandora}
<P>__{(joyous)}
<D>__{is it true, maharet? has our queen really risen!}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{don't be so happy, pandora. i knew akasha when she walked this earth. i was her slave. i am now her enemy. i know what she is capable of.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{yes. we've all felt her presence, even as she hides from us.}
<P>__{(as others nod,}
<D>__{acknowledging the}
<P>__{truth of this)}
<D>__{what does she want now?}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{she knows only one thing. taking pleasure in destroying life. she is already killing the young ones to build her strength.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{she's sucked the life out of her king like a praying mantis. i sense she is getting closer.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{she has come to destroy lestat, but he will only whet her thirst more...}
<A>__{the ancients look to each other, taking this in. pandora looks around, suddenly nervous.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{if we act together, we have a chance to destroy her.}
<A>__{they all gaze at maharet, astonished.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{yes! we must destroy her immediately! if she is not stopped, i'm afraid of what will happen to the entire mortal world.}
<C>__{mael}
<D>__{but can she be destroyed? i am left to bear the scars of the last attempt on her life. she was dragged into the sun. she survived. but we almost didn't...}
<A>__{removing his hood, we see his terribly burned face. they all stare at him.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{what happens to our queen happens to us. if akasha dies, we die as well.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{then so be it! we must take that chance.}
<A>__{she gazes at them all intensely, as the meaning of her words sink in.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{we must destroy akasha. for the sake of humanity! we must find her. now!}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{but perhaps she has come to kill lestat and then will go back to her slumber. that is our only hope.}
<C>__{pandora}
<P>__{(eager)}
<D>__{yes. that's right. she and the covens will take care of that brat. we must go to the concert and pay our respects to our great queen.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{how? with your own throat! you've all been asleep too long! you're still dreaming.}
<A>__{marius steps up beside maharet.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{maharet speaks the truth. it is our only hope.}
<A>__{marius then goes and stands beside maharet and khayman. the others gaze at the three standing together now.}
<C>__{mael}
<D>__{no. armand is right. we will go to the concert and first see what she does. there may be no need for action.}
<A>__{pandora and armand nod their assent. the two groups face each other. maharet gazes at their faces, spits out the words.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{then you go to the concert and you shall see!}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{and i thought the ancients became wise with their years.}
<A>__{as we remain on the ancient ones, akasha's heartbeat creeps back in over... marius gazes again down at lestat's house, anguish on his face.}
