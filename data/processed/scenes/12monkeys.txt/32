<L>__{interior dormitory (psych ward) county hospital night}
<A>__{cole's eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight. he's lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward. disoriented. which world is this? the room is full of breathing, snoring, occasional moans. he can barely discern the shadowy figures of an orderly and a nurse, making their rounds, checking each bed. his eyes adjusting to the darkness, cole watches them exit. he turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window. with a quick glance at the sleeping patients, he slips out of bed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out. cole's pov: the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a single tree. under the tree, in silhouette, a couple embraces, kisses. angle on cole, looking out the window, absorbed.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{it won't work. you can't open it.}
<A>__{alarmed, cole turns, sees jeffrey in the next bed.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{you think you can remove the grill but you can't. it's welded.}
<A>__{cole checks the grill anyway.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{see? i toldja. and all the doors are locked, too. they're protecting the people on the outside from us. but the people outside are as crazy as us.}
<A>__{cole has become preoccupied with a small spider creeping along the window sill. he's staring at it when he's distracted by a sudden sound. grabbing the spider, cole scrambles back into bed just as the door opens and an orderly probes the dark room with the blade of his flashlight. angle on cole, in bed, feigning sleep. the flashlight clicks off and cole hears the door close. for a long moment the ward is silent except for breathing, snores, occasional moans. then, cole hears jeffrey's hoarse whisper, picking up right where he left off.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{you know what "crazy" is? "crazy" is "majority rules". take germs for example.}
<A>__{although cole is preoccupied with the spider struggling to get out of his fist, he can't help reacting to the word, "germs"!}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{germs?!}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{in the 18th century there was no such thing! nobody'd ever imagined such a thing no sane person anyway. along comes this doctor...semmelweiss, i think. he tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick! he's trying to get doctors to wash their hands. what is this guy...crazy? teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!}
<A>__{as jeffrey warms to his subject, getting excited, cole tries to figure out where to put the spider.}
<C>__{jeffrey }
<D>__{so cut to the 20th century! last week in fact, right before i got dragged into this hellhole. i order a burger in this fast food jointerior the waiter drops it on the floor. he picks it up, wipes it off, hands it to me...like it was all okay.}
<A>__{no alternative. cole pops the spider in his mouth and swallows it as jeffrey prattles on...}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{"what about the germs?" i say. he goes, "i don't believe in germs. germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" now, he's crazy, right? hey, you believe in germs, don't you?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i'm not crazy.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{of course not, i never thought you were. you want to escape, right? that's very sane. i can help you. you want me to, don't you? get you out?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{if you know how to escape, why don't you...?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{why don't i escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right? 'cause i'd be crazy to escape! i'm all taken care of, see? i've sent out word.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{what's that mean?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{i've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. when he learns i'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. like a guest! like a person! sheets! towels! like a big hotel with great drugs for the nut case lunatic maniac devils...}
<A>__{patients are waking up as the nurse and two orderlies burst into the dorm and head straight for jeffrey who's struggling to calm himself.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{sorry. really sorry. got a little agitated. the thought of escaping crossed my mind and suddenly...suddenly i felt like bending the fucking bars back, ripping off the goddamn window frames and...eating them, yes, eating them, and leaping, leaping...}
<A>__{cole watches the orderlies grab jeffrey and haul him away.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{you dumb assholes! i'm a mental patient! i'm supposed to act out. wait til you morons find out who i am. my father's gonna be really upset. and when my father gets upset, the ground shakes! my father is god! i worship my father.}
