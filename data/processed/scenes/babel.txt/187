<D>__{amelia smokes, drifting. after a while she sits on a sidewalk and leans on a post. she looks into the street at the people passing by and starts crying softly. a dusty and battered pick up truck arrives. inside are her son and her comadre. her son steps down and hugs her in silence as she cries. her comadre observes them from a distance.}
<L>__{exterior hamlet evening}
<D>__{the truck is parked in front of anwar's house. richard and susan wait in the back while the boy, anwar and the vet lean on the hood. suddenly a helicopter with american insignia flies over them and goes to land in an empty lot. anwar looks up and watches the helicopter descend. the helicopter kicks up a cloud of dust before the stunned gaze of dozens of children. some camels are frightened. some starving dogs bark at it.}
