<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{think he's inside?}
<A>__{bill takes the lead, carefully approaching the barn. the posse follows, their weapons drawn. the closer they get to the barn, the more unbearable the smell becomes. only bill, intent on the task in front of him, doesn't react to the stench at all. bill leans his ear in close to the front door, and listens. through the door he can hear a quiet sobbing. bill and wally exchange a look. bill steps back. he and wally aim their shotguns at the door. bill nods to margaret, and gestures for her to open it. starla watches all this from the rear. margaret swings open the door.}
