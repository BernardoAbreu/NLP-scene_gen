<L>__{exterior ice channel day}
<A>__{(scene 1750 eret's turn) drago's massive flagship leads the flotilla, pulled along forcefully by whatever's at the other end of the enormous chain. drago whacks the chain with his bullhook, spurring it forward. on drago's ship eret, astrid, and the gang are escorted to the stern, surrounded by several of drago's soldiers. wrists bound. spear tips pressed into their backs.}
<C>__{snotlout}
<D>__{could this day get any worse?}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{uh, let me see. you'll jump into freezing cold water and then die from drowning.}
<A>__{they reach the gang plank. eret peers overboard at the deep, icy water below.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{looks refreshing.}
<A>__{he turns to astrid, meeting her glare with mock chivalry.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{please, ladies first.}
<A>__{a pair of soldiers grab astrid by the arms.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{you are a steaming heap of dragon }
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{ duck.}
<A>__{eret whirls around, round housing both soldiers. they go down, heavily. he catches one of their spears with his bound hands and slices his ropes free. they fall away as he catches the other spear, twirling both in invitation.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{warn the others!}
<A>__{one soldier runs to send up the alarm... while the last two raise blow dart tubes. eret swipes the first off of his legs, sending the dart into the neck of the second.}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{get `em, you son of an eret!}
<A>__{as the downed soldiers scramble to their feet, fishlegs falls over, crushing them under his weight. eret catches the falling tube from the second soldier and blows the dart at the fleeing third. the soldier drops, unconscious just shy of the captain's quarters.}
<C>__{ruffnut }
<D>__{okay, i love you again.}
<A>__{ruffnut skips past snotlout on her way to eret. snotlout watches, crestfallen.}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{ugh. pathetic. you can still jump.}
<A>__{eret avoids ruffnut and turns to astrid.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{so? are we going to save your dragons and get out of here or not?}
<A>__{astrid narrows her eyes, not knowing what to make of him. he reclaims his sword and dagger from the unconscious soldier who took them and cuts tuffnut free.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{check every trap. they're here somewhere.}
