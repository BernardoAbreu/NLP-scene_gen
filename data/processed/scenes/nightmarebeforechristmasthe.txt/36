<A>__{the evil scientist is at his lab table, peering into a microscope and thinking which, for him, involves lifting off the top of his skull and tickling and scrambling the brains inside. sally carries in a tray holding his bowl of soup.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{lunch.}
<A>__{the scientist impatiently gestures her over. he replaces the top of his skull...}
<C>__{evil scientist}
<D>__{excellent. over here. over here. set it down.}
<A>__{she gingerly sets the tray in front of him. the scientist inhales a deep sniff of the steam curling off the soup.}
<C>__{evil scientist}
<D>__{ah... what's that?... worm's wart!}
<A>__{he glances suspiciously at sally.}
<C>__{evil scientist}
<D>__{what trail are you trying to throw me off now?}

<P>__{(acts all hurt)}
<D>__{what's wrong? i spent all morning on that soup. i thought you liked worm's wart.}
<C>__{evil scientist}
<D>__{there's nothing more suspicious than worm's wart it distracts one from every other taste and smell.}

<C>__{evil scientist}
<D>__{until you taste it, i won't eat a bite.}
<A>__{sally crumples.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{but i have to go out. something's happening out there.}

<D>__{can't you make other creations?}
<C>__{evil scientist}
<D>__{i could. of course i could. but no one would be like you...}
<P>__{(pours it on again)}
<D>__{i will never understand how you can be so cold hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like }
