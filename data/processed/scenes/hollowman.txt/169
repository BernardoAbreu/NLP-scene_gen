<L>__{interior corridor day}
<A>__{matt makes his way forward.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{he probably just stopped moving.}
<A>__{but matt becomes more cautious with his footsteps. slowly ... approaching a corner... he rounds the corner and sees a heat signature at the far end of the corridor. he levels his pistol, ready to fire.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{it's me.}
<A>__{matt pulls off his goggles.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{do you have anything?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{how did he get by us?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{he couldn't.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{sebastian! we're here to help. sebastian.}
<A>__{no response. they both don their visors and move forward slightly. carter holds up his hand.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{there. behind those pipes. he's not moving.}
<A>__{carter points. matt checks his thermal. a red heat signature clings to the wall.}
<C>__{carter }
<D>__{doctor caine?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can you hear me?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(into walkie)}
<D>__{we see him. but he's not responding. the heat signature doesn't move.}
<A>__{matt looks through his visor and holds the tranquilizer gun at the ready. he looks for a clear shot. the heat signature huddles behind pipes.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{c'mon... c'mon...}
<A>__{the two slowly move closer. matt finally has a clear shot. he signals carter. carter levels his pistol too.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{covered.}
<A>__{matt fires the dart at the heat signature. it bounces off the wall ... nothing there.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what the...}
<A>__{he crosses to the heat signature.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{just a vent. just a goddamn vent}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{he was there.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{looks like... looks like we're pumping out heat...}
<A>__{suddenly behind him... carter jerks three feet in the air, kicking wildly. suspended in mid air by his neck. he gasps for air.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{i got movement again! he's right on top of you!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no fucking shit!}
<A>__{matt opens fire with the tranquilize, shooting at the ceiling until he spends his dart rounds.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{sebastian? goddamnit! let him go.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(choking)}
<D>__{h...help... mmmmphg}
<A>__{carter suffocates. he passes out. with a sudden crack, he's thrown against the side wall. a large cut opens up across his head and his body goes limp.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(into walkie)}
<D>__{where is he? where the fuck is he?!?}
