<L>__{int st. peter's basilica night}
<A>__{the camerlengo comes out of a doorway and into st. peter's basilica. he heads for the main doors just as half a dozen swiss guard step in from outside, blocking his way. some murmur softly into their radios. he stops, turns around to come back the way he came but two swiss guard appear in that doorway, also with radios. he turns again, no way to go but toward the front of the basilica. he sees the candlelit balustrade near the front, the one that leads to the grottoes and the necropolis. he picks up his pace. the swiss guard follow, at a slight distance. the camerlengo reaches the spiral staircase and stops, looking down, seeing the oil lamp he kicked over earlier. he thinks. he picks up a fresh lamp, holds it to his face and blows out its flame with a soft puff. across the basilica, we're with the swiss guard as they walk slowly toward him. but they hear a cry from ahead, he's gone down the stairs a short distance, and they can hear the sound of liquid sloshing. they break into a run as they realize what he's about to do, they're twenty feet away, then ten, then just close enough to see the camerlengo as he smashes a burning oil lamp at his feet. the flames leap onto his oil soaked clothes and he ignites in a pillar of white flame.}
