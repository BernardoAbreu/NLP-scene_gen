<L>__{exterior castle night}
<A>__{the princess sees the burning off in the distance, like a bonfire. she stands on the wall, looking out at it. and then she sees, on a hillside, silhouetted against the night and the fire, a rider, just sitting there on his horse, looking at the castle. she runs into the castle, up the stairs, and stands on the pinnacle of the castle, so that she too is silhouetted, and he can see her. the lone rider is william wallace. close a candle being placed in a window of the stable cottage, built into the outer wall of the castle. at a distance, the candle burns like a tiny beacon. and william sees it. inside the stable cottage, the princess sits alone, wondering if her signal is going to work.}
<B>__{outside the castle}
<A>__{wallace climbs the castle wall, hand over hand up the mortared stones, to the window twenty feet above the ground. he reaches the safety of the window cove and kneels on the ledge. he looks through the window, and sees her inside. inside the room, she looks up, and sees him there. the first glance frightens her, and yet she expected him, prayed for him to come. now, for a long, long moment the two of them look at each other through the glass, each realizing the implications of this moment. she moves to the window and opens it. the wind rushing through extinguishes the candle, and he slips inside. they face each other in the darkness. then she strikes a match and relights the candle, and they look at each other.}

<D>__{i am much diminished since we met.}

<C>__{william}
<D>__{no. stop. i didn't come here for that.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{then why did you come?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{why did you?}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{because of the way you're looking at me now. the same way... as when we met.}
<A>__{he turns his face away. gently, she pulls it back.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{i know. you looked at me... and saw her.}
<A>__{he twists back toward the window.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{you must forgive me what i feel. no man has ever looked at me as you did.}
<A>__{surprised, he looks at her now.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{you have... you have a husband.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{i have taken vows. more than one. i've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. and i cannot keep both promises.}
<A>__{slowly, it starts to dawn on him what she's asking, and an unexpected smile plays at his lips. her smile lights too.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{you understand. consider, before you laugh and say no. you will never own a throne, though you deserve one. but just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule england. and what if his veins ran not with the blood of longshanks, but with that of a true king?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i cannot love you for the sake of revenge.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{no. but can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? or simply love me... because i love you?}
<A>__{slowly, he reaches to the candle flame, and pinches it out.}
<B>__{in the shadows of the cottage bed}
<A>__{we see the surging, pent up passion... and}
