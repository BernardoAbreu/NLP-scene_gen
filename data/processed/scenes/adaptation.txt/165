<L>__{exterior swamp day}
<A>__{the sun is hot. laroche is twenty feet ahead of orlean. she watches him march forward with great authority. she massages her eyebrows, leaving a residue of dirt on her face.}
<L>__{interior hotel room night}
<A>__{kaufman reviews his notes. he is sweaty and wild eyed.}
<C>__{kaufman }
<D>__{i have nothing. i am nothing. i am fat. i am over. i am lost.}
<L>__{exterior swamp later}
<A>__{the sun is high. orlean and laroche sit on dry ground. she stares at him. laroche won't look at her. he busies himself opening the backpack and pulling out food. finally, laroche speaks without looking up.}
<C>__{laroche}
<D>__{we're not lost.}
<A>__{laroche takes out a cigarette, lights it.}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{i'm just turned around a little.}
<A>__{he looks up at her, sees her staring at him. he pokes around on the ground for something, comes up with a straight twig.}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{a sundial. i will just set this up, wait a few minutes, and we'll be able to tell which way the sun is moving. we want to be heading southeast.}
<A>__{laroche sticks the twig into the ground, stares at it.}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{this is no big deal. you should eat something.}
<A>__{orlean takes a cracker. this relaxes laroche. he stretches his legs, knocks over the twig. without looking at orlean, he puts the twig back.}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{so do you collect anything?}
<C>__{orlean}
<P>__{(non responsive)}
<D>__{not really.}
<C>__{laroche}
<D>__{well, y'know it's not really about collecting the thing, it's about }
<C>__{orlean}
<D>__{the sundial isn't working.}
<A>__{laroche looks down at it.}
<C>__{laroche}
<D>__{it is so working.}
<A>__{orlean stares at the twig in the ground. she looks at laroche. laroche smiles sheepishly at orlean. rage and panic sweep across her face, her fists clench into balls. her eyes become wild, some dark fantasy plays out in her brain. laroche seems unaware.}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{the thing about computers. the thing i like is that i'm immersed in it but it's not a living thing that's going to leave or die or something. i prefer having the minimum number of living things to worry about in my life.}
<A>__{orlean's anger softens. she looks sadly at laroche.}
<C>__{orlean}
<D>__{so, john...}
<C>__{laroche}
<D>__{okay, fuck the sundial. we'll just go straight and eventually we'll get there.}
<A>__{they rise.}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{what i mean is we'll get somewhere. out of here. i mean, logically, we have to get out as long as we walk straight.}
<A>__{laroche points them in a direction and they walk.}
