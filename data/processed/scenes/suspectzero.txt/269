<L>__{50 yards out now. maybe close enough to hear o'ryan's voice...}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<P>__{(rambling, unraveling)}
<D>__{you don't understand. those fucking faces}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{on that map. they call to me. i see their eyes in the dark they're staring at me: "how did you let this happen to me?" but that's the thing about them they're like pictures. they never blink. they just...stare, and always at me. that's my destiny, do you see? i didn't help them when they needed me and this is my penance. fine. i accept it. but i'm opting out now, ya get it? i can't stand this anymore! i wanna close my eyes for once and see something other than torture.}
<P>__{(mackelway's expressionless)}
<D>__{it's not a bad start, mack. we've made the world a little safer now. speck, fulcher, starkey, now zero. we've made justice. but i get some too. you have to end all this for me. that's why you're here. it's your destiny.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{stop telling me about my fucking destiny!}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{but i've seen it!}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{open your eyes, o'ryan! here i am, standing here. i'm not shooting you. doesn't that fucking tell you something? you're a guy with a skill. period. they taught you more than they should've. i'm sorry about that... but you're not god. you can't see everything.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{yes i can! and you can too! that's why i chose you!}
<C>__{fran }
<D>__{mack?}
<A>__{mackelway's not budging. o'ryan can see that.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<P>__{(re: tire iron)}
<D>__{fine. i will make it easy for you:}
<A>__{o'ryan picks up that tire iron. mackelway sees what's coming. o'ryan swings the tire iron as mackelway backs out of its range.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{put the fucking thing down, o'ryan.}
<A>__{o'ryan keeps pursuing. another swing. mackelway keeps backing up. the swing misses.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{look. it's perfect. won't even need a hearing this way. you apprehended the suspect in the commission of a murder. then he turned on you and you fired in self defense.}
<A>__{o'ryan isn't letting up. and mackelway can't quite fire.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{these things are bigger than you haven't you seen that yet? destiny. justice. mercy. they're vast. we're just puppets!}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{i'm not going to kill you!}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{you don't get to decide that!}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{yes i do!}
<A>__{o'ryan takes one more swing, as:}
<C>__{fran }
<D>__{freeze!!!}
<A>__{silence. mackelway turns. so does o'ryan. there's fran, emerging from the tall wheat, gun trained right on o'ryan. his shock is total.}
<C>__{fran }
<D>__{drop it.}
<A>__{o'ryan doesn't move at first. then, slowly, an ironic smile snakes its way across his lips.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<P>__{(at mackelway, surprised)}
<D>__{it's funny. i never saw anyone else out here. did you?}
<A>__{mackelway doesn't answer. he can't. o'ryan eyes him.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{do it, mack. please.}
<P>__{(mackelway's silent)}
<D>__{please. i'm begging you.}
<A>__{there it was: the very thing mackelway's been hearing all this time, the exact words. unsettling as hell. ...and we begin to intercut: images of this moment with images from those "visions" that have been hinting at this very wheatfield since page one...}
