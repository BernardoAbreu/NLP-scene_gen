<ACTION>__{Activity of cars and taxis arriving and discharging passengers with luggage, busy redcaps, etcetera. We FOCUS on a taxi pulling up and stopping, The driver hands out modest looking luggage, including a bunch of tennis rackets in cases to a redcap. CAMERA PANS DOWN as the passenger gets out of the taxi so that we see only his shoes and the lower part of his trousers. He is wearing dark colored brogues and a conservative suit apparently. The feet move toward, the entrance to the station and out of scene. Immediately a chauffeur-driven limousine drives up and an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out of this, and the passenger alighting from the back is seen to be wearing black and white sport shoes which, as before, are all we see of him. The sport shoes start off in the wake of the brogues.}

<DIAL>__{Oh, excuse Me!}
<ACTION>__{CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to SHOW two young men seated in two parlor car chairs. BRUN0 ANTHONY, the wearer of the sport shoes, is about twenty-five. He wears his expensive clothes with the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has always had the best. The wearer of the brogues is a fine looking but, at the moment, a somewhat troubled young man. This is GUY HAINES. He, too, is in his middle twenties and is well dressed because he can now afford to be. He nods politely, acknowledging Bruno's apology, then turns away with the gesture implying he wants privacy.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(smiling with sudden recognition)}
<DIAL>__{I beg your pardon, but aren't you Guy Haines.}

<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(snapping his finger)}
<DIAL>__{Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right off the court in South Orange last season. What a backhand! Made the semi-finals, didn't you?}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(with open admiration)}
<DIAL>__{I certainly admire people who do things.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(smiling and introducing himself)}
<DIAL>__{I'm Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy looks up. Bruno indicates his gold tie pin which bears his name in cut- out letters. Guy looks at it with the faintest expression of disdain. I suppose you think it's corny. But my mother gave it to me so of course I wear it to please her.}

<DIAL>__{How do you do.}

<DIAL>__{Thanks.}
<ACTION>__{Guy tries to read but is uneasily aware of Bruno's open appraisal.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It must be pretty exciting to be so important.}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(fidgeting slightly)}
<DIAL>__{A tennis player isn't so important.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{People who do things are important. I never seem to do anything.}

<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Cigarette?}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not now, thanks.          I don't smoke much.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I smoke too much.}
<ACTION>__{He fumbles for a match.          Guy brings out a lighter and hands it to Bruno.}

<DIAL>__{Anne Burton. Sometimes I turn the sport page and look at the society news. And the pictures. She's very beautiful, Senator Burton's daughter.}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're quite a reader, Mr. Anthony.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, I am. Ask me anything, from today's stock reports to Li'l Abner, and I got the answer.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Even news about people I don't know. Like who'd like to marry whom when his wife gets her divorce.}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(sharply)}
<DIAL>__{Perhaps you read too much.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(contritely)}
<DIAL>__{There I go again. Too friendly. I meet someone I' like and open my yap too wide. I'm sorry...}
<ACTION>__{At the appeal on Bruno's face, Guy slowly relents.}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's all right. Forget it.    I guess I'm pretty jumpy.}
<ACTION>__{Bruno smiles with and signals a waiter.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There's a new cure for that.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to waiter)}
<DIAL>__{Scotch and plain water. A pair. Double.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Guy with a chuckle)}
<DIAL>__{Only kind of doubles I play.}

<DIAL>__{When's the wedding?}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What?}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The wedding. You and Anne Burton.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a gesture of explanation)}
<DIAL>__{It was in the papers.}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It shouldn't have been. Unless they've legalized bigamy overnight.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I have a theory about that. I'd like to tell you about it some time. But right now I suppose divorce Is still the simplest operation.}
<ACTION>__{The waiter has brought the drinks. Bruno slips the lighter into hip pocket to free his hands for the bills which he gives to the waiter, waving away the change. He offers a glass to Guy. Guy takes it.}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(as if he needs it)}
<DIAL>__{I guess I will.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(happily)}
<DIAL>__{This is wonderful -- having your company all the way to New York.}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(forced to explain)}
<DIAL>__{As a matter of fact, I'm not going direct. I'm stopping off. At Metcalf.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Metcalf? What would anybody want to go there for?}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's my home town.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, I get it! A little talk with your wife to about the divorce! I suppose she was the girl next door. Held her hand in high school and before you knew it -- hooked!}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(proud of his perspicacity)}
<DIAL>__{Am I right?}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(laconically)}
<DIAL>__{Close enough.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(raises his glass)}
<DIAL>__{Well, here's luck, Guy. Drink up -- then we'll have some lunch sent to my compartment.}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks very much. But I think I'll go to the dining car.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(he hails a waiter}

<DIAL>__{Do you know if there are any vacant seats in the dining car now?}
<CHAR>__{WAITER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not for about twenty minutes I'm afraid, Sir.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pleased)}
<DIAL>__{See? You'll have to lunch with me.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(motions the waiter back)}
<DIAL>__{Say, waiter, bring me some lamb chops and French fries and chocolate ice cream, Compartment D, Car 121.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(turns to Guy)}
<DIAL>__{What'll you have, Guy?}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks just the same, but I really don't think --}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, go on and order.}
<ACTION>__{The waiter is hovering impatiently.   Guy gives in out of embarrassment.}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, I'll Just have a hamburger and a cup of coffee.}

<LOC>__{INT. BRUNO'S COMPARTMENT ON TRAIN (PROCESS)}
<ACTION>__{Bruno and Guy are finishing lunch. Bruno has been drinking and his eyes are bright and feverish. An almost empty liquor bottle is near a couple of detective novels covered with gaudily Illustrated dust jackets. Bruno has in unlighted cigarette in his mouth. Guy's lighter is on the table. Bruno snaps it a couple of times, as though fascinated, lights his cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure, I went to college. Three of them. Every time they kicked me out my father threw me back in.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(bitterly)}
<DIAL>__{He finally gave up. He thinks I'm awfully small fry, not worth the bait.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(wistfully)}
<DIAL>__{You my friend, Guy?}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure.   I'm your friend, Bruno.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a little woozy)}
<DIAL>__{No, you're not, nobody thinks I'm anything special. Only my mother.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(hitting the bottom}
<DIAL>__{of the bottle for}
<DIAL_PAR>__{the last drop)}
<DIAL>__{And I hate him. He thinks   I ought to catch the eight-five bus  every morning, punch a timeclock  and work my way up selling paint or  something. Him -- with all his money!}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(amused by Bruno)}
<DIAL>__{Well, what do you want to do?}

<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(leaning forward eagerly)}
<DIAL>__{I want to do everything. I got a theory you're supposed to do everything before you die. Have you ever driven a car, blindfolded, at a hundred and fifty miles an hour?}

<DIAL>__{Not lately.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(amused and curious)}
<DIAL>__{What are you trying prove?}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm not like you, Guy. You're lucky. You're smart. Marrying the boss's daughter is a nice short cut to a career, isn't it?}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(quickly)}
<DIAL>__{Marrying the senator's daughter has nothing to do with it. Can't a fellow look past a tennis not without being a goldbricker?}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Take it easy, boy. I'm your friend, remember? I'd do anything for you.}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{What'd you say her name was -- your wife's?}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Miriam.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's it. Miriam Joyce Haines. Played around a lot, I suppose?}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Let's not talk about it any more.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(almost hopefully)}
<DIAL>__{Maybe she'll make more trouble for you.}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't think so.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You mean you got enough on her to get your divorce no matter what?}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Let's change subject, Bruno, can't we?}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay, Guy. Want me to tell you one of my ideas for murdering my father?}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(indicating the detective novels)}
<DIAL>__{You've been reading too many of these.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(going right on)}
<DIAL>__{You want to hear about the busted light socket in the bathroom, or the carbon monoxide in the garage?}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No. I may be old fashioned, but I thought murder was against the law.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But not against the law of nature. My theory is that everybody is a potential murderer. Didn't you ever want to kill somebody? Say one of those useless fellows Miriam was running around with?}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You can't go around killing people just because you think they're useless.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, what's a life or two? Some people are bitter off dead, Guy. Take your -- wife and my father, for instance. It reminds me of a wonderful idea had once. I used to put myself to sleep at night -- figuring it out. Now, let's say you want to get rid of your wife.}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why?}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Let's say she refuses to give you a divorce --}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(raises a finger and stops Guy's protest)}
<DIAL>__{Let's say. You'd be afraid to kill her because you'd get caught. And what would trip you up? Motive. Now here's the plan...}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm afraid I haven't time to listen.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(ignoring the remark)}
<DIAL>__{It's so simple, too. A couple of fellows meet accidentally, like you and me. No connection between them at all. Never saw each other before. Each of them has somebody he'd like to get rid of, but he can't murder the person he wants to get rid of. He'll get caught. So they swap murders.}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Swap murders?}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Each fellow does the other fellow's murder. Then there is nothing to connect them. The one who had the motive isn't there. Each fellow murders a total stranger. Like you do my murder and I do yours.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(with relief)}
<DIAL>__{We're coming into my station.}
<CHAR>__{BRUNO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
