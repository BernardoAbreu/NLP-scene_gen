<L>__{exterior gallows day}
<A>__{throckmorton drops. his body flails. his neck breaks. a roar of bloodlust from the crowd. (renumbered see scene 51a)}
<L>__{interior private chapel night}
<A>__{bess is on her knees before the simple altar, her head bowed in prayer. raleigh enters through the rear doors. he stands in silence, watching her as she prays. he hears her sigh. he takes a step towards her. she hears, startled. turns and sees him.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{oh! it's you!}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean to disturb you.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{my prayer's done.}
<A>__{she rises to her feet.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{something has distressed you.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{and i thought i prayed in silence.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{so you did.}
<A>__{she turns away, unable to look him in the eyes.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{a man was hanged today. a papist. i knew him well. he was my cousin. he died because i gave information. i gave information to prove my loyalty. because i was afraid.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{that's necessity. that's the world we live in.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{he told me he wanted to change. become part of the new england. i was afraid that he was lying to me. but what if what if it was true?}
<A>__{he sees the horror in her eyes, at the thought that she has sent an innocent man to his death. tears rise to her eyes.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{what if i was his last hope? what if i was the one person he thought he could trust?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{if you knew him well, you will have sensed the truth.}
<C>__{bess}
<D>__{i thought so.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{he was hoping to use you. you did what you had to do.}
<A>__{she can no longer hold back the tears.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{there, now.}
<A>__{he wipes away a tear from her cheek. in desperate need of comfort, she throws herself into his arms. he holds her close as she sobs.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{we're all mortal, bess. we do what we can.}
<A>__{he strokes her cheek. she meets his eyes, filled with gratitude. she takes the hand that touches her face and moves it to her lips. she kisses it, still holding his eyes. he draws her back into his arms, and they kiss. suddenly they're kissing eagerly, greedily, their long pent up passion released at last.}
