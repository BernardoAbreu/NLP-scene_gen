<L>__{interior burger restaurant day}
<D>__{it is saturday morning and the place is full of families. christmas decorations are beginning to look ragged. anna and helen are sitting at a table, terrified but trying hard to stay calm. stepan arrives with a tray of coffees and a burger. he sits, and anna and helen glance uneasily at each other. stepan begins to eat noisily.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{how the hell can you eat?}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{i'm hungry. there is a tension that builds until nikolai's mercedes suddenly looms into view, filling the street window of the burger bar. nikolai gets out of his car, all shades and sharp suit.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that's their driver. stepan very deliberately slides his hand into his inside pocket.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(hissing)}
<D>__{tell me you haven't done anything ridiculous... stepan removes his hand, empty, his bravado crushed. nikolai enters the restaurant and spots anna. he comes and sits at the table beside stepan, opposite anna. it's a tight squeeze. anna and helen are stiff with terror. nikolai smiles.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{meet in a public place with lots of people around. very wise. he smiles at helen.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{and i see you brought along a body guard. also very wise. stepan is shaking with emotion and hisses something in russian.}
<C>__{stepan}
<P>__{(whispers, in russian)}
<D>__{when i was in the kgb, we knew how to deal with scum like you. nikolai smiles.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{when you were in what?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{shush, stepan. anna? nikolai is amused by the three of them. anna produces tatiana's diary and hands it to nikolai. nikolai studies it and nods. he gets to his feet...}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(shaking)}
<D>__{now you give me the address.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{what address?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{tatiana's family.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about. nikolai calmly heads for the door. stepan hisses.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{i told you! i knew they would do this.... anna gets to her feet.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{anna! no! come back here! anna races out of the restaurant in pursuit of nikolai.}
