<A>__{tight on miller's eyes as he wakes up. he doesn't know where he is. in horror, miller realizes he has been cocooned next to verheiden and connors. connors is dead, with his rib cage already bent outward. verheiden is barely alive with a face hugger attached to him. the tail is tightening around his throat. verheiden's cocooned body is right beside miller. protruding from verheiden's cocooned body is his shoulder holster that contains his pistol. pull back to reveal an egg cracking with a face hugger inside. miller has just a few seconds. miller reaches for verheiden's gun but he's virtually frozen in place, trapped in the cocoon. he struggles, fighting desperately to get to verheiden's gun. the face hugger is almost out. miller can't quite reach it. his only chance is just inches away from his fingertips.}

<A>__{miller sees that the face hugger is almost free. miller summons all his strength, fighting to get out. he grabs the gun just as the alien face hugger leaps for him. it's too late. miller is dead for sure. one second too late. but then somehow he gets a shot off at the last possible second that hits the alien face hugger squarely. the alien face hugger falls to the ground, still twitching. miller shoots it three more times killing it. our favorite nerd is a hero!}

<A>__{miller's adrenaline rush is assassinated by fear as we pull back to reveal: a field of alien eggs surrounding miller on all sides. and now he sees them. one by one the eggs begin to open. miller holds his gun in hand ready to fight, but his face shows the acceptance of impending death.}
