<C>__{judge frankel}
<D>__{ you're telling me that just because some brooklyn landlord tips you off that he's been paid in cash, you have the right to call in the cavalry ! hub, as far as i know, paying cash is not yet a crime in this country.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{you're not hearing me. this khalil was carrying cash for }

<C>__{hub}
<D>__{i know we'll turn up trace elements of semtex, chemicals... something.}
<C>__{judge frankel}
<D>__{and when you do, you'll get your warrant.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{what about as a feasibility study?}
<C>__{judge frankel}
<D>__{meaning?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{we enter first, take a look, then fill out the warrant.}
<C>__{judge frankel}
<D>__{tell me the difference between that and breaking and entering?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{we're the good guys.}
<C>__{judge frankel}
<D>__{not good enough.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{what is good enough, judge? another bus? a school, maybe. these things come in waves.}
<C>__{judge frankel}
<D>__{waves mean nothing to me; there's been a wave of violent crime committed by black people in this city for the past twenty years, but if you came to me with a plan to put all black people behind bars as a preventative measure i'd send you packing. there's a price to be paid for living in a free society }
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{ and not in cash i guarantee it.}
<A>__{hub catches elise's eye "we're out of here."}

<A>__{elise and hub climb seemingly endless flights of stairs.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{ not two judges from now, not two hours from now, not two minutes from now. these guys could split any second and you've lost your best shot at }
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{frank's working another warrant }
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{you don't understand, they're pros! from the age of twelve they've been dodging people like you, people better than you.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{you mean people like you?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{ no matter how sparkling your record is, no matter how terrified you are to fail }
<A>__{finally he stops, turns on her:}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{it's... against... the... law.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{ just because you went to night school, or filled out the back of a matchbook or whatever you did to get a law degree doesn't make you sir thomas more.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{just because you talk the talk doesn't make you an expert. and just because you read my file doesn't make you an expert on me.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{you're gonna lose them and they're gonna do another horrible }
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{ you think i want to lose them. where do you get off talking that shit.}
<P>__{(controls himself...)}
<D>__{if i don't take 'em down properly they'll be on the street two hours from now. i could find dynamite, semtex, plutonium and a book of matches in there and unless i've got the right warrant it's all inadmissible}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{they've also got a warrant. a warrant from god. they're ready to die! and your quaint laws don't mean shit to these people.}

<C>__{elise}
<D>__{oh, really...?}
<A>__{they reach the top of the stairs where frank is waiting. he dangles a piece of paper the warrant and grins. in the same squalid apartment building later hub looks through the surveillance equipment focused on an apartment across the street paper shades drawn. wearing a set of headphones, elise listens intently to the arabic conversation.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{they're discussing how hard it is to find a decent cup of coffee over here.}
<P>__{(hands headset to frank)}
<D>__{i make out three voices. what do you have on the infrared?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{three sounds right. if we had microwave we'd know for sure. the cia's got microwave, how come we don't have microwave.}
<A>__{hub, meanwhile is question a syrian landlord.}
<C>__{landlord}
<D>__{ three of them. all day long they watch tv. and eat pizza. nothing but pizza, pizza, pizza...}
