<L>__{interior heart of gold. bridge continuous}
<A>__{ford and arthur drag zaphod into the bridge. on the front screen, they can see the vogon ships flying away.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{we have to go! let's go!}
<C>__{zaphod}
<P>__{(still loopy)}
<D>__{right!}
<A>__{looking strangely happy, he slides the pink coordinate cube humma gave him into a slot on the console.}
<C>__{zaphod }
<D>__{computer! take us to magrathea!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what? no! follow those ships!}
<A>__{arthur lunges for a control. zaphod woozily tries to stop him. there's a struggle, then zaphod realizes...}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{hey my third arm. i had one, didn't i?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{we have to go after her!}
<A>__{the computer fires to life, bleeps and blips. only now it has an effete, effeminate, almost matriarchal voice.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{boys, please! not so rough. you're damaging my joystick.}
<A>__{they all look at the source of the voice, confused.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{who is that?}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{ghastly, isn't it? i was asked to change the personality type, this was the emergency back up.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{how, if you want me to take you somewhere, we're going to have to start using our magic words, "please" and "thank you."}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{can you change it back?}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{i can but i won't enjoy it.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i'm wait ing...}
<A>__{arthur sees the vogon ships getting away. desperate, he shoves_zaphod out of_the_driver's seat. zaphod hits the floor, considers protesting, lies down on the floor to sleep instead with a contented smile. arthur sits. he looks very out of place in a seat normally reserved for the likes of han solo. he scans the console. ford sits in the seat beside him.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{ford?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{marvin?}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{don't look at me. i'm too depressed.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(getting desperate)}
<D>__{computer?! isn't there some kind of manual override switch thing?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yeeessss...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{well where the hell is it?!}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{magic words?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{show me the override switch or i will reprogram you with a very large axe.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{i can see this relationship is something we're all going to have to work at.}
<A>__{ding. a chime sounds. a switch on the console illuminates. "manual override." arthur flips the switch. the cockpit is sealed in a glass ball and shoots upwards.}
