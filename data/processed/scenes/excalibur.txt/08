<L>__{exterior battlements, tintagel castle evening}
<A>__{the duke of cornwall watches a force of armored knights riding forth from uther's war camp, with banners flying. it passes beneath the castle and on toward a distant cliff.}
<C>__{duke of cornwall}
<P>__{(to a lieutenant)}
<D>__{it's uther and all his best knights. he leaves behind little more than fledglings to guard his camp.}
<A>__{his eyes are as cold and as pale as ice.}
<L>__{exterior cliff above the sea twilight}
<A>__{uther and his knights, and merlin on a mule, ride to the high promontory and dismount. here, overlooking the sea, is a circle of ancient stones, carved with strange runes and hieroglyphics, and as the wind moves through them it moans and sighs. the knights watch as merlin and uther, leading his horse, walk toward the stones. merlin strides into the circle, turning to look at uther, who hesitates.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{come.}
<A>__{uther starts to make the sign of the cross, but merlin halts him with a gesture. uther's hand drops, and he enters the circle with his horse. merlin and uther look out across the sea, to tintagel castle high upon the cliff. merlin solemnly raises his arms toward that distant castle, and chants in an ancient language, the sounds of which he marries to the roaring and whining of the wind. the wind becomes stronger, and merlin's incantations become more intense, and the wind in turn becomes wilder still. until merlin is charged with a fierce, nonhuman power, as the wind buffets his slight frame. and then, for all to understand:}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{i hold the balance of all things in my summoning. arise mists. come fog.}
