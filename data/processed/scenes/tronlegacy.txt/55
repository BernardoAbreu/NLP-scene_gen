<L>__{interior ancient computer system tunnel}
<A>__{stalking their prey: rush, krod, i beem and d rezz.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{we can't go any further.}
<A>__{ahead, vast old circuitry has been "eaten through" by dull throbbing greenish memory leakage. paths of unaffected material are narrow and maze like.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{don't ask, dude.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{it's a memory leak, once it starts, it infects everything. i beem touch it and you crash forever. we cannot risk it.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{i agree.}
<A>__{d rezz grunts.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{then it's settled.}
<A>__{krod turns to head home.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{stop. listen to me. you might not believe there's a world outside of this one, but let's just say a guy named sinclair is depending on me. if tron got through here, then i can too. who's with me?}
<A>__{d rezz steps forward, then i beem. shamed, krod joins them. finally, mega makes it unanimous.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{good. i beem, take d rezz, see what's up ahead. we'll guard this portal until you come back.}
<A>__{i beem and d rezz buddy up and depart on a recon mission. krod pulls off his disk, nervously practices boomerang throws.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{better show me how to use mine.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{no problem. it's all in the velocity vector ratio.}
<A>__{rush pulls the disk off his own back. he throws disk flies wild he runs to retrieve it. mega retreats to a side area, partially eroded by memory leakage. she finds the remnants of com circuitry and stares data beams into its transducer.}
