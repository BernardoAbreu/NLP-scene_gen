<L>__{interior interrogation room}
<A>__{lights come on again. white is dazed in a chair, a bright light in his face blinds him.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{i don't remember.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{oh, no?}
<A>__{white shakes his head slowly and looks at the floor. the light is angled away, pointed down towards a table. white can see now.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{a featureless room. stromboli stands over him, behind him is bumstead and two shadowy guards. bumstead picks up an envelope, removes a series of photos, hands these to stromboli.}
<C>__{stromboli}
<D>__{john...}
<A>__{he throws the first shot down on the table in front of white. a black and white police photo of a murder victim.}
<C>__{stromboli}
<D>__{...murderer.}
<A>__{another photo goes down. another victim. another and another. each more grisly than the last.}
<C>__{stromboli}
<D>__{you'll sign a confession?}
<A>__{white nods. he's looks utterly lost. bumstead steps across to a small speaker box on the wall near the only door, presses a button.}
<C>__{bumstead }
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{two guards immediately step through the door, grab white by his arms. they carry him off.}
