<L>__{interior kitchen, black cove farm. day}
<A>__{ada looks out at the winter garden. from that distance it really does look like her father out in the field, arms outstretched as if waiting for her to run to him. she finds it unbearable, her tears coming, runs out into the fields, attacks the scarecrow, pulling off the hat, the clothes...}
<L>__{exterior railroad track. morning}
<A>__{the sound of tiny bells. a misty drizzle. a goat snuffles around in the freshly turned dirt: a hand, pale and wet, protrudes from the thin layer of earth covering the bodies of the murdered chain gang. something shifts under the dirt, breaking the surface. inman wedged under three or four corpses their limbs and chains wrapped around him, has regained consciousness. he coughs, can't breathe properly, tries to work himself some air, spitting out dirt. he makes a noise to distract the goat, rattling the chains. inman rears up, the bodies slithering off him, but even then the animal only retreats a yard or two. veasey slides face up, a bullet in his forehead like a mystical third eye. inman feels a surprising loss and tenderness. he heaves again, groaning with the pain of new and old wounds.}
