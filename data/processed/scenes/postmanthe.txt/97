<A>__{abby trudges along heavily. she stumbles as the ice covering the stream breaks beneath her feet.}

<A>__{the postman hears her call.}
<L>__{exterior hunting shack day}
<A>__{the door opens and out steps the postman. in pain, he staggers around the back of the cabin in search of her.}
<L>__{exterior stream day}
<A>__{abby looks up, sees him coming. the postman collapses across from her. both prone, they're also nearly nose to nose.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i can't help you.}
<A>__{finally, he pulls himself to his knees. she does the same. they climb each other to a standing position. arm in arm, they start for the cabin.}
<L>__{interior hunting shack dusk}
<A>__{abby sits huddled in blankets. the fire is blazing. the postman steps over, sets the once again hot bowl of stew before her. she considers the food a moment.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i told you that's all there was.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{that's why you should have it.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i knew you could walk.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you're weird, you know that?}
