<D>__{no ramps, no running water, no doctors... from the article in the newspaper i assumed this was a rehabilitation center.}

<D>__{don't believe everything you read.}

<A>__{franklin lies across a makeshift examining table. helena's examination is in progress. she is completely absorbed all business pouring over his muscles inch by inch. she kneads, bends and stretches them with a laser like focus, finally picking up franklin's leg and rotating it out and around.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{push against my hand.}
<A>__{franklin, with difficulty, tries to do so.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{give me the good news first.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{your gluteus maximus is better than i hoped. it will serve you well.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{must be all that sitting.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i'm serious. your right leg has some movement along the thigh. that's good because we can use it to help extend your hip, flex your knee and rotate your tibia.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i'm supposed to walk on one side?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{the water may help build some strength i'm not able to see yet. but to do that you would need to swim in the water much of the day. not the limited hours you have now.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{why should this place cater to a few able bodied folk when it could be opened year round with polios?}
