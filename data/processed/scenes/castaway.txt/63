<L>__{exterior farm house later that day}
<A>__{the children burst out the door, shrieking, chased by jango.}
<L>__{interior farm house day}
<A>__{the grown ups are cleaning up after christmas dinner. the scene moves between the table, the kitchen counter, and the refrigerator. it's an old fashioned kitchen, simply furnished.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{how's kelly?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{thought you were going to bring her.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{so did i.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{it seemed like she had such a good time last time.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{it's nothing you did, mom, believe me.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{jennifer's still down at the post office. and she's still got that crush on you.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{and she's still got those }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{roger.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{you should have stuck around.}
<A>__{this is an old, sore subject.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{look, i help take care of the place. you got my check, didn't you mom?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{that new roof, that's your doing.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{you're just allergic to farming, that's what dad said. can't stand to be alone. can't stand to be in one place. can't stand the sight of...blood.}
<A>__{he drops the turkey giblets into the trash.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{roger's going to put chickens in here.}
<A>__{chuck can't believe this.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{come on roger, this is dad all over again. you already did beefalo, chinchillas, and what was that, ostrich? they chased mom around the yard, sprained her hip.}
<A>__{mom goes to the freezer and takes out some frozen strawberries.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{it wasn't that bad, dear.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you can't make a living out of this place. we tried.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{but chickens?}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960. going to pass beef. chicken's global. no religious taboos. you don't see your hindus and your muslims boycotting poultry.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{true enough. no sacred chickens nowhere, so far as i know.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{roger's working at tyson's now.}
<A>__{mom mashes the block of frozen strawberries with a fork to separate the strawberries from the ice.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{come on down to the plant. it's state of the art. we're doing for chickens what fedex did for the delivery business.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{just don't count 'em before they hatch.}
<A>__{roger grins at him. this is just how they are.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{i will try to remember that.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{dessert.}
<A>__{they all sit down. mom brings the slushy frozen strawberries to the table, squirts on some reddi whip. looks pointedly at chuck.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{speaking of hatching, i could sure use some more grandchildren.}
<A>__{not a timely topic with chuck.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{mom, this is a farm. we've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{oh no, the prodigal son's home. we bring out the store bought.}
<A>__{chuck takes a bite, winces a little as the cold strawberries hit his teeth.}
