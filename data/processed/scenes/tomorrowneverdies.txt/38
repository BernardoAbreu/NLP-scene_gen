<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior venice harbor the next day }
<A>__{under a beautiful blue sky, the gleaming white sea dolphin ii sits at dock, festooned with pennants and banners. there's a crowd onboard. at the same time, however, 500 feet away...}
<L>__{interior dockside cafe }
<A>__{bond meets with signore digiacomo, a middle aged italian intelligence official in shirtsleeves. two underlings hover in the background.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{you've confirmed all the legal details with m? digiacomo si. bueno. she's very... 'competent.' ...for a woman.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{let's go over this one more time. digiacomo you will investigate the boat. you'll signal us if you find the enriched uranium. and then }
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{pardon.}
<A>__{he looks at a woman who has appeared with a baby in her arms.}
<D>__{italian woman w baby don franco. i just want to say we're voting for you in the election. digiacomo}
<P>__{(teasing, re: the baby)}
<D>__{both of you? italian woman w baby}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{of course. digiacomo grazie, grazie. ciao.}
<A>__{she leaves. he turns back bond:}
<D>__{digiacomo so. you'll signal us if you find the uranium }
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{and you'll wait until after the press conference and everyone is gone before you board the boat and arrest him. digiacomo perfecto. then we turn him over to you, and the english government puts him on a military transport back to london.}
<A>__{bond nods, looks over at the sea dolphin ii.}
<D>__{digiacomo do not worry, my friend. i only want what is best. for both of us.}
<A>__{bond stands to leave. digiacomo smiles after 007 as if he's savoring some private secret. he snaps his fingers to an underling:}
<D>__{digiacomo rocco! un cappuccino!}
<A>__{the sea dolphin ii as bond makes his way up the gangplank elliot harmsway is holding a press conference near the bow, surround ed by dignitaries. he is a man with an evil euphoria showing off all the charm and charisma that's made him one of the world's most powerful media tycoons.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{...and so, it's somewhat fitting that we are here today... to christen this environmental research boat in venice 'venezia' the port where marco polo sailed forth to explore the world's great uncharted oceans...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that 2 3 of the earth's surface where the sharks are not working members of the press.}
<A>__{laughter. bond studies the man. harmsway continues, pointing to a large drill boring object, the size of a jet engine, attached to a long flexible hose tube.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{with our six custom designed sea bed coring drills, we will probe the long term effects of pollution; our sonars, radars, and research labs will study the wind, the water, and the sea life that so dearly feeds us.}
<A>__{bond moves through the crowd. he spots a bulkhead, with a door.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{and so, in the spirit of international cooperation thanking my good friend, valentin zukofsky the newly elected president of the ukraine for all his assistance }
<A>__{he motions to zukofsky, who nods to the audience...}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{i give this boat to mankind selflessly in pure charity asking nothing for myself... but the cable tv rights.}
<A>__{big laugh from the assemblage. harmsway turns to a beauty queen:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{miss venice? if you'll do the honors }
<A>__{smash! she cracks a champagne bottle on the tip of the bow. cheers!}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{now i will take some questions from the press even the few of you who aren't on my payroll.}
<A>__{laughter. harmsway points to a reporter:}
<D>__{reporter #1 mr. harmsway: why did you name this boat the sea dolphin ii?}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{actually, my first choice was 'no comment.' so if someone asked where i was, i could truthfully respond 'no comment.'}
<P>__{(laughter; he points)}
<D>__{over there. reporter #2 sir elliot: is it true you're in negotiations to move your offices from hong kong to kuala lumpur?}
<C>__{harmsway}
<P>__{(impishly)}
<D>__{no comment.}
<A>__{amidst more laughter, bond disappears into the bulkhead door.}
