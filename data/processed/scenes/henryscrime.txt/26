<A>__{max's face starts to shudder...his shoulders jerking back a little bit...}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{i get this twitch! and then i give him my answer: "i'm gonna break in your house, set your dog on fire, eat all your food, go on a naked rampage through your garden, dance in the streets of your l'il hometown like a crazed harpee, hurl myself headlong flaming through the ethereal sky like god's blackest angel and explode like a goddamn heavenly fireball!}

<C>__{max }
<D>__{oh, yeah. you don't want me. you don't want this. not out there.}
