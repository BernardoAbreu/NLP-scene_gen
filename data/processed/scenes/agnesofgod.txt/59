<A>__{agnes, did you love your mother?}

<C>__{martha}
<A>__{why not?}
<C>__{agnes}
<A>__{because i don't want one.}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{if you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?}
<C>__{agnes}
<A>__{from someone who didn't want to have a baby.}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{like you?}
<C>__{agnes}
<P>__{(suddenly frustrated)}

<C>__{martha}
<A>__{how would that person get one if they didn't want one?}
<C>__{agnes}
<P>__{(jumping to her feet)}
<A>__{a mistake...}
<C>__{martha}
<A>__{agnes, how did your mother get you?}
<C>__{agnes}
<A>__{a mistake... it was a mistake...}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{is that what she said?}
<C>__{agnes}
<P>__{(very upset)}
<D>__{if you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a sainterior..}

<C>__{martha}
<D>__{agnes, i don't believe you know nothing about sex...}

<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{everything... i don't have children.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{agnes... martha puts her arm out to agnes who slaps it away.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{don't touch me like that! you don't touch me like that, i know what you want from me, you want to take god away. you should be ashamed, they should lock you up people like you. agnes disappears down through the trapdoor. martha throws her}
