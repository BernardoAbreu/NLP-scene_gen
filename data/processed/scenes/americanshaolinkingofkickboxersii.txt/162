<A>__{drew pauses for a moment, examining the room. it is filled with wooden statues of monks, all in different fighting positions. the carvings are precise and incredibly beautiful. their arms, open hands, fists and legs are fashioned out of hard wood, and they look very dangerous indeed. drew gathers himself for a moment, then starts into the chamber. angle on drew's foot as it presses down on one of the stones of the floor. the attacks start from all sides, as the wooden statues come to life, spinning, lunging and striking. drew is caught off guard, and is hit several times, driven back to the door of the chamber. the statues stop moving. drew, a little scared, tries to remember the sequence of the statues, letting his arms practice for the attacks. there is fear in his eyes. he starts in again, and the attacks come again, but they are different this time. drew is clobbered. driven back to the door, drew slumps against the wall. his face is already bruised and bleeding.}

<A>__{he enters the chamber again, and the attacks start again. drew, however, is prepared (both mentally and physically). he blocks, avoids, rolls, jumps and redirects the attacks on him, making his way across. he is about halfway across when an especially fierce and large statue comes crashing towards him. drew, caught a little off guard, quickly adjusts and manages to jump and spin out of the way. suddenly, as he turns and tries to get his breath, two huge, deadly spears are streaking towards him. drew blocks the spears with his arms, misdirecting them into the wall behind him. they thwock into the wall, sticking there. as he rounds a particularly difficult series of statues, a volley of arrows comes hurtling towards him. drew blocks some, avoids others, and catches one in each hand. he throws them down and continues on. he goes past the few remaining statues, and is out of the wooden man chamber. all that is left is to walk down a little hallway and out the door. drew looks behind him, then starts to walk. he goes cautiously, expecting a trap or a trick. nothing happens. he gets to the door and looks for a handle on the door. he spots a handhold near the top of the door, and pulls it with his hand. immediately, his hands is locked in and a panel in the ceiling drops right onto his arm, forcing it down. drew fights back with his muscles, the veins popping out in his arms and neck. behind him, a statue has started coming towards him, spinning like a dervish. its fists and legs are extended, and they are deadly. the panel drops lower and lower.}

<B>__{angle on panel}
<A>__{as it slows with a grinding noise, then stops.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{holding up the heavy stone panel with his arm, his face and body completely relaxed. the panel goes back up into the ceiling, and the door opens. the whirling statue slows, and then stops altogether. drew reaches up with a hook kick and taps it in the face.}
