<L>__{interior palace throne room day}
<A>__{emperor commodus is standing before a group of male children and their tutors in his throne room. the throne room is still very much the province of his father. manuscripts and astronomical charts and papyrus scrolls and wax tablets litter the heavy desk. a large bust of marcus aurelius is in one corner. lucilla and senator falco are present. so too senators gracchus and gaius and captain marcellus. a well rehearsed child presents commodus with a laurel wreath.}
<C>__{child}
<D>__{we honor caesar with the laurel to show our love and appreciation for his benevolence.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{caesar is honored to accept your tribute, citizen scholar.}
<A>__{the child smiles and moves back to his fellows.}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(to all)}
<D>__{it is the most sacred duty of the emperor to oversee the education of the young. if i could leave no other legacy than the scholarship of all children my life would be blessed. tutors, you hold the future of rome in your hands. teach them well so that they will bring honor to the empire. i salute you.}
<A>__{commodus actually bows before them, an unimaginable honor. the tutors bow in response and herd the children out.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{look at them, senators... my truest gift to rome.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{darling children, to be sure, now if i may proceed?}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{very well...}
<A>__{commodus moves to the desk, standing over it and gazing at marcus' scrolls as:}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{caesar, your presence in rome is an invaluable opportunity to begin correcting some of the ills that have beset the city since your father went to the wars. we would like to }
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{peace, good gracchus, peace...}
<A>__{commodus slowly begins pushing marcus' papyrus scrolls off the desk to the floor, one by one, as:}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{my beloved father was a careless shepherd to his flock. i shall be a good father to my children. i shall remain in rome and show them how they are loved.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{with respect, sire, the people don't need love they need law. the senate has prepared a series of protocols to begin addressing the corruption in the city }
<P>__{(gaius hands him a scroll)}
<D>__{ starting with basic sanitation in the hebrew quarter. if caesar could study this and }
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{you see that's the very problem, isn't it, my old, old friend? my father spent all his time at study. at books and learning and philosophy...}
<A>__{as commodus speaks he moves to the chair behind the desk, tries it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave. the chair is whisked away.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{he spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the senate. all the while, the people were forgotten.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{the senate is the people.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{i doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, senator gracchus...}
<A>__{as commodus speaks he moves to the bust of marcus, studies it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave and the bust is whisked away. lucilla watches this closely.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{i doubt many of the people have such splendid armor, captain marcellus. or such fine mistresses, senator gaius. no... only their true father knows what the people need. i shall show them they are loved. i shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly }
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?}
<A>__{commodus stops. looks at him. a lethal moment.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{no. but if you interrupt me one more time i assure you that you shall. i will emulate the immortal caesars of the past. i will give the people what they truly want. starting this day i will draw all of rome to the colosseum. i will give them bread. and they will want nothing more.}
<A>__{startled looks between gracchus, gaius and marcellus.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{you want to hold games?}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{not just any games, senator! a series of games that will make the gods envious and leave my children happy! i will subsidize the arena from this day forth and i will culminate this celebration in a great spectacle the likes of which the world has never seen! a great spectacle to honor my father! magnificent, unending weeks of festivity all in the name of marcus aurelius!}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{if i may, caesar... how are you going to pay for this?}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{that is not your concern.}
<A>__{gracchus ignores a warning look from gaius.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{respectfully, sire, taxation and import duties are the exclusive province of the senate }
<A>__{commodus spins on him so quickly and with such feral violence that everyone is shocked }
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{my father deserves to be honored and i will honor him! and the people will love me! and the senate will obey me or every one of you will burn! burn! burn! i will have order!}
<A>__{he snarls like a great jungle cat and he stalks away. senator falco quickly follows. a dreadful silence. then:}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{gentlemen, in the future do not concern my brother with these matters. come to me.}
<A>__{she sweeps out. a beat.}
<C>__{marcellus}
<D>__{games? he wants to hold games?}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{it's madness.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{no... it's not...}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{he knows who rome is. rome is the mob. he will conjure magic for them and they will be distracted. and he will takes their lives. and he will take their freedom. and still they will roar. the beating heart of rome isn't the marble of the senate. it's the sand of the colosseum. he will give them death. and they will love him for it.}
