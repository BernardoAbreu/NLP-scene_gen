<L>__{exterior wood, lakeside day}
<A>__{rode and steve walking. rode suddenly turns to him:}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{i've remembered something else...}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{furtwangler sent hitler a telegram for his birthday.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{he did?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{one of your people told me.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{one of my people?}
<A>__{they start to walk away from the water.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{yes. a corporal. us army. a jew. he said he'd seen the telegram in the chancellery.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{son of a gun. we'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.}
<A>__{he stops, takes out a cigarette, offers one to rode, lights them both, gives rode the packet. they smoke for a moment.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{but i need documentary proof. you know of anything like that?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{no. but that's why we hated him. we admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the party and yet he had a better life than any of us. he didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. he got everything from them, everything. he was filthier than any of us party members.}
<A>__{the sun is setting. rode stops suddenly.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{there's a rumour... i don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der null.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{never heard of him, who is he?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{edwin von der null. music critic. he gave furtwangler terrible reviews while he raved about herbert von karajan.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{who's he?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{also a conductor. very brilliant. young. von der null called him 'the miracle von karajan'. furtwangler was outraged and they say he had von der null conscripted into the army. the same thing happened to another critic. true or not, it's not such a bad idea. critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the russian front.}
<P>__{(chuckks.)}
<D>__{but if you really want to get furtwangler, ask him about herbert von karajan.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{the miracle kid.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as k.}
<A>__{rode tries to make up his mind about something, then decides. he reaches into an inside pocket and takes out a small black notebook.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{and ask him about his private life.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{his private life?}
<A>__{rode hesitates, then he hands steve the black book.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{yes, it's all in here. his women.}
