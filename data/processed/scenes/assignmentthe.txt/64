<A>__{jack pushes through the plastic shroud into a command center like room. he and ramirez enter. this place is high tech, computers and neon lighting.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{carlos has two main safe houses. one in libya, one in east germany. we have satellites that pass over each one three times a day. unfortunately, the russians know exactly when our satellites are in position so we have to assume that carlos knows as well.}
<A>__{they cross over to the satellite tracking monitors which display both the libyan and east german safe houses. sitting in front of one of the monitors is amos, typing controls into the satellite tracking system.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there's one person i want you to meet, though i think the two of you have already been introduced.}
<A>__{amos now turns and comes around to ramirez.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{hello miguel... my name is amos.}
<A>__{ramirez stares at him.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{oh yeah... i didn't recognize you without my foot chained to the floor.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{i hope there are no hard feelings.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{there are a lot of hard feelings. and i'm still gonna sue you when this is over.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{miguel, this is a combined israeli american operation. amos here knows carlos better than anyone in the free world. he was the one who took that picture of carlos in libya.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{if you could get a picture of him why didn't you just kill him?}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{don't let all this equipment fool you. carlos still has the home court advantage. he has the best protection in the world... three layers at least at all times. next and maybe most important... carlos himself. the french dst came to arrest him once. he was at his apartment, drunk, playing his guitar. he actually had them convinced it was all a mistake. then he went into his bathroom, took a shave mind you so he would look his best for the interrogation and when he came out managed to shoot each of them through the forehead. then he got the informer who had betrayed him, put him down on his knees and killed him... think of it. he took a shave and didn't even nick himself once.}
<A>__{amos is quiet, lets that sink in.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{finally, there are political realities. whoever hits carlos has to realize that he'll unleash against himself a fanatical wave of terrorist activity in retribution.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that by the way, is the last question you're going to ask. from now on you'll get information when and how we want you to get it. not before. you don't ask questions, you just do what you're told.}
