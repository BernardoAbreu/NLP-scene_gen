<C>__{dan }
<D>__{we can't just sit up here until next weekend. we'll die.}
<A>__{no one acknowledges him. he sighs and closes his eyes. parker starts to cry. neither of the guys even try to console her. finally, dan puts an arm around her.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{shhh. it's ok.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{somebody help us!!}
<A>__{his voice is getting hoarse.}

<P>__{(aside to parker)}
<D>__{it's alright. it's alright.}
<A>__{snow starts to lightly fall around them.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{hey. it's snowing.}
<A>__{they shiver together.}

<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{great.}

<D>__{disneyworld in 8th grade.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{hmm...guess that leaves me. i'm gonna go with...oh yeah...these skis! get it? my skis. how ironic, huh?}
<A>__{silence. parker takes off her glove to light a cigarette. as she struggles with the lighter, the glove falls out of her lap and lands on the ground below them.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{shit!}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{see? that's where smoking gets you.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{she keeps struggling with the lighter but eventually gives up. she throws the cigarette away and puts her exposed hand back in her pocket. the snow falls around them. dan pushes the safety bar up.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{ what, what are you doing?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i'm jumping. i'm gonna get help.}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{dan...woah. let's talk about this.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{no. no, don't leave me up here.}
<A>__{dan takes her face in his hands. tenderly. and probably for the first time...correctly.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{parker, i can do this. even if i get hurt, as long as i can get to the bottom i....your skin is so red. you're getting frost bite.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{you can't get frost bite that fast. it's only been what, like...how long has it been? a few hours, tops?}
<A>__{dan inspects parker's face. it's tough to see in the dark, but the tip of her nose and her right cheek (the side facing into the wind) is discoloring.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{don't leave me.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i will get help. lynch is here. he'll be with you.}
<A>__{lynch is looking down below them. it's far.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{dan, it's a far drop. i don't know.}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(heated)}
<D>__{do you have a better idea? i'm telling you, i've totally jumped off of a lift before.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{if we can wait `til morning i bet someone will come up here. like a snow groomer or some shit.}
<C>__{dan}
<B>__{e}
<D>__{really? and why would they come groom the snow on a day when they aren't open, joe? a day when they still have a full work week before they open again?}
<A>__{lynch says nothing.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{i can do this.}
<A>__{he positions himself to try and jump off. parker grabs his arm.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{no, no, no. please don't jump down there, dan. you'll get hurt.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{how are you going to find your way in the dark?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i will stick to the trail. i will ride to the bottom.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{you don't get a fresher run than this, right?}
<A>__{dan drops his snowboard down. it lands sticking up straight in the snow.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{parker and lynch look back at him. they don't know what to say. lynch tries to grab on to dan's arm.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{walker, no.}
<A>__{dan shrugs free. he is determined. concentrating.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{one.}
<A>__{parker's tears are freezing on her cheeks as the seconds tick by.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{...two.}
<B>__{e}
<A>__{lynch takes a deep breath. when enough time has elapsed to think dan's gonna jump, he suddenly looks up at lynch instead of jumping.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{remember when i was saying how i jumped off one of these things before?}
<A>__{lynch stares back at him.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{i totally lied. i'm scared shitless right now.}
<A>__{lynch musters a laugh. it's forced, but it's a laugh. dan laughs back at him. he turns to face parker. she tries to smile but is frozen with fear. dan whispers to her...}
<C>__{dan }
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{you're gonna be ok, baby.}
<A>__{...and he is gone. from his point of view (the camera pointed down at his feet) we drop (without cutting) from the chair all the way to the frozen ground below.}
