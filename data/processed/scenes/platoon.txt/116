<L>__{exterior jungle rhah and chris' position day}
<A>__{next to the church deployed in the jungle, rhah looks on, silent. chris in his position, waits. it is so silent in comparison to the racket from the battle across the forest. the mist clings to the trees, moist and lovely. then, a flicker of movement, sound. chris hears it, tightens. his pov at fifty yards. an evanescence of beige and green uniforms moving towards him very fast, scurrying. they look like headless ghosts. chris opens fire.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{get em!!!!!}
<A>__{rhah and crawford open up. a rachet of sound, one of the fiures seems to go down, then another but at this distance through jungle it is difficult to say. the firing just as suddenly breaks off and the silence returns.}

<P>__{(sees him, stunned)}
<A>__{crawford, the blond locked california beach boy, lies on the earth, hit in a lung, having difficulty breathing, moaning in a soft undercurrent. chris runs up on him.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{oh man! ... man!}
<A>__{attending him. rhah runs up.}
<C>__{rhah}
<D>__{looks like a lung babe. but you're gonna be all right, you only need one of them fuckers.}

<D>__{now. or i will article 15 both your asses. move!}
<A>__{chris and rhah look at barnes sullenly, then reluctantly start moving crawford onto a poncho liner they use as a litter.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{move it, move it!}
<A>__{he's in his blackest rage, the force of his words almost physically pushing the men to move out with crawford. barnes turns now to deal with elias.}
