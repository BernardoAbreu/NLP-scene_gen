<A>__{john drops an armload of books into a library cart, each having something to do with prison or prison life. he sits at a table at the back, flipping through them one at a time and discards each in turn. as the shadows grow longer we find him staring at the computer screen linked to the school system. on the screen: a book summary disappears, to be replaced by the school search engine many of the items have already been inspected. john finds one that reads "over the walls." he clicks on the link and the title page appears. the author is damon pennington. there's a photo of him. the caption reads that he lives in brooklyn, ny.}
