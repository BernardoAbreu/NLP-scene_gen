<A>__{a shuriken blade grinds against a whetstone as raizo sharpens the weapon with practiced grace...despite being blindfolded. sunlight is held back by vertical blinds. when he finishes, he stands, a rodin sculpted out of midnight. we realize there are wooden blocks placed around the room. in his palm, a single shuriken abruptly fans into many like a deck of cards. suddenly his arm whips around as the shurikens crack and split the thick wooden targets. he stands alone, still blindfolded.}

<A>__{raizo gets up, slowly releasing the tension in his jaw. he takes his position again, and this time the stance is easy, his expression softer. this time, as takeshi comes at him, everything becomes clear. the whistle of the blade. the zip of the leg sweep against the tatami mat. the sound of his robe. combined with takeshi's unmistakable body odor raizo has everything he needs to dodge, slip and counter. his chain strikes, wrapping an ankle, throwing a stunned takeshi to the wall. kiriko tries to hide her smile. ozunu nods in appreciation. raizo nods back, as if he can see without eyes. flashback interior orphanage dormitory night young raizo, still blindfolded is in bed. trying to sleep, but it's impossible. takeshi's snoring doesn't help. he turns slightly towards kiriko, as her chest rises and falls, her breath as rhythmic as and gentle as the lap of sea water in a tidal pool. he begins to breathe in sync with her, perhaps in hopes it will relax him. slowly, all the other sounds in the room go away, until only her breathing, and his, remains. there is the slight murmur of their hearts. then she opens her eyes...and smiles at him because he cannot see her. but he hears her heart begin to beat faster and that brings a faint smile to his lips. they listen to each other's breathing growing heavier, the sound of their hearts beating faster and faster. her lips part as she makes the tiniest movement...tilting her pelvis up, rubbing her hips ever so slightly against the blanket it's like tectonic plates shifting for raizo. bump thump, bump thump, bump thump their hearts growing louder and louder as they become }
