<L>__{interior bunny's room day}
<A>__{bunny sits on the floor in dim light, wearing an enormous blue sweatshirt. obviously dad's. her naked barbies sit in a semi circle watching her braid a meticulous loop out of the paper and foil from chewing gum wrappers. quoyle enters, and sits close beside her. watches in silence, as she works.}
<C>__{bunny }
<D>__{warren died today. she's not coming back.}
<A>__{no tears. just a hollow sound in her voice.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{that's the difference.}
<A>__{he knows what she means. strokes her hair.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{another necklace, huh? can i help?}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{you can watch.}
<A>__{okay. he looks at the barbies.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{do i have to take my clothes off?}
<A>__{she looks up at him. straight to his eyes.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{you look better with 'em on.}
<A>__{goes back to work. he watches her.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you know. you do look good in blue.}
