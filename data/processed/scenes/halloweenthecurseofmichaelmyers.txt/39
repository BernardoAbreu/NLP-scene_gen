<A>__{water runs into a grimy basin. unable to contain her tears, she washes the newborn. takes a roll of paper towels and tries to rub the triangular blood mark off his chest. suddenly the lights go out. jamie gasps. clutching her baby, she turns off the faucet and melts into the darkness. the door creaks open. footsteps echo inside.}
<B>__{jamie}
<A>__{has locked herself inside one of the stalls. heart pounding. the footsteps grow louder. jamie's eyes dart frantically.}
<B>__{stalking p.o.v.}
<A>__{moving methodically past the row of stalls, pushing open each door, revealing that they are all empty. a crash from the last stall. p.o.v. moves toward it. rustling and movement inside. a hand pushes on the door. an open window above the toilet. jamie is gone!}
