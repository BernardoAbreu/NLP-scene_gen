<A>__{a cctv centre over the casino. jack crosses the room, looking down through a glass floor at the empty casino below. reynolds walks over to a series of twenty or more banked tv monitors with many video 8 tape decks.}

<D>__{this is our crow's nest. i'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{very impressive.}
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{we have tapes in here that go back six months. let me show you something.}
<A>__{reynolds presses a button. together they look at a tv monitor which shows an overlook of a roulette table where a woman is cheating. reynolds freezes the frame.}
<C>__{reynolds}
<D>__{see that? that was six weeks ago. the dealer missed it. the guy up here missed it, but i watch these tapes after hours. nothing gets by me. now the lady's in jail. it's easier to take ten million pounds from a bank than take one penny from this casino.}
