<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{she is lying in bed. the bedside lamp is on. we hear the radio coming from the living room: a program about the fauna and flora of the south seas, or something similar.}
<L>__{interior hallway living room day}
<A>__{georges comes out of the kitchen and opens the front door. on the doorstep stands the soloist (male or female) from scenes}
<L>__{3 and 4.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(somewhat perplexed, but pleased)}
<D>__{oh hello! nice to see you.}
<C>__{soloist}
<D>__{forgive me for dropping in on you like this, professor. i tried to reach you by phone a couple of times, but no luck.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i only pick up the phone when i've stored the caller's number and i can see who's calling. why didn't you leave a message? anyway, do come in...}
<A>__{he closes the door behind his guest.}
<C>__{soloist}
<D>__{i just couldn't manage to come by after the concert. i was so sorry, because i was so pleased you came along.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{come with me.}
<A>__{while they pass into the living room, they continue to speak:}
<C>__{soloist}
<D>__{... and now, an unexpected opportunity has arisen because francois mitry called me you know him, he's my agent to say he'd arranged for me to meet the boss of the theatre des champs elysees tonight to talk about their new concert series.}
<C>__{soloist }
<D>__{so i flew to paris this morning, and while i was in my hotel, i thought, i will just give it a try and drop in. after all, it's virtually just around the corner.}
<A>__{sorry, these are for your wife. he takes the bouquet of flowers from its wrapping paper and hands it to georges.}
<C>__{soloist }
<D>__{isn't she at home?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{yes, she is. i will go and get her in a minute. have a seat.}
<C>__{soloist}
<D>__{i hope i'm not disturbing you too much.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{no, not at all. i'm happy that you came. we were so thrilled by your concert. we hoped we'd see you again soon. please do have a seat. can i can get you something? a cup of tea?}
<C>__{soloist}
<D>__{no, no, thank you very much.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{hold on, i will just freshen up the flowers; in this heat they wilt so fast...}
<C>__{soloist}
<D>__{i've only just bought them. they should keep quite...}
<A>__{but georges has already left the room with the bouquet and closed the door behind him. the soloist looks around him. after a few moments we hear the voices of anne and georges in the distance, without understanding what they're saying. it lasts a while. finally georges opens the door and pushes anne, in her wheelchair, into the living room.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{martin! what a delight. how lovely to see you!}
<A>__{the (male or female) soloist has got up and doesn't quite know how to handle the situation.}
<C>__{soloist}
<D>__{mrs. laurent! lovely to see you too.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{don't get up. come on, sit yourself down and don't look so shocked.}
<A>__{the soloist sits down hesitantly, georges pushes the wheelchair between the two armchairs and also sits down. brief embarrassed pause.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{i'm so proud of you. we were both in raptures after your concert. georges wanted to buy your new cd the very next morning.}
<C>__{soloist}
<D>__{oh god! i wanted to bring you the cd, but i left in such a hurry that i forgot it. i'm so sorry. i will get one today and drop it by.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{no, no, don't worry. we want to make a contribution to your success. even if it's only twenty euros.}
<C>__{soloist}
<D>__{you've already contributed so much. i owe you so much, madame.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you owe it to your hard work and your talent.}
<C>__{soloist}
<P>__{(shaking his head a little)}
<D>__{do you remember, when you first gave me the bagatelles to play? i was twelve at the time, and in my youthful arrogance i said: "but why the bagatelles?" and you really gave me a piece of your mind.}
<A>__{they both smile. pause. then he goes on:}
<C>__{soloist }
<D>__{so what happened?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{my right side is paralyzed, that's all. it can happen when you get older.}
<C>__{soloist}
<D>__{and how...?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{let's talk about something else, shall we?}
<C>__{soloist}
<P>__{(disconcerted)}
<D>__{sure ...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{don't be offended. but i want to enjoy the lovely interlude you've given us with your visit.}
<C>__{soloist}
<P>__{(disarmed)}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{brief pause.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{you haven't told us yet what's been going on since the paris concert.}
<A>__{the soloist is a bit thrown by the couple's behavior.}
<C>__{soloist}
<D>__{well, actually i've spent most of the time in london studying. then i went to copenhagen for two performances, that was schubert too. my whole life revolves around schubert at the moment. the concerts with the impromptus and the moments musicaux, and for my bread and butter work i'm developing the sonatas. not the late ones, i think i still need a couple more years for those.}
<A>__{(the dialogue concerning music will be modified according to the performer chosen.)}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{could you do me a favor?}
<C>__{soloist}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{would you play fur elise?}
<C>__{soloist}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{um, i don't know if i remember it very well. beethoven, it's been a long time since i've... but if you want...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{give it a try.}
<C>__{soloist}
<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{he looks at georges, then at anne again, gets up, goes to the grand piano and plays.}
