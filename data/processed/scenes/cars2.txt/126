<A>__{then she looks over, catches a glimpse of grem and acer, bearing down on them from a side street. they're going to broadside mater and mcqueen.}

<D>__{oh no.}
<A>__{on mater and mcqueen they're not aware of the impending impact. holley drops from the sky, hits the pavement, skids into the path of the amcs and deflects them. they flip over holley, finn and mcqueen and sail into a pub where they skid across the room and slam into the bar, knocking a row of beer mugs to the ground. in the pub moments later grem and acer are pulverized by the bar patrons.}
