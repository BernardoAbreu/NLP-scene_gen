<C>__{mrs. bretsaws}
<D>__{... and as for screwing, i have all i need at home, thank you very much. with a few days off every month, i'm sure i will be fine. the only thing i'm interested in is the care of the child and i can tell she needs some.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh, yeah? how do you figure that?}
<C>__{mrs. bretsaws}
<D>__{shouldn't i be discussing all this with the father?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, listen, mrs. fretsaw, umm... brainsore...}
<C>__{mrs. bretsaws}
<D>__{bretsaws, mrs. bretsaws.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{right... bratsnot, lemme tell you something. with a child you always know who the mother is, but the father that's another kettle of fish. so don't give me that bullshit, okay?}
<C>__{mrs. bretsaws}
<D>__{very well. i won't discuss it any further with you. will you please show me where the kitchen and the bathroom are?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{mrs. bretsaws}
<D>__{so i can make you a list of the things we need.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what do you mean, make you a list? don't you do the shopping yourself?}
<C>__{mrs. bretsaws}
<D>__{no shopping or laundry or housekeeping. i am a professional nanny.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we have plenty of everything.}
<C>__{mrs. bretsaws}
<D>__{do you have a sufficient amount of fruit and vegetables for the child?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{she only eats milk and cereal.}
<C>__{mrs. bretsaws}
<D>__{that's not enough, sir. from the age of three months children should be started on a normal, varied diet.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh that's bullshit. you don't feed a baby like an adult.}
<C>__{mrs. bretsaws}
<P>__{(mockingly)}
<D>__{oh, really? and how would you know?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i've read plenty of books. the diet recommended by those quack pediatricians today is way too rich. i'm in favor of natural methods, mrs. breathminterior}
<C>__{mrs. bretsaws}
<D>__{bretsaws, mrs. bretsaws.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{for instance, if a child is having trouble getting to sleep, what would you do?}
<C>__{mrs. bretsaws}
<D>__{depends, if it was a continuing problem, i might recommend a mild sedative...}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(exploding, triumphantly)}
<D>__{i knew you'd say something like that, you jerk!}
<C>__{mrs. bretsaws}
<D>__{fine. anything you say, sir. let me just remind you that i have my diploma and that medicine is a serious matter.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{do you know the song that goes 'medicine's a whore and the pharmacist is her pimp'?}
<C>__{mrs. bretsaws}
<D>__{no, i don't. we must listen to different music. personally i'm very fond of opera.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{mrs. breakballs, if you don't get out of here right this minute i'm gonna punch you in the nose! this is my home, now get out!}
<C>__{mrs. bretsaws}
<D>__{the name's bretsaws. i am blessed with infinite patience when it comes to children, sir, but i'm not qualified to deal with lunatics. goodbye and good luck!}
<A>__{mrs. bretsaws grabs her suitcase and exits, dignified and stiff as a broom, slamming the door behind her.}
