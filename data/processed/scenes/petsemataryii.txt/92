<L>__{interior amanda and gus' bedroom night}
<A>__{gus enters from the steamy bathroom. the shower is still running. amanda stirs, sleepy eyes focusing on him.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{gus, hon. i'm sorry about tonight. you coming to bed?}
<A>__{gus lifts the covers and climbs in. with him comes the chill of death. gus presses up behind her. his hand moves beneath the sheets, finding its way over the curve of her waist, caressing. amanda shivers.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{god, you're ice cold...}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{...and you smell! lord, what did you get yourself into?}
<A>__{it's then that amanda sees the bandage around gus' neck. blood is seeping through the gauze.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{my god, gus, what happened?}
<A>__{amanda reaches out to touch him, but gus stops her hand short of the bandage. instead, he leans forward and clutches one of her breasts. amanda tries to twist away.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{gus... stop it! what's wrong with you?!}
<A>__{but gus doesn't stop. he throws himself on top of amanda, roughly forcing her back onto the bed.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{gus!!!}
<A>__{amanda's hands beat at gus' face and back, to no apparent effect. with one arm forced against amanda's throat, he rips open her nightgown with the other. we pull away from amanda's struggles, back to the bathroom. the shower running on and on, cloaking the bedroom in steam.}
