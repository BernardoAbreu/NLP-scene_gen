<A>__{digiacomo sees the blue laser. motions his men to action. return on the sea dolphin ii topside bond has sauntered to one of the hospitality bars, trying to remain ac inconspicuous as possible. a hand clasps his shoulder:}

<D>__{mr. james bond!}
<A>__{bond spins to see valentin, surrounded by the usual assortment of cheaply dressed goons.}

<D>__{valentin. what an unpleasant surprise.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{what is it that brings you to venezia, mr. bond? business }
<P>__{(sly glance to the thugs)}
<D>__{or somebody else's business?}
<A>__{the goons chortle. bond isn't happy with this attention. he clocks a video surveillance camera on one of the masts, scanning the deck. a woman's shrill whining voice brings bond back to valentin. she is very colorfully dressed dripping in high ticket logos.}
<C>__{sofia}
<D>__{dimitri!!! you promised i could go shopping!!}
<C>__{valentin}

<C>__{valentin}
<P>__{(to the bartender)}
<D>__{two vodka martini's. shaken. not stirred.}
<P>__{(to bond)}
<D>__{and you?}
<A>__{bond would rather not drink but knows that any change from his regular behavior might arouse suspicion.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{one.}
<A>__{as the bartender pours:}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i must say, valentin, capitalism seems to be treating you well.}
<C>__{valentin}
<P>__{(belting one back)}
<D>__{i used to sell weapons; now i buy votes.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{off the record.}
<C>__{bond}

<D>__{always nice to meet one of her majesty's fellow subjects...}
<P>__{(a nod to valentin)}
<D>__{especially one with such distinguished friends.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{you might say i've always been one of mr. valentin's biggest followers.}
<C>__{valentin}
<P>__{(chortling)}
<D>__{'biggest followers?' he's practically made a career' of it!!}
<A>__{he laughs. bond decides to pull harmsway's chain.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{it's a beautiful boat, sir elliot. practically glows in the dark.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, mr. bond.}
<P>__{(signaling off camera)}
<D>__{darling! come here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i want you to meet my wife.}
<A>__{a woman appears in frame, her face obscured by a large sun hat. as she reveals her face to the camera and bond }
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{paris harmsway, allow me to introduce you to james bond.}
<A>__{there is a terrified look on her face. harmsway continues, beaming his most insinuating smile:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{but then... i believe you two have already met.}
<A>__{there is a beat an uncomfortable moment when nobody speaks. then police whistles blow! sirens! sound of tires screeching to a halt! the entire party turns to see digiacomo barging his way up the gangplank wearing a ludicrous military uniform, trailed by uzi toting carbinieri, along with his own video and still crews.}
<D>__{digiacomo elliot harmsway: under the auspices of the italian government, i, franco digiacomo }
<P>__{(pauses; smiles at a camera; pop! a flash goes off)}

<P>__{(to his underlings)}
<D>__{seize the boat!}
<A>__{a set of frozen glances goes from bond, to paris, to harmsway.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{i think i suddenly remembered an urgent meeting in moscow.}
<A>__{to everyone's surprise, harmsway guffaws.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{my friends, there's been a terrible mistake.}
<P>__{(putting his arm around digiacomo)}
<D>__{come. let me show you.}
<A>__{and he leads the procession off, through the bulkhead door. bond is left with paris. she is white with fear. bond moves to console her:}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{paris }
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{leave me alone! he's going to kill me!!}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me? why wasn't it in our files?}
<C>__{paris}
<P>__{(anguished)}
<D>__{he didn't want anyone to know. he kept it out of the papers. he said a third wife was bad for his image.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you've got to protect me!}
<A>__{bond wants to help her and follow harmsway. he pulls out a key:}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{go to my hotel room. i will be there in twenty minutes.}
<A>__{paris looks up at him like a hurt child. she wants some contact; she wants to hear him say 'i love you.'}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{just say it. say it just once.}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(pauses, discomfited)}
<D>__{one thing at a time. i will see you in twenty minutes. go.}
<A>__{she exits; he goes to the bulkhead door... and we pan up to see the surveillance camera, following him.}
