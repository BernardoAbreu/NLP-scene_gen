<L>__{exterior parking lot del amo mall day}
<A>__{louis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest, walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars. melanie follows close behind. we stedicam alongside. we walk for awhile, louis changes direction to another aisle. we're now in front of him. we see he has a searching look on his face.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{you have no idea where you parked, do you?}
<A>__{louis doesn't answer. melanie laughs.}
<C>__{melanie }
<D>__{jesus, but if you two aren't the biggest fuck ups i've ever seen in my life... how did you ever rob a bank? when you robbed banks, did you have to look for your car then too? no wonder you went to jail.}
<A>__{louis could kill her right now. just take his gun out of his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. but instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should. he doesn't answer of look back. (if he looked back and saw that melanie smirk, he couldn't e responsible for what happens.)he changes directions, cuts down another aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck up. but our melanie just keeps on being melanie.}
<C>__{melanie }
<D>__{is it this aisle, lou is?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yeah, down the end.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{you sure?}
<A>__{they walk it; it's not it. louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the next one.}
<C>__{melanie }
<D>__{is it this aisle or the next one over?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{this one.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{you sure?}
<A>__{in between two cars, louis spins on her.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{don't say anything else, okay? i'm telling you, keep your mouth shut.}
<A>__{melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say something anyway when louis put his hand up and says;}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i mean it. don't say one fuckin' word.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{okay, lou is.}
<A>__{that did it! louis whips out the beretta ordell gave him, shoots her... bam... in the belly. she bounces off one of the cars and goes down. bam... louis shoots her again on the ground. one; to make sure. two; cause it felt good. then he hurries of for his car. we follow in front of him. he looks around, then yells out;}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{see, just where i fuckin' said it was!}
<A>__{he hops in the car, and throws it into reverse. we can se melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of cars. louis stops the toyota alongside the dead melanie, and yells through the passenger window;}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{hey, look. i found it!}
<A>__{he drives away.}
