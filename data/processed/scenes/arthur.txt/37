<L>__{interior burt's study day later}
<A>__{arthur and the butler enter the large, paneled study.}
<C>__{butler}
<D>__{would you care for anything while you wait?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{a trampoline and a selection of woodland creatures if that's not too much trouble.}
<A>__{the butler leaves. arthur gazes around the room, which is filled with antique christian iconography. the ceiling fan is in the shape of a cross. a large, scary jesus statue, palms outstretched, stares at him from beside a fish tank. he sees a cocktail cabinet.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{ah!}
<P>__{(to jesus)}
<D>__{shhhhh...}
<A>__{he opens the cabinet. nothing but bottles of water.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{bollocks.}
<P>__{(to jesus)}
<D>__{sorry. actually, you couldn't, um....you know...}
<P>__{(points to the water)}
<D>__{...turn this into a nice 1990 romanee conti, could you?}
<A>__{he sips the water as if it's wine. lifts it to jesus.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{cheers ears.}
<A>__{he checks out a huge, very old, rusty sword on the wall. beneath it is a small information plaque.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{`genuine sword of the first crusade. excavated germany, 1972'.}
<A>__{he looks around, then reaches up and takes it off. it's very heavy and clanks to the ground, slamming his foot.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{jesus fucking christ!}
<P>__{(to jesus)}
<D>__{sorry. it's not like you shouted `arthur fucking bach' when they pinned you up. sorry. sore subject.}
<A>__{arthur lifts the sword again, brandishing and twirling it, making the noise of a star wars light sabre.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{feel the force, luke.}
<A>__{he swings it in a full arc...clunk! arthur has decapitated jesus! where's the head? the door opens. burt johnson, a large, imposing man with a tiny crucifix around his neck, fills the doorway.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{arthur!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i, er, had a bit of food stuck in my teeth and couldn't find a toothpick.}
<A>__{burt, unperturbed, takes the sword from arthur.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{heck, this sword went through three crusades. beheaded 1000 moslems. nothing you can do to harm it.}
<A>__{burt walks straight past headless jesus to the water cabinet. arthur looks around desperately for the head.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you don't, um, have anything stronger, do you?}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{sparkling.}
<A>__{arthur laughs nervously. but burt's not joking.}
<C>__{burt }
<D>__{`the drunkard and the glutton shalt come to poverty: and drowsiness shalt clothe a man with rags.'}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{surely a glass of sherry at christmas?}
<A>__{burt clinks glasses with him.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{peace be with you.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and also with me.}
<A>__{he sees jesus's head! it's sitting on top of one of the blades of the ceiling fan!}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{arthur. can i be honest with you?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you're the real slim shady? i knew it!}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{my faith teaches me to hate the sin, not the sinner. but with you, i struggle with that belief.}
<A>__{burt turns away to get a glass of water.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you could switch to judaism.}
<P>__{(glances up at the fan)}
<D>__{bit warm in here. do you mind if i put the fan on?}
<A>__{arthur turns the fan on a low setting. it rotates slowly, the head going around with it. burt turns away to pour more water. arthur grabs the moment to speed up the fan again, until it's going fast enough and jesus's head falls off. arthur catches it. arthur gets behind burt, out of sight temporarily.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{anyway, arthur. however i feel about you, my daughter loves you.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yes, it's a problem, isn't it?}
<A>__{arthur reaches out and, unseen by burt, he reaches out of shot and puts the head back on jesus's body.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{let's knock our heads together and find a way to stop her loving me....got it! we'll tell her i'm on the sex offenders register....no, i am and she knows.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{joke, sorry. ah. we'll say i'm gay! i did once dabble actually, so i can tell a plausible story.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{you made love to a guy?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{one moslem doesn't make a mosque, burt.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{you made love to a moslem?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{no, sir, it was prince alois of lichtenstein and he made love to me. the fact that it took three bottles of poppers and a jacuzzi full of krug to loosen me up confirmed my heterosexuality.}
<A>__{arthur notices that jesus's head is on backwards. burt picks up a bible from his desk and quotes from memory.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{`if there is a man who lies with a male, they shall surely be put to death.'}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{crikey. couldn't there just be some kind of on the spot fine?}
<A>__{burt really hammers the table this time.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{you will stop this talk and marry my fucking...}
<A>__{jesus's head falls off. arthur peers around. it's nowhere!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{oh bollocks.}
<A>__{both arthur and burt see jesus's head at the bottom of the fish tank. it floats back up to the top.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{it's a miracle! he is risen!}
<A>__{but susan, burt's beautiful daughter, enters with her best friend erica who arthur met whilst at the restaurant the other night.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{hi susan. erica.}
<A>__{burt looks from jesus's head to the sword, figuring it out.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{sorry to make you wait, arthur. i was talking to your mother. i hear you have something to ask me!}
<A>__{arthur feels burt's smiling face and hating eyes on him.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{shall we go?}
