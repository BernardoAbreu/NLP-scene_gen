<L>__{interior apartment staircase morning}
<A>__{our four at the curator's door. bloom knocks, and they all step judiciously back. no response.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{max?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{we're a little early...}
<L>__{interior the curator's aparment morning}
<A>__{still and silent in the breaking light of morning. and totally empty. picked clean down to the bare walls. the only thing left in the apartment is the painting of the well... broken on the floor. our intrepid four stand in various states of thoughtfulness. penelope stares at the painting, bloom at the window.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{the golem came for him. in my dream. crawled out of the painting and killed him in a horrible way.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{well at least he had the decency to just skip out on us, not do something tacky like fake his own death.}
<A>__{poking around the room, bloom opens a closet. the curator stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas.}
<C>__{the curator}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{you're a little early.}
<A>__{bloom quickly closes it.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i don't get it. if he was hightailing it he could have waited eight hours till we traded the million for the book, and had some traveling money. well. back to antiquing. nothing gained, nothing lost.}
<P>__{(to penelope)}
<D>__{and you got to see prague, which is nice.}
<A>__{penelope's eyes widen with realization.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{you should stay in the city for awhile, they have these amazing puppet show opera things }
<A>__{but stephen raises a hand to shut him up.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{oh?}
