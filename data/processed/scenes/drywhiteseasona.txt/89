<L>__{interior court room first day of inquest day}
<A>__{the inquest of gordon ngubene... conducted by magistrate klopper. in the witness box is dr. jansen, the state pathologist, giving evidence. advocate de villiers is cross examining.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{dr. jansen, you are a state pathologist of many years standing and i have no doubt a well qualified pathologist. could you now please tell us what caused the death of the deceased?}
<C>__{dr. jansen}
<D>__{i found that death had been caused by the application of force to the neck, consistent with hanging.}
<A>__{there's a vigorous reaction to this around the court, which gives us a chance to discover the crowd: in the white section of the public gallery are ben and about eight other whites. the black section is filled to capacity with a few stand ing. in the front row is sitting stanley next to margaret. at the entrance, a white policeman. in the press section are several reporters; amongst them melanie bruwer the rand daily mail reporter. colonel viljoen and several policemen are sitting around the court.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{you are sure about the hanging? this pressure on the neck, could it also have been exerted in other ways?}
<C>__{dr. jansen}
<D>__{it could, but it is not for me to speculate.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{of course not, doctor. the list of injuries found on the body was horrifyingly long; bruises, swellings, abrasions, broken rib, lacerations, etc. how long before death do you estimate he received these injuries?}
<C>__{dr. jansen}
<D>__{i couldn't say exactly.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{roughly.}
<C>__{dr. jansen}
<D>__{some were fourteen to twenty days old, others three to four days and others even more recent.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{even more recent. i see. i understand you had a dr. hassiem present at the autopsy.}
<C>__{dr. jansen}
<D>__{that's correct.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{there were two reports, ours and his. did they tally?}
<C>__{dr. jansen}
<D>__{yes, it was. in most respects.}
<A>__{on stanley listening.}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{isn't it normal practice to have one report? why did dr. hassiem decide to draw up a separate report? if he really co signed yours.}
<C>__{dr. jansen}
<D>__{that's for him to answer!}
<C>__{de villiers}
<D>__{i would very much like to, dr. jansen, but he's been detained you know of course that he represented the ngubene family. thank you.}
<A>__{there's a murmur around the court... ben looks across at viljoen who returns his gaze smiling.}
