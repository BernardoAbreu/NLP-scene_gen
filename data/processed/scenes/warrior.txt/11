<L>__{interior central high school classroom, philadelphia day}
<A>__{brendan stands in a classroom, surrounded by high school students wearing safety goggles and raising cain. a block of wood sits wedged in a vice, and a student, tito, stands over it with a louisville slugger in his hands as his classmates cheer him on.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{whoa whoa whoa! there's a lesson in this too, ok? listen up. so we have a body at rest, and you have the bat which needs }
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{acceleration.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{acceleration, right. if you have enough acceleration, you have might have a chance to break the body at rest. ok. go ahead.}
<A>__{brendan, sleeves rolled up and a bemused look on his face, watches as tito brings the bat down on the wood. as it cracks in half, the other students cheer wildly. tito smiles and leans the bat against a blackboard with "newton's 2nd law of motion" printed on it.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{there we go. alright tito, well done. remind not to mess with you. sit down everybody. dial it down.}
<A>__{as tito high fives his way back through the group, things settle down and the kids take their seats.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{so, have we got it?}
<A>__{a room full of affirmatives, with the cocky voice of nash, a skinny white kid in a flyers jersey, standing out.}
<C>__{nash}
<D>__{force equals mass times acceleration. we got it.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{alright. the third law }
<A>__{a black student, stephon, looks up from his desk.}
<C>__{stephon}
<D>__{how many laws this dude got?}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{the dude? the dude has three. newton the dude says that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.}
<A>__{brendan looks toward the classroom door, where two red and white clad cheerleaders are peering in, then walks over to kc, a blonde cheerleader seated in his class. she is working a blackberry and doesn't notice him approaching.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{for example, if kc does not stop the action of sending texts in class...}
<A>__{brendan stands directly in front of her desk. she quickly shoves the blackberry under a stack of books.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{...and tell her posse outside to beat it...}
<A>__{he turns and shoos away the two cheerleaders peering in the window.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{...then my reaction might be to send her down to principal zito's office. thus setting our world back in proper balance.}
<C>__{kc}
<D>__{mr. c, i put it away.}
<A>__{the class busts on kc as brendan walks back to his desk and sits on top of it. it's clear from the vibe in the room that he's a very popular teacher. then the bell rings.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{alright, before you go, i have your tests from last week.}
