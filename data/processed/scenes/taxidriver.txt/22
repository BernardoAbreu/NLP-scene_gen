<L>__{exterior across the street from headquarters}
<A>__{travis is striding briskly across broadway toward the palantine headquarters. he s dressed the best we have seen him; his pants (not jeans) are pressed, his boots shined, his hair combed. under his army jacket he wears a freshly laundered shirt and ivy league tie. he drops his cigarette, steps on it and walks in. watching travis enter palantine's headquarters, we are surprised to realize that travis is really quite attractive. his deformities are psychological, not physical. he believes he is cursed, and therefore he is. travis walks briskly into the office, and heads toward betsy's desk. tom walks over to greet him, but travis ignores him.}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(at betsy's desk)}
<D>__{i want to volunteer.}
<A>__{as the camera examines travis' face more closely, one can see the hollowness wrought by lack of sleep and sufficient diet.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(at betsy's desk)}
<D>__{if you'll come this way.}
<A>__{travis elbows tom off.}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(to betsy)}
<D>__{no. i want to volunteer to you.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(under his voice)}
<D>__{bets.}
<A>__{betsy waves tom off with a short gesture, indicating everything is ok. he walks away.}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(curious)}
<D>__{and why is that?}
<A>__{travis is on his best behavior. he smiles slightly:}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{because you are the most beautiful woman i have ever seen.}
<A>__{betsy is momentarily taken back, but pleased. travis' presence has a definite sexual charge. he has those star qualities betsy looks for: she senses there is something special about the young man who stands before her. and then, too, there is that disarming smile. he is, as betsy would say, "fascinating".}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{is that so?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but what do you think of charles palantine?}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(his mind elsewhere)}
<D>__{who mam?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{charles palantine. the man you want to volunteer to help elect president.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{oh, i think he's a wonderful man. make a great, great president.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{you want to canvass?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{yes, mam.}
<A>__{betsy is interviewing travis, but she is also teasing him a little, leading him on in a gentle feminine way:}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{how do you feel about senator palantine's stand on welfare?}
<A>__{this takes travis back a bit. he obviously doesn't have the slightest idea what palantine's stand on welfare is, in fact, he doesn't have any idea about politics whatsoever. travis thinks a moment, then improvises an answer:}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{welfare, mam? i think the senator's right. people should work for a living. i do. i like to work. every day. get those old coots off welfare and make 'em work for a change.}
<A>__{betsy does a subtle double take: this isn't exactly palantine's position on welfare. she remain intrigued by travis.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{well, that's not exactly what the senator has proposed. you might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: office work, filing, poster hanging.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i'm a good worker, betsy mam, a real good worker.}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{if you talk to tom, he'll assign you to something.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{if you don't mind, mam, i'd rather work for you.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{well, we're all working tonight.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{well, betsy mam, i drive a taxi at night.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(bolstering courage)}
<D>__{if you don't mind, mam, i'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.}
<A>__{betsy doesn't quite know what to make of travis. she is curious, intrigued, tantalized. like a moth, she draws closer to the flame.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{well, betsy mam, i drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. and i watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and i say to myself, that's a lonely girl. she needs a friend. and i'm gonna be her friend.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<A>__{travis rarely smiles, but when he does his whole face glows. it is as if he is able to tap an inner reserve of charm unknown even to himself. betsy is completely disarmed.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{it's just to the corner, mam. in broad daytime. nothing can happen. i will be there to protect you.}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{all right.}
<P>__{(relents)}
<D>__{all right. i'm taking a break at four o'clock. if you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{oh, i appreciate that, betsy mam. i will be here at four o'clock exactly.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{and... ah... betsy...}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{my name is travis.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{thank you, travis.}
<A>__{travis nods, turns and exits. tom, who has been watching this interchange with a pseudo standoffish (actually jealous) air, steps over to betsy. his manner demands some sort of explanation of what betsy was doing. betsy simply shrugs (it's really none of his business) and says:}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i'm just going to find out what the cabbies are thinking.}
