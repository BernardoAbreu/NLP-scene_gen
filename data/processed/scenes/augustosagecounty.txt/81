<L>__{interior weston house continuous}
<D>__{finds violet still at the table, lighting a cigarette.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{we couldn't let ivy run off with little charles. just wouldn't be right. barbara doesn't respond, keeps her distance.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{she'll be back. she's a sweet girl, ivy, and i love her to death. but she isn't strong. not like you. or me.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you knew about daddy and mattie fae?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh sure. i never told them i knew. but your father knew. he knew i knew. but we never talked about it. i chose the higher ground.}
<P>__{(and then)}
<D>__{if i'd had the chance, there at the end, i would've told him, "i hope this isn't about little charles, cause you know i know all about that." if i'd reached him at that motel, i would've said, "you'd be better off if you quit sulking about this ancient history."}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{...what motel?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i called over there on monday after i got into that safety deposit box. but it was too late, he'd checked out.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{how did you know where he was? violet is growing agitated with the interrogation.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{the note. he said i could call him over at the country squire motel }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{he left a note?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{and i did, i called him on monday.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{after you got the money out of your safety deposit box...}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{we had an arrangement. you have to understand, for people like your father and me, who never had any money, ever, as kids, people from our generation, that money is important.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{if you could've stopped daddy from killing himself, you wouldn't have needed to get into your safety deposit box.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{well, hindsight's always twenty twenty, isn't it? barbara stares at her mother for a long moment. then }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{did the note say he was going to kill himself? no response.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{mom?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{if i had my wits about me, i might've done it different. but i was, your father and me both, we were... barbara looks off, quietly:}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you were both fucked up... you were fucked up... you are fucked up.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you'd better understand this, you smug little ingrate. there's only one reason beverly killed himself and that's you. think there's any way he would've done what he did if you were still here? no, just him and me, here in this house, in the dark, left to ourselves, abandoned, wasted lifetimes devoted to your care and comfort.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{so stick that knife of judgment in me, go ahead, but make no mistake, his blood is just as much on your hands as it is on mine. barbara is reeling, trying to comprehend.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{he did this though, not us. can you imagine anything more cruel, to make me responsible? just to weaken me, make me prove my character? so i waited, to get my hands on that safety deposit box. but i would have waited anyway. you want to show who's stronger, bev? nobody's stronger than me, goddamn it. when nothing is left, when everything is gone and disappeared, i will be here. violet yells up to the empty house.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{who's stronger now, you son of a bitch?! barbara feels sick, the floor giving away beneath her. she takes a moment. then:}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you're right, mom. you're the strong one. she goes to her mother, kisses her. turns, heads into the hall, grabs her purse and bev's keys from the dish. violet only slowly realizes barbara's gone.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{...barbara? hears the sound of the screen door opening and slapping shut.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{barbara? violet follows her into the hall, stops at the screen door.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{you and me. we're alike. barb doesn't turn around, keeps moving. quietly:}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{no... sees barb heading across the yard for beverly's pick up.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{barbara, please.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i'm nothing like you...}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{please, barbara. watches barbara climb into the truck, back slowly out, go.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{...barbara? barbara drives off. the driveway now empty again. violet alone outside on the walkway. she turns back to the house, yelling, moving from empty room to empty room.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{ivy?! ivy, you here?! silence. the dining room, the kitchen.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{barb?! ivy?! and into the living room, bev's study.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{bev?! ...bev?! she stumbles to the stereo, puts on her clapton... stares at the spinning album...}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{johnna?! she reels to the stairs, crawling up }
