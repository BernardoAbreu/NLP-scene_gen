<L>__{interior walter's house, living room later}
<A>__{walter sits at the piano and practices. it is still going badly. the wine glass sits on top of the piano. he lifts his hand and inspects his "tunnel".}
<L>__{interior connecticut college:}
<A>__{, walter's office day walter is at his computer. he pulls up his year syllabus on the computer and carefully changes 2005 to 2006. he saves it. his work is done. there is a knock at the door.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the door opens and walter's colleague, charles van horn steps in.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{hello walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{charles.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i'm sorry to interrupt.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{that's ok.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{walter, shelley can't make it down to the nyu conference to present your paper. i'm going to need you to cover for her.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{why can't she go?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{she's been put on bed rest until she has the baby.}
<A>__{walter is caught off guard.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{next week. we'll cover your class and make the arrangements.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i wish i could, but now is not a very good time, charles.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i understand but you co authored the paper and the dean wants it presented. he wants to keep shelley on track for tenure.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i just don't think i can with the start of classes and my book.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{you're only teaching one class, walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{so i can stay focused on my writing. i'd really rather not go right now.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i'm sorry but there really isn't another option at this pointerior}
<A>__{walter is trapped. he comes clean.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{charles, the truth is this is really shelley's paper. i just agreed to co author it because she asked me to. i'm not really prepared to present it.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{that may be the case but you are the co author and she can't go. look walter, you can take it up with the dean if you want, but, as your friend, i wouldn't advise it. not with that argument.}
<A>__{walter just stares him.}
<C>__{charles }
<D>__{good bye.}
<A>__{and charles is gone, shutting the door behind him.}
