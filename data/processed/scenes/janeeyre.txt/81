<L>__{interior day. thornfield the kitchens.}
<A>__{jane sets down several bottles of wine on the kitchen table in order to dust them. the kitchen is a hive of activity except for one lone figure sitting quietly in a chair by the fire, smoking a pipe; grace poole. leah and one of the hired under cooks are talking abut her.}
<C>__{under cook}
<D>__{she gets good wages, i'd guess?}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{wish i had as good; not one fifth what mrs poole receives.}
<A>__{jane affects not to listen, but is keenly interested.}
<C>__{leah }
<D>__{and she's laying it all by. i shouldn't wonder if she's saved enough to keep her independent.}
<C>__{under cook}
<D>__{she's a good hand, i daresay.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{not everyone could do it, that's for sure, not even for the money.}
<C>__{under cook}
<D>__{no wonder the master relies on her }
<A>__{leah notices jane's curious glance. she nudges the under cook. jane, picks up the bottles and carries them away. as she passes she hears:}
<C>__{under cook }
<D>__{doesn't she know?}
<A>__{at that moment, adele rushes in.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{they're here! they're here!}
<A>__{mrs fairfax tries to get her apron off. she becomes flustered. jane helps her.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{mrs fairfax and adele go. jane looks out of the window. her attention is focussed on two equestrians who lead the arriving party; rochester and blanche, the dark beauty at his side. she is laughing at something. the sun shines behind her. jane is dazzled. she turns away.}
