<A>__{a green and lavender sunset. in the middle of nowhere, the postman rides, chewing a piece of jerked beef. he flips through some of the letters entrusted to him.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{eugene. benning. portland.}

<D>__{seattle. boise... st. rose, paradise on the pacific...}
<A>__{he considers the letter, looks around as if someone may be watching. he just begins to tear the corner, then stops.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{maybe one thing can still be sacred.}
<P>__{(to horse)}
<D>__{all in all, not a bad gig, huh?}
<A>__{the horse snorts. smiling, the postman shoves the envelope into his bag. as he does, he finds something else. the red ribbon. he runs it through his fingers, thinks wistfully of abby. then, like a knight of old representing a lady's honor, he ties it to his mailbag and rides on.}
