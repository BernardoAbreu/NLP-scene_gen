<A>__{beau flees. judy turns without another glance at her parents, and opens the door of her room. inside bedroom of judy's parents. as judy slams her bedroom door o.s., the father reacts. perhaps, he wishes she had given him a chance to say goodnight. the mother, who use reading glasses, looks up at the slam. then she looks over at her husband, shrugs when she catches his gaze, and goes back to her magazine. inside jim's living room. the television is on, but only a hum comes from it, and the screen is a flickering gray. the father sits lumpily in a chair by the fireplace, still dressed but with his collar open. the sound of jim's step in the dining room makes him open his eyes. fear of facing his son makes him shut them again. the boy comes in, a bottle of milk in his hand. seeing his father there, he stops short his impulse is to flee. instead he comes in and looks down at the sleeping man whose eyelids, fluttering in the father's masquerade of sleep, make him seem to be having a dream. jim is torn between his desire to leave and his need to speak. he turns off the television quietly, then lies down on the couch across the way. he mumbles the things he would say to his father and the answers he feels he would get. the old man opens his eyes once, sees the boy there, head banging upside down from the couch. then he shuts them again. upside down long shot. room (jim's viewpoint). suddenly, inverted in his vision, the mother appears at the head of the stairs, in bathrobe and nightgown. she pauses a moment, then runs down crying:}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i told you dad, it was a question of honor. they called me chicken you know, chicken! i had to go or i would never have been able to face any of those kids again. so i got in one of these cars and a boy called buzz got in the other. we had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff. i got out okay but buzz didn't. he was killed.}

<C>__{father}
<D>__{well, just get it off your chest, son.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that's not what i mean. i've never done anything right. i've been going around with my head in a sling for years...i don't want to drag you into this but i can't help it. i don't think i can prove anything by going around pretending i'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{you're absolutely right!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{are you listening to me? you're involved in this! i want to go to the police and tell them i was mixed up in this thing tonight?}

<D>__{are you going to preach now? are we going to have a sermon?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{i'm just explaining what you mean! you can't be an idealist all your life! nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{that's right!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{except yourself!}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{but i am involved! we're all involved, mom! a boy was killed! i don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{you know you did wrong. that's the main thing, isn't it?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no! it's nothing! just nothing! you always told me to tell the truth. you think you can just turn that off?}

<C>__{mother}
<D>__{do i have to spell it out?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you're not going to use me as an excuse again, mom. every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse. now i want to do one thing right and i'm not letting you run away.}
