<L>__{2d 2d interior nursing care center day}
<A>__{through the front doors, we see doug kiss karen again. they finally separate, and doug walks off. then karen walks through the doors into a bright, atrium like lobby area. she waves "hello" to the receptionist. leaning against a desk behind reception is karen's boss alex (40s, american). he's got a phone to his ear it's ringing. an answering machine picks up in japanese. alex mutters and hangs up. then he notices }
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{karen!}
<A>__{she's started up a staircase in the center of the lobby. she turns and comes back down, walking over to alex.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{are you free this afternoon?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i just came by to pick up some books i left here. i'm not scheduled to work today }
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i know. but are you free? do you have class?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(shaking her head:)}
<D>__{just a test to study for. why?}
<A>__{alex smiles, holding out a file.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{your wish has been granted.}
<A>__{karen takes the file and opens it, looking at the first page a picture of an older woman (emma) is attached.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's yoko's case, but she didn't show up for work this morning, and i can't reach her at home. she must be sick, or something. and she has the damn house key.}
<A>__{studying the file, karen squints.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what's this phrase?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{"mild dementia with severe lethargy." apparently she sleeps through most of the day. her daughter in law doesn't work, so she'll probably be there.}
<A>__{karen seems unsure. it's a big step for her.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you're the one who's been bugging me about getting out there on your own. besides, it's an english only house.}
<A>__{one of alex's co workers appears in the doorway, motioning to him. alex quickly hands karen a card:}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{here's the address. use the wall chart if you need help and don't forget to bring a map.}
<A>__{karen looks at the address a string of thirty numbers and japanese characters. she glances up at the wall chart: a color coded diagram shows how the long address string is broken down into postal code, prefecture, city, ward, district, block, sub block and house number.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{don't worry karen, you're ready.}
<A>__{karen nods. but she's not quite as confident.}
