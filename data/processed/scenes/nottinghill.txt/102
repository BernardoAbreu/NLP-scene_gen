<L>__{interior stairs living room day}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{now stop. stop. i beg you calm down. have a cup of tea.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't want a goddamn cup of tea. i want to go home.}
<A>__{the doorbell goes.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{spike, check who that is... and for god's sake put some clothes on.}
<A>__{spike leans merrily out of the window.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{looks like a chauffeur to me.}
<L>__{interior william's kitchen corridor day}
<A>__{they move from the kitchen into the corridor.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{and remember spike owes you an expensive dinner. or holiday depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{that's not true. and wait a minute... this is crazy behavior. can't we just laugh about this? seriously in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{what he's going to say next is there are people starving in the sudan.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{well, there are. and we don't need to go anywhere near that far. my best friend slipped she slipped down stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. all i'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you're right: of course, you're right. it's just that i've dealt with this garbage for ten years now you've had it for ten minutes. our perspectives are different.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i mean today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{well, you know it's just one day. today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you really don't get it. this story gets filed. every time anyone writes anything about me they'll dig up these photos. newspapers last forever. i will regret this forever.}
<A>__{he takes this in. that's the end.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right. fine. i will do the opposite, if it's all right by you and always be glad you came. but you're right you probably better go.}
<A>__{she looks at him. the doorbell goes again. she opens the door. massive noise and photos. outside are her people, including karen, a chauffeur, two bodyguards. and then the door is shut and they're all gone. silence.}
