<L>__{exterior harlin's garage later day}
<A>__{darrell is cleaning his tools. bobby's mustang sits prominently in the car bay, washed and gleaming, as bobby walks up.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{hey there. i was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back... you don't look so good.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah, well, i've been around the bend a bit.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{one of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you've been there?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{hell, i've had days i would gladly trade with a whippin' dog. ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you believe that?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{you think bad, and bad is what you get.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that's a good piece of advice, darrell.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{no charge.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{listen, darrell, about that hundred fifty bucks for the car, as soon as i get where i'm going i swear i will }
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{two hundred.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{it's going to cost you two hundred dollars.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you said this morning the hose was going to run me one fifty.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{yep. for the hose. but while you was gone i replaced a gasket. that's going to run you another fifty.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i didn't tell you to replace any gasket.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{yeah, but it was shot.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i don't give a fuck! i didn't tell you to do it! you can't just do unauthorized work.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you? didn't you read the sign.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what sign?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{the goddamn sign on the wall. i can't do unauthorized work? what am i suppose to do? just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket. then you get in an accident and get killed. or worse. who they gonna blame then? they gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what reputation? you're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{is that an insult? are you insulting me.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{listen you stupid fuck, i want my car.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. you owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until i get it. and if you take another five hours i will find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. is that clear? now get out of here 'fore i call the sheriff, who knows me .}
<A>__{bobby is in a rage. he turns to leave and walks a few paces. he sees a wrench lying on a table. for a second his mind reels, then he snatches up the wrench and turns ready to smash it down on darrell's head. he stops cold. because ol' darrell holds a crowbar in a batter's stance ready to smash it onto the mustang.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{you want to play, mister? i will play with you. you want to smash something? so do i.}
<A>__{darrell pulls back the crowbar, ready to swing.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no! okay! okay!}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{what's the matter? the fight gone out of you? i'm just gonna smash a headlight. maybe two.}
<P>__{bobby (pleading, almost crying)}
<D>__{please, just leave the car alone!}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{mister, you already pissed me off but good.}
<A>__{darrell lays the tip of the crowbar on the hood of the car, and drags the tip of the bar across the hood leaving a long scratch.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{goddamn you! you son of a bitch!}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{there you go, sweet talking me again.}
<A>__{darrell begins to laugh. bobby, desperate, looks to the trunk, thinking of his gun in there. his pov the trunk. a flashback of the gun goes through his mind.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{look, harlin.}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{darrell.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{darrell. i will get you your money. i just have to get something out of the trunk.}
<A>__{using his trunk key, he tries to open it but realizes the lock has been changed.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what the fuck did you do to my trunk?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{well, that key's not gonna work. i had to pop the lock. you didn't leave me the trunk key.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{and you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{when i work on a car, i work on a car.}
<C>__{bobby }
<P>__{you motherfucker! (etc.)}
<C>__{darrell}
<D>__{you can't help yourself, can you mister? you're out of control.}
<A>__{darrell starts to laugh. it is a repetitive, almost demonic laugh that grows louder as the camera slowly dollies in on bobby's anguished face.}
