<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{stay away from here!}
<A>__{we're watching a video monitor. a pre recorded tape shows a view of what is obviously a pristine research laboratory. dr. john marcus, in a lab coat, faces the camera, disheveled and looking like a madman.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{this lab must remain sealed!}
<L>__{int conference room timeless}
<A>__{overhead lamps cast pools of light down onto a conference table, onto the hands of people assembled to observe the video. we see no faces. but expensive watches, sleeves with high ranking stripes, indicate wealth, power, and a military presence. the video: on the wall behind marcus, we see shadows darting frantically. we hear voices rising in panic.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{for god's sake, don't come in!}
<A>__{the camera is swatted by a hand that lurches suddenly into the foreground. we only see it for a few video frames, but we might subliminally notice lesions on the flesh. the image swirls wildly. the next clear picture we see... is of the same laboratory...topsy turvy. the camera is lying on its side on the floor.}
<C>__{voice in the room }
<D>__{look. here.}
<A>__{a laser pointer casts a red dot on a corner of the video screen, indicating a hunched figure, leaning over a human body, apparently ...feeding! with a grunt, the figure turns. and lunges, it's face covered with blood, at the camera. the image swirls again, and the screen goes black. with a music sting, a single title appears, full across the blackness...}
<B>__{resident evil}
<L>__{ext forest land pre dawn}
<A>__{a dark sky ...and in the foreground, profiled against a full moon, a dark face ...watching the heavens with piercing black eyes, alert, though not predatory. this is chris redfield, young, handsome. more than simply an outdoor type, he seems perfectly in place, almost part of the environment. a band of purple tints the horizon, outlining the tops of magnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles. sitting on a ridge, squinting into that band of light, chris sees ... ...an eagle coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through the hilltops. as the bird moves swiftly closer, it becomes recognizable. chris smiles and jots a note on a pad. the regal bird lands on a high rock where ...unexpectedly... a freshwater trout lies flapping, three thousand feet above the highest water.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{take it, goliath. it's yours.}
<A>__{"goliath" snaps up the fish and flies away with it.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{see ya next year, guy.}
<A>__{chris reaches into a water filled bucket, pulls out another trout, climbs efficiently, unerringly, across a precarious cliffside, and deposits the fresh fish on the same high rock. another eagle, smaller, a female, appears in the sky.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{cleopatra.}
<A>__{chris scrambles back to his place and jots another note. "cleopatra" spots the fish, pumps her wings, and swoops down. she's about to snap up the prize, but at the last minute, she recoils and climbs again, hovering.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{come on. come on down.}
<A>__{the eagle circles, its sharp eyes scanning. it makes another dive, but stops short again.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{what's the matter, beautiful?}
<A>__{the bird seems frightened. of what? it makes one more dive. gets very close to the fish... but suddenly shrieks and peels, away from the rock. chris sees its eyes, looking crazed, as it soars right past him, its wings brushing his hair. close on: chris, concerned, as he watches the eagle disappear over the hills. over his shoulder, we can see the high rock that holds the fish. it's out of focus in the background, but the moonlight catches something moving there. something that lets out a sharp inhuman sound. chris whirls around. there's nothing on the rock. nothing at all. the fish has been taken.}
<L>__{int jill's apartment dawn}
<A>__{chris walks into a characterless apartment. he quietly sheds his clothes. even in silhouette, we can see that his body is in perfect shape, not pumped, but lean and tight. moving lithely, with the natural grace of a cat, he eases himself into a bed where... ...a beautiful young girl, jill valentine, seems to be fast asleep. as chris nestles in beside her, we see that her eyes, facing away, are open. chris gently drapes an arm around her and lets his body relax.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(a whisper) glad you're still}
<D>__{here, lady}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{it's my apartment.}

<P>__{(surprised) you're awake.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i've been awake. since you left.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{his apology goes no further. he's still troubled by what happened in the hills.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{there was... something wrong.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{what, with my dinner? i never had a mother. i will learn.}
<A>__{chris smiles politely. he offers...}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i will do the cooking.}
<A>__{...but he can't switch focus.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{on the mountain...there...must have been something... prowling around up there.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{there are probably all kinds of things prowling around up there. in the middle of the night.}
<A>__{chris apologizes again, this time more sincerely.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i'm sorry. really. you...have to be there at dawn. they ride the wind over the ridge.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{dawn? you left at one a.m.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i had to go fishing. it's the fish that bring them down, so i can get}
<P>__{a close look at them. (enthused)}
<D>__{i've tracked a dozen of them, jill. twelve of those big bruisers. i can actually recognize them. i've even given them names, over the years.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{you've been doing this for years?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{only in the early autumn. when they're' migrating.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i'ii set the alarm for nexterior october.}
<A>__{jill rolls over and faces him.}
<C>__{jill }
<D>__{i wish i could get excited. really. that's the truth. as excited as you, over such... simple things.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{beauty... isn't simple. if it was... i'd be beautiful.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{you are.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{no, no, no. i'm simple. you, on the other hand...(nuzzling closer)...have all that... stuff... hiding underneath somewhere. that's what fascinates me.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{fascination. not love?}
<A>__{jill is being playful. chris, taking her question to heart, becomes introspective.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i... honestly don't know. i guess i've been... living alone too long. you're the first, the only woman i've ever thought of as... a real partner.}
<A>__{now jill becomes introspective.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i've always been...afraid of living alone. i've always had... people... talking at me... knowing they could wind me up and i'd do... (shrug) ... whatever they wanted.}
<A>__{chris looks into her eyes. she kisses him gently.}
<C>__{jill }
<D>__{we all have... something hidden... underneath. beauty may not be simple. but it's not all that complicated, either. most of the time, you find it... right in the middle of all the... confusion.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i'm part mohawk. indians are never confused. at least, they never let it show.}
<A>__{they kiss again, this time more passionately. rolling over, they begin to make love.}
<L>__{ext farm dawn}
<A>__{the purple horizon is turning orange, but it's still quite dark when a crusty old farm hand, rake, opens the creaking door of a stable and, with a flashlight, leads three horses out into the morning breeze. two dogs, a lab and a spaniel, romp at his heels as rake opens a log gate. two of the untethered horses trot obediently into a large corral. the third, a beautiful stallion, resists, snorting, tossing its head in high spirit.}
<C>__{rake}
<D>__{get in there, lucky. quit horsin' around. get in.}
<A>__{"lucky" moves into the corral, strutting proudly.}
<C>__{rake }
<D>__{swear. if i didn't know you was just an animal, i'd say you was all full of yourself. get in there!}
<A>__{rake waves his flashlight, not meanly, there is clearly a great deal of affection here. rake shuts the gate behind the stallion, who begins to gallop around happily inside the fence. all seems lovely, until... ...the dogs suddenly go on pointerior their ears perk. they sniff the air...and begin to whine.}
<C>__{rake }
<D>__{what's wrong with you two?}
<A>__{ker raakk! a startling sound. rake turns to find lucky and the other horses, their eyes flaring, trying to kick their way out of the fencing. they seem terrified.}
<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{a wide shot: of rake, and the frightened animals, from two hundred yards away. the camera moves in, slowly at first, then gaining speed... extraordinary speed. we are seeing through the eyes of... whatever it is that's running, charging, slathering hungrily... ...reaching the corral, darting through the fence, past the kicking horses, and leaping at rake, who whirls around...and cries out in pain as his flashlight blinds us with whiteness.}
<L>__{ext air base dawn}
<A>__{the whiteness becomes the glare of halogen lights. we are overwhelmed by the sound of aircraft engines. we see men, armed soldiers, scrambling into combat helicopters. a radio man runs right toward the camera, holding out an open receiver.}
<C>__{radio man}
<D>__{top brass, sir!}
<A>__{another man, in the foreground, takes the radio phone. we can't see his face. only his forearm, which bears a tattoo of a grinning skull.}

<C>__{voice on phone }
<D>__{how long before you get in there?}
<C>__{man with tattoo}
<D>__{fifteen minutes.}
<L>__{int an office dawn}
<A>__{a suit talks on a red telephone. once again, we see no face. an ostentatious diamond ring kicks light as the man snips off the end off a monte cristo.}
<C>__{man with ring}
<D>__{you're good, soldier. but not that good. it's five hundred miles away. in the backwoods of pennsylvania.}
<C>__{man with tattoo }
<D>__{we have troopers on site. a first strike force. under cover.}

<L>__{int jill's apartment morning}
<A>__{chris sleeps. jill is awake, deep in thought, when... ...brrrrt! it's not a ring, it's a vibration. jill reaches down and extracts something small and black, the size of a box of tic tacs, from one of her shoes. she gets out of bed, checking to see that chris is still asleep, and moves into...}

<P>__{i will strangle you. (she listens)}
<D>__{shit. give me the activation code.}

<P>__{(gaping, not believing) th that's}
<D>__{a match. (beat) i'm on my way.}
<A>__{jill clicks off. she dumps something else from the envelope into her hand... a blue plastic card, the size of a visa, blank except for a mag stripe. there's a small hole in one corner, through which a chain is strung. jill slings the chain over head, wearing the blue card like a pendant.}
<L>__{int jill's apartment morning}
<A>__{chris is still asleep. jill comes out of the bathroom and looks down at him longingly. should she wake him? tell him what's happening? she wants to, but duty prevents it. she pulls herself away.}

<A>__{tchik tchik tchik...jill pushes aside hangers which hold her clothes. she types numbers into a hidden keypad. a secret panel opens, revealing a closet within the closet, packed with combat uniforms and weapons.}
<L>__{int jill's apartment morning}
<A>__{the sound... tchung... of the front door closing snaps chris awake. his first thought is for his lover. he reaches out and finds that... she's not in bed. he jumps up, rushes to a window, looks down, from the second story, and sees...}
<L>__{ext jill's apartment morning}
<A>__{...jill, heavily armed, in uniform, wearing a beret that has an insignia... s.t.a.r.s. she rushes down the front path and jumps into a hummer with three other troopers on board. the vehicle pulls instantly away... ...leaving chris, looking through the window, puzzled, angry, and very much wounded.}

<L>__{ext the forest morning}
<A>__{deep in the heart of the mist... the hummer bounces over non roads and stops fifty yards from... ...a pair of iron gates, each wrought with the letter "a". beyond, the shifting fog offers momentary glimpses of... a mansion. huge. like xandau. the troopers, amazed, climb out and approach the gates.}

<C>__{disimone}
<D>__{from what? this area's been 'secure' since the french and indian war!}
<A>__{a deep, animal snarl comes from the woods. the troopers raise their weapons as they peer into the underbrush. the fog keeps sunlight from penetrating. the forest is a maze of dark shadows. leaves flutter. limbs snap. then... dark shapes can be seen moving, circling. a half dozen of them. maybe more. jill whips out a transmitter and quickly types an access code.}
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(into radio) this is valentine,}
<D>__{bravo team. we, er... we might be in trouble, here.}
<A>__{kritch! something leaps out of the brush. automatic weapons spit reflexively. kritch kritch kritch...more lunging shaes appear. the troopers scatter, firing, as they are attacked from all sides. jill dives for the shrubbery, shouting into her transmitter.}

<A>__{static. hissing air. the shot widens as the man lowers his headset. first we see the tattoo on his arm... a grinning skull which we recognize. then, gradually, we see his face. lean and mean, wearing dark sunglasses, this is albert wesker, a hard assed career officer.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{can you get a trace?}
<A>__{the pilot, laguardia, responds.}
<C>__{laguardia}
<D>__{lost the beacon. it just cut out. like it was...swallowed by something.}
<A>__{oddly, wesker smiles.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{i do believe, gentlemen...that we're gonna be earning some combat pay.}
