<A>__{they shake. dupree shoots a look at elmore, not pleased. elmore, pissy, leans against the wall, arms crossed. reed, wound out, worn thin, half drunk his bedspread is papered with writs, summons, notaries, etc: everything to make buddy israel's return to custody legally binding. he sits on the edge of the bed, reaching for a pack of smokes on the nightstand, finding a half empty glass of scotch.}
<C>__{reed}
<P>__{(to deeks)}
<D>__{so jack tells me you're both ex cops?}

<D>__{man the stories you guys must tell. i grew up soft myself, private schools, little blazers, you "talked it out" nobody threw punches, t'this day, never been hit with a fist, imagine that, huh?}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{pretty much a panty waste, trembling little faggot fairy when i smell trouble and i don't say this to be self deprecating, i just don't have much of an opinion about myself, i mean, shit, i wish i was a lot more like you guys, barfighters, big swinging dicks, gettin' it done. sadly.}
<P>__{(lifts his shirt, exposes torso flab)}
<D>__{this is it. it's...disgusting.}
<P>__{(with a look skyward)}
<D>__{thanks god, dogpile a piss poor physique with an small cock and hereditary alcoholism! 'preciate it!}
<P>__{(beat, to dupree)}
<D>__{okay, i'm babbling, i do this when i drink, forgive the rants, let's get at it here. this wanted felon fucking prick bastard buddy israel and the nearly one million dollar bail bond.}
<A>__{dupree smiles, pats reed on the shoulder, don't sweat this...}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{rip, my right hand to god, we're gonna go in and recover this asshole and everybody's gonna leave the theater grinning. trust me.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{that confidence translates bro, seriously, it does! out standing!}
<A>__{reed, white boy high five, excruciatingly un hip. deeks and elmore literally have to look away. dupree can barely bear it.}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{i'm a lawyer, y'know, i need to hear these things, little boosts, helps allay my fears, i pass that piece of mind along to my partners.}
<P>__{(beat, then)}
<D>__{alright, so, couple primers for you guys, maybe things we might've looked past that you should know about...his hangers on, these idiots israel runs with, they're all "packing heat" "strapped" whatever the phrase is. point two, israel likes hookers, so you might run into a harem up there. point three: he binges between a six to seven thousand dollar a day cocaine habit that nobody knows about, so he}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{and those hookers, will most likely be high. he also drinks, self medicates, the whole cliche, y'know? the strung out hasbeen jerkoff snitch drunk. the seven layer loser.}
<P>__{(beat, exhales)}
<D>__{i'm praying he puts up a fight, please, please, please, rape him if possible, i will pay the extra whatever }
<A>__{nobody knows what to make of reed, as he giggles, nods, smokes, nods, drinks he looks at all of them, a sudden unexpected wave of enthusiasm seizing him.}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{yeah yeah yeah. fucking hell, this feels great! yeah!? doesn't it!}
<A>__{reed begins laughing like a complete fucking loon, like he's just lost it completely. it's paralyzingly uncomfortable. then, just like that, he stops, grabs an envelope.}
<C>__{reed }
<P>__{(hands envelope over)}
<D>__{okay, we had a retainer, for services to be rendered...fifty thousand dollars.}
<A>__{reed hands the envelope to a smiling dupree.}
<C>__{israel }
<D>__{fifty fucking grand!}
