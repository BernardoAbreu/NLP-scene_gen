<A>__{close on the pick up's tires skidding to a stop. pull out to see we're back at old fred's.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{earl is staring wide eyed. val follows earl's gaze and is aghast when he sees the sheep pen it's a ghastly, bloody mess. scattered on the churned up ground a few dismembered sheep legs and heads are all that remain of the flock.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{what the hell...?}
<A>__{val and earl leap out of the truck to investigate.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{hey, old fred! fred! where are you?!}
<A>__{earl dashes into fred's house. val checks around outside. earl comes back out.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{not here.}
<A>__{then they spot something lying in the middle of the garden old fred's hat. still looking all around, val squats distractedly to pick up the hat. he and earl stumble backward in shock. old fred is still wearing his hat!! his mangled face stares up at them, eyes and mouth frozen open in a death grimace.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{oh, jesus!!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{what the hell is going on? i mean what the hell is going on?!!}
