<L>__{interior max's apartment night}
<A>__{max stares suspiciously at the bathroom. he slowly picks up his drill. wielding it like a hammer, he carefully advances into the bathroom where he looks into the sink. he almost vomits when he sees a piece of human brain sitting above the drain. ants swarm across its surface. max becomes furious. he whacks it with the drill. blood flies up into his face. in a wild rage, he smashes it and punches it. then he drops the drill and uses his bare hands to shove it down the drain. screaming like a madman, he jams it until it is gone.}
