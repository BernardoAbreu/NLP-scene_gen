<L>__{interior baxter building transformation lab day}
<A>__{reed enters the room carrying a stack of boxes that no normal man could balance. but he is not normal. his arms are wrapped around the boxes five times over like human twine. he stops short, and drops the boxes when he sees... victor overseeing a group of technicians. they are boxing up reed's work all of his equipment, research. victor wears a bandage, covering his scar. reed eyes a glint of metal.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{victor, are you...are you okay?}
<A>__{victor turns away.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{don't worry about me. worry about yourself.}
<A>__{reed looks around, seeing his lab turned inside out.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{what i should have done a long time ago. applications and patents, reed. this all belongs to me.}
<A>__{reed reaches out, grabbing a folder from a box.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{but i'm not done with the machine }
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{which is precisely the pointerior analysis is over. it's time for action. my men could have mass produced this by now.}
<A>__{reed shakes his head, defending himself.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{mass produced? this isn't a toaster. you have no idea how it works.}
<A>__{victor pulls the folder from reed's hand, and whips out the intricate diagram of the machine. he points to parts:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{re create the storm, invert the polarity here, reverse the mutation there. don't talk to me like i'm some schoolboy. i've got the same phd you do.}
<A>__{reed is a little surprised that victor is so familiar with his machine. he points to a secure chamber on the blueprinterior}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{the storm needs to be handled exactly right, or it could make our mutations worse, much worse, maybe even kill us...}
<A>__{victor slows. is reed getting to him? or giving him ideas?}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{victor, please. we need time to verify the data... we can't afford any mistakes there's only enough ions for two or three attempts.}
<A>__{victor considers. he seems to enjoy watching reed dangle.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{reed. i'm not asking permission.}
<P>__{(a final verdict)}
<D>__{we'll build it, while you check the specs.}
<A>__{victor walks out. reed looks unsure, as we cut to : }
