<L>__{interior main bedroom ranch day}
<A>__{the chink wakes up and is being cared for by sissy. he is in pain, but winking.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{is everything getting worse?}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{yes, everything is getting worse. but everything is also getting better.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{the countess has come to our aid. the rubber rose ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. and i have been asked to oversee the ranch. for $300 a week. and as it turns out, the countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!}
<A>__{sissy shows a picture of the countess recovering in a hospital bed, posing next to doctor robbins.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{i want to go back to the clock people. i kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. what's happened to jelly?}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{she had a one way ticket to kansas city.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{you mean she's dead?}
<A>__{the chink mourns a bit.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{but that's an old story now...... i can't believe that you would leave the butte.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{easy come, easy go.}
<C>__{delores}
<D>__{wow, you sure have a way with words.}
<A>__{the chink looks over and sees that delores is standing in the doorway.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{i can't help it if i grew up in an antipoetic culture. language will be different when i'm with the clock people though. they're from an oral tradition. and i'm not talking about what you horny hop toads do in bed every night.}
<A>__{the chink smiles. delores blushes.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{well, if the clock people give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{the world isn't going to end, you dummy; i hope you know that much.}
<P>__{(he grows}
<D>__{uncharacteristically}
<P>__{serious)}
<D>__{but it is going to change. it's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. the clock people see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. but there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. it isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. so the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. little pockets of humanity. like the clock people. like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on siwash cave. there's almost no worldwide calamity famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield that you couldn't survive in that cave.}
<A>__{he begins to caress sissy's belly. his eyes are smiling. sissy is surprised.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. all in siwash cave. in a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. a tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. a tribe of big thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. it could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. it would have to rely on its wits and its senses. it would have to live with animals and plants! as virtual equals. it's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{how am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when i'm living on an isolated ridgetop with delores?}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{that's your problem.}
<A>__{the chink coughs.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{listen to the way i'm babbling. that bullet must have loosened one of my transistors. don't pay any attention to me. you've got to work it out for yourself. the westbound choo choo leaves mottburg at one forty. i want to be on it. will you drive me to the station?}
