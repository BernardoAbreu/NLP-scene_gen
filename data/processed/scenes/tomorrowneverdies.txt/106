<L>__{4) she's a smart ass. he decides to see if he can rattle her:}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{actually, i'm here on business. you might say it was a... golden opportunity.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(a chill in her voice)}
<D>__{and exactly what business are you in, mr. bond?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{insurance. lloyds of london.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(daggers in her voice)}
<D>__{the strait can be a very dangerous place, mr. bond. a few words scribbled on a piece of paper in london doesn't carry a lot of value out here. including life insurance.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i will keep that in mind.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(looking off)}
<D>__{i see my date is here.}
<P>__{(to taro)}
<D>__{and i think mr. bond is ready to leave.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{nice to run into you again.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{let's not make it a habit.}
<A>__{she exits. turning his back on taro, bond watches her cross the room. taro places a huge hand on bond's shoulder }
<C>__{taro}
<D>__{i think you should go }
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{not quite yet, taro }
<A>__{and from bond's pov sidney greets harmsway with a big hug.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{uncle elliot!!}
<A>__{watching this, bond seethes with memory of paris and his hatred of harmsway. taro tightens his grip }
<C>__{taro}
<D>__{i said you should }
<A>__{but before he finishes, bond spins, and: 1) slams taro's head on the bar, 2) snatches the ice pick from the bartender, 3) yanks taro back ward by his collar, 4) slams the ice pick through taro's tie into the wooden bar, and 5) kicks the stool out from under the goon. taro is now hanging by his tie, from the bar, choking. bond takes a moment to straighten his own bow tie. wade appears, jubilant, with a wad of cash:}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{yo! jimbo! i won five hundred }
<P>__{(seeing taro)}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{he tied one on.}
