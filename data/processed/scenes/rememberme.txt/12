<L>__{exterior central park afternoon}
<A>__{at the alice in wonderland statue where kids climb all over the faded bronze mushroom caps and characters. the statue is warm, the bronze absorbing the late spring sun. tyler is perched on the mad hatter, his face turned towards the sun while caroline hides with the dormouse. tyler lights a cigarette. an uptight mommy glares at him.}
