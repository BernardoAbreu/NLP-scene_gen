<L>__{exterior tropical lagoon day}
<A>__{a 135 foot luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a tropical lagoon. the beach is a stunning crescent of white sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.}
<C>__{isla sorna}
<D>__{87 miles southeast of nublar}
<A>__{two ship hands, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully laying out luncheon service fine china, silver, crystal decanters with red and white wine. paul bowman, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side, reading. mrs. bowman, painfully thin, with the perpetually surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than once, supervises the settings of the table. she looks up and sees a little girl, cathy, seven or eight years old, wandering off down the beach.}
<C>__{mrs. bowman}
<D>__{cathy! don't wander off!}
<A>__{cathy keeps wandering.}
<C>__{mrs. bowman }
<D>__{cathy, come back! you can look for shells right here!}
<A>__{cathy gestures, pretending she can't hear.}
<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(eyes still in his book)}
<D>__{leave her alone.}
<C>__{mrs. bowman}
<D>__{what about snakes?}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{there's no snakes on a beach. let her have fun, for once.}
<A>__{further down the beach, cathy keeps wandering away, muttering to herself as her parents' quarreling voices fade in the distance.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{please be quiet, please be quiet please be quiet...}
<A>__{rounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view behind her. a rustling sound draws her attention, and she turns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the sand. a large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches swaying and shaking. curious, cathy walks up to the bush, which abruptly stops moving. a small, lizard like animal, dark green with brown stripes along its back, steps out from the bush. only about a foot tall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail. it walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{well, hello there!}
<A>__{the animal (a compsognathus) just stares at her. cathy squats down on her haunches.}
<C>__{cathy }
<D>__{what are you? a little bird or something?}
<A>__{she opens her hand. she's got a handful of goldfish crackers.}
<C>__{cathy }
<D>__{are you hungry? you want a goldfish?}
<A>__{the compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously.}
<C>__{cathy }
<D>__{come on. i won't hurt you.}
<A>__{the compy draws closer. cathy holds the cracker in the palm of her hand. the compy gets closer still and hops numbly up onto cathy's palm. her arm dips a bit under the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up easily. it bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats it. enchanted, cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her hand, calling back over her shoulder.}
<C>__{cathy }
<D>__{mom! dad! you gotta come see this! i found something!}
<A>__{she turns back. thirty more compys have come out onto the sand. they're standing there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few feet away. cathy's smile fades. she turns her head slowly to the right. twenty more compys have come in from that side, forming a semi circle, bobbing and chipping as they surround her.}
<C>__{cathy }
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{what do you guys want?}
<A>__{back on the beach, the table is set. mrs. bowman calls out.}
<C>__{mrs. bowman}
<D>__{cathy, sweetheart! lunch is ready!}
<A>__{from around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolts from the jungle trees as cathy's shrill screams suddenly pierce the air.}
<C>__{mrs. bowman}
<D>__{paul!}
<A>__{she takes off, running down the beach, mr. bowman leaps out of his chair and follows, and all available deck hands race off to help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them. down the beach, mrs. bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend in the beach. we don't see what she sees, but we hear the frenzied squeaking of the strange compys. mr. bowman and the hands race past her to help cathy as mrs. bowman lets loose a horrified, slack jawed scream, her mouth a perfect oval.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior board room day}
<A>__{mrs. bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the yawning face of a bored corporate executive, twenty other executives sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a monied corporation. all are in expensive suits, most are over sixty. there are rows of backbenchers too, whispering in their lawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their ears. empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table hint that everyone's been here a long time. a familiar voice resounds through the boardroom as we move down the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{the hurricane seemed like a disaster at the time, but now i think it was a blessing, nature's way of freeing those animals from their human confines. of giving them another chance to survive, but this time as they were meant to, without man's interference.}
<A>__{the source of the voice is john hammond, the founder of ingen and creator of jurassic park. but he's not in the room. his image is on a closed circuit tv screen, which has been wheeled up to the end of the table. and he doesn't look good. he's terribly infirmed, propped up in bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment beeping around him.}
<C>__{hammond }
<D>__{there are some corporate issues that are not about the bottom line. we have so much still to learn about those creatures. a whole world of intricate, interlocking behaviors, vanished everywhere except for site b. please. let's not do what is good for more men at the expense at what is best for all mankind.}
<A>__{the chairman, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.}
<C>__{chairman}
<D>__{thank you, john. mr. ludlow?}
<A>__{he turns to peter ludlow, late thirties, a man with the anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk. ludlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white eight by tens, and tosses them on the table.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<P>__{(an accent similar to hammond's)}
<D>__{these pictures were taken in a hospital in costa rica forty eight hours ago, after an american family on a yacht cruise stumbled onto site b. the little girl will be fine, but her parents are wealthy, angry, and very fond of lawsuits. but that's hardly new to us, is it?}
<P>__{(takes a paper from the file)}
<D>__{wrongful death settlements, partial list: family of donald gennaro, 36.5 million dollars; family of robert muldoon, 12.6 million. damaged or destroyed equipment, 17.3 million. demolition, de construction, and disposal of isla nublar facilities, organic and inorganic, one hundred and twenty six million dollars. the list goes on, gentlemen research funding, media payoffs. silence is expensive.}
<A>__{he's warming up. not a bad performer.}
<C>__{ludlow }
<D>__{this corporation has been bleeding from the throat for four years. you, our board of directors, have set patiently and listened to ecology lectures while mr. hammond signed your checks and spent your money. you have watched your stock drop from seventy eight and a quarter to nineteen flat with no good and in sight. and all along, we have held a significant product asset that we could have safely harvested and displayed for profit. enormous profit.}
<A>__{he reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove, sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of them. it's a mini mall version of a zoo. cages hold tiny replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while boy scout troops and tourists look on in wonder.}
<C>__{ludlow }
<D>__{enough money to wipe out four years of lawsuits and damage control and unpleasant infighting, enough to not only send our stock back to where it was but to double it. and the one thing, the only thing standing between us and this asset is a born again naturalist who happens to be our own ceo. well, i don't work for mother nature. i work for you.}
<A>__{two of his backbenchers distribute documents from a stack. ludlow takes one and reads from it.}
<C>__{ludlow }
<D>__{"whereas the chief executive officer has engaged in wasteful and negligent business practices to further his own personal environmental beliefs whereas these practices have affected the financial performance of the company by incurring significant losses whereas the shareholders have been materially harmed by these losses thereby, be it resolved that john parker hammond should be resolved from the office of chief executive officer, affective immediately." mr. chairman, i move the resolution be put to an immediate vote. do i have a second?}
<C>__{board member}
<D>__{i second the motion, mr. chairman, please poll the members by a show of hands.}
<A>__{the chairman signs heavily, feeling like a traitor. he can't bear to look at hammond on the tv monitor.}
<C>__{chairman}
<D>__{all those in favor of ingen corporate resolution 213c, please signify your approval by raising your right hand.}
<A>__{it starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes up. ludlow sits back, victorious. hammond, furious, raises his right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at the tv screen. it goes blank.}

<A>__{sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle of a welder's yard. scrap iron and steel lies everywhere. somewhere inside the shed, a phone rings. the whoosh of the arc welder shuts off. dieter stark, a big barrel chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soot and grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarette dangling from his lips.}

<A>__{smoke turns into steam as a subway thunder into a station underneath manhattan. the door whoosh open, spit out some commuters and suck up a few more. a tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving as fast as he can. the subway doors begin to close, but just before they meet the man jams a cane in between, stopping them. the man is ian malcolm, fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe. there's a hard wisdom in malcolm's eyes that may not have been there's a few years ago he know what you think, and he doesn't care.}
<L>__{interior subway car night}
<A>__{malcolm finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down. he looks awful. tired. weathered. he notices a curious man across from his is staring at his. malcolm looks away. the curious man still stares. nervy, the curious man gets up and approaches.}

<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(a withering look)}
<D>__{i was misquoted. i was merely speculating on the evolutionary scenario of a lost world. i never said i was in any such place.}
<A>__{he gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the curious man. as he sits down, he notices two other commuters across from him are staring at him. he looks at them. they looks away. he pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him. nowhere to hide.}

<A>__{malcolm stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated park avenue apartment.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{ian malcolm}
<A>__{a door opens and a little dog comes yapping out of the back. it bounds straight at malcolm, growling, jaws snapping. it lunges and malcolm bats it away with one swift swing of his cane. the dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, whining. the butler looks at malcolm disapprovingly.}
<C>__{butler}
<D>__{not an animal lover?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{not really.}
<L>__{interior hammond's bedroom night}
<A>__{malcolm enters a darkened bedroom. john hammond lies in the bed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room; medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among the furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{ian! don't linger in the doorway like an ingenue, come in, come in!}
<A>__{malcolm steps further into the room.}
<C>__{hammond }
<D>__{it's good to see you. it really is. how's the leg?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{resentful.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{when you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember. it's the people who challenged you. it is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning. i never told you how sorry i was about what happened after we returned.}
<A>__{noticing hammond's deteriorated condition, malcolm finds it hard to sustain anger.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i didn't know you weren't well.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{it's the lawyers. the lawyers are finally killing me.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{they do have motives. why did you want to see me? your message said it was urgent.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you were right and i was wrong. there! did you ever think you'd hear me say that? spectacularly wrong. instead of observing those animals, i tried to control them. i squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives. not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild. behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist. i could have had it, but i let it slip away.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{thank god for site b.}

<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(a spark in his eye)}
<D>__{well? didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{the hatchery, in particular? you know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth. genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory i showed you.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i don't believe you.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{isla nublar was just a showroom, ian, something for the tourists, site b was the factory floor. we built it first, on isla sorna, eight some miles from nublar.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{no, no, no, no, no, no . . .}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{after the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on site b. we had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. and they did. for four years i've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now i want you to go there and document them.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{are you out of your mind? i still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot you think i need more of that?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{it would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{so what?}
<A>__{hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near to him and open it on his lap. inside, there are memos, charts, maps and photographs.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i've been putting this together for over a year. i have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people. they won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them. just use my checkbook to get them there. i will fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately. if we hesitate, all will be lost.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{john . . .}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials. i believe you already know sarah harding. she's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter scavengers i bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this. if you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup. when she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.}
<A>__{malcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{your documentation, you should use forensic photographic methods, hasselbladt still cameras, high definition video. when the trick photography analysts take your evidence apart, make it impossible for them to say there was enhancement or computer graphic imaging. oh, this is very important avoid the island interior at all costs. stick to the outer rim. everything you need to know can be found there. vindication lies on the outer rim.}
<A>__{malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to hammond.}

<L>__{interior trailer day}
<A>__{inside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design. it's divided into sections, for different laboratory functions. the main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays, dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video monitors. next to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of processors, and a communications section. all the lab equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that slides into the walls. everything is bolted down. she notices a large map on the wall. off the coat of costa rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black ink. kelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the pacific ocean. thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in the highlighted region, there is a semi circle of five. matanceros. muerte. tacano. pena. and sorna. underneath the whole island chain, there is a bold legend. "the five deaths," it says. slowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters of those three ominous words.}
