<L>__{interior cell, camelot evening}
<A>__{eyes closed, lancelot lies on a bed, naked but for a cloth across his loins. his minor wounds have been dressed, and merlin is kneading the huge gash in his stomach, working the severed flesh together. guenevere stands on one side of the bed, arthur on the other, both looking down upon lancelot, relieved and not daring to look at each other.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{flesh on flesh. you must press on the wound, guenevere, hold it, and it will begin to bind.}
<A>__{guenevere kneels, and at her touch lancelot's eyes flicker open. merlin exits, and draws arthur away with him. arthur is deeply tormented.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{merlin, tell me. now that guenevere is returned to me...}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{what is it my child?}
<A>__{merlin appears moved by the predicaments that arthur has to face.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{will i have a son?}
<A>__{merlin stares off into the evening sky, where a lark sings high up.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{just yes? no mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? that frightens me.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{a king should be afraid, always. the enemy is everywhere. waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here.}
<A>__{he taps his skull and smiles.}
