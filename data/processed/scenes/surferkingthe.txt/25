<D>__{when she said, when are you going to tell him?}

<D>__{i will tell you over a hamburger at big mike's.}
<A>__{robbie and alex proceed to big mike's out of frame. suddenly in the background we see a tube splashdown from a slide and the 7 year old girl riding in it falls out. realizing she is no longer safely in a tube she screams and begins splashing as if drowning. a guard nearby blows a single tweet of her whistle. in slow motion we see four other guards throughout the area turn and react to the whistle. they begin running, baywatch style towards the scene. two guards are running and carrying a backboard. they converge in another baywatch style slow mo shot and line up along the edge of the splashdown pool. one guard in the middle has a rescue tube, and, still in slow motion, squats down slowly as if to jump in and rescue the girl. at the low end of the jump crouch, however he stops. we see his face in close up as he says.}
