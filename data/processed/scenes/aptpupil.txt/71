<A>__{todd races up to the door. he tries the handle and then pounds on the door with his fist. the following conversation cuts back between todd and dussander on opposite sides of the door.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{open the fucking door! right now. right now!}
<A>__{dussander shoves his chair under the doorknob. he drags the table against the door as he speaks. todd is screaming on the other side and begins to kick at the door violently.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you give me no choice, boy.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what are you doing? open the door.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{if you won't help me, then i will make you help me. if you don't, we are finished.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{fuck you, old man. this is your problem. i didn't do this. open the door!}
<A>__{todd pounds awayat the door. tears now stream down his cheeks. his relentless pounding has dussander enraged. dussander pounds back at the door to shut todd up. it works.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{enough. enough. enough! if you don't stop screaming like a fucking school girl i'm going to...}
<A>__{a surge of pain from his chest silences him. he recovers, speaking slowly and deliberately.}

<C>__{todd}
<D>__{fuck your document. i got nothing to do with this. don't make it sound like i do. i came here, i saw this shit, and now i'm getting the fuck out of here. that's what i'm gonna tell the police.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{why not tell them the truth? tell them i locked you in the cellar. tell them i wouldn't let you out until you buried the body.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i'm not listening to this.}
