<ACTION>__{CAMERA PANS a group of freshly-scrubbed, innocent children, obediently standing in line, like recruits for the Holy Crusade. PULL BACK to REVEAL they are wearing the gray blazers, striped ties and navy slacks of St. Luke's School. They are waiting patiently at the curbside in front of the statue of the school's sainted namesake. One of the fifth grade BOYS pokes the KID next to him with his elbow. The other Kid is about to retaliate when SISTER MARY FRANCIS, a stern-faced nun, appears behind them, grabbing them both firmly by the shoulders.}

<DIAL>__{Make one more move and you'll both be staying late for the rest of the week.}

<DIAL>__{Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.}
<ACTION>__{Sister Mary Francis checks her watch. She scowls and looks out past the parking lot gate. Suddenly we HEAR the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring at full throttle. There is a SCREECHING of BRAKES, followed by the loud GRINDING of GEARS. It sounds like the Indy 500 is taking place around the corner.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(used to this)}
<DIAL>__{Step away from the curb, children.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANOTHER ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{Zooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school bus. It practically takes the last turn on just two wheels. The bus driver quickly slams on the brakes, leaving ten feet of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear-splitting halt right in front of them. The front door immediately swings open and RICK STAHL, the driver, hops out. Rick is the life of the party, even when there isn't any party going on. While chronologically older than the St. Luke students, the only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a driver's license. Rick figures he'll live up to his capabilities and get serious in his next life... This incarnation's strictly for laughs. Sister Mary Francis steps up to him.}

The formally well-mannered children are acting like normal kids... hitting each other over the heads with books, running up and down the aisles, screaming at the top of their lungs.

<ACTION>__{O'NEILL We see he has his camera and backdrop set up in the camera department behind a velour curtain which blacks out the rest of the store. He's conservatively dressed in a suit, vest and tie. He looks like he could be a Young Republican. But under those Sears clothes is a man a little off center. Rick's best friend. Need we say more? He takes the film out of the camera. The matronly mother is in the process of gathering up her baby.}

<ACTION>__{Manuel waves at Chulo, who turns, hops on the bus. Rick starts it up and starts to drive away. Just as the bus CLEARS FRAME, we SEE Manuel connect two wires together at the same moment the guy with the hose washes down the area around his feet. Manuel lights up like a Christmas tree, screaming in pain. There is a beat, and then Robert falls INTO FRAME, still holding the cigarette lighter, and the car Raul is driving enters the lot and smashes into the side of the garage.}
<LOC>__{INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A sign on an office door says "CONCERT TICKET AGENCY." From inside we HEAR someone TALKING loudly on the phone. Chulo, Rick and O'Neill open the door and go inside. On the walls in the cramped office there are rock 'n' roll concert posters advertising rock bands like Men At Work, The Clash and Barry Manilow. Behind a cluttered desk we FIND a little man with a thin mustache and horn-rimmed glasses. This is GARY MELNITZ, wheeler-dealer, entrepreneur and coward. Gary yells a lot, which is a definite overcompensation for his size and inability to deal with the opposite sex.}

The cashier, PHOEBE, has devoted her life to following the current trends and fads no matter how inane they may be.

She seems to be the only sane employee in the place because she's actually working, putting clothes on the racks.

The front door opens and BOBBIE, a very sultry and earthy- looking girl with long, dark hair, pushes inside. She is O'Neill's girl and Debbie's best friend...
