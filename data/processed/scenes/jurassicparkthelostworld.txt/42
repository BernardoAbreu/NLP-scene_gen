<L>__{exterior jungle}
<A>__{the jungle foliage shivers, quakes, and finally falls as the hunters' convoy roars into the hart of the jungle. dieter stark stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the "speedbird," waving the convoy forward, his driver (carter) at the wheel beside him. ludlow is in the back seat of the speedbird next to dr. burke. roland and ajay, his tracker, are in the second jeep. they look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car stops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well. in the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something in front of it. dieter climbs out, plainly irritated. he walks around the front of the car and sees four pachycephalosaurs eating grass in the middle of the jungle trail. they're about five feet tall, thick, heavy set animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing, a tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of their heads. dieter doesn't seem impressed. he looks back at ludlow, who look at dr. burke. burke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{pachycephalosaurus!}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{carnivore?}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(enchanted)}
<D>__{huh? no! no, herbivore, late cretaceous. very unusual plant eater, see that distinctive domed skull? that's nine inches of solid bone.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<P>__{(who cares?)}
<D>__{just get them out of the way, dieter.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{come on, move it!!}
<A>__{the pachys look up at him sluggishly, still eating, like cows chewing their cuds. as unimpressive with him as he is with them, they go back to their grass.}
<C>__{dieter }
<D>__{oh, for god's }
<A>__{he slings his rifle off his shoulder and aims it at the closest animal. behind him, roland has climbed out of the second jeep.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{dieter. this is a round up, not a war. use your powers of persuasion.}
<A>__{dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead, which it does, slowly, toward the animals. the pachys look up, alert, but do not move. dieter walks toward them.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{come on, come on, don't have all day!}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(going on to no one in particular)}
<D>__{see, the pachy's neck attaches at the bottom of its skull instead of the back of its head, as with reptiles.}
<A>__{the speedbird draws closer. the first pachy stares at it intently. the lead vehicle gets closer, closer and bangs into the pachy, knocking it back a few feet, out of the way.}
<C>__{burke }
<D>__{so when it lowers its head, its neck lines up directly with its backbone }
<A>__{behind dieter, ajay is staring at something on the ground at his feet. he takes a few steps further into the foliage, then turns back toward roland.}
<C>__{ajay}
<D>__{roland.}
<A>__{up at the front, the pachys turn and hop away. dieter turns and heads back to the speedbird. as he reaches for the door, a voice calls "look out!" from behind him. dieter spins around, just in time to see the first pachy in full charge. it slams headfirst into the speedbird, smashing the headlights and denting the grill.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(concluding his lecture)}
<D>__{which is perfect for absorbing impact.}
<A>__{dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car. the pachy has backed up for another run and is now charging right}
<B>__{at him.}
<A>__{dieter retreats, quickly, and rips open the passenger door to protect himself. slam! the pachy clobbers the door, sending dieter flying against the car, knocking the wind out of him. in the other jeeps, the rest of the hunters stand up or lean out the window for a better look, laughing. pow!! the pachy head butts the tire next to dieter. it bounces off, tumbles to the ground, and rolls to its feet as dieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the speedbird. but the pachy is quicker and lunges at dieter again. he's forced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the speedbird, just as the animal slams into the rear of the vehicle. now the other three animals join the jun. ludlow and the driver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the car again and again, smashing the steel meshed windows and mangling the quarter panels. the rest of the group watches, vastly amused. a few steps into the jungle, ajay and roland are staring at something on the ground an animal footprint, three toed, enormous.}
<C>__{ajay}
<D>__{it matches the pictures.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{it certainly does.}
<A>__{roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle, ignoring the pachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird. roland opens a case in the back of the jeep, revealing his gun. it's an antique elephant gun, a double barreled .600 nitro express. nearly a hundred years old, it's still in immaculate condition, its rosewood stock buttery smooth, bisons delicately engraved along its silver breach. the barrels are twenty four inches long, topped with an ivory bead foresight at the business end. roland scoops up the gun, breaks the breach, and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his shirt pocket. four inches long and three quarters of an inch in diameter, these are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made. he slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush. roland pauses before he goes, as if noticing the animals trashing the speedbird for the first time.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{the pachys all freeze, staring at him. roland waves one hand, hisses sharply between his teeth and the pachys scatter, back into the jungle. takes care of that problem. roland turns and heads back into the jungle, calling out over his shoulder to ludlow.}
<C>__{roland }
<D>__{don't worry about us. we'll catch up.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{where do you think you're going?!}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{to collect my fee.}
<A>__{and with that he disappears into the foliage. the driver of the speedbird drops it into gear and the battered car groans forward. as it moves ahead, it reveals dieter, lying underneath it, ego bruised worse than body. in the jungle, ajay takes a step into the bush, but at a ninety degree angle away from the direction in which the animals tracks lead.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{ajay.}
<A>__{ajay turns. roland points in the direction in which the footprints lead.}
<C>__{roland }
<D>__{i'm no tracker, but even i can read this spoor.}
<C>__{ajay}
<D>__{do you wish to go where the animal has been, or where the animal is?}
<A>__{roland smiles. ajay sets off in his direction and roland follows.}
