<D>__{alright then, out of all of charlie's chicks who do you think is the hottest?}
<L>__{interior car front seat night}
<A>__{fast food wrappers and road maps clutter the car's dashboard, a swinging monkey head dangles from the rear view mirror. behind the wheel, the driver, bill hudley, 29, downs the last sip of coffee before crumpling the paper cup and placing it among the other trash before him.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i guess if i had to choose i'd say... mmmmmm... sandra good. she seemed like a nice girl, i mean in a psycho kind of way.}
<A>__{beside him rides, jerry gilmore, 30, slumped down in his seat, reading a magazine with a flashlight, feet hanging out the window.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{really? huh, i thought for sure you'd say lynette fromme. she's got that snooty vibe i know you dig.}
<C>__{bill}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i will let it slide, she was only seventeen.}
