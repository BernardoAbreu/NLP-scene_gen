<L>__{exterior school street minutes later}
<A>__{dewey's patrol jeep is parked in front of the school. he stands in the open driver's door talking on the radio.}
<C>__{sheriff burke}
<P>__{(from radio)}
<D>__{she's okay. looks like some boys were teasing her. himbry's shutting down the school though. i want you to take look around.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{yes, sir, sheriff.}
<A>__{dewey shuts the jeep door and heads for campus when gale weathers appears, her fake face aglow.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{hi! gale weathers. field correspondent, inside story.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i know who you are, ma'am. how's the eye?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{productive. so they're closing down the school?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{well..uh...yes ma'am. for the time being.}
<A>__{dewey heads for the school building. gale scurries along side him flirtatiously.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{and why is that? has something happened?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{you're not supposed to be here, ma'am.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i know, i should be in new york covering the sharon stone stalker but who knew? please, call me gale. you look awfully young to be a police officer.}
<A>__{dewey's eyes wander down to gale's long legs, the way her hips move as she walks...he's clearly distracted.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i'm twenty five years old, ma'am.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{twenty five, huh? in a demographic study i proved to be most popular amongst males, 11 24. i just missed you. of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. does the force require that you work out?}
<A>__{dewey looks away, blushing a bit.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{no, ma'am. because of my boyish good looks, muscle mass has increased my acceptance as a serious police officer.}
<A>__{they approach the school's front entrance. suddenly, mr. himbry's voice in amplified through intercoms across campus via the pa system. they stop to listen.}
<C>__{mr. himbry}
<P>__{(via pa)}
<D>__{"your attention please. due to the recent events that have occurred and until it comes to a resolve effective immediately all classes are suspended til further notice. the bayboro police dept. has also asked me to announce a city wide curfew beginning at 6 o'clock pm. i repeat..."}
<A>__{gale speaks over mr. himbry's voice.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. the killer has yet to strike twice.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{well, we can hope, can't we? we certainly don't have any leads. a ghost mask, a cellular phone not much there.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{we're tracking the cellular phone bill.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{really? you small town guys are good. and have you located sidney's father?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{no, not yet.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{he's not a suspect, is he?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{we haven't ruled out that possibil...}
<A>__{dewey, realizing he's said too much, clams up.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{if you'll excuse me, ma'am.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{am i keeping you? i'm sorry.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{that's quite alright. if i may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.}
<A>__{dewey starts up the school's front steps as the bell rings.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{so you do watch the show?}
<A>__{he turns to her earnestly as students come pouring out the front doors.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i just turned 25. i was 24 for a whole year.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{you are precious. please, call me gale.}
<A>__{she smiles deliciously, gives him a wink, then struts off as dewey, like a nervous little school boy watches her go.}
