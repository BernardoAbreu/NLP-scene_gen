<L>__{interior olympic auditorium fight night}
<A>__{the battered face of an irish pug. same guy? no. a hard jab bashes the pug out of frame. and there i am: next to the `ring' magazine reporter chewing the ass out of his cigar.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{lieutenant dave klein, vice division. lapd. that's what my face looked like before.}
<A>__{my point of view now: irish pug on the business end of this bantam black's combos. standing to my left: sergeant richard "junior" stemmons. twenty six.}
<D>__{me (v.o.) (cont'd) junior stemmons. a partner i never asked for. the scowl meant to hide a shit scared kid who'd been teaching evidence classes three months ago. his old man was an lapd lifer who never got past sergeant.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{we should make our move now.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{mid fight? look at the crowd: you wanna be at the center of a riot?}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{i don't wanna be here when noonan and the feds show up.}
<A>__{i point at the bantam black:}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{we let sanderline finish this beating, we get his gratitude.}
<A>__{junior eyes the exits clockwise, nervous, waiting for `untouchables' to break the doors down. i hate the way panic smells when i stand this close to it.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{we gonna let rock a bye fight too }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ relax junior.}
