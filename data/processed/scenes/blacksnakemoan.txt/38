<A>__{lazarus's blues is all we hear as four guys chase rae through the woods. she is in her shirt and panties, wearing football shoulder pads. she is completely wasted. lost. the ground rocks back and forth with each step. trees pass in a slow motion haze.}

<D>__{well i sure did shot my baby, but i did it because she did me wrong. well i sure did shot my baby, but i did it because she did me wrong. you know the judge called it murder now the penitentiary is my home.}
<A>__{rae grips a tree to steady herself, but a team member tackles her. the woods spin and distort as someone mounts her with ease.}

<D>__{i loved that woman, she said she didn't love no one but me. i loved that woman, she said she didn't love no one but me.}
<A>__{rae smiles as she lifts her hand up to the stars, passing the writhing back of the guy on top of her. if she could just grab a star she would feel safe again. she tries to snatch one. she can't. her hand drops as the boy stands and takes off after his friends tossing the football. rae lies motionless on the ground.}
