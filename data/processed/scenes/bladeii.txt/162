<L>__{interior caliban industries lobby night}
<A>__{a set of elevator doors open, disgorging damaskinos. beyond the lobby windows we can see a waiting helicopter, vampire soldiers readying it for take off. damaskinos rushes across the lobby and is almost at the exit when chunk!chunk!chunk! a series of steel shutters slam down over the doors and windows. damaskinos tries to tug one of the shutters upwards, then moves to a keypad nearby. he starts hurriedly tapping in a numeric sequence when we hear:}
<C>__{nyssa }
<D>__{i overrode the security codes.}
<A>__{damaskinos spins around. nyssa stands behind him. she's got whistler's rail gun in her hands.}
<C>__{nyssa }
<D>__{we're locked in.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<D>__{are you insane? he'll kill us both!}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{maybe it's better that way.}
<A>__{as if in response, a grinding shudder comes from the elevator doors. damaskinos spins in wide eyed horror, then }
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{what's it going to be, damaskinos? thiavolos. the devil you know }
<B>__{blade}
<A>__{enters the lobby from a mezzanine above, sword in hand.}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{ or the devil you don't?}
<A>__{damaskinos turns back to his daughter, making a last appeal.}
<C>__{damaskinos}
<P>__{(vampire dialect; subtitled)}
<D>__{for god's sake, nyssa! let us out of here!}
<A>__{wham!wham!wham! nomak pounds away. the elevator doors are starting to buckle, then they tear apart completely }
<B>__{nomak}
<A>__{bursts into the lobby, roaring. if anything, he is even more animalistic now, his features having become grossly distorted.}
<C>__{nomak}
<P>__{(in vampire dialect)}
<D>__{why are you frightened, father? the prodigal son has returned.}
<A>__{damaskinos scurries backwards, but there's nowhere left to run. nomak descends on him, lifting the vampire into a rib crushing embrace, chomping his elongated canines into damaskinos' throat. damaskinos squeals like a child as his life blood is sucked out of him. his body begins to cave inward, shrinking and twisting until there's nothing left but shriveled husk. nyssa hefts the rail gun and fires at nomak's back. nomak howls, releasing damaskinos' body, then turns, focusing his blood drunk gaze on nomak.}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{get out of here!}
<A>__{but nyssa stands her ground, rachetting back the slide on the rail gun, readying to unleash another barrage of needles. nomak charges, moving at unbelievable speed. she fires again, aiming at nomak's chest but then nomak is upon her. he slaps the rail gun from her hands, smashing it to pieces. then he wraps his hand around her throat, pulling her forward, sinking his teeth into her neck. nyssa screams.}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{nyssa!!!}
<B>__{on blade}
<A>__{as he leaps from the mezzanine level, sword extended, like beowulf diving to slay grendel. he plunges the sword deep into nomak's upper torso. then drives it in even further nomak releases nyssa and back hands blade across the face, sending him sailing through the air. he lands, skids across the floor }
<B>__{on nomak}
<A>__{stumbling backwards into the wall. the sword has sunk so deep that the tip is actually protruding out his back, scraping a gash across the wall as nomak slides towards the floor. nomak grunts, then reaches for the pomeel with his ruined hand. he grips the pommel and snaps the sword blade in half. then he slams against the wall, forcing the half of the broken blade that's still embedded in him out back through the front of his chest. as nomak rises to his feet blade is on him again, snap kicking the reaper in the chest. nomak retaliates. blade somersaults out of the way, then springs back again, kicking nomak in the face, breaking nomak's neck. nomak's head lolls unnaturally sideways for a heartbeat and then nomak swings his head around, somehow righting his neck vertebrae with a snap of his head. they trade blows, a brutal death match that seems to defy gravity. blade moves in for a round house punch, but nomak catches his fist, holding it for a split second, then bending blade's hand at an unnatural angle, snapping his wrist bones. the pain is enormous. nomak starts beating the living shit out of blade, pummeling him with his fists, gripped by an uncontrollable rage. he smashes blade against a marble column, cracking it. then he flings blade against one of the brushed steel walls so hard that blade's body actually leaves an indentation. before blade can recover, nomak is in front of him, launching another kick. blade rolls his head out of the way, barely avoiding nomak's boot heel which dents the wall. nomak kicks a second time. blade avoids nomak, but third time's the charm and nomak lands one squarely in blade's gut. blade falls beneath a flurry of blows, unable to defend himself any longer. blood stains his eyes, obscuring his vision. he strikes out blindly, but nomak has forced him to the ground, pinning him there. as blade struggles to free himself }
<B>__{nomak}
<A>__{lowers his head towards blade's face. the scar seam in nomak's chin splits open and nomak's lower jaw flares apart, distending and widening to reveal the awful, glistening hell maw the hollow inner fangs and striated cartilage which are closing about blade's face. blade twists his head violently to the right, then glimpses the broken tip of his sword resting a few feet away. he reaches for it in desperation, plunging it up into nomak's chest. nomak howls. because the hilt has been broken off, blade is forced to grip the cutting edge of the weapon with his bare hands. it slices into his fingers but blade just grips the broken sword tighter, ignoring the pain, driving it deeper and deeper until, suddenly, it penetrates the cartilaginous shell around nomak's heart and }

<D>__{blood brother.}
<A>__{nomak smiles, covering blade's hands with his own. he looks blade in the eye, then drives the broken sword home. nomak's body stiffens, his eyes grow unseeing, an oddly serene look spreading across his tortured face. a patch of blackness begins radiating outward from his chest, moving over his body, carbonizing him from within. as his blackened flesh begins to crack, blue flames flicker out from the fissures. in seconds, nomak is gone. beat. blade stands, exhausted. then he looks to where nyssa rests. he moves to her side, kneeling beside her. she smiles up at him, bravely, but frightened all the same. blade inspects the wound on her neck. it's clearly fatal.}

<P>__{(with genuine sadness)}
<D>__{not good.}
