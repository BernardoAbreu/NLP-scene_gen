<L>__{exterior ballpark day}
<A>__{the roar of the crowd at the lobos game. colin walks with abby, who adjusts something in her ear. now she's wearing the earpiece from the station, and on the other end... mike's pov through binoculars a different angle of abby walking down the aisle.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{nod if you can hear me.}
<A>__{binoculars pov abby nods.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{just relax. you're gonna be fine. i will walk you through this.}
<A>__{colin looks at abby and smiles as they take their seats, popcorn in hand.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{do you follow baseball?}
<A>__{we intercut : with mike.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{there's no right answer to that question. do something non committal...}
<A>__{abby does something between a nod and shaking her head. colin hooks at her, confused.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{i'm really more of a fair weather fan myself. i do like watching mike deloggia pitch, though. amazing bone structure.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{laugh.}
<A>__{abby is baffled but proceeds to laugh awkwardly. colin looks at her.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{what's so funny?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{your joke.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{what joke?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{shit, he was serious?}
<A>__{feeling a popcorn kernel in her teeth, abby takes out her floss.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{wait what the fuck are you doing? is that floss?}
<A>__{abby freezes.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{jesus! put that away!}
<A>__{she puts the floss back in her purse.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{good. now toss your hair.}
<A>__{she dramatically tosses her hair from one side to the other.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{okay, that was a little over the top, but nice try.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{for what?}
<A>__{abby realizes she's spoken aloud.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{thank you for... just being you.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{you're welcome...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{okay, no more improvising. just repeat everything i say, "you're so much fun to be with."}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you're so much fun to be with.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{a fan calls to mike.}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{hey, down in front!}
<A>__{mike gestures for the fan to leave him alone as he continues to instruct abby.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(to abby)}
<D>__{you're not like the other guys i`ve dated.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you're not like the other guys i've dated.}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{hey, sit down, jackass.}
<A>__{mike waves him off, trying to remain focused on abby.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(to abby)}
<D>__{you're so much more interesting and informed.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you're so much more interesting and informed.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{that's nice to hear.}
<A>__{the fan throws peanuts at mike. mike turns around and shouts at the fan.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{dude, what the fuck?!}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{dude, what the fuck?!}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{abby blanches, waiting for mike instructions.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<A>__{colin is now just staring at her.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(to abby)}
<D>__{no, i'm not talking to you.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i'm not talking to you.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{did i do something wrong?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{abby, listen tell him you saw him looking at another girl. it's the only way out of this.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(to colin)}
<D>__{were you looking at another girl?}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{uh her?}
<A>__{she points to the only nearby female an elderly obese hot dog lady.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{yeah. i was just trying to get us a hot dog.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{there's an awkward moment as colin hands her the hot dog.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{alright, we need a recovery. make sure to eat your hot dog slowly. men like watching penis shaped food go into a girl's mouth.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{repulsed, she flinches, losing control of her drink, dumping it into colin's lap. he flinches.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{oh my god, i'm so sorry.}
<A>__{she grabs a napkin and starts rubbing his khakis.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{it's fine, really...}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{no, i have to get it out or else it will stain }
<A>__{she puts some muscle into it.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{what fabric is this...}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{cotton.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{cotton's the worst. well actually leather's the worst, followed by suede...}
<A>__{unbeknownst to them, the batter hits a pop fly near them. the jumbotron camera follows the guy catching the fly, then finds abby and colin. pans over to them and it looks like abby is giving colin an enthusiastic hand job. the entire stadium, ballplayers included, stop what they're doing and stare.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{are you sure they're cotton cause this should be coming out, wait... it's coming. it's definitely coming. it's...done!}
<A>__{she smiles at colin. as he looks nervously up at the}
<B>__{jumbotron.}
<A>__{abby follows his gaze and sees she's on it. everyone at the stadium is looking at her. the organ player bangs out "charge." the stadium starts whooping and hollering.}
