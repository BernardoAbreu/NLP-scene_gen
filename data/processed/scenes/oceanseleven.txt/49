<A>__{a tournament level pool table holds center stage here. atop its green felt sits a raised, elaborate miniature of terry benedict's las vegas: three casinos and hotels with the strip running between them. as the eleven surround the table and the model...}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{gentlemen: the 14000 block of las vegas boulevard. otherwise known as the bellagio, the mirage, the m.g.m. grand. together, they're the three most profitable casinos in las vegas...}
<A>__{is a complex substructure, featuring three tunnels, each leading from a casino to a single freight sized elevator shaft which descends into an enormous vault.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{gentlemen: the bellagio vault. located below the strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth. it safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and we're going to rob it.}
<A>__{everyone takes a breath, awed.}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{smash and grab job, huh?}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{it's a little more complicated than that.}
<A>__{danny picks up a remote control and flips on a panel of tvs.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{courtesy of frank catton, new blackjack dealer at the bellagio, security tapes from the three casinos.}
<A>__{on the monitors: three montages of black and white security tapes, starting within the three casinos' cages, moving into the tunnels, then (as the tvs unite in their images) pushing into the elevator and eventually the vault. as the group's glances shoot back and forth from the tv to the corresponding section of the model, i.e. from a pov of the tunnel to the miniature tunnel itself...}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{okay. bad news first. this place houses a security system which rivals most nuclear missile silos. first: we have to get within the casino cages }
<C>__{rusty}
<P>__{(indicating)}
<D>__{ here, here, and here }
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{ which anyone knows takes more than a smile. next: through these doors, each of which requires a different six digit code changed every twelve hours. past those lies the elevator, and this is where it gets tricky: the elevator won't move without authorized fingerprint identifications }
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{ which we can't fake }
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{ and vocal confirmations from both the security center within the bellagio and the vault below }
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{ which we won't get.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors }
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{ meaning if we manually override the lift, the shaft's exit will lock down automatically and we'll be trapped.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{once we've gotten down the shaft, though, then it's a walk in the park: just three more guards with uzis and predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man. any questions?}
<A>__{silence. for a moment, each man keeps his two dozen questions or more to himself. at last, one speaks up... the amazing yen. in cantonese. of course, no one understands him. except rusty.}
<C>__{rusty}
<P>__{(in response)}
<D>__{no. tunneling is out. there are richter scales monitoring the ground for one hundred yards in every direction. if a groundhog tried to nest there, they'd know about it. anyone else?}
<A>__{another silence. either the guys are too dumbfounded by that bilingual exchange or too numbed by the task ahead of them to speak.}
<C>__{turk}
<D>__{you said something about good news...}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(smiles, happy someone asked)}
<D>__{the nevada gaming commission stipulates: a casino must hold in reserve enough cash to cover every chip at play on its floor. as i mentioned, this vault services each of the three casinos above it. that means: during the week, by law, it must hold anywhere from sixty to seventy million dollars in cash and coin. on a weekend, between eighty and ninety million. on a fight night, like the one two weeks from tonight, the night we're going to rob it, at least a hundred and fifty million. without breaking a sweat.}
<P>__{(gazing about room)}
<D>__{now there are eleven of us. each with an equal share. you do the math.}
<A>__{moving around the table on ten faces, as everyone does precisely that, in their heads, except for virgil who does it on his fingers. he whistles.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{that's what i said.}
<A>__{everyone seems suitably impressed by their share.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{i have a question.}
<P>__{(as danny turns to him)}
<D>__{say we do get into the cage, and through the security doors there, and down the elevator we can't move, and past the guards with guns, and into the vault we can't open...}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{without being seen by the cameras.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(off everyone's astonishment)}
<D>__{oh, right. sorry. i forgot to mention that.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{say we do all that. we're just supposed to walk outta there with a hundred million dollars in cash on us without getting stopped?}
<A>__{danny smiles, his broad, sure of himself grin, the one rusty couldn't deny earlier and these guys won't deny now.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{saul looks panic stricken; like that, his ulcer has flared up, and he pops a rolaid in his mouth.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{alright. here's how we'll begin.}
