<A>__{a dead chicken adorns lucinnius's table. he and his wife, dalmia, and their son are lying on their couches picking at the food with their fingers. lucinnius is drinking more wine than usual. hector and the other household slaves are in attendance. thalia is also there, serving her mistress. dalmia knows something is up, but she doesn't know what. she attempts to break the silence. she calls on the cook from the kitchen.}

<A>__{the kitchen slave quickly appears.}
<C>__{dalmia}
<D>__{solus... i'm eating chicken again. i ate chicken yesterday and the day before... will i be eating chicken again tomorrow? why am i always eating chicken?}
<A>__{solus looks up at lucinnius and hector, but they offer him no help.}
<C>__{solus}
<D>__{it's what we have to hand in the kitchen, ma'am... i always try to use the fresh stuff... the chickens have just been turning up...}
<A>__{he looks again at lucinnius and hector. they look at each other. thalia looks at hector. dalmia looks at them all looking at each other, more intrigued than she was before. a slave interrupts them.}
<C>__{slave}
<D>__{two men have come to see you. from cyprian.}
<A>__{lucinnius and hector look at each other and share a moment of hope. they might be coming with good news, perhaps a softening of cyprian's heart.}
