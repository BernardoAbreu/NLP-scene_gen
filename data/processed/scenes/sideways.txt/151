<B>__{stephanie}
<A>__{seated halfway up on the motel stairs, her helmet in her lap, watching patiently as }
<B>__{the saab}
<A>__{pulls to a stop in a parking space. miles masks his concern as he gets out of the car and reaches in the backseat for his sears bag.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{hey, baby.}
<A>__{stephanie stands up and slowly descends the steps, as jack reaches into the trunk and pulls out a big cuddly lion doll.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look what i got for our favorite girl.}
<A>__{stephanie walks toward jack as he waddles toward her hugging the lion. when they get close, stephanie's face transforms with rage.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{you motherfucker!}
<A>__{she swings her helmet and hits jack full in the face. jack falls, blood spraying out of his nose. stephanie stands over him and continues to beat him with her helmet as he rolls back and forth, protecting his head with the stuffed lion. miles ineffectually attempts to stop her, dancing just out of range.}

<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{fuckface!}
<P>__{(to miles)}
<D>__{you too!}
<A>__{as she speeds away, miles is left to comfort his wounded friend. the lion lies nearby, staring blankly at the sky.}
