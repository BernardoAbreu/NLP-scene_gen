<L>__{exterior main street day}
<A>__{there she is, alone in the vacant street, walkman blaring in her ears, merrily bouncing along to a rock 'n' roll beat. angle pham van's store thoughts of personal safety vanish as the horrified people lean way out the doors and windows and shout with one voice:}
<C>__{crowd}
<P>__{(ad lib)}
<D>__{mindy! get off your pogo stick! get in here, girl! run, mindy!}
<A>__{angle mindy she can't hear them over her walkman. a tell tale puff of dust spurts up not fifty feet from her! angle pham van's store val sees mindy has only seconds left! he vaults straight out the window and charges toward her! right behind him comes earl and rhonda. angle nancy as she rounds a corner at the opposite end of town. she spots mindy, then sees val running. she starts running.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{mindy! mindy!}
<A>__{angle mindy she's lazily bouncing in circles squeak, squeak, squeak. she goes wide eyed as she rotates to see val coming at her like a mad bull, arms outstretched. the asphalt under her pogo stick cracks and val tackles her, both of them tumbling head over heels. she scrambles up, rubbing her skinned elbow and yelling:}
<C>__{mindy}
<D>__{oww! val, you hurt me...!}
<A>__{val claps his hand over her mouth. she goes wide eyed as she sees: her pogo stick standing straight up in the cracked asphalt! then it is sucked down like so much spaghetti! nancy rushes into frame, hugging mindy. val signals her to be quiet. they sit uneasily. where's the creature? suddenly the pogo stick erupts out of the earth right in their midst! val runs one way, nancy and mindy the other, heading up the street toward their house. val scrambles up onto his pick up truck! the creature rams the truck, rupturing a tire. as it shakes the truck violently, val spots rhonda and earl, now standing uncertainly halfway between him and pham van's.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{go back, for chrissake!}
<A>__{rhonda and earl hesitate.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{we gotta get him off there. it'll suck that truck down!}
<A>__{but earl now hears something behind them! down the street, a little wall of cinder blocks framing viola's driveway suddenly topples over.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{oh, jesus. rhonda, another one!}
<A>__{angle low camera rhonda and earl camera charges toward them. earl swerves toward pham van's, but rhonda is cut off! she heads toward the next nearest haven:}
