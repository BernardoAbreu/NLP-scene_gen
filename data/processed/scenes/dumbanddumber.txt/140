<A>__{harry is walking down the highway, his thumb stuck out unenthusiastically. a few cars whiz by, the cold wind whipping at his clothes. a station wagon blows by and throws a bag of garbage out the window. it lands at harry's feet. extreme close up of harry's face a tear slowly rolls down his cheek (like the indian in the commercial). pan down to the bag of garbage. we see it's a bag of onions that's ripped open. suddenly a hearse pulls up and stops. it's an ominous looking vehicle and harry hesitates. then the passenger window rolls down, revealing a contrite lloyd at the wheel.}
