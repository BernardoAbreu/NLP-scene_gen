<L>__{82. the great cabin dawn}
<A>__{wan dawn light reflects off the ceiling onto the bloody, bandaged officers, conducting an angry post mortem as killick serves coffee.}
<C>__{allen}
<D>__{...call her a frigate? ha! you ask me she's no more a frigate than a painted dutchman. more like a ship of the line, a two decker more'n a frigate.}
<A>__{mowett is trying to staunch a persistent nosebleed.}
<C>__{mowett}
<D>__{one does wonder what manner of hull she has. our balls seemed to bounce right off her.}
<A>__{jack enters, his head newly bandaged. he walks past the seated officers and stands looking out through the stern windows. the officers continue their conversation, though their words are intended for jack}
<C>__{pullings}
<D>__{she had the weather gauge and long eighteens which could hit us beyond our effective range. that's the sum of it}
<C>__{allen}
<D>__{and 40 guns to our 28, i counted the muzzle flashes.}
<C>__{pullings}
<D>__{it was an unfair match, no dishonor in defeat no dishonor at all.}
<A>__{jack still has his back to them. he puts his hand in his pocket and finds something there the shattered fragments of his gold pocket watch.}
<C>__{allen}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{well, we can patch up our main and mizzen the foresail is too far gone so we'll bend our spare.}
<C>__{pullings}
<D>__{sir.}
<A>__{jack finally turns.}
<C>__{pullings }
<D>__{mr. allen is confident, with basic repairs, we can get home as we are... allowing for a stop in jamaica.}
<C>__{allen}
<D>__{at port royal we can haul her into dry dock, and hopefully get her home without...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we're not going home.}
<A>__{an expectant hush. killick is all ears, as he picks up the coffee cups and places them carefully on a silver tray.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{what is our purpose here gentlemen? why were we sent? to punish a blackguard privateer who has decimated our atlantic whaling fleet and now threatens to do the same in the pacific. are we to leave those ships to his mercy and slink back into portsmouth another defeat to add to the list. is that what we draw our wages for? i say we pursue her and pay her back with interest}
<C>__{allen}
<D>__{with respect, captain, she could be half way to cape horn by the time we're repaired and underway.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(sternly)}
<D>__{then there's not a moment to lose.}
