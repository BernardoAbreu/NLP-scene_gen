<A>__{the rental car, smoke pouring from the engine, clunks to a dead roll, stops. bitsey jumps out, vhs cassette in hand. she doesn't close the door. starts running. bitsey runs down the middle of the two lane highway. the rental car in the b.g. recedes into the mist visibility is no more than fifty yards. the sounds of her breathing and shoes hitting the pavement echo into the mist. she runs, and runs. a car comes up quickly behind her. its horn blares. she turns, starts to wave it down. the driver sits on his horn, swerves around her onto highway's shoulder and drives on. she runs. runs past an abandoned vegetable stand. runs past a sleepy farmhouse. she runs, and runs. she slows, out of strength, looks up and down the highway. both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a tunnel of fog. she stumbles on, a final effort. she runs. sees something. stops cold. coming toward her in the distance are small flashing lights. they rise on hill and then fall behind another. they appear again. soon, she can make out the form of an ambulance, and its highway patrol escort. the vehicles move slowly toward her, without sirens, as deathly quiet as their cargo. she stands to the side of the road as they approach. the highway patrol vehicle and the ambulance marked "texas department of corrections" pass silently in slow motion. she watches as they disappear back into the mist. in slow motion, she screams, falls to her knees wailing, but we cannot hear her. we hear nothing.}
