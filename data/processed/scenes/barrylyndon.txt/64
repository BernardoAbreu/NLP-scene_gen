<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{roderick happily riding along a wooded country road, rounds a blind bend and sees suddenly before him, about two hundred yards away, a company of prussian infantry resting along the sides of the road, together with a dozen mounted dragoons. a quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed than to turn back, and he rides into their midst, approaching a group of officers. he presents himself as lieutenant lakenham and asks for directions to join his regiment. he is told that he is riding in the wrong direction, and is shown a map. during the explanation, captain galgenstein approaches with an open, smiling countenance, introduces himself, and says he, too, is bound for the same place, and asks if roderick will honor him with his company. to avoid suspicion, roderick readily accepts the offer, and the two men mount up, and ride off together.}
