<A>__{five local men in fatigues scan the field slowly with hand held minesweepers. one man holds up his hand as his device beeps. at the edge of the field, fred murray blows a whistle. everybody else stops. the man bends down, as all wait... kathy approaches from the road, behind a fence. fred smiles.}

<D>__{i just wanted to follow up with you on the raid yesterday. those girls didn't show up at the shelter, and i wanted to locate them.}
<C>__{fred murray}
<D>__{yeah, the whole thing was a bit of a mess. turned out it was a local police mistake. mix up with the tip off or something. thought they had a prostitution bust, but the bar is legit and those girls were just waitresses.}
<C>__{kathy}
