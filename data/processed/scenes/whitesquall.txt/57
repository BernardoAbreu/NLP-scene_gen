<L>__{exterior curacao harbor dusk}
<A>__{as a blazing sun sizzles into the western sea, the albatross rounds a point and heads towards the docks several hundred yards away. on the dock, the students of the school wait. as soon as the ship is in view, they start to cheer. chuck squints.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what are they doing?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i can't make it out?}
<A>__{robin calls up to phil, who is at the wheelhouse.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{hey, phil... swing up the 'binocs' and tell us what you see.}
<A>__{phil picks up the binoculars and focuses.}
<C>__{phil}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{they're waving... handkerchiefs or something.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{maybe they're surrendering.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{wait a second...}
<A>__{phil lowers the binoculars and turns to skipper.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{they're girls! they're all girls!}
<A>__{skipper shares a knowing look with alice.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{gimme those.}
<A>__{tod snatches the binoculars.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{whhooooaaaaa!!!!!! women!!!}
<A>__{everyone on board rushes to the port side. every single person on the dock is a young girl waving a white handkerchief. spontaneous cheers from the boys. as the 'big a' pulls to the dock, john and tod run for the gunnel door and swing it open. the girls flood the deck.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{good morning, ladies.}
<A>__{they chatter in dutch and hurry aboard. like wall flowers, robin, phil and chuck stand on top of the chart house watching utopia unfold before them.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{what are we supposed to talk about?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{you've gotta be kidding?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{but, they don't speak english.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{there are some things that everybody does in the same language.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{like this!}
<A>__{phil reaches up for a free line. with a running start he swings out over the water...}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{yeeee haaaaa!!}
<A>__{he careens back onto the deck and lands in front of two startled, but impressed girls. robin and chuck applaud. phil takes a bow. all hell is breaking loose. skipper and alice welcome aboard the headmaster, ms. boyde, 50's, dumpy but tough.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{a very enthusiastic welcome.}
<C>__{ms. boyde}
<D>__{we don't often have guests. our girls have been looking forward to your visit for some time. welcome to curacao.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{thank you. you're all ready to sail then?}
<C>__{ms. boyde}
<D>__{i should think so.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i'm sure they won't be disappointed.}
<A>__{a man's voice bellows up from the dock.}
<C>__{francis }
<D>__{ahoy there!!}
<A>__{everyone stops and freezes. phil turns, disbelieving. it's his parents, francis and peggy boutillier, standing next to a limousine dressed in brightly colored tourist garb.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{surprise!}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{well, well. what do we have here? a floating brothel?}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(cool)}
<D>__{hardly.}
<A>__{francis comes aboard uninvited as usual.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(pointed)}
<D>__{and, of course, we are.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{well, you never can tell these days, can you?}
<A>__{skipper shoots a look over at phil who is staring a hole in the deck.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{what is it we can do for you today?}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{it's not monotonous.}
<A>__{francis flushes red.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{never the less...}
<A>__{he turns and joins peggy on the dock. phil is suddenly full of rage. this is an invasion of his privacy. everyone feels it.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{hop to boy. we haven't got all day.}
<A>__{phil's anger turns to resigned humiliation. he stops, staring down at his parents. skipper puts a hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{i didn't know, phil.}
<A>__{phil nods, head down and walks down the ramp. all watch him go, feeling for him.}
