<A>__{the pandemonium has now ceased. those who could escape have; the rest are lined up against the wall in frisking position. gondorff and hooker lie on the floor dead. the loudspeaker drones on. singleton is still calling the race from his booth, apparently oblivious to what's happened.}

<C>__{polk}
<D>__{he's gone.}
<A>__{hooker opens his eyes and slowly drags himself up off the floor, spitting out a little rubber bladder, filled with blood, that he's had in his mouth. gondorff does likewise. niles, twist, singleton and the rest of the boost begin to laugh and shake hands, as do the federal agents.}

<D>__{you wanta wait for your share?}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{naw, i'd just blow it.}
<A>__{gondorff nods, and walks slowly to behind the bar. he comes out with his suitcase in one hand and hooker's paper bag in another. he throws the paper bag to hooker, who stops by the door. eirie kid is standing there. hooker gives the "office" to eirie, who beams and gives it back.}
