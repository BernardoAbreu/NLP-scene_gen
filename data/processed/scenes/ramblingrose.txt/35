<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{a pov shot of rose at the foot of the porch steps. a tentative little smile is on her face. it is very plain she is nervous and frightened.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{hello. i'm rose, and i've come to live with you and your family.}
<A>__{silence. the damn boy says nothing. a trifle crestfallen, rose moistens his lips and swallows. she ventures another little smile and the camera follows her as she walks up the steps. the at times insufferable buddy comes into the shot. he still has his hands on his hips daddy style and his expression is inscrutable, neither friendly nor hostile.}
<C>__{rose }
<D>__{what's your name? what do they call you?}
<A>__{finally, the boy speaks and he is not so bad. he's a child after all.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{lots of things. buddy, mostly.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(greatly reassured, a real smile now)}
<D>__{buddy. well, now, that's a nice name, i like it. i am real pleased to meet you.}
<P>__{(solemnly holds out her hand, they shake)}
<D>__{hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{sure. let me take your suitcase.}
<A>__{a warm and beautiful smile comes on rose's face and a little twinkle comes into her eyes. the innocence and sweetness are not lost, that is never lost, but this is a girl who likes boys and men.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{you're sweet.}
