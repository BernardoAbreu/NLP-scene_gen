<L>__{interior bedroom (l.a.) day}
<A>__{vince benedict lies in bed, looking extremely pleased with himself. a sexy young woman is nestled asleep against him. the digital bedside alarm purrs and starts to play music something romantic that vince hums along to.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{you sleep well, honey?}
<C>__{carla }
<D>__{mmmm... like a baby.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{me, too. i love this new mattress. it's soft but it's hard at the same time. and i love this new clock.}
<A>__{carla snuggles against vince as he surveys the bedroom like a house proud new owner.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{you've done a great job on this room, carla.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{you really think so? even the curtains?}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{the curtains are the key to the whole thing. they're colorful... they're brilliant... they're... great curtains.}
<C>__{carla}
<P>__{(melting)}
<D>__{you were great last night, vince.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(not disagreeing)}
<D>__{naaaw...}
<P>__{(putting his arm around her)}
<D>__{i think we're going to be very happy here.}
<A>__{suddenly we hear a door downstairs as it opens, and a man's voice drifts up the stairs:}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{honey! i'm home!}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(a bit surprised but not panicked)}
<D>__{what's he doing back so early?}
<A>__{vince jumps out of bed, starts pulling on his clothes while carla slips into a bathrobe.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{carla? you gonna cook me some breakfast or what?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{be right down, sweetheart!}
<A>__{vince checks his appearance in a dresser mirror, straightens his armani suit, brushes his hair, pulls it into a fashionable ponytail. he cuts a stylish figure. noticing an expensive gold lighter on the dresser top, he covertly pockets it. carla pushes him towards the open french doors.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{hurry up! i gotta make breakfast!}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{you're wonderful, carla. your husband doesn't deserve to kiss your feet.}
