<A>__{with the camera moving through masses of thick, steamy vaporous clouds, swirling about, rising boilingly up from some unseen, underground source. the camera continues moving through clouds. and then... the vulcan landscape. harsh, strange angular peaks and rock formations the barren, legend ary mountain home of vulcan masters.}
<L>__{exterior vulcan ledge spock ( m & f.p.)}
<A>__{spock's lean features instantly recognizable despite unkempt, longer hair and the fatigue born of a long, harsh discipline he has undergone. his robes, tattered and dust covered, are that of a vulcan aspirant in study with the masters. under the v'ger theme music we hear a voice in ritual tones:}
<C>__{female master's voice}
<D>__{spock, son of sarek of vulcan... and of amanda of earth... diligently you have labored for purification of mind...}
<A>__{reverse angle spock, vulcan masters and ruins in b.g., gigantic ancient vulcan statues and ruins. in f.g., the stone platform on which spock stands facing a semi circle of three similar platforms. on them in regal robes are three vulcan masters. the master in the center is a female, the other two masters are male. the elderly female is holding a cord and ancient pendant as if ready to place it around spock's neck at an appropriate moment. spock is staring up as v'ger theme music fades.}
<C>__{male master}
<P>__{(chidingly)}
<D>__{spock . . . !}
<A>__{spock turns, giving a small contrite nod the ritual continues.}
<C>__{female master}
<D>__{here are these sands, our fore bearers cast out their animal passions. here our race was saved by the first attainment of kolinahr.}
<C>__{male master}
<D>__{kolinahr: the final shedding of all emotion.}
<C>__{female master}
<D>__{you have labored long, spock. now receive from us this symbol of total logic.}
<A>__{spock starts to kneel... the female master moves in, intending to put the ancient pendant around his neck. but spock now hesitates he's troubled as though uncertain he deserves this symbol and waves the pendant away. then, a faint reprise of the v'ger theme music now causes the female master to look skyward. she turns from this back to spock as she exchanges a look with the male masters.}
<C>__{female master}
<P>__{(gestures spock forward)}
<D>__{come, give me your thoughts.}
<A>__{she kneels with spock lays her hands on his temples in vulcan mind meld position.}
<C>__{female master}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{our minds, spock... one and together....}
<A>__{their eyes close their minds meld then her head jerks slightly, her features change as her mind feels spock's reactions to the v'ger consciousness. a long moment, then she opens her eyes, gets to her feet and looks down on the still kneeling spock. then, she casts aside the pendant she carries it falls into the dust.}
<C>__{female master}
<P>__{(continuing; sadly)}
<D>__{this consciousness which calls it stirs your human half, spock? you have not achieved kolinahr your human emotions are not fully extinguished.}
<P>__{(turns to the other masters)}
<D>__{he will not achieve his goal with us. his answer lies elsewhere.}
<A>__{the three masters leave spock watches them go, his disappointment evident even in his stoic features. med. angle on spock (m. & f.p.) camera closes in on his face as we again hear a frag ment of v'ger theme music spock again raises his head and peers up into the heavens. hold on his face a moment, then...}
