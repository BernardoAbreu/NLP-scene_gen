<T>__{slow dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior palatial georgetown estate early morning}
<A>__{mr. perkins emerges from a guest cottage, flanked by his aide harry.}
<C>__{aide}
<D>__{...they'll push for dismantlement of our apparatus in chile, but we've got a degree of plausible deniability...}
<A>__{harry's foot comes down on a circular slab of stone and a voice from the grave says:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{stay very still.}
<A>__{stops him in his tracks, stops him dead as charly baltimore steps from the nearby trees. stands, twenty yards downrange. beretta leveled at both of them. two months, you barely notice the limp. she stands there in sleeveless top and short skirt and looks like a million. thumbs a metal box, click ! a red arming light blinks on.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{good morning, i'm charly. the slab you're standing on is actually a land mine. keep your foot on the pressure plate, nothing happens. step off the stone, we'll all be wearing you.}
<A>__{perkins steps forward. the gun shifts. targets him.}
<C>__{perkins}
<D>__{charly, i know we've treated you poorly, please, it was just business }
<A>__{she reaches in a pocket. tosses him a cellular phone he catches it as though it were a live snake.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{my terms are these. call state and order full disclosure on your personal correspondence. then disband chapter, effective immediately. in exchange...? i won't shoot you, and i won't make you stand on that mine. i won't touch you. i won't touch you. i promise.}
<C>__{perkins}
<D>__{you... you promise.}
<A>__{he swallows hard. looks to his aide... back to her... dials. charly takes a deep breath. scans the flowers, face placid. it's really quite lovely today. maybe she'll start a garden. perkins clicks off. look at charly:}
<C>__{perkins}
<D>__{it's done. now, you promise... you won't shoot me... won't make me get on the mine...?}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{i promise.}
<A>__{she smiles. shifts her aim and shoots the other guy. perkins' eyes widen in sudden realization. he lunges forward, grabs the aide, holding him up... desperately propping his dead weight atop the land mine...}
<C>__{perkins}
<D>__{goddamn you, i can't hold him... you bitch... you fucking bitch...!}
