<L>__{exterior overpass abutment night}
<A>__{wham! the corvette hits at a million mph. crumpling, disintegrating, and hurling two bodies bouncing off the abutment. the cavalry cruisers and plainwraps too late. a half dozen cars bearing down all lights and sirens. screeching to a halt by what used to be a silver porsche. the ruptured gas tank spurting gasoline. a cruiser screeches to a halt. both doors fly open. toomey and larkin step out. toomey on his radio as larkin looks up the embankment, catches a glimpse of... alex battered but alive, jerkily unclenches his fist, still holding the lighter, glow fading. he tosses... the cigarette lighter arcs down onto the ex corvette. wider boom! cops shield themselves as the crash scene explodes in a huge fireball that engulfs a cruiser stopped too close by. in the too close cop car the driver rams the car into reverse. tires squeal as the fireball hits and... the too close cruiser engine compartment ignites, a second fireball racing backward into another cruiser. boom! total chaos now. larkin focussed on alex, seen vaguely through the flames. moving toward him. with larkin as he arrives at the top of the enbankment, draws his weapon. hyperalert. alex is gone, but he finds... erlich's body two hundred broken boned bagged by bruises. larkin pulls something out of erlich's shattered fist. it's... "the list" dutton and erlich crossed off. larkin and toomey yet to go, but the first letters of their names are all contained in a vertical oval, "delt" circled in red. larkin, as toomey joins him they give each other an oh shit look. then larkin checkes his fingertips, smeared red from... "the list" flip side the crow cipher, rendered thick in coagulating blood. illuminated by the flickering light of the fire below.}
