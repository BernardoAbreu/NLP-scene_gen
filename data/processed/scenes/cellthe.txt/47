<L>__{interior the cell night}
<A>__{click. water sprays from the shower. caught by surprise, julia blocks the spray with her hands and searches for a shut off valve. of course, there is none. thirty seconds later, the water stops. like an animal caught in a trap, julia's eyes dart around her "cage." what kind of hell is this? shivering, she catches herself in the mirror and looks deeply into it. something's odd about the glass. is someone watching her? she bangs on it with her fist.}

<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{pound, pound, pound!}
<C>__{julia }
<D>__{let me out!!!}
<A>__{but there's no response. only her reflection.}
