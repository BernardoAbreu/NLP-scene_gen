<L>__{interior stobrod's hut, cherokee village. night}
<A>__{the fire burns, a pall of smoke. stobrod lies on the ground, swathed in blankets. coughs. ruby sits next to him, wipes the hair from his forehead. ada opens her eyes, looks, closes them, listens to the fire, a strange squeaking as it burns.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{that wood that sound when it burns that mean more snow?}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{yes, it do, country girl.}
<L>__{exterior track, cold mountain. dawn}
<A>__{first light. the sun creeps up, a red streak of dawn. inman walking, his head bent to the tracks. he walks quickly, even as the terrain gets more steep. as he bends to the snow where a spot of blood has fallen into a hoof print a flake of snow lands on his hand. then a second. he looks up. the snow falls. he starts to move more quickly, racing the snow as it seeks to erase the tracks. the snow thickens.}
