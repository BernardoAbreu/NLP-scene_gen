<L>__{exterior las vegas night}
<A>__{angle on various neon vegas landmarks the golden nugget, caesar's palace, bally's, etc. scrunched in between two larger hotels and casinos is the moonlight hotel and casino. the moonlight isn't all that small, it's just seen better days.}
<L>__{interior lounge night}
<A>__{a spotlight hits a solitary figure on a small stage. the man is caped and dramatic, but not especially talented; an elvis impersonator who's just a shade off in voice, looks and style.}
<C>__{elvis}
<D>__{good evening, ladies and gentlemen. are you lonesome tonight? welcome to the moonlight hotel and casino's incredible platinum oldies spectacular.}
<A>__{backstage, there's still a look of resolve in christy's eye as she waits to go on with michelle and tina, her back up singers.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{but you can't quit. what'll happen to us?}
<P>__{(to tina)}
<D>__{tell her she can't quit.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{i told her. she stuck pantyhose in my mouth.}
<A>__{onstage, elvis glances into the wings to be sure the ronelles are ready.}
<C>__{elvis}
<D>__{please welcome our own girl group extraordinaire, our beehives of beauty the fabulous ronelles!}
<A>__{elvis disappears. the spotlight hits christy, who wears a high beehive wig and a sequinned, early supremes style gown. michelle and tina wear matching gowns and wigs. the band begins a doo wop vamp.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{oh, girls.}
<C>__{ronelles}
<D>__{yes, betty?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{this prom is a real drag.}
<C>__{ronelles}
<D>__{oh huh.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{oh my!}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<C>__{ronelles}
<D>__{what is it, betty?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{look at that. get a gander.}
<C>__{ronelles}
<D>__{oh my!}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{he's so dreamy. he's like... a greek god. he's the cutest guy here. he's boss. he's fab. he's...}
<C>__{ronelles}
<D>__{yes, betty?}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{he's so fine.}
<C>__{ronelles}
<D>__{d00 lang, doo lang, d00 lang.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{wish he was mine. that handsome boy over there, the one with the wavy hair.}
<A>__{as they sing, their moves and gestures are carefully choreographed in vintage girl group style. a lot of talent and hard work has clearly gone into the number. while christy does her best, her singing voice is not on a par with those of the other ronelles. the lounge itself is practically empty, except for a few drunken shriners and a couple of college kids. police lieutenant eddie mulcahy sits at a ringside table with his eyes locked on christy. an easygoing charmer, eddie gives her a wink, but she responds with an up yours look and a turn to the other half of the room as the song continues.}
