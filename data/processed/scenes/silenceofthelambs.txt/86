<L>__{interior the surveillance van day (driving)}
<A>__{the van is crammed with an impressive array of hi tech equipment, all clicking and humming. burroughs is talking quietly on a scrambler phone, while another agent works a computer.}
<C>__{crawford }
<D>__{maybe we can locate some of raspail's old lovers. maybe, someday...}
<B>__{clarice and crawford}
<A>__{sit in swivel seats at the rear, by a big window. clarice can't resit an occasional peak at the trailing motorcade, awed and a bit thrilled to be the center of so much attention.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{but for catherine martin, it all comes down to you and lecter. you're the one he talks to.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{he's already offered to help... what would happen if we just showed our cards asked him for bill?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{he offered to help, starling, not to snitch. that wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. remember, lecter looks mainly for fun. never forget fun.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{but if he knew we have so little time }
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{if we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. he'll let the senator keep hoping, day after day, until catherine finally washes up. that'd be the most fun of all.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i think he means it, this time. i think he'll deal.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{what would it take?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{transfer to a new prison. with a view of trees, he said, or even water... can we swing that?}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{state to federal jurisdiction... we can do it eventually but we'll never get all the clearances in time. can you convince him a deal's already in place?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{you'll back me up with some paperwork?}
<P>__{(he nods)}
<D>__{then i will try. but wouldn't this have more weight coming from the senator herself?}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{she doesn't know what we're up to. and we can't afford to let her find out.}
<A>__{clarice looks at him, surprised.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{she's the mother, starling. she can't possibly comprehend what lecter is. she'd make the mistake of pleading with him. begging him... he'd feast on her pain till the last second of that girl's life...}
