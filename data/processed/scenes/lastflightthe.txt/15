<A>__{strolling down the sidewalk four abreast, as if they own the town, come our heroes bill, shep, francis and cary in smart hats and dinner clothes. outwardly, they seem to have recovered from their wounds. but: shep still wears his dark glasses and we occasionally glimpse his eye twitching. cary's bandages are gone but he has not regained full use of his hands. his personality is dark and dry, more subdued than shep's, and he comes across as the most levelheaded, rational member of the group its unacknowledged leader. francis seems to have suffered the greatest toll psychologically. a narcoleptic, strangely detached and unemotional much of the time, always on the verge of dozing off, his speech slurs even when he isn't drunk. only the athlete of the group, bill a burly texan whose full name is william talbot is in outstanding physical shape. but he is reckless, restless, and temperamental, covering up unnamed insecurities with bravado and forced exuberance.}
