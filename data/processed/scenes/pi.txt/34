<A>__{sol and max sit on either side of a half played go board.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{listen to me. the ancient japanese considered the go board to be a microcosm of the universe. although when it is empty it appears to be simple and ordered, in fact, the possibilities of game play are endless. they say that no two go games have ever been alike. just like snowflakes. so, the go board actually represents an extremely complex and chaotic universe. that is the truth of our world, max. it can't be easily summed up with math. there is no simple pattern.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{but as a go game progresses, the possibilities become smaller and smaller. the board does take on order. soon, all moves are predictable.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{so, maybe, even though we're not sophisticated enough to be aware of it, there is an underlying order...a pattern, beneath every go game. maybe that pattern is like the pattern in the market, in the torah. the two sixteen number.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{that is insanity, max.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{or maybe it's genius. i have to get that number.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{hold on, you have to slow down. you're losing it, you have to take a breath. listen to yourself. you're connecting a computer bug i had, a computer bug you might have had, and some religious hogwash. if you want to find the number two sixteen in the world, you'll be able to pull it out of anywhere. two hundred and sixteen steps from your street comer to your front door. two hundred and sixteen seconds you spend riding on the elevator. when your mind becomes obsessed with anything, it will filter everything else out and find examples of that thing everywhere. three hundred and twenty, four hundred and fifty, twenty three. whatever! you've chosen two sixteen and you'll find it everywhere in nature. but max, as soon as you discard scientific rigor, you are no longer a mathematician. you become a numerologist. what you need to do is take a break from your research. you need it. you deserve it here's a hundred dollars, i want you to take it. if ,you won't take it, borrow it. either way, take a break. spend it however you like as long as it falls in the category of vacation. real world stuff, okay. no math.}
<A>__{max looks at his bands.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{just try it. in a week you'll laugh about this. c'mon, max. think about it!}
<A>__{max gives a half nod.}
