<A>__{theres no stairmaster here, no leather sofa or bar...its small, cramped and cluttered, the walls littered with tire inventory and price lists... jack takes a slow, sad lap around the office. he makes it to the small wooden desk at the far end of the room and sits down behind it... on the desk are photos of jack, kate and the kids, a plastic michelin man model, a tire themed day calendar and a small plastic figurine of a bowler, the word, bowlers do it in an alley embossed on its base... he surveys the desktop briefly, then opens the top drawer, finding a personal checkbook and looking inside... he sees the bottom line and winces, then puts it back... jack picks up the bowlers do it in an alley figurine and gives it a good look...}
