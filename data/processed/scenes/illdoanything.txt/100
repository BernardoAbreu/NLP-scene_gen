<L>__{interior cathy's office day}
<A>__{cathy is in mid conversation with millie. matt enters and boldly says his piece.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i'm a free man. let's go to your house and break the answering machine.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{you know, i could get away now. but i've got a big meeting later. we'd better take two cars.}
<A>__{millie, having been at the screen test viewing, is taken aback, looking from one to the other. cathy knows what she's thinking and is unnerved, feeling silently accused, as she leads matt out.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{see you later. thanks again.}
