<A>__{an installation which also includes a double position transporter, in which we see the transporter effect begin. with the transporter crew is scott. he's with a technician, busy with a piece of complex circuitry. then he turns, sees that it is kirk beaming in here. as kirk materializes, steps off the transporter plat form, scott moves quickly to him.}
<B>__{kirk and scott}
<A>__{the starship engineering officer clearly surprised to see kirk here. kirk has the same look of grim de termination we just saw in the headquarters building.}

<D>__{... the only starship in interception range is the enterprise! ready, or not, she launches in twelve hours!}
<A>__{scott throws kirk an appalled look but is now occupied in sealing the outer pod door and manipulating drive controls. camera continues to pull back to reveal front of the pod and arms of the office complex as pod disconnects and starts to move.}
