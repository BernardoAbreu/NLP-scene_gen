<T>__{fade out:}
<L>__{interior living room boardinghouse night}
<A>__{it is about 3:30 the following evening. helen is sitting in a chair leafing through a magazine. she is dressed to go out. a corner of the dining room can be seen, where mr. and mrs. barley are playing cards with mr. krull. mrs. crockett, the landlady, enters from the hall on her way to the dining room and notices helen.}
<C>__{mrs. crockett}
<D>__{going out, dear?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes, i'm waiting for tom to pick me up.}
<C>__{mrs. crockett}
<P>__{(with a shudder)}
<D>__{personally, i won't go out after dark these days.}
<P>__{(with an attempt at slyness)}
<D>__{but then i'm not courting, am i?}
<A>__{she turns to go on into the dining room and as she does so almost bumps into klaatu who is coming out, having been kibitzing the card game.}
<C>__{mrs. crockett}
<P>__{(thoroughly startled)}
<D>__{oh mr. carpenter !}
<A>__{klaatu steps aside as she hurries nervously into the dining room. he turns, puzzled, to find helen watching with a slight smile.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{everyone seems so }
<P>__{(he shakes his hands}
<D>__{to indicate}
<P>__{nervousness)}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{jittery is the word.}
<A>__{helen watches him, a little uneasy in his presence. she is fond of him, and she can't help being curious and concerned about his brush with the police.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(with a contemplative smile)}
<D>__{bobby's the only person i know who isn't jittery.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he has his homework to keep him occupied.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(fondly, sincerely)}
<D>__{he's a fine boy, mrs. benson.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{naturally i think so.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{warm and friendly and intelligent }
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{you know he's the only real friend i've made since i've been here.}
<A>__{helen is deeply moved by klaatu's affection for the boy, she tried to dismiss her curiosity about him, but she can't. she decides to face it.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(hesitantly and with some difficulty)}
<D>__{mr. carpenter this is none of my business, but why did that detective come here last night?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(with easy frankness)}
<D>__{oh they just wanted to ask me a few questions. bobby and i tried to see professor barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. apparently they thought i was looking for secrets of some kind.}
<A>__{helen has reacted in puzzlement at this second mention of barnhardt. they are interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell. helen goes to answer it.}
