<L>__{interior paris sewers day}
<A>__{valjean is pulling marius after him down a tight sloping pipe, where dark water races. suddenly they start to slide, then drop through a vent into a wide sewage tunnel. faint light reflecting off the slime of curving tunnel walls. the skitter of rats. sodden forms floating by: dead bodies. valjean carries marius down the tunnel, moving as fast as he can, losing strength all the time. he reaches an intersection where four sewers meet. light falls through distant gratings. one of the four sewers is dry. here he lets his burden down, and himself sinks to the slimy ground to rest. he lets his eyes close. a voice echoes in the shadows.}
<C>__{thenardier}
<D>__{here's a hint of gold stuck into a tooth pardon me, m'sieur, you won't be needing it no more. shouldn't be too hard to sell.}
<A>__{a figure coming closer. a sewer thief, robbing corpses. no sign of life in either valjean or marius.}
<C>__{thenardier}
<D>__{well, someone's got to clean'em up, my friends, before the little harvest disappears into the mud. someone's got to collect their odds and ends when the gutters run with blood.}
<A>__{now we see the thief is thenardier. he finds a ring on marius's finger and pulls it off.}
<C>__{thenardier}
<D>__{here's a tasty ring pretty little thing heart's no longer going and he's lived his little time, but his watch is ticking yet. it's a world where the dog eats the dog. where they kill for the bones in the street. and god in his heaven, he don't interfere cos he's dead as the stiff at my feet! i raise my eyes to see the heavens and only the moon looks down. the harvest moon shines down!}
<A>__{valjean wakes, rears up, seizes thenardier by the arm, slams him against the sewer wall.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{how do i get out of here?}
<C>__{thenardier}
<D>__{there! that way!}
<A>__{valjean drops him, picks marius up once more, and sets off. thenardier stares after them, grinning. he's sent then the wrong way. later valjean in the sewers, marius on his back, and they're sinking ever deeper into the slimy water. as he feels himself sink, valjean holds marius up in his arms and forges on, chest deep, lifting the younger man above his head. still he sinks, until his face is half submerged and he's gagging in the filth. he stumbles, and suddenly he's sunk beneath the surface, and marius is dropping then up he bursts again, face black with slime, eyes burning with his refusal to be beaten. later valjean staggers down the endless sewers, marius on his back. but all the time he can hear, closer now, the rushing sound of the river. round a bend and at last moonlight ahead. he drags himself on through the shallow running water towards the moonlight. he reaches the exit at last. before him the river.}
