<A>__{a few landings down... a noise. the two troopers freeze. the stairwell is dark. the noise grows louder. the troopers ready their weapons. the sounds are little scraping thumps, like the weary foot falls of someone... something... trying to negotiate the stairs... there is the low, wheezing sound of laboured breath. the men stare at the landing below. the black man steps forward slightly, trying not to make a sound. suddenly, a figure pops out of the darkness. it falls against the wall below. both troopers raise their guns. the figure pulls away from the wall. in the mist, it's shape is ghostly... robed... in black... is sees the troopers...}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{senores... please to let me pass...}
<A>__{the voice weakens into a low wheezing cough. the figure slumps and sits on the steps, clinging to the railing. it is an old priest, obviously from a local puerto rican parish. roger stoops next to the old man, who is struggling to keep his breath. he is weary. he seems to be near death. he clutches at his chest. roger tries to support him.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{let's get him to the medics...}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{no... no... no... please. just... let me pass... my sister... i go up to seven floor... to find my sister...}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{they're takin' everyone down... they probably brought her down... come one...}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{my sister... she is dead... they tell me... the dead they do not bring down.}
<A>__{roger and the black trooper shoot glances at one another.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{just let me pass. martinez is dead. the people of 107 will do what you wish now. these simple people... but strong... they have little... but they do not give it up easily. and they give up their dead... to no one!}
<A>__{the priest goes into a coughing fit. the troopers look on. roger wants to help in some way.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{many have died on these streets in the last weeks... in the basement of this building you find them...}
<A>__{the troopers are shocked. the priest struggles to his feet.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{i have given them the last rites. now... you do what you will...}
<A>__{the old man starts up the stairs. roger moves to help him, but the big black man stops him. the priest weaves up through the gas mist, coughing.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you are stronger than us... but soon, i think... they be stronger than you...}
<A>__{the old man's voice trails off up the stairwell as he disappears in the cloud...}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{when the dead walk, senores... we must stop the killing... or we lose the war...}
