<A>__{dekker at his desk, piles through mounds of paperwork. not sure what to look for, he goes through everything. his notes from the bank. the file on galt, harrington, chris lei. he even digs through conners and finally... callo's file. jenkins heads for the exit.}
<C>__{jenkins}
<D>__{you're still here?}
<C>__{dekker}
<P>__{(in complete work mode)}
<D>__{callo's insignificant.}
<C>__{jenkins}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{that's what he said, callo's insignificant. but he wasn't.}
<C>__{jenkins}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{lorenz... curtis... called me.}
<C>__{jenkins}
<D>__{he called you?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{he said he didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve it. he said callo was insignificant. but without callo he wouldn't have had the knowledge of our department and...}
<P>__{(grabs a clipboard)}
<D>__{... he wouldn't have had the front money to hire the crew.}
<C>__{jenkins}
<D>__{he was screwing with your head. go home, shane. you did good today. your dad would be proud. get some sleep. there will be more bad guys tomorrow.}
<A>__{jenkins exits. dekker falls back into his chair. then... discovers... callo's file... the property room sign out sheet. the signatures.}
