<A>__{john wakes to hammering on the door. the porch light flicks on and john is bathed in bright light he didn't realize he'd fallen asleep. david stands above him on the porch, holding the screen door open if he glanced down there is no way he wouldn't see him. john holds his breath and waits. the porch light flicks off, the locks are unbolted, and finally the thick door opens. as before, the two exchange words, but now the pounding in john's ears is so loud we can barely hear anything else. john takes a deep breath and springs to his feet knocking over the trash cans and onto the porch! he smacks david with the gun, grabs him by the hair and jams him forward into the doorway, preventing the supplier alex from slamming the door on them.}
