<A>__{we know this is terminator's pov because sarah and reese are just ahead of us. but the image is bizarre, alien. bright and hyper real. there is a hint of digitization, and the fleeing figures ahead are more luminous than the background, suggesting infra red. the margins of the frame are crammed with columns of crt type characters: columns of numbers and acronyms. the data changes more rapidly than any human eye could follow. there is no doubt that we are seeing as a machine would see. the sound effects are bright and clear, as if they are digitized and enhanced as well.}
