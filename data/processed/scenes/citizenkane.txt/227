<A>__{kane, in a truly terrible and absolutely silent rage, is literally breaking up the room yanking pictures, hooks and all off the wall, smashing them to bits ugly, gaudy pictures susie's pictures in susie's bad taste. off of occasional tables, bureaus, he sweeps susie's whorish accumulation of bric a brac. raymond stands in the doorway watching him. kane says nothing. he continues with tremendous speed and surprising strength, still wordlessly, tearing the room to bits. the curtains (too frilly overly pretty) are pulled off the windows in a single gesture, and from the bookshelves he pulls down double armloads of cheap novels discovers a half empty bottle of liquor and dashes it across the room. finally he stops. susie's cozy little chamber is an incredible shambles all around him. he stands for a minute breathing heavily, and his eye lights on a hanging what not in a corner which had escaped his notice. prominent on its center shelf is the little glass ball with the snowstorm in it. he yanks it down. something made of china breaks, but not the glass ball. it bounces on the carpet and rolls to his feet, the snow in a flurry. his eye follows it. he stoops to pick it up can't make it. raymond picks it up for him; hands it to him. kane takes it sheepishly looks at it moves painfully out of the room into the corridor.}
