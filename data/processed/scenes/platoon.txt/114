<L>__{exterior jungle elias' position day}
<A>__{elias a defiant look on his face moves fast but cautiously back across the church landmarks. chris following then rhah and crawford. the rain has now settled into a mist hugging the ground.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{move it! move it!}
<A>__{elias comes to a stop, looks. behind them we hear the sounds of battle, gauging their distance from the main body. the spider holes are still empty. but he listens, senses something out there getting closer.}
<C>__{elias }
<D>__{they're coming ...}
<A>__{chris looking at rhah. how does he know? elias points out an imaginary line across the breaking mist.}
<C>__{elias }
<D>__{stagger yourselves across this line, shoot anything that moves. they'll be coming from here.}
<C>__{rhah}
<P>__{(team leader)}
<D>__{gotcha.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{one of them gets through it's curtains.}
<C>__{rhah}
<D>__{where you going?}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{down along the river 'bout 100 metres, 'case they try to flank us there. third platoon's coming up on our rear so watch for 'em.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i will go with you.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{no ... i move faster alone.}
<P>__{(a grin)}
<A>__{elias, his pack stripped, is gone, like a fleet leaf, vanishing into the jungle.}
<C>__{rhah}
<P>__{(stringing them out)}
<D>__{okay crawford over here. taylor down twenty yards behind that tree.}
