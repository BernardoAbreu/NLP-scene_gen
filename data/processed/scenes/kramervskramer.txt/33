<B>__{on the front door}
<A>__{as we hear: sound effect: the doorbell rings. a moment later ted opens the door and thelma phillips enters. she is a neighbor (apt. 6 b) and joanna kramer's best friend. about four months ago thelma and her husband charley were divorced. until then the two families had been very close, the kramer's son (billy) being about the same age as the phillips' daughter (kim). with the divorce, however, the kramers tried to remain friends with both thelma and charley and that has caused a certain amount of friction. thelma is an attractive woman in her mid thirties. she dresses well, works out religiously at jack lalanne's and goes to a therapist twice a week. she is also given to acting the lay analyst with her friends. thelma is generous with her advice, sharing the wealth so to speak. with all of this she is kind, loyal and a loving friend. at the moment, however, she is all business.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(looking around, suspiciously)}
<D>__{all right. what's going on?}
<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{from his attitude it is clear that there is no love lost between them.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{all right, thelma, you want to know what's going on? i will tell you what's going on. i will tell you exactly what's going on.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{look, ted, all i}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(starting to really roll)}
<D>__{i came home tonight. we just got the fire and ice account at the agency. do you know what that means?! do you understand what that means? it means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{ted, all i wanted to know was where}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(not letting her get a word in edgewise)}
<D>__{i walk in the house and before i can say "how are you?", "did you have a nice day?" before i can say anything. pow she's out the door.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{ohmygod. didn't she say anything? she must've said something.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{ted, don't be so hostile.}
<A>__{ted draws himself upright with the dignity of the ambassador to the court of st. james. however, during the following, he begins pounding the pillows on the couch into shape with real vehemence.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{hostile?}
<P>__{(pow)}
<D>__{me?}
<P>__{(whack)}
<D>__{thelma, i'm not hostile.}
<P>__{(thud)}
<D>__{i am anything but hostile.}
<P>__{(sock)}
<D>__{but if you want to know what i am. i will tell you what i am. what i am is, i am hurt. i am very hurt. and i just want to know one thing, okay? just one thing... why? that's all i want to know... why?}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(how to say this)}
<D>__{ted, joanna and i used to talk a lot and... well, she told me a lot of... ah, things about the two of you.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(instantly nervous)}
<D>__{things? what kind of things?}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(clearly she knows}
<D>__{more than she's}
<P>__{willing to say)}
<D>__{i mean... things. ted, joanna's very unhappy and}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(flash of anger)}
<D>__{listen, joanna kramer's got a goddamn good life. she's got a husband that loves her. she's got a terrific kid. she's got a wonderful home}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(getting mad herself)}
<D>__{what d'you know about how joanna felt? you went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{did it ever occur to you guys that joanna kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?! did it?! for one thing she's always thirty minutes late. you can set your watch by it}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{so she's late. what's the big deal. that's just a way of saying, "pay attention to me."}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(not listening)}
<D>__{two. she is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it. thelma, do you know where i could be in this business if i had a wife that entertained or went out socially}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{oh for shit's sake, ted, you are the most selfish human being i have ever met. no wonder she said you came first, then billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{joanna said that?}
<A>__{thelma nods.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{then how come she never said anything like that to me?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{maybe she didn't feel like she should have to. maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(stung)}
<D>__{boy, you guys are really something, y'know? i'd like to know one thing, okay just one little thing. did you tell joanna she should leave me?}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(stiffly)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she turns and starts toward the front door, ted at her heel.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{y'know something thelma you are the typhoid mary of divorce. i mean it. joanna and i never had any trouble until you and charley split up.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{ted, divorce is a terrible thing. i know, i went through it. you've got to believe i did everything i could to get joanna to stay.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but i will tell you something. you may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for joanna to do what she just did.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child?}
<B>__{close on thelma}
<A>__{that stops her dead in her tracks. she had always assumed that joanna took billy with her when she left.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{joanna left billy? she didn't take him with her?}
<A>__{ted shakes his head. there is a long beat of silence.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(stunned, quiet)}
<D>__{oh shit.}
