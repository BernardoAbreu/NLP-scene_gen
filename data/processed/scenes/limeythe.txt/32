<A>__{wilson is taken outside and dumped. after a moment, he gets to his feet. dusting himself. reaches for another gun tucked in his lower back. he re enters the building. a beat. we hear several shots. seconds later, one of the meat puppets comes stumbling out of the door, terrified. he runs past us, fast. a moment later, wilson emerges, gun in hand.}
