<L>__{4, a cheap frame building the purpose of which is pretty}
<A>__{obvious. ruthie, warily alert lest she be caught, is peering in the door. she looks a long time and then she runs out of the scene. winfield is seen asleep in a quilt on the ground when ruthie enters and rousts him out.}
<C>__{ruthie}
<P>__{(in an excited whisper)}
<D>__{git up. i got sump'n to show you.}
<C>__{winfield}

<C>__{ruthie}
<P>__{(tugging him)}
<D>__{it's them white things, made outa dish stuff, like in the catalogues!}
<A>__{he stumbles after her. the exterior of sanitary unit no. 4. ruthie is putting on a bold front as she leads winfield into sight but she is still alert for interference.}
<C>__{ruthie}
<D>__{come on. ain't nobody gonna say anything.}
<C>__{winfield}
<D>__{won't they ketch us?}
<A>__{he follows her into the unit, big eyed with excitement and apprehension. there is a silence. then:}
<C>__{ruthie's voice}
<D>__{them's where you wash your han's.}
<A>__{another silence. then:}
<C>__{winfield's voice}

<D>__{well, i reckon you stan' in them little rooms an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there take a bath!}

<C>__{winfield's voice}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{ruthie's voice}
<P>__{(in alarm)}
<D>__{now don't you go monk'ing }
<A>__{there is the sound of a toilet flushing. it is a cheap toilet and it is a loud flush which eventually ends in a long refilling of the tank just as loudly. there is a paralyzed silence. then:}
<C>__{ruthie's voice}
<D>__{now you done it! you busted it!}
<C>__{winfield's voice}
<D>__{i never }
<A>__{terrified, winfield comes dashing out of the unit but ruthie grabs him just outside the door. beginning to cry, he struggles to get away.}
<C>__{winfield}
<D>__{lemme go! i didn't go to do it!}
<C>__{ruthie}
<P>__{(fiercely)}

<C>__{ruthie}
<D>__{i won't }
<P>__{(craftily)}
<D>__{ if you won't tell what i done!}
<A>__{he nods quickly. then ruthie begins to walk away with what she fancies is an innocent, nonchalant stroll, yawning casually. sniffling a little, winfield mimics her, a very innocent walk and yawn indeed. the scene dissolves to a ditch. alongside the ditch are some lengths of concrete pipe. tom and the two wallaces are in the ditch, tom and tim picking, wilkie shoveling.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(exulting)}
<D>__{if this don't feel good!}
<C>__{wilkie}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{wait'll about 'leven o'clock, see how good she feels then!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{seems like a nice frien'ly fella to work for, too.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say so.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. gettin' some work at las'.}
<A>__{mr. thomas, the farmer, a stock man wearing a paper sun helmet, enters. his face is worried as he squats down beside the ditch. what he has come to say has taken some effort and he is still uncertain and annoyed. the men stop work.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{lissen here. maybe i'm talkin' myself outa my farm, but i like you fellas, so i'm gonna tell you. you live in that gov'ment camp, don't you?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(stiffening)}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{and you have dances every saturday night?}
<C>__{wilkie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{we sure do.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{well, look out next saturday night.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(suddenly tense)}
<D>__{what you mean? i belong to the central committee. i got to know.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{don't you ever tell i told.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{thomas}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{well, the association don't like the government camps. can't get a deputy in there. can't arrest a man without a warrant. but if there was a big fight, and maybe shooting a bunch of deputies could go in and clean out the camp.}
<P>__{(unfolding a newspaper)}
<D>__{like last night. lissen. "citizens, angered at red agitators, burn another squatters' camp, warn agitators to get out of the county."}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(sick of the expression)}
<D>__{listen. what is these reds? ever'time you turn aroun' somebody sayin' somebody else's a red. what is these reds, anyway?}
<C>__{wilkie}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{well, i tell you. they was a fella up the country named king got about 30,000 acres an' a cannery an' a winery an' he's all a time talkin' about reds. drivin' the country to ruin, he says. got to git rid of 'em, he says. well, they was a young fella jus' come out an' he was listenin one day. he kinda scratched his head an' he says, "mr. king, what is these reds you all a time talkin' about?" well, sir, mr. king says, "young man, a red is any fella that wants thirty cents a hour when i'm payin' twenty five."}
<C>__{thomas}
<P>__{(fretfully)}
<D>__{i ain't talkin' about that one way or the other. all i'm saying is that there's going to be a fight in the camp saturday night. and there's going to be deputies ready to go in.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{but why? those fellas ain't botherin' nobody.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{i will tell you why. those folks in to being treated like humans. suppose the government closes its camps. suppose too many people pass through 'em. well, when those people go back to the squatters' camps they'll be hard to handle.}
<P>__{(wiping his brow)}
<D>__{go on back to work now. maybe i've talked myself into trouble, but you're folks like us, and i like you.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(extending his hand)}
<D>__{nobody won't know who tol'. we thank you.}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{an' they ain't gonna be no fight, either.}
<A>__{they shake hands. the scene dissolves to the gate to the camp, at night. it is saturday evening, the night of the dance. glaring electric lights hang over the open gate. parked jalopies line the highway as the invited guests, small farmers and migrants from other camps and their families, arrive to be greeted and checked by a committee of three men.}
<C>__{committee man}
<D>__{ev'nin', ma'am. who'd you say invited you?}
<C>__{guests}
<D>__{mister an' mizz clark, they ast us.}
<C>__{committee man}
<D>__{yes, ma'am. come right in, ma'am.}
<A>__{there is an air of eager anticipation, of gay celebration, and everyone is in his or her best the men in clean washed overalls, clean shirts, some with ties, their hair damp and slicked down, the women in their nicest. through the gate, inside the camp, can be seen the outdoor dance floor, brightly lighted, with the camp musicians already tuning up, and around the dance floor scores of wide eyed children. inside the gate to the camp, we see wilkie and a dark complexioned man named jule standing among a group inside watching the arrivals. they watch sharply, eyeing everyone, listening to every credential. as his employer, thomas, comes through the gate with his wife, wilkie grins and greets him with a handshake.}
<C>__{wilkie}
<D>__{hidy, mr. thomas. hidy, mizz thomas.}
<C>__{thomas}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{you watching out, ain't you?}
<C>__{wilkie}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{don't you worry. ain't gonna be no trouble.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{i hope you know what you're talking about.}
<P>__{(he moves away, wilkie grinning after him)}
<A>__{we see the dance floor, and after three pats of the foot, to get the tempo, the home talent dance orchestra swings into music. inside the joad tent, rosasharn dressed in her nicest, sits gripping her hands together, the music seeming to bring her to the verge of tears.}
<C>__{rosasharn}
<D>__{ma...}
<P>__{(ma turns from drying dishes)}
<D>__{ma, i i can't go to the dance. i jus' can't ma. i can't hardly stan' it, with connie not here an' me this way.}
<C>__{ma}
<P>__{(trying to cheer her)}
<D>__{why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.}
<C>__{rosasharn}
<P>__{(miserably)}
<D>__{i can't he'p it, ma. it don't make me giggly an' happy.}
<A>__{drying her hands, ma sits beside rosasharn and takes her in her arms.}
<C>__{ma}
<P>__{(tenderly)}
<D>__{you an' me's goin' together jus' you an' me. we're a goin' to that dance an' we're a goin' to jus' set an' watch. if anybody says to come dance why i will say you're poorly. but you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.}
<C>__{rosasharn}
<D>__{an' you won't let nobody touch me?}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{no an' look what i got for you.}
<A>__{smiling mysteriously, ma fishes in a pocket in her dress and brings out the envelope of her treasures. from it she produces the earrings and holds them up in front of rosasharn's wide eyes.}
<C>__{ma}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i used to wear these when your pa come callin' on me.}
<P>__{(then as she puts}
<D>__{them on rosasharn's}
<P>__{ears)}
<D>__{you'll look pretty in 'em tonight.}
<A>__{they smile at each other, proud in the luxury of ornaments. down the road from the gate a touring car with six men pulls of the pavement and stops. three men get out. they are bareheaded and dressed similar to the other migrants. they stroll down the highway toward the gate. the other men, deputies, sit watching them.}
