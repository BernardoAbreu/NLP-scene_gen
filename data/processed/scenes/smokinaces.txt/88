<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior "tahoe skillet" restaurant morning}
<A>__{the feds occupy a booth, black coffee for both. carruthers clicks off a cellphone. messner is engrossed in a file clipped with old surveillance photographs of primo sparazza.}
<C>__{carruthers}
<D>__{spotter on the lake confirmed israel. penthouse level. there was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. he wasn't involved. he's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{no rest for the wicked.}
<P>__{(beat, holds up file)}
<D>__{why were we never shown these files? we're sitting on sparazza for what? six months now and we're just seeing this?}
<P>__{(beat, reading)}
<D>__{did you know that he's has had thirty six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?}
<P>__{(flips, reads)}
<D>__{elective plastic surgery, every single one }
<A>__{messner, turning the file toward carruthers, pointing.}
<C>__{messner }
<D>__{ look at this, look at the work he's had done; nose, three times, eyes, eyelids, chin, jaw he's had his jaw done a dozen times.}
<C>__{messner }
<D>__{you take every hasbeen actor in hollywood they haven't been cut this much.}
<A>__{messner flips to another part of the file.}
<C>__{messner }
<D>__{unreal, this guys jacket too. wall to wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny }
<P>__{(beat, points)}
<D>__{ a paternity suit...i just feel like we're playing catch up with all this and we shouldn't be.}
<C>__{carruthers}
<D>__{welcome to the new bureau. nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{based on what we had, i thought sparazza was a mid level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west.}
<A>__{carruthers nods, sips his coffee.}
<C>__{carruthers}
<D>__{he's stayed below the radar. you don't kill a hundred and thirty people without knowing how to tip toe.}
<A>__{messner flips the file, finds a page paper clipped with a photograph of murder martyred federal agent freeman heller.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{but the bureau knew sparazza killed heller. why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?}
<C>__{carruthers}
<D>__{heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, hoover blackballed their memory. look at ness.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{yeah, but the untouchables took down capone. heller got shot and killed. the bad guys beat him. worse, sparazza walked.}
<A>__{messner sits back, kills the remainder of his coffee, gazing out the window, watching sightseers stream by. carruthers glances at his watch.}
<C>__{carruthers}
<D>__{it's almost five a.m. in d.c. now. locke said the lawyers from justice had been in there since three o'clock yesterday afternoon. israel's manager is acting as his attorney and that's what's holding things up.}
<A>__{the waitress arrives with breakfast, sets it down.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{so he has no idea what's about to happen?}
<C>__{carruthers}
<D>__{no. and i want to be in that room a half second after mecklen calls to say the deal's done. we've got a sheriff's task force on stand by.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{what about the hotel staff obstructing us. israel's obviously paid off the management.}
<C>__{carruthers}
<D>__{tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.}
<P>__{(beat, grins)}
<D>__{trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. you show 'em your id with the letters "f.b.i." in all caps and it's instant compliance. i've seen in happen a hundred times.}
