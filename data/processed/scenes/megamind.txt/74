<A>__{master mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder like he's a short timer in da nang. roxanne follows shortly behind him.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{master mind turns around.}
<C>__{roxanne }
<D>__{are you following me or something?}
<C>__{master mind}

<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{don't walk away from me when i'm talking to you.}
<A>__{finally it occurs to her what's going on.}
<C>__{roxanne }
<D>__{what a minute...all that stuff you use to say to me when uberman was alive about me being the loyal queen by your side as you rule over metro city. that wasn't just super villain rhetoric, was it? you actually meant it!}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{my, someone has a rather high opinion of themselves.}
<A>__{they stare at each other in silence, their glares locked in conflict.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{do you really think i would be with someone like you?}
<A>__{this stings master mind to the bone. and after a brief contemplation, he reaches the only logical, painful conclusion.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{with that, master mind exits into the night, leaving roxanne with a baffled expression on her face.}
