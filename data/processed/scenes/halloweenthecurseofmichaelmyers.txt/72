<A>__{debra, silhouetted at the top of the stairs, hits a light switch; a naked bulb springs to life. slowly she descends the rickety staircase. the basement, pitch dark save for a spear of sunlight shooting through an elevated window, is overrun with cobwebs, rusted tools and broken bicycle parts. a clunker of a washing machine rattles in the corner. debra makes space for the crate in a storage cabinet. suddenly the washing machine stops. nonplissed, she moves toward it. lifts the lid. the bed sheets inside are sopping wet. opening the electrical fuse box, she flicks a switch back and forth a few times but the washing machine doesn't respond.}
