<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior hospital day}
<A>__{the battle sounds are now joined by a loudly ticking clock. with no sign of energy or emotion, shep and cary sit together on a hospital cot in full uniform. shep wears dark eyeglasses. cary has a coat draped over his hands. he glances off. we follow his gaze, panning past other patients in the hospital to a wall clock and calendar. it is november 11th and the time is almost eleven a. m. the battle's rumble drones on.}
<B>__{shep and cary}
<A>__{stare up at the clock. behind his dark glasses, shep's left eye twitches.}
<B>__{the clock}
<A>__{slowly dissolves to one last brief battle montage: soldiers yelling and running, guns firing noisily, a plane crashing, explosions. the final image is of a plane parked on the ground, its engine dying, its propeller slowing to a stop as we dissolve back to : the clock face. the center of the clock is lined up exactly with the center of the propeller the slowing propeller blades are replaced by the clock's hands as if to symbolically suggest that the war has ended but time goes on. the noise of battle fades and only the ticking of the clock remains. dissolve to : the calendar: november 11th, 1918 armistice day.}
