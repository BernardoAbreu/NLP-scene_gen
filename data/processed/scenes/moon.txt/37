<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior rec room day}
<A>__{gerty is cutting sam's hair. sam sitting back in a chair, barber shop style, while the robot snip snip snips away with a pair of scissors. sam is gently squeezing a stress ball in his right hand.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{sam, is everything okay?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{everything's fine, gerty.}
<A>__{for a moment there is no sound but the snipping scissors, reminiscent of keys snapping on a typewriter. then:}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{why do you ask?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{you don't seem like yourself today.}
<A>__{sam frowns, contemplative. for a moment we think he is going to tell gerty about the girl he saw earlier or imagined he saw. but he goes with something different.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's tess.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{has something happened?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no, not exactly.}
<A>__{gerty stops cutting, lowers the scissors.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{sam, what is it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{something doesn't feel right, that's all.}
<A>__{a beat. sam's fingers twitching around the red stress ball, squeezing harder.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{sam, it might help to talk about it.}
<A>__{sam decides to come clean.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{tess isn't responding to things.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{tess isn't responding to things?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{what kind of things?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{a couple of weeks ago i asked her if she wanted to go on vacation when i get back, and that i was thinking of either mexico or hawaii.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{tess never said anything about it. three messages she's sent me since...and she's never once mentioned the vacation.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{im sure she can't wait, sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's not the pointerior this is someone who lives for vacations and travelling. i thought she'd jump at the chance for us to go away with eve, of course we'd take eve.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{perhaps tess didn't receive the message?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(as if anticipating gerty's comment)}
<D>__{but this isn't the only time it's happened, gerty. when i asked her how her dad was doing on his new heart medicine she didn't respond to that i asked her when eve was going to start nursery nothing. had her brother got the position at the university? nothing. nothing.}
<A>__{sam is really having a go at the stress ball now.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{i think her brother did get the position at the university. his name is christopher, correct?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he did?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{yes, i seem to recall he got the position. professor of biochemistry, i think. at syracuse university in new york?}
<A>__{sam is slightly alarmed that gerty knows this and he doesn't.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{you told me. some time ago now. towards the beginning of your time on selene. when we were starting to get to know each other.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you were very happy for your brother in law. you danced around the rec room, if i remember correctly.}
<A>__{sam looks perturbed. for a few seconds he'd eased up on the stress ball. he starts up on it again now.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing lunar sat?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{no sam. from what i understand it's fairly low on the companies priority list with the jupiter mission active. i would imagine it would be very expensive to fix.}
<A>__{a pause. sam still looks troubled.}
<C>__{gerty }
<D>__{sam, are you ok?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{they need to sort that out. seriously. i've only got two weeks left. it's not fair on whoever's up here nexterior gerty, you tell them to sort it out. it's not healthy.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{i will sam. do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{nah. come on. let's finish this.}
<A>__{gerty resumes cutting sam's hair, and stops again, sensing sam is going to say something more. the scissors freeze.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i've got another one of those headaches. can you get me something for it?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{of course. now?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no not now, afterwards.}
<A>__{the scissors start up again.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{thanks, pal.}
