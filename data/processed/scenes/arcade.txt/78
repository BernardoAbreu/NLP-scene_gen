<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the words "level two deadlands"}
<L>__{exterior level two, salt flats day}
<A>__{alex and nick are cruising along salt flats. sporadic pools of water and strange roaring sounds in the mist. so far so good. nick glances at his wrist display. his "strength" only has a few blocks left.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hey, my strength's low. look out for fireflies.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{there...}
<A>__{she points north. a small ball of light is streaking across the sky, just above the watery plains. alex and nick swerve towards it, gaining ground. as they near it, nick swings out his hand, scooping the firefly up. as soon as he touches it, it bursts like a bubble.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{shit...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{check your read out.}
<A>__{nick does. his "strength" is back to normal again.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you're right. it worked.}
<A>__{nick and alex slow their boards to a stop, stepping off them.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{there's another...}
<A>__{she sweeps left and scoops the second firefly out of the sky. off in the distance we can hear that ringing again, just at the edge of our vision. alex and nick don't hear it yet. nick is glancing down at his schematic of level two.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{according to this, the doorway should be somewhere around here...}
<B>__{their p.o.v.}
<A>__{the salt flats have gradually diminished, replaced by more and more water. ahead of them, there's no longer anything solid to stand on...just water, muck, and strange reeds poking through the mist. alex's wrist display begins to beep. she glances down.}
<B>__{wrist display}
<A>__{only one block of time remains and it's pulsing on and off. the ringing is a little louder now.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{our time's up.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what?! there's nothing here!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{look around...}
<A>__{the two of them stumble through the water, not even sure of what they're looking for.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(starting to panic)}
<D>__{i don't see the doorway!}
<A>__{alex and nick's wrist displays are beeping like crazy now. the beeps come closer and closer until they meld into one piercing high pitched tone. just then, the ringing turns into the shriek sonic boom of the screamer. a burst of light on the horizon shatters the sky.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what the fuck is that?!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{screamer.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{plunges into the marsh like water, waist high, and it's then that she sees a glow emanating from beneath the water. she dives forward...}
<B>__{beneath the surface of the brackish water}
<A>__{alex swims towards the glow. ahead of her, the depths drop off sharply, perhaps some hundred feet or so.}
<B>__{her p.o.v.}
<A>__{she can just make out a doorway...down, down, down...}
<B>__{the surface}
<A>__{alex bursts up from the water, gulping in breaths of air. nick is nearby.}
<B>__{the world}
<A>__{is beginning is vibrate now, heralding the screamer. the shriek is unbearable.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{nick! it's beneath the water! we have to swim!}
<A>__{nick stumbles in up to his neck. he can see the glow now too.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{we can't reach that!}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(over the noise)}
<D>__{we don't have a choice!}
<A>__{alex dives beneath the surface again. nick glances back towards the horizon and gets one fleeting glimpse of...}
<B>__{the screamer}
<A>__{a nightmare creation rocketing in from the east... that's it for nick. he dives, terrified. underwater, nick follows alex into the shadowy depths. he swims madly, but the glow seems impossibly far away. even under water, the apocalyptic sound of the screamer can be heard.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{peddles his arms and legs furiously. down, down, down... he knows that they'll never have enough air to make it back to the surface.}
<B>__{the glow}
<A>__{is more clearly distinguished now. it's a doorway. and set in its side is a golden key. alex reaches it. she grabs the key and turns to see how far behind nick is...}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{doubles his efforts, but his lungs are straining...}
<B>__{the screamer}
<A>__{has plunged into the water above, shooting towards nick like a torpedo, a swirling jet stream of bubbles trailing around it. nick panics, and what little air he has left escapes him. alex is reaching for nick... nick is blacking out, one last lunge at the doorway... the screamer is there now. no time. the words "level three the blue desert" flash across the screen and we...}
