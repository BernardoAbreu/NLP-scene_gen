<D>__{you'll have to sell your speeder.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{that's okay. i'm never coming back to this planet again.}
<L>__{interior mos eisley cantina}
<A>__{as han is about to leave, greedo, a slimy green faced alien with a short trunk nose, pokes a gun in his side. the creature speaks in a foreign tongue translated into english subtitles.}
<C>__{greedo}
<D>__{going somewhere, solo?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{yes, greedo. as a matter of fact, i was just going to see your boss. tell jabba that i've got his money.}
<A>__{han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the gun on him.}
<C>__{greedo}
<D>__{it's too late. you should have paid him when you had the chance. jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. i'm lucky i found you first.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{yeah, but this time i got the money.}
<C>__{greedo}
<D>__{if you give it to me, i might forget i found you.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i don't have it with me. tell jabba...}
<C>__{greedo}
<D>__{jabba's through with you. he has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{even i get boarded sometimes. do you think i had a choice?}
<A>__{han solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.}
<C>__{greedo}
<D>__{you can tell that to jabba. he may only take your ship.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{over my dead body.}
<C>__{greedo}
<D>__{that's the idea. i've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{yes, i will bet you have.}
<A>__{suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of light. han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as the other patron look on in bemused amazement. han gets up and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some coins as he leaves.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{sorry about the mess.}
