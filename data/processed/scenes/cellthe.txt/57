<L>__{interior stargher's world lighted room}
<A>__{a mottled horse stands with its head down, nose kissing the floor, allowing the boy to caress its neck. this sweet animal is an incrongruous vision in this hellish world and catherine approaches with respect.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{the frightened child retreats into a corner of the claustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle. surprisingly to the boy the horse takes an affectionate step toward catherine, inviting her to take over. catherine allows the mare to smell her, then vigorously scratches along the mane and shoulder, much to the horse's delight.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{yeah, you like that, don't you?}
<A>__{she can see the boy hiding in the corner, stealing glances at her from the shadows.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{is your name carl?}
<A>__{the boy young stargher is startled and intrigued by the question how did she know that?! but says nothing.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{another little boy i know, he has a horse, too.}
<A>__{the boy reacts to an unusual sound coming from the ceiling.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{his name's edward. the boy, not the horse...}
<A>__{the boy takes a few steps toward her, out of the shadows, but he seems more concerned about something in the ceiling than "connecting" with catherine. very anxiously, he looks at the wall behind catherine and watches an old wind up kitchen timer click down.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{what's the matter, carl?}
<A>__{again, a sharp sound from the ceiling.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{what's wro ?}
<A>__{young stargher runs at her and shoves her hard! catherine falls back just as eight sheets of glass drop from the ceiling! like oversize razor blades, they slice the horse into four clean sections. they separate and compact the quadrants until four glass contained sections of dissected horse stand within the room. catherine screams, but the mare barely acknowledged what happened. betraying no emotion, the boy runs. the shaken catherine takes a moment to collect herself, then gives chase.}
