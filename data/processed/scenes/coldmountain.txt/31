<L>__{exterior chapel, cold mountain town. day}
<A>__{those left in the congregation now spill out into what has become a melee as the news of secession goes up. enormous excitement, particularly among the boys, who now seem curiously attractive to the girls. inman blinks out into the sun, ada finds him. they're awkward as they watch other sweethearts embracing.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{well, you have your war.}
<A>__{teague and his men come riding up the street, their horses clearing a path amongst the celebrating crowd. teague reins in his horse and rides it up against esco swanger.}
<C>__{teague}
<D>__{those who follow lincoln, or preach abolition, best keep one eye open when they're sleeping, old bogey man might get you!}
<A>__{inman steps between esco and teague, holding the reins of teague's horse, easy and dangerous.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{are you the law all of a sudden?}
<A>__{teague produces a document, which he waves in the air.}
<C>__{teague}
<D>__{that's right, son. home guard for haywood county. i'm the law from today. you all go fight now. we'll watch your sweethearts.}
<A>__{and he spurs on his horse, his fellow home guard falling in behind, riding on over the ridge. inman walks to ada.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{you might be safer back in charleston.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{but then who'll be waiting for you?}
<A>__{she puts a hand on his arm for a second. they both want to get to the point of declaration but don't know how. they stand, people noisy around them, those about to leave, those about to be left.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i'm going to walk back inside the chapel.}
<A>__{and he does so, making his meaning clear for her to follow.}
