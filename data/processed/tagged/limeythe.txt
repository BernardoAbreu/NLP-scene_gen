<A>__{wilson steps out into the late sunlight and the heat of the day. a slow motion moment while he gets acclimatized. he wouldn't have ever felt quite this kind of heat before. after such a rigorously air conditioned interior. or seen cops wearing guns on their belts. or black cops, for that matter, with guns on their belts. or seen people as fat as americans on their home turf. things someone from england notices immediately, whether consciously at first or not.}

<A>__{he draws a curtain open across a window in one strong easy glide. his moves are neat. his expressions just as economical, not giving much away. outside the planes are practically on top of us. the sunset colors strange and chemical. he's only got one light bag. unzips, unpacks a few things. change of clothes, a travel kit, and some familiar items (shaving foam toothpaste deodorant} bearing unfamiliar british brand names. goes into the bathroom. turns on the shower in there. comes back to sit on the bed. takes an envelope out of his jacket.}

<L>__{exterior the building.}
<A>__{wilson crosses over to it now. from sunny to shade. walks past the chain link fence. the padlocked gate, big enough to accommodate the (couple of) trucks parked within the compound. walks past the closed security door which would appear to be the building's main entrance. round the next corner sees there's a steel back door as well. comes around this block again. looking surreptitiously around now. streets here utterly deserted. not even a passing car. crappy residential building on an opposite corner, spanish music blaring from one of the open windows, but not with a direct view on the loading yard fence on this side. wilson nearing it now taking something out of his pocket. one of the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit. snaps his wrist, unfolding the tool with a crack. wire cutters. he doesn't go for the gate, the padlock, like we might have thought. he suddenly drops to one knee, in shadow where the fence meets the adjoining building. snap, snap, snap, snap, snap so quick, with great dexterity, though his face grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each application of pressure he cuts just as many links as he knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll under. whole thing accomplished in seconds.}

<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{adhara}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{because }
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{because i'm taking care of it.}
<C>__{adhara}

<C>__{adhara}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{mr. avery.}
<A>__{avery looks to tom, who nods toward the back porch.}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{a silhouetted figure is tentatively making its way along the porch, trying not to be seen. we don't get a very clear glimpse.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{draws his gun and takes aim.}
<B>__{the figure}
<A>__{careful not to become fully visible, but growing more courageous with each step.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{locked on him, waiting.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{puts adhara's hand to her ears.}
<B>__{the figure}
<A>__{we see a little more now than we have before.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{he sees enough. squeezes off a series of shots, the muzzle flash strobing the kitchen area like a flashbulb, adhara and valentine flinching.}
<B>__{the figure}
<A>__{hit. spinning and collapsing to the ground.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{lowers his gun. turns to tom.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{watch my back.}
<A>__{avery moves out from behind the counter and heads for the body.}
<L>__{exterior big sur house. back porch. night.}
<A>__{avery makes his way to the figure, which is on its stomach and writhing slightly.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{careful. takes the gun and turns the body over.}
<B>__{stacy}
<A>__{stares up at him, choking on his last few breaths.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{puzzled. what the hell is this guy doing here? he starts feeling around stacy's jacket for anything useful, but is interrupted when his hand explodes, accompanied by the sound of a gunshot. he screams in pain.}
<L>__{interior big sur house. kitchen. night.}
<A>__{valentine and adhara drop to the floor. tom, gun raised and pointing, tries to see who shot avery.}
<L>__{exterior big sur house. back porch. night.}
<A>__{avery is turning toward his assailant, but not fast enough. a shot rings out and part of his neck disappears in a blossom of blood. stunned, he falls on his side, gasping. avery's pov uncle john. close by, huddled by the lip of the cliff. he starts to move cautiously toward avery and stacy.}
<L>__{interior big sur house. kitchen. night.}
<A>__{tom squints, trying to see.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{fuck.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{avery's down.}
<A>__{tom's pov a piece of uncle john's silhouette appears.}
<B>__{tom}
<A>__{fires at it. didn't hit anything.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{fuck this.}
<A>__{tom jumps up and runs for the living room, firing his gun in front of him toward where he last saw uncle john's silhouette.}
<B>__{living area}
<A>__{tom runs through and reaches the sliding doors to the back porch. a portion of the frame splinters from a gun shot as he gains access to the other side of the back porch.}
<L>__{exterior big sur house. back porch. night.}
<A>__{tom is through the sliding doors and trying to make his way around to the driveway.}
<B>__{uncle john}
<A>__{crouched behind the opposite end of the porch, sticks his head up.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{tom crossing to the steps, slips on the damp wood, tries to right himself.}
<B>__{uncle john}
<A>__{squeezes off two shots.}
<B>__{tom}
<A>__{is shot in the ankle as he is about to reach the steps. he yelps in pain, tries to raise his gun.}
<B>__{uncle john}
<A>__{crouched down. a shot flies over his head.}
<B>__{tom}
<A>__{stops shooting. tries dragging his shattered ankle to the steps.}
<B>__{uncle john}
<A>__{looks over the edge of the porch.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{tom turning toward the steps.}
<B>__{uncle john}
<A>__{fires at him.}
<B>__{tom}
<A>__{screams again as his elbow of his gun hand disintegrates. he slips on the first step and tumbles down, the gun bouncing beside him.}
<B>__{uncle john}
<A>__{sees this. stands up to cross the back porch. takes a step forward but is stopped by a bullet in the chest (about the only clean shot anybody makes). he looks down at himself.}
<C>__{uncle john}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{he looks up to see:}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{near death. gun in his good hand. he squeezes the trigger again.}
<B>__{uncle john}
<A>__{a small black hole appears in his cheek. he blinks, begins to raise his hand to his face, and collapses.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{exhales and rolls over.}
<B>__{tom}
<A>__{still trying to get to his feet. he gives up and just lies there, panting.}
<B>__{a hand}
<A>__{reaches for the gun beside tom. tilt up with it to reveal:}
<B>__{ed}
<A>__{he puts the gun in his jacket and slides away.}
<L>__{interior big sur house. kitchen. night.}
<A>__{valentine and adhara are still stuck behind the counter. valentine sees the shadowy shape of ed slipping behind the back porch.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{decides to make a run for it, following tom's route, away from ed.}
<C>__{adhara}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<B>__{living room}
<A>__{valentine runs to the sliding door, smack into:}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{standing there. wet. mad. he grabs valentine by the shirt and pushes him back into the room.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{bounces off the couch and onto the floor.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{comes toward him.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{grabs a lamp off an end table and hurls it at wilson. it careens off wilson's arm and shatters.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{is almost on him now.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{tries to scramble away. throwing anything he can get his hands on at.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{who keeps coming. he grabs valentine, pulls him up, then throws him into the television.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{crashes into the tv face first and bounces to the floor.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{goes to him, grabs him by the neck with one hand and pulls out his gun with the other. he seems about to speak when suddenly he screams instead.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{aaaagggghhhh!}
<B>__{adhara}
<A>__{has just stuck a kitchen knife into wilson's back.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{turns instinctively and whips the pistol around, smashing adhara in the mouth.}
<B>__{adhara}
<A>__{hits the ground. she won't be retaliating.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{in agony, spinning, trying to reach the knife in his back, but it's just beyond his reach.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{scrambles through the sliding glass door.}
<L>__{exterior big sur house. back porch. night.}
<A>__{valentine stumbles out. notices avery slumped on the deck, mortally wounded. goes to him as if concerned but actually just to take the gun. then runs off the porch toward the steps that lead down to the sea.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{comes out after him, the knife still in his back. so intent on catching valentine he fails at first to notice avery lying in the shadows.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{has just barely managed to reach stacy's pistol. raises it weakly. points it at wilson.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{seems to feel it. turns. locks eyes with avery. avery could already have shot him. but there's a momentary sense of recognition: both of them just foot soldiers for fat cats and avery's is not worth saving.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{lowers the gun. nods in the direction valentine went.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{... that way ...}
<A>__{wilson moves on. avery just lies there, presumably to die.}
<L>__{exterior big sur house. steps. night.}
<A>__{valentine hurries down the rickety steps. trying not to slip in the darkness, though there are tiny malibu lights illuminating the steep and winding wooden framework.}
<L>__{exterior beach. night.}
<A>__{a rocky cove. valentine looks back up the way he came, hearing the footsteps coming down after him. backs away a few paces on the slippery rocks. falls. lands on the crumpled, dead body of larry, the bodyguard, who was thrown off the cliff. valentine recoils. when wilson appears, valentine fires at him. a wild shot that only makes wilson duck momentarily. valentine scrambles to his feet, runs on.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{jumps down from the steps. stops for a moment and leans his back against the railing. bends at the knees slightly.}
<B>__{the knife}
<A>__{the handle is forced upward just enough to be reachable now.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{grimacing, pulls the knife out and discards it.}
<B>__{further down the beach}
<A>__{valentine runs. or tries to. it's dark and the ground is treacherous. the beach runs out pretty soon. now just rocks. maybe he thought he could get around the rocks on the point at the other end. but he can't see very far ahead. and the tide is in, water making any escape extremely difficult. he tries to scramble over some rocks. they're wet, slippery. he falls, cries out as he literally breaks an ankle.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{a dark figure. coming into focus. walking inexorably this way.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{painfully rights himself. a small bone protrudes from his broken ankle. he fires at wilson, gun in one hand, other hand gripping his wrist to try and steady it. doing his best to aim. but the shots miss their mark.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{steadily coming.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{out of bullets now. gun clicking crazily on empty. he simply drops it.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{now stands before him.}
<B>__{the two of them}
<A>__{both breathing hard.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{tell me.}
<A>__{this is not what valentine expected.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{what.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{tell you ...}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{about jenny.}
<P>__{(closer)}
<D>__{tell me about jenny.}
<P>__{(closer)}
<D>__{about the deal . whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.}
<A>__{wilson drops to the ground too, in a passionate fury, starts strangling valentine.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{tell me. tell me about it, you fucking bastard.}
<A>__{easing up just enough for valentine to sputter out a response.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{she could've had the deal! i would've handed it to her if she wanted. i would have given her everything. wilson why then. why did you do it!}
<A>__{they're locked in a kind of embrace. sprayed by the waves crashing into the rocks. sweating and gasping and exhausted and hurt and furious.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{she didn't want to share it, she wanted to stop it. to stop me. she said she'd turn me in .}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{shock of recognition on his face. at those words.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{she said, "you go ahead with this, i will turn you in, terry."}
<A>__{wilson sits back. panting. totally spent. the two of them. both on the ground now. whatever energy they had left drained valentine from his confession, wilson from hearing it. valentine shaking, sobbing. still not realizing the pathetic folly of his actions.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{she was serious. she would have done it. she had the phone in her hand. she was going to do it.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{knows that the girl he loved ... loved valentine, too. having heard the truth, the last vestige of revenge has vanished. he gets up and walks away. leaving the quivering shell of valentine behind.}
<T>__{cut:}
<L>__{interior big sur house. living room. night.}
<A>__{adhara wakes up. hand to her smashed cheek and mouth. but it's not her hand. it's valentine's. she sort of shuffles away from him along the floor. sits against a wall holding her face. valentine sits back against an opposite wall. they stare at each other.}
<T>__{cut:}
<L>__{interior plane. day.}
<A>__{wilson, lost in thought. accepts a drink from a flight attendant. we can see it pains him to reach for it.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{ta.}
<A>__{after setting the glass down, his other hand goes to the shoulder where his stab wound was no doubt only temporarily dealt with.}
<T>__{flash cuts:}
<A>__{wilson. at the roadside hotel, grimacing. elaine. cleaning his wound. wilson rubs his shoulder. the american lady in the seat beside him heard the way he said thanks to the flight attendant.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{you're english.}
<A>__{a small beat (which he takes each time he responds).}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{yeah, that's right.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{i can never decide what i like better. leaving home, or coming back.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{takes this in.}
<T>__{flash cuts:}
<A>__{wilson. shaving in the mirror at his l.a. motel. he stops. wilson. in the car leaving valentine's house. fingering the picture of jenny.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{i would have preferred staying home, me.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{you're a reluctant traveller, then.}
<A>__{wilson nods.}
<T>__{flash cuts:}
<A>__{wilson. in the car with elaine and ed, driving back from big sur. everyone in their own world. wilson. at ed's house. saying goodbye. wilson and ed. shake hands. ed. watching him get into elaine's car.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{got called out to l.a., unexpected like, to do a job of work.}
<T>__{flash cuts:}
<A>__{wilson. at the airport, staring at elaine. elaine. staring back. wilson and elaine. she embraces him. elaine. she watches him leave. wilson. disappearing into the terminal.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{you'll be looking forward to getting back, then.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{yeah. another little matter needs attending to soon as i return.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{no rest for the wicked.}
<A>__{wilson nods, exhales.}
<T>__{flash cut:}
<A>__{wilson. in the cab on the way to ed's, at the beginning of the film. watching the lights go by.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{been away a lot.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{where else?}
<A>__{longer beat. he actually turns to look at her now. takes her in, then looks forward again.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{out on a oil rig. in the north sea. nine years.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{nine years?}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{is that legal?}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{well, time off for good behavior, you know. i shouldn't have even been there it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place. i got lumbered with the job they were responsible for. i don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what i mean.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{but you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{i had to, didn't i. nothing else for it. then just when i'd finished my nine years my contract wallop, i had to bugger off to the states.}
<C>__{lady}
<P>__{(reacting slightly to his "colorful" language)}
<D>__{sounds like you need a rest.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{could do, yeah.}
<A>__{another beat.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{but first i gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{the ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{and he turns away, to the window. looks at the blue sky. sips his drink. then, hard:}
