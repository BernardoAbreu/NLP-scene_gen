<L>__{interior monza grand prix press conference day}
<A>__{a packed press conference. the world's media. niki's accident and recovery (as a story) has reached way beyond f1 race fans. this is front page news around the globe.. niki walks out onto the podium all eyes staring at him the sense of a ghoulish, voyeuristic freak show.... niki sits on the podium, in front of microphones, flanked on both sides by ferrari drivers and top brass. but no one wants to talk to them. everyone's here to talk to niki..}
<C>__{japanese journalist}
<D>__{how are you feeling, niki?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{american journalist}
<D>__{can you confirm for us exactly which procedures you have had? and the expectations for your recovery?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{sure. i had a skin graft operation where they put half my right thigh in my face. it doesn't look too good but one unexpected advantage is it's impossible to perspire through a skin graft, so sweat will never run in my eyes again which is good for a driver.}
<A>__{laughter. at the back of the hall, james hunt creeps in, (unseen by anyone, disguised in a hat), to listen.}
<C>__{brazilian journalist}
<D>__{when they heard about your condition, ferrari immediately hired another driver, carlos reutemann.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{ja. before even my first operation.}
<C>__{japanese journalist}
<D>__{is he your replacement now?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{no. just another team mate. keen to make an impression. so let's see where mr. reutemann finishes today.}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{japanese journalist}
<D>__{james hunt and mclaren have caught up a lot while you were away.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{is there a question now? or are you just trying to piss me off?}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{japanese journalist}
<D>__{you think you can still win?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{of course. i have the better car. i'm the better driver. but he's a clever guy and has used the time well while i was lying half dead in hospital to win some points..}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{british journalist}
<D>__{what did your wife say when she saw your face?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{she said, "sweetie, you don't need a face to drive. only a right foot."}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{british journalist}
<D>__{i'm being serious. do you really think your marriage can survive? with the way you look now?}
<A>__{silence. niki squints into the lights..}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{and i'm being serious, too. which asshole said this? jesus..}
<A>__{no one moves. niki, disgusted, rips off his microphone..}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{fuck you. press conference over.}
<A>__{niki walks out. the press conference breaks up... james sees the reporter who asked the question, laughing with his friends. james watches as the reporter leaves...}
