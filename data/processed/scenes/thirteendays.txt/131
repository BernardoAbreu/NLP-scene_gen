<D>__{get that fuel assayed?}
<C>__{wilhemy}
<D>__{yeah. it sucks. ain't for high performance babies like ours. shoulda brought some from home, but what can you do? last second deployments...}
<A>__{wilhemy jumps off, then they're at ecker's plane, and he jumps off. too late to worry about bad fuel now. he hoists himself up and into the cockpit of the sleek navy jet.}
<D>__{interior ecker's crusader day}
<A>__{as the canopy closes, ecker powers up the engines, talks to his flight over the guard channel.}
<C>__{ecker}
<D>__{okay, time to play spin the bottle with our bearded buddy. nobody gets out ahead. remember, just sitting here we're only ten minutes from target.}
