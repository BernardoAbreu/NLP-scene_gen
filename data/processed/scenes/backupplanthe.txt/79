<A>__{zoe and nana are walking the loop around the courtyard. zoe looks terrible. like she hasn't slept in days. they complete a lap. arthur gives them the double thumbs up sign.}
<C>__{nana}
<D>__{that man is obsessed with my ass.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i know. it's kind of upsetting.}
<C>__{nana}
<D>__{he wants to take me on a cruise so that we can finally tie the knot. but, i don't know. what's the hurry?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{you've been engaged for nine years.}
<C>__{nana}
<D>__{no reason to rush into anything.}
<A>__{nana looks over at zoe. she sees the bags under her eyes.}
<C>__{nana }
<D>__{you look terrible, dear.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{nana}
<D>__{you must really love him, huh?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i guess i do.}
<C>__{nana}
<D>__{honey, i'm sure he's wonderful, and i'm sure he loves you, too. but, you have put him in a really awkward position. having a baby is a big adjustment for any couple. and you're not married. and he's not the father. and you've only been together a little while. and now you're having twins. and }
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{please stop.}
<C>__{nana}
<D>__{i'm just saying, if he actually wanted to stay with you right now, he'd be the greatest man in the world, and, quite frankly, i don't think any man is that great.}
<A>__{they complete another lap around the courtyard. arthur smiles at them and then "raises the roof."}
<C>__{nana }
<D>__{arthur's just about the best man i know, and look at him. he's a fucking idiot.}
