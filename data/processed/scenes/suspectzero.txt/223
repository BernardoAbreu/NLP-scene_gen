<A>__{she half smiles. she likes him, despite herself. diner mackelway resuming he half smiles, puts the cel phone away. he likes her, despite himself. then a man passes by him, a trucker. let's call him vic. all we see as he passes is the tattoo on his forearm: a cobra. keys jingle on his belt hook. he wears a sleeveless down vest and a "god bless america" cap. mackelway turns, but vic's already past us. something about him attracts mackelway's attention. the walk, the attitude. something. so mackelway is watching without really knowing why as vic crosses the parking lot, heading for his rig. it's a beast. vic climbs in, unaware that he's being watched. mackelway looks away, chiding himself for allowing the guy to distract him. that waitress comes by with more coffee. mackelway smiles, looking absently out the window again. and sees a little boy of 5, in the cab of vic's rig... but this little boy is screaming, struggling to get out of his car seat, until vic grabs the kid by the shoulders, roughly... all of this visible through the windshield. mackelway locks in on the kid. holy shit... vic's rig pulls out. the kid pounds on his window. looks like he's saying "lemme out of here! i want my mommy!" he might be little charlie we can't tell from here. but we can see that vic is yelling at him: "shut up!" and we can see that vic's truck is refrigerated. he's hauling dairy products. on a normal day, mackelway might shrug this off as coincidence. he might not be so vigilant. this isn't a normal day. he races for the door.}
