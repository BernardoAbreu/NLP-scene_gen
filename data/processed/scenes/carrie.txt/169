<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior white house day}
<A>__{as tommy's volkswagen parks across the street, tommy gets out and approaches the white house. carrie is inside, watching him come up the stairs. she remains on the hall side of the screen door.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{so this is where you live.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{what... what're you doing here?}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{aren't you going to ask me in?}
<A>__{she shakes her head; he laughs again, a little nervously. throughout this scene in which he remains on the porch side of the screen door, he catches glimpses of the weird house within.}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{momma's resting. what do you want?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{right to the point, huh? okay, about the prom.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i already told you.}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(a little charm)}
<D>__{nothing to stop you changing your mind. girls do it all the time.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{hey, i'm asking you because i want to.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{look, i don't do anything i don't want to.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{sure you can.}
<A>__{in the background in the kitchen, perhaps margaret calls out carrie's name. carrie glances nervously behind her; then back at tommy.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{you better go.}
<C>__{margaret's voice}
<D>__{carrie! who are you talking to?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{don't you think you better answer?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no one, momma.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you're going with me.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you're going.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{they'll laugh.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{no one will laugh. we'll see to it.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{please. please go.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{not `til you say yes.}
<A>__{carrie swipes at her eyes with the back of her hand; helpless, honest, confused. she'd really like to go at this point, but that extra sense in her is resisting.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{why? why is it so important to you?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe it's because you liked my poem.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{carietta!!!}
<A>__{and in just these split seconds, she decides; had he not "liked" her poem, had margaret not called, perhaps she could have held back.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i will pick you up at eight.}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{fine.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{tommy smiles at her and, turning to leave, touches her hand against the screen door. a goodbye, nothing more. he goes down the walk toward his car.}
