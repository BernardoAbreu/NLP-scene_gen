<A>__{at the base of the hills, mayapore village does nothing to re lieve the awful sense of devastation. a desolate road runs through the village, along which groups of ptiifully poor vil lagers stare at the strangers being brought in. hopeless women lift buckets from a dry well finding only sand. skinny miserable dogs skulk between the decrepit village huts, eyed by the patient vultures lurling in scraggly trees. indiana notices the wretched peasants staring at short round, some of them pointing at him, a few haggard women shedding tears down their wrinkled faces as the little chinese boy passes. there is no sign of children in the village and short round grows frightened by the odd attention. he moves closer to indy as they pass the devastated population.}
