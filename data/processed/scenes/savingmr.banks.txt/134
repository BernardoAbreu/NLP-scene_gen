<L>__{interior travers' bedroom day}
<A>__{ginty stands in the bedroom, a long way from the bed. she stands there, it seems, for an eternity. then, finally, step by step she draws closer. the empty bottle on the floor. the sheets twisted, still wet with sweat, flecked and spotted with blood. the front of her father's nightdress is also bloodstained. ginty's eyes reach his face. travers lies, eyes open, mouth open, teeth slightly red stained, neither peaceful nor distressed. just nothing.}
