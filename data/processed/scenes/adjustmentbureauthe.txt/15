<L>__{interior empty banquet room night}
<A>__{david stands alone looking out at the empty room. trying to get used to it. it's not easy.}
<L>__{interior men's room night}
<A>__{david enters the huge, ornate, men's room and goes to the row of sinks. he pulls two ricola cherry lozenges from his pocket. he twirls them in his hands for a moment. then tosses them into the trash can. he looks at himself in the mirror, fighting to hold himself together. a sound behind him. david spins to see a woman exiting one of the stalls. she's in a stunning ball gown and carrying an expensive bottle of champagne.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{hi. i hope i didn't startle you.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what are you doing in here?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{hiding from security.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh... what did you do?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{crashed a wedding. one floor up.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's almost midnight. they just caught on now?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{ivana trump finally realized i wasn't her niece. i think after the fifth glass of champagne my czech accent started slipping.}
<A>__{in spite of david's state that gets a grin.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{are you for real?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{life is short.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hard to argue with that.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you're that guy running for senate aren't you?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm "that guy."}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you winning?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{too bad. the other guy's a tool.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{maybe i should have made that clearer in my ads.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{personally, i think mooning your friends at a college reunion is no big deal.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i don't think the post should have printed the photo.}
<A>__{david just shakes his head. he will never, ever live that down and he knows it.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{at least not full page.}
<A>__{he can't help but crack up.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{listen, i've done it.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you weren't running, for senate at the time.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{do you still have a chance or is it over?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{he crushed me.}
<A>__{she has beautiful eyes. and an exceptional gift for conveying empathy...}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you must ...i don't know what you must be feeling...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{winning would feel better. but losing has its advantages.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the only time a politician is alone is when he's asleep.. .or in the bathroom. after eight years in politics that gets kind of hard to take.}
<A>__{she tilts her head a little, gives him a curious look.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{watching you, you'd never know it.}
<A>__{the way she looks at him, the way she says it, david knows she sees what others miss in him even if he isn't even quite sure what it is. not yet.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{thank you...}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{well, everything happens for a reason, right? even losing. god, i'm really rolling out the platitudes tonight, aren't i?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's the champagne. brines out the hallmark in people.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{after it kills their czech accents.}
<A>__{she offers him the bottle. he hesitates, then takes it.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why not? i have to think up some good platitudes for my speech.}
<A>__{he takes a gulp of champagne.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{why the hell would you do that?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{apparently, even if i hadn't been caught dropping my drawers in the middle of a senate campaign i would have lost the election anyway because i'm too blunt.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(swig of champagne)}
<D>__{says who?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the tv pundits.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{fuck 'em. they just wish they had the balls to be candidates themselves.}
<A>__{she hands him the champagne bottle again.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{and they work for the man anyway.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you going to run again?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(drinks)}
<D>__{tonight's probably not the night to ask.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(finger pointing)}
<D>__{no, it is. look at me. you have to run again. do yo hear me?}
<A>__{she's serious about this. intense.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{otherwise the country will be run by tools. like lynwood.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{"field."}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{"lynfield."}
<A>__{a beat. she shrugs. then they lean toward each other... and kiss. it turns more and more passionate. when they finally pull apart:}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<A>__{she seems just as surprised. they look at each other and laugh. just then the bathroom door opens. it's charlie. he sees david and the woman.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{david?}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(suddenly embarrassed)}
