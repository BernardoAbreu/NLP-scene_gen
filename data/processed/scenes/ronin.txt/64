<L>__{interior the landing outside same time}
<A>__{this is a small building. there is no other apartment on the floor. at the far end of the landing, there is a small ladder which leads up to the roof. and the door which leads to the roof is flapping in a light wind.}
<L>__{exterior the roof same time}
<A>__{vincent bursts onto the roof, gun straight out, finger on the trigger, only to find sam is there, his gun pointed at vincent. a beat, then both men give little laughs and put their weapons away, like samurai so trained in combat that they know when it's safe to relax.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you weren't around when i woke up, i thought maybe something had happened.}
<P>__{(off sam's look)}
<D>__{this has been one very fucked up job, sam, and i'm not taking any more chances on anybody...}
<P>__{(a quick beat)}
<D>__{including you...}
<A>__{in answer sam takes out vincent's pack of cigarettes and tosses them back to him. vincent looks almost delighted at this.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i came up here to sneak a smoke.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you were smoking?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i hope you don't mind i took your pack. it was on the table.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(very sincere, offering the pack)}
<D>__{please, help yourself. smoke as many you'd like.}
<A>__{sam considers for a minute, and then takes one. vincent does so as well, and he searches for his lighter, which he can't seem to find, because sam has it, and he lights their cigarettes, and then hands the lighter back to vincent.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(a shrug of the shoulders)}
<D>__{i borrowed that, too...}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(puffing contentedly)}
<D>__{of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i have a feeling i'm about to start buying my own.}
<A>__{beat. the two men smoke in silence, looking out at the curved shoreline of nice which glitters with thousands of lights from the apartment buildings, and a thousand more from the cars that travel on the road that leads into town: the promenade des anglais.}
<C>__{vincent }
<D>__{that was a bad bit of business, today.}
<A>__{back on sam and vincent.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it was at that.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{a lot of people died.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i've seen a lot of people die before.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i haven't. not like that. how do you get used to it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you don't. you just learn to live with it.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i won't lie there have been times when i had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we live in a singular world, my friend.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i never really thought i was part of the world you move in, sam, to tell you the truth.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{i'm a hood, a thief. big time in a small time king of way. to the local police i'm a prize, to the local hoods i'm a legend. but to a guy like you i'm just another two bit hired gun.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you might be a hired gun, vincent, but i got a feeling you cost more than two bits.}
<A>__{this conversation might have gone further, but it is interrupted when deirdre pokes her head up onto the roof.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{christ, i was starting to think that the two of you had thrown it in and walked away.}
<P>__{(to vincent)}
<D>__{there's someone on the phone downstairs asking for you, and my somewhat limited french leads me to believe that he might have something to tell us about gregor.}
