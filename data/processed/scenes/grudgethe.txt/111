<L>__{97 interior morgue day}
<A>__{the coroner sits on a stool, staring at the floor. two bodies lie under bloody white sheets on two steel tables. between them is a small cart a bloody cloth on top. nakagawa and igarashi enter. the coroner stands, nervous. he walks to one of the tables and pulls back the sheet.}
<C>__{nakagawa }
<D>__{have you determined a cause of death?}
<C>__{coroner }
<D>__{not yet. the blood on his body isn't his. it belongs to her.}
<A>__{he points to the other table. but doesn't look at it.}
<C>__{nakagawa }
<D>__{i don't understand. he killed yoko, before he died?}
<A>__{the coroner shakes his head. nakagawa looks to igarashi, then walks up to the second body, pulling back the sheet. it's yoko. still missing her jawbone. nakagawa and igarashi stare down at her in disbelief. the coroner walks to the small table, removing the cloth. yoko's jawbone is underneath it.}
<C>__{coroner }
<D>__{the jawbone you found in the attic yesterday with the american couple belongs to this girl. i estimate it was removed from her body two or three days ago.}
<C>__{igarashi }
<D>__{but i thought you said her body was found with this man, tonight.}
<A>__{the coroner nods. eyes on his shoes.}
<C>__{nakagawa }
<D>__{then how did she get from the house to the health center?}
<A>__{the coroner, lost in his imagination, answers quietly:}
<C>__{coroner }
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<A>__{a beat. nakagawa walks to the jawbone. stares at it.}
<C>__{nakagawa }
<D>__{she survived for two days without this?}
<C>__{coroner }
<D>__{it would seem so.}
<C>__{nakagawa }
<D>__{how is that possible?}
<A>__{the coroner looks up at him, his face pale.}
<C>__{coroner }
<D>__{i don't believe it is.}
