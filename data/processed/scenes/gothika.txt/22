<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{peter, what the hell is going on?}
<A>__{pete nods at irene: it's okay, he'll take it from here.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{how do you feel?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{how do you think i feel? is this a joke?}
<A>__{peter is half listening to her, half signaling to the nurse with the meds to come in. miranda catches all of this, growing more agitated. she wears the uniform all patients wear: a white t shirt and sweats. her wedding ring is gone.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{giving you something to calm down.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i don't need to calm down. what i need is an explanation}
<A>__{pete grabs the meds from the nurse. irene and the attendant step closer to help. miranda feels them closing in on her. peter's tone is infuriatingly gentle:}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{just take this and we can sit down and chat.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{why here, why not in my office?}
<A>__{she looks at the silent faces around her. no sympathy. or maybe too much sympathy. either way it's unnerving.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i don't want an anticonvulsant, at least give me valium.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(nods at nurse)}
<D>__{fifty milligrams.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{jesus christ, you're gonna knock me out? ten milligrams.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(final offer)}
<D>__{twenty.}
<A>__{the nurse complies. miranda stares at the meds, trying desperately to put this into some kind of perspective.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{how would you feel if you woke up in a goddamn cell, dressed like this?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{we can discuss it at length after you take your meds.}
<A>__{awkward nods from irene, the nurse and the attendant. pete holds miranda's gaze. miranda takes her meds.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{okay. this better be good.}
<A>__{pete motions for the others to leave them alone. one by one they file out and lock the door behind them.}
