<A>__{marty's bar later it is completely still. we are looking from the bar, across the dark empty floor, toward the pebbled windows at the front of the building that catch a hard blue light from the streetlamps outside. the jukebox in the middle distance glows in the darkness. a pair of headlights catches the pebbled glass and grows brighter as we hear a car pull up to the bar and stop. we hear a car door open and shut, then the sound of feet on gravel. a huge shadow appears on the pebbled glass as the figure crosses in front of the headlights. the man tries the door, finds it locked, and walks back in front of the headlights to cup his hands at a window. he walks back to the door, and a moment later it swings open framing him in the doorway in silhouette. we follow him as he moves across the floor, behind the bar and up to the cash register. he switches on a small fluorescent light clamped to the top of the cash register. it is ray. he punches a key and the register rings open. he lifts up the empty cash drawer and takes some papers from underneath it. ray's pov as he flips through the papers; bills, receipts, no money.}

<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{damn...}
<A>__{he slips them back under the cash drawer and slams the register shut. turning from the register he glances around the bar, the pauses, noticing something. ray's pov light is spilling out from under the door to marty's office.}

<D>__{marty...}
<A>__{the door is locked. we hear the muffled whir of the ceiling fan inside. a pause. ray withdraws a ring of keys from his pocket and uses one on the door. the door swings open. over his shoulder we see marty, still at his desk, his back to us. on foot is still propped on the desk.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what's the matter, you deaf?}
<A>__{no answer. ray stumbles toward marty. he stumbles slightly and we hear the sharp blast of a gun and the sound of something metallic skating across the floor. ray, startled, steadies himself against the desk, then studies marty. ray's pov there is a dark pool of blood under marty's chair.}
<B>__{back to ray}
<A>__{he looks back up at marty, then walks behind his chair and throws a wall switch. the room is bathed in light. his eyes still on marty, ray crosses behind the desk. ray's pov tracking shot the camera moves in a slow arc around the back of marty's motionless head.}
<B>__{back to ray}
<A>__{still moving. he looks away from marty, scans the floor. he gets down on his hands and knees and peers under the safe. ray's pov there is a glinting silver circle in the darkness under the safe. it is the business end of the revolver that ray half stumbled over, half kicked.}
<B>__{back to ray}
<A>__{still on his hands and knees. he reaches in and we hear a rattle as he gropes under the safe. he withdraws the gun, looks at it.}

<A>__{for a long moment he doesn't move. then, slowly, he starts to get up.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{the desk, marty behind it, ray straightening behind him. ray looks from the gun to marty, slowly sets the gun down on the desk. a pause. he begins to hoist marty from the chair. there is noise from the bar, as of someone entering. ray reacts.}
