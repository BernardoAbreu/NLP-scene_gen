<A>__{steed and emma board the bus. destination: not in service. they pay brenda, the conductor. go upstairs.}
<L>__{127 upstairs}
<A>__{is mother's temporary mobile hq. he squats in a corner. metal hooks on electronic panels. now paranoid. suspicious. all the upper windows have been blacked out.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{welcome to mobile h.q. weather's turning quite nasty. sir august was blown to smithereens. along with half of banffshire. the ministry's worried.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{he tried to warn us ...}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{we had a lead to wonderland weather but we got there too late. someone tipped them off ...}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{too late anyway. today's escapade was only for starters. this is no ordinary weather. it's manmade. a kind of weather bomb.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{impossible.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{not quite. this is my field.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{is there anything that isn't?}
<C>__{emma}
<P>__{(ignores)}
<D>__{the prospero project was started by my husband. it was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. in theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. we thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. a 'quick fix'...}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{exactly. there'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. propane gas mostly. in small quantities it captures chlorine. protects the ozone layer. but it proved impractical. too bulky ...}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{but if someone miniaturized the process...}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{that's what we were working on.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{would it be possible to use it for military purposes?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{directed by laser. bounced by satellite. quite possible.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{where would they aim for?}
<A>__{mother thinks, gets out of his wheelchair; takes a turn about the bus, sits down again. no one pays any attention.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{london. the world council of ministers meets soon on global defence. if you can control the weather, you control the world.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{after the cold war ...}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{the hot and cold war ...}
<A>__{sign "grand opening soon." widen to reveal ...}
