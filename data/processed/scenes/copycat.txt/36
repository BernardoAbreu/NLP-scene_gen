<L>__{interior police library day}
<A>__{close: an attorney in court}
<C>__{attorney}
<D>__{... it was your feeling after careful evaluation that he was a sexual sadist who satisfied at least four out of ten criteria in the dms iii?}
<A>__{show m.j. and ruben watching videotapes, and eating chinese takeout. helen is being interrogated by the attorney for daryll lee cullum. helen sure of herself to the point of arrogance, which is her undoing...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes. without question.}
<C>__{attorney}
<D>__{without question? he only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria? couldn't another expert say he flunked the sexual sadist test? what curve are you marking on, doctor?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{the test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.}
<C>__{attorney}
<D>__{only part. what else? what did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because joan of arc told him to do it.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he was lying.}
<C>__{attorney}
<D>__{'lying. he was lying.' i asked you what you thought, not what he did.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i thought he was lying.}
<C>__{attorney}
<D>__{you said, first, he was lying. how do you know that, doctor?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears. daryll lee told me that joan of arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.}
<A>__{murmur of subdued laughter in court.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(emboldened)}
<D>__{he took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong. he was not acting on mad impulse. he was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.}
<C>__{attorney}
<P>__{(playing causal)}
<D>__{what pattern was that?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{the same as the first time...}
<A>__{she catches herself. the d.a. has leapt to his feet, but now tries to sit down as though nothing was happening, but helen, the attorney and the d.a. all are clearly disturbed by the line this questioning is taking.}
<C>__{attorney}
<D>__{the first what?}
<P>__{(as she hesitates)}
<D>__{your honor, she's got this far, i think she should finish. i don't think this jury should be left wondering where the rest of her statement would lead.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i agree, doctor.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{the first two murders.}
<C>__{attorney}
<D>__{what first two murders. we don't know about them here, do we?}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(giving up)}
<D>__{he told me he had done two others just like it.}
<C>__{attorney}
<D>__{when was that?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{when he was seventeen.}
<C>__{attorney}
<D>__{and you believed him when he told you he had done that.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes. i believed him.}
<A>__{the d.a. is rushing to the bench to argue with the judge.}
<C>__{judge }
<D>__{yes, i will accept a call for a mistrial. evidence of that other crime when the defendant was a juvenile is inadmissible and never should have been heard by this jury...}
<B>__{freeze frames.}
<A>__{now we see m.j. and ruben looking at helen on the tv screen,}
<B>__{thinking... the door opens and quinn enters.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{there was no sperm.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{the same as the firs two. definitely a serial.}
<C>__{quinn}
<P>__{(seeing helen on video)}
<D>__{what are you looking at that for? helen hudson. work the clues.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{what clues? i'm going to work helen hudson.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{would you step outside, sergeant?}
<A>__{m.j. leaves a cautiously silent ruben. once the door shuts, he turns tape back to 'play.'}
