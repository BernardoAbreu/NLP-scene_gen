<A>__{juno macguff stands on a placid street in a nondescript subdivision, facing the curb. it's fall. juno is sixteen years old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. she winces and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun. the object of her rapt attention is a battered living room set, abandoned curbside by its former owners. there is a fetid looking leather recliner, a chrome edged coffee table, and a tasteless latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger.}
