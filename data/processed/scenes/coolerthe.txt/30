<L>__{interior bernie's motel room day}
<A>__{tight on bernie sleeping. he still has that goofy smile on his lips. a beat or two later, he opens his eyes. we pull back to reveal that he's alone in the bed. no sign of natalie. bernie turns to the pillow next to him, buries his face in it. takes a deep breath. moans at her scent. ambrosia. he still has his face in the pillow, sucking in deep breaths, when natalie steps out of the bathroom. big smile.}
