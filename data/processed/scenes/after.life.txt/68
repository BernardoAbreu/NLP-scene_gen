<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that's none of your business.}
<A>__{eliot shrugs. dries his hands on a white towel.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you weren't going to tell me paul was here, were you?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{because it would only hurt you. you have to let go of the living. just like they have to let go of you.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't believe you. why are you doing this to me?}
<A>__{he shakes his head as he drops the towel into a small bin.}
