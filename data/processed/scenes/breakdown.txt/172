<A>__{jeff opens the door. a weak dome light flickers on. he climbs up into the cab and tries turning on the cb radio, but no luck the keys are gone. he opens the glove compartment. there are maps, trip logs, truck stop receipts. he rifles through them quickly. jeff frowns, gets on the floor of the cab and gropes under the driver's seat. his eyes register a discovery. he brings out a big black semi automatic pistol. jeff studies the base of the grip, clearly unfamiliar with guns. he fumbles with the clip, ejects it. the clip is full of bullets. he snaps the clip back in place.}
