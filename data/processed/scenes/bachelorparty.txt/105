<L>__{interior hotel lobby a few minutes later}
<A>__{the door opens and stan and ryko enter pulling the "moose" by a rope.}
<C>__{ryko}
<D>__{can you believe how perfect it fits?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{yeah. who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.}
<A>__{just then rick and o'neill saunter into the lobby.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{hey, you guys...}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{who's your friend?}
<C>__{stan}
<P>__{(keeping it a surprise)}
<D>__{oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. we're bringing them to the party.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{great.}
<P>__{(to moose)}
<D>__{i was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?}
<A>__{at that moment he hears a splat hit the ground. the guys look down and see a large, shiny clump of shiny brown excrement nestled in the shag carpet.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{say no more.}
<A>__{the manager crosses to them.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i don't know which one of you did this, but you're not going anywhere till you clean up this disgusting mess.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{anybody got a paper towel or a shovel or something?}
<A>__{all the guests turn away in disgust. stan takes out a handkerchief and hands it to rick, who closes his eyes and picks up the warm little bundle. the manager turns and walks off in a huff. on the way back to the elevator, rick checks to see no one is watching and places the handkerchief's contents on the front desk, just out of frame. smiling contentedly, the guys lead the reluctant "moose" into the elevator. the doors slam shut.}
<B>__{angle at the desk}
<A>__{the manager is just finishing checking in a couple from out of town.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i will have the boy take your bags up.}
<A>__{he goes to hit the bell and to his surprise, his hand comes down on something soft and mushy. the look on his face tells us what it is. it's the "gift" rick left behind.}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(to couple)}
<D>__{excuse me. i seem to have a hand full of potty.}
<A>__{revolted, he races into a room marked "men." angle ballroom doors the doors open and several people from the moosehead beauty pageant come out. mr. thomerson is one of them.}
<C>__{executive}
<D>__{thanks for helping us out, ed. we appreciate it.}
<C>__{mr. thomerson}
<D>__{any time, al.}
<A>__{mr. t. crosses to the door just as cole comes running in, slightly dazed, wrapped in the tattered remnants of the sheet that held him suspended out the window. they both are shocked to see one another.}
<C>__{mr. thomerson}
<D>__{cole, my god, boy, what are you doing here? what happened?}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(nearly hysterical)}
<D>__{the bachelor party's upstairs. they made me get naked. they hung me from the window so high up it was so scary i fell down...}
<C>__{mr. thomerson}
<D>__{take hold of yourself. what room are they in?}
<C>__{cole}
<C>__{mr. thomerson}
<D>__{all right, i will go up there and take care of this myself.}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{you look awful, son. go find yourself some clothes.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{with a determined look, thomerson crosses to the elevator, as cole runs into the hotel gift shop.}
