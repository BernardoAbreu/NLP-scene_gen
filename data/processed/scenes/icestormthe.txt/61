<L>__{interior coffee shop. day}
<A>__{elena and philip edwards are having coffee again.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{in many ways, the church bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent child adult triad within us all. it's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you're saying that christ is the child, and }
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{ and god the angry parent, and the spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{all well and good but tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{you ask what the point is?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{self realization. ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. would you believe me if i told you i want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self realization?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{if that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... i mean...}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{my, i sound a bit }
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i'm sorry. that was stupid of me. i didn't mean to be so rude.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{you weren't. you actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{but not too ashamed.}
<C>__{philip}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{now you are being rude.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{and you're still trying to get me into bed.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{ouch.}
<A>__{just then, dorothy franklin passes by their table, a smirk firmly implanted on her face.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{hello you two. am i barging in on some kind of religious study group? elena, you look marvelous. will i see you and ben at the halford's?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i suppose we'll make an appearance.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{and reverend edwards? did you make the list?}
<C>__{philip}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i believe so mrs. franklin.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{with the two of you there it will be positively a revival! i'm off!}
<A>__{she scurries out of the coffee shop.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{i'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?}
<C>__{elena}
<P>__{(gathering her things to go)}
<D>__{i'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{take care.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{that i will indeed.}
