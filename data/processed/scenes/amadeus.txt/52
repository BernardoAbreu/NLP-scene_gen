<A>__{taking his instructions literally, the majordomo is marching very slowly toward the salon door. he is followed by a bewildered mozart, dressed very stylishly and wearing one of the wigs from the perruqier.}
<L>__{interior royal palace grand salon day 1780's}
<A>__{joseph finishes the march. the door opens.}
<C>__{majordomo}
<D>__{herr mozart.}
<A>__{mozart comes in eagerly. immediately the march begins, played by his majesty. all the courtiers stand, listening with admiration. joseph plays well, but applies himself fiercely to the manuscript. mozart, still bewildered, regards the scene, but does not seem to pay attention to the music itself. it finishes and all clap obsequiously.}
<D>__{orsini rosenberg bravo, your majesty!}
<C>__{von strack}
<D>__{well done, sire!}
<A>__{the emperor rises, pleased with himself. he snatches the manuscript off the stand and holds it in his hand for the rest of the scene.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{gentlemen, gentlemen, a little less enthusiasm, i beg you. ah, mozart.}
<A>__{he extends his hand. mozart throws himself to his knees, and to joseph's discomfort kisses the royal hand with fervour.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{your majesty!}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{no, no, please! it is not a holy relic.}
<P>__{(raising mozart up)}
<D>__{you know we have met already? in this very room. perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{he was giving the most brilliant little concert here. as he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. my sister antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? jumped straight into her arms and said, will you marry me, yes or no?}
<A>__{embarrassed, mozart bursts into a wild giggle. joseph helps him out.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{you know all these gentlemen, i'm sure.}
<A>__{von strack and bonno nod.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{the baron von swieten.}
<C>__{von swieten}
<D>__{i'm a great admirer of yours, young man. welcome.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{oh, thank you.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{the director of our opera. count orsini rosenberg.}
<C>__{mozart}
<P>__{(bowing excitedly)}
<D>__{oh sir, yes! the honour is mine. absolutely.}
<A>__{orsini rosenberg nods without enthusiasm.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{and here is our illustrious court composer, herr salieri.}
<C>__{salieri}
<P>__{(taking his hand)}
<D>__{finally! such an immense joy. diletto straordinario!}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{i know your work well, signore. do you know i actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{mio caro adone.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{ah!}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{a funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{and now he has returned the compliment. herr salieri composed that march of welcome for you.}
<C>__{mozart}
<P>__{(speaking expertly)}
<D>__{really? oh, grazie, signore! sono commosso! e un onore per mo eccezionale. compositore brilliante e famossissimo!}
<A>__{he bows elaborately. salieri inclines himself, dryly.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{my pleasure.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{well, there it is. now to business. young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. what do you say?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{majesty!}
<C>__{joseph}
<P>__{(to the courtiers)}
<D>__{did we vote in the end for german or italian? orsini rosenberg well, actually, sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to italian.}
<C>__{von strack}
<D>__{did we?}
<C>__{von swieten}
<D>__{i don't think it was really decided, director.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{oh, german! german! please let it be german.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{why so?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{because i've already found the most wonderful libretto! orsini rosenberg oh? have i seen it?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{i i don't think you have, herr director. not yet. i mean, it's quite n of course, i will show it to you immediately. orsini rosenberg i think you'd better.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{well, what is it about? tell us the story.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{it's actually quite amusing, majesty. it's set the whole thing is set in a in a }
<A>__{he stops short with a little giggle.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{yes, where?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{in a pasha's harem, majesty. a seraglio.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{ah ha. orsini rosenberg you mean in turkey?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{exactly. orsini rosenberg then why especially does it have to be in german?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{well not especially. it can be in turkish, if you really want. i don't care.}
<A>__{he giggles again. orsini rosenberg looks at him sourly.}
<C>__{von swieten}
<P>__{(kindly)}
<D>__{my dear fellow, the language is not finally the pointerior do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{why not? it's charming. i mean, i don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! it's not indecent!}
<P>__{(to joseph)}
<D>__{it's highly moral, majesty. it's full of proper german virtues. i swear it. absolutely!}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{well, i'm glad to hear that.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{excuse me, sire, but what do you think these could be? being a foreigner, i would love to learn.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{cattivo again, court composer. well, tell him, mozart. name us a german virtue.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{love, sire!}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{ah, love! well of course in italy we know nothing about that.}
<A>__{the italian faction orsini rosenberg and bonno laugh discreetly.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{no, i don't think you do. i mean watching italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching. stupid fat couples rolling their eyes about! that's not love it's just rubbish.}
<A>__{an embarrassed pause. bonno giggles in nervous amusement.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{majesty, you choose the language. it will be my task to set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch.}
<A>__{pause. joseph is clearly pleased.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{well, there it is. let it be german.}
<A>__{he nods he has wanted this result all the time. he turns and makes for the door. all bow. then he becomes aware of the manuscript in his hand.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{ah, this is yours.}
<A>__{mozart does not take it.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{keep it, sire, if you want to. it is already here in my head.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{what? on one hearing only?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{i think so, sire, yes.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{show me.}
<A>__{mozart bows and hands the manuscript back to the emperor. then he goes to the forte piano and seats himself. the others, except for salieri, gather around the manuscript held by the king. mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly accuracy.}
<C>__{mozart}
<P>__{(to salieri)}
<D>__{the rest is just the same, isn't it?}
<A>__{he plays the first half again but stops in the middle of a phrase, which he repeats dubiously.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{that really doesn't work, does it?}
<A>__{all the courtiers look at salieri.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{did you try this? wouldn't it be just a little more ?}
<A>__{he plays another phrase.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{or this yes, this! better.}
<A>__{he plays another phrase. gradually, he alters the music so that it turns into the celebrated march to be used later in the marriage of figaro, non piu andrai. he plays it with increasing abandon and virtuosity. salieri watches with a fixed smile on his face. the court watches, astonished. he finishes in great glory, takes his hands off the keys with a gesture of triumph and grins.}
