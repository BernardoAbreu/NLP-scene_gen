<L>__{exterior mi 6 london day}
<A>__{the db 5 drives past the guard.}
<L>__{interior conference room day}
<A>__{debriefing: bond, m, and several others listen as nato colonel dominique everhart, (early 30's, belgian,) refers to video clips from the khyber pass sequence:}
<C>__{col. dominique everhart}
<D>__{to sum up: after analyzing the tire inflation of the fork lift in the mi 6 video tape, nato believes the "red box contains approximately eighty kilograms of u235 weapons grade uranium an incredibly hard, incredibly heavy, incredibly lethal substance.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{and that's enough enriched uranium to produce how many nuclear devices?}
<C>__{col. dqminique everhart}
<D>__{depending on the builder's sophistication one crude bomb that could devastate london, paris, new york, berlin or all four if they have the latest technology.}
<A>__{there's a pregnant pause in the room.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{and the participants?}
<C>__{col. dominique everhart}
<P>__{(pointing at the screen)}
<D>__{kim dae yung. moscow trained north korean nuclear weapons specialist; apparently fell out of favor with the current north korean regime after a botched attempt to steal fissionable material from a british light water reactor in south africa an accident that left him entirely hairless...}
<A>__{another face appears on the screen:}
<C>__{col. dominique everhart }
<D>__{and rendera sikrahm, also known as richard stamper. freelance mercenary, laos and cambodia. his father was from nepal a ghurka warrior con scripted by the british government to fight in china during world war ii after which the family settled in hong kong, where the young stamper was undoubtedly treated like a second class citizen by both the hong kong chinese, and local british.}
<P>__{(beat, aside:)}
<D>__{we've all read about the signs at the british swimming pools in hong kong that said "no ghurka's allowed."}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{nothing like a little imperialism to promote loyalty among the faithful.}
<C>__{col. dominique everhart}
<P>__{(stifles a smile, then:)}
<D>__{in conclusion: both these men have a vendetta against the world. they are nuclear armed, and dangerous. and having failed to get the uz35 through the old opium route the khyber pass it's nato's belief that their next attempt will be through bulgaria where the nato nuclear strike force will be there to stop them.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{thank you colonel everhart.}
<P>__{(stands, turns to:)}
<D>__{007, i'd like to see you in my office. why don't you and the colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{yes, m.}
<A>__{m exits. bond approaches dominique. she smiles, warmly. there's a mutual attraction but there's something else going on, unspoken.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{interesting presentation.}
<C>__{dominique}
<D>__{interesting video tape.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{they point, i shoot.}
<C>__{dominique}
<P>__{(feels her pockets)}
<D>__{do you have a pen? i just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{bond hands her a pen. she regards it cautiously.}
<C>__{dominique}
<D>__{... does this do anything?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{depends what number you write.}
<A>__{she gives him a wry look; starts to write. he notes her wedding band.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{married?}
<C>__{dominique}
<D>__{happily.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{... kids?}
<C>__{dominique}
<D>__{three. you? married?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{dominique}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i didn't think so.}
<A>__{for an instant, something crosses bond's face: bittersweetness? re morse? either way, she's scored a subtle victory.}
<C>__{dominique}
<D>__{here. i gave you my assistant's phone number. if it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(beat, holding her gaze)}
