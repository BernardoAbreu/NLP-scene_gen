<A>__{is right underneath where the ice flows over the wall. gabe takes his handheld crampon and hammers it into the ice overhead with more force than usual. this one is going to have to hold. gabe steels himself for a tough move with one hand gripping that crampon, he swings out, away from the wall. only the crampon spikes jammed into the ice above his hand are keeping gabe from falling. gabe needs the second crampon to make the move up but that's not going to be easy to get. it's attached to his boot. as gabe clings to the upper crampon, his body swaying, he reaches down with his free hand to loosen the other crampon. gabe's pov down the ground is one slip and five thousand feet away. gabe fumbles desperately with the buckles on the crampons but both his fingers, and the buckles, are frozen stiff gabe's face shows real, solid terror for the first time gabe's pov down gabe gets the first buckle off then the second. the crampon is off his boot.}

<A>__{still swinging from one hand, takes the now freed crampon and slams it into the ice. it doesn't hold but the force of gabe's swing, pushing him away, has loosened the other crampon. gabe only gets one more shot at this he swings the free crampon up with all his might it catches in the same split second as the other dislodges. but the hard part is over with the two crayons, gabe quickly manages to climb up over the lip of}

<A>__{this is a field of ice sloping up to the top. gabe pulls himself a few feet away from the edge, and puts the crampons back on his feet where they belong. it's now pretty simple for gabe to run up the ice slope three hundred yards to}
<B>__{the summit}
<A>__{which is a rocky, wooded area. gabe seems to have a second wind now he runs to the other side of the summit. the other side is obviously the route hal and the others will be taking beneath the summit is a winding, well beaten path. gabe finally arrives at a small shack with a sign nearby commemorating the "douglas expedition 1933".}
