<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{a carpenter and his assistant are raising the base of the double bed. georges watches.}
<L>__{interior hallway living room day}
<A>__{the door of the apartment is opened. georges comes in. behind him is anne in a wheelchair, pushed by a paramedic. a second paramedic (as young as the finerst) follows with a suitcase and a large bag. behind them, the superintendent. georges tries to rid of the three as quickly as possible. he stuffs a twenty euro note into the hand of the first paramedic.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{here. thank you very much. it's for both of you. you can just put the things down here. there, beside the window, right. we'll be okay on our own. thanks a lot.}
<A>__{the two paramedics exchange a brief glance, say thanks, and leave the apartment, passing the superintendent as they go.}
<C>__{georges }
<P>__{(to the superintendent)}
<D>__{thank you, mr. mery.}
<C>__{superintendent}
<D>__{if you need anything, just call downstairs. if we can help at all...}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{right now everything's fine. i will let your wife know as soon as we need anything.}
<C>__{superintendent}
<P>__{(to anne)}
<D>__{it's nice to have you back, mrs. laurent.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{yes. thank you, mr. mery. thank you.}
<A>__{the superintendent hesitates another moment.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{yes, thanks.}
<C>__{superintendent}
<D>__{yes... so... goodbye then, ma'am. welcome home again. goodbye, sir.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{goodbye, mr. mery.}
<C>__{superintendent}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{he leaves the apartment. there is a brief moment of perplexity. then georges says:}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(with a nervous smile)}
<D>__{where do you want...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{in the living room.}
<A>__{georges pushes her toward the living room door, walks around the wheelchair, opens the door, comes back behind the wheelchair and pushes anne into the living room. the doorway is narrow. the wheelchair only just passes through it. georges pushes anne toward the sofa and the armchairs and then steps in front of her.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{shall i make some tea?}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(with a faint smile)}
<D>__{first come sit with me.}
<A>__{george registers her smile; he knows he's behaving in a clumsy way. he sits down in one of the two arm chairs.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{can you help me into the chair?}
<A>__{georges stands back up.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(eagerly)}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{he extends his hands. she puts on the wheelchair brake, lifts the footrest with her left foot, raises her right leg from the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm to georges.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{it's best if you put my arm around your neck and your right arm around me, that way it'll be easy.}
<A>__{he does as he is told, pulls her up as they hobble together the short distance to the second arm chair. cautiously, he lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight. because they are not used to it, the whole process appears awkward and clumsy.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he smiles because it seems silly to him to answer "don't mention it". then he sits down opposite her.}
<B>__{long pause.}
<A>__{at first they are both ill at ease, but then they accept the fact that words do not come easily. after a long while, during which we hear the intermittent sound of the traffic below.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(softly almost to himself)}
<D>__{i'm glad you're back.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(in a voice just as soft)}
<D>__{me too.}
<A>__{another pause. then anne says:}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{promise me one thing.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{please never take me back to the hospital.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what?}
<B>__{pause.}
<A>__{she looks at him. he has understood.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you promise?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{anne...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you promise?}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{anne, i...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{don't talk right now. and don't give me any lectures. please.}
<A>__{brief pause.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what can i say, it's...}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(interrupting him)}
<D>__{nothing. just don't say anything. ok?!}
<B>__{pause.}
