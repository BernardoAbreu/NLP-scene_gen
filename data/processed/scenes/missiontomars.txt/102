<C>__{terri}
<D>__{i can do it!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{no, terri, you can't! you don't have enough fuel to get me, stop us both, and get us back. hell, you come any farther and you won't have enough to get back yourself.}
<A>__{no response from terri.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{listen to me, goddammit! you have to stop! you have to stop now!}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{he's right, terri... it's no use.}
<A>__{terri looks at her armpad display.}
<B>__{close on display screen}
<A>__{as her fuel indicator drops from 50 percent to 49 to...}
<B>__{terri}
<A>__{releases her thumb from the toggle control.}
<B>__{her suit jets}
<A>__{stop firing.}
<B>__{terri}
<A>__{drifts, staring towards woody.}
<B>__{terri and woody}
<A>__{are on the same trajectory, going the same speed, and only about a hundred meters apart. but it might as well be infinity.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{okay, honey...? you gotta go back now.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{the hell i do.}
<A>__{terri raises up the tether gun and pulls the trigger.}
<B>__{the hook}
<A>__{comes shooting out of the gun, wire spooling out behind it.}
<B>__{woody}
<A>__{watches as it comes shooting down toward him. plate pov moving as woody gets larger and larger, the hook gets closer and closer, and then snap! the hook stops. angle on the tether gun the wire has run all the way out.}
<B>__{woody}
<A>__{looks at the drifting hook, ten agonizing meters away from him. his only life preserver.}
<B>__{terri}
<A>__{hits the button and the wire starts winching fast back into the gun.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{i'm gonna jet a little closer and try again.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{terri, you spend any fuel getting closer, you won't get back, and if anyone tries to get you, they'll die too.}
<A>__{no response from terri.}
<B>__{the hook}
<A>__{is whipping back toward terri and the gun. woody's voice cracks; he's very close to tears. pleading now.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{honey, please go back. go back and help everyone get down to the surface.}
<A>__{the hook slams back against the muzzle of the gun. terri resets the gun quickly, in an anguished fury.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{i am not losing you.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{i can't let you do it. i can't. i'm sorry.}
<B>__{terri}
<A>__{looks at woody, two hundred meters away, sensing something different in his voice now, a terrible resolve...}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{woody...?}
<B>__{woody}
<A>__{raises his hands to his helmet ring. his eyes shining.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{i love you, terri. god how i love you.}
<A>__{he unscrews the ring, pops the seal. the outrush of air pushes his helmet all the way off. woody shuts his eyes and opens his mouth.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{woody, nooooooo...!!!}
<A>__{ice crystals bloom with woody's last breath. there's nothing to suck in. he doesn't fight it. he lets death come.}
<B>__{angle on terri}
<A>__{tears streaming, chest heaving, frantic.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{woody, oh woody, please god, no!}
<B>__{her thumb}
<A>__{hovers over her suit jet toggle control. mcconnell's voice, from the distance, sounds very tired. like he's aged fifty years in the blink of an eye.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{come back, terri.}
<A>__{terri's thumb is still poised. death would be better.}
<B>__{angle on mcconnell}
<A>__{outside the remo. the hatch is still open. we see phil inside, staring out anxiously towards terri.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<P>__{(quietly, simply)}
<D>__{he's gone.}
<A>__{he sees no movement from the distant, small figure of terri.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{please, terri...}
<P>__{(long beat)}
<D>__{we need you.}
<A>__{terri's thumb pushes the toggle control... to one side, not forward. terri's face inside her helmet, is streaming with tears. she turns herself around, reluctantly. heads slowly back towards the remo.}
