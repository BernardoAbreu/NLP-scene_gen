<T>__{camera on:}
<A>__{i e. fast food restaurant drive thru jimmy's car day jimmy's pulled forward to the drive thru while judy tapes from passenger seat. a voice squawks at jimmy, asking for his order.}

<A>__{the drive thru window voice rattles off a price and tells him to pull up. jimmy continues to camera.}

<C>__{judy }
<P>__{(jokingly)}
<D>__{you cheated on me! i want to be the only person responsible for making you cum.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i hope you're willing to be on call twenty four hours a day.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{seriously, what did you do? what was a day in the life of jimmy in the nut house?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{well, besides masturbating, i talked and talked and talked and fucking talked until they were satisfied. but basically i told them what they wanted to hear. i said shit like...}
<A>__{jimmy does an over the top mock sincerity speech.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{"now that i'm finally able to talk about my problems, i now realize that my behavior was inappropriate and harmful to others."}
<A>__{judy laughs.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{then i figured it out. i had to cry as much as possible. whenever someone would cry they'd call it a "break through." so i'd be like.}
<A>__{jimmy does an imitation of himself in therapy. he looks directly into the lens.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you start out slow, then you build it up like this... "now i know that using violence is not the answer."}
<A>__{jimmy is getting progressively sappier and more over the top with his self impersonation.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{then you go like this:}
<P>__{(snaps back into the impersonation)}
<D>__{i was wrong, i know i was wrong and i will never do it again. i don't want to hurt people or myself.}
<A>__{jimmy does an obnoxious fake cry.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{boo hoo, waaaaaa, boo hoo hoo, waaaaaaa.}
<P>__{(snaps out of it)}
<D>__{then you always give them the obligatory hug at the end. after a couple of weeks, then they officially diagnose you with something, give you a prescription, then you're done.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{god, you're a genius.}
<A>__{jimmy pulls up to the drive through window and pays the cashier who hands him the a paper bag of food. jimmy pulls away and parks. judy continues to question him as he goes through his bag of food.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{so what did they say you have?}
<A>__{jimmy munches on some fries.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{odd. oppositional defiance disorder.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{you're so lucky. i wish i was diagnosed with something. what does it mean?}
<A>__{jimmy pretends he is reading from a text book 50's industrial spoof style.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{odd is a disorder characterized by an overwhelming pattern of negative, hostile, and defiant behavior which causes severe delusions where the patient can no longer distinguish fantasy from reality.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{wow. i love that!}
<A>__{jimmy smiles as he gets his burger out of the paper bag. he then opens the top bun of the burger to examine if they got his order correct. they didn't. jimmy playfully begins to act crazy.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you see. they fucked up my order. i specifically asked for no pickles.}
<C>__{judy }
<P>__{(playing along)}
<D>__{oh, no! how will odd boy handle this? will his odd brain be able to withstand a pickle screw up at the drive thru?}
<A>__{jimmy goes into a cartoonish like crazy person character. he begins by taking the pickles off of his burger. he puts the burger down, quickly lifts his shirt, holding it up with his chin while he places two pickles over top of his nipples. jimmy yells.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{ooow, jeez, they're hot! i burnt my nipples with the pickles.}
<A>__{judy cracks up laughing. jimmy takes a pickle off of his left nipple and dangles it directly in front of the lens. he then feeds it to judy. we hear judy chomping on the pickle and giggling off camera. the camera shakes then shuts down.}
