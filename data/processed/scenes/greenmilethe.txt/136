<A>__{dean starts babbling with relief as they return:}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{am i glad to see you! you were gone so long! wild bill's making noises like he's gonna wake up...}
<P>__{(notices coffey)}
<D>__{what the hell's wrong with him?}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{he's hurting, dean. hurting bad.}
<A>__{dean jumps in, helps them steer coffey into his cell.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{john, we're gonna set you on your bunk now. ready?}
<A>__{coffey nods, sits heavily on the bunk. he lowers his head, breath rasping like a rusted hinge. the guards step out.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{what about mrs. moores? was it like the mouse? was it a...you know...a miracle?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes. yes it was.}
<A>__{paul scans their faces. smiles are traded. an exultant beat.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{damn. i think we got away with it.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{we still gotta convince a certain somebody to keep his trap shut.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{get his stuff.}
<A>__{dean hurries off to retrieve percy's holster and baton. brutal unlocks the restraint room door, swings it open. percy is revealed sitting against the wall, glaring, his mouth still taped. paul crouches down. brutal joins him.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i want to talk, not shout. i take the tape off, you gonna be calm.}
<A>__{percy nods. paul takes hold of the tape, preparing to yank.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{my mother always said if you do it fast, it won't hurt so much.}
<A>__{paul rips the tape off. percy's eyes water with pain.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{i guess she was wrong.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{get me out of this nut coat.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{in a minute.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{now! now! right n }
<A>__{paul slaps him hard, knocks him sideways. percy looks up, blinking in surprise. paul grabs him, yanks him back up.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you shut up and listen. you deserved to be punished for what you did to del. you'll accept it like a man, or we'll make you sorry you were ever born. we'll tell people how you sabotaged del's execution }
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{sabotaged!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{ and how you pissed yourself like a frightened little girl. yes, we'll talk, that's a given but, percy, mind me now...we'll also see you beaten within an inch of your life.}
<A>__{percy blinks, unable to grasp that.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we know people, too, are you so foolish you don't realize that? people with friends and loved ones doing time in this prison. people who'd be happy to amputate you nose or your penis just so someone they care about could get an extra three hours in the exercise yard every week.}
<P>__{(off percy's look)}
<D>__{let bygones be bygones. nothing's hurt so far but your pride...and nobody need ever know about that except the people in this room.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{what happens on the mile, stays on the mile. always has.}
<A>__{a long pause. softly:}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{may i be let out of this coat now?}
<A>__{they pull him to his feet, undo the straps. he shrugs out of the straitjacket and adjusts his clothes, trying to maintain a shred of dignity.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{my things?}
<A>__{dean hands them over. percy smooths his hair and puts his hat on, starts strapping on his holster belt.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{think it over, percy.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{oh, i intend to. i intend to think about it very hard. starting right now.}
<A>__{percy exits the restraint room. brutal whispers to paul:}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{he'll talk. sooner or later.}
<A>__{paul nods with weary resignation yeah, i know.}
<B>__{on the mile}
<A>__{percy pauses near coffey's cell, careless as always, getting his holster buckled and a massive black arm grabs him through the bars. his scream brings paul and the others from the restraint room. coffey's face is pressed so tight between his bars it looks like he's trying to push his head through. he draws his lips back, baring his teeth in an awful sneer... percy whacks him with his baton. coffey barely seems to feel it. he curls his free hand around the back of percy's head, pulling him ever closer... ...and percy's screams are muffled as their mouths come together. coffey begins exhaling as if he'd held his breath for hours. percy jerks like a fish on a hook, but can't get away. the men jump in, try to pry percy loose, hollering for coffey to let him go. the black "insects" are flowing from coffey to percy, swirling into his mouth, up his nose, down his throat. several lightbulbs explode in their steel cages up and down the mile. percy's baton drops from his nerveless fingers and clatters to the floor, never to be picked up again. and then coffey steps back, rubbing his mouth as if he's tasted something bad. the color has returned to his skin. percy, however, is ashen gray. his expression is blank as a sheet of paper, not a trace of awareness in his eyes. the men are stunned. paul raises his hand to percy's face, snaps his fingers. nothing. he tries again, clapping loudly. percy reacts slightly, eyes fluttering, swaying a bit.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{easy, easy. you all right?}
<A>__{percy says nothing. he turns and walks slowly up the mile, his movements vacant and disjointed. he comes to a swaying stop at wild bill's cell...and turns slowly to look in. wild bill is coming painfully around, groggily clutching his head. he looks up, see percy.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{what'a you looking at, you limp noodle? you wanna kiss my ass or suck my dick?}
<A>__{nothing for the longest moment. percy just staring... ...and then he pulls his gun and empties it into wild bill as fast as he can pull the trigger. bam!bam!bam!bam!bam!bam! bill takes all six rounds in the chest, reeling back across the cell. he hits the wall and slides down, leaving a smear, his face registering a final look of stunned surprise. paul and the other tackle percy and bring him down, wrestling the gun out of his hand. dean is almost weeping:}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{oh god, oh god, no...}
<A>__{percy is flat on his back, staring up at nothing. the black "bugs" come drifting out of nose and mouth, swirling in the air over his head. they turn white and disappear. the men are speechless. paul turns, sees coffey sitting on the floor at his bars, watching.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{punished them bad men.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{why wild bill? why?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{i saw in his heart. when he grab my arm, i saw what wild billy done. saw plain as day. can't hide what's in your heart.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what? saw what?}
<A>__{coffey reaches toward him, straining through the bars.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{take my hand, boss. you see for yourself.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{paul, no!}
<A>__{paul hesitates, torn between reason and coffey's pleading eyes. a whisper:}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{my hand.}
<A>__{paul can't help it. he has to. their hands come together. paul lurches wildly as that circuit starts blazing between them...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no...please...}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{gots to, boss. gots to give you a little bit of myself. a gift, like. a gift of what's in me so you can see...}
<A>__{...and paul sees: the detterick twins. kathe and cora. laughing and playing hopscotch in the dust under a later afternoon sun... a dinner table. family having supper late in the day, basket of biscuits being passed. twelve year old howie detterick taking it, passing it on... an hand with a paint brush slopping bright red paint on the side of a barn... kathe skipping to the head of the hopscotch squares, turning and starting back, laughing in the sun... the paint brush slopping more paint, dripping like blood... paul jerks and twists, trying to pull away, trying to break the circuit, but he can't, not till all is seen and done: marjorie detterick calling from the porch for everybody to come eat, supper's ready... a hammer pausing. klaus looking down from atop the barn... the detterick twins finishing their hopscotch, gathering their jump ropes from the dust, running across the yard... the basket of biscuits being passed to little cora, who takes a biscuit and passes it on... klaus coming down the ladder, calling to his daughters. the little girls running past the man with the paint brush, who turns and smile as they go by...it's wild bill. the basket of biscuits is passed one last time. a hand pulls one out, raises it for a bite. it's wild bill, smiling at the little girls as conversation flows around the table... paul screams, trying to pull away, but: the porch door is kicked off its hinges just before dawn, a figure looming in the doorway. kathe wakes, her scream cut short as the man's fist punches her hard in the face... paul trembles violently as if riding the lightning himself, pleading for it to stop, but there's one last thing: wild bill looms over the terrified little girls like a horrendous boogeyman, whispers to kathe:}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you lover your sister? you make any noise, know what happens? i will kill her instead of you.}
<P>__{(to cora)}
<D>__{and if you make any noise, i will kill her.}
<A>__{and he drags them out into the coming dawn... ...as coffey lets paul go. paul is gasping, back in the real world where his men are staring at him with wide eyes.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{he kill 'em with they love. they love for each other. you see how it is?}
<A>__{paul nods, numb. tears are flowing down coffey's face. softly:}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{that's how it is ever' day. that's how it is all over the worl'...}
