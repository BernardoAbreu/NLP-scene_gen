<A>__{a slide of what looks like enlarged grains of sand among giant carpet fibers is projected onto a screen. the lead crime lab technician:}
<C>__{sigy }
<D>__{we found traces of this in two places.}
<A>__{the slide changes to an overhead schematic showing the interior of the house where the dance couple was murdered. detective atwood and detective snyder are standing with sigy watching the presentation. atwood has a bandage covering the stitches over her eye.}
<C>__{sigy}
<P>__{(with a laser pointer)}
<D>__{here and here.}
<A>__{the red dot indicates an area just outside the kitchen and just outside the bedroom.}
<C>__{sigy}
<D>__{we did an analysis and it's made up of feldspar, alumina and kaolin.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{sigy}
<D>__{a high fire stoneware clay.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{like you make ashtrays and vases from?}
<C>__{sigy}
<D>__{this is more plates and teacups. it was slightly wet when whoever it was tracked it into the house and it stuck to the carpet fibers. we're thinking it was the killer.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{it could have been tracked in by a friend.}
<C>__{sigy}
<D>__{that's the thing, you see, the friend would have had to have been there almost at the same time the killer was. otherwise the samples would have been dry and the killer would have vacuumed them up.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{is the clay rare, is it difficult to get?}
<C>__{sigy}
<D>__{you can buy it almost anywhere.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{that's not much help, sigy.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{and this is the only incongruity you were able to find in the whole house.}
<C>__{sigy}
<D>__{we've done everything we know how to do. it sure doesn't break the case wide open, does it?.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{no, sigy, it doesn't. it does give me an excuse to ask someone some new questions.}
