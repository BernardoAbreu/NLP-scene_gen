<A>__{nathan windeman is in a bad mood. a frail looking man, mid seventies. tiredly spooning a bowl of soup. his sister alice watches tv nearby. in her lap, a pomeranian cleans itself. windeman scowls:}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{alice, please...?}
<A>__{alice stares at him. uncomprehending.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{your dog, alice. it and my appetite are mutually exclusive.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{what's wrong with the dog?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{it's simple. he's been licking his asshole for three straight hours. i submit to you that there's nothing there worth more than an hour's attention, and i should think whatever he's attempting to dislodge is either gone for good or there to stay. wouldn't you agree?}
<A>__{theatrical? nah. the old bat scoops up her pooch and beats feet for the door. the phone rings. nathan snatches it up:}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{the voice is soft. controlled:}
<C>__{samantha }
<D>__{hello, mr. windeman, i got this number from a realtor in pennsylvania. i'd like to speak with you.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{who... who is this?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{you tell me, mr. windeman.}
<A>__{nathan pales. blinks once. twice. manages:}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...charly...?}
<C>__{samantha }
<D>__{my full name, please.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{god, it really is you...!? chapter, they think you're dead, everyone thinks }
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{my full name. please...!}
<A>__{a pause. then:}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{you don't know your name.}
<A>__{he chews his lower lip, mind racing. jesus, no joke, this is her... he fights to control his voice:}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{your full name... is charlene elizabeth baltimore.}
