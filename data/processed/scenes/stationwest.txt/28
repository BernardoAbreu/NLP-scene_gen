<T>__{dissolve:}
<L>__{exterior stage line depot day}
<A>__{as haven walks through the wide gate into a compound. there are several unhitched stages and freight wagons, one or two in partial disassembly and being serviced. a colored boy is readying a horse and buggy and beside him, overlooking the yard activities, is a bespectacled man with rubber sleeve garters. he is the manager. he has eyes like armadillo and claw like hands; otherwise, he could be your loan agency man. seeing haven he crosses to him.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(looking him over)}
<D>__{are you the manager?}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{haven}

<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i've heard about you. you're the fellah who took mick marion apart.}
<P>__{(looking at him)}
<D>__{almost knocked me off my feet. but my feet ain't been any good since i followed stonewall jackson.}
<P>__{(keenly)}
<D>__{what business you got with me?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(handing him the note)}
<D>__{i'm the new boss.}
<A>__{the manager glances at the note, after moving his spectacles out of the way. he gives it back without a word, and turns toward the rear office door. haven halts him.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{wait a minute. you're not fired.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i got to be. there ain't enough work around here for one man, let alone two.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{two can loaf as easy as one.}
<A>__{jim goddard and jerry enter from the rear office door. jerry is the younger. goddard walks a little stiffly with the aid of a cane.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{mr. leonard!}
<A>__{they halt and look at haven. the manager jerks a thumb at haven.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{talk to him. he just took the reins.}
<P>__{(indicating the two lads)}
<D>__{this is jim goddard. he's a regular stage driver. jerry here runs freight to the sawmill. boys, your new boss.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{hello, boys.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(with a grin of hero worship)}
<D>__{i gotta start out of here for the sawmill before daybreak. is that all right, mr. haven?}
<A>__{haven nods, after a glance at the manager.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i seen that fight last night. it was sure a beauty.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{glad you enjoyed it.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{what i liked was the way you }
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{let's not talk about it. right now it hurts my hands to listen.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{he walks out, looking back with an awesome smile. haven looks curiously at goddard, who has been standing in silence, a thin smile on his lips.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<C>__{goddard}
<D>__{my last run. i stopped a bullet.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{did you get a look at them?}
<C>__{goddard}
<D>__{i wish i had.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i think i'm going to need you and not on one leg. so sit down and give it a rest.}
<C>__{goddard}
<P>__{(slowly smiling)}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{he obeys. haven watches and then turns to the manager.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i'm coming back later and sit behind your desk. i will need the keys.}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(taking keys from his pocket)}
<D>__{only things here that work.}
<A>__{the manager, gives them to him. then looks at him.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{son, i waste my time. i might as well waste some advice. you're full of blood and vinegar, but this whole thing has got something wrong with it. goddard only got nicked in the shin. you might not be so lucky...}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i might depend on something besides luck.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{like for instance?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{well the fact that they don't seem to shoot too straight.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{they don't need to when they shoot so often.}
<A>__{he turns, takes a few steps and turns back to haven.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{worry it over.}
<A>__{the manager turns to go, shaking his head.}
