<L>__{interior honeymoon suite}
<A>__{gaudy colors, mirrors, a cheesy heart shaped bed. gina's body drops down, unexpectedly softly, landing on the fluffy satin sheets. she's dressed in a skimpy piece of bright pink lingerie. she moans and tries to sit up. and four snake like strips of satin swoop out from under the bed and quickly wrap around each of her limbs, pulling her down and yank her tight. she's trapped. that's when the door to the room opens and in walks an incredibly huge fat man. he barely fits through the door as he closes it behind him. puffy cheeks, permanent seat, dirty fingernails, and a lecherous smile. gina's eyes widen.}
<C>__{fat man}
<D>__{hi there, princess. your mom's told me all about you.}
<A>__{gina screams as he approaches her, the ground actually shaking from his weight.}
<C>__{fat man }
<D>__{she said you're even better than she is.}
<A>__{he looms above her, now. starts to unbutton his shirt to reveal a hideous mound of hairy stomach flesh. gina is repulsed.}
<C>__{fat man }
<D>__{aw, come on. i'm really a nice guy. you know what they say. inside every fat person...}
<A>__{rip! krueger's finger blades jut out of the abdomen ad start tearing a huge slit up the front of his body. the fat man starts to fold back as freddy's head pops out of the front.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{...is a maniac trying to get out!}
<A>__{freddy steps out of the fat man, sluffing the bulbous remains aside. he towers over gina. that creepy serious look on his face again.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{now it's time for you to put out, gina.}
<A>__{gina gasps in horror as krueger moves in. but then a knock at the door.}
<C>__{room service }
<D>__{room service?}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{huh? i didn't order anything...}
<A>__{freddy frowns and walks over to the door. he turns back to gina.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{maybe its complimentary champagne!}
<A>__{krueger opens the door. on the other side is a dinner cart and a waiter behind it. the waiter is jacob. crash! jacob shoves the dinner cart into the room and into freddy's gut, shoving krueger across the room into a tumbled heap. three explosions of light burst into the room. the dream police materialize. freddy jumps up growling. power cop grabs him from behind. blade leaps over to the bed and in a flash of steel, releases gina from her satin bonds. jacob yanks gina off the bed and pulls her towards the door.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{freddy jumps out of power cop's grip and the dream police surround him as the two teenagers bolt out of the room.}
