<L>__{exterior the view day}
<A>__{camera pans around 180 degrees this whole conversation has taken place just inches outside a quiet little cemetery with picket fences and both ancient and recent headstones. steve scratches and gestures to the three acre memorial park.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{not much room for a pool.}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{we own the land. we’ve already made arrangements to relocate the cemetery.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{can you do that? i mean, isn’t it rather... i don’t know... sacrilegious?}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{don’t worry about it. it’s not an ancient tribal burial ground. it’s just... people. besides, we’ve done it before.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{in ‘76. right down there.}
<C>__{steven}
<P>__{(struck)}
<D>__{cuesta verde?}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{all three hundred acres. it was quite a job, let me tell you.}
<C>__{steven}
<P>__{(to himself, his mind racing)}
<D>__{i never heard anything about it.}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{well, it’s not something you go around advertising on billboards and the sides of buses.}
<A>__{steve is speechless. he looks back and forth between the existing cemetery and cuesta verde estates below.}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{what are you worried about? relatives and friends can visit their loved ones at broxton memorial park. it’s only five minutes further out for christ’s sake.}
<C>__{steven}
<P>__{(quietly, to himself)}
<D>__{five minutes. i guess that’s no great hardship. i suppose that would be okay.}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{okay with whom?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{whomever might complain.}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{nobody’s complained up til now.}
