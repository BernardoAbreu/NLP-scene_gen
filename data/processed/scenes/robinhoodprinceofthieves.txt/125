<L>__{exterior city square day}
<A>__{a full scale riot. the populace has turned. into the fray comes fanny little, leading a rabble of servants and kitchen staff, fighting with pots, pans, brooms, knives, hooks, and bedpans.}
<L>__{interior castle chapel day}
<A>__{nottingham slashes maniacally. robin is cornered, weakening.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{you should have stayed away, locksley. fools like you never learn.}
<A>__{a blow slices robin's arm. his sword flies from his grasp. nottingham gloats. two of his men scramble back to their feet. robin is beat... a war cry! aslan, followed by tuck.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{ali akbar!}
<C>__{friar}
<D>__{amen!}
<C>__{mortianna}
<P>__{(seeing aslan)}
<D>__{agh... the painted one!}
<A>__{nottingham glances over... a split second opportunity!... robin lashes out. kicks the sheriff in the gut, chops down his sword hand. his father's sword clatters to the floor. whirling swords in each hand, aslan attacks the other men. robin pile drives nottingham into the wall. the bishop makes his escape. tuck blocks his path.}
<C>__{friar}
<D>__{so! you sold your soul to the devil?}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{no, i swear it, in god's name.}
<C>__{friar}
<D>__{blasphemer! you accuse innocent men of druid worship while you practice the black arts yourself.}
<A>__{the bishop surreptitiously draws a dagger from his robes. a taloned hand grips a spear... mortianna creeps up on aslan.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(glimpsing her)}
<D>__{watch out!}
<A>__{aslan spins... too late. screeching, mortianna drives the spear into aslan's side. he cries out and slides to the floor. nottingham uses robin's distraction to regain his sword. back on the defensive, robin tries to evade the blows. mortianna drags marian out onto a balcony. robin cannot pursue. in acute pain, aslan struggles to his feet. grasping the spear where it enters his side, he pulls with all his strength. the bishop, concealed dagger in hand, approaches tuck.}
<C>__{bishop}
<P>__{(innocently)}
<D>__{i am sure you would not strike a man of the cloth.}
<C>__{friar}
<D>__{think again!}
<A>__{without an eyeblink's pause, tuck punches the bishop so hard, he flies back through a stained glass window.}
