<B>__{title sequence}
<A>__{as the jewxploitation music pumps, metallic slashes rip through the screen line by line, spinning into place to form a star of david. the title, "the hebrew hammer" slams into frame. title card: hanukkah present}
<L>__{exterior the chood day}
<A>__{we start close on a gift wrapped hanukkah present. we pull back a bit as mordechai jefferson carver (29), aka the hebrew hammer, a baaad jewish brother spins the package in his hands as he saunters down the street past a latke stand. he's a semitic super stud straight out of a 70's blaxploitation flick. he tosses the gift to maccabee, a young hasidic boy.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{happy hanukkah maccabee.}
<A>__{macabee tears open the wrapping paper and holds up the gift a hebrew hammer action figure. he beams. we cut back to the hammer as he smiles back. from o.c., we hear maccabee say...}
<C>__{maccabee }
<D>__{thanks hammer!}
<A>__{the hammer smiles back and walks off frame.}
<B>__{another part of the chood}
<A>__{we begin on the hammer's black boots and slowly tilt up as we dolly back with him. the hammer passes a line of three jewish princesses who swoon as he passes. he stops below the sign of a butcher shop that reads, "100% kosher meat." we push into his close up as he blows them all a kiss. the pubic area of their dresses moisten in synchrony. the hammer winks back. an old woman calls to the hammer from the window of a second story flat.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{hammer, why don't you come eat by us for shabat. my miriam is all grown up now. god willing, you should settle down and marry.}
<A>__{we punch in to a close up of a demure miriam as the hammer takes stock of the goods. she is an atrociously ugly girl wearing orthodontic headgear, and bespectacled with a pair oversized librarian's glasses. the hammer shakes off his wave of nausea.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{thanks for the invite mrs. kleinman, but right now g dash d's the only one for me.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{i can dig it.}
<A>__{the hammer continues on down the street. the old woman and miriam are framed in the bg.}
<C>__{old woman }
<D>__{hammer, you're the baaddest hebe this side of tel aviv.}
<A>__{the hammer stops for a second and smiles at the compliment.}
<C>__{hammer}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{shabat shalom!}
<A>__{he walks off frame.}
