<A>__{leonard enters, looks around as if for the first time. an anonymous motel room, except that tacked to one wall is a hand drawn chart showing the layout of some streets, and stuck to the edges of the chart are polaroid photographs, with arrows drawn from each photograph to a spot on the map. leonard inspects the photos. some are buildings, some are people. all have the handwritten notes on the broad white strip underneath the image. leonard gets polaroids out of his pocket. the first one is of the discount inn. he sticks it onto an already squashed lump of blue tack at the end of an arrow drawn from a location on the outskirts of town. the second photo is a blurred shot of a brunette turning in a doorway. the name natalie is written under the picture. leonard flips it over. on the back are two handwritten messages. the first one has been completely scribbled over, but the other one reads: "she has also lost someone, she will help you out of pity" leonard nods, then sticks the photo to the chart. he steps back looking over the polaroids one by one: natalie, burt, discount inn, teddy. leonard sits at the desk and opens the brown envelope. he takes out a photocopy of a car registration and a driver's license. both are in the name of john edward gammell, but when leonard looks at the picture on the license, he recognizes the face. leonard moves back to his wall chart, finds the polaroid of teddy and compares it to the license photo.}
