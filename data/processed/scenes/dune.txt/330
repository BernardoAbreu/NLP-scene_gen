<L>__{283. interior great hall arrakeen palace day}
<A>__{the guildsmen in the room are moaning and screaming and swarming out towards the doorway the fremen stop them. the emperor and all are amazed and frightened. there is a long hush. the old reverend mother then turns and glares at paul.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{don't try your powers on me. try looking into that place where you dare not look. you'll find me there staring back at you!! you bene gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required. here i stand. but... i will never be yours.}
<C>__{reverend mother}
<D>__{stop him, jessica!}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{stop him yourself.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning. in time you perverted the truth. you sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan. how little you understand.}
<C>__{reverend mother}
<D>__{you mustn't speak of...}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(using the voice)}
<D>__{silence!}
<A>__{the old woman is shot backwards by the power of his shout. her breath is knocked out of her.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{i remember your gom jabbar, now you remember mine. i can kill with a word.}
<A>__{ a fedaykin stand forward and recites from the prophecy.}
<D>__{fedaykin #1 ...and his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against the righteous.}
<A>__{feyd hears this and is angered.}
<C>__{feyd}
<D>__{the righteous!}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(to emperor)}
<D>__{there is a harkonnen among you. give the harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth.}
<C>__{emperor}
<D>__{if feyd wishes, he can meet you with my blade in his hand.}
<C>__{feyd}
<D>__{i wish it.}
<P>__{(steps forward)}
<C>__{gurney}
<D>__{this is a harkonnen animal. let me, please, my lord.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the emperor's blade.}
<A>__{feyd takes up the emperor's blade with a smile. paul takes out his crysknife. they begin to circle each other. paul smiles, circling still. suddenly, feyd leaps, his blade jabbing savagely outward, but paul easily evades it, moving away. they begin to circle again. he makes another pass at paul that comes dangerously close, but again, paul is away, a frozen smile on his face.}
<C>__{feyd}
<D>__{why prolong the inevitable? i will kill you! i will kill him!}
<A>__{feyd smiles. he lashes out biting paul's hand. feyd laughs in triumph. feyd leaps forward jabbing, his right hip also forward. yet paul, although a little slowly, again reels away. again, feyd thrusts. this time paul jabs with his crysknife, but feyd moves away effortlessly. feyd counters and kicks paul to the ground.}
<C>__{chani}
<D>__{paul!}
<A>__{paul is up instantly and he circles with feyd.}
<C>__{feyd}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{who is the little one? a pet, perhaps? will she deserve my special attentions?}
<A>__{paul jabs out, his crysknife slashing. feyd grabs his arm, and paul his, the two men locked in a straining clinch. feyd presses his right hip closer and closer to paul's body. paul strains to keep it away. suddenly, the gom jabbar flips out of feyd's girdle, but on the left side, and he lunges powerfully with it at paul, who just barely misses taking it in his skin. he throws feyd back, but not before feyd's feet strike out, sending paul to the floor. feyd leaps onto him.}
<C>__{feyd}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{you see... your death... my blade will finish you.}
<A>__{suddenly, paul, with lightning swiftness, pushes feyd up and over. he is on top of him in a flash. paul's crysknife flashes up, thrusting upward through feyd's jaw. feyd's mouth opens as the knife continues up through his tongue and through to his brain. feyd's eyes go wild, then glaze over as he jerks dead on the floor. paul slowly gets to his feet, breathing heavily. anger still seething in him, paul issues a sound a loud, horrible, powerful sound, and feyd's internal organs rupture and the stone floor under him cracks open. the fedaykin smile.}
<D>__{fedaykin #2 usul no longer needs the weirding module.}
<A>__{everyone stares in disbelief. paul looks to the emperor.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{now, i will tell you how it will be. irulan shall be my wife, opening the way for an atreides to take the throne.}
<C>__{emperor}
<D>__{i sit on the throne!!}
<A>__{ }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you will sit on a throne on selusa secundus, your prison planet. either that or you will die.}
<A>__{the emperor is still. paul moves to chani.}
<C>__{paul }
<P>__{(to chani)}
<D>__{the princess shall have no more of me than my name... no child of mine or touch the softness of glance... nor instant of desire.... this is my promise to you...}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{...my love.}
<A>__{paul turns back to the others. jessica turns to chani and whispers to her.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{think on it chani... we who carry the name of concubine... history will call us wives.}
<A>__{alia enters with two monks. she signals and one of them places a cloak over paul's shoulders.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the fremen have the word of muad'dib. they will have their holy war to cleanse the universe... they will have arrakis... dune... their planet. there will be flowing water here open to the sky and rich green oases. for the spice there will always be some desert. there will be fierce winds and trials to toughen men. we fremen have a saying...}
<P>__{(he stares at the reverend mother)}
<D>__{"god created arrakis to train the faithful." one cannot go against the word of god.}
<A>__{everyone in the room stares at him soundlessly.}
<C>__{alia}
<D>__{and how can this be?}
<A>__{there are three powerful drum hits.}
<C>__{alia }
<D>__{for... he is the kwisatz haderach!}
<A>__{ }
