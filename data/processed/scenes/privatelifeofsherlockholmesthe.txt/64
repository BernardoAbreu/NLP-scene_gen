<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior glennahurich cemetary day}
<A>__{under a leaden sky, the yew trees which give the place its name brood over ancient gravestones. holmes, gabrielle and watson come down an overgrown path, stop and look off. a rather meagre funeral procession is moving along the avenue which runs between the rows of graves. it consists of one normal size pine coffin and two smaller ones, loaded on a cart which is being wheeled by a couple of workmen. bringing up behind is a minister, with an open prayer book in his hands.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(a note of excitement)}
<D>__{the three boxes. is that it, holmes?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i would think so.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{the two small ones they must be children's coffins.}
<A>__{holmes starts to cut across between the graves, gabrielle and watson following. at the grave site, the workmen are removing the coffins from the cart. there is one large grave, two smaller ones. a couple of grave diggers stand by respectfully, caps in hands. holmes, gabrielle and watson come up behind a nearby headstone, stop and watch. at the grave site, the minister is finishing the service.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{... earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our lord, jesus christ. amen.}
<A>__{the workmen trundle the cart off, the minister following. the grave diggers don their caps, pick up their shovels. from their vantage point, holmes, gabrielle and watson are watching.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{it's so sad.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{sad and rather odd. there are no flowers and no mourners.}
<A>__{the grave diggers have finished filling in the graves when holmes, gabrielle and watson come up.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{morning. grave digger}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{morning.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{working you hard, dad? grave digger not really. this is healthy country. sometimes you sit around for weeks with nothing to do. then you get three in one day.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{what happened? grave digger an accident. aye. father and two sons, they say they were found floating in the loch.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{local people? grave digger no. nobody around here knows them. the story is that their boat capsized in a swell but i don't believe it.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{what do you believe? grave digger you may think i'm an old fool or an old drunk but i've living around loch ness all my life...}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{are you trying to tell us it was the monster? grave digger damn right. maclarnin saw the kids' faces when they were pulled out of the water looked like old men must've died of fright.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{incredible. grave digger is it? last easter sunday my wife and me, we were on our way to services, when suddenly... but what's the use?}
<A>__{he picks up a white washed wooden cross, plants it at the head of the grave. the other grave digger has inserted smaller crosses into the other two mounds of earth.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(taking some coins out of his pocket)}
<D>__{here you are, dad.}
<P>__{(hands them to the grave digger)}
<D>__{grave digger thank you... you look like nice people. if you're wanting a holiday in scotland, go to loch lomond, go to holy loch but stay away from loch ness.}
<A>__{he and his partner shoulder their shovels, move off.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(snorting)}
<D>__{to think that people still believe in that nonsense. here we are, living in the nineteenth century }
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{i'm ashamed to admit it but i was relieved when he mentioned a father and two boys. it could possibly have anything to do with emile.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it would appear not.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{however, there still remains the clue of the castle and the red runner wherever it may be.}
<A>__{they are about to get under way when suddenly holmes stops them. coming down the avenue toward them are four small boys, in knickerbockers and caps, carrying bouquets of flowers. without a word, holmes draws gabrielle and watson back to their hiding place, behind the headstone. the four boys approach the freshly filled graves. they remove their caps, lay their flowers on each of the two small graves, then kneel down and bow their heads in prayer. from their position behind the headstone, holmes, watson and gabrielle are watching the four boys, who have their backs to them.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{if they're unidentified graves, why are those boys bringing flowers?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{because it's their brothers who have just been buried.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{their brothers?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{and they're not boys. they're as tall as they'll ever grow. hand me some pebbles, will you?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{pebbles.}
<A>__{he picks some up from the ground, hands them to holmes, who tosses them in the direction of the graves. the pebbles strike a granite cross. at the sound, the four boys simultaneously turn their heads over their shoulders. despite their slight bodies they have the features of mature men. gabrielle and watson react to the sight.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{they are how do you say it in english? nains.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{midgets.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{boys with the faces of old men...}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i still don't see }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{would it help if i told you they were acrobats?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{not at all.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{do you remember a tumbling act six brothers missing from the circus?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{oh, yes that case you turned down i completely forgot.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{some of us are cursed with memories like flypaper. and stuck there is a staggering of miscellaneous date, mostly useless.}
<A>__{the four midgets have now risen, and putting on their caps, move off down the avenue. holmes, gabrielle and watson emerge from their place of concealment.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<P>__{(worriedly)}
<D>__{mr. holmes, is those are not children, then ?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{quite. the question now is who's in the third grave?}
