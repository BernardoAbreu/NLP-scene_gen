<L>__{interior executive offices, parrish communications day}
<A>__{parrish, drew beside him, proceeds through a high tech, but tasteful, maze, spiffy executive secretaries at burnished desks. neither looking right or left, somehow parrish man ages to acknowledge their bright smiles and deferential nods despite his swift entrance. he passes through an open set of doors and he is into his own suite, commanded by jennifer, his assistant.}
<C>__{jenifer}
<D>__{good morning, mr. parrish.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{hi, jennifer.}
<A>__{drew is still at parrish's heels, but now parrish stops at the open door, turns back to him, reminding drew that this is as far as he goes without being invited.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{so... board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{as close as a deal could be.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(bursting)}
<D>__{olympic.}
<A>__{parrish disappears into his office. drew, on his way out, glides past jennifer's desk.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{this is our lucky day.}
<A>__{jennifer acknowledges drew with a smile, rises and moves to parrish's doorway, waiting for the day's instructions, but parrish only nods to the door and jennifer quickly closes it, returns to her desk.}
