<A>__{john stands facing older will. don is in the b.g., edging towards the control panel and the descending core material.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we can go back across the portals to the past, to the functioning jupiter two, where your mother and sisters are still alive. we can use this core material to escape together.}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{and then what? all of us lost in space. don't you see? i can do what you never could. i can save us all.}
<A>__{don has edged his way to the descending core material.}
<C>__{smith }
<D>__{i'm afraid not. through the doorway comes young will, smith walking behind him, hand on his shoulder, gun to his head.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{never fear. smith is here.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{will, i. . .}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{don't move, professor robinson or this rather peculiar family reunion will be tragically brief.}
<P>__{(off don)}
<D>__{i will ask you to step away from that console, major.}
<A>__{don stares at him a beat. then obliges, walking over to join john. smith approaches the robot.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{well, well, some of us just don't know when to stay dead.}
<A>__{smith goes into his tunic and removes his modified control bolt.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{i borrowed this from the probe ship in hopes of taking over the helm once we were in flight. but i seem to have found a better use instead.}
<A>__{smith slaps the bolt on the robot's cpu. the automaton's arms go up, then fall limp. docile.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{let's try this dance again. you are the puppet. i am the puppeteer. do get it right this time.}
<A>__{smith activates the bolt. the robot powers up once again.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{robot, enable electric disrupters.}
<A>__{the robot's claws begin to glow with electricity. smith smiles.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{now that's a good gargantuan.}
<A>__{smith walks to older will, puts the gun to his head.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{say goodbye to your past. you're future lies with me. i'm going home in your place.}
<A>__{smith starts to pull older will away when will comes forward, staring at the time machine, eyes wide with awe.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you did it. just like i imagined. re routed the hypercore. but the natural power source, the delivery system. i never thought of those.}
<A>__{older will's smile is bittersweet as he places his hand on his younger self. touches his hair.}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{you will. the future is never what it looks like when you're ten.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{heartwarming. nauseatingly sentimental but heartwarming.}
<A>__{smith shoves the boy back to his father, turns to older will.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{we certainly could have aged better, i must say now, show me how your little time machine works.}
<A>__{but will just smiles.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{an odd moment for mirth, don't you think? what are you grinning at?}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{look around you, doctor. at this hostile world. do you really think a boy could have survived all alone?}
<A>__{smith close. puzzled. unseen, the boulder behind him seems to be moving, shifting. a voice comes, alien, yet terrifyingly familiar.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{never fear, smith is here.}
<A>__{the shape behind him unfolds, coming up now, long spindled arms and legs, ten feet tall, a hybrid monster, half spider, half smith.}
<C>__{spider smith}
<D>__{hello, doctor, how nice to see me again after all these years.}
<A>__{smith stands petrified as the creature approaches him on spindled legs, goes down on its second knee joints, coming eye to eye.}
<C>__{spider smith}
<D>__{the spider's sting had some unexpected side effects.}
<A>__{spider smith flexes his three jointed arm.}
<C>__{spider smith}
<D>__{but my unique gifts gave me an advantage in this quarrelsome world.}
<A>__{spider smith reaches out and caresses will's cheek. turns to john.}
<C>__{spider smith}
<D>__{after the women were savaged, i became the father will never had.}
<A>__{he grabs smith's arms and begins to move him about like a marionette, engaging in a bizarre dance with himself.}
<C>__{spider smith}
<P>__{(bending him)}
<D>__{but you, doctor. your crude ambition fills me with self loathing.}
<P>__{(twisting him)}
<D>__{you see i have looked within me and what i see is you.}
<A>__{with that spider smith lifts smith over his head and hurls him like torpedo through a torn hole in the hull, towards the rocks beyond.}
<C>__{spider smith}
<D>__{i never liked me, anyway.}
<A>__{spider smith turns to face the robot.}
<C>__{spider smith}
<D>__{kill them all.}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{spider smith}
<D>__{but my dear boy, once the doorway in time stabilizes, this planet is going to come apart at the seams.}
<A>__{smith throws the back of one hand over his forehead in a parody of a twenties starlet.}
<C>__{spider smith}
<D>__{i am willing to perish here on this world for the sake of your most noble mission. but your selfish father will only try to stop you.}
<A>__{his head comes forward, neck elongating so he faces will.}
<C>__{spider smith}
<D>__{once your mission is complete, none of this will have happened anyway. so why not just dispose of them?}
<A>__{but will's gaze is impassive. spider smith actually sighs.}
<C>__{spider smith}
<D>__{very well. robot, take them inside the ship and keep them there. if they move, then kill them.}
<A>__{ect. crater caves future maureen and judy are examining the heiroglyph stone. the ground shakes. birds scream. (over) rumbling.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{we've got to get to the ship. penny?}
<A>__{she turns. the clearing is empty. no blips. no penny. blip runs cut before them, grabs maureen's hand, trying to pull her forward.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{where is she, girl?}
<A>__{in blip's hand, a mass of colored ribbons from penny's wrists. blip waves them in the air, then races off. a beat. the women follow.}
