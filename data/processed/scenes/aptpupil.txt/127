<L>__{interior bowden house todd's bedroom day}
<A>__{after a moment, the sedan pulls away. todd turns away from the window and we see that he is holding the barrel of the rifle in one hand and the scope in the other. he takes a few breaths, tries to calm down. a burst of nervous laughter slips out of him. there is a knock at the door. two seconds later dick comes in. dick's pov: todd stands in the middle of his room. the gun pieces are nowhere in sight.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{everything all right, son?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yeah... fine.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i'm fine, dad.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{your mother and i feel terrible... like we...}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{it's not your fault.}
<A>__{dick grabs his son and pulls him close. todd doesn't know how to respond. for dick, it is like hugging a phone pole. he knows something is terribly wrong. todd stands stiff in his father's arms until he releases him.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{you know we love you, don't you?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i know, dad.}
<A>__{he smiles at his father, comfortingly. dick is not comforted.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{look, ahh, your mother and i are going to go down and talk to our lawyer. i don't want you to worry about a thing. it's just a precaution. i don't trust these cops. we're not going to be gone long.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{don't worry about me, i will be fine.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{your old man is on top of things, all right? i am going to take care of this.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i know, dad.}
<A>__{dick kisses todd's forehead. he turns to leave and stops.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{this afternoon, if you're up for it, we'll go do something. how 'bout it?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{dick tries to smile and goes out, the door, leaving todd alone.}
