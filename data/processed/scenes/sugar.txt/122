<L>__{exterior anne's porch night}
<A>__{miguel and anne sit alone on the porch. we can hear chatter from inside, where the others are clearing the table.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you like it here in iowa?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{yes. i like... many new things.}
<P>__{(thinks for a beat)}
<D>__{very different.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i bet. you've traveled a long way, huh? god must have something special in mind for you...}
<A>__{anne points out a small scar on miguel's scalp.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what happened there?}
<C>__{miguel}
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{uh... when i boy... um... i don't know }
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{tell me in spanish.}
<C>__{miguel}
<P>__{(in spanish, no subtitles)}
<D>__{okay... when i was little, i wanted to eat some cherries from a tree. it wasn't our tree, and there was a fence to keep us kids away.}
<A>__{anne hangs on his every word as if she understood perfectly.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{so i climbed up the fence to knock down some cherries with a stick, but i when i took my first swing whoosh. i fell. there was a lot of blood.}
<A>__{anne reaches out, lightly touches his scar. her hand lingers for a beat, until... ...miguel leans in and kisses her. she kisses him back for a beat, but when he puts his hand around her waist, pulling her closer, she resists. they separate. anne looks down at her feet, uncomfortable.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{sorry, i just... sorry.}
<A>__{miguel looks on, confused, as she stands. they lock eyes for an awkward beat.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i should help clean up...}
<A>__{on her way back inside...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{we have another meeting thursday... if you can come.}
<A>__{miguel nods. anne leaves him on the porch alone. he looks out over the corn fields.}
