<D>__{you had me come home early to }
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{don't be jealous. it won't happen again. it was just a goof.}
<A>__{martin stands there, speechless, while on the screen: becky dissolves into a puddle of tears as jason tries to console her. suddenly, she runs off stage. martin picks up the remote and hits "mute".}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{rudell? he let you go on?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{yeah, i thought it would be fun. i wasn't really supposed to, you know, "go all the way" but }

<C>__{mini}
<D>__{oh, by the way, some intern from your office stopped by earlier today with something. it's on the desk.}
<A>__{martin walks over to the desk and picks up an envelope marked "martin tannen". he opens it to find... an 8x11 photo of him and mini kissing passionately on the beach in mexico. this time there is no question as to the nature of their relationship. scrawled across the bottom in black marker is: "remember, i'm just across the fence". martin's eyes scan the photo, a look of resignation setting in.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{martin slowly holds it up for her to see.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(very evenly)}
<D>__{i think it's time i had a little chat with our neighbor}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{no, this is exactly what he wants! what if he's working with garson?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{then he can't blackmail me. wait here, i will be right back.}
<A>__{martin heads for the back door.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{no, please, don't do this! let me go with you!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i said wait here.}
<A>__{mini jumps up and runs over to him, grabbing his wrist.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{don't do this, we can leave tonight! we'll drive to mexico!}
<A>__{martin looks up at her.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{he'll never leave us alone, you realize that?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{no! let me talk to him, he promised me he wouldn't hurt us!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{he did? when?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{a few days ago!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you saw him?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{i went to try and find out what he knew! i spent the afternoon with him m}
<C>__{artin}
<D>__{you...spen }
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{i was doing it for us! i figured he wouldn't turn us in if i...}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{if you...?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{if i made him think i was... interested.}
<A>__{a wave of nausea washes over martin's face.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{and was he?}
<A>__{mini nods.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{please tell me you didn't.}
<A>__{mini hesitates.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{martin looks unconvinced.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{i just made him think i would, so he wouldn't turn us in.}
<A>__{when animals attack comes on the tv in the background.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{thank you, i appreciate your restrainterior}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{fuck you. i'd think you'd be a little more appreciative.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{who were you doing it for when you did it with that kid? huh? who was that selfless act for!?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{oh, like you're such a martyr for being faithful? it shows amazing restraint to limit yourself to just one stepdaughter!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{don't lecture me about fidelity! your mother was cheating within six months of the "i do's"!}
<A>__{he heads for the door again.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{now, if you'll excuse me...}
<A>__{mini grabs him again, desperate.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{please look, i'm sorry, i really am, but this isn't the answer!}
<A>__{martin grabs her wrist, forcefully.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{you're hurting me!}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(through his teeth)}
<D>__{calm down or i will snap it in two, do you hear me?}
<A>__{mini nods her head.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{now, i want you to wait here for me. do you understand?}
<A>__{mini nods again.}
<C>__{mini}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{please don't do this.}
<A>__{he lets go and calmly walks towards the sliding doors to the back yard. mini watches him go.}
