<L>__{exterior training area same day}
<B>__{establishing shot of training area.}
<A>__{all manner of training equipment is standing outside (wooden men, posts, hanging targets, heavy bags, iron palm jugs, balance beams, etc.). a monk, the drill sergeant (hereafter d.s.), is standing in front of a wooden post, driving his hand into the wood. the post trembles with every strike. drew stands next to the monk, watching him intently. again, the monk takes no notice of him.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{excuse me, master.}
<A>__{no answer.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{hello? busy, huh?}
<A>__{still no answer. the man is just slamming his hand into the post, over and over. drew sighs and walks on. he goes down a path, and flowering bushes are on either side of him. he can see the "pagoda forest" in the distance. at the end of the path, a monk, san de, is sweeping up the path. drew walks up to the monk and bows.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{master, may i ask you a question?}
<A>__{no answer nor response. drew's kind of tired of this treatment.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{what's the deal here? is everybody deaf in this temple? even if you heard me, you wouldn't understand, would you? huh, baldy? shine your head for a quarter?}
<A>__{he walks off frustrated, wondering what he has to do to get noticed. he walks back into the chanting chamber.}
