<L>__{exterior beach night}
<A>__{wild eyes behind the charcoal painted masks of primal man. the rhythmic beat of sticks clacking and voices chanting. the heaping of driftwood into piles. taught and powerful, the glistening bodies of young men. blue sparks leap from striking flint against stone. a flame is born. voices howl in guttural triumph. as the flames leap and singe the darkness, silhouettes of men pound the sand and cry out in a ritualistic dance. the goat watches from the shadows, bemused, as the dance builds to a frenzy. the night sky is filled with the building sound of raging fire, pounding surf and chanting voices.}
