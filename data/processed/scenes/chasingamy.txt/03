<L>__{interior comic book convention lecture hall day}
<A>__{hooper fills the frame. he comes off like a typical, pro black anti white homeboy.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{for years in this industry whenever an african american character hero or villain was introduced usually by white artists and writers they got slapped with racist names that singled them out as negroes: black panther, black lightning, black goliath, black mantra, black talon, black spider, black hand, black falcon, black cat..}
<C>__{voice from crowd}
<D>__{she's white.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{she is?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well bust this regardless.}
<A>__{we're at a panel discussion. the room is full. five creators sit at a long table, their names on placards in front of them. (one of them is a very striking girl.) the banner behind them reads words up minority voices in comics'.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(holds up comic)}
<D>__{now my book, white hating coon', doesn't have any of that bullshit. the hero's name is maleekwa, and he's a descendant of the black tribe that established the first society on the planet, while all you european mother fuckers were still hiding in caves and shit, all terrified of the sun. he's a strong role model that a young black reader can look up to, cause i'm here to tell you the chickens are comin' home to roost, ya'll: the black man's no longer gonna play the minstrel in the medium of comics and sci fi fantasy! we're keeping it real, and we're gonna get respect by any means necessary!}
<A>__{during the speech, holden and banky enter and sit up front.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{bullshit! lando calrissian was a black man, and he got to fly the millennium falcon!}
<A>__{hooper whips his head around, looking for the source of the comment}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{who said that?!?}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{i did! lando calrissian is a positive black role model in the realm of science fiction fantasy.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{fuck lando calrissian! uncle tom nigger! always some white boy gotta invoke the holy trilogy'! bust this those movies are about how the white man keeps the brother man down even in a galaxy far, far away. check this shit. you got cracker farm boy luke skywalker, nazi poster boy blond hair, blue eyes. and then you've got darth vader: the blackest brother in the galaxy. nubian god.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{what's a nubian?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{shut the fuck up! now vader, he's a spiritual brother, with the force and all that shit. then this cracker skywalker gets his hands on a light saber, and the boy decides he's gonna run the fucking universe gets a whole klan of whites together, and they're gonna bust up vader's hood the death star. now what the fuck do you call that!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{intergalactic civil war!}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{gentrification. they're gonna drive our the black element, to make the galaxy quote, unquote safe' for white folks.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{but vader turns, out to be luke's father. and in jedi, they become friends.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{don't make me bust a cap in your ass, yo! jedi's the most insulting installment, because vader's beautiful, black visage is sullied when he pulls off his mask to reveal a feeble, crusty white man! they're trying to tell us that deep inside, we all want to be white!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{well isn't that true!}
<A>__{hooper explodes, he pulls a nine millimeter from his belt, draws on banky and fires. banky goes down, falling forward into the crowd the crowd screams and starts to scatter, hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists in the air.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{black rage! black rage!! i will kill any white folks i lay my mother fuckin' eyes on!!!}
<A>__{the crowd is gone. holden sits in his chair, laughing. hooper steps off the stage and picks banky's head up off the floor.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(breaking character)}
<D>__{what's a nubian!' bitch, you almost made me laugh!}
<A>__{hooper sounds different actually, he sounds gay. actually he is. banky smiles.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{well what about you! you didn't tell me you were going to scream black rage'. i nearly pissed myself.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{how do you manage to get away with this all the time? shouldn't cops be busting your head open right about now?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{wrong coast.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(off gun)}
<D>__{well this right here she full of blanks, okay. and opiate gets all sorts of legal clearances before i go on.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{your publisher condones these theatrics!}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{condones? honey, they insist. i need to sell the image to sell the book would the audience still buy the black rage' angle if they found out the book was written by a.. a...}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{faggot.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{when you say if it sounds so sexy...}
<P>__{(he kisses banky full on the lips)}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(wipes his lips)}
<D>__{hey, hey! i will play your victim, but not your catcher.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{how is it that you sound like minister farakhan when you're on stage..}
<A>__{they turn to see... a beautiful, blonde, ruffled haired angel swinging her purse in a circle. her name is alyssa. she's the striking girl from the panel who didn't get to say much.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{...and the king of pop when you're nor.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{look out, boys this kitten has a whip.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(shoves and slaps him)}
<D>__{always before i get to speak! i swear the next con i attend and they ask me to be on the minority panel, if i see your name anywhere near the list, i'm passing.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(defending himself)}
<D>__{holden. banky this pile of p.m.s. is alyssa jones. she does that book idiosyncratic routine'. this is the fourth panel we've been on together, and even though she knows my publisher sets this up and pays for the event. she still gets mad when it ends with my act.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i just wish i was the one who gets to shoot you.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{that's what my father said when i came nay leapt out of the closet}
<P>__{(off guys)}
<D>__{these boys do bluntman and chronic', which outsells both of our books put together, hence they're never on a panel with the likes of us. they slumming right now.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{i've read your book. it's cute. chick stuff, but cute.}
<A>__{holden hits him.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(shoots him a look; to alyssa)}
<D>__{sorry about him. he's dealing with being an inker.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(to banky)}
<D>__{oh. you trace!}
<A>__{banky seethes.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(shaking her hand)}
<D>__{i really enjoy your book i'm surprised we've never met at any other con's before.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{lose the dick or change your skin tone and we can get to know each other on panel after panel while the pink black panther here plays chuck d. for the fanboys.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{hey, jealousy.}
<P>__{(to the boys)}
<D>__{i told alyssa i'd buy her a post rave drink. do the garden staters have to sprint to the lincoln tunnel, or can you stay for a round in the big, scary city!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{we're gonna take off soon...}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{we'll go.}
<A>__{banky offers holden a puzzled glance. then he nods to hooper.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{we'll go.}
