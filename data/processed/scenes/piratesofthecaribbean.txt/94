<L>__{exterior interceptor day}
<A>__{elizabeth watches as the black pearl comes about and then there is the low, loud rumble of two dozen cannons firing as one. the interceptor is hit. a barrage of shots follow; most find their mark. sailors dive for cover, leaving their cannons; clearly they are overmatched.}
<L>__{exterior black pearl port side day}
<A>__{barbossa laughs.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{strike your colors, you bloody cockroaches!}
<L>__{exterior interceptor day}
<A>__{another round of fire; barbossa shows no mercy.}
<C>__{anamaria}
<D>__{looks like they mean to send us under.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{there she's raised the jolly roger,}
<A>__{upside down. anamaria, gibbs, cotton, even elizabeth all know what this means. will doesn't. he looks to gibbs for an explanation:}
<C>__{gibbs }
<D>__{it's a signal. if we resist, it won't just be death. there'll be torture as well.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we're not going to just surrender!}
<A>__{gibbs that we are. the black pearl fires again, a double ball shot with a chain connecting the two. it hits the main mast dead ani a cracking, splinting sound as it breaks, falls to the deck. barbossa moves his ship alongside, preparing to board.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we can at least fight we might be able to kill a few }
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{will it'll go worse for us for elizabeth, especially if we fight.}
<A>__{will stares and nods. but his expression is still defiant. the deck slants; the ship is sinking. pirates swarm across on ropes, and take control of the interceptor.}
