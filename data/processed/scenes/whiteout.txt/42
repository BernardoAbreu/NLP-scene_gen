<D>__{yeah, hold on tight.}
<A>__{delfy leaves as carrie cranks the submarine type wheel lock in the center of the door. wham! the door is suddenly yanked from her grasp, slamming open against the building. wind knocks her back. the storm sings in an even dull roar. a solid white wall of wind driven ice blows past. the light is oddly dim. crack! the coffee mug delfy left on the shelf, breaks in half, exposing a cylinder of frozen coffee. it rolls across the shelf, falls, and shatters on the floor. carrie struggles back to the door and clips a three foot tether from her harnesses to a red storm line attached to the side of the building. she steps into the storm.}
