<L>__{exterior swamp clearing day}
<A>__{marie is standing in a clearing, staring at chad's wrecked car, at the top of a small slope, wrapped around a melaluca tree like a christmas present. her piercing screams force elena to come running...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{marie stops screaming, her face contorting in anger...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{no, i'm pretty damn far from okay...}
<A>__{she points to the front seat of the crashed car... elena can barely bring herself to look inside. marie shoves her in the back, pushing her towards the open driver's side door. elena gasps when she looks inside the car. chad's not there.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{he bolted...}
<A>__{marie clambers up the wreckage of the car, stands on the roof. she surveys the swamp all around her like the lioness she is...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{with the diamonds.}
