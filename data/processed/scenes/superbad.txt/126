<A>__{fogell sits bored in front of the tv, drinking a beer. he watches a bunch of girls flirt with some boys. everyone is talking and laughing while he sits alone. he walks over to the doorway of a room filled with girls dancing. in the corner dancing is nicola. he stares at her for a moment, then goes back and sits in front of the tv. he changes the channel and "cops" comes on the screen. it shows two cops chasing a crack head, tackling him and knee dropping him. fogell ponders as he watches "cops." he throws back the rest of his beer and marches into the room nicola is dancing in. he walks up to nicola, who is by far the best looking girl in the room, and starts dancing with her. she looks a bit thrown at first, but after a few beats, she seems to like it.}
