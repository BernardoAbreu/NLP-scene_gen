<L>__{interior johns hopkins gender identity clinic day}
<A>__{moving angle as the very impatient crawford, clutching a folder, strides down a hall beside dr. danielson early}
<L>__{50's, severe, in a lab coat. nurses, doctors, glance as they}
<A>__{pass.}
<C>__{dr. danielson}
<D>__{i'm not having a witch hunt here, mr. crawford! our patients are decent, non violent people with a real problem.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{dr. danielson, the man we want was never your patient. it would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. please, doctor time is eating us up. just show me the ones you've turned away.}
<A>__{danielson enters a cramped, stainless steel nurse's gallery, with crawford following, and pours himself a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{dr. danielson}
<P>__{(adamantly)}
<D>__{examination and interview materials are confidential. we've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you want to see a violation? this is a violation...}
<A>__{he takes a black & white photo from his folder, slaps it down in front of danielson. from our angle, we can't see it clearly.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{her name is kimberly jane emberg, she was just id'd. i met her on a slab in west virginia. and sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to catherine martin.}
<C>__{dr. danielson}
<D>__{that's a childish, bullying stunt, mr. crawford. i was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.}
<A>__{burroughs sticks his head in, looking for crawford.}
<C>__{burroughs}
<D>__{phone, jack. director burke.}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(snaps)}
<D>__{in a minute!}
<A>__{burroughs hurriedly retreats. crawford strains for patience.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{look... search your own records, if you prefer. you can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. if we find buffalo bill through your information, i will suppress it. nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.}
<C>__{dr. danielson}
<D>__{i doubt very much that the fbi or any other government agency can keep a secret, mr. crawford. truth will out... and then what? will you give johns hopkins a new identity? put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{oh, that's clever, dr. danielson. very humorous. you like the truth? try this.}
<P>__{(right in his face, enraged)}
<D>__{he kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. we don't want him to do that anymore. if you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the justice department is going to ask publicly for a court order, we'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. and each one of our press conferences will focus on dr. danielson, over at johns hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. and every time there's any news on the case when catherine martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' dr. danielson, over at johns hopkins complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.}
<C>__{dr. danielson}
<P>__{(pause; stiffly)}
<D>__{it may be that i could confer with my colleagues on this. and get back to you.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{would you, doctor? that would be so kind.}
