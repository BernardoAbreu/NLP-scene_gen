<A>__{place is empty. alan, colette, william, john, and henry gather around the center table. the writers at work poster is propped up against a nearby empty chair. hard not to notice the empty chair at the table. hannah is missing. waitress #1 pours coffee all around. henry fidgets in his chair, focused on the empty chair.}

<D>__{how come we never chow down at your place?}

<D>__{this is my place. close to the working people.}
<A>__{john rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{where's hannah? anyone know?}
<A>__{nobody responds. alan checks his watch.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{time to get started.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{shouldn't we wait for hannah?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{let's go, people. i'm ready to read.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{william's right. we'll start. she'll show up.}
<A>__{william starts passing out pages. henry eyes the empty chair. colette looks over william's pages. there are only three. she has a puzzled look.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{william, aren't these the same pages you read last time?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{nope, they're different.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{they look the same.}

<D>__{they're different. i changed a word.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{one word?}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{writing is rewriting, colette. bukowski said, "write five words. rewrite seven."}

<D>__{one word? jesus h. christ.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{it's my creative vision, john.}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(jumping in)}
<D>__{which we are here to support. this is william's decision.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{let me just read. see if you can pick out the word. tell me if it's better, or worse.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{one goddamn word.}
