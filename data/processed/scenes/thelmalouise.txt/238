<A>__{all the police cars are still following about a half a mile behind. the car is bouncing and flying across the desert. finally, they get about twenty yards from the edge and louise slams on the brakes. thelma and louise are just waiting for the cars to catch up. the police cars stop in a line about two hundred yards behind them. the dust from the cars is blowing across them. they just sit looking at the grand canyon. from the canyon, the fbi helicopter rises up in front of the car.}
