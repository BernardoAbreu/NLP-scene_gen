<L>__{exterior caveman village the paleolithic era night}
<A>__{everyone in the village is asleep. everyone, that is, but "loser caveman" who sleeps uncomfortably in his tiny little cave, tossing and turning, unable to get comfortable. a stirring in the trees causes "loser caveman" to sit upright. there's something outside of the village. something big. suddenly a giant tusked boar pushes through the trees and stands, looking quite menacing, not ten yards from the village fire. "loser caveman" is practically shaking with fear. the boar makes eye contact with "loser caveman" and charges directly towards his tiny little cave. the giant boar runs head first into the cave opening, but the opening is too small for the beast to fit its head inside. "loser caveman" screams like a girl. the boar backs up to strike again this one sure to be the end of "loser caveman" when a large boulder, knocked loose by the boar's first hit, tumbles down and lands smack on the boar's head, killing it instantly. the entire village runs out to see what has happened. the "loser caveman" stumbles out of the cave and dusts himself off. the chief steps forward.}
<C>__{chief caveman}
<D>__{the beast! it dead! caveman #2 hey, look at loser! he almost die! look he scared!}
<A>__{everyone laughs. the chief looks towards loser, standing nervously near the corpse of the giant tusked boar.}
<C>__{chief caveman}
<D>__{loser, what happen?}
<C>__{loser caveman}
<P>__{(shamefully)}
<D>__{the beast, it came at me. it smash my cave.}
<A>__{everyone laughs hysterically. we pan over the many laughing faces, pointing and hooting at loser caveman's cowardice. we watch as the "loser caveman's" face turns bright red, the veins in his neck pop out and his fists clench up tightly. suddenly we fly into the caveman's skull, traveling through his cerebral cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his small, homo erectus brain. sparks are flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession. there is a small explosion. we fly back out of "loser caveman's" skull his face contorted in rage. he interrupts everyone's laughter.}
<C>__{loser caveman}
<D>__{hold on one minute!}
<A>__{everyone stops laughing.}
<C>__{loser caveman}
<D>__{loser wasn't finished.}
<A>__{loser caveman stands up straight and tall all of a sudden the bruce willis of cavemen.}
<C>__{loser caveman}
<D>__{after beast smash cave, loser look at beast and say, "not on loser's watch." loser grab rock on ground, lift above head and smash it down... right onto motherfucker's head.}
<A>__{the entire village gasps.}
<C>__{loser caveman}
<D>__{loser kill beast.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{now fuck off, loser going back to sleep.}
<A>__{the chief steps forward ominously, then proclaims:}
<C>__{chief caveman}
<D>__{loser kill beast! loser caveman hero!}
<A>__{loser steps forward, grabs the prettiest of all cavewomen and drags her towards his cave as the entire village erupts in cheer.}
