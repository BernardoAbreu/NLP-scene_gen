<A>__{and finally we arrive on sheeni, expressionless. and as we continue to pan we reach... carlotta standing in the background. the bombshell haircut and thick glasses can barely be made out through her veil. paul finishes his trumpet solo and there is a moment of silence to observe the open casket and the single, let's mingle shirt and shorts that are being buried inside.}

<A>__{sheeni makes her way toward the line of limos and hearses. she approaches the distant carlotta.}
<C>__{sheeni}

<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{you shouldn't be, carlotta. i am no doubt culpable for nick's actions. nick carlotta well, love does compel us to desperate acts. people cannot always act rationally.}
<P>__{nick carlotta (cont'd)}
<D>__{the greater the love, the stronger the passions, the more reckless the crimes.}
<A>__{sheeni lets go a slight, wistful smile.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{yes, carlotta. nick had wonderful a way of making me feel worthy of the pursuit. nick carlotta my dear, if there's one thing the demise of nick twisp has taught me, it's that self worth comes from within.}
<A>__{sheeni gives a pensive nod.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{would you like to stay the night, carlotta? we can reminisce of our departed. nick carlotta oh, my. a kind offer, but i really must...}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{it's just... i don't think i could bear to be alone tonight.}
<A>__{carlotta does her best not to look conflicted, but it shows.}
