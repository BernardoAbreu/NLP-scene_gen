<DIAL>__{I think we both know where it's heading...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(A BEAT)}
<DIAL>__{If... you can maintain.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maintain?}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Eventually you'll run out. I just want you to know we're here to help you.}
<ACTION>__{Eddie blinks at him. Did he just say what Eddie thought he said?}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you saying?}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We've gotten most of the bugs out. It's longer lasting - you'll only have to take one a week.}
<ACTION>__{Eddie is now dead silent. A long beat. Is it possible? Is he really talking to someone who makes MDT?!}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Have you been watching me from the beginning?}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No. Those of you who indulged... distinguished yourselves very quickly. You made yourselves clear to us.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who's "us?"}
<ACTION>__{Steadman just smiles, waves the question away.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You went the furthest with it the fastest, so of course, to us, you're the most interesting.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How did it get on the street?}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Security breach. That was never our intention. We took care of it.}
<ACTION>__{Meaning, they took care of Vern.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{It will never again be on the street. It will never publicly exist. Obviously I don't need to detail the advantages for you.}
<ACTION>__{A long beat. Eddie doesn't trust this guy -- not a bit.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And what about for you? Why don't you take it?}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We don't have to. You'll take it for us.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And in return...? I do what.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Just keep on doing what you're doing. We won't bother you much at first.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And later...? What will you be "bothering" me with?}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, given where you're heading, some of our ideas are... grandiose. But, I think, achievable.}
<ACTION>__{Eddie takes that in.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And if I don't like your ideas?}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then we'll say Godspeed. And your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely, light.}
<ACTION>__{Eddie knows now. They own his ass.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{But let's not even go there. Right now you should feel relieved, your problems are over. We just want to keep you healthy... and brilliant.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Luckily I can do that myself.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, no, ah, that won't be the case. We shut your lab down this morning.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{My lab?}
<ACTION>__{Steadman nods.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Which one?}
<ACTION>__{Steadman doesn't blink.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{All of them.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You sure?}
<ACTION>__{Steadman suddenly chuckles -- not at all concerned by this. Even amused.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We were right about you Eddie - you're gonna go all the way. Let's not do anything to jeopardize that. There's no downside here - we're offering you a limitless supply with fewer side effects. I think you'll be pleased with the arrangement.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(BEAT)}
<DIAL>__{Come on, let's get some lunch. I'm starving...}
<ACTION>__{He heads for the door. Eddie remains still.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Tell me something.}
<ACTION>__{Steadman stops, looks back at him.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Did I kill that woman?}
<ACTION>__{Steadman looks puzzled that Eddie would ask.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you really want to know?}
<ACTION>__{Eddie thinks. No, he doesn't.}
<LOC>__{EXT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Eddie and Steadman exit, come down the steps, Eddie looking thrown. He drifts along, half-a-step behind Steadman, deep in thought.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not so bad, is it?}
<ACTION>__{Eddie doesn't answer.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Doesn't every man on the path to greatness have to tolerate the wind- drag of compromise?}
<ACTION>__{A black LIMO waits at the curb.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Overall, we'll all be better off... foreign policy, the courts, even the Constitution could stand a little tweaking...}
<ACTION>__{They descend the last few steps. Steadman opens the limo door for Eddie... But Eddie hesitates. Doesn't get in.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Eddie?}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{After you.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(CORDIAL)}
<DIAL>__{No, "Senator". You first.}
<ACTION>__{Eddie gestures for him to get in.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Please.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{All right then...}
<ACTION>__{He gets in. And Eddie CLOSES THE DOOR AFTER HIM. Stands outside the limo, looking back at Steadman through the rolled- down window, his face a cold mask.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Oh, now. Don't underestimate us.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't underestimate your own creation.}
<ACTION>__{Steadman looks at him quizically.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{I mean, you invented it. What does it do? It puts me 50 steps ahead of you fucks.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{You think I didn't spend my days on MDT devising a personal defense structure that would scare the shit out of the Israelis--? You think there's not people with a bead on you right now, right in this building? You think this conversation is private?}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You don't know the caliber of enemies you'll be making.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You want to push that button? I'll show you my silos if you show me yours.}
<CHAR>__{STEADMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You'll run out. You'll die.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Or I'll think of something. Isn't that what MDT does? Makes you think of something? Might even tell me how to get off it.}
<ACTION>__{A flicker in Steadman's eyes. Anger.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{What if I just ask the drug... how to tell the drug... how to fuck itself? I mean, isn't it like the 8-ball?}
<ACTION>__{Steadman raises his hand to the driver and the limo pulls away.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{It always answers.}
<ACTION>__{As the limo recedes into the distance, Eddie finally exhales. And only then do we see it. He's scared.}
<CHAR>__{THE END} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
