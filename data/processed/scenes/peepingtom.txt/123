<A>__{suddenly mark stands motionless. he is staring at something off camera. especially when her voice trails away... she is staring at mark staring at something. in the shadows, at the mouth of an alley, a young couple are kissing. mark stands motionless, staring at them. automatically his hand reaches for his camera. helen starts to speak then looks at him in silence. the man glances round. mark hurries away and helen stares after him. close shot of mark. he turns back waiting for helen. from his pov we see helen come slowly towards him. she looks at him searchingly for a long moment. he manages but only just to meet her eyes.}
