<A>__{...darkness.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{natalie.}
<A>__{bernie fumbles for the light switch...}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{no, don't. i've got a headache.}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(closing the door)}
<D>__{did you take something? i got some aspirin in the }
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{yeah. i already took something.}
<A>__{there's just enough moonlight in the room for bernie to make out natalie curled over on the bed. as he approaches, he trips over natalie's suitcase on the floor.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{ouch!}
<A>__{he cuts himself on a splinter of shattered glass as he staggers to his feet. which draws his attention to the mirror. moonlight glows off the edges. that's all there is edges. on the dresser: his bottle of ten high. empty. confused, bernie fumbles his way over to natalie on the bed.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{natalie, what happened? the mirror...}
<A>__{he reaches out to touch her face... instead his hand makes contact with a lump.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{natalie.}
<A>__{he jerks back, flips on the nightstand lamp.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{bernie, no! shit...}
<A>__{bernie chokes at the sight of her. she clutches a bloody rag to her cheek. blood on the pillow... blood on the sheets... and tears.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{oh jesus... natalie, who did this to you? we need to call the police...}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i love you, bernie. i just want you to know that. i fell in love with you. that wasn't part of the plan. i thought... easy money...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{shelly. he paid me to get next to you. to keep you around. whatever it took...}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{shelly?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{you got it right the first night. i was for sale. bought and paid for. you were the easy mark, bernie.}
<A>__{bernie slumps down on the edge of the bed. sucker punched. trying to make sense of it.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{at first you were just another john. but then i started to take a closer look. for the first time, here was someone who wasn't trying to hustle me. wasn't pretending to be somebody he wasn't. just a decent guy trying to get back on track. and it didn't hurt any that you put me up on a pedestal. it sure puts the gutter into perspective...}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(still in disbelief)}
<D>__{shelly...}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{shelly wants me gone. he says i bring you luck. lady luck. i stayed... to tell you to your face... and then you wouldn't want me no more... and i could just go...}
<A>__{bernie stands shakily.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{we gotta get you to the hospital. we'll talk about this later.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{just tell me one thing, bernie. tell me there's gonna be a later.}
<A>__{bernie doesn't answer her.}
