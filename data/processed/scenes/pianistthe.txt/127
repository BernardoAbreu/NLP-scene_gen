<A>__{szpilman at the window, watching. the horse drawn cab clatters out of his sight. he is about to draw back when he sees, directly beneath him, a man and woman walking with their hands in the air. then, a german soldier, pointing his rifle at their backs, appears. suddenly, the man and woman begin to run. the man turns and disappears. the woman also turns, but the german soldier drops to one knee and fires. the woman clutches her stomach, drops slowly to her knees and collapses on the street in an awkward kneeling position, and that's how she remains. szpilman watches, aghast. then, he hears voices outside his door, shouts, footsteps, panic.}
