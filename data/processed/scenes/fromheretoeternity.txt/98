<B>__{close shot holmes}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{ i've known about it for a long time! i've sensed it. and i'm not going to ignore it any longer! i want to know where you met him and just who he is.}
<B>__{medium shot holmes and karen}
<A>__{at breakfast in a nook off the kitchen. holmes is a mixture of petulance, anger and frustration. he doesn't touch his food, but occasionally takes a sip of coffee.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm afraid i'm not going to tell you.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you can't keep a thing like this hidden&}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm not going to hide anything. i'm just not going to tell you.}
<A>__{she applies herself to her food, anxious to drop the matter.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{one thing i know. i know it's a civilian. you'd be too discreet to pick an army man.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i don't think it's any of your business who he is.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it is my business! i'm your husband! what do you think a scandal would do to my chances for a promotion? so if you're thinking of a divorce, you can forget it!}
<A>__{karen stiffens. she struggles to maintain her self possession. she manages it, keeps outwardly calm through the scene.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{now how does it feel to know you'll have to live with a horror like me the rest of your life?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{not very nice. but then there's the compensation of knowing you'll have to live with me the rest of your life.}
<A>__{her attitude makes holmes progressively sorrier for himself. camera moves with him as during following he rises, goes to stove, pours himself another cup of coffee. he spills a little and the liquid sizzles on the burner.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you don't know how a man feels about a thing like this. it breaks a man all up inside.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{i gander why men feel so differently about it than women.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it's it's just not the same.}
<A>__{camera moves with him as he returns to the table, decides to try another tack.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{why do you think i've done all i have...?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{done all what?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{tried to be a company commander when i hate it, worked my fool head off with this miserable boxing squad, tagged after the general whenever i could.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i don't know. why?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{why, for you and for me. for our home, that's why.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{i always thought you did it because you wanted to get ahead.}
<A>__{she finishes the last of her food, stands.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it's a lovely day out. i think i will go for a walk.}
<A>__{holmes catches her wrist, stops her.}
<C>__{holds}
<D>__{i'm willing to forgive you. tell me who he is. make a clean breast of it. and i will forgive you.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i wonder which is hurt more your pride or your curiosity?}
<A>__{she disengages her wrist.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{when i'm ready to ask you for a divorce we can discuss it again.}
<A>__{she goes to door to pantry, pauses there.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(maternally)}
<D>__{and do eat your breakfast, dana. it's getting cold.}
<A>__{she goes out to pantry. we hear the sound of the door to rear porch opening and closing.}
<B>__{medium close shot holmes}
<A>__{wretched, completely at a loss. he stares into space, then looks down at his food, picks up a fork and ruefully begins to eat.}
