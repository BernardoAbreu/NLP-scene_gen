<L>__{exterior yokohama harbor day}
<A>__{like all japan, yokohama is at the cusp of a new era. ancient sampans and wooden schooners beside freighters and steamships.}
<L>__{exterior yokohama dock day}
<A>__{after 23 days at sea, they are all glad to climb down the gangplank. the yokohama docks are a frenzy of languages and looks and smells and sounds. japanese competes with german and english and french and russian. warehouses fl y the flags of a dozen countries. one striking japanese character dominates: the symbol for, omura. it is seen on buildings, warehouses, and the headbands of scores of laborers. a series of palanquins, litters carried by bearers, await our voyagers. as does simon graham, a dissipated englishman who has lived in japan for many yean. slender and pale, with an occasional consumptive cough, in his 50's, he wears a white linen suit, a bit worse for wear.}

<D>__{they're gonna carry us?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{you're guests of the emperor. you cannot walk.}
<A>__{algren notes the hoods covering the faces of the palanquin bearers.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{why the hoods?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{so you won't have to burden your eyes by looking at slaves. oh, excuse me, they're servants now.}
<P>__{(coughs, wipes a bit of blood)}
<D>__{this wa y, gentlemen...}
