<L>__{interior cockpit another shot}
<A>__{(aura, flash) another moon rising ahead. its reddish desert surface is swept by a raging sandstorm.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{some lucky people live on that one too?}
<C>__{aura}
<D>__{of course the sand men. every moon is a kingdom seperate and hostile to all the others. they have nothing in common but ming's rule and their hatred of him.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{why don't they team up and fight him?}
<C>__{aura}
<D>__{fight ming the merciless?}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{you saw what happened to the lizard men.}
<C>__{feature flash}
<A>__{with a sudden thoughtful look, his head working.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{sue but that wasn't a team effort.}
<C>__{aura}
<D>__{i don't know these words what's a "team"?}
<A>__{flash just shakes his head. aura watches him a beat more, then reaches up and pulls down a curious gadget hanging above her seat. it's a transparent hood with strange fittings inside, not totally unlike a beauty shop hairdryer.}
<C>__{aura }
<D>__{telekinetic thought transfer.}
<P>__{(setting its dials)}
<D>__{i'm going to get together with prince barin in arboria and tell him i'm arriving. he's the one who'll help you.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{aura}
<D>__{because he does anything i ask. he loves me.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{you can really transfer your thoughts with that? like i could get in touch with dale?}
<C>__{aura}
<D>__{if i showed you how.}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{but i'm not going to.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{aura just gives him a look and laughs. flash stares at her a moment, then suddenly moves his hands sharply over the control panel. the craft hurtles into a violent dive. aura yells.}
<C>__{aura}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{aura drops the plastic hood, lunges to move. her own hands on the controls, but flash seizes her wrists.}
