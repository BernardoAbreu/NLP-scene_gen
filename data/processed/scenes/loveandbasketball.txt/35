<A>__{championship banners hang from the ceiling. twelve young women sit on the first two rows of bleachers. the eight upperclassmen kick back in the second row, comfortable, confident. monica and the three other freshmen sit in front of them, jiggling nervously. coach miller stands in front of the team.}
<C>__{coach miller}
<D>__{i don't know some of you very well yet, and you don't know me because i'm still being nice to you.}
<A>__{laughter from the upperclassmen.}
<C>__{coach miller }
<D>__{but my philosophy is simple. hard work and sacrifice. there's a lot of basketball history and pride here at usc, but just putting on the cardinal and gold doesn't make you a great player. hard work and sacrifice makes you a great player. what you were doesn't matter anymore. for the first time in your life, you won't be the best. you'll be going up against women that are bigger and stronger and better than you ever imagined. so the question is, how will you respond? well, your answer better be hard work and sacrifice because that's the only way you're gonna make it through. vince lombardi preached it and i teach it, "there is only one way to succeed at anything and that is to give everything."}
<A>__{coach miller pauses a moment to let her words sink in. monica glances at her fellow freshman for their reactions. like her, a lot of cockiness, a lot of fear.}
<C>__{coach miller }
<D>__{a few simple rules. eleven o'clock curfew, no exceptions. always be on time, no exceptions. attend every class, no exceptions. no drugs, no alcohol, no getting pregnant. and finally, respect yourselves, respect your coaches and respect your teammates, right sidra?}
<A>__{sidra, senior point guard, nods from the second row.}

<D>__{that's right, coach.}

<A>__{cree, junior forward, ducks her head sheepishly. coach miller smiles.}
<C>__{coach miller}
<D>__{but i guarantee you, if you work hard and sacrifice, all of you will be better basketball players and better people.}
<A>__{monica nods, accepting the challenge.}
