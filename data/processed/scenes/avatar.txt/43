<L>__{interior armor bay morning}
<A>__{jake and trudy enter the armor bay, passing tilt rotors under repair. there are the heavily armed scorpions as well as several sa 2 samson work horses outfitted with door guns and rocket pods.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you guys're packing some heavy ordinance.}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{yeah, `cause we're not the only thing flyin' around out there. or the biggest. i'm gonna need you on a door gun, i'm a man short.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{yeah, no problem.}
<A>__{she extends her fist and he taps it with his.}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{see ya on the flight line, zero nine.}
<P>__{(she points)}
<D>__{he's down there.}
<A>__{jake rolls his chair along the central gallery of the armor bay, passing rows of ampsuits standing in service racks. techs clamber over the `suits, loading ordinance with cranes and lifts. at the end of the row is a makeshift gym area. quaritch is bench pressing massive plates.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{this low gravity makes you soft.}
<P>__{(pushing the last rep)}
<D>__{you get soft, pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning.}
<A>__{quaritch racks the bar and sits up, sweating but not winded.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{i pulled your record, corporal. venezuela that was some mean bush. nothing like this here, though. you got heart kid, coming out here.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i figured just another hellhole.}
<A>__{quaritch chuckles appreciatively, claps him on the shoulder. the chief mechanic yells from the nearest ampsuit }
<C>__{mechanic}
<D>__{that servo's in, colonel, if you want to try it.}
<A>__{quaritch crosses to the `suit, with jake following.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{i was in first recon a few years ahead of you. more than a few. two tours in nigeria, not a scratch. i come out here and }
<A>__{he points to his scarred face.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{they could fix this if i rotated back. but you know what? i kinda like it. reminds me every day what's out there. besides, i can't leave }
<A>__{he looks out, as if he can see through the wall to the tree line.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{this is my war, here.}
<A>__{quaritch climbs the `suit and reaches into the cockpit, throwing some switches. the `suit's gas turbine spools up with a rising whine.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{the avatar program is a joke buncha limpdick scientists. but we have a unique opportunity here, you and i. a recon marine in an avatar body could get me the intel i need, on the ground, right in the hostiles' camp.}
<A>__{the whine is now a roaring whoosh as the `suit trembles with power. the air boils above the exhaust vents. quaritch reaches in and operates the controls, flexing one huge hand. he nods to the waiting mechanic }
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{looks good.}
<P>__{(to jake)}
<D>__{i need you to learn about these savages, gain their trust. find out how i can force their cooperation, or hit `em hard if they don't. maybe you can keep some of my boys from going home like you. or bagged and tagged.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{that sounds real good, colonel. so am i still with augustine?}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{on paper. you walk like one of her science pukes, you quack like one, but you report to me. can you do that for me?}
<A>__{jake nods. quaritch brings the `suit to life. he steps forward and pivots smoothly. he balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping the arms in strong, graceful arcs. jake realizes he is doing a wu shoo kata. a flawless display of strength and control. he's impressive, and jake is impressed. quaritch is the kind of man he respects focused, hard. determined.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{look, son i take care of my own. get me what i need, i will see you get your legs back when you rotate home. your real legs.}
<A>__{he raises the `suit's hand, and slams the canopy shut like the visor of a helmet. jake watches quaritch walk past, huge feet clanging kung! kung! kung!}
