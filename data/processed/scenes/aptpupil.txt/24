<A>__{dussander bursts through the door with the bundle. a single paw emerges from the corner of the blanket and flails at dussander, clawing him across the neck.}

<D>__{oww, you mother fucker.}
<A>__{they move across the room to the stove. with difficulty, dussander pulls open the oven door, revealing the glowing red interior. the animal screams and claws at dussander's neck and arms, escaping more and more from the blanket with every gyration of its body. with a mighty shove dussander plunges the cat toward the opening, but the animal braces its paws on the edge of the stove. the two are deadlocked. but dussander's hands are too close to the heat. he screams. his grip loosens just enough. with a desperate cry, the animal charges up dussander's body, over his head, and leaps to the floor. dussander dives after it.}

<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{subject is a young jewish girl, approximately sixteen years of age, no scars, no identifying marks, no known disabilities }
<A>__{inside the control room, a scientist monitors a volt meter, calling out the readings as dussander yells for the voltage to be increased. as the meter rises, the girl screams more violently. perhaps her eyes roll back, her tongue flutters in her mouth. through all of this, the scientists call out and the record heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity, voltage, etc. todd's eyes close. his breathing accelerates as does the motion of his hips until...}
