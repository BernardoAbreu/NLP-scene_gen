<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior truck stop day}
<A>__{rudy and ashley sit at a coffee shop booth. coats still on. big rigs bluster by on the highway outside. two untouched cups of coffee sit before them. she's watching him in silence.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i like your coat.}
<A>__{ashley says nothing. rudy looks at his own:}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{this this is just something they gave me at the door. wasn't snowing when we signed up, y'know?}
<A>__{ashley nods.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{how's your coffee?}
<A>__{ashley looks at it, like she's just realizing it's there. she lifts the cup, takes a sip. puts it down.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{rudy nods. silence again.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{gotta be ten degrees out there.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{radio said negative five.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{negative five?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i don't think it's negative five.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{radio said.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{wind chill. that's probably what they meant.}
<A>__{ashley nods. rudy bites his lip.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i was scared. scared you were gonna take one look at me and change your mind. scared i was walking into heartache. all those words... you put a picture in your mind of where they come from and when you see where maybe it's not the same as your picture.}
<A>__{he trails off.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{no, no }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{saw my outfit or something, my coat }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{no, hey, i like your coat }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{saw me }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{ashley, no. that was me, that's what i was scared of. i mean, be serious... i ain't exactly looking like mr. universe here.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{you are to me.}
<A>__{rudy goes silent. whoa. ashley considers.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{thought you wrote you had a mustache.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i can get another one going. y'know, hey, whatever you want me to }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{no, no, no. be like you want to be.}
<A>__{another awkward pause. rudy picks up a milk dispenser beside the coffee, puts it to his lips. it gives him a wide white mustache. he stares straight faced. ashley gives a bashful smile, covers it.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{do that again.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{what.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{smile.}
<A>__{ashley smiles again, blushing now.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{one more. smile. one more.}
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(trying not to)}
<D>__{no, c'mon }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i've been dreaming about that smile, ashley mercer. for a long time.}
<A>__{they stare across the table, drifting into one another's eyes.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{you're better than the picture in my mind, nick...}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you're real.}
<A>__{outside, another truck rumbles by, whipping up snow.}
