<L>__{exterior prairie day}
<A>__{kicking bird and dances with wolves are alone on a great sea of prairie. there's a little fire going. a sage hen is being roasted, but for some time we hear nothing but the light crackle of the fire. each man is preoccupied with his own thoughts, thoughts of the broken forest.}
<C>__{dances with wolves}
<D>__{you have asked me many times about the white people... you always ask how many more are coming.}
<A>__{dances with wolves looks at his friend and mentor.}
<C>__{dances with wolves}
<D>__{there will be a lot my friend... more than can be counted.}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{help me to know how many.}
<C>__{dances with wolves}
<D>__{like the stars.}
<A>__{this is what kicking bird wanted to know. and it hits him like a rock. kicking bird bows his head in thought while dances with wolves raises his. he never wanted to say this, he wishes it wasn't true.}
<C>__{dances with wolves}
<D>__{it makes me afraid for all the sioux.}
