<L>__{exterior box seat area day}
<A>__{mccall sits down in the same box as the last time. roper sits down next to him.}
<L>__{exterior track day}
<A>__{the horses go into the gate.}
<L>__{exterior box seat area day}
<A>__{mccall watches intently as the horses spring from the gate. (the track announcer's call plays over the scene.)}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{come on four horse! come on seven horse!}
<A>__{roper isn't watching the horse. he's watching mccall. watching him redirect all his pent up emotion. understanding exactly how he feels. mccall is screaming his head off.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{come on four seven... come on... come on... come on...}
<A>__{the horses cross the wire. the four and seven finish mid pack. mccall hangs his head in despair. he didn't give a shit about the race. he looks inconsolable.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{it might have happened no matter who was up there.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{bullshit! would it have happened to you?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{maybe... there's one thing you have to remember... you don't create the situations. you can only try to save people from them.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{i thought i could do it. i was so damn sure of myself. but i didn't know what to say. the words wouldn't come. my mouth turned to mush. you make it look so easy, roper. but it is not. it's not easy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{that it is.}
<A>__{a long silent beat.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{how many have you lost?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i look at it as how many i've saved. that's the way you've got to look at it.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{and what about the ones you don't save?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{you live with it... and they haunt you. it doesn't leave.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{and what if you can't live with it?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{you've got to decide that for yourself.}
<A>__{mccall squeezes his eyes closed. he can still see that vet falling to his death. roper can see mccall's pain.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i've lost three. one of them was my partner. i think about them every time i go into a situation.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{there's a million people in this city with all kinds of twisted shit going on in their heads, and the bitch of this job is that we expect to go out every day and do the impossible to somehow control all this craziness... and we can't.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{nobody's faulting you for this, mccall. my advice is you let yourself off the hook.}
<A>__{mccall hears him but is still undecided.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{i don't know... i don't know...}
<A>__{roper gets up, stands over mccall, puts a hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{let's get out of here.}
<A>__{mccall slowly gets up and they walk out.}
