<A>__{the yard is littered with toys. in the middle is a trampoline. he spots the figure climbing the trellis. shane runs, jumps onto the trampoline. he flies in the air and latches onto the figure. they both tumble to the ground. shane yanks off the dark figure's hood, revealing scott (16) a nervous teenager. he's dazed, but alright, wearing sharper image night vision goggles.}

<A>__{freaked, scott fumbles for his wallet and gives shane a twenty dollar bill.}
<C>__{shane }
<D>__{i meant push ups!}
<A>__{befuddled, scott starts to do lame push ups. shane grabs the back of scott's shirt, lifting him in the air, spinning him away from the house like a marionette. scott runs off, calling out from across the street.}

<D>__{... i will call you, zoe!}
<A>__{zoe storms inside. shane stands there, fuming. the alarm's still blaring. the window of the house next door opens: a korean couple, the chuns, pop their heads out. they're arguing with each other in korean. shane addresses them, in perfect korean with subtitles:}

<A>__{mr. chun tosses him the troll doll and slam their window shut. shane's about to head inside, he pulls a tiny camera phone from his pocket, and snaps a shot of the chun's car in their driveway.}
