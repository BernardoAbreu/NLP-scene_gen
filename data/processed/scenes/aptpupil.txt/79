<A>__{a shaft of dull light from the kitchen cuts across the cellar floor, revealing archie's slain body. an expanding pool of blood seeps out from his head. as the door upstairs opens wider, the light falls on todd standing over archie, the shovel still in his hands, his face spattered with blood. the todd we knew only a minute ago has been transformed. he stares up at dussander, not with the eyes of a boy, but with those of a man. a man who can no longer be saved.}
