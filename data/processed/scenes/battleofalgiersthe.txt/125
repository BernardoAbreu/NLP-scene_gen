<L>__{124 ambulance. outside inside. evening.}
<A>__{in the driver's cab, there are two algerian boys. their hair is curly, their shirts old and torn. they are sweating; their eyes wide open, staring. the one who is driving barely reaches the height of the steering wheel. he clutches it desperately. the other has a machine gun. he makes a remark in arabic shouting to be heard above the siren. the driver takes a hand off the steering wheel, places it on the dashboard, and tries all the switches until he finds the one for the headlights. the high beams. the other, meanwhile, is now on his knees on the seat. he is leaning out the open window to his waist, and he begins to shoot.}
