<L>__{interior cobo hall auditorium night}
<A>__{the lights are out. the lighters have been lit. the crowds' roar is deafening. jam, hawk, trip, and lex plow their way through the throngs and head straight for the front row just as simple simon takes the stage.}
<C>__{simple simon}
<D>__{you wanted the best! and you got the best! the hottest band in the world... kiss!!!}
<A>__{simple simon runs from the stage just as the opening chords to detroit rock city begin. on the beat, boom, fireworks shoot from the floor alighting the place. kiss takes the stage descending on hydraulic elevators. on jam, hawk, trip, and lex they're seeing god! the show is spectacular. the costumes. the make up. the blitzkrieg of pyrotechnics. the flashing kiss sign. ace's smoking guitar. gene's spewing fire. paul's rockin' vocals. peter's kick ass beat. then, something really weird happens. the crowd behind the boys heaves forward. jam is pushed like a twig in a flood and over the shoulders of those in front of him. purely by accident, he is thrown onto the stage landing on his stomach between paul and gene. just before peter's drum solo is about to start. gene, paul, and ace silence their instruments. peter throws his drumstick into the air intending to catch it when it comes down. but the sight of jam landing on the stage distracts him. all is mute as peter misses the drumstick. it hits the outside edge of one of the drums. thinking fast, jam grabs one of his drumsticks out of his sock and tosses it to peter. it tumbles through the air in slow motion with a low, whooping, helicopter sound. we see the word "mystery" clearly as it twirls. instantly, it's caught in peter criss's hand and he brings it down on his drum not missing a beat. the song resumes with all its fury as peter's drum kit ascends on a hydraulic platform. jam scrambles from the stage and leaps back into the audience barely missing the claws of some security guards. the four friends pound on each other with unbridled, teenage exuberance. will it ever get any better than this?}
