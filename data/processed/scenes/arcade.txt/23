<B>__{static.}
<A>__{late night t.v. static, filling up the entire screen. we pull back, revealing a television...and further back until we see alex crouched behind it in silhouette. she's fiddling with wires back there and... blink! suddenly the slip stream logo appears on the t.v. screen with nifty computer graphics. she's just hooked up the home version of arcade. alex moves back to the front of the set. alex's room is her haven, a virtual library, filled with books which she loses herself in. they're stacked everywhere. and puzzles too. half assembled jig saws. intricate things. an escher printerior the descendants of rubik's cube. boxes within boxes. this is alex's life, what she retreats to.}

<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{kiss reality goodbye.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{arcade's face spins away, to be replaced by a pixel rendered image of alex, dressed in battle gear. video alex sets her thrasher on the ground and mounts it.}
