<A>__{the texas plains, horizon to horizon, nothing but the browns and ochres of earth and the blue and violet of the sky. the sheer scope of it sinks in: the blank slate of nature, the absence of man. on the screen superimpose:}
<D>__{marfa, texas, 1993.}
<B>__{credits begin.}
<A>__{a plume of dust comes into frame. the dust is from a truck, orange and white and violet, with "fedex" blazoned across the side. the truck turns into a collection of ramshackle world war ii era quonset huts and outbuildings. around the outbuildings are large sculptures of wood and metal.}
<L>__{exterior quonset hut day}
<A>__{the door is opened by a woman in her late twenties. hair pulled back, casual, an artist. she hands the driver a fedex box which is decorated with a drawing of two angel wings. the driver has a hand held computer; a portable printer dangles from his belt. the driver scans the package with his hand held computer, prints out a label and sticks it on the box, ready to go. but something on the box catches her eye. she wants it back. he glances at his watch. she draws rings around the wings, uniting them. she gives the box to the driver, then hands him a cup of coffee. they've done this before. he takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck. he jumps in and heads back onto the plains.}
<L>__{exterior fedex office midland odessa night hours later}
<A>__{the driver jams the distinctive angel wing box on top of a dolly and loads it into a container with clear plastic sides. a female loader slaps a large bar code label on the container, scans it, then pulls the container across a belt of rollers onto a larger truck. the doors of the truck close. the latch slams down. a forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737.}

<A>__{the 737 lands.}
<L>__{exterior superhub night minutes later}
<A>__{one of a seemingly endless line of fedex planes, our 737 taxis to a gate at the fedex superhub. the hub is a vast living organism loud, complex, overwhelming, as much a symbol of modern life as was the factory in modern times. five thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected activity inside three vast hangers brightly lit. hundreds of forklifts and cargo pullers dart about, their headlights crisscrossing like a laser show. loaders quickly roll the container onto a forklift.}
<L>__{interior memphis superhub night}
<A>__{the forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a loading belt, where our box is spilled into a mississippi river of packages, hundreds of thousands of them, all shapes and sizes, from shoe boxes to engine blocks. large mechanical arms divert the immense flow of workers at dozens of stations. the packages surge and move. the workers place the packages label side up on new belts, where they're scanned by laser readers. picking up speed our box is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts. the box ends up in a much larger container labeled cdg.}

<D>__{it's pretty. who is it from?}

<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{my guess is we're talking fuel filters here, fernando. the gas is dirty, these jitneys get in the mountains, their engines cut out.}
<C>__{fernando}
<D>__{that could lose us half an hour.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{easy. each way.}

<C>__{chuck}

<C>__{aleksei}
<D>__{six kilometers. four miles.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{so how are we going to get this place shaped up?}
<A>__{there's a muttered chorus of answers.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{there's only one way. we have to work together. every one of us depends on everyone else. if one package is late, we are all late. if one truck misses the deadline, we all miss the deadline. let's start by taking a look around.}
<A>__{chuck leads his team through the sorting area. yuri squeezes right next to him, ostentatiously carrying a clipboard. chuck stops.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{here, this table is too far from the wall. packages can slip down...like...}
<P>__{(pulls out a package from behind a table)}
<D>__{...this.}
<A>__{he hefts the package, as if trying to guess what's inside.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what could be in here? let's say one of you sent it. could be the closing papers on your dacha, could be a toy for your grandson's birthday, could be a kidney to keep your mother alive. i don't think you want your mother's kidney to end up behind a table.}
<A>__{the sorter shoves the table against the wall. yuri says something to the translator.}
<C>__{translator}
<D>__{he says they have been very busy. it is hard to get good employees. he is sure you understand.}
<A>__{wrong answer: chuck glances sharply at yuri. aleksei appears with a cellular phone.}
<C>__{aleksei}
<D>__{phone call. malaysia.}
<A>__{chuck takes the phone, opening his bag as he does so.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{kamal? right. i'm getting them.}
<A>__{he pulls out a set of blueprints and tacks them to a bulletin board as he talks.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i'm looking at the blueprints of k.l. right now. the belts are too small for the sorters. yeah, sometimes you never see what's right in front of your face. look, it's }
<A>__{chuck keeps an eye on what is going on in the warehouse. then he notices something over by one of the trucks.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(to a loader)}
<D>__{hold it! hazardous material needs its own container!}
<P>__{(back on the phone)}
<D>__{ three in the afternoon there, right? that gives you five hours until the sweep comes through. do the sort by hand tonight, then put in a new feeder belt, say a twenty four incher. yes, overtime is authorized.}
<A>__{he hangs up the phone. he turns to the crew.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i'm going out on every route, i'm going to work every job here, until i know enough to help you. that's it.}
<A>__{the crew disperses back to work. chuck and aleksei walk toward the office. they've done this before. chuck lets a corner of his command persona slip.}
<C>__{aleksei}
<D>__{it's bad.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{worse than warsaw.}
<C>__{aleksei}

<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you sorted your packages before you left. none of the other drivers did.}
<A>__{the translator and lev exchange a few words.}
<C>__{translator}
<D>__{he says he wants to be organized. do packages in order.}
<A>__{chuck looks at lev with respect. right answer.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{so how come the other drivers haven't left yet?}
<A>__{the translator asks lev, who looks at him as if he is crazy, then snorts an answer. the translator blushes.}
<C>__{translator}
<D>__{he says he is a very rude fellow }
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{tell me exactly what he said.}
<C>__{translator}
<D>__{he says why don't his farts smell sweet?}
<A>__{chuck grins. lev shrugs and says something else.}
<C>__{translator}
<D>__{he says that's just the way it is.}

<D>__{those damn northern lights.}
<A>__{just then the lights go off. for a moment everything is darkness. then a small light switches on. chuck has a headlamp on. he gets up, heads into the bathroom. we stay in the bedroom. after only a moment, the light reemerges. it heads over to his bag. we go with it. chuck takes out a roll of toilet paper. the guy is prepared for anything. he goes into the bathroom, closes the door. the lights come back on just as the phone rings. we hear scuffling sounds on the other side of the door. chuck charges out, holding up his pants. grabs the phone.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{hello? great. try it.}
<A>__{he waits. we hear an answering machine.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{this is kelly, leave me a message and i will call you back soon as i can.}
<A>__{this is not what chuck wanted to hear.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{kelly, damn, look, this is chuck. i'm going to be a little late. well, more than a little. i had to go to russia. couldn't be helped. could you call and cancel the trip? look, we'll sail the keys in march. it's better then anyway. i will be back before christmas. i promise. i think. i mean, i will. i, uh }

<A>__{chuck has made a neat stack of fedex boxes under some palm trees at the rim of the beach. he examines the angel wing drawing with passing curiosity, then puts it on the stack. chuck takes off his life jacket, sits down in the shade, makes himself comfortable, and waits.}

<D>__{all right, guys. i'm here. check the gps, get moving.}
<L>__{exterior beach night}
<A>__{the full moon shines a ghostly light on the beach. trees cast moon shadows on the sand. chuck seems very, very alone. we hear from the dark thickets a strange noise. rustling in the leaves. something crashing in the trees, or is it a wave? a jolt of adrenaline courses through chuck's body. he lurches to his feet. we hear the noises again. chuck edges toward the rocks at the barb of the hook. keeping his eye on the thicket, he bends down and picks up a stone. his first weapon. in the rocks he finds a piece of driftwood. he picks it up in his other hand. he backs between two rocks and stands facing the thicket, every sense alert. a cloud passes over the moon. the shadow streaks across chuck's anxious face.}
<L>__{exterior beach morning}
<A>__{the morning tide is coming in. we follow the tide as it laps amidst the rocks and finds chuck, staring out to sea. the empty sea.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{where the fuck are you?}
<A>__{but now he is really thirsty. we walk with chuck up the beach. beneath the palms he sees a couple of coconuts. he picks one of them up and studies it. it's heavy, almost the size of a volleyball. how to get in it? he throws it down on a rock. the coconut just bounces off. he wedges the coconut between two rocks, then throws a rock down on it. it bounces off. he throws down a bigger rock. it smashes on the rocks and chips. chuck picks up the rock. ow! where the rock had chipped the edge is sharp. it cuts him.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{sonofabitch.}
<A>__{the blood stains the rock a bright red. chuck sucks on his finger, then he gets an idea the same idea primitive man first got when he discovered stone tools. he picks up the rock, test the edge. sharp really sharp. he throws another rock down, but it doesn't break. he picks up another rock and strikes the first one. then again, harder. and again. a large flake shoots off. this edge is even sharper. he has a knife. opening the coconut series of shots chuck uses the stone knife to saw at the coconut. no luck. chuck clumsily sharpens a stick with the sharp rock. chuck brings the sharpened stick down hard on the coconut, but the stick slides off, sending the coconut rolling away. chuck positions the stick, pointed end up, in a hole, then slams the coconut down hard on it. success! the green nut of the coconut splits. the brown inner nut is free! he smashes the nut with a rock, but ow! he hits his hand! chuck licks his fingers, but he is so thirsty there's no more saliva. he smashes again. the shell breaks to smithereens. coconut milk splashes everywhere.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{that was smart, really smart.}
<A>__{rotating a nut along its axis and carefully moving his fingers out of the way, he smashes the nut again. the shell splits! the precious liquid splashes out. left inside is a swallow or two, which chuck laps up eagerly. the milky white liquid dribbles down his face.}

<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{okay, do the math. maybe they know where you are within, say 500 miles. that's a circle with an area of, uh, pi r squared. so, uh, 250,000 times three point one four, that's about 800,000 square miles. three times the size of texas.}

<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{thirsty.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{no water, no work.}
<A>__{chuck tries another tack. sweet reason.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{okay look, i know you're tired, i know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{do too much, i will die.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{do too little you'll die.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{going to die anyway.}
<A>__{that stops goodchuck for a moment.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{okay, look have an extra swallow.}
<A>__{he holds up the pathetic little jar with its few teaspoons of murky water.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{no more water, you said.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{take it.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{take it, damn it.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{wilson, do you believe this? take the damn water.}
<A>__{slowly chuck gets up, lifts up the water jar, and takes a swallow. then another.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{stop. enough.}
<A>__{then another.}
<L>__{exterior raft day later}
<A>__{chuck works to braid a new rope. he is focused, concentrating as hard as he can, but everything is slow and hard and he's weak and clumsy. he tests the rope, but it doesn't hold.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{think. got to use something else.}
<A>__{he gets an idea, starts to pull the signal kite in.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{if they can't see you, what's the point?}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{survive today, that's the pointerior}
<A>__{the kite rope is much thinner than the rope he had used to tie the logs, but it's all he has. he ties the log with the kite rope. exhausted, he lies back down.}
<L>__{exterior raft night}
<A>__{the moon is full. the waves cast off shadows on the ocean. chuck is staring into the sky, trying to find a star to navigate by.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{polaris, where are you? maybe i'm too far south.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{you don't know where you are. you missed the shipping lanes.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{moon's too bright.}
<A>__{we hear the fraying sound again.}
<L>__{exterior raft day}
<A>__{chuck saws at the outer log with his stone knife. across the water comes a storm. we can see it like a waterfall moving toward us.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{you're putting off the inevitable.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{i'm putting it off.}
<A>__{he looks at the deteriorating rope, at the rotting sail.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{that's what's happening to you.}
<A>__{chuck pushes the outer log away, then takes the loose rope and begins to lash it around the center logs.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{you're rotting away.}
<A>__{the raft is rocking. the waves are stronger. it's hard to tie the logs together. rain falls like a sheet on chuck.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{get water!}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{fix raft first.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{water water water }
<A>__{chuck works frantically in the rain, trying to tie the rope. finally he does. then he scrambles for his water collecting funnel, struggles to pull it up. one corner is stuck and collapses. desperately he rights it, pulls the funnel up. drops begin to run down the sides and collect in the jar. soaked, chuck stares at the water as it rises. then the rain stops. we see the line of rain recede away from chuck, spattering the ocean. but all around him the ocean is calm again. and out comes the sun.}
<L>__{exterior ocean day}
<A>__{the raft floats on quiet seas. the sky is blue, with few high cirrus clouds so motionless they seem pasted on. chuck lies on the raft, sick and weak. suddenly, from the depths beside him, silently rises a huge shape. a sperm whale, still mainly submerged. the blow hole is near chuck, wet and pulsing like giant lips. the eye of the whale is only a few feet away. it looks upon chuck out of an intelligence deep and alien. he slowly comes to his knees and stares at it. the blow hole opens and whoosh, out shoots a geyser of fine spray which settles on chuck in a mist. the whale rises farther, dwarfing the raft. from the whale comes a deep sound like a foghorn. startled, chuck jumps back, rocking the raft. he catches himself, slowly reaches out and touches the whale. the whale blows again, drenching chuck in more spray. chuck touches the whale again.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{you like that?}
<A>__{very slowly it drifts along with the raft.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{lost your mate?}
<A>__{we look right into the whale's eye. beneath the surface we can see the huge jaws open and close.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{you're beautiful. marry me.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{you idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.}
<A>__{very slowly the whale moves ahead of the raft, its vast body passing chuck.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{no, don't go. look, i've got fish.}
<A>__{chuck rips a fillet off the line and throws it in front of the whale, which ignores it.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{please don't dive. please.}
<A>__{the whale slowly sinks, then suddenly arches its huge back and heads straight for the bottom. for a moment, all that remains are the flukes, black and vertical against the dark blue sky. with one swoop, those flukes could destroy chuck and his raft. but they don't do anything except slowly sink. then it is gone. we are on chuck's face as he stares at where the whale had been, the surface marked only by a ring of concentric ripples that reach out and gently rock the raft.}
<L>__{exterior ocean day}
<A>__{chuck checks the water. it is green and full of floaties. it looks awful. he takes the jug, puts it to his mouth, and drinks. instantly he throws up back into the jug, barely keeps from dropping it.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{look what you've done.}
<A>__{he dips his hand into the ocean, splashes some sea water on his face, splutters it out, then licks his lips. he is so thirsty. he looks at the water jug, full now with his own vomit, turns away, begins to work on the sea anchor again. but the work makes him even thirstier. he looks at the jug again. picks it up. takes a long drink.}
<L>__{exterior ocean day}
<A>__{the fish return. chuck gets up with his spear, then puts it down.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{can't kill another one. can't. can't kill my friends anymore.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{you fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{why do they have to die for me?}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{they'd eat you if they could. they're laughing at you. listen.}
<A>__{chuck listens. doesn't hear anything.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{got to eat.}
<A>__{chuck picks up the spear, stabs it, misses. suddenly he has a fish on the end of the spear. it struggles, he scoops it onto the raft, brutally pounds on its head, twists the stone knife into its spine. the struggling stops. chuck looks at the dead fish and begins to sob.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{i am so sorry.}
<A>__{he cries uncontrollably. as he cries he cuts off the head, pulls out the eyeballs, and eats each one. then he sucks the marrow out of the head. then takes the heart and eats that. then eats the liver. as he is chewing, he cuts the meat into strips. when he is done, he takes the backbone, breaks it, and sucks on it. fish scales shine in his hair, blood covers his chest.}
<L>__{exterior ocean night}
<A>__{the raft rocks gently. chuck looks up. the strips of fish are glowing. so is the deck where he killed the fish. he reaches out to touch the fish strips. his hand is glowing too.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i'm an angel.}
<A>__{suddenly he sees other lights. a ship. a ship is out there. and he hears it, a humming in deep register. he waves his hands. he yells.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{here! here!}
<A>__{his voice cracks, we can barely hear it over the ocean. the lights move on.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no...no...no...}
<A>__{his raft is rocked by the wake, rocked hard. chuck is thrown into the water! he comes to the surface, sputtering. where is the raft? he looks one way, then another. darkness. this is the worst. he turns again in the water. there, dimly, he can see the glow from the fish he killed. the glow saves his life. he swims toward it. he pulls himself back on the raft. he lies there exhausted, the glow from the phosphorescence casting a greenish light on his face.}
<L>__{exterior ocean day}
<A>__{clouds are building up. in the distance lightning flashes. the clouds come closer. little bits of electricity jump off the mast. saint elmos fire jumps around chuck's hand. fascinated, he holds out his hand. the fire jumps from his hand to the mast. suddenly lightning shoots from the sky and strikes the ocean! a huge spout of water explodes like a depth charge. the crack is intense, then rolls away. chuck stares, then realizes the danger and throws himself down on the raft. suddenly a wall of rain sweeps over him and the ocean begins to roll. the thunder is deafening. lightning flashes bursts through the rain.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{sea anchor! let out the sea anchor!}
<A>__{frantic, chuck lets out the sea anchor as the raft scuds down a huge wave. the anchor catches, slowing the raft so that it rides the wave down. the waves come at him high as houses. the raft rides up one side, then plunges down the nexterior all chuck can do is hold on.}
<L>__{exterior ocean day}
<A>__{the storm has passed. the raft floats on big dark rollers. we hear the chirping and squeaking of dolphins. they come close to the raft. chuck watches them play. then realizes they are chasing his fish. they drive them along, into the path of another dolphin, who darts in and rips into the dorado, turning the water around the raft into churning, bloody foam.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{he takes his oar and begins beating the water. the killing continues.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you fucking murderers!}
<A>__{suddenly the water is still. one dolphin sticks its head out of the water and stares at chuck, squeaking. another dolphin lifts its head up, then another. they squeak to each other, clearly communicating and talking about chuck.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i know you're talking about me!}
<A>__{he splashes the water with his oar. they dive, then jump into the air, squeaking as they go.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(very softly)}
<D>__{take me with you.}
<A>__{they're gone.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{why me? why me, god?}
<A>__{he begins to laugh.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{listen to this, wilson.}
<P>__{(deep voice: god)}
<D>__{because you piss me off.}
<L>__{exterior ocean day}
<A>__{chuck tries to stretch with some simple yoga. each movement takes forever. he rolls over onto his stomach and tries to do a pushup. he can't. collapses onto the raft.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{you're falling apart.}
<A>__{tries to do another pushup. can't.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{first you eat your fat, then you eat your muscle.}
<A>__{he rolls over.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{then you eat your mind.}
<A>__{he looks at the ocean. they're in a line of garbage, a thick slick of debris dumped off of ships.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{roll on you deep and dark blue ocean roll.}
<A>__{he closes his eyes. after a minute they come open.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{i'm late, i'm late, for a very important date.}
<A>__{they slowly close again.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{i'm lost. goodbye.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{his eyes come open again.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{look, just slip off the raft. the ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm. take a little swim. sleep.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{you quitter you quitter you quitter.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{the sea is lovely, dark and deep.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{but i have promises to keep.}
<P>__{(rolls over)}
<D>__{and miles to go before i sleep.}
<P>__{(props himself up)}
<D>__{and miles to go before i sleep.}
<P>__{(purpose now)}
<D>__{got to fix the sea anchor. use the sail.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{if i don't have a sea anchor i will capsize.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{die tomorrow or die today.}
<A>__{he hums beethoven's fifth. ba ba ba bum.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{that's death knocking, knocking on your door. crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{grow up, stop being such a baby. other people get through a lot worse.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{yeah, sure, what?}
<A>__{he hums to himself, begins to sing, beatles.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{i'm so tired, my mind is on the blink...}
<A>__{he pulls in the loose sea anchor rope, which is covered with barnacles. he scrapes the barnacle off the rope into the water jug, then sips it. the sun is setting, huge rays shoot out across the sky. out of the empty ocean the dorados suddenly appear, leaping flashes of silver right by the raft. one dorado swims right by the raft, broadside. chuck looks at it, uncomprehending. then slowly reaches for his spear.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{what? are you sacrificing yourself for me?}
<A>__{carefully he comes to his feet, then shoots the spear into the fish. flapping and struggling, it lands on the deck. chuck pounces on it.}
<L>__{exterior raft night moments later}
<A>__{he cuts it open. the other dorados ram the raft in fury, like a lynch mob.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{damn it! i had to do it!}
<A>__{the banging continues.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{i'm sorry!}
<A>__{he concentrates on his work, then sits back on his heels in amazement. there's another fish inside. he holds that fish up, stares at it, then cuts it open. there's a smaller fish inside it.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{i know there's a moral here, god, but right now i'm just going to eat.}
<A>__{he pops out an eyeball, then another, and crunches them between his teeth. he takes the heart and liver, starts to eat, then stops.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{forgot to say grace. sorry mom.}
<A>__{he struggles to remember.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{bless us o lord, and these thy gifts and christ and the bounty about to receive, or something...amen.}
<A>__{he eats them.}
<L>__{exterior raft next morning}
<A>__{chuck splashes sea water on his face. adjusts the water still.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{please don't leak. please.}
<A>__{chuck picks up the smallest fish. it's half digested. he washes it in the ocean, trigger fish come up and nibble at his fingers.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{don't look at me. it was that dorado.}
<A>__{he cuts the small fish and hangs it on the stays.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{you know, wilson, every now and then we should say thank you. thank you god.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{thank you for fucking up my life.}
<A>__{suddenly something bumps the raft. hard. then again.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{not again.}
<A>__{fins cut the water. sharks. a big hammerhead bumps the raft. badchuck hums the theme from "jaws." chuck takes his spear stabs at the shark.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{he's going to get you, going to get you...}
<A>__{another one circles in, bumps the raft.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{get away from me!}
<A>__{the shark circles again, that big hammerhead like a nightmare.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{get him get him get him.}
<A>__{he stabs at it with his spear. he might as well have stabbed concrete. the shark circle, chuck stabs again. but the shark is gone.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{where are you? where are you?}
<A>__{stabs again and again at the empty ocean.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{stop! you're using energy. move slowly. be patient.}
<A>__{chuck kneels, wavering, on the raft. the ocean is calm. suddenly, bump. the raft tilts. chuck hangs on. then a shark appears, just out of spear range. its lifeless black eyes seem to stare right through chuck. if the dorado was a gift from god, this is a message from hell. then the shark is gone.}
<L>__{exterior raft day moments later}
<A>__{chuck lies back on the raft. he is humming.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{what are you smiling about? they'll be back.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{i'm dancing on the roof of the peabody hotel. with kelly.}
<A>__{he smiles at the thought.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{the music ends. we go back to the table. the waiters have brought dinner. new york strip with bordelaise sauce. mushrooms in brown gravy. roasted potatoes with garlic and rosemary. green beans with almonds. fresh biscuits and cornbread, dripping with butter. a nice salad with ranch dressing. a jumbo shrimp cocktail.}
<A>__{thinks about that, it spoils the picture.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{no shrimp.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{we eat.}
<A>__{he closes his eyes. this is the greatest fantasy.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<P>__{(as the waiter)}
<D>__{for dessert, we have pecan pie a la mode, we have a double chocolate cake with creme anglaise, we have a nice pear torte, fresh key lime pie, or perhaps if you care to wait a few minutes, a grand marnier souffle?}
<A>__{chuck thinks over the options, thinking of each one.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{why, bring them all, bring them all.}
<A>__{he rolls over. there, square in his vision, is a ship, its form coming in and out of a low haze. chuck jumps to his feet. waves. screams.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{here! over here!}
<A>__{the ship moves on. we can see the decks the rigging, the vastness of it. chuck realizes he is naked. struggles to pull on the remains of his pants finally holds them like a diaper with one hand as he continues to wave. on the ship no one is to be seen. it is a spooky sight. the big tanker moves on. we are on chuck's face. passed up again. then he realizes what is about to happen. he throws out the sea anchor. he throws himself onto the raft and grips it as tight as he can, wiggles his feet into the ropes.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{oh, shiiiittt!}
<A>__{then comes the wake of the ship. it rocks the raft like a piece of flotsam. the raft rides high up on the wave, then shoots down it, but the sea anchor holds, and the raft slows and rides along with the wave. and then the sea is calm again. slowly chuck sinks to his knees. his hand lets loose his pants. he lies down on the raft and imagines the conversation with the ship's captain.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{permission to come aboard, sir. chuck captain permission granted.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{may i ask, where are you bound? chuck captain san francisco. and you?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{as it happens, i'm headed for frisco myself. chuck captain would you do us the honor of joining us? we're just sitting down at mess. pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh baked bread, apple pie...}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no please, join me. some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.}
<A>__{the depression comes back again.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{they're never going to see you. you're just another piece of trash in the ocean.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{they're on autopilot.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{they're always on autopilot. or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave. they'll never see you.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{damn it! don't be so negative!}
<A>__{chuck picks up wilson.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{wilson, what's your story?}
<A>__{he holds wilson close to his chest.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{i float. you sink. end of story.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{i'm serious. i'm always going on about me, me, me. enough about me. your turn.}

<D>__{it's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{he lies on the raft and holds wilson close. we move up until we see }
<L>__{exterior ocean aerial evening}
<A>__{chuck lying curled up on the raft, wilson cradled in his arms, and all around the vast empty ocean.}
<L>__{exterior ocean next morning}
<A>__{chuck slowly wakes up. sets wilson aside.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{don't shirk, don't procrastinate, don't be lazy. we're okay today. we're okay today.}
<A>__{and the other chuck begins to laugh.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{the laughter goes on.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{shut the fuck up! i mean it.}
<A>__{he stands up and checks the horizon.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{what's so damn funny?}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{you are.}
<A>__{suddenly chuck sees something on the horizon. a bank of clouds. a cone of land. he squints, stares again. the clouds part. it looks like his island. chuck doesn't know whether to feel joy or despair.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{look again, asshole. it's a mirage.}
<A>__{chuck squints.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{it's real.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{nothing out there but ocean.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{let's get a second opinion. wilson? what do you see?}
<A>__{chuck picks up the soccer ball, holds it up, and stares out at...ocean.}
<L>__{exterior raft day later}
<A>__{chuck slowly writes on the sail.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{chuck noland. born october 8, 1958. died pick a date july 11, 1998. and now the epitaph. met deadlines. kept appointments. lost without a trace.}
<A>__{he sits back, looks at the mock headstone.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{what did it matter if fedex was five minutes late one day? the next day we just start over again.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{it matters. we do the best we can, that's all we have.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{then we've just got shit.}
<A>__{he goes on writing.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i am writing this to remind myself to live a better life. if i am lost, perhaps you who find this will be instructed to live a better live yourself. live each day. love your children. don't take anyone for granted.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{is that it? life is a fucking disney movie?}
<A>__{the waves begin to grow, the ocean turns a slate gray. far above him, great frigate birds circle. suddenly one dives on a booby which has caught a fish. the great frigate bird swoops all around the booby until, panicked, it drops the fish, which plummets toward the sea. with a graceful dive, the huge bird grabs the fish and then soars up on a thermal, high into the sky. lightning flashes back and forth across the horizon, which is turning black and dark. thunder rolls.}
<L>__{exterior raft night}
<A>__{the raft goes up and down huge waves. every few seconds lightning flashes, illuminating the raft and chuck holding desperately to it, his eyes wild with fear.}
<L>__{exterior raft morning}
<A>__{the waves continue. chuck holds on, his face pale.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{you can't make it.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{shut up. i don't feel like dying today.}
<L>__{exterior ocean day later}
<A>__{the sky clears. the waves are still big. the fish are back. and then come the sharks, cutting through the water. chuck can't get up to get his spear, he just has to watch as blood darkens the water. and then the sharks are gone. chuck comes to his knees slowly, then a big wave hits. wilson is swept into the ocean! for a moment chuck is uncomprehending. he watches as wilson slowly floats away.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{please, no sharks.}
<A>__{then he dives in to the water! swims frantically after wilson. wilson floats away from him. he swims, but he's so weak. finally he gets to wilson. he reaches out, but only pushes the ball farther away. it bobs on the waves. chuck treads water, exhausted. where is the raft?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{jesus. jesus. jesus.}
<A>__{then he turns back the other way. the raft has drifted by him. he can go after wilson, or he can go after the raft.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{shit! wilson!}
<A>__{he swims toward the raft, barely moving. no matter how hard he swims, the raft seems to recede from him. finally he reaches it, hangs on the side, breathing hard, choking, crying. he struggles to pull himself on board. but he is weak, so weak. he can't do it. summoning some primitive reserve of strength, he tries again. this time he slides on. he lies on the raft, panting. then with all his strength he pulls himself to his feet, holds on to the mast, scans the ocean for wilson.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{wilson!}
<A>__{nothing but waves. this is too much. chuck starts to cry.}
<L>__{exterior raft day later}
<A>__{chuck takes a swallow of water, washes it around in his mouth, then swallows. with his wet tongue he licks his cracked lips. the sun breaks through the clouds. with what strength he has left, chuck raises the canopy, fastens it. he sits in the meager shade, his head between his knees. closes his eyes. just for a minute.}
<L>__{exterior ocean day later}
<A>__{a different sort of shadow crosses chuck's face. he opens his eyes. there, riding right beside his raft, is a ship, a huge rusty tanker. someone shouts down in a language we don't understand. chuck sits up, can't believe it. struggles to cover himself.}

<A>__{chuck is lifted up the rusted steel side of the boat in a jacob's ladder.}
<L>__{exterior ship day later}
<A>__{chuck steps on board, can't support himself. the crew gathers around. none of them speak english, but there is a spontaneous outburst of human connection. one man brings some water. another a blanket. another some warm tea. chuck sits there, shivering now.}

<D>__{thank you. oh thank you.}
<A>__{deliriously happy. delirious.}
<L>__{interior u.s. naval hospital hawaii}
<A>__{a cavernous hanger sized ward brightly lit and filled with row upon row of hospital beds, each with its table, side chair, and lamp, each with a stainless steel bedpan and neatly folded sheets and blankets stacked ready to use, and each completely empty. except for one. and on that bed we see chuck, in a blue hospital gown. an iv drips into his arm. he plays idly with the remote control of the bed. he raises the head, then the foot. he pushes another button and the knee rest bends the bed again. a doctor enters, carrying a thick chart. chuck gives him a big manic grin. malcolm macdowell in "a clockwork orange."}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{my favorite doctor. what's the verdict?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{under the circumstances your overall health is good. those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.}
<A>__{he checks his blood work records.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{hemoglobin's 10.8 you're anemic, that's why we're giving you iron. potassium's low we're giving you an electrolyte solution with your iv. sodium's over 150, way too high. you may experience swelling in your extremities as you rehydrate and discharge the salt. in spite of your dietary deficiencies there's no sign of mental deterioration.}
<A>__{chuck has been trying not to laugh. now he can't stop himself.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{what's so funny.}
<A>__{chuck can't seem to help laughing at everything.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{sorry...sorry... why do my joints still ache?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{dehydration. vitamin deficiency. protein deficiency. any or all of the above.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{all i ate was fish. that's solid protein.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{protein digestion is very costly in water usage.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{which i didn't have.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{and fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient. so you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat. luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some vitamin c, so you didn't get scurvy.}
<A>__{chuck laughs again.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i am one lucky guy.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self reproach. it's almost like schizophrenia. different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{but all that's behind me. i'm fine now.}
<A>__{he starts to laugh again.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{if you say you are.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i most definitely say i am.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{doctor hegel tells me he discussed the vietnam pow syndrome with you.}
<A>__{chuck stifles his laughter.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{yes, yes he did.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{you are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{not to mention on me.}
<A>__{the laughter again. unsettling.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{you sure you don't want some counseling?}
<A>__{chuck gives his biggest smile.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{doc, i'm not on the island. i'm not on the raft. i'm alive. i'm so glad to be back, i can't tell you. i just want out of here.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{well, when that iv runs out, you're through with us. just the dentist tomorrow.}

<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{hello? hello?}
<A>__{for some reason he can't keep himself from laughing. he covers the mouthpiece and laughs. and then we hear a dial tone, harsh, mechanical, final.}

<A>__{we can see chuck inside, staring at the phone.}
<L>__{interior phone cubicle minutes later}
<A>__{we hear a faint persistent hum. chuck looks around, trying to locate the sound. he looks up, focuses on the fluorescent light, that background sound he can no longer tune out, then picks up the phone again.}

<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{two valium and the rolling stones. that ring a bell?}
<A>__{there's a long silence. then we hear stan's voice.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{god damn! god damn! chuck, it's you!}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{it's me.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{you're fucking dead!}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i'm most definitely not dead. and as i recall, you're the sick fucker.}
<A>__{chuck begins to laugh, a little too loud, a little too shrill. he's on a high.}
<L>__{exterior hawaii beach restaurant}
<A>__{a terrace by the ocean. tables filled with diners. food being delivered by waiters. so simple, eating. so taken for granted. at one table sits chuck, dressed in a hawaiian shirt and shorts, with a half dozen plates in front of him. he gestures to the waiter. bring me more. it all tastes so damned good. behind him is the ocean. chuck doesn't glance at it.}
<L>__{interior dentist next day}
<A>__{an attractive dental technician with an australian accent cleans chuck's teeth with an ultrasound device. she's close, very close. chuck looks up at her. she looks really good. she smiles at him, then touches the gap where he knocked out his tooth.}

<D>__{you sure you don't want to have the implant done here? we do quite good work.}
<A>__{chuck shakes his head: no. she scrapes behind his front teeth.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{hmmm, you do have such a lot of tarter behind these front incisors. a little wider, please.}
<A>__{chuck opens his mouth even further. the technician talks on in the self absorbed way dental technicians sometimes do, that constant babble of human contact which chuck has not heard for four years.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{anyway, so the second prosthetic foot worked better, but he still couldn't drive his new cortina, it being a standard shift, if you follow me.}
<A>__{chuck nods. i follow you.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{but would he hear of me driving him around? not on your bloody life. rinse please.}
<A>__{chuck does. stan bursts into the room.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{chuck! god damn!}
<A>__{chuck struggles out of the chair.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{god damn. god damn. god damn.}
<A>__{they are both almost overcome. stan holds chuck by the shoulders and looks at him.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you're alive, you're fucking alive!}
<A>__{chuck laughs, thrilled to see stan.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i beat the odds!}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you beat 'em to shit, pal! jesus!}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{i still need to floss you.}
<A>__{stan notices the technician.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{this is amber. her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.}
<A>__{he says this with an absolute straight face, holding back the laughter with great effort. instantly there's this connection again between him and stan.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{ex boyfriend.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{really.}
<A>__{and he and chuck make eye contact and we see a glimpse of their shared unspoken irony.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{uh, there's somebody out here who wants to see you.}
<A>__{chuck stares sharply at him. kelly? stan nods, but there's something he wants to say.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{she thought you were dead. we all did.}
<A>__{that's not all stan wants to say. but chuck is limping out the door.}
<L>__{interior dentist waiting room}
<A>__{typical dentist waiting room. chairs, tropical fish tanks, magazines, a few waiting patients...and kelly, looking nervous. slowly and painfully chuck enters. he's quite a sight. she stands up. there's a long moment where they look at each other. then she comes into his arms. holds him tight. she's part laughing, part crying.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i'm sorry... i'm sorry...}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{hey...hey...it's okay!}
<A>__{chuck is happy, he's still riding the high.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you're so thin. am i hurting you?}
<A>__{well, maybe a little, but who cares? he hasn't been hugged or barely touched in so long.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no...no...feels good...}
<A>__{she disengages, looks at him with that old smile.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{right back, you said you'd be right back.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{a few things came up. or went down.}
<A>__{he meets her gaze, looks her over with a smile.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you look...wonderful. i like your hair.}
<A>__{he notices the ring on her hand.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i got married.}

<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{if i'd known you were alive }
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i would have done the same thing.}
<A>__{his responses come so quick. chuck seems blissfully sure of himself.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i didn't want to. it just happened. one day gary was there. he took care of everything. he took care of me. i was a mess.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you have any children?}
<A>__{kelly nods.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{got a picture?}

<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{her name's hannah.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{is that jango?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{no, this is jack. jango was hit by a ups truck. can you believe it?}
<A>__{chuck laughs. it is funny, sort of.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{life's just one big joke after another.}
<A>__{stan appears, takes in the scene. the few patients waiting are edged into the corners, trying to look occupied with something else.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{how about we go somewhere else?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{want to see my raft?}
<L>__{exterior hawaii day}
<A>__{chuck's raft sits up on a dock. kelly stands staring at it. how small and fragile it looks.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{this stinks really bad.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you should have smelled me.}
<A>__{stan examines the ropes around the logs.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{cool ropes.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i braided them.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{must have taken a hell of a long time.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{time i had lots of.}
<A>__{kelly points at something on the raft.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{that's my sea anchor. my second one. made it out of part of the sail. it keeps you from capsizing in a storm. in theory.}
<P>__{(picks up his still)}
<D>__{and this, this i used to collect water. about half a cup a day.}
<A>__{he's not feeling sorry for himself. it's just a fact.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you were how long on this?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{forty three days.}
<A>__{they look at the tiny raft. it speaks for itself.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{all that time i waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{yeah, well...couldn't be helped.}
<A>__{kelly notices the sail, sees the writing on it.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what's that, written on the sail?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{my epitaph.}
<A>__{kelly reads it to herself. her eyes are moist.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{bad body chemistry. made me a little morbid. but i'm all over that now.}
<A>__{and he seems really to believe it.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i will be at the car.}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{take you to the airport.}
<A>__{and he leaves.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i buried you, chuck. they had to pry my fingers off your coffin.}

<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{there was a coffin?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what was inside?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{that about sums it up.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{maybe now's when you tell me about it.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{the plane went down. my friends died. i washed up on an island. then i found these barrels, built the raft, and here i am.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{the tide came in, the tide went out. i survived. that's the headline. i survived.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{don't overwhelm me with the details.}
<P>__{(she smiles remembering)}
<D>__{you know how i hate that.}
<A>__{he tries to put it into words, isn't quite sure how.}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{come on. try.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{cliches, mainly. don't take anyone for granted. don't sweat the small stuff. live each day like it's your last.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{so simple to say, so hard to do.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{not when you have no choice.}
<A>__{kelly looks down at the raft. it's so small.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you hated being alone. couldn't stand it. busy every minute. always plugged into something.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i didn't know what really being alone was. no one back here does.}
<A>__{he has something more to say. she waits.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{we're not meant to be alone. not like that. share life, that's what came to me out there. be with someone.}
<A>__{and that's the point, isn't it? we are social animals. no man is an island.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{this is so unfair.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{that's what i told the fish i caught. but i ate them anyway.}
<A>__{and the laughter comes again. kelly grins, embarrassed, a little worried.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{great. really.}
<A>__{she stares at his face, reaches out, touches it again, this time with great tenderness. he nods, her touch feels so good. a wave of emotion comes over her: pity? love?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what will you do?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i don't know. i really don't know.}
<A>__{we hear a distant beep beep, discrete as a car horn can be.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i've got to get back to memphis. hannah's babysitter has finals.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{it means a lot...that you came.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i had to come. to be sure you were okay.}

<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you've been over the line and you came back. you've been saved, hallelujah!}

<D>__{i'm serious. the burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what's it all about? it's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid that's what it's about.}
<A>__{stan sits back, repulsed but relieved.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{do what it takes. that's what i always told you.}

<D>__{believe me i know.}
<A>__{he takes a sip of his drink, just savoring it, thinking.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{but it's not being bold or being in the game or rolling the dice.}
<A>__{all those things stan used to tell him.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{when i was going crazy, on the raft, i'd argue with myself about everything. because everything had a price. to get anything a sip of water, a little corner of shade, an hour's sleep i had to let go of something else. and then i could never get it back.}
<A>__{he thinks some more.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you don't win or lose. you win and lose.}

<A>__{chuck sits back on the couch, taking in the sight of the ocean in the light rain. he looks over at all the canvases, the easel, the palettes. the wind rustles the palm trees around the house. the surf crashes and rustles. familiar sounds. island sounds. he relaxes a little. maybe the package with the wings was a sign, he kept it all these years precisely for this. then there's a sound of a truck in the driveway. the engine cuts off. there are steps on the porch. the door opens. a tanned muscular man in neatly kept work clothes comes in, hangs a tool belt on a hook by the door. he looks at chuck with a relaxed, even stare, as if seeing a man in a fedex uniform sitting on his couch is not an unusual occurrence.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{hey.}
