<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{...think of us as you soar triumphantly through the sky, outshining any star, your silhouette a dark blot breaking the perfect circle of the moon... we who are left behind here will surely be thinking of you.}
<A>__{jack stands tall beside his sleigh.}
<B>__{the street band}
<A>__{rattles a delicate "jingle bells."}
<B>__{the townspeople}
<A>__{look on proudly.}
<B>__{sally}
<A>__{hurries back with a steaming cup of her special sleeping potion tea.}
<B>__{the mayor}
<A>__{blabs on:}
<C>__{mayor }
<D>__{you who are our pride; you who are our glory; you who have frightened millions into an early grave; you who have devastated }
<A>__{his speech is suddenly interrupted by the}
<B>__{descent of a thick halloween fog.}
<A>__{the fog swirls around the assembled crowd. it licks at the mayor. it threatens to engulf jack, the sleigh, the skeleton reindeer.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh no...!}
<B>__{sally}
<A>__{gazes about her in happy wonder. the sight of the fog brings a wide, welcoming look of hope to her face. she dumps out the tea it eats a hole in the ground she won't be needing it after all...}
<B>__{the fog}
<A>__{swallows everyone.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i will never get the sleigh off the ground in this. the reindeer can't see an inch in front of their noses...}
<C>__{vampire voice }
<D>__{this fog's as thick as...}
<C>__{monster voice }
<P>__{(finishes the thought)}
<D>__{...jellied brains.}
<C>__{vampire voice }
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{jack }
<P>__{(woe increasing)}
<D>__{there go my hopes, my plans, my dreams... the tall tales, the legends, the lies...}
<A>__{there is a thin ghostly bark (o.s.) it belongs to zero. his little jack o'lantern nose floats in... a tiny beacon penetrating the fog.}
<C>__{corpse voice }
<P>__{(dour and slow)}
<D>__{there goes christmas...}
<C>__{jack }
<P>__{(morose)}
<D>__{no, zero... not now... down, boy...}
<A>__{after a long beat...}
<C>__{jack }
<P>__{(has a sudden idea)}
<D>__{hey! wait a minute!}
<A>__{we hear the sounds of rummaging, of jack muttering:}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{where did i put that book...? i know it's in here somewhere... here it is...}
<A>__{we hear pages turned back and forth... then with characteristic melodramatic flourish jack recites:}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{'zero with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?'}
<A>__{barking, zero swoops with pure joy. the crowd cheers. zero floats to the front of the sleigh and takes position. his jack o'lantern nose glows brighter and brighter, soon illuminating the whole sleigh. jack leaps aboard.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we're off!}
<A>__{with a crack of his skeleton whip, jack and his ghostly entourage are instantly aloft. in a moment, they are gone...}
<B>__{sally}
<A>__{gapes into the swirling fog. she stares miserably into the cup she emptied, then back up into the fog choked sky. >>>>> sally's song the street band materializes out of the fog. they listen to her mournful song. moved, they accompany her.}
