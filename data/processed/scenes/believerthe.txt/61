<L>__{interior darkness night}
<A>__{the sound of splitting wood. then voices in a cavernous space...}
<C>__{chaos of voices}
<D>__{ow, shit... you're stepping on my fucking ...get off me...goddammit...}
<P>__{(sounds of punches, a scuffle)}
<D>__{stop it!... where's the light?}
<A>__{one appears, illuminating nothing, dissipating into the still vaster darkness. a series of lights bang on in ecclesiastical bursts, illuminating: a vaulted ceiling... stained glass panels... we are:}
<L>__{interior synagogue sanctuary night}
<A>__{a dour, ornate place built in the early decades of the century. the sight of it silences everyone for a moment. then...}
<C>__{carleton}
<D>__{jew world...!!}
<A>__{drake, billings, carleton, o.l. and steroid run wild... kicking over benches...spray painting swastikas...hurling prayer books...urinating from the balcony... ...danny looks around like someone revisiting his childhood home: slides his hand along a pew back...leafs through a chumash...gazes up at the eternal lamp behind its red glass...the gilded doors of the ark... a hint of kol nidre music haunts him....}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(to himself, barely a whisper)}
<D>__{shut up. fuck you....}
<C>__{kyle }
<D>__{what...?}
<A>__{danny turns; kyle is right behind him.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{nothing. where is it?}
<P>__{(as kyle hoists a sports bag)}
<D>__{okay, let's take one of these panels off so we can get under the bema...the stage.}
<A>__{as they unscrew a panel, carleton runs past. a football flashes overhead. we hear glass break...laughter.}
