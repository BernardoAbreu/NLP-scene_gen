<A>__{worf and data climb as data scans and indicates the direction:}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{ten meters...}
<A>__{worf pulls his phaser, ready.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i think it unlikely you will need your phaser to recover the cranial unit. of course, it could bite you.}
<A>__{then they see it. data's head. or the spitting image anyway. lying inert in the dust before them.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{it's you.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{the resemblance is... striking.}
<A>__{then the head's eyes suddenly pop open. it looks up at them with a sort of blank, childlike wonder.}
<C>__{head}
<D>__{why am i looking at me?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{you are not looking at yourself. you are looking at me.}
<C>__{head}
<P>__{(looking at worf)}
<D>__{you do not look like me.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(to head)}
<D>__{i would like to pick you up now. may i do that?}
<C>__{head}
<P>__{(to worf)}
<D>__{you have a pretty shirt.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{data gently picks up the head. looks at it. the two identical faces gaze at each other.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{fascinating...}
<A>__{then blam! a boulder near them explodes. worf and data spin to see... a nomadic tribe of desert aliens swarming toward them firing primitive plasma weapons data and worf race back down the canyon, toward the jeep some open field running and a bit of phaser action worf firing to distract and slow the aliens, not kill them through all of this the head is chattering away blandly:}
<C>__{head}
<D>__{i have two arms and ten fingers. do you know where my arms are? i cannot see where we are going. where are we going?}
<P>__{(etc... like threepio in}
<D>__{"empire" when he's strapped to chewbacca's}
<P>__{back.)}
<A>__{the action continues. then data finds himself almost surrounded }
<C>__{data}
<D>__{commander!}
<A>__{worf turns data throws the head to worf like a football, a perfect spiral the head is still chattering away worf catches it }
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{stop talking!}
<A>__{the head abruptly stops talking. data, hands free now, quickly incapacitates the aliens around him with a dazzling demonstration of his superior strength and agility. meanwhile, worf tucks the head under his arm and sprints like a master running back evading aliens and occasionally firing his phaser they are closer to the jeep now but they are in trouble the swarm of aliens almost overtaking them ! when a thundering blast sends up a shower of debris, stopping the aliens picard is standing in the rear of the jeep, firing the phaser canon. data and worf climb into the jeep as picard leaps into the front seat and roars off }
