<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{dragon country day galen bounds up the rocky slope as fast as he can manage, trailed by a desperate valerian.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{galen, stop! please, i beg you!}
<A>__{but galen pays no attention. in a burst of speed and fury, valerian comes up behind and tackles him.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{stop! i won't let you kill yourself.}
<A>__{galen waves the leather pouch in valerian's face.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{he couldn't walk he knew he couldn't make the journey. so he had us make the journey for him! don't you see?}
<A>__{he jumps up and runs to the mouth of the lair.}
<C>__{valerian}
<P>__{(pursuing)}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she tackles him again.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{all right, all right. you're going in there, i'm going too.}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(brought up short)}
<D>__{what? why? no you're not, this is my job. absolutely not.}
<A>__{but valerian springs to her feet and starts into the lair.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{i'm not afraid. and you're not going to stop me. after all i've been a man longer than you have.}
<A>__{galen pauses long enough to snatch up a discarded torch near the remains of the wooden stake, then charges after her.}
<B>__{underground}
<A>__{running footsteps resound in the steamy passageway and galen comes around the corner holding his torch high to light the way. valerian stumbles after him. he grabs her hand.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{stay close.}
<A>__{down and down they go. soon they reach elspeth's body.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{never mind. come on.}
<A>__{but she pulls the torch from his hand and goes over to see.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{all right. wait here.}
<A>__{he darts off. in the flickering torchlight valerian can see the princess' remains all too clearly. she suppresses a scream.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{galen? galen? where are you?}
<A>__{no answer. the torch reveals several passages. she doesn't know which one to take.}
<B>__{lake of fire}
<A>__{the passage widens out and once again galen is standing on the shores of the lake of fire. he looks around. the water is rolling with bubbles of gas, and flames run hither and yon across the surface, but there is no sign of the dragon. gathering his courage, he hops across the stepping stones to the middle of the lake. there he hurriedly opens the pouch.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{ex favilla, vita nova!}
<A>__{gripping the amulet with his free hand, he scatters ulrich's ashes in a wide arc over the burning water. instantly, there is an ominous rumble and the earth gives a shrug. but no wizard appears. no dragon, either. there follows another and stronger quake. galen crouches to keep his balance. still no wizard.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{thoroughly bewildered, valerian stumbles out into daylight. she wanders a few yards down the slope and collapses against the stake. something is strange: it's getting dark. squinting up at the sun, she frowns in puzzlement, then gapes at what is happening.}
<B>__{eclipse}
<A>__{slowly and ponderously the black disk of the moon slides over the face of the sun, plunging the world into crepuscular half light.}
