<D>__{if a girl is into you, she's sleeping with you. and if after a month two months at the very outside she's not sleeping with you, she does not like you. i guess the trick is, how to spot this girl early so you don't waste the one to seven weeks waiting to find out that it's never gonna happen. so, i've got some signs about how to spot this girl gleaned from my own experience, of course. a girl will never sleep with you if: she calls you cuddly or dependable, she pops a zit in front of you, her name is amber or christine, she takes a dump in your bathroom or she takes home leftovers in dates 1 3. i know it's not scientific but i'm just saying you were warned.}
