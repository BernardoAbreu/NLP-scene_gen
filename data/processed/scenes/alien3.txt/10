<L>__{exterior arceon sea dusk}
<A>__{the waters grown rough with the approach of night. wind whips across white wave tops sprays the dozen monks who lash their boats to ripley's ship with thick hemp ropes start to tow it to shore...}
<L>__{interior ripley's room night}
<A>__{ripley is sleeping but struggling against some unseen foe she tries to sit up can't. tries to shake off the effects of the suspended animation...looks up through half lidded eyes:}
<B>__{john}
<A>__{sits next to her. quite asleep. hands swathed in white bandages. book resting on his lap. she squints to make the figure standing in the shadows behind him it's skin picks up and reflects tiny points of flickering cangle light seems to ripple as it moves }
<B>__{the alien}
<A>__{big, black shiny smooth head moves into the taper light. it moves towards her, cable like arms held out at its side moving out of sync with its feet ripley tries to move to cry out she can't. she can only move her eyes. she looks over at john, sleeping peacefully. he doesn't notice the alien the alien moves closer. she can feel his breath it evaporates the sweat on her forehead a chill runs through her but she still can't move the alien stands alongside her bed. extends a six fingered hand... gently rests it on her stomach. cocks its head like it's listening to something. the implication is clear. ripley finds her voice }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaaaargh!}
<A>__{her eyes open wide she sits bolt upright. a hand moves to her forehead. gently pushes her head back to the pillow. john's.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're out of it. out of it...}
<A>__{ripley falls back, eyes glued to where the alien appeared. john sees her focal point, looks back over his shoulder: nothing. ripley's eyes roll back into her head. she tries to speak it was there. her hand, at her side, tightens into a fist john's hand covers hers. eases the fingers open again. she feels the coarse bandages against her palm. he starts to read quietly from saint augustines' confessions. she begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over her like waves lapping against the shore...}
