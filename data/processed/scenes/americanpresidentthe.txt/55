<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior staircase night}
<A>__{shepherd and sydney are walking down the staircase that leads to the red carpeted hall through which the president enters the east room. the group escorting the president gives them wide berth so that the two of them can have some privacy.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{once we hit the bottom of the stairs, i gotta do a thing. you'll be escorted...}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{they took me through it.}
<A>__{after a slight pause }
<C>__{sydney}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{do you do this often, sir?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this is, actually, only our second state dinner. the first was for the emperor of japan, who died shortly after that, so we stopped having them for a while, just in case.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i meant do you go out on...do you often do you }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{do i date a lot?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{well, yeah.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{no. how 'bout you?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{me? lately, i seem to be going out on a lot of first dates.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{then you're experienced at this.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{oh yeah, you can ask me anything.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{how are we doing so far?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{it's hard to say at this pointerior so far it's just your typical first date stuff.}
<A>__{and all of a sudden an incredible sound from inside the east room the marine corps brass and percussion ensemble plays four ruffles and flourishes.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{damn. and i wanted to find a way to be different from the other guys.}
<A>__{a booming voice over the p.a. announces }
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, the president of the united states.}
<A>__{and now the whole walk timing out with incredible precision }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{by the way, nice shoes.}
<A>__{ shepherd walks into the hall as the brass and percussion ensemble plays hail to the chief. the 180 guests come to their feet and applaud long and loud. the group following the president catches up to the spot where sydney has stopped walking. they all join in the applause. we can see in sydney's face that she's been quite swept up.}
