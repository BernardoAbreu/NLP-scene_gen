<T>__{back to:}
<L>__{exterior deep space (factory floor) continuous}
<A>__{the transport cart continues toward the 3rd planet.}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{here we are, then. look familiar?}
<A>__{arthur turns and looks. there before him is... o1a earth arthur is thunderstruck...then confused. 101a}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so it wasn't destroyed?}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{actually, it was. this is a back up. earth mark ii.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so you're saying you ... made the earth?}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{well, not me alone. it was a group effort. i did my part, though. ever heard of a place, i think it's called norway?}
<A>__{arthur nods. the cart pushes through the clouds, towards ayers rock. a guy on a ladder is painting it it's familiar red color. some of it is still primer grey.}
<C>__{slartibartfast }
<D>__{that was one of mine. won an award you know. lovely crinkly edges. i was sorry to hear about it being blown up. shocking cock up. the mice were furious.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{mice? who cares about bloody mice?}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{are you a fan of plate tectonics?}
<A>__{arthur looks up. slartibartfast points down. another man pushes a button causing mountains to spring up noisily.}
<C>__{slartibartfast }
<D>__{voila! himalayas. good, eh?}
<A>__{arthur is working very hard to process all this. jump cut. they move through a forest where a man presses a lever making several mushrooms pop up on the ground.}
<C>__{slartibartfast }
<D>__{earthman, you must realize that the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice. it was destroyed shortly before the completion of the purpose for which it was built. ten minutes later, we would have been free and clear. but we gave them our standard ten million year warranty and they have come here to retrieve this back up copy. and they've brought you with them. the transport cart flies out of forest toward the ocean.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{they brought...i'm sorry, when you say "mice" do you mean the little white furry creatures with the cheese fixation?}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{these creatures you call "mice" are merely the protrusion into our dimension of hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings. the whole business with the cheese must've been a front. they were experimenting on you, you see. a vast computer program...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{ah. i see where you're confused. you see we were experimenting on them.}
<A>__{over the ocean, a "perfect storm" wave rolls toward them.}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{oh, i gather they arranged for you to conduct some primitively staged experiments so they could prod your thinking here and there. but you were actually elements in the computer program. they really are very clever hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings.}
<P>__{(looking down)}
<D>__{ah. they've nearly finished the oceans.}
<A>__{they move toward the white cliffs of dover. a man stands on a cliff holding a giant hose, water spewing from it.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so you're trying to tell me that mice designed and built deep thought...and deep thought designed the earth...which was a giant supercomputer...that you built...to calculate the ultimate question. only, vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the program was completed?}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{that's bureaucracy for you.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{actually, this explains a lot. all my life i've had this strange feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, something sinister ...}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{that's just perfectly normal paranoia. everyone in the universe has that.}
