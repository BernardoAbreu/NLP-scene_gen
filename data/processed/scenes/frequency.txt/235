<A>__{shepard is on top of julia in the shower. he uncoils the garrote, snaps it taut, and starts around her neck. and then a sound. instantly recognizable. beyond adequate description. but once you've heard it, you don't forget it... chuut, chuut, chuut: the sound of a 12 guage pump action}
<B>__{shotgun ratcheting around the corner.}
<A>__{shepard's head spins about. frank stands in the doorway, shotgun aimed at shepard's face.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{get your fucking hands off my wife.}
<C>__{shepard}
<D>__{don't. don't do it, frank. you're not a killer.}
<A>__{he is right. frank hesitates. shepard lunges, grabbing the shotgun barrel. boom! frank fires. buckshot rips through the air. shepard's right hand explodes...blood spattering everywhere. like a wounded animal, shepard bolts, blowing past frank. frank gently wraps julia in a towel. the fading sound of shepard thundering down the stairs. out the door. and then softer footsteps. coming closer. johnny appears in the doorway. safe and sound.}
