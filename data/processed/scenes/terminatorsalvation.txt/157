<A>__{underwater day the submarine "los angeles" moves toward camera as it slowly sinks deeper beneath the water's surface. we see a makeshift steel patch welded near the hatch.}

<L>__{interior submarine corridor day}
<A>__{marcus waits outside the entrance to the sickbay. he's cleaned up a bit, wears fresh clothes (one sleeve pinned up). he seems weary, wrung out, his systems damaged. he'll move stiffly through the following scene, like a stroke victim. star sits beside him, a hand on his arm. blair approaches from down the corridor.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{marcus... i need to head back to my unit.}
<A>__{marcus nods, keeps his head bowed.}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{what about you?}
<A>__{his voice is still weak.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i have no idea. i should be dead...}
<C>__{star}
<D>__{but you're alive.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(a half smile)}
<D>__{so to speak.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{we've been ordered not to talk about it the hybrids, everything about that place is top secret...}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{yeah, simpler to keep it man versus machine.}
<A>__{star gingerly reaches up to touch the torn plastic at the back of marcus' head, where the interface was.}
<C>__{star}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what did it feel like? to be... one of them?}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(thoughtful beat)}
<D>__{better than anything. everything made sense. for the first time in my life, i felt... right. it was heaven.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{how could you give that up?}
<A>__{he turns to her, exposing his mangled face, one eye gone.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i never really believed in heaven.}
<A>__{blair takes this in, fishes in a pocket.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{here. you need these more than i do.}
<A>__{she holds out a pair of sunglasses. marcus, a bit amused, slips them on. the door opens nearby and an ashen faced kate emerges.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{he wants to see you.}
<A>__{blair gives marcus a farewell hug.}
