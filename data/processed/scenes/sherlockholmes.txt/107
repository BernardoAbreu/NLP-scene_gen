<A>__{a figure moves across the dark, gothic courtyard. it is ambassador standish. as he cuts through the shadows... a few drops of rain trickle down. he looks up, surprised by the rain. he raises his collar, and keeps moving. he hits the door to a building. it is locked. he bangs on the door, as the rain comes harder. the door finally opens. as he enters, we see the rain stops behind him, gone as fast as it came. a raven flaps into the night.}
