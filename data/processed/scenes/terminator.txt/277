<A>__{reese uses the butt of the shotgun to smash loose the ignition assembly. he begins working on the wires. a police cruiser appears, moving slowly between the rows of cars. reese grabs sarah and pulls her down to huddle below dash level. a moment later a spotlight flashes across the seats above them. they hear the helicopter circling closer.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{reese...why me? why does it want me?}
<A>__{they are lying very close, a forced intimacy. reese's voice is an urgent whisper, almost in her ear. a cruiser passes so close they can hear its radio clearly.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{there's so much...}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{tell me. just start at the beginning.}
<A>__{reese musters his thoughts. and starts.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{there was a war. a few years from now. nuclear war. the whole thing. all this }
<A>__{his gesture includes the car, the city, the world.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ everythingis gone. just gone. there were survivors. here. there. nobody knew who started it.}

<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i don't understand...}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{defense network computer. new. powerful. hooked into everything. trusted to run it all. they say it got smart...a new order of intelli gence. then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.}
<A>__{reese pauses, and when he continues it's less like a military briefing, quieter.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{didn't see the war. i was born after, in the ruins. grew up there. starving. hiding from the h k's.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{hunter killers. patrol machines. build in automated factories. most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.}
<A>__{he pushes up the sleeve of his jacket and shows her a ten digit number etches on the skin of his forearm. beneath the numbers is a pattern of lines like the auto matic pricing marks on product packages.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{burned in by laser scan.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{some of us were kept alive... to work. loading bodies. the disposal units ran night and day. we were that close to going out forever...}
<A>__{the helicopter moves overhead. its searchlight illum inates the car interior, moves on. before the rotor sound fads, reese starts the car.}
