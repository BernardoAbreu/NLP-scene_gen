<L>__{interior st. luc's office night}
<A>__{st. luc is reading a section of one of hobbes's medical papers in preparation for examining tudor later on. the section we see says: '...thus the theoretical organism we are now considering would exhibit what i choose to call "compressed evolution." this in effect means that each generation of the said organism would be better adapted to inhabit and to control the behavior of its host...' suddenly forsythe bursts in, out of breath, semi hysterical, tearful. st. luc rises from his chair and forsythe throws herself on him, sobbing.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{forsythe, forsythe! what's wrong? what's happened?}
<C>__{forsythe}
<D>__{a man... i think i recognized him... a man who lives here. he just...}
<P>__{(breaking down)}
<D>__{...he just attacked me for no reason at all. i just opened the door... i was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...}
<A>__{st. luc hugs forsythe for a moment, then holds her away from him so that he can get some information out of her.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{where is he now? do you know?}
<C>__{forsythe}
<D>__{i think i... i think i killed him. i stabbed him with something and he fell.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{will you be ok now? i've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. i've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.}
<C>__{forsythe}
<D>__{oh, no! you're not leaving me here all alone. i'm going with you.}
<A>__{st. luc hesitates for a second, then grabs his black leather doctor's bag.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{ok, c'mon.}
<A>__{they leave.}
