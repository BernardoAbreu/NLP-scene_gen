<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{thank you for showing it to me first. i will... i will take care of it. can i have the picture?}
<C>__{mrs. boswell}

<D>__{fat little baby, crying for mommy.}

<D>__{come on, lenny. it's not that bad. you can still see your mom a little.}
<A>__{lenny, unable to stop crying, begins hyperventilating out of control. his desperate gasps for breath are frightening. evan, scared, looks around for mrs. boswell, but cannot find her. he reaches up to his own picture and quickly tears his own macaroni "mother" apart and places it over lenny's picture. it's a nuclear family again. lenny slowly is able to catch his breath.}

<L>__{exterior lenny's backyard day 1987}
<A>__{evan, 5, comes to at a birthday party. he's unexpectedly gently prodded forward by andrea.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{go on, evan. introduce yourself.}
<A>__{evan slowly approaches kayleigh, only five. she smiles bashfully at him. an old memory comes back to him.}
<C>__{kayleigh }
<D>__{when my folks split, they gave me and tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. i couldn't stand my dad, but i knew if i lived with my mom, i'd never see you again...}
<A>__{evan slowly looks around the yard, taking in the reality of this distant memory. he even inhales the aroma of the place. savoring the moment. he locks eyes with kayleigh.}
<C>__{andrea }
<D>__{he's not usually this shy.}
<A>__{it's time. evan leans over to kayleigh as if he's about to kiss her. then whispers in her ear:}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i hate you. if you ever come near me again, i will kill you and your whole family.}
<A>__{kayleigh reacts predictably. bursting into tears and runs into kayleigh's mother's arms.}
<C>__{kayleigh's mother}
<D>__{what did you say to her? what happened?!}
<A>__{evan ignores them. he can't take his eyes off kayleigh.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{his eyes well up. flash!}

<L>__{interior evan's dorm day 2002}
<A>__{evan wakes up with a bloody nose. he grabs a pillow and covers his head with it as a flood of memories seizes him. lenny (looking fit) grabs a towel from atop an award winning flatworms project and hands it to evan.}
<C>__{lenny }
<D>__{you alright? should i call the doctor?}
<A>__{evan groans and shakes his head "no". he rides out the pain like a seasoned pro. when it finally subsides, he lowers the pillow and smiles feebly.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i will think i will be alright this time.}
<P>__{(a new hope)}
<D>__{i really do.}
<A>__{lenny nods, still concerned.}
<L>__{interior college incinerator room later}
<A>__{evan opens the door to a concrete room with a large furnace. he and lenny carry cardboard boxes.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{you sure about this?}
<A>__{evan nods. they silently dump tons of journals into the fire. evan steps outside and returns with a box of home movies, photo albums, old report cards, etc. in they go.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{burning journals.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior city street day 2010}
<A>__{evan, a suit now, walks down a city street cradling a cell phone to his ear. title card: years later}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yeah, ma. i'm running a little late for lunch. one of my patients had a breakdown. anyway, order some soup in the meantime. see ya soon.}
<A>__{as he clicks off, an attractive woman wearing a power suit approaches from the other direction. evan has to look closely, but it's kayleigh. a mature woman, now. he stumbles slightly, caught off guard. as she passes, her eyes linger on his a little longer than necessary, but there's no recognition. evan watches her continue past him and down the sidewalk. after a hesitant beat, he takes a breath, turns around and follows her.}
