<A>__{most of the sequences in this production are filmed using a hand held camera or a steadycam. these very mobile cameras move around the set, and get constantly closer and further from the characters. still, we'll be using the usual technical terms, such as long shot or full shot or medium shot here and there to give the reader an idea of the location of the camera at the beginning of each sequence. and then we'll mention the movements of the camera.}

<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{oh, it it it...}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a while. that was her problem.}
