<L>__{exterior high school football field day}
<A>__{various high school sports teams practice. maggie strides across the football field, a scowl on her face. a few high school football players job past maggie, doing laps. a boy, kendall, calls out to her affectionately as she passes. one of them, dennis, slows his pace to run alongside maggie.}
<C>__{dennis}
<P>__{(playful)}
<A>__{maggie, don't marry coach! marry me. i love you.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{you're jail bait, dennis. go away. run your laps. go. go. dennis runs on as maggie continues toward her goal: bob and ike, standing together on the other side of the field.}
<B>__{angle on bob and ike}
<A>__{they're both standing on the blocking sled. wave after wave of varsity football players ram into the sled and drive it across the field with both ike and bob on top of it. ike is munching on one of the cinnamon rolls as bob pushes the kids.}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{drive! drive! from your hips, get low, get low, get low. next! ike smiles broadly atop of the sled as he sees maggie approaching, looking mighty peeved. he nudges bob and points to maggie. bob lights up at the sight of her.}
<C>__{bob }
<A>__{good job, gentlemen... special teams. the football players move away from the sled. bob moves to maggie, leaves ike alone.}
<C>__{bob }
<P>__{(to maggie)}
<A>__{hey, honey! bob kisses and embraces maggie. she doesn't see ike immediately, then:}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(indicating ike)}
<A>__{what is he up to now?}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{ike just came by to check out the team.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{and talk about you. ike grins and shows maggie the notes in his pocket.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{bob are you making friends with this man?}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{i'm just bragging about how great you are. i'm the luckiest man alive. bob grabs maggie around the waist and smooches her adoringly. maggie scowls at ike. he nods, all charm.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{well i've got to get moving lot of work to do today! i will see you two love birds later. ike leaves. bob calls after him.}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{see you at the wedding.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{you bet ya, coach. maggie is aghast. she stares at bob. ike joins in behind a line of peppy cheerleaders.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{at the wedding? you invite him? bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{sure i do. but the bet defense is a good offense, right? you're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{you don't understand this guy.}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{let him come to the wedding. you're not running, right? say it. "i'm not..."}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(irritably)}
<A>__{i'm not running.}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{so if you're not running and ike graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right? all we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i've got news for you. no amount of sugar and water is going to turn like graham into something you want to take on a picnic. bob gives maggie a big hug.}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{where's that homemade sunshine? bob blows his whistle, then puts maggie on the football sled.}
<C>__{bob }
<A>__{i want you boys to take my princess on the ride of her life... honey, tell 'em where you parked your car. maggie screams as the boys push her down the football field.}
