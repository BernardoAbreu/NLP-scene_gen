<L>__{interior well appointed executive boardroom day}
<A>__{sam and a group of fifteen somber japanese businessmen are sitting around a large granite conference table. sam stands up and speaks a simple greeting to them.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(in japanese)}
<D>__{good morning, gentlemen. on behalf of market security bank & trust, i welcome you to our city.}
<A>__{the men smile happily and nod their heads in unison.}
<C>__{men}
<D>__{arigato.}
<A>__{they look to sam, expecting more. uncomfortable, he clears his throat.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm afraid that's the only japanese i know. but i realize it's not our language fluency, or lack of it, that brings you to market security. rather, i'm sure, it is our banking expertise, our ability to represent and anticipate all of your banking needs. as you know, we are not the largest banking establishment in new york.}
<P>__{(his throat goes dry}
<D>__{and he takes a sip}
<P>__{of water)}
<D>__{but, with combined assets of over 200 billion dollars, we have a firm commitment to the international marketplace.}
<A>__{a secretary enters the room and hands sam a piece of paper. it reads "molly on line 2. urgent." she hands him a phone. sam looks surprised. he nods apologetically to his guests.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<P>__{(he picks up the receiver)}
<D>__{hello?}
