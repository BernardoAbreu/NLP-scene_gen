<L>__{interior corridor night}
<A>__{white is running again, clutching bumstead's map.}
<B>__{camera pulls back and up}
<A>__{reveals the entire corridor. keeps pulling back until the view is impossibly wide like a cross section of the building he's in, a doll's house with the roof taken off. the tiny figure runs, amidst a dark network of surrounding rooms and passages.}
<B>__{continue pull back}
<A>__{white is no more than a speck the hall way stretches endlessly in both directions, behind and in front of the moving figure, through an infinite labyrinth.}
<B>__{wider still}
<A>__{we no longer make out the figure. the x rayed environment resembles some intricate aerial map of the vast city the corridor an ever increasing spiral.}
