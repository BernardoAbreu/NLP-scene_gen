<L>__{90 casbah. streets. outside. morning.}
<A>__{women are clinging together after the beatings. someone is fleeing toward the terraces. we hear the deafening whirl of the helicopters flying against the wind, their cabin doors open, paras sitting on both sides with their legs dangling out, their machine guns on their knees, a loudspeaker for every helicopter, microphones turned on in such a way that the din of the motors is multiplied a hundred times. the helicopters fly low again, they skirt the terraces. the algerians are fleeing in terror, the uproar begins to fade away, is less intense; microphones are turned on, and off. the terraces are emptied, men seized, beaten, dragged; all the men are forced outside in the alleys, the streets, the squares, every man is forced to face the wall, his hands up.}
