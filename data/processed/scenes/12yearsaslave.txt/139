<L>__{interior epps's plantation slave shack night}
<A>__{the slaves are at rest. gripping his whip epps enters, without so much as a knock at the door. for a moment there's curiosity; is he there for a dance, for patsey...? looking right to solomon:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{get up.}
<A>__{solomon does. epps heads back out into the dark. he says nothing, but his directive is clear: follow me.}
<L>__{exterior master epps's plantation slave shack continuous}
<A>__{solomon comes out into the dark. nearly hidden in the shadows is a bitter epps. despite the lack of light, epps's malevolence is quite clear. his whip attached to his hip. as he speaks, he stokes himself with swigs from a flask. epps puts his arm around solomon, as if consoling a friend, and guides him into the woods.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{well, boy. i understand i've got a larned nigger that writes}
<C>__{epps }
<D>__{letters and tries to get white fellows to mail 'em.}
<A>__{solomon, hardly missing a beat, plays this off.}
<P>__{epps (cont’d)}
<D>__{well, armsby tol' me today the devil was among my niggers. that i had one that needed close watchin' or he would run away. when i axed him why, he said you come over to him and waked him up in the middle of the night and wanted him to carry a letter to marksville. what have yah got to say to that?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{all i have to say, master, is all that need be said. there is no truth in it.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you say.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{how could i write a letter without ink or paper? there is nobody i want to write to 'cause i hain't got no friends living as i know of. that armsby is a lying drunken fellow. you know this, just as you know that i am constant in truth. now, master, i can see what that armsby is after, plain enough. didn't he want you to hire him for an overseer?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<P>__{solomon (cont’d)}
<D>__{that's it. he wants to make you believe we're all going to run away and then he thinks you'll hire an overseer to watch us. he believes you are soft soap. he's given to such talk. i believe he's just made this story out of whole cloth, 'cause he wants to get a situation. it's all a lie, master, you may depend on't. it's all a lie.}
<A>__{for a tense moment we are unsure which way epps'll go. increasingly it become apparent that, shallow minded and equally soused, solomon has been able to fold epps's thoughts. in a low curse that clearly states his ill intentions. revealed is a pocket knife, which all through the conversation, unknown to us the audience, was pushed up against solomon's stomach. as epps speaks, he closes it and taps it on solomon's shoulder.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i'm damned. i will be god... were he not free and white, platt. were he not free and white.}
<A>__{epps heads off. solomon is left to exhale a deep breath.}
