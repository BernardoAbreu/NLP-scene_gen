<L>__{exterior courtyard veranda gittes & cross at breakfast}
<A>__{below them is a corral where hands take arabians, one by one, and work them out, letting them run and literally kick up their heels. cross' attention is diverted by the animals from time to time. an impeccable mexican butler serves them their main course, broiled fish.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{you know, you've got a nasty reputation, mr. gittes. i like that.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(dubious)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{if you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. and it's good advertising.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{it doesn't hurt.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{it's why you attract a client like my daughter.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{probably.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{but i'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{no. she happens to think the last one was murdered.}
<A>__{cross is visibly surprised.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{how did she get that idea?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i think i gave it to her.}
<A>__{cross nods.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{uh huh. oh i hope you don't mind. i believe they should be served with the head.}
<A>__{gittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed over with the heat of cooking.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.}
<C>__{cross}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{tell me. what do the police say?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{they're calling it an accident.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{who's the investigating officer?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{lou escobar he's a lieutenant.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{do you know him?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{oh yes.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{where from?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{we worked in chinatown together.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{would you call him a capable man?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{very.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{honest?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{far as it goes. of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{none.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{that's too bad.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{too bad?}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{it disturbs me, mr. gittes. it makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. financially speaking, of course. how much are you charging her?}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{my usual fee, plus a bonus if i come up with any results.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{are you sleeping with her? come, come, mr. gittes. you don't have to think about that to remember, do you?}
<A>__{gittes laughs.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{if you want an answer to that question i can always put one of my men on the job. good afternoon, mr. cross.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{mr. gittes! you're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. i don't want her taken advantage of. sit down.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{you may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.}
<A>__{this stops gittes. he seems faintly mused by it.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{why is that funny?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{it's what the d.a. used to tell me about chinatown.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{was he right?}
<A>__{gittes shrugs.}
<C>__{cross}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...exactly what do you know about me, mr. gittes?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.}
<C>__{cross}
<P>__{(grunts, then)}
<D>__{'course i'm respectable. i'm old. politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. i will double whatever your fees are and i will pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find hollis' girlfriend.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{his girlfriend?}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{yes, his girlfriend.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{you mean the little chippie he was with at the el macando?}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{yes. she's disappeared, hasn't she?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{doesn't that strike you as odd?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{no. she's probably scared to death.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{if mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{you didn't see mulwray much, did you?}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{when was the last time?}
<A>__{cross starts to reply, then there's the sound of a mariachi band and some men in formation clear a bluff about a hundred yards off. they are dressed like spanish dons on horseback. for the most part they are fat in the saddle and pass along in disordered review to the music.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. i let 'em practice up out here.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{yeah. do you remember the last time you talked to mulwray?}
<A>__{cross shakes his head.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{at my age, you tend to lose track...}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{well, it was about five days ago. you were outside the pig 'n whistle and you had one hell of an argument.}
<A>__{cross looks to gittes in some real surprise.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i've got the photographs in my office. if they'll help you remember. what was the argument about?}
<C>__{cross}
<P>__{(a long pause, then:)}
<D>__{my daughter.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{what about her?}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{just find the girl, mr. gittes. i think she is frightened and i happen to know hollis was fond of her. i'd like to help her if i can.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i didn't realize you and hollis were so fond of each other.}
<A>__{cross looks hatefully at gittes.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{hollis mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... we were a lot closer than evelyn realized.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{if you want to hire me, i still have to know what you and mulwray were arguing about.}
<C>__{cross}
<P>__{(painfully)}
<D>__{well... she's an extremely jealous person. i didn't want her to find out about the girl.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{how did you find out?}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{i've still got a few teeth in my head, mr. gittes, and a few friends in town.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{okay. my secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. tell me are you worried about that girl, or what evelyn might do to her?}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{just find the girl.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i will look into it as soon as i check out some avocado groves.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{avocado groves?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{we'll be in touch, mr. cross.}
