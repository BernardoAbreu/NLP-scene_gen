<L>__{28 wedding room. inside. day.}
<A>__{in the room, a group of girls are busy preparing trays with cups of coffee. they are little more than children, twelve or thirteen years old, with soft complexions, white teeth, and shining eyes. they seem children who are playing, but beneath that veneer of gaiety, some anxiety is noticeable, emotions in suspense. the faltering voice of an old woman calls from the adjoining room. a girl leaves the group, lifts the dividing curtain, and nearing the bed where the old woman is lying, she kneels beside her. the old woman lifts her hand and places it on the girl's hair, caressing her tenderly. she speaks in a wavering voice, and her small yet kind eyes fill with tears. old woman's speech in arabic. the girl nods yes, then she gets up and goes to rejoin her companions. passing before a mirror, she stops a minute to tidy her hair.}
