<D>__{finish him! you finish him!}
<A>__{tommy keeps throwing defiant right jabs at brendan. finally, with no choice, brendan fires back. he batters the defenseless tommy up against the cage and pounds away at him, blasting his left shoulder with punches that make tommy wince in pain. it's anyone's guess how he can take it. brendan presses his brother up against the cage. begging him to quit. but tommy merely responds by elbowing brendan in the face again. this sets the older brother off, and he resumes pounding on tommy until the horn sounds and rosenthal pulls brendan away.}

<D>__{break! break!}
<A>__{brendan heads back to his stool as tommy leans against the cage in agony. the marines scream for him, but his eyes are glazed over. it's unthinkable that he hasn't broken yet. from near cageside, paddy looks to the corner and makes eye contact with brendan. they exchange a small look of understanding. a nod. they both know what needs to be done.}
