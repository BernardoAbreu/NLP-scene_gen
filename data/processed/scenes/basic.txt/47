<L>__{exterior louisiana bayou last night}
<A>__{we track with kendall and childs as they head away from the landing zoe, rifles up, heads down, side by side. moving the brush quickly and quietly, eyes scanning for targets.}
<C>__{kendall }
<D>__{i knew childs a little, we worked at the px together.}
<A>__{the wind is picking up and it's started to rain. their ponchos flap loudly against the elements.}
<C>__{kendall }
<D>__{i started getting it in my head that maybe west had paid him, maybe he was the one who was supposed to give me a training accident }
<A>__{the roar of gunfire! kendall turns towards it, screaming for a moment... until he sees childs lower his smoking rifle, a shredded target on a tree in front of them. he looks down, noticing has his own weapon trained on childs. .. childs steps forward, knocking kendall's rifle away.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{don't you ever point a gun at me!}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{i'm i'm sorry. . .}
<A>__{kendall, terrified. shaking. a beat. childs picks up the rifle from the ground and hands it back to him.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{come on, let's move.}
<A>__{various shots kendall and childs, moving through the bayou, childs taking out targets. it's raining harder now.}
<C>__{kendall }
<D>__{all i could think of was west, out there somewhere in the dark. maybe watching the others, maybe watching me. and waiting to make his move.}
<A>__{childs speaks, and kendall almost jumps out of his skin.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{christ, am i alone in this world? shoot something }
<A>__{a sound from the left. kendall panics, pivots, and fires... into darkness. no target, no west, no nothing. kendall, really freaked out now.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{a target, kendall, cap a fucking target. what's wrong with you?}
<C>__{kendall }
<D>__{i thought i was gonna have an attack. go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. childs could tell i wasn't right.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? i will take care of this.}
<A>__{kendall nods and lets childs walk ahead. staring at childs' back as they move on. on kendall's face, thinking...}
<C>__{kendall }
<D>__{maybe it was a trick. maybe this was when they'd get me, when i felt safest.}
<A>__{close. on kendall's finger clicking off the safety again. moving towards the trigger...}
<C>__{kendall }
<D>__{but if i struck first and took out childs, then maybe i could make it out alive...}
<A>__{kendall raises the rifle. sights childs' back. a moment of utter silence and then...}
