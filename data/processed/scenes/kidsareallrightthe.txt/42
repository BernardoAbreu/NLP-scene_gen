<L>__{exterior allgood porch afternoon}
<A>__{everyone sits at the picnic table.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i hope the food's okay. joni told us you own a restaurant.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the food's great. can't go wrong with salmon and corn.}
<A>__{nic finishes a glass of wine as jules takes note.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{so paul, did you always know you wanted to be in food services industry?}
<A>__{paul smiles at nic, trying to disarm her.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, i always liked food.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{no, i was asking because i remember reading in your file, back when we were looking for, you know, sperm, anyway, you said you were studying international relations.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh yeah. wow, that was a long time ago. yeah, i was considering it, but then i dropped out of school.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{you dropped out of college?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah, it wasn't my thing.}
<C>__{nic}
<P>__{(squinching)}
<D>__{no? why's that?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it just seemed like a massive waste of money after a while. i mean, i wasn't "doing" anything. i was just sitting on my ass listening to people spout off ideas i could've just as easily learned reading a book.}
<A>__{paul sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{i'm not saying higher learning uniformly sucks. i mean, college is great for some people.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{joni, i'm sure you're gonna love it. that's just me. i'm just weird that way.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{which is probably why i ended up in the food services industry.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{see what he did there, mom? you said "food services industry," then he said "food services industry..."}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{yeah, i got it, laser. thanks.}
<P>__{(apropos of nothing)}
<D>__{so, paul, what about your social life?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{my social life?}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{you know, are you married, divorced, seeing anyone?}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{mom!}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{what? we're getting to know paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, never been married or divorced. i date a little, but i'm just kind of focused on my work right now.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{paul wants a break from the heat.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so, how'd you guys meet?}
<A>__{jules smiles, embarrassed. nic jumps in.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{we met at ucla. i was a resident in the er and jules had an emergency.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{my tongue went numb.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{thud! we turn to see laser, pounding his head on the table.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{laser, that's not nice.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{what's not nice is subjecting your kids to the same story 1000 times!}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(ignoring laser)}
<D>__{what happened to your tongue?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i don't know. i just lost all the feeling in my face and tongue and i thought i might gag and then, you know...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{choke? die?...}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{yeah...exactly...}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{well it was pretty clear to me she was just having an anxiety attack and she'd be fine.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so what'd you do for her?}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{gave her a vallium. tried to get her to relax, talk, move her tongue around.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{mom, that's gross!}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(ignoring laser, to nic)}
<D>__{actually, she started teasing me and that really helped.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{i was trying to distract you.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i know. and it worked. you were really funny.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{you were really pretty.}
<A>__{nic reaches over and caresses jules' hand. joni rolls her eyes, embarrassed.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{so that's it. my tongue started working again.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{and we've been glued at the hip ever since.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's a great story.}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(beaming)}
<D>__{we like it.}
<A>__{laser and joni share a look.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so nic, i know you're a doctor. how `bout you, jules? what do you do?}
<A>__{jules never likes this question.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{well, i, you know, i studied architecture in college...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{right...}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{but i'm not an architect. i mean i was on my way to becoming one. but i quit before the kids were born.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, that happens...}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{when they got a little older, i started a balinese furniture import business...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{right on.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{yeah. but that didn't work out.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, business aren't easy }
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{actually, i'm in the process of starting a new business.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{good for you. what kind?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{landscape design...}
<P>__{(before he can respond)}
<D>__{but not like a gardener! i mean, yes, there's a gardening component to it, but the real work is to create unique, eco friendly outdoor spaces that harmonize with the surrounding environment. do you know what i mean?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<A>__{in nic's mind, jules is drowning in verbiage. so she jumps in to save her.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{hey paul, did joni tell you about her graduation speech?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, she didn't.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{it was incredible. so full of wisdom and hope...}
<P>__{(turning to her joni)}
<D>__{hon, go get it. i'm sure he'd love to hear it...}
<C>__{joni}
<P>__{(blushing)}
<D>__{no, mom, i'm sure he wouldn't...}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{sure he would. come on. go get it...}
<C>__{joni}
<P>__{(getting upset)}
<D>__{no, it's okay...}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{sweetie, don't be embarrassed.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{i'm not embarrassed! jesus! give it a rest already!}
<A>__{this outburst stuns nic into silence. her daughter has never spoken to her like this. laser stands up.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{i will get the ice cream.}
<C>__{joni}
<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{i will help you.}
<A>__{joni and laser leave the room. nic pours herself the last of paul's petit syrah. jules smiles, covering her anxiety.}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{honey, that's your forth glass.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{actually, it's my third. but thanks for counting.}
<A>__{paul turns to jules, trying to revive the mood.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hey, i was just thinking. you know, i bought this place last year and the backyard's a wreck. would you be interested in working on it?}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(insecure)}
<D>__{oh, that's okay.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, seriously. i don't have time to work on it myself.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{thank you. that's really sweet. why don't you think about it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{why? i just did.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i mean, if you're not up for it that's okay }
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(jumping on it)}
<D>__{no! i am!}
<P>__{(getting excited)}
<D>__{i'm up for it!...}
<A>__{jules smiles at nic: "isn't this great? my first client." nic looks less than pleased.}
