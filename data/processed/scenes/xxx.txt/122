<A>__{he puts his goggles on and pulls the pin from the grenade. then he tosses it over his shoulder. the grenade lands in the snow above him and starts rolling downhill towards him. xander pushes off and starts bombing down the mountain. the grenade bounces after him and then wham! it goes up with a tremendous shock. there is a shift in the snow, a groan of shifting weight, then the entire cornice cracks loose and topples over the brink. xander streaks down the mountain with that wall of snow at his heels. from down below it's an awesome sight. the slack jawed guards watch as tons of churning snow bear down on them. shooting in and out of that powdery mass like a surfer, they can see xander skipping like a stone down the mountain face. there's a mad scramble as guards turn their snowmobiles and ride for their lives. a furious viktor spins around and makes a run for it as well. nobody has a chance. the avalanche is coming like a freight train, frothing like white water. xander blazes right through the scrambling guards and hits a jump. he goes soaring up and lands square on the sloped roof of the outpost. the avalanche is right behind him, slamming down everything and everyone in its way. guards are swallowed up and tossed, snowmobiles go tumbling under the onslaught. xander grabs onto the chimney as the avalanche washes over the outpost. he holds on until the ocean of snow comes to a stop. then it's all quiet. above him the slope is a battlefield of icy rubble. there's nothing moving up there anymore. xander pulls himself free. then he hears a gushing sound and a deep beneath the surface, he sees the warm orange glow of flame. it's viktor and his flame thrower. there's another spurt and the glow fades for good. xander boards to a rock and sits to catch his breath. he's right above the castle now. then his communicator starts to}
