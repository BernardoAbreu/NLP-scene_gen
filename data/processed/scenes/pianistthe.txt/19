<L>__{exterior street leading to ghetto day autumn}
<A>__{a great column of jews of all ages make their way towards the area that will become the ghetto. on foot, on bicycles, on horse drawn platforms, some pushing prams loaded with belongings. a great moving mass of humanity. they're watched on either side of the street by poles. on a horse drawn platform, the szpilmans with their belongings. all wear armbands. szpilman, halina and henryk walk beside the platform with mother, father and regina seated on it. szpilman catches sight of someone among the onlookers, smiles and pushes through the crowd to dorota, close to tears.}

<D>__{dorota!}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{i didn't want to come, i didn't want to see all this, but i couldn't stop myself.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{how are you doing?}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but jurek says they'll let him out.}
<P>__{(stops, tears in her eyes.)}
<D>__{this is disgraceful.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{don't worry, it won't last long.}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{that's what i said, it's so it's too absurd!}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{i will see you...soon.}
<A>__{he smiles and runs to catch up with his family. he looks back, but dorota is lost to sight and the procession continues on its way.}
