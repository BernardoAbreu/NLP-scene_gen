<A>__{indiana runs out of bullets. he sees the car behind getting closer. he tosses the pistol and hits a thuggee in the head. another thuggee retrieves indy's pistol and starts reloading it. suddenly indy is being shot at by his own gun and he yells to short round}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{let up on the brake!}
<C>__{short round}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{indy shoves past willie and takes the brake level from shorty.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{let her go! our only chance is outrunning them!}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what above the curves?!}
<A>__{short round looks scared as indy released the brake and the car hurtles toward a curve. they grab the sides of the car as it tips precariously. behind them, the curve throws the gunmen from side to side in the car following.}
<C>__{short round}
<D>__{indy, look out!}
<A>__{a sharper curve looms ahead and indy shoves the brake completely off!}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what're you doing?! we're going too fast!!}
<A>__{willie closes her eyes as they rocket toward the curve. in the car behind, the thugge guard at the brake also shoves the brake off and looks extremely worried. indy's car hits the curve and the centrifugal force lifts the in side wheels off the rails!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{get over on the other side!}
<A>__{willie and short round jumps over to his side as the car whips around the curve! indy looks back and sees the car pursuing them is also taking the curve at full speed suddenly the thuggee car swereves dangerously, the weight shifts too much to the outside and the car derails! the car bounces off the tracks and flies through the air into a siding where is crashes against a stone wall in an explosion of rock and metal! pieces of debris pommel the drive of the second thuggee car and he quickly grabs for the brake to slow down and avoid the same fate! in the lead car, indy smiles smugly as willie opens her eyes.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{one down, one to go!}
