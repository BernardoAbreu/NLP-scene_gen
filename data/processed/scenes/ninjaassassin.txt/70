<A>__{mika speeds along the autobahn.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{okay, if you're not going to say anything, do you mind if i talk? when i get nervous, it helps if i talk.}
<A>__{he says nothing.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{my name is mika by the way.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{yeah, well usually if someone introduces themselves it is a convention that the other person does likewise.}
<A>__{he considers her.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{raizo...is the name i was given.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{so, you were an orphan?}
<A>__{his head nods slightly.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{interesting nature verses nurture case study i imagine.}
<A>__{he cocks an eyebrow.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{if it's okay with you, i will try to fill in some of the blanks. you must have been taken by the ozunu clan, trained to be an assassin, but something happened and you decided to opt out of the program. i don't imagine this went over so well and since they're after me for just peeking through the keyhole, they must be after you in a major way. but you are also after them or you wouldn't have bothered going to sabatin. which i figure means you're searching for the location of the orphanage because that's obviously the only information battatu's book would have that you wouldn't already know.}
<A>__{he looks at her impressed.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{yeah, i got some moves too. i'm pretty lethal with the research thing.}
<A>__{he almost smiles.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{but here's a question i can't answer: since you didn't know i went to sabatin's, why did you save me?}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{ninja only kill two kinds of people. the first kind has power and money. the other kind is trying to stop them.}
<A>__{he nods, noticing shops out beyond the exit.}
<C>__{raizo }
<D>__{exit here.}
