<L>__{exterior wooded hill day}
<A>__{we see willow's feet as he walks along. he has himself a brand new shoe. spirits high, he treks in the sunshine, papoose strapped to his back. teemo rides in his pocket, while rool straddles the papoose, tickling the giggling baby.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{wait till i tell my children. stuff like this never happens in my village.}
<A>__{he digs a magic acorn out of his pocket and tosses it high in the air. the brownies gasp.}
<C>__{teemo}
<D>__{hey, careful there!}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{how do these work i wonder? i got ta save one to show the high aldwin.}
<C>__{rool}
<D>__{look! death below!}
<A>__{rool points through the trees. willow hurries down the hill to the tree line. in the valley below, 200 nock maar soldiers and calvalrymen battle a hundred ragtag rebel troops. from this sage position high on the hillside, willow watches in disgust. weapons clash and men fall to their deaths.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{daikinis...}
<A>__{they hear a clank behind them. willow slowly turns around. there is movement in the trees. the hillside woods are full of nockmaar horsemen moving right up next to him. in the valley, the oupowered rebels are being forced up the hill toward them. willow is suddenly standing under several large horses and black armored minions. he is frozen in fear.}
<C>__{horsemen}
<D>__{hyaaaaahh!!}
<A>__{swords flash and the horseman charge! the brownies jump and run for their lives. willow stumbles and spins as horse after horse thunders past him, nearly trampling him and the baby to death. the nockmaar reinforcements descend upon the remaining rebels and crush them. willow falls and quickly digs the baby out of the papoose. she is shrieking in ter ror. he holds her tight and runs along the tree line, following the brownies, while the bloody battle rages below.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{let's get out of here. shhh, don't cry, elora. things can't get any worse than this...}
