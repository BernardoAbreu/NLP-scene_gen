<L>__{interior michael's room day}
<A>__{mary is lying on michael's bed. he has just finished putting a regular diaper on her. then michael looks for the tampered with diaper in the box. he finds it, checks that it is well sealed, and places it under mary's bottom. just then agent #3 appears in the doorway. michael calmly finishes putting the dope filled diaper on the baby on top of the other one. mary is cooing. every thing appears normal. however, a trained eye might be very surprised by the enormous thickness of the diaper covering the young lady's backside. but a narcotics agent is not necessarily the most qualified person to notice something odd like this. agent #3 silently observes michael, who gives him a big smile as he slips on mary's pajama bottoms. michael picks mary up and for the first time talks to her in the kind of silly babytalk used by adoring parents.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{okey dokey, honeybunch, it's time to go beddy bye now... we're gonna take a nice long nappy wappy...}
<A>__{he goes back to the living room, followed by agent #3. agent #1 is in the process of showing peter a photograph.}
<D>__{agent #1 do you recognize anyone in this picture?}
<A>__{peter looks: it's the photo of jack and paul that was taken at the beginning of the movie.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{sure. this is jack collins. agent #1 oh yeah? now that's interesting.}
<A>__{michael has laid mary down for a nap in her basket, observed by the five cops. he now sits down, cheerful and bubbling over with enthusiasm.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{so! can i get you something to drink?}
<A>__{agent #1 totally ignores him.}
<D>__{agent #1 so, who's the baby belong to?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{it's jack's daughter. agent #1 and why are you two taking care of her?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{because her mother's in europe for six months, and since jack had to be away for two weeks, i took my vacation to take care of her, i love kids.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah, peter and i just love kids! agent #1 now that's interesting. well, we'll be seeing each other again soon, in fact very soon. in the meantime, i'd appreciate it if you didn't leave new york in the next few days.}
<A>__{all the cops head for the door. michael accompanies them, putting on a very urbane act.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{come back anytime, gentlemen. you're always welcome here. we have no particular plans to leave new york in the near future, so don't worry about us now. 'bye now.}
<A>__{once the cops are gone, michael races back to the living room. peter has collapsed into his armchair.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(in a low tone)}
<D>__{christ, what a mess! they'll be on our tails around the clock! how the hell are we gonna get rid of the goddamn dope?! by the way, where is it?}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(also speaking in a low tone)}
<D>__{it's cool, don't worry, i got it stashed.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{michael points to mary's bottom.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{this way it's close at hand!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{are you out of your mind??}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{relax, will you.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{i diapered the dope on her right in front of the cop and he never noticed a thing!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i told the cops we were taking care of her. you realize we're now stuck with the kid till jack comes back. there ain't nobody coming to pick her up, and i have to go back to the office today!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{wait a minute. you're not gonna stick me with this kid! tell them you need a maternity leave, tell them anything, but we've got to go 50 50 on this!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{and that's not all we haven't heard from the punks yet either!}
