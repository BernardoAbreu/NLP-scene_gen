<L>__{exterior hatch shell shortly after}
<A>__{the crowd is cheering. norah is back out on stage at the piano.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{okay, i'm gonna give my chops a rest here and invite a friend of mine up to the stage. he's gonna sing a song to a very special lady in the audience who he loves very much. let's give a big hand to john bennett!}
<A>__{the crowd applauds dutifully as john walks out onstage. angle on lori and rex. lori reacts, shocked.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{john takes center stage, and looks down at lori.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{uh, hi. um... this is for lori collins. because i love her. this song always reminds me of the most important night of my life. the night we met. it's the theme song from the movie "octopussy."}
<A>__{the band begins playing. "all time high". inexplicably, norah is playing the saxophone with a pair of shades on.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{all i wanted was a sweet distraction for an hour or two had no intention to do the things we've done funny how it always goes with love, when you don't look, you find but then we're two of a kind we move as one}
<A>__{angle on lori and rex. rex is visibly derisive, but we see that lori is softening. it's working...}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{we're an all time high we'll change all that's gone before doing so much more than falling in love}
<C>__{rex}
<P>__{(fake voice, covering his mouth and looking away)}
<D>__{you suck, get off the stage!}
<P>__{(then, for lori's benefit)}
<D>__{hey, come on guys!}
<A>__{the crowd starts to take the cue.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{get off the stage! boooo! you suck! we wanna hear norah! come on!}
<A>__{angle on ted in the wings.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ah, god.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so hold on tight let the flight begin...}
<A>__{angle on a crazed audience member, who rushes the stage, racing toward john.}
<C>__{crazy guy}
<D>__{you're an asshole!}
<A>__{john flinches as he raises the mic stand off the floor at the last second, so the base is sticking out horizontally. the crazy guy runs right into it, bashing himself in the face. he goes down, unconscious and bleeding. everyone gasps as the music stops.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{a few concert personnel rush out to check the guy.}
<C>__{stagehand}
<D>__{someone call an ambulance!}
<A>__{the crowd is now shouting angrily at john. but he is only focused n one spot in the crowd. he sees that lori and rex are gone. almost oblivious to the rest of the frenzy, he sighs, heartbroken. a couple of concert security personnel haul him offstage.}
