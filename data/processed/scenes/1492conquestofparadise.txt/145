<A>__{others follow, wading across, their weapons held above their heads. a crossbow arrow pierces the halberdier. without a cry he falls forward into the water, and is carried away by the current. two more men are hit. one cries out, thrashes around in the water, an arrow protruding from his side. the river stained with blood. still no sign of the enemy. columbus' men nevertheless start to return fire from the bank, creating a shield... others continue to wade across the river. a mutineer is shot down from the branches of a tree... the first men come ashore. musket fire. an exchange of arrows. columbus is now wading across. the man next to him is killed, and carried away by the current. now, on the far shore, the enemy have shown themselves. there is hand to hand fighting, with swords and other weapons. moxica kills one of columbus' men but his own are outnumbered and outmatched. already, some are beginning to surrender. in the midst of the fighting, columbus, sword drawn, pulls himself out of the river: a mutineer lunges at him. columbus kills him with a thrust of his sword and walks forward into the jungle. he spots moxica at the foot of a cliff.}
