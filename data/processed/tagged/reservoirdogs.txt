<A>__{eight men dressed in black suits, sit around a table at a breakfast cafe. they are mr. white, mr. pink, mr. blue, mr. blonde, mr. orange, mr. brown, nice guy eddie cabot, and the big boss, joe cabot. most are finished eating and are enjoying coffee and conversation. joe flips through a small address book. mr. pink is telling a long and involved story about madonna.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{"like a virgin" is all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick. the whole song is a metaphor for big dicks.}
<C>__{mr. blue}
<D>__{no it's not. it's about a girl who is very vulnerable and she's been fucked over a few times. then she meets some guy who's really sensitive }
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{ whoa...whoa...time out greenbay. tell that bullshit to the tourists.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(looking through his address book)}
<D>__{toby...who the fuck is toby? toby...toby...think...think... think...}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{it's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. now granted that's what "true blue" is about, no argument about that.}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{which one is "true blue?"}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{you don't remember "true blue?" that was a big ass hit for madonna. shit, i don't even follow this tops in pops shit, and i've at least heard of "true blue."}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{look, asshole, i didn't say i ain't heard of it. all i asked was how does it go? excuse me for not being the world's biggest madonna fan.}
<C>__{mr. brown}
<D>__{i hate madonna.}
<C>__{mr. blue}
<D>__{i like her early stuff. you know, "lucky star," "borderline" but once she got into her "papa don't preach" phase, i don't know, i tuned out.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{hey, fuck all that, i'm making a point here. you're gonna make me lose my train of thought.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh fuck, toby's that little china girl.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i found this old address book in a jacket i ain't worn in a coon's age. toby what? what the fuck was her last name?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{where was i?}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{you said "true blue" was about a nice girl who finds a sensitive fella. but "like a virgin" was a metaphor for big dicks.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{let me tell ya what "like a virgin"'s about. it's about some cooze who's a regular fuck machine. i mean all the time, morning, day, night, afternoon, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.}
<C>__{mr. blue}
<D>__{how many dicks was that?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{a lot.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{then one day she meets a john holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. this mother fucker's like charles bronson in "the great escape." he's diggin tunnels. now she's gettin this serious dick action, she's feelin something she ain't felt since forever. pain.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{chew? toby chew? no.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{it hurts. it hurts her. it shouldn't hurt. her pussy should be bubble yum by now. but when this cat fucks her, it hurts. it hurts like the first time. the pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. hence, "like a virgin."}
<A>__{the fellas crack up.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{wong?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{fuck you, wrong. i'm right! what the fuck do you know about it anyway? you're still listening to jerry fucking vale.}

<D>__{no, i can't. you know what i heard the other day? "heartbeat it's lovebeat," by little tony defranco and the defranco family. i haven't heard that since i was in fifth fuckin grade.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{when i was coming down here, i was playin it. and "the night the lights went out in georgia" came on. now i ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, i heard it a million trillion times. i'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time i ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed andy.}
<C>__{mr. blue}
<D>__{you didn't know vicki lawrence killed the guy?}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{i thought the cheatin wife shot andy.}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{they say it in the song.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{i know, i heard it. i musta zoned out whenever that part came on before. i thought when she said that little sister stuff, she was talkin about her sister in law, the cheatin wife.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no, she did it. she killed the cheatin wife, too.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{you know the part in "gypsies, tramps and theives," when she says "poppa woulda shot his if he knew what he'd done?" i could never figure out what he did.}
<A>__{the table laughs. the waitress comes over to the table. she has the check, and a pot of coffee.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{can i get anybody more coffee.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no, we're gonna be hittin it. i will take care of the check.}
<A>__{she hands the bill to him.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{here ya go. please pay at the register, if you wouldn't mind.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sure thing.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{you guys have a wonderful day.}
<A>__{they all mutter equivalents. she exits and joe stands up.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i will take care of this, you guys leave the tip.}
<P>__{(to mr. white)}
<D>__{and when i come back, i want my book back.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{sorry, it's my book now.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?}
<A>__{mr. blonde shoots mr. white with his finger. mr white acts shot. joe exits.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{okay, everybody cough up green for the little lady.}
<A>__{everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table. everybody, that is, except mr. white.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{c'mon, throw in a buck.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{uh uh. i don't tip.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{whaddaya mean you don't tip?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{i don't believe in it.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{you don't believe in tipping?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i love this kid, he's a madman, this guy.}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{do you have any idea what these ladies make? they make shit.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{don't give me that. she don't make enough money, she can quit.}
<A>__{everybody laughs.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{i don't even know a jew who'd have the balls to say that. so let's get this straight. you never ever tip?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{i don't tip because society says i gotta. i tip when somebody deserves a tip. when somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. but this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. as far as i'm concerned, they're just doin their job.}
<C>__{mr. blue}
<D>__{our girl was nice.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{our girl was okay. she didn't do anything special.}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{what's something special, take ya in the kitchen and suck your dick?}
<A>__{they all laugh.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{i'd go over twelve percent for that.}
<C>__{mr. write}
<D>__{look, i ordered coffee. now we've been here a long fuckin time, and she's only filled my cup three times. when i order coffee, i want it filled six times.}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{what if she's too busy?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{the words "too busy" shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{excuse me, mr. white, but the last thing you need is another cup of coffee.}
<A>__{they all laugh.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{these ladies aren't starvin to death. they make minimum wage. when i worked for minimum wage, i wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{ahh, now we're getting down to it. it's not just that he's a cheap bastard }
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{ it is that too }
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{ it is that too. but it's also he couldn't get a waiter job. you talk like a pissed off dishwasher: "fuck those cunts and their fucking tips."}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{so you don't care that they're counting on your tip to live?}
<A>__{mr. white rubs two of his fingers together.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{do you know what this is? it's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{you don't have any idea what you're talking about. these people bust their ass. this is a hard job.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{so's working at mcdonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. they're servin ya food, you should tip em. but no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. that's bullshit.}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{they work harder than the kids at mcdonald's.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{oh yeah, i don't see them cleaning fryers.}
<C>__{mr. brown}
<D>__{these people are taxed on the tips they make. when you stiff 'em, you cost them money.}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{waitressing is the number one occupation for female non college graduates in this country. it's the one jab basically any woman can get, and make a living on. the reason is because of tips.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{fuck all that.}
<A>__{they all laugh.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{hey, i'm very sorry that the government taxes their tips. that's fucked up. but that ain't my fault. it would appear that waitresses are just one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis. you show me a paper says the government shouldn't do that, i will sign it. put it to a vote, i will vote for it. but what i won't do is play ball. and this non college bullshit you're telling me, i got two words for that: "learn to fuckin type." cause if you're expecting me to help out with the rent, you're in for a big fuckin surprise.}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{he's convinced me. give me my dollar back.}
<A>__{everybody laughs. joe's comes back to the table.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. wait a minute, who didn't throw in?}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{mr. white.}

<P>__{(to mr. white)}
<D>__{cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, i paid for your goddamn breakfast.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{because you paid for the breakfast, i'm gonna tip. normally i wouldn't.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{whatever. just throw in your dollar, and let's move.}
<P>__{(to mr. blonde)}
<D>__{see what i'm dealing with here. infants. i'm fuckin dealin with infants.}
<A>__{the eight men get up to leave. mr. white's waist is in the f.g. as he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's carrying a gun. they exit uncle bob's pancake house, talking amongst themselves.}
<L>__{exterior uncle bob's pancake house day}
<T>__{credit sequence:}
<A>__{when the credit sequence is finished, we fade to black: over the black we hear the sound of someone screaming in agony. under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car hauling ass, through traffic. over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear somebody}
<T>__{else say:}
<C>__{somebody else }
<D>__{just hold on buddy boy.}
<A>__{somebody stops screaming long enough to say:}
<C>__{somebody }
<D>__{i'm sorry. i can't believe she killed me. who would've fuckin thought that?}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior getaway gar (moving) day}
<A>__{the somebody screaming is mr. orange. he lies in the backseat. he's been shot in the stomach. blood covers both him and the backseat. mr. white is the somebody else. he's behind the wheel of the getaway car. he's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and out of traffic. though he's driving for his life, he keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat. they are the only two in the car.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{hey, just cancel that shit right now! you're hurt. you're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{all this blood is scaring the shit outta me. i'm gonna die, i know it.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{oh excuse me, i didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. are you a doctor? are you a doctor? answer me please, are you a doctor?}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{no, i'm not!}
<C>__{mr. write}
<D>__{ahhhh, so you admit you don't know what you're talking about. so if you're through giving me your amateur opinion, lie back and listen to the news. i'm taking you back to the rendezvous, joe's gonna get you a doctor, the doctor's gonna fix you up, and you're gonna be okay. now say it: you're gonna be okay. say it: you're gonna be okay!}

<L>__{interior warehouse day}
<A>__{the camera does a 360 around an empty warehouse. then the door swings open, and mr. white carries the bloody body of mr. orange inside. mr. orange still is moaning loudly from his bullet hit. mr. white lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{just hold on buddy boy. hold on, and wait for joe. i can't do anything for you, but when joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. we're just gonna sit here, and wait for joe. who are we waiting for?}

<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{look, i don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, i gotta see a doctor. i don't give a fuck about jail, i just don't wanna die.}

<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{i wasn't born yesterday. i'm hurt, and i'm hurt bad.}

<C>__{mr. pink}

<P>__{(referring to mr. orange)}
<D>__{is it bad?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{as opposed to good?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{this is so fucked up. somebody fucked us big time.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{you really think we were set up?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{you even doubt it? i don't think we got set up, i know we got set up! i mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? one minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. i didn't hear any sirens. the alarm went off, okay. okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. in one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. all loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? those were the ones responding to the alarm. but those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you haven't thought about this?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{i haven't had a chance to think. first i was just trying to get the fuck outta there. and after we got away, i've just been dealin with him.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{well, you better start thinking about it. cause i, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. in fact, that's all i'm thinking about. i came this close to just driving off. whoever set us up, knows about this place. there could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. for all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.}

<A>__{at the end of the hall is a bathroom. the bathroom door is partially closed, restricting our view. mr. pink is obscured, but mr. white is in view.}
<C>__{mr. pink }
<D>__{what the fuck am i doing here? i felt funny about this job right off. as soon as i felt it i should said "no thank you", and walked. but i never fucking listen. every time i ever got burned buying weed, i always knew the guy wasn't right. i just felt it. but i wanted to believe him. if he's not lyin to me, and it really is thai stick, then whoa baby. but it's never thai stick. and i always said if i felt that way about a job, i'd walk. and i did, and i didn't, because of fuckin money!}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{what's done is done, i need you cool. are you cool?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{i'm cool.}

<A>__{we hear the sink running, and mr. pink splashing water on his face.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{i'm gonna get me my smokes.}
<A>__{mr white opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and out of frame. we see mr. pink, his back turned towards us, bent over the sink. then he grabs a towels, and dries his face. mr white enters frame with a pack of chesterfields in his hand.}

<D>__{want a smoke?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{the two men light up.}
<C>__{mr. white}

<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{ that's not correct.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{what's wrong with it?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{the cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. they didn't show till after mr. blonde started shooting everyone.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{as soon as i heard the alarm, i saw the cops.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{i'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. they didn't let their presence be known until after mr. blonde went off. i'm not sayin they weren't there, i'm sayin they were there. but they didn't move in till mr. blonde became a madman. that's how i know we were set up. you can see that, can't you, mr. white?}
<C>__{mr. white}

<A>__{mr. pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk. he has a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357 magnum in the other. if any bystanders get in his way, he just knocks them down. we dolly at the same speed, right along side of him. four policemen are running after mr. pink. we dolly with them. we dolly with a young woman on roller skates. rollergirl is plugged into a walkman. we hear the song she's listening to loud over the soundtrack. she's twirling and skating backwards to the beat of the song. rollergirl turns a corner and collides with mr. pink. the man and woman crash to the ground. mr. pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car that screeches to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over him.}

<A>__{the camera is in the backseat. a shocked woman is the car's driver. mr. pink pulls himself up from the hood, shakes it off, and points his magnum at the driver.}

<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{tagged a couple of cops. did you kill anybody?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{a few cops.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{no real people?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{uh uh, just cops.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{could you believe mr. blonde?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{that was one of the most insane fucking things i've ever seen. why the fuck would joe hire somebody like that?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{i don't wanna kill anybody. but if i gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin outta my way.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{that's the way i look at it. a choice between doin ten years, and takin out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. but i ain't no madman either. what the fuck was joe thinkin? you can't work with a guy like that. that mother fucker's unstable. what do you think? do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger happy?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{i think he's a sick fuckin maniac! we're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. i came this fucking close }
<P>__{(hold up two fingers}
<D>__{and makes a tiny}
<P>__{space between them)}
<D>__{ to taking his ass out myself. everybody panics. when things get tense, everybody panics. everybody. i don't care what your name is, you can't help it. it's human nature. but ya panic on the inside. ya panic in your head. ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. what you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{what you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin professional. a psychopath is not a professional. you can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do nexterior i mean, jesus christ, how old do you think that black girl was? twenty, maybe twenty one?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{did ya see what happened to anybody else?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{me and mr. orange jumped in the car and mr. brown floored it. after that, i don't know what went down.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{at that point it became every man for himself. as far as mr. blonde or mr. blue are concerned, i ain't got the foggiest. once i got out, i never looked back.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{what do i think? i think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{not even a chance they punched through? you found a hole.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. but if they did get away, where the fuck are they?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{you don't think it's possible, one of them got ahold of the diamonds and pulled a }
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{how can you be so sure?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{i got the diamonds.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{i got 'em, all right?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{where? are they out in the car?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{no, they're not in the car. no, i don't have them on me. ya wanna go with me and get 'em? yes, we can go right now. but first listen to what i'm telling you. we were fuckin set up! somebody is in league with the cops. we got a judas in our midst. and i'm thinkin we should have our fuckin heads examined for waiting around here.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{that was the plan, we meet here.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{then where is everybody? i say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. we ain't got the slightest fuckin idea what happened to mr. blonde or mr. blue. they could both be dead or arrested. they could be sweatin 'em, down at the station house right now. yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. i mean, that could be happening right now. as we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin here this minute.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{i swear to god i'm fuckin jinxed.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{no shit?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{thank god, we discovered in time. we hadda forget the whole fuckin thing. just walked away from it.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{so who's the rat this time? mr. blue? mr. blonde? joe? it's joe's show, he set this whole thing up. maybe he set it up to set it up.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{i don't buy it. me and joe go back a long time. i can tell ya straight up, joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{oh, you and joe go back a long time. i known joe since i was a kid. but me saying joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. i can say i definitely didn't do it, cause i know what i did or didn't do. but i can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause i don't definitely know. for all i know, you're the rat.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{for all i know, you're the rat.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{now you're using your head. for all we know, he's the rat.}
<A>__{mr. pink points offscreen to mr. orange. mr. white's expression changes.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<L>__{interior warehouse day}
<A>__{they run over to mr. orange, who's unconscious. the camera hovers over the action. mr. pink reaches him first.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{is he dead?}
<A>__{mr. white pushes him out of the way. he feels the pulse on mr. orange's neck.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{so, is he dead or what?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{he ain't dead.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{so what is it?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{i think he's just passed out.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{he scared the fuckin shit outta me. i thought he was dead fer sure.}
<A>__{mr. white stands up and walks over to a table.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{he will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{we can't take him to a hospital.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. that bullet in his belly is my fault. now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. and i'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{well, first things first, staying here's goofy. we gotta book up.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{so what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? we got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{you gotta idea, spit it out.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{joe could help him. if we can get in touch with joe, joe could get him to a doctor, joe could get a doctor to come and see him.}
<A>__{during mr. pink's dialog, we slowly zoom in to a c.u. of mr. white.}
<C>__{mr. pink }
<D>__{assuming we can trust joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? he's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. even if joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians...jesus christ! i tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. if i was him, i'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{before you got here, mr. orange was askin me to take him to a hospital. now i don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. he begged me to do it. i told him to hold off till joe got here.}
<C>__{mr. pink }
<D>__{well joe ain't gettin here. we're on our own. now, i don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{i don't know anybody.}
<C>__{mr. pink }
<D>__{well, i guess we drop him off at the hospital. since he don't know nothin about us, i say it's his decision.}
<A>__{mr. white's pov:}
<B>__{c.u. of mr. pink.}
<C>__{mr. white }
<D>__{well, he knows a little about me.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{you didn't tell him your name, did ya?}
<C>__{mr. white }
<D>__{i told him my first name, and where i'm from.}
<A>__{there is a long silence and a blank look from mr. pink, then he screams:}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{why!}
<C>__{mr. white }
<D>__{i told him where i was from a few days ago. it was just a casual conversation.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{and what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?}
<C>__{mr. white }
<D>__{he asked.}
<A>__{mr. pink looks at mr. white like he's retarded.}
<C>__{mr. white }
<D>__{we had just gotten away from the cops. he just got shot. it was my fuckin fault he got shot. he's a fuckin bloody mess he's screaming. i swear to god, i thought we was gonna die right then and there. i'm tryin to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, i'm gonna take care of him. and he asked me what my name was. i mean, the man was dyin in my arms. what the fuck was i supposed to tell him, "sorry, i can't give out that information, it's against the rules. i don't trust you enough."? maybe i shoulda, but i couldn't.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{oh, i don't doubt is was quite beautiful }
<C>__{mr. white }
<D>__{don't fuckin patronize me.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{one question: do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?}
<C>__{mr. white }
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{well that's that, then. i mean, i was worried about mug shot possibilities already. but now he knows: (a) what you look like, (b) what your first name is,}
<P>__{(i) where you're from and (d) what}
<D>__{your specialty is. they ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. that's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?}
<C>__{mr. white }
<D>__{if i have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.}
<A>__{mr. pink walks out of the c.u. and turns his back on mr. white. mr. white's pov pans over to him.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{we ain't taking him to a hospital.}
<C>__{mr. white }
<D>__{if we don't, he'll die.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{and i'm very sad about that. but some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.}
<C>__{mr. white }
<D>__{that fuckin did it!}
<A>__{mr. white's pov charges toward mr. pink. mr. pink turns toward him in time to get punched hard in the mouth.}
<B>__{end of pov}
<A>__{mr. white and mr. pink have a very ungraceful and realistic fight. they go at each other like a couple of alley cats. as mr. white swings and punches, he screams:}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{you little motherfucker!}
<A>__{mr. pink yells as he hits:}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{ya wanna fuck with me?! you wanna fuck with me?! i will show you who you're fuckin with!}
<A>__{the two men end up on the floor kicking and scratching. mr. white gets mr. pink in a headlock. mr. pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it out. mr. white sees this, immediately lets go of mr. pink, and goes for his own weapon. the two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their guns outstretched, aiming at one another.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{you wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? take a shot!}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{fuck you, white! i didn't create this situation, i'm just dealin with it. you're acting like a first year fuckin thief. i'm actin like a professional. they get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. and you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. i didn't tell him my name. i didn't tell him where i was from. i didn't tell him what i knew better than to tell him. fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. you, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. so if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.}
<A>__{mr. pink lowers his gun and walks towards white.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{so if you wanna shoot somebody, put that gun in your mouth and shoot yourself.}
<A>__{then from off screen we hear:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{you kids don't play so rough. somebody's gonna start crying.}
<L>__{interior warehouse day medium c.u. on mr. blonde}
<A>__{the voice belongs to the infamous mr. blonde. mr. blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke and eating a hot dog.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{mr. blonde! you okay? we thought you might've gotten caught. what happened?}
<A>__{mr. blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter and starts walking around the warehouse, checking the place out. he doesn't look at either mr. pink or mr. white, he just eats his hot dog and sips his coke. this is making pink and white nervous as hell. but mr. pink tries to talk through it. we handhold follow mr. blonde around the warehouse.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{really, how did you get away?}
<A>__{mr. blonde walks the loft. silent.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{you saw what happened to me, i found a hole and booked.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{where's mr. blue?}

"hey, freddy, when's the next time you're gettin some?" "motherfucker, i'm tryin to watch 'lost boys' when i have some, i will let you know." and then these rinky dink pot heads come by there's my friends and everything, but still. i got all my shit laid out in sixty dollar bags. well, they don't want sixty dollars worth. they want ten dollars worth. breaking it up is a major fuckin pain in the ass. i don't even know how much ten dollars worth is. "well, fuck, man, i don't want that much around. if i have that much around i will smoke it." "hey, if you guys can't control your smokin, that's not my problem. you motherfuckers been smokin for five years, be a adult about it." finally i just told my connection, count me out. but as it turns out, i'm the best guy she had, and she depended alot on my business. but i was still sick to death of it. and she's trying to talk me into not quitin. now this was a very weird situation, 'cause i don't know if you remember back in '86, there was a major fuckin drought. nobody and anything. people were livin on resin and smokin the wood in their pipes for months. and this chick had a bunch, and was beggin me to sell it. so i told her i wasn't gonna be joe the pot man anymore. but i would take a little bit and sell it to my close, close, close friends. she agreed to that, and said we'd keep the same arrangement as before, ten percent and free pot for me, as long as i helped her out that weekend. she had a brick of weed she was sellin, and she didn't want to go to the buy alone...}

<L>__{exterior bleachers day}
<A>__{freddy and holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty little league baseball field.}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{okay, we're gonna station men across the street from karina's fine jewelry. but their orders will be not to move in unless the robbery gets out of control. you gotta make sure they don't have to move in. you're inside to make sure that everything goes according to hoyle. we have men set up a block away from the warehouse rendezvous. they got complete visibility of the exterior. so as soon as joe cabot shows up, we'll see it.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{what's your visibility of the interior?}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{we can't see shit on the inside. and we can't risk gettin any closer for fear they'll spot us.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{this is bullshit, jim. i get all the fuckin danger of having you guys in my back pocket but none of the safety.}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{what's the matter, newendyke? job too tough for ya? no one lied to you. you always knew we'd hang back until joe cabot showed up.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{oh this is great. you ain't giving me no fuckin protection whatsoever. but you are giving me an attitude.}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{since when does an undercover cop have protection? freddy, you came into this thing with your eyes wide open, so don't start screamin blind man now. i understand you're nervous. i wish the warehouse had more visible windows, but it doesn't. we have to make do with the cards we're dealt.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{i didn't say i wasn't gonna do it. i'm just remarking on how shitty the situation is!}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{i don't mean to be harsh with ya, but i've found tough love works best in these situations. we have to get joe cabot in the company of the thieves and in the same vicinity as the loot. we don't care about these other bastards. we're willing to offer them good deals to testify against cabot.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{isn't this risk unorthodox?}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{letting them go ahead with the robbery?}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{the whole idea behind this operation is to catch joe cabot red handed. we bust these hired hands, we ain't accomplished shit. letting them go through with the heist is a risk, but cabot's jobs are very clean. we got people surrounding the perimeter. we got a guy and a gal on the inside posing as a couple shopping for rings. we could replace the employees with cops, but we'd run the risk of tipping 'em off.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{that's out. they know the faces of who works what shift.}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{these guys are professionals. we're professionals. it's a risk, but i think it's a calculated risk.}

<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{you two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. we're there for those stones, period. since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. we're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. what if the manager won't give up the diamonds?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{when you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. they're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. if you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's charles bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. drops 'em right to the floor. everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. freaks everybody out. nobody says fuckin shit after that. you might get some bitch talk shit to ya. but give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face nexterior watch her shut the fuck up. now if it's a manager, that's a different story. the managers know better than to fuck around. so if one's givin you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. so what you gotta do is break that son of a bitch in two. if you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. the little one. then you tell 'im his thumb's nexterior after that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. i'm hungry, let's get a taco.}
