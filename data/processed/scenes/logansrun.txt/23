<A>__{black door opens revealing logan and francis who now enter a mammoth room. as they walk. . . they pass four giant lifeclocks...white,}
<B>__{yellow green and red.}
<A>__{each lifeclock pulses out the moments of every person alive in the city, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting to the next lifeclock when the time comes. there are no humans. francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room.... above which is a circular overhang. there is a groove...the shape of a palm crystal on one part of the circular table. francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the dead runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table. (these contents are the ones from the runner francis has killed at the beginning of the film.) the moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanner on the overhang above. francis stands alongside the table...his attitude is very matter of fact. he has been through this procedure many, many times. he touches his head...(the hangover)...and logan smiles. moments later...the scanner stops...the word:}

<B>__{probability}
<A>__{blinks on and off...on and off...catching logan's attention. as logan turns toward the screen...the scanner stops moving. the word probability blinks off and is replaced by the word:}

<A>__{we can tell from logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . . that he has never seen this before. logan sits in a chair in the area facing the screen. there is a stellar groove (that we have seen on the table) the shape of a palm crystal....glowing on an arm of the chair. the word on the screen is now:}
<B>__{identify}
<A>__{logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove. we hear a humming noise....then: the piece of jade jewelry appears on the screen and below the piece of jewelry the following words appear on the screen:}
