<L>__{exterior venice shoreline – late afternoon}
<A>__{a series of intercuts shows activity in and around the pier. a hmeless latino man searches in a trash dumpster. open vendors sell tie dye and water bong paraphernalia. a fat woman walks past eating a hot dog. black gang members play basketball in their low rider shorts and boxers. tight on danny. he skateboards down the boardwalk, performing tricks and spinning the board. from afar, he sees the group of black gang members shooting hoops. he stops, sparks up a cigarette, and watches them play.}

<D>__{venice beach didn’t always look like this. it didn’t. i mean…our dad used to take us down here to run…before he got shot…and it was cool, you know. my brother derek owned this place. since then though…the crips, man—}
<A>__{danny stops as little henry from earlier and older brother jerome catch their breath. danny doesn’t flinch. he and little henry exchange cold eyes. jerome, in a blue bandana, sips from a 40 oz. beer. soon, they both resume playing.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{jerome hastings and his little brother henry. i know jerome’s a shoreline crip and i’m sure little henry’s pretty damn close.}
<A>__{tight on danny. he watches the basketball action as he takes drag after drag off his marlboro red.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{the shoreliners moved west from inglewood and south central and they’ve really just... taken over. especially at my high school. the venice locos are another big gang but they stay in bumfuck mar vista most of the time. and then there’s the the disciples of christ. the d.o.c... kind of a subdivision of the fourth reich skinheads north... but gnarlier.}
<A>__{jerome and little henry argue with the players on the other team. danny’s cigarette crackles sharply.}
