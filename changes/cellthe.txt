She pulls the reins and the horse stops moments before the dune drops into nothingness.  She dismounts, affectionately scratches the horse's neck, and follows the LIGHT.  When she looks over her shoulder, the Arabian is now a child's WOODEN HOBBY HORSE. Not surprised, Catherine smiles and walks down a dune, sand sliding beneath her feet... She finds herself in a valley of dead trees whose decayed, gnarled limbs appear to form hands.  The light dances across her face.  She shades her eyes and pinpoints the source... A SMALL MIRROR reflecting rays of bright sun, housed within a locket and chain.  It's held by EDWARD, a haunted-looking boy of seven with a precocious grin and piercing eyes.  He sits on a fallen tree trunk, patiently waiting for her arrival.}

A bright tungsten work light hangs above, and near it is the chain, cables and hooks of a customized MECHANICAL HOIST. The dog picks up an unpleasant scent and follows it to a far corner where there are empty jugs of BLEACH sitting next to a long, deep cast iron TUB.  Stargher WHISTLES and Valentine obediently retreats to a KENNEL CAGE.  Stargher gives him a chew toy and locks the dog inside before moving to the tub. Soaking in the bleach is the nude corpse of Anne Vicksey. The interior of the tub is glazed with gleaming porcelain and the whiteness of her flesh makes it appear as though she is floating in nothingness, but what hypnotizes and appalls are her eyes.  Wide open, transformed by the chlorine into something ghostly, they are unforgettable. As the bleach gurgles down the drain, Stargher lifts Anne from the tub and carries her to the table.  He places her face up and dries her with a clean white towel.  He moves her limbs, lips, hips, and hands into desired positions then retreats into shadow.  In the harsh light, against the shiny table, the bleached body has the quality of an apparition and we almost expect her to move... We HEAR Stargher remove his clothes and he steps into the pool of light.  Nude, we see that his lean, muscular frame is laced with some rough tatoos.  When he turns his back to us, we find EIGHT METAL RINGS, thick and strong, PIERCED through his flesh.  Two columns of four on either side of the spine, running from shoulder blade to just below the waist.  What in God's name are they for?

A SEDAN travels down a service road and stops nearby.  TWO MEN exit, identify themselves as FBI and move to the crime scene. Special Agent GORDON RAMSEY is well-groomed, prides himself on professionalism, and follows the Bureau party line. Special Agent PETER NOVAK is rough around the edges, introspective, and intense.  A loner who marches to the tune of a peculiar drummer, he's unconventionally handsome with probing eyes.  He moves slowly, observing the scene - the world, for that matter - from a unique perspective. As Ramsey finds the FBI's local liaison - AGENT COLE - Novak oblivious to the people around him, touches dirt, smells the air, and examines road, river, bridge and sky.}

<ACTION>__{with this journey are sections of cloudy blackness and fragmented visions of CATHERINE connected to the apparatus, face masked, DESCENDING into this world. There is an abrupt SHIFT from still images to regular motion and we find ourselves gliding over a tidepool filled with tiny fish and tadpoles.  At water's edge, lying on rough, pebble-strewn ground, is a HAND. Catherine's hand.  We sense MOVEMENT, but she remains still. From the darkness comes a DOG.  Black in color and featureless, it sniffs Catherine, dismisses her, and meanders into a cubicle opposite her, disappearing from view.  After a moment of odd quiet, a DROP OF BLOOD hits the mask and we follow Catherine's hand as it moves to the cloth and removes it from her own face. IN MACROSCOPIC SUPER SLOW-MOTIONS, another BLOOD DROPLET sails 64 into the air and comes crashing down, hitting a RED ANT, catapulting it onto what looks like a tree, but is just a TWIG.  As the insect scurries away, MORE DROPS pound the earth, splatter against "twig trees," and explode into pools of stagnant water... As we begin to realize that this miniature landscape is the world into which Catherine descended. She sits up, shivering, and breathes deeply, acclimating to her surroundings.  The "floor" is covered with filth, ash, pebbles, and insects.  Water is present in many forms, puddles, moisture, dripping ceilings. Eyes focusing, queasy, not fully "awake," Catherine notices the crimson stain on the cloth mask and the blood droplets showering the air.  She turns and finds the source. THE BLACK DOG stands in the opposite room next to a tub full of BLOOD, shaking himself dry after his "bath."  Satisfied, the animal stops and trots away.  Still adjusting to this nightmarish realm, Catherine at first doesn't hear it, but then realizes that somewhere, a child is CRYING.  She looks around, then through a crack in the "floor," briefly catches sight of a BOY beneath her, on a level lower than hers.  As he disappears into corridor ending in "nothing," we PULL BACK to show a MASSIVE LANDSCAPE of blocks, cubicles, crawlspace, walls, stairs, and ladders.  Leading everywhere and nowhere. Catherine spots the boy as he crawls into a specific "room." Shortly after, a LIGHT comes on within the cubicle and she moves to it.

<ACTION>__{Young Stargher knows his way around the landscape, but Catherine has difficulty simply keeping him in sight.  She runs, climbs and crawls.  Until she's utterly lost and disoriented.  Tired and having difficulty breathing, she drops to her knees and "cools down."  She hears a NOISE nearby, gets to her feet, and finds a GEARED MECHANISM connected to some kind of SHUTTERED DOOR composed of an almost metallic-looking glass.  Curious yet cautious, she examines the nearby walls, floor, and ceiling for any signs of "traps" akin to the glass blades.  Finding none, she pulls the mechanism and quickly steps back. The shutter opens and Catherine knows there's something alive in the tiny cubicle beyond.  She retreats into shadow, hiding.  Released from the chamber is a WOMAN.  As she moves out of a darkness, we see VICTIM ONE. Ghostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to "sense" the presence of a stranger, targets Catherine in the shadows, and ATTACKS! Catherine's had enough and moves to press the implant, BUT THE VICTIM IS ALREADY THERE! She brutally grabs Catherine, THROWS her against the wall and SMACKS her head against it.  Catherine drops to the floor like a rag doll. Victim One hefts Catherine onto her shoulder and with great purpose, carries her deep into the labyrinth, toward the core.  Passing in and out of consciousness, between darkness and light, a dazed Catherine is taken on a "tour" of Stargher's world.  Passing mausoleum-like chambers filled with IMAGES of unspeakable horror and/or disturbing intensity.  At one of the rooms, we think we see Young Stargher silently observing... Sitting of standing in individual cubicles are STARGHER'S OTHER VICTIMS (TWO thru SIX), each woman resembling the grotesque porcelain dolls glimpsed in the cubbyholes in Stargher's basement.  Dressed by a fetishistic sadist (Nine Inch Nails meets the Brides of Dracula), they resemble bored housewives, barely acknowledging the new member of the "harem."}

In the dim pool of light above the pedestal, we see a MAN rise from the throne. The wall behind him is covered in BLOOD RED CLOTH, and as he descends, we realize it is a CAPE connected to EIGHT METAL RINGS pierced through the flesh of his back.  In a fluid motion, waves of red give way to harshly textured concrete as the man reaches the floor.  Catherine knows he is there. Unable to stop herself, she turns.

<ACTION>__{Julia tries to hold herself up by pressing her arms and legs against the walls, but as she does, the straw slips from her mouth.  She reaches for it, but only succeeds in pushing it away from her.  It heads for the drain.  And disappears.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE}
<ACTION>__{The helicopter lands and Novak jumps out.  He knows this is the place.  He runs into the barn, but there's nothing, no sign of her.  The pilot looks at him with a true sense of loss.}
<LOC>__{INT. THE CELL - CONTINUOUS}
<ACTION>__{As Julia desperately tires to find the straw through the tiny holes of the drain, we see for the first time an expression which tells us she's given up.  THUMP-THUMP-THUMP.  The cell starts to vibrate.  A repetitive noise WHUP-WHUP-WHUP - comes from above.  She swims to the top of the cell and POUNDS at the ceiling.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE}
<ACTION>__{Fighting exhaustion and the side effects of the drugs, Novak pushes on.  Think, Peter, think... His eyes find the WATER TANKS and he SHOUTS at the helicopter.}

<DIAL>__{Cut the engine!}
<ACTION>__{As the motor dies, Novak listens and listens.  There it is. Water pipes beneath his feet.  And very faintly, a pounding. He follows the sound, searching the earth.  It's clearer now, louder.  Novak tosses aside rusted junk and the pilot runs to assist him.  Together, they expose the entrance to the underground sanctuary.}
<LOC>__{INT. THE CELL - OBSERVATION ROOM}
<ACTION>__{Novak drops to the floor below.  Instantly affected by the similarities and the differences to the idealized cell of Stargher's mind, he feels another wave of dizziness, but pushes on. And is hit hard by the sight of DROWNED JULIA, her motionless body floating past him.  HER EYES OPEN and bubbles drift from her nose and mouth.  Novak BANGS on the Plexiglas and calls to her.}

<DIAL>__{JULIA!}
<ACTION>__{The thick Plexiglass still remains, but she now can see him. Novak pulls his ID BADGE and smacks it against the glass.}

<DIAL>__{MOVE ASIDE!}
<ACTION>__{He pulls his gun and takes aim.  Julia swims to the top of the cell and presses herself against the ceiling.  BANG-BANG BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG.  Novak fires a circle of shots into the thick plastic.  Water slowly leaks, but the damn thing is still solid.  He lifts the industrial VCR and RAMS it at the bullet-damaged section.  CRACK! CRASH!  WATER POURS FROM THE CELL.  Julia's body descends on the torrent of water.  Novak reaches inside and pulls her to safety.  He's just about to give her CPR when she coughs, sputters, and thirstily drinks in oxygen.  Holding her tightly, Novak sinks to the floor, the water from the cell spilling everywhere.}
