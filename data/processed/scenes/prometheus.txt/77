<A>__{fifield stumbles along. exhausted. pouring sweat inside his suit. he is hopelessly lost. he slams into a resinous structure that topples to the floor. things break. he whips his light around in jittery paranoia. taps at his comm controls, getting only static. in fifield's headlamp beam, the blackness is filling with motes of light. a blizzard of tiny flying insects.}

<C>__{fifield}
<D>__{fifield to magellan. come on, come on. anybody, seriously! god damn it!}
<A>__{scarabs flit through the darkness around him. they alight on his shoulders. crawl over his visor. obscuring his vision.}
<C>__{fifield }
<D>__{get off!}
<A>__{he swats at his visor, killing some. the crushed insects produce acid that eats into the plexiglass in seconds.}
<C>__{fifield }
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{he twists, craning with his flashlight to inspect himself. brushes scarabs away right and left. acid opens a hole in his visor. scarabs are inside. buzzing around his head. fifield freaks out, clawing at his helmet. a scarab bites his cheek.}
