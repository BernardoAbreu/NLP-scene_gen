In the distance, BELLS ARE TOLLING   -- the slow, solemn tones that announce a death. A dozen men in scarlet cassocks, ROMAN CATHOLIC CARDINALS, bend down to inspect the ring, nodding in affirmation, part of an ancient ritual. A younger man (the CAMERLENGO) in a black cassock takes a silver knife and scratches the ring's seal twice, once horizontally and once vertically, in the sign of the cross. Now the ring is placed on a lead block.    The Camerlengo raises a silver mallet and SMASHES it down, shattering the ring into a thousand tiny pieces. As the Cardinals confirm to their satisfaction that the ring has been destroyed, the HUSHED VOICE of a NEWS REPORTER comes over the image.}

Langdon looks at the glass wall on the far side of the vault. Then at the row of bookcases.    Gets an idea. He goes to the last bookcase, which is about six feet from the glass wall. He hoists himself up on the shelf of the bookcase opposite it, wedges himself in. And pushes with one leg.      The giant bookcase teeters, but just barely. Langdon hoists himself further up, gets both legs up against the bookshelf. Pushes again -- more movement this time. Now he puts everything he has into it, straining like hell.    The bookcase starts to tip, goes just past the point of no return, starts to fall, gloriously headed straight for the glass wall, which it SLAMS into with enormous power and -- --- stops. Leaning against the wall.     Forget cracks, there's not even a scratch. Langdon CURSES under his breath, looks around for another idea. He hears a soft THUD from the other side of the room, sees Chartrand has slumped over, unconscious. But his jacket has fallen open, revealing the sidearm he carries in a shoulder holster. LANGDON'S HAND slips the gun out of the holster and hefts it.     Safe bet he's never held one of these before. He staggers over toward the glass wall, raises the gun, and pulls the trigger.    Nothing happens.    Trigger doesn't even move. After a moment of oxygen-poor thinking, he figures out how to CLICK off the safety.    Tries again. (Pow.) The sound of the shot is barely audible to Langdon.     His brain's going fast. If he was hoping to bring the whole wall down, he failed, but there's a faint HISSING sound coming from the bullethole, and he goes to it and takes a deep breath of air from the outside. He stands back, his brain clearing momentarily. Seized by an idea, he looks up at the wall, at its four corners, and at the tiny web of cracks radiating out from the hole he just made in the center. He raises the gun again and fires off FOUR SHOTS in quick succession.    They're in an odd pattern-- upper left corner, upper right, not quite as high, lower middle-left, and the very lower right corner. Now there are four new holes, each HISSING slightly, and the first hole, in the center. Shaking his head once more to clear it, Langdon steps forward to the glass wall, but instead of barreling against it or throwing a chair, he simply raises one hand, places it flat over the first hole he made, the one in the center of the glass wall --- -- and presses gently. Almost immediately, a SHARP SOUND comes from the hole beneath his hand and a jagged crack leaps out from the first hole, shooting up to connect with the hole in the upper left corner. He presses just a touch harder and a SECOND CRACK starts, shooting down to the lower right.    Then a third, and a fourth, the glass is cracking like ice in springtime, all four extremities connecting with the central hole, and with a huge GROANING SOUND - - -- the entire glass wall falls to pieces at his feet. Air RUSHES into the vault. And, wouldn't you know it, the power comes back on in the Archives.}

<ACTION>__{Another bullet, another slumping Cop, and FROM LANGDON'S POINT OF VIEW, the van rocks again, but he can't see anything more detailed than that.    All he knows is the two cops aren't coming out from the other side of the van, something is going on -- -- and the bell in the clock tower starts to BONG. EVEN UNARMED,   LANGDON STARTS TO MOVE FORWARD,   JUST AS   -- -- the sliding door on the fountain side of the van SLAMS open -- revealing the figure of the FOURTH CARDINAL, wrapped in chains and with manacled hands and feet.    He thrashes against the iron links, but the chains are too heavy.    One of the links bisects his mouth like a horse's bit, stifling his cries for help.    Mr. Gray hovers over him. Langdon GASPS   -- -- and Mr. Gray shoves the bound figure roughly out of the van. The Cardinal rolls, falling into the fountain with an enormous SPLASH.    His weighted body sinks immediately to the bottom. There is a moment, frozen in time, in which Langdon locks eyes with Mr. Gray, still hunched in the back of the van as the clock tower continues to BONG, the only sound we can hear. Langdon looks at him, then down at the body in the fountain, then back up at Mr. Gray-- -- who salutes him --- -- the van door SLAMS shut, and the van tears ass out of there. Langdon looks from its receding taillights to the idling police car, its door hanging open, he could jump in and give chase, but then his eyes go back to the fountain, where the drowning cardinal must not have much time left, and it's really no decision at all. Langdon covers the distance to the fountain in two quick strides and leaps in. IN THE FOUNTAIN, the water is waist deep and like ice.    Steady streams of bubbles rise up from the bottom, churning it. Langdon reaches the body of the Cardinal, plunges in   -- UNDERWATER, -- and struggles to get both arms underneath the drowning man. Through the watery haze, we can see the man's bare chest, branded with the final ambigram:}

He makes eye contact with the dying man, who seems to be accepting his fate, maybe even welcoming it. Langdon changes his grip, strains like hell, and actually gets him a few inches higher this time, but nowhere close to the air supply. But with the new position, his eyes fall on something behind the cardinal -- a plastic tube, six inches across, streaming bubbles into the fountain. He goes back   --}

Several PASSERS-BY notice the commotion in the fountain as Langdon dives back under the water. UNDERWATER, Langdon drags the body of the Cardinal a few feet across the bottom of the fountain and RIPS the tube free from its mooring, pulling it to the Cardinal's mouth. He clamps it down over the man's lips, and the Cardinal sucks a few greedy breaths from it.    Enough to keep him alive. Langdon takes the tube and draws a couple breaths of his own, then digs his hands back underneath the Cardinal to lift him, but this time -- -- SIX MORE HANDS come in from all sides. Several Passers-by have jumped into the fountain to help, and as they all strain together -- ON THE SURFACE, -- the Cardinal's bound body breaks the surface and he GULPS deep lungfuls of air. He is saved.    Langdon sags against the side of the fountain, exhausted and freezing, as the others pull the Cardinal's body to safety. In the distance, SIRENS.
