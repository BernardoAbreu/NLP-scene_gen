<D>__{yes, my dear. but circumstances have changed }
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{the great detective! well, maybe this case is too small for you }
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{on the contrary. it's being handled at a much higher level }
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{well, i won't go back to brussels. maybe you're giving up, but i'm not.}
<P>__{(tears welling up in her eyes)}
<D>__{i'm going to go on looking for him. and nobody's going to stop me even if they try to kill me.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(looking up from railway guide)}
<D>__{are you quite finished? if you recall, what i said was that we're going to put you on the boat train i didn't say you were going to stay on it.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{she's not?}

<P>__{(moving toward holmes)}
<D>__{thank you. i'm sorry for what i said.}

<D>__{that's not necessary.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<P>__{(smiling through tears)}
<D>__{i will go and pack.}

<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(acidly)}
<D>__{maybe i should do it, since i'm the valet.}
<A>__{holmes replaces the railway guide on the shelf.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{holmes, what exactly are you up to?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{as you like to put it in your chronicles, the game is afoot.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{but what game? are you really that interested in the belgian engineer?}
<A>__{without answering, holmes heads for his bedroom.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{or the wife of the belgian engineer?}
<A>__{holmes, by this time in his bedroom, shuts the door. gabrielle reappears from the other bedroom, carrying a glove.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{you don't like me very much, do you?}
<A>__{she moves toward the couch.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{nothing of the sort. quite the opposite... but there's more to this case than meets the eye }
<A>__{by this time gabrielle has picked up her parasol from the couch, and is obviously searching about.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{looking for something?}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{my other glove.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{let me help you.}
<A>__{he peers under the couch. gabrielle moves toward the window, shakes the parasol, opens it a few times.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{here it is.}
<A>__{he comes up from under the couch with the missing glove.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{she slowly starts to shut the parasol.}
