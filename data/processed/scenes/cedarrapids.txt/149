<D>__{decent. not bad.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{meatloaf's on the dry side.}

<D>__{mm.}
<A>__{tim tries to smile at millie. he is surprised to see that her eyes are filling with tears.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{what's...?}
<A>__{without saying a word, millie struggles to pry the small diamond engagement ring from her sausage like finger. finally, she gets it off and hands it to tim. he thinks of protesting. instead, he takes the ring and puts it in his pocket. millie sniffles a bit, composes herself. tim opens his mouth to say something. before he can think of anything to say: wade sits down with a ridiculously full plate of food.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{shit, where were they hidin' the meatloaf...?}
