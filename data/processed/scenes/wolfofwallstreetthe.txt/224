<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{how was christy's party?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{it was fine.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{baby, i talked to the lawyers again today. i have some really great news. as it turns out you're totally off the hook.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{i know that already.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you never did anything wrong anyway, right? at the end of the day all they really want is for me to cooperate that's it. see, apparently, i know so much about what's going on in the stock market that i could save the government years of heartache. but it get's even better... you see, if i cooperate i will only have to serve four short years and any fine i'd have to pay wouldn't be due til after i serve my sentence. we'll still have plenty of money left over. the only thing that i was kind of upset about was the fact that i might have to give them information about my friends.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{like you said, "there's no friends on wall street".}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{but there's a silver lining to that too... it turns out that all of `em are probably gonna cooperate too. so in the end, that won't really be a factor.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{well, that's really good news, honey. i'm really happy for you.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{no, it's good for both of us, nay.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{yeah, yeah.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{make love to me baby. make love to me nice and slow.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{no jordan. stop!}
