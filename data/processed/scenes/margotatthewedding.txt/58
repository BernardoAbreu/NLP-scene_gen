<A>__{margot and dick sit on stools holding microphones in front of rows of fold out chairs. only a few empty seats remain. pauline and claude sit in the back.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i'm very interested in your story "middle children."}
<A>__{some people applaud, but it trickles off before it gets started.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{the father is a loathsome character yet we also feel a strange sympathy for him.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{yeah, well i was very interested in exploring a father daughter relationship. while he clings desperately to her, suffocates her really, he also silently resents the responsibility of parenthood.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{there's this sexualized push pull with daphne which i find }
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{he craves isolation really. i always thought of him as someone who so over identifies with everyone around him that he begins to lose all sense of himself.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{you make his only recourse to abandon his family, including his beloved daughter.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{right, that's true. that's true.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i write historical fiction so i don't have to answer to this, but i wonder for someone who writes so nakedly about family, how autobiographical is this portrait?}
<A>__{margot rests her lips on the tip of the microphone.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{my father was a loving person. he had his days, of course, but...he was devoted to us as children. i wouldn't have written this portrait were it true.}
<A>__{pauline nods slightly.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{but i'm interested in how the father could be in fact a portrait of you.}
<A>__{margot stares, dumbstruck.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{umm...i don't... why do you assume it's based on... we all take from life. i had to have our refrigerator repaired the other day at our apartment in manhattan. i was alone with a guy, i think he was puerto rican, sent over by...whirlpool, i think it is who made our fridge. although he said he worked for an independent organization who whirlpool subcontracts. i think he was retarded. there was an anger in him and suddenly i became afraid for my life. i called jim at nyu. i asked him to come home.}
<A>__{margot stops. her face is awash in sweat. pauline takes claude's hand and presses it to her chest. his eyes widen, fixed on his mother.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{it might be frigidaire... i'm sorry... i don't... i'm not sure what i'm... i think i need to take a moment...}
<A>__{she stands and walks off the stage. she realizes she still has the mike. she goes back and places it on her seat.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(almost incoherently)}
<D>__{you're an asshole...}
