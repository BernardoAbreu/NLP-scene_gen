<A>__{the door begins to crank open, meg slips through the gap sideways before it's even all the way open. she darts across the room slides to the floor next to the bed and flattens herself, reaching underneath it to get the phone. damn, that phone slid far, it's right in the middle, wouldn't you know it. in the foyer, the three men hear her footsteps, as one, they take off for the stairs. in the master bedroom, meg continues to stretch, her fingers inches from the phone. on the stairwell, feet race up toward her in the master bedroom, meg's fingernails paw the phone, pull it closer to her. she grabs it, stands in the hallway, the three men come off the stairs and race toward her, they see her as she lunges across, toward the panic room, she hurls herself through the door in the panic room, and sarah smacks the red button. the steel door closes with a deafening whang. safe. in the entryway, the echo of the metallic whang reverberates through the house.}
