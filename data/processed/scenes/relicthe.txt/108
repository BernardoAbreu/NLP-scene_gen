<A>__{d'agosta and bailey go in slowly. jonathan stays in the doorway, sweeping the stairwell with his flashlight. kawakita gingerly holds his shotgun. he's scared out of his mind. he turns to jonathan, whispers.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{excuse me. could you tell me how this thing works?}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{oh jesus. don't point it at me. just aim and shoot.}
<A>__{d'agosta heads down the stairs in the lead, with bailey close behind. the stairwell is windowless and dark. d'agosta shines his light and it cuts into the blackness. he moves quietly, makes the first landing and stops. bailey watches his back from several steps behind as d'agosta signals for him to wait. the flashlight flares into a glass door one flight down. d'agosta raises his hand.}

<D>__{hold on. i thought i saw something.}
<A>__{everyone stops. bailey pumps his shotgun. so does jonathan. kawakita fumbles to do like the others. they wait. d'agosta moves alone down several more steps. the silence is heavy. suddenly d'agosta wrinkles his nose.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{whoa... you smell that?}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{lieutenant! get back!}
<A>__{too late. at this something drops from above! a huge dark shape leaps}
