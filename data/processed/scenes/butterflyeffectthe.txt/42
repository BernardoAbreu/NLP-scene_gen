<L>__{interior dr. redfield's offcie day}
<A>__{evan lies on a couch.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{with every breath you exhale, you can feel all of the tension draining from your body like water through a faucet. nine, ten, and you're completely asleep. relaxed.}
<A>__{evan breathes slowly. deeply. andrea watches nervously from the far side of the room.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{now i want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with lenny. think of it like a movie. you can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. understand?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{where are you now?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i'm standing next to kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{are you hurting her?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{no, protecting her.}
<A>__{andrea suppresses the tiniest of proud smiles.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{okay. then go a little forward in time. what do you see now?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i see a car.}
<A>__{evan's eyes suddenly roll back in his head.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{yes, tell me about the car.}
<A>__{evan moans and begins shaking.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{go on. nothing can hurt you. remember, this is only a movie. you're completely safe.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(moaning)}
<D>__{i can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden i'm on the ground in the woods.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{the car doesn't vanish evan. the movie in your head has broken, that's all. but now i've re spliced it and i want you to tell me about the car.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{it's coming... argh! i can't!}
<A>__{evan moans and shakes on the couch.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{fight it evan. hurry. it's coming!}
<A>__{blood begins to trickle from evan's nose as a guttural sound is uttered from deep within him. dr. redfield bolts upright in his chair and redirects the session.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{okay, evan. listen to my voice! on the count of ten, you're going to wake up. feeling refreshed and remembering everything we talked about.}
<A>__{evan moans in agony. andrea darts into the room.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{what's happening to him?? make it stop!}
<A>__{dr. redfield waves her away and concentrates on evan.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{one. you're feeling more awake now. two, your eyes no longer feel heavy.}
<A>__{andrea moves to stop the blood flowing from evan's nose. she lifts evan's eyelids and sees only the whites of his eyes.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{five. six. refreshed and awake! seven, eight. come on, evan, wake up, dammit!}
<A>__{evan is completely non responsive.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{evan wake up, oh please wake up!}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{nine, ten. and you're awake! open your eyes, dammit!}
<A>__{nothing but moans and blood. dr. redfield frantically opens some desk drawers until he finds smelling salts. he breaks a small capsule under evan's mouth, pinches his bleeding nose closed and lets evan inhale the vapor through his mouth. evan lurches forward on the couch and falls off. holding his bloody nose.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what happened? did it work?}
<A>__{evan deduces the answer from everyone's horrified faces.}
