<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{jack and frank dash out of willie's and glance up and down the street. nothing.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we can always look her up in the book.}
<C>__{jack.}
<D>__{right. susie diamond. she's probably listed right next to monica moran.}
<A>__{jack shakes his head in disgust.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{does this mean i get the job?}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{jack and frank whirl around. there, standing in the doorway, is susie.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{intuition.}
<B>__{city skyline}
<A>__{gleaming beautifully at the start of a new day. once again, "jingle bells" is heard, only this time carried a little further: "jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way..." jack, frank and susie ensconsed in the back room of willie's, preparing for their first rehearsal ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{jack nods.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{susie nods. frank poises his hands over the piano, hesitates, then looks at jack again.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{jack squints at frank, then nods. frank turns to susie.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{what are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?}
<A>__{frank g1ares at her.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{frank poises his hands over the piano again and begins to play the opening passage of "just the way you are." a moment later, jack joins in, and a moment after that, susie. unfortunately, jack and frank, accustomed to playing alone, are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a fifth grade recital. after a few bars, susie holds up her hand.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{fellas, fellas ...}
<A>__{jack and frank stop.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{the problem is i can't hear myself sing with all this...}
<P>__{(searching)}
<D>__{... music. you know what i'm saying?}
<A>__{jack and frank look at one another.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i mean, back there it may be hard to notice, but up here i'm having a little trouble getting a word in.}
<A>__{jack and frank just stare.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(icily)}
<D>__{no. we are not supposed to be backing you up.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{what i mean is }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we're a team. we work together.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{so work with me, not against me. okay?}
<A>__{frank stares at susie for a long moment.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i suppose we can bring it down a little.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will drop the eighths.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay?}
<A>__{susie looks at the two brothers.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{willie's showroom later frank is on willie's telephone. in the front of the store, just out of earshot, jack sits at a beat up grand, while susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm telling you, ray. she's got a voice like an angel ... what?}
<A>__{frank glances furtively across the room to where susie, making a very sexy silhouette against the front window, is running her hand over a pearl white piano.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{no, i wouldn't say she's got a body like an angel.}
<A>__{as frank continues to talk in the background, susie looks over at jack.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{hey, he's not sore, is he?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he'll come around.}
<A>__{susie nods, goes back to stroking the piano.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you never sang before?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{not for money. with my mother.}
<A>__{jack nods slowly, but susie sees he doesn't understand.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{she used to waitress downtown, nights, when i was a kid. on the way home, we'd sing. you know how people whistle when they're nervous? my mother sang. she always said you're never alone with a song 'cause thousands of people know the same song and even though you can't hear 'em, they're singing with you. i don't know. if they were, they were all singing safe inside their apartments.}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{but it worked. we always got home. ever since, i always wanted to sing. i never took lessons or anything, though. i guess you guys took a lot of lessons.}
<A>__{jack looks down at the piano in front of him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah. we took a lot of lessons.}
<B>__{jack and nina}
<A>__{jack's tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets ready for the night's gig. nina, standing next to him at the sink, watches as he works up a lather on a bar of shaving soap, then paints his face with the suds.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{you shave like an old movie, jack.}
<A>__{as jack picks up a razor, nina takes the brush and begins to soap her face in the mirror.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{in the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop. then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{is that what you used to do?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{my days are not the old days, genius.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{what are they?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the recent past.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(nodding to the ceiling)}
<D>__{bigfoot gets his out of a can.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i saw his stuff in the bathroom.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i guess it's getting serious.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i hope not. he's already busted the springs in two chairs. hey, what's this?}
<A>__{nina holds up the handle of the shaving brush.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ivory.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{looks old.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{older than me.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{jack gives nina a look, then begins to splash his face. nina picks up the razor.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, what do you want to do? grow a beard?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{what's a prom?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ever go to church?}
<A>__{nina nods.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's like that. only you gotta dance.}
