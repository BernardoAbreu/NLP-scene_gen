<L>__{exterior medieval village' day}
<A>__{the villagers cease their activities as they listen to the sound. looking up, they smile, as if warmed to their souls by some unearthly and intangible substance. they look heavenwards. camera follows their collective gaze skywards. we shoot up, up, into the sky.}

<D>__{there was this little prince with a magic crown. an evil warlock kidnapped him, locked him in a cell in a huge tower and took away his voice. there was a window made of bars. the prince would smash his head against the bars hoping that someone would hear the sound and find him. the crown made the most beautiful sound that anyone ever heard. you could hear the ringing for miles. it was so beautiful, that people wanted to grab the air. they never found the prince. he never got out of the room. but the sound he made filled everything up with beauty.}
