<L>__{interior christy's cell midnight}
<A>__{christy is lying flat out on her bed, in her habit, utterly exhausted by the week's hard labor. there is a meek scratching at her door.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(without moving)}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{sister mary robert enters, very shyly. she barely looks up.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{what? what does she want now? i did the dishes. i oiled the pews. i dusted the hymnals. two hundred hymnals. why can't people share?}
<C>__{mary robert}
<P>__{(not speaking above a whisper)}
<D>__{i... i...}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{i... i brought you something.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{a cigarette?}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{an extra heel of bread. please take it, you need your strength. you've been working so hard.}
<A>__{mary robert holds out a rather rugged crust of brown bread. christy takes it..}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{thanks. so which one are you? sister bruce? sister doug?}
<C>__{mary robert}
<P>__{(until almost whispering)}
<D>__{mary robert. i'm... mary robert.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{right. okay. bob. nice to know you.}
<A>__{mary robert nods, and resumes looking at her hands. she doesn't leave, but she's still tongue tied. christy is at a loss.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{so, bob, how long have you been in? st. k's?}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{three years. sister.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{three years. a rookie.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{a novice.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{yeah, like a learner's permit, right? when do you hit the big time? you know, when do you take the final vows?}
<A>__{mary robert bursts into tears.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{whoa! bob! what's going on here? what'd i say?}
<C>__{mary robert}
<P>__{(still sobbing)}
<D>__{you have to help me}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{right, sure, but what's the problem? are they keeping you a prisoner here? do they drug you? did reverend mother like, kidnap your parents? we can call the enquirer.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{no, you don't understand i don't want to get out! i want to get in?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{oh. mary clarence, i'm so unworthy. i want to take my final vows, i would do it tomorrow, but reverend mother won't let me!}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{she won't? why not?}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{she says i should wait. she says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life. she says that i'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet. in a mature manner.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{she said that? reverend mother?}
<A>__{mary robert nods, solemnly. suddenly, from the streets outside the convent, we hear a blast of hot dance music, and the sound of laughter and carefree conversation.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{well, then there's only one thing to do.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{reverend mother says you need experience, right, in life. in order to make a responsible decision. this is going to be very painful for me. you know how much i love this little room. this whole convent. wait.}
<A>__{christy stands, and goes to the crucifix hanging on the wall. she speaks to the crucifix, and listens, as if jesus is advising her.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(to jesus)}
<D>__{must i do this thing, 0 lord? please help me.,. yes, i know... i must put my selfish cares aside... i must think of others... yes, she's here...}
<P>__{(she gestures to mary robert)}
<D>__{he says hi... yes, i understand... let thy will be done. amen. you too.}
<A>__{christy turns to mary robert, having received a holy message.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{we must do this sacred thing, mary robert.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{of course! we must do it! it's the will of god! what is it?}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(shutting her eyes,}
<D>__{for the full spiritual}
<P>__{effect)}
<D>__{we must... get you some experience. we must... leave this place.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<A>__{another blast of music from the street. christy turns to the crucifix. she gets confirmation.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(to jesus)}
<D>__{we hear you.}
