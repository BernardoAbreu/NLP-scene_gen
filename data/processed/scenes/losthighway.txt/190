<A>__{pete slowly moves up to a sitting position, then stands. he stretches and walks around the yard feeling the dry, unwatered lawn on his bare feet. he walks over and leans over the neighbor's fence. his eyes fall on a plastic toy boat floating in b child's plastic swimming pool. he watches the boat as the warm breeze blows it lazily in a circle. a small plane drones overhead. in the distance, a woman finishes hanging out some wash and goes in the back door of her house. the slamming of her screen door sounds a thousand miles away. pete continues to observe these seemingly peaceful surroundings but something doesn't feel right to him.}
