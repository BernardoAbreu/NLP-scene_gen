<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{she's... sick.}

<C>__{dutton}
<D>__{if you had a license, i bet i'd have seen it by now. how old are you? fifteen?}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{look, i will tell you the truth. jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but i mean... look at her.}
<A>__{dutton leaves that dangling. circles around to the passenger side...}
<C>__{tracy }
<P>__{(whisper to jannie)}
<D>__{get up, get up...!}
<A>__{dutton opens jannie's door, leans in, slides a hand between her slightly parted legs. dutton smiles at tracy.}

<D>__{look, can i just call a cab?}
<C>__{dutton}
<D>__{what did i say?}
<A>__{tracy bends over the car trunk. dutton eases her feet apart with the tip of his boot then pulls out his nightstick, uses it to lift her tiny skirt slowly up over her butt. as he does, she stands back up, shakes her head "no."}
<C>__{dutton }
<D>__{maybe i will ask your friend.}
<A>__{tracy's frantic, about to call out as dutton moves to the passenger door, opens it and... over dutton alex sits in the passenger seat now. jannie shunted inward.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(mimicking dutton)}
<D>__{i want you... to bend over. officer dutton.}
<A>__{dutton pulls his 9mm baretta on alex.}
<C>__{dutton}
<D>__{where'd you come from? out of the car. now!}
<A>__{with insolent slowness, alex finishes writing... "the list" a red line drawn through dutton's name. alex gets out of the car. dutton slams the door and janie stirs, coming to. at least a bit.}
<C>__{dutton }
<D>__{hands on the car.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{question. these hands?}
<A>__{alex advances on dutton.}
<C>__{dutton}
<D>__{you're dead, ditch weed.}

<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{omigod, omigod...}
<A>__{jannie's head pops up inside the car. she screams at... jannie's pov alex right in her face, nice and dead. dutton lowers his gun bg. tracy in a panic. suddenly, alex opens his eyes, smiles. face distorted against the glass. she screams again.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you're up.}
<A>__{alex wheels around, wrenches dutton's wrist, vise gripped. dutton's gun falls to the ground.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{ladies. drive carefully.}
<A>__{tracy rushes to the driver side.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{you might want to call 911. report an officer down.}
<A>__{tracy screeches off leaving dutton in shock.}
<C>__{dutton}
<D>__{that was a fucking hollow point!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i guess it's true. guns don't kill people...}
<A>__{alex draws the knife the murder weapon from his costume.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{think maybe knives do?}
<C>__{dutton}
<D>__{keep that thing away from me.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{this is not just some "thing." it's a c zero zero five.}
<C>__{dutton}
<D>__{you're the skel broke into the evidence room.}
<A>__{flash. the knife moves and rip! alex yanks the sleeve off dutton's uniform, revealing a scarless forearm.}
<C>__{dutton }
<D>__{fuck! what do you want?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{a scar. on the arm. of the man who planted this in alex corvis's car.}
<C>__{dutton}
<D>__{there's no scar, you freak. the corvis kid made it up.}
<A>__{alex glitches, hearing this a second time, then rams dutton into a wall with a great clatter of trash cans. alex all over him, holding dutton's head firmly in his two hands, like he could crush it in an instant.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{he was innocent. you framed him. you. and erlich. and larkin. and toomey. what do you think, officer dutton? an eye for an eye?}
<A>__{alex's thumbs inch toward dutton's eyes, grazing dutton's eyelids now and a wild thing happens. flash! alex's internal pov dutton's nightstick lifts lauren's skirt. then flashs of a bloodsoaked struggle, lauren's death. and the surprise bam! of a shot fired. resume alex thrown by this. relaxes his grip on dutton.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{you were there. all four of you.}
<A>__{dutton kicks him off, smashes a garbage can over alex's back then pulls a small semi auto from an ankle holster.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{you killed her. i saw it.}
<C>__{dutton}
<D>__{bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. if she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{so you're right, spooky. happy?}
<A>__{bam! alex barely slowed by the shot, advancing, dutton starting to panic. bam! alex keeps coming, right up to the gun. pointed right at his face, then... whoosh. alex flips it around, rams the gun in dutton's mouth. he couldn't talk if he wanted to.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm working on it.}
<A>__{bam! we hear the blast as we... cut to:}
