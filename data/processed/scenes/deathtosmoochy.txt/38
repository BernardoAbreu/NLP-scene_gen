<L>__{interior angelo pike's rundown apartment}
<A>__{(lower east side) night we met him backstage with smoochy... innocent face... angelo stirs a pot of soup in the worn down but tidy apartment. a "rhinette" costume is draped over one of the chairs. there is a sudden loud pounding on the door. angelo puts the spoon down and reaches behind some spices on the shelf above. he pulls out a revolver. the pounding continues.}
<C>__{angelo}
<D>__{yeah, who is it?}
<C>__{randolph }
<P>__{(friendly)}
<D>__{open up, buddy! it's me, randolph! it's been a long time!}
<A>__{angelo puts the gun in his waistband and walks to the door. he slowly slides the chain off and opens the door a crack. peering in at him are the bloodshot eyes of rainbow randolph.}
<C>__{angelo}
<D>__{randy?}
<A>__{randolph suddenly kicks the door open and tackles angelo. randolph sits on top of the little man.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{you fucking traitor! my body's barely cold and already you work for the rhino?}
<C>__{angelo}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{don't lie to me! i heard all about it! you strapped that horn on faster than a cheerleader gets the clap!}

<C>__{angelo}
<D>__{rhinette!}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{say it: i am a krinkle kid! say it, before god! on the soul of jesus christ! say what you are!}
<A>__{angelo punches randolph in the mouth and flips him over. he now sits on randolph, pointing the revolver to his face.}
<C>__{angelo}
<D>__{i'm a rhinette. got that? the krinkle kids are ten feet under. with you.}
<A>__{randolph starts crying like a child.}
<C>__{randolph}

<A>__{angelo sighs and puts the gun away.}
