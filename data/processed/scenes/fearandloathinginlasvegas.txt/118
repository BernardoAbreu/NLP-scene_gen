<A>__{duke enters the dark, cluttered interior. scattered all about the store are bits of americana... old barrels, wagon wheels, wooden yokes. a stuffed horse hangs from the rafters. the sunlight shafts through high windows. an old man is repairing an iron pot bellied stove near the wooden bar. a norman rockwell painting... only real.}

<B>__{relaxes.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{hard to find it served like this anymore.}
<A>__{as he drinks, duke toys with a rack of key chains little american icons... a remington cowboy, a bugs bunny, a tweety pie, betty boop, a baseball player. the logo on the rack reads: american dream key rings.}
