<A>__{multi cultural conference pool deck fourth floor gene looks at his watch.}
<B>__{ecu watch}
<L>__{12:32.}
<A>__{the minute hand clicks to 12:33 as he watches. angle on huey 12:33pm he works away at gene's shoes.}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{so, are you a visitor or lucky enough to live in the city of angels?}
<A>__{it's more of huey's patter, no real substance to the inquiry.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{i'm...i'm visiting.}
<A>__{gene watches mr. smith frown and amble toward the shoeshine stand.}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{what do you do, if i may be so bold?}
<C>__{gene}
<P>__{(looking at mr. smith)}
<D>__{i'm just an accountant.}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{don't denigrate yourself, my friend. where would the government be without accountants? they wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?}
<A>__{angle on mr. smith 12:33pm he takes note of the conversation and wanders back to his chair. angle on huey 12:33pm}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{now you take tips. time was a tip was between a man and his customer. not any more. they've figured out what they call a formulae, don't laugh, it ain't for babies. they take your sales, see, and slap a percentile on there, figuring that somewhere between your lies and your bad luck they'll hit on the mean amount, mean meaning "in the middle", but if you ask me it means "just plain mean". why you can have uncle scrooge wring a nickel over your poor out stretched palm, or daddy warbucks dropping pearl stick pins like manna from heaven, don't make no difference, they'll tax your behind according to that same figure. doesn't seem quite right., does it?}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{no. no, it doesn't.}
<A>__{the bellboy gustino walks by, calls out to huey.}
<C>__{gustino}
<D>__{hey, huey, how's it hangin'?}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{it's a load, my friend, but somebody's got to carry it.}
<A>__{gustino laughs, waves.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{i have to do something.}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{what's that? you have to speak up.}
<P>__{(taps his ear)}
<D>__{i'm a little deaf in this ear. between that and my wooden leg i'm a mess. compliments of the united states army artillery corps.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{i said i have to do something.}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{i will have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{is within himself.}
<A>__{gene i keep wondering what she would do if she was here. she'd figure it out. she'd run it down like a column of numbers. pro's and cons. that's the way she was: lists all over the house. huey's manic shoe shining slows down: who has he got in his chair?}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{drove me crazy. there must have been one on me. i didn't add up so she left. that's what attracted me to her in the first place. she made up her mind and she did it. she wouldn't sit around waiting for...whatever. she'd do something. she'd do something.}
<A>__{huey keeps his eyes on his work. he's afraid he's got a live one.}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{yes, well, you know, for a quality shoe you can't beat a good wingtip. wears like iron. you're a wise man. there ya' go. two bucks.}
<A>__{huey gestures for gene to get down. gene steps to the floor. he pays huey with a twenty.}
<C>__{huey}

<C>__{gene}
<D>__{can i get out to flower street from here?}
<C>__{huey}
