<A>__{flor sitting on the sand...listening to her tapes..continually forced by chum's obsessive persistence to throw him the ball.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior beach house late night}
<A>__{as john arrives...he bumps the walls on entering.}
<L>__{interior beach house late night}
<A>__{as john enters the house, clearly drunk. there is the sound of skittering paws as chum approaches.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(cheering)}
<D>__{hey, boy, i can use some up company.}
<A>__{but chum feverishly digs his snout against a nearby piece of furniture and retrieves a tennis ball and rockets away. john follows, weaving a bit.}
<L>__{interior beach house den late night}
<A>__{as john enters the room to find chum proffering the ball to flor who is watching one of video language tapes. she tosses the ball without a look or a thought..then starts when she sees john standing there. he cheers, seeing her predicament. when she speaks english, at this point, her words are halting.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you gotta do something about chum..your arm's going to go.}
<A>__{she waves it off and hurries to get her tape and get out of his way. chum complicates the task, proffering the ball. flor wearily throws it.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{don't you sleep anymore?}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{no..you get more if you keep at it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're doing fantastic.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{now i am like a three year old. your wife go out.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{she say where?}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(on his reaction)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{listen..i just forgot she was going out..don't be a smart ass.}
<P>__{(jolted by his own remark)}
<D>__{uh oh..well, you and i communicate mostly in apologies anyway..i'm sorry. i should be whipped. i should be stoned it's been a while i meant to say, i think, don't be smart, don't be kind, don't be sensitive, don't be beautiful. i meant to say, "hi, flor, good night flor..that show you're watching is going to be a hit."}
<A>__{he staggers out. flor watches his lonely back for a beat and then urgently gestures chum to join him. chum is reluctant, but relenting, runs and accompanies his appreciative master. flor, now alone, finds herself staring at a framed picture of john in the den. he is younger and smiling. she studies the picture and then blinks when she realizes her own emotion and purposefully goes back to her lessons.}
