<A>__{renai lies in bed, awake...a broken shell of her former self. a bottle of anti depressants sits on the bedside table. josh enters the bedroom. sits down beside her.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{look at me for a second, honey.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look at me.}
<A>__{she doesn't look up.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{did you really believe what she said? in your heart of hearts, did you actually take what she was saying literally?}
<A>__{a long beat of silence passes.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{do you think i don't want to believe in that stuff? of course i do. it would make life a lot easier if i did. if i believed that some supernatural force was responsible for what's happened to our son...}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{i don't believe anything anymore, josh. i used to. i used to believe that i could keep my children safe. i used to believe everything would be okay. to believe in something, you have to know it to be true.}
<A>__{she turns and looks at him.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{the things that have happened to me haven't confirmed any beliefs they've done the opposite. they've made me question what i believe.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{they've made me realize that maybe we don't know as much as we think we do.}
<A>__{josh paces, at his wits end.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{you ask me if i believe what she said to be true and the answer is i don't know. but let me ask you this in your heart of hearts, can you say for certain that it isn't?}
