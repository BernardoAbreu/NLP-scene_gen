<L>__{interior pyramid hub}
<A>__{a junction where multiple passageways converge. milburn and fifield trudge into the space, trundling the probe cases behind them. tunnels lead away in all directions.}
<C>__{fifield}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{milburn}
<D>__{grand central station.}
<A>__{they open the case. camera probes tumble out: spheres the size of softballs, studded with lenses and sensors. tiny lights come on as the probes awaken. they roll off, dispersing to investigate every passageway. bumbling into walls and pillars, reversing. exploring by random walk.}
<C>__{fifield}
<D>__{let's check the feed. gimme the map.}
<C>__{milburn}
<D>__{you had the map unit.}
<C>__{fifield}
<D>__{you don't have the map?}
<A>__{they stare at each other.}
<C>__{milburn}
<D>__{are you serious?}
<A>__{he trudges back the way they came, in disgust.}
<C>__{milburn }
<D>__{come on.}
<B>__{core chamber door}
<A>__{david stands on top of one of the cargo rovers. he's cut a hole in the wall beside the door, high up: he works with probes in the mechanisms inside.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{looks like a three state switch.}
<A>__{a deep boom, echoing inside the ancient walls. nothing moves.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{one moment...}
<A>__{he moves a control. boom. the immense door begins to rise. pyramid core chamber the vast central chamber of the pyramid. an immense space. holloway walks in, his flashlight searching. watts hurries after. the others follow, rovers tagging along. a colossal structure stands in the center of the chamber, convoluted and strange. a mechanism. chasms yawn in the floor all around it, their depths lost in darkness. the explorers enter, rovers in train. they lift their eyes: hundreds of feet above them they see the pyramid's apex from within. a shaft of diffuse light penetrates the pyramid somewhere near the peak.}
<C>__{ravel}
<D>__{this is something, now.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes. yes, it is.}
<A>__{the android's awareness is keyed to a high pitch. he seems to read meaning in the inscrutable structures all around them. holloway hauls a drone case out of the rover. two dozen spherical drones tumble out, wake up, and roll off into the dark. they are nimble, hopping curbs and skirting chasms. watts looks at her atmosphere sensor. astonished.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{martin. this air's breathable.}
<A>__{the core chamber brightens as the sun outside moves into alignment. the shaft of light perfectly centered. a vast sigh as if the pyramid itself is breathing. a fat drop of water falls on watts's glove. she looks up in surprise. another falls on her visor. and then it's raining inside the pyramid. water trickles into the chasms, inundating the mossy growths that cling to the walls. holloway looks at watts with a little boy's grin.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{miracles and wonders!}
<A>__{the shaft of light moves on. the core chamber dims slightly. the rainfall stops as suddenly as it started. the explorers follow the main path around the periphery of the chamber, past a gallery of mysterious machines. there are marvels in the shadows. cells in the dark apparatus open on startling deposits of color: translucent alabaster flutes. honeycombs of pure gold. matrices of crystal. watts waves a scanning instrument as she walks.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{intense field readings. huge power sources here.}
<A>__{pyramid core chamber ramp they arrive at a wide opening in the floor. a strange ramp curves downward its floor segmented and saw toothed. a bafflement: it's not a staircase. not an escalator. no moving parts. no rails or tracks.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{space below us. a big space.}
<A>__{as they stand looking, a probe bumbles up to the opening and goes bounding down the ramp. watts laughs.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{how does this work?}
<A>__{she begins to descend on foot. holloway behind her. stillwell, downs, and kamarov grudgingly follow. but david looks away across the cavernous chamber fixated on the central crystal. he beckons ravel and chance to follow him, and walks away. ravel and chance look at each other in astonishment. uncertainly, they follow david.}
<C>__{lower passage}
<A>__{holloway, watts, and the crewmen reach the bottom of the ramp, breathing hard. a cargo rover trundles down after them. they look back up. the ramp above them is empty.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{ravel. chance. where've you gone? david! where are you?}
<P>__{(to watts, indignantly)}
<D>__{they didn't come down!}
<A>__{but watts is staring through an archway. transfixed.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{look.}
<A>__{she walks in. holloway follows.}
<C>__{control concourse}
<A>__{a passageway punctuated by alcoves as big as band shells. in each alcove stands a biomechanical apparatus shaped from the same dark material as the pyramid itself. each apparatus implies by its design that a giant is meant to fit inside it. holloway and watts walk the concourse, playing their lights over the dark machinery. their footsteps echo.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{do you see, the size of them? like that ghost we saw...}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{it wasn't a ghost. where are the others? i don't want to go back up.}
<A>__{watts fiddles with her suit's comm controls. listening.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{they switched to channel three. i hear them talking. they're okay.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{we should stay together.}
