<L>__{exterior william's terrace day}
<A>__{the two of them on the rooftop terrace, passing the day. william is reading 'the bookseller.' the terrace is small and the plants aren't great but it overlooks london in a rather wonderful way. spike still in scuba gear, goggles on.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{there's something wrong with the goggles though...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no, they were prescription, so i could see all the fishes properly.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{groovy. you should do more of this stuff.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{so any messages?}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{yeh, i wrote a couple down.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{two? that's it?}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{you want me to write down all your messages?}
<A>__{william closes his eyes in exasperation.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{who were the ones you didn't write down from?}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{ahm let's see ahm. no. gone completely. oh no, wait. there was one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right. no one else?}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{absolutely not.}
<A>__{spike leans back and relaxes.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{though if we're going for this obsessive writing down all messages thing some american girl called anna called a few days ago.}
<A>__{william freezes then looks at spike.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{what did she say?}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi it's anna and then she said, call me at the ritz and then gave herself a completely different name.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{which was?}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{absolutely no idea. remembering one name's bad enough...}
