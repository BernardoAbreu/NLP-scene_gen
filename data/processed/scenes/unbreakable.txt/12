<L>__{interior emergency room afternoon}
<A>__{david dunne's eyes slowly open. the dull white of the overhead tube lighting}
<B>__{blinds him at first.}
<A>__{he blinks his vision back. he realizes he's in a bed. we hear agitated voices, movement. david looks around. he's in an emergency room. there are a half dozen prep areas and beds next to him. they're all empty.}
<B>__{david follows the urgent sounds of activity to a prep area directly across from him.}
<A>__{he can only see glimpses of activity through the drawn curtain. a group of emergency room personnel are treating a man whose body is twitching violently on a gurney. one of the group is a man who glances through the opening in the curtain. he notices david sitting up from across the room. the man in scrubs leaves the group and walks over.}
<C>__{man in scrubs}
<D>__{how are you feeling?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{he flashes a light in david's eyes.}
<C>__{man in scrubs}
<D>__{you are in the emergency room of the university of pennsylvania hospital. you were in a serious accident.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how's your vision?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{david stares across as the scene with the other patients becomes more frantic and disturbing.}
<C>__{man in scrubs}
<D>__{where were you sitting on the train?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{against a window.}
<C>__{man in scrubs}
<D>__{in the passenger car?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes. where are the rest of the passengers?}
<C>__{man in scrubs}
<D>__{was your family traveling with you?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{man in scrubs}
<D>__{did you get up from your seat?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{david watches the other patient.}
<C>__{man in scrubs}
<D>__{you're certain you were in the passenger car?}
<A>__{david turns to the man.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes... why are you looking at me like that?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{man in scrubs}
<D>__{your train derailed... some kind of malfunction... it took a curve way to fast. a second train collided with yours after it derailed. the debris is spread over one mile. it's unbelievable they said.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they only found two people alive so far... you and him.}
<A>__{david looks to the other passenger now laying unnaturally still in the desperate whirlwind of activity around him.}
<C>__{man in scrubs}
<D>__{the man's skull was cracked open and most of his left side was crushed.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{man in scrubs}
<D>__{and to answer your question, there are two reasons why i'm looking at you like this.}
<A>__{david turns and stares at the man.}
<C>__{man in scrubs}
<D>__{one, because it seems, in a few minutes, you will officially be the only survivor of this train wreck.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and two, because you don't have a scratch on you. you didn't break one bone.}
