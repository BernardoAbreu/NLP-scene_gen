<L>__{interior enviromental control}
<A>__{data and ensign porter enter through a set of doors. the lights are off in the room, dim. this is a large room crammed with many conduits, gas tanks, 24th century machinery and monitors. it's normally unmanned this is where oxygen, gravity, heat, and other environmental conditions of the ship are controlled. in a far corner of the room a conduit leading to a series of high pressure tanks labeled "d o2" has ruptured and is spewing a corrosive, poisonous gas. data scans it with his tricorder.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(to porter)}
<D>__{one of the diathermic oxygen tanks has been damaged.}
<C>__{porter}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{diathermic oxygen?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{it is a new subsystem of nova class ships. it regulates hydropressure and temperature variance.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{remain here. the gas is highly corrosive to organic material. it would liquefy your flesh on contact.}
<C>__{porter}
<D>__{be my guest, sir.}
<A>__{data walks over to the spewing gas tank, and without concern shoves both hands into the corrosive gas... ... groping around for the broken conduit, finally grabs hold of it... and with android strength bends the metal conduit back into the bulkhead. the gas stops leaking. data is completely unaffected by the corrosive gas.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(to porter)}
<D>__{begin a diagnostic on the safety interlocks. there appears to have been some damage during the attack.}
<C>__{porter}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{porter moves around a corner, behind some equipment, out of data's vision... new angle porter who opens a panel on the wall. but instead of the neat and orderly starfleet technology, he is confronted by a bizarre amalgam of organic and mechanical cabling, diodes and what almost look like arteries. some of the tubes are pulsing with fluids and energy. porter reacts.}
<C>__{porter}
<D>__{what the hell...}
<A>__{porter pulls aside a large conduit and stops. buried deep within the tangle of bio circuits is what looks like a human face covered with cybernetic tubes and chips. it's barely discernable in the darkness and clutter. porter isn't even sure what he's looking at. he leans in for a closer look... and suddenly the eyes open.}
<B>__{data}
<A>__{who hears a thump and a sickening liquid crunch from off camera. he takes a few steps in that direction.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{ensign porter?}
<A>__{he stands there for a moment, puzzled. then a faint skittering scrape can be heard like tiny claws on a metal surface. he whirls at the sound.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{ensign... are you all right?}
<A>__{no response. data walks around the now deathly quiet room... turns the corner to where porter was working. he's gone. the open panel is still there, and there doesn't appear to be any place porter could've gone. data looks puzzled, takes a step forward when his boots make a squishing sound. he looks down...}

<D>__{data to security.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this is lieutenant data to anyone who can hear my signal. i need assistance in the environmental control room.}
<A>__{nothing. data quickly turns and heads for the door. there's a metallic scrape above him and he looks up }
<B>__{two borg}
<A>__{are climbing to the ceiling like two spiders ready to pounce. one of them has porter and appears to be inserting some horrible borg device into his head. before data can react, the second borg suddenly lunges at data.}
