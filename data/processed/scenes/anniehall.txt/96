<L>__{exterior outdoor caf day}
<A>__{people sit at umbrellaed tables with checkered tablecloths at a sunset boulevard outdoor cafe. street traffic goes by while they dine. there's a mild california breeze. the restaurant is somewhat crowded as alvy makes his way around the tables looking about. he finally sits down at an empty table; nearby sits a woman with a younger man. a waitress brings alvy a menu and waits for his order.}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(to the waitress)}
<D>__{i'm gonna...i'm gonna have the alfalfa sprouts and, uh, a plate of mashed yeast.}
<A>__{annie, wearing a flowered dress and wide hat, moves into view. alvy, noticing her, watches as she walks over to his table. he rises and they shake hands.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{alvy wipes at his nose as he stares. he smiles, the street traffic moving behind him. annie smiles back.}
<C>__{alvy}

<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, no, i just lost a little weight, that's all.}

<P>__{(reacting, alvy looks down at his hands, then up)}
<D>__{i'm able to enjoy people more.}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{so whatta you ... you're not gonna come back to new york?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{what's so great about new york? i mean, it's a dying city. you read "death in venice."}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{hey, you didn't read "death in venice" till i bought it for yuh.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{that's right, that's right.}
<P>__{(still smiling)}
<D>__{you only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(nodding his head and gesturing)}
<D>__{that's right, 'cause it's an important issue.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? i mean, your life is new york city. you're just this person. you're like this island unto yourself.}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(toying with his car keys)}
<D>__{i can't enjoy anything unless i ... unless everybody is. i you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's ... you know, i i ... it puts a crimp in my evening.}

<D>__{so wanna get married or what?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{no. we're friends. i wanna remain friends.}

<P>__{(then nodding)}
<D>__{yes, of course i'm mad, because you love me, i know that.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{alvy, i can't say that that's true at this point in my life. i really just can't say that that's true. i mean, you know how wonderful you are. i mean, you know ... you're the reason that i got outta my room and that i was able to sing, and and and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. anyway, look, i don't wanna listen, listen, listen, uh}
<P>__{(laughing)}

<D>__{look, i gotta go.}
<A>__{she starts to rise.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{you mean that ...}
<P>__{(he gets up and starts following her past diners at other tables)}
<D>__{i i i i flew three thousand miles to see you.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i'm late.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{air miles, you know. i mean, you know what that does to my stomach?}
<A>__{they move down the steps of the cafe' toward the parking lot.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{if you must know, it's a hectic time for tony. the grammys are tonight.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{the grammys. he's got a lotta records up for awards.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{you mean they give awards for that kind o' music?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh!}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{i thought just earplugs.}
<A>__{annie gets into her car. alvy moves over to his rented convertible.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{just forget it, alvy, okay? let's just forget the conversation.}
<A>__{she closes the door, starts the motor.}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(yelling after her)}
<D>__{awards! they do nothing but give out awards! i can't believe it. greatest, greatest fascist dictator, adolf hitler!}
<A>__{annie drives away. alvy gets behind the wheel, starts the motor. putting the car in gear, he inadvertently moves forward, hitting a bunch of trash cans with a loud crash. putting the car in reverse, alvy notices a beige car that has just turned into the parking lot. for a brief moment, the screen shows a flashback of the bumper car ride at the brooklyn amusement park. alvy's father is on the platform directing traffic; young alvy is in a small car bumping others right and left. alvy, hack in the parking lot, backs up his convertible, purposefully smashing the side of the beige car as another flashback of bumper car ride appears, this time as, alvy's father directs traffic a marine in a small car bits the back end of a soldier's car, and alvy, back in the parking lot, moves his car over to another parked car and bits it full force. another flashback appears. people in the small cars really racing around the track now, bumping into one another over and over again, alvy's father directing the flow, as the film cuts back to the parking lot, where alvy reverses the convertible and rams it into the front end of yet another car. he sits behind the wheel as people rush out of various cars and as sirens start blaring, coming closer and closer, stopping finally as a motorcycle cop gets off beside alvy's car and walks over to him.}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(getting out of the car)}
<D>__{officer, i know what you're gonna say. i'm i'm not a great driver, you know, i i have some problems with with with }
<C>__{officer}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{may i see your license, please?}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{sure.}
<P>__{(searching, he finally fishes his license out of his pocket)}
<D>__{just don't don't get angry, you know what i mean? 'cause i i have i have my my license here. you know, it's a rented car. and i've ...}
<A>__{he drops the license and it falls to the ground.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{don't give me your life story}
<P>__{(looking at the piece of paper on the ground)}
<D>__{ just pick up the license.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{pick up the license. you have to ask nicely 'cause i've had an extremely rough day. you know, my girl friend }
<C>__{officer}

<D>__{just give me the license, please.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{since you put it that way.}
<P>__{(he laughs)}
<D>__{it's hard for me to refuse.}
<P>__{(he leans over, picks up the}
<D>__{license, then proceeds to rip it up. he lets the pieces go;}
<P>__{they float to the ground)}
<D>__{... have a, i have a terrific problem with authority, you know. i'm... it's not your fault. don't take it personal.}
