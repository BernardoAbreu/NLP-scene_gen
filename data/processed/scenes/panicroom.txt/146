<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{junior reaches the door of the kitchen, tries to open it, realizes it's screwed shut. he takes out a screwdriver and starts unscrewing the screws. burnham stops at the stairway.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{you walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{yeah, whatever.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{i mean it!}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{adios.}
<A>__{he gets the last screw out, throws open the door, and blast of wind gusts in, it's a blustery night out there, he takes a step into the doorway and with a quiet pffft from right behind burnham, a bullet whizzes across the kitchen and hits junior in the back of the head. he crumples, right in the open kitchen doorway. burnham shouts incoherently and turns. raoul is standing there, two steps up, a silencer twisted onto the barrel of his gun.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{nobody leaves.}
