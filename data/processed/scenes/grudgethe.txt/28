<A>__{karen hangs up, putting the phone down on the kitchen table. she leans against the counter, exasperated. then her attention turns to the book she found in the closet. karen can't resist. she opens it. the book is a large journal, filled with elegant japanese writing. karen flips through it, stopping on a photograph. a handsome young man, smiling at the camera. we recognize him. it's peter, from the opening scene.}
