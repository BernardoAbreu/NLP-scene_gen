<L>__{interior frank carter's house bedroom night}
<A>__{an unmade bed with pyjamas on it, a beaten up wardrobe, a dressing table and chair are about it. carter hears a vehicle stopping on the street below. he eases back the ancient net curtain. two men in a land rover are looking up. they see him and quickly drive off. carter looks around the room. on top of the wardrobe there's an old shotgun. he reaches up and brings it down. memories flood back. he reaches up again and finds a box of cartridges. more memories, jack and frank grew up here. he leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing.}
