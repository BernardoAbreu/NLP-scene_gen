<L>__{interior foster home tv room night}
<A>__{five kids are gathered around the room in various stages of sleepy grumpiness and annoyed disbelief. jacob paces back and forth.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{i don't get it. is this guy alive or dead?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{he's neither. he haunts your dreams and if he kills you, you die for real.}
<A>__{wesley, the most gullible of the group, looks pretty scared.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{i haven't dreamed of him. i have nightmares like you wouldn't believe, but never of this guy.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{that's because this all rates an eleven on the bullshit meter! i don't know why we have to listen to this crap. you're scaring the hell out of wes here.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{keep your voice down.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. the ross's sleep like rocks, which is what we all should be doing.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i know this sounds crazy, but i swear it's true. i went to bed one night and woke up in the middle of the road. freddy krueger killed my mother, blasted my whole town into his nightmare, and, worst of all, i think he wants to use me to kill more kids and bring more towns into his world.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm not sure. i think i'm some kind of carrier. he's somehow inside me and as soon as i fall deep enough into sleep he'll be let loose. you guys were great to take me in. i just don't want to thank you by getting you all killed.}
<A>__{scott gets up and goes to a desk. he pulls out a map and shows it to jacob.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{okay. show me springwood.}
<A>__{jacob looks at the map and points.}
<C>__{scott }
<D>__{there's nothing there.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{that's what i've been trying to tell you.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{there's never been a town there.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{that's how you see it. i was part of the nightmare, so i'm the only one who notices the difference.}
<A>__{scott stares at jacob. he actually grows sympathetic.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{look, jacob. you don't have to convince us that nightmares are real. everybody in this room has been through one. and some of us are still living it. but the thing is, we know it's just in our heads now. it can be just as bad as the real thing was, but it's still only a memory. it can't hurt us physically, unless we do the hurting ourselves.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{and we don't want to see you get hurt.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{we know it gets crazy. and we'll help out the best we can.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{but this is just too hard to believe.}
<A>__{jacob plops down on the couch, defeated. he hangs his head while the kids start to get up. wesley gives him a pat on the back as he, scott, and gina leave. but karen is still here. she sits next to a window with a faraway look in her eyes. jacob looks up at her.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you don't believe me, either, do you?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{why are you still here?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm not sure. i guess, i guess i see a lot of me in you.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{feels good to see someone more fucked up than yourself, huh?}
<A>__{karen smiles and sits down next to him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yeah. that must be it.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{but you haven't told me why you're here at this place.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i can't talk about it right now. maybe later. do you want me to stay with you?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah, that'd be great. don't let me sleep, okay?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i will do my best.}
<A>__{she reaches for the remote control and flicks on the tv, moving a little closer to jacob when she sits back into the couch. the two of them watch the screen with glassy eyes.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{thank god for cable tv.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah. thank god.}
<A>__{they continue to watch in silence as karen takes hold of jacob's hand.}
