<D>__{... began with a redskin end around, but cochran, the pulling tackle ran into falco's pitchout ... see? madden (v.o.) (cont'd) right here, it bounced off his helmet. then it was kicked by landon and then hayes touched it, i think, and then green got a hand on it, and then bellinski recovered it and then he lost it, and finally the ball took a crazy bounce right back into falco's hands, look at his face here. he's as surprised as anybody! falco then ran it back to just about the original line of scrimmage, executed the same play an end around to murray and the skins score. welcome to strike football!}
