<L>__{interior alley night}
<A>__{trevor runs into the alley, seeing no signs of the stranger. the end of the alley is pitch black.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{where's my wife?!}
<A>__{trevor hears something at the end of the alley. he grabs a broken bottle out of a garbage can and heads toward the darkness. trevor's teeth are bared now.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{where's my wife!?}
<A>__{something glistens in the dark just before the razor sharp edge of a switchblade touches his left jugular. trevor freezes. out of the shadows comes... bret.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{bret... what the fuck...?}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{tonight was supposed to be the night, trevor. remember? i couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{bret. what the hell is going on?}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{we were gonna be millionaires you said. nobody'd suspect a thing. i had never even met her. no connection. then you went and had that fucking car accident.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{bret you are making no sense whatsoever.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{i followed her trevor. i got to know her life. and what a boring one it was. six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for trevor to come home. and wait and wait and wait. nine o'clock get ready for bed.}
<C>__{bret }
<D>__{ten o'clock fall asleep in front of the tv. she did that every day i followed her. every single day. while you were out fucking your concubines. every day i felt more and more bad for her, man. and hated you more and more.}
<A>__{trevor is absolutely speechless.}
<C>__{bret }
<D>__{then i find out you're having nooners with my gwen. that was all i could take. i didn't want to kill your wife anymore. i wanted to kill you. even before that little accident i decided to do it on the day we'd set aside for her.}
<A>__{bret presses the blade against trevor's neck a little harder, drawing a rivulet of blood.}
<C>__{bret }
<D>__{but now that ain't gonna happen either. i fell in love with kirsty trevor. the day she died it was like my soul had been ripped from my body. not just because i lost someone i loved. it's because the child inside her... was mine.}
<A>__{bret then puts the knife to his neck.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{bret drags the knife across his own jugulars slicing them open. blood pours out of his smiling mouth. then something really weird happens. cuts begin to open up all over bret's face and his hands. blood pouring to the ground in buckets. bret lifelessly falls into the pool of blood... before he can process what's just happened, trevor hears a noise behind him and turns to see... several of those slithering sewer monsters coming toward him, surrounding him. and behind them, several silhouetted figures walking slowly toward him. we don't need three guesses to figure out who they are... cenobites. panicking trevor reaches down and grabs the knife out of bret's hand and readies himself for the inevitable attack when the blinding light from a police car illuminates the alley. first trevor notices the sewer monsters are gone. then the figures we thought were cenobites are actually lange and several police officers. lange looks disappointed.}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{okay trevor. put the knife down.}
<A>__{trevor does so. two cops rush up to trevor and one swings his baton down just over trevor's eye crack!}
<B>__{lights out.}
