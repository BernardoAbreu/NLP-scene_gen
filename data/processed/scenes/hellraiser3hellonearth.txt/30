<L>__{interior main room, joey's apt. early evening}
<A>__{joey is sitting behind a desk. she has a phone in one hand and a pen in the other. spread out over the desk are various documents the photo of kirsty, the diagram of the box, type written transcripts etc and a scratch pad on which joey has scrawled several numbers. joey is in mid conversation on the phone.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{yeah ... yeah ... yeah ... no, it's important that i speak to ... what? no, don't ... (a beat) put. me. on. hold. you. stupid. bitch.}
<A>__{joey slams the phone down. she stares at the papers, at the scratch pad, takes a deep breath, and punches out a number on the phone. this time joey's voice is different.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{hi. now listen. and listen good. i'm the station manager at w qqy. for the last half hour you've been dicking around with my assistant. let me tell you something. with or without your co operation we are making this expose. i assume you're smart enough to guess which version is going to make you look good. now, if you can't put one hand on that cassette and the other on a fedex man's butt within thirty seconds then you damn well better put me through to somebody who can.}
<A>__{a pause while somebody jumps through hoops at the other end. joey's voice transmogrifies again; now it's a seductive, persuasive purr.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{dr. fallon? how nice of you to take my call. i understand you're in charge of video archive from the channard institute ... ?}
