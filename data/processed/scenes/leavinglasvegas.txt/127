<L>__{interior main bar, hotel night}
<A>__{a lounge singer belts out a fair rendition of a tony orlando number. sera sits at the bar, an empty seat on either side of her. she watches a younger hooker in the final moments of pulling a dangerous looking man. the girl is aware of sera without even looking at her. the guy she is with looks around and sees sera. the girl shoots an icy look. a man sits next to sera: a conventioneer.}
<C>__{conventioneer}
<D>__{about ready for another drink?}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{yes, that would be great. are you her for the convention?}

<A>__{they shake hands.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{no, of course not, just a wild guess. i'm sera and that's a margarita. the barman is already pouring. the young hooker leaves with}
<A>__{her dangerous guy. she pauses long enough to give sera a nasty smile. the conventioneer pays for the drink and is a little lost for words. sera tries to help.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{so... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?}
<C>__{conventioneer}

<C>__{conventioneer}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{a date. what, are you a hooker?}
<P>__{(voice getting louder)}
<D>__{what do you mean a date?}
