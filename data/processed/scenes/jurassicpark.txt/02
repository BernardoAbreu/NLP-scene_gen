<T>__{wash out to:}
<A>__{hot sun overhead in a big sky }
<L>__{ext badlands afternoon}
<A>__{lodged in the cracked earth are the partially exposed fossilized remains of a velocirapter, a carnivorous dinosaur. widen out to a sweeping panorama of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs, scribbling notes, and conferring with each other. the center of all this activity is one man. in a roped off area that circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is dr. alan grant, head paleontologist. good looking, late 30's, with a think beard. grant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone. a group of twelve students, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence. close on the tiny bone. grant's nose touches it. grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush. then he decides on a quicker way to clean it. he licks it. excited by his discovery, he gets to his feet and addresses his students, who listen raptly.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{right calcaneus of an adult female raptor. mild stress fractures. what's this tell me?}
<A>__{students look at each other. a tentative hand. grant continues.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{it tells me that this bone connects to the navicula which we already found articulating to the cuboid.}
<A>__{offscreen, a woman shouts to him.}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{dr. grant! dr. grant!}
<A>__{grant looks up. dr. ellie sattler, late 20's, sharp eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs like a gazelle across the arid land. exuberant, she leaves a trail of dust behind her. she zips by a student guarding the cordoned area. he tries to stop her.}
<C>__{student}
<D>__{dr. sattler! dr. grant is thinking!}
<A>__{dr. grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{so, what can we stay for sure? stress fractures in the heel ...}
<A>__{uncertain students. ellie arrives and immediately gets into it.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{she jumps.}
<A>__{grant turns around to her and smiles. she's got it. other students to they knew is all along.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{right as rain, ellie. now, why did she jump?}
<A>__{no answer. ellie gives it a try.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{a defensive posture against a vicious, blood thirsty t rex?}
<C>__{grant}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{perhaps. or maybe to select the smaller, more tender leaves in the higher branches with which to suckle her young?}
<A>__{ellie jumps up.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i bet is was a mating ritual.}
<A>__{students laugh. one student eyes grant's self conscious smile at ellie.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{the science of paleontology can't answer these questions. novelists and artists who dream a vision of the jurassic period can attempt these questions with their imaginations. what we scientists can say is considering the mass and kinetic articulation of these bones, this animal had a vertical leap}
<A>__{of about twelve feet.}
<D>__{not as entertaining as fiction, but absolutely fact without prejudice.}
<A>__{ellie intrudes again.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{excuse me, dr. grant. but ... fact is, we're late. there's the car.}
<A>__{she points. on the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a dusty wake. grant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually as ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{jim, you keep making up the plaster batches. whatever ratio you're using, it's perfect. nora, no digging after five when the temperature drops, those bones are just too brittle. bill, i don't want any tourists walking over my raptor i don't care if the governor of montana is with them, just you guys.}
<A>__{grant and ellie continue walking. she interrupts his continued barrage.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{you know, if ev}
<A>__{ery scientist stuck to his}
<D>__{method like you, there would be no body of theory no quasars, no big bang }
<A>__{grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{jesus, a limousine. we're re entering}
<P>__{hammond's world, that's for sure. (beat)}
<D>__{remind me why we're doing this, ellie.}
<A>__{ellie is gentle. she's telling him something they've discussed before.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{we're leaving the raptor dig }
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{ at a critical time }
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{ because gennaro is paying us sixty thousand dollars to observe some resort of hammond's in costa rica. and that's }
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{ enough money to keep us free of commercial affiliations for two summers. all right, all right. good.}
<A>__{then, half kidding with ellie:}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{financial}
<A>__{independence for fraternizing}
<D>__{with the enemy? (beat) i will do it.}
<A>__{she laughs. but he can't quite leave. he grabs a computer printout}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{this is all could come up with, skip?}
<A>__{skip turns the printout right side up in grant's hand. grant smiles.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{wise guy. let's go, ellie.}
<A>__{grant and ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students. the limo pulls away.}
