<A>__{kafka comes out of the building. he hears a noise, turns around, sees burgel and the girl on the tiny baroque balcony outside her room. kafka retreats into the shadows. he watches the girl unwrap the parcel burgel's given her. she smiles as a box of chocolates is revealed.}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{watches with an expression of guilt, sadness? until a door suddenly opens at his back. a man shuffles out past him. a rather ugly woman in a dressing gown holds the door open, giving kafka a cursory look. beyond her inside, a quick glimpse of masochist yelping as he's whipped.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{well, what're you waiting for?}
