<A>__{letters big as a house. and loud. the printer reciprocates as fast as its mechanics are capable. details coming in from san diego. vicap case number f.b.i. case number victim status etc etc. letters smacking into paper too fast to read. but one de tail is repeated constantly and underlined. "identity unknown." transmission ends and berlin hauls at least a yard of homicide out of the machine. can't believe what he's looking at. "jesus. he hit six." reads as he walks back into the big room and gets interrupted by a call. "miss robertson. holding." he heads for the phone with eyes following ann "find ross for me, will you?"}
<C>__{berlin }

<A>__{a hand shoves papers at the edge of his vision. taylor looks a mite cheesy. "you got a minute for this?" and berlin nods sure.}
<D>__{yes, i'm still here .. why didn't you mention that? .. i see .. al right, we should talk again .. no, i'm just south of my eye lids in it right now .. how about sunday?}
