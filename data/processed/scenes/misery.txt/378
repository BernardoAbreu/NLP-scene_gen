<A>__{buster. hearing paul's muffled call for help, he tracks the sound to the cellar door. as paul continues to call out, buster looks around, sees no one, and opens the cellar door. the shaft of light from the open door pours down on paul, who is still lying on the floor.}
<C>__{buster}
<D>__{mr. sheldon?}
<A>__{but before paul can answer, there's the sound of a loud explosion. seemingly from nowhere a hole is ripped through buster's chest, knocking him out of frame, revealing annie, smoking shotgun in hand, standing at the top of the cellar steps.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{don't feel bad, paul. it had to happen. i've been waiting for this sign.}
<A>__{annie walks toward buster's body and very casually takes his gun out of its holster.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i've known for some time why i was chosen to save you. you and i were meant to be together forever. but now our time in this world must end. but don't worry, paul. i've already prepared for what must be done. i put two bullets in my gun, one for you and one for me. oh, darling, it will be so beautiful.}
<A>__{with that, annie turns and exits the cellar. paul's mind races desperately. he looks at the barbecue again. next to it is a messy table with a dozen jars and cans on it.}
