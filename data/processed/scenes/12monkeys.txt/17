<L>__{interior engineering office future world eternal night}
<A>__{ushered in by two guards, tiny and scarface, cole looks around. cole's pov: wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts... a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfaces heaped with cracked monitors, gerry rigged computers held together with string, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, a dilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of moldering books and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conference table, staring at cole, six scientists: an astrophysicist, engineer, botanist, microbiologist, zoologist, and a geologist. they represent a "modern" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude, outdated, patched together technologies.}

<D>__{james cole. cleared from quarantine.}
<C>__{microbiologist}
<D>__{thank you. you two wait outside.}
<C>__{scarface}
<D>__{he's got a history, doctor. violence.}
<A>__{cole's eyes return to the walls. headlines: "clock ticking! no cure yet!"}

<D>__{anti social six doing 25 to life.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{i don't think he's going to hurt us. you're not going to hurt us, are you mr. cole?}
<A>__{cole's head turns quickly to the engineer.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<A>__{the guards exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.}
<C>__{microbiologist}
<D>__{why don't you sit down, mr. cole.}
<A>__{cole goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.}
<C>__{astrophysicist}
<D>__{we want you to tell us about last night.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i went to the surface and i collected specimens like i was told.}
<A>__{the scientists don't say anything. they just study him carefully.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{i mashed the spider, didn't i?}
<C>__{microbiologist}
<D>__{we'll get to the spider later, mr. cole. right now, we want to know everything that you saw.}
