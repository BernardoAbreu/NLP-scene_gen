<A>__{moran climbs from his vehicle, as carl's young sons dash around the corner of the house. seeing the sheriff, they stop cold. silent, shirtless, barefoot.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{hey there, men. is your mother home a tall?}
<A>__{he spits his juicy fruit into a wrapper. and as the younger boy nods across the distance...}
<C>__{susan marie }
<D>__{sheriff moran, hullo.}
<A>__{she has appeared in the doorway, smiling, spittle marked baby's diaper across her shoulder. and he smiles back. tells the boys...}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{you go on and play, now.}
<A>__{but they don't. so he follows into her entryway, closing the door behind him. and at the foot of her curving staircase...}

<D>__{we found him, mrs. heine. tangled in his net.}
<A>__{and with these words, a slack, blank look crosses her face, and she stumbles back one step, sitting down hard on the bottom stair of her curved staircase. he doesn't know what to do. she digs her elbows into her lap, and begins to rock, very slowly, wringing the diaper in her hands. her face is more terrible than tears. it is frightened. she murmurs to herself, so that we can barely hear...}
<C>__{susan marie}
<D>__{i told him this could happen.}
