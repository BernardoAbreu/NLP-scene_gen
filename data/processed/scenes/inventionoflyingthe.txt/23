<L>__{interior lecture films mark's office morning}
<A>__{mark's office is completely boring and unremarkable, much like his apartment. there's a knock on his door. anthony enters, looking very much the boss in his expensive suit, yet nervous and fearful as well.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{wow, you look really depressed today. that's going to make this so much harder.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{anthony, don't fire me.}
<A>__{anthony sits down on the other side of mark's desk and leans forward.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{mark, the 1300's are boring. nothing interesting happened in that century. nobody cares about the post roman, pre enlightenment era. the last few scripts you turned in were depressing.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{they were about the black plague! it's the 1300's anthony, what else am i going to write about!}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{it's not totally your fault, mark. you got stuck with a bad century.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no! i can make it work!}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{give it up mark, it's not like something new is going to have happened in the 1300's. at lecture films we're no longer interested in searching through the less well known historical periods for great events, we just want to take the big name reader's of the day and have them read the historical events that people know and love: the holocaust, d day, the birth of electricity. these are the stories people want to see, because they know them. they find comfort in them.}
<A>__{anthony pauses.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{do you think i could come back and do this tomorrow? i just got very nervous about firing you. i don't do well with confrontation.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{is there anyway you could do it now? i'd rather not put it off.}
<A>__{anthony thinks for a moment, struggling to find the courage.}
<C>__{anthony}
<P>__{(meekly)}
<D>__{you're fired?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{damn.}
<A>__{anthony slinks out of the room. mark looks down at his computer to see he has an email in his inbox. angle on: mark's computer the email reads: "i woke up this morning, sober, and realized that, while i did enjoy your company, based on your looks, your financial situation and your position in life, i have no interest in you romantically. i'm just too far out of your league. jennifer" mark sits back in his chair and sighs deeply.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{she's a really good writer, too.}
