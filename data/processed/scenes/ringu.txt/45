<L>__{interior ryujis apartment afternoon}
<A>__{ryuji and asakawa enter the living room.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{so, whatd you come up with?}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{i dont think any of the guests on the list brought the tape with them. i couldnt confirm it face to face of course, but even over the phone i got the feeling they were all being upfront with me.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{how about the other angle? pirate signals or...}
<A>__{asakawa shakes her head.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{therere no traces of any illegal television signals being broadcast around izu.}
<A>__{she reaches into her purse, pulls out a large white envelope.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{heres that copy of the videotape you wanted.}
<A>__{ryuji tears the package open. he squats down on the tatami in frontof his tv and slides the tape in. asakawa sits on the tatami as well, but positions herself away from the tv and keeps her eyes averted. ryuji glares over his shoulder at her.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<P>__{(sternly)}
<D>__{asakawa.}
<A>__{she reluctantly scoots closer, looks up at the screen. ryuji fast forwards the tape a bit, stopping at the scene where the woman is brushing her long hair before an oval mirror. he puts the video on frame by frame.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{have you ever seen this woman?}
<A>__{asakawa regards the screen intently.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{the tape advances to the scene where the mirror suddenly changes positions. when it does, we can again see the small figure in the white gown, a figure with long black hair. when ryuji sees this his body stiffens, becomes tense. asakawa notices but says nothing. she also notices something else.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{theres something strange about this shot.}
<A>__{she takes the remote from ryuji, rewinds it a ways. onscreen, the woman begins coming her long hair again.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{from this angle, the mirror should be reflecting whoevers filming.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{so, what does that mean?}
<A>__{asakawa lets out a short sigh.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{well, if the person who made this is a pro, thered be a way around that, i guess, but still...}
<A>__{the screen changes, showing the mass of squiggling kanji characters again.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{volcanic eruption... eruption where?}
<A>__{he pauses the screen, trying to make sense of what is written.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{this is gonna be impossible to figure out on just a regular tv screen, dont you think?}
<A>__{they are both still staring at the screen when from behind them comes the sound of someone opening the front door. ryuji turns off the tv, ejects the tape from the deck.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{come on in.}
<A>__{asakawa flashes a look at ryuji and then turns her head back towards the front door to see who has entered. a cute, nervous looking young girl with short hair approaches slowly. she is carrying a plastic bag filled with groceries.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{asakawa, meet my student, takano mai.}
<A>__{he turns, addresses mai.}
<C>__{ryuji }
<D>__{this is asakawa, my ex wife.}
<A>__{ryuji gets up and walks conveniently away.}
<C>__{mai}
<D>__{nice to meet you. im takano.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{asakawa.}
<A>__{> as you may already be aware, japanese name order is the >opposite of englishs, and even close friends may continue to >address one another by their last names. incidentally, asakawas >first name is reiko. in this scene, mai deferentially refers >to ryuji as sensei, meaning teacher. mai sets the bag of groceries down and chases after ryuji. he is putting on his jacket and getting ready to leave.}
<C>__{mai}
<D>__{sensei, the people from the publishing company called about the deadline on your thesis again.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<P>__{(brusquely)}
<D>__{whatre they talkin to you about it for?}
<C>__{mai}
<D>__{because they can never get a hold of you.}
<A>__{ryuji picks up his keys, video firmly in hand.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{ask them to wait another week.}
<C>__{mai}
<D>__{sensei, ask them yourself, please.}
<A>__{ryuji is already headed for the door. his back is to her as he responds.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{ok, ok.}
<A>__{asakawa walks after him. they leave. mai pouts unhappily a bit, and then breaks into a smile as an idea crosses her mind. she walks across the room to where ryuji has set up a large blackboard filled with mathematical equations. grinning, mai rubs out part of one equation with her sleeve and writes in a new value.}
