<L>__{interior bedroom level, karenin house day}
<A>__{karenin approaches the bedroom door.}
<P>__{anna (o.c.)}
<D>__{no i don't want to see him.}
<P>__{betsy (o.c.)}
<D>__{. . . but your husband surely wouldn't . . .}
<L>__{interior bedroom, karenin house, same time day}
<A>__{anna sees karenin who is about to retreat.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{please excuse me.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no stay.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i am so glad to see you. everyone asks after you.}
<A>__{karenin bows to her and kisses anna's hand.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{you look feverish.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{we have been talking too much so i'm going.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{princess betsy came to tell me . . . i don't want to hide anything from you . . . count vronsky asked to come to say goodbye he's going away. i have said i can't receive him.}
<A>__{betsy kisses anna.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{goodbye, my treasure.}
<A>__{karenin follows betsy out. anna gives in to a moment of grief, and recovers herself when she hears the crack of karenin's knuckles. he comes in.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{i agree with you. as he is going away, there is no need for count vronsky to come here.}
<C>__{anna}
<A>__{i have just said so, so there's no need to repeat it.}
<C>__{karenin}
<A>__{but it is for you to decide.}
<C>__{anna}
<A>__{yes, and i decided.}
<C>__{karenin}
<A>__{then i am very glad that }
<C>__{anna}
<A>__{that we agree, so perhaps we can stop talk ing about it.}
<C>__{karenin}
<A>__{of course. is there anything i can do for you?}
<C>__{anna}
<A>__{yes, can you please please please stop crack ing your knuckles.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<A>__{i'm a bad woman. but i can't breathe. your kindness which i can't repay, and your}
<D>__{forgiveness }
<C>__{karenin}
<A>__{you begged me for my forgiveness.}
<C>__{anna}
<A>__{but i didn't die and now i have to live with it! if only you would have gone on hating me.}
<C>__{karenin}
<A>__{but then what? what? what do you want? do you know what you want? do you want to see count vronsky?}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<A>__{not to say goodbye.}
<C>__{karenin}
<A>__{i can't hear.}
<C>__{anna}
<A>__{not to say goodbye.}
<C>__{karenin}
<P>__{(pause)}
<A>__{you would be lost. irretrievably lost. you would have no position. and worse if we divorce. you would be the guilty party. that means you cannot legally remarry. your union with count vronsky would be illegitimate, and so would your daughter who now has the protection of my name. and that is what you want! it would be a sin to help you destroy yourself.}
<C>__{anna}
<A>__{you forget something. count vronsky and i love each other.}
<C>__{karenin}
<A>__{and this love sanctifies a criminal folly?}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(cries out)}
<D>__{all i know is that i sent him away and it's as if i'd shot myself through the heart!}
<C>__{karenin}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i see. and serozha . . . ?}
<A>__{it's the crux for anna, and she is prepared for it.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i would die for him, but i won't live like this for him. when he knows about love, he'll forgive me.}
<A>__{karenin can see where this takes him.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{then i must choose the smaller sin. vronsky robbed me of my cloak and i will give him my coat. i will give you grounds to divorce me, and i will accept the scandal, the humilia tion and the consequences to my career.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no . . . i can't . . .}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{you may write to him but i would prefer you not to see him until you have left this house.}
