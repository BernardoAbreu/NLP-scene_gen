<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior club night}
<A>__{we keep the sound of catch's trumpet going as he and sharon exit the club and begin to stroll away, arms around each other. in a moment, he stops. he can't go another step. he has to kiss her. he holds her face and comes in for the kiss, and above the music we hear her say softly.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{where i've never been kissed.}
<A>__{he stops and stares a moment, then takes her hand and walks her out into the middle of the traffic less boulevard and there, in the center of the street, kisses her, and she responds, and it is their finest, fullest moment, lifting on the music, and it is ironic and prophetic that at its peak they are washed over by the revolving light from a police car and a siren that chirps once as they break, staring.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{oh, god.}
<A>__{we widen to see ray and sanchez in their police unit 20 feet away. ray uses a small electronic bullhorn to say...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{are you in danger there?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{go away.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i was talking to him, pogo.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{no thanks, ray. everything's code four. go away.}
<A>__{sharon laughs aloud and walks (with catch in hand) to the police car, her joy overwhelming any embarrassment. she gestures behind them at the jazz club.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{see that place? he's going to be playing there every weekend.}
<A>__{catch notes the pride with which she says this.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(impressed; to catch)}
<D>__{oh, yeah? what d'you play?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{it's music, ray. you wouldn't like it.}
<A>__{she waves and walks off with catch, arms around each other. the cops watch them go.}
