<A>__{concealed in the shadows, harry is shucking out of his drysuit. underneath is he is wearing black tux pants, suspenders, cummerbund and a formal shirt. he puts a tiny plug, like a hearing aid, deep in his ear canal. a sub vocal transceiver. very advanced.}

<D>__{switching to sub vocal. gib, you copy?}
<C>__{gib }
<D>__{it's talkradio. you're on the air.}
<A>__{harry slips into his shoulder harness... holster on one side, containing his .45 auto glock 22, and the transmitter pack for the ear piece slung on the other. he slips on a formal jacket, concealing the rig. then a final touch. a little aftershave from a tiny plastic vial. harry adjusts his bow tie and strides confidently out of the shadows, crossing quickly to the main house. he looks ultrasharp in his black tux with the white silk cummerbund and his hair slicked back. he enters the main house through a back service entrance.}
