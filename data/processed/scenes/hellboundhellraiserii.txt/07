<A>__{the black screen continues and, rising slowly from it and falling back slowly into it, in a dream like, surrealistic manner, come various images of the officer's torment pleasure in hell. by various camera tricks, such as step printing or optical blurring, his face is still not clearly seen, but is seen enough for us to see his sensual, almost orgasmic responses to what is being done to him. cuts appear spontaneously across his face, leaving a grid like crisscross pattern of wounds. finally, a disembodied hand gripping a hammer drives nails into each corner formed by these wounds and, as the face comes into full view for the first time, we realize who this is. it is pinhead from hellraiser. pinhead's completed face floats on the blackness and stares out at us.}
