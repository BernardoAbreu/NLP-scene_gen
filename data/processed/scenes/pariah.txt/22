<L>__{interior hospital break room continuous}
<A>__{audrey whisks her lunch bag out of the fridge and heads toward a table. a few lounging aides wad up their garbage and flee the break room. audrey settles down at the table and pulls a fashion magazine from her work tote, pretending not to be hurt. she peels open a cup of vanilla yogurt and begins reading. a big red department store bag sits next to her work tote. the television suspended over the table mumbles corporate healthcare infomercials. mrs. singletary, one of audrey's co workers swoops in and plops a plastic grocery bag on the table across from her.}

<D>__{none of yo' damn business!!}
<A>__{the co workers hoot in unison and descend upon the various parts of the breakroom. audrey shoves the sweater back in the bag and nestles it between her feet. somebody cranks on a small radio and a frisky r&b beat invades the air. mrs. singletary pats audrey on the arm.}

<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{oh i will. i will call you when rowdy co worker #3 hey bren' this is what i was telling you about!!}

<D>__{is that her?! rowdy co worker #3 told you! rowdy co worker #2 look how big she done got!}
<A>__{the center of the room shifts and audrey is once again alone at the fringes. she collects her shopping bag and looks around to say goodbye, but no one notices her leave.}
