<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{due to the lack of hard evidence......}
<A>__{the three burst in, guns drawn, and are walking down the aisle.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{all media to the back! drop the cameras! drop 'em!}
<A>__{terrified, they all obey. connor and murphy pull yakavetta from the witness booth by his hair and place him on his knees just before the judge's bench. they face him toward the occupants of the courtroom. the father walks up and motions for the judge, who is now banging his gavel and shouting in protest, to come off the stand. as soon as he is within arms reach, dad takes him by the collar and drags him down the aisle all the way to where the media stands in horror. he turns and walks back down the aisle.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{you people have been chosen to reveal our existence to the world. you will witness what happens here today and you will tell of it afterwards.}
<A>__{all eyes to the front.}
<C>__{yakavetta}
<P>__{(looking to his comrades)}
<D>__{fuckin' do something!}
<A>__{the father keeps them covered. he passes the front, he looks and sees a virginal looking woman with her head down crying into her hands. she is on the left side. he gently tilts her chin forward, her eyes fixated on a faded blue butterfly on the back of his hand.}
<C>__{father }
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{you must watch dear. it'll all be over soon.}
<P>__{(she obeys)}
<A>__{the father takes out a flask. he pours the booze on the judges bench and set it ablaze. fire alarms start to sound. connor and murphy jump up on the lawyers' tables. murphy on the prosecution side, connor on the defense. the father has his sawed off to the back of yakavetta's head.}
<C>__{connor}
<P>__{(yelling over the alarm)}
<D>__{now, you will receive us.}
<C>__{murphy}
<P>__{(yelling over the alarm)}
<D>__{we do not ask for your poor or your hungry.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{we do not want your tired and sick.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{it is your corrupt we claim.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{it is your evil, who will be sought by us.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{with every breath we shall hunt them down.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. these are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{these are not polite suggestions. they are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.}
<P>__{(points to yakavetta)}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{there are varying degrees of evil. we urge you lesser forms of filth}
<P>__{(pointing to yakavetta's people)}
<D>__{not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{for if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. and on that day you will reap it.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{and we will send you to whatever god you wish.}
<A>__{connor and murphy jump off the table. they approach yakavetta and stand on either side of their father. all three men hold guns to his head and recite the prayer. as they speak, the right side of the courtroom screams in protest. the left watches in wide eyed terror, although some men encourage them to do it. the macmanus' read the prayer. they do not falter as the flames rage behind them. yakavetta, accepting his fate, closing his eyes. peacefully, he does the sign of the cross. the all fire at once. the room explodes in confusion. the three exit the back.}
