<A>__{reggie as she looks down into the camera. she closes her eyes for a moment, then looks again.}
<C>__{grandpierre's voice }
<D>__{well, madame ?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{grandpierre's voice }
<D>__{you are positive?}
<A>__{she nods again. grandpierre moves into the shot.}
<C>__{grandpierre}
<D>__{you loved him?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{i'm very cold.}
<A>__{grandpierre nods as he turns to the unseen attendant. camera suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the wall. blackness comes with a loud clang and continues while the echo dies.}
