<L>__{interior john's mobile home night}
<A>__{full meeting of the writing group, all crammed around the dining table. henry and hannah sit apart. a single bowl of pretzels has been placed before them. hannah reads from her typed pages. alan, william, colette, and henry hang on her every word. john is half listening at best, more interested in the magazine he's thumbing through. william reaches under the table and gently squeezes colette's hand. surprised, she pulls her hand away.}

<P>__{(reading; with feeling)}
<D>__{"please come home, michael." "why would you want to marry me, kyra? i barely graduated high school." "michael, i don't care about some silly college degree. you're the most intelligent person i've ever known. you are my shining star."}
<A>__{then colette puts it back and squeezes william's hand. it's his turn to be surprised. hannah slides off her new reading glasses, waiting for someone to react. the room falls silent. alan steps in.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{ok. comments. anyone?}
<A>__{no response. group members look at the pages. at each other. no one steps forward.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{i value your feedback. we're all in this together, right?}
<A>__{nobody bites.}
<C>__{hannah }
<D>__{colette did the new scene work for you?}
<A>__{colette seems thrown by the direct question.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{oh...gee...hannah. what? i mean, you're being published. this is being published.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{but my editor wants rewrites. am i on track?}
<A>__{colette punts. alan jumps in to save his wife.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{of course you are, hannah.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{you got the deal. you got the check. first one to be published.}
<A>__{john clears his throat rather loudly: what about me, butthead? william ignores him.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i think what i'm hearing from the group is...is...you're fine. we all love it. nothing here to critique. you don't need us well, it's not that you don't need us, but, you know...}
<A>__{alan's voice trails off before he can dig himself any deeper. more silence as hannah wrestles with this unexpected reaction. finally looks to henry for help.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{what do you think, henry?}
<A>__{all eyes on henry. he hesitates. then }
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{yes. actually, it is really good, but there are a couple things little things i'd point out. for example }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{holy douglas macarthur }
<A>__{all eyes on john. finally holds up magazine to reveal that he's been reading variety.}
<C>__{john }
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"hollywood decides to go sleeping on the moon.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{first time scribe hannah rinaldi, repped by brian barkley of soho, scores six figure movie deal. ink is still fresh, but barkley boasts keen interest by..."}
<A>__{john keeps reading. various reactions, mostly muted, around the table. can hannah's face turn any redder?}
