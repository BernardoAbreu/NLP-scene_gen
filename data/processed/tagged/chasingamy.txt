<L>__{interior comic book store day}
<A>__{a pile of comic books are on a shelf next to myriad others. the most prominent one is called bluntman and chronic'. a hand reaches in and pulls one out of frame. holden opens the comic and flips through it he shakes his head. banky looks over his shoulder.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{felt like this fucking day would never come. issue two on the shelf.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{yippee.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{don't start, alright! this is a cool moment, and i'd appreciate you not trying to ruin it. how often does a guy get the opportunity to purchase something with his name on it!}
<P>__{(points to name on cover)}
<D>__{banky edwards right!}
<P>__{(points to the other)}
<D>__{holden mcneil.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i know my name.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{c'mon, sour puss. we got the rest of our lives to be artists. but it's supply and demand. and right now, the unwashed masses demand this.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(off comic)}
<D>__{this is easy, alright! and right now it pays the bills. just don't forget that we're better than this.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{i will tell you who we're better than: these two fags right here.}
<A>__{they approach the counter, where steve dave, the store manager, and walt the fan boy, play a card game.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(lays books on the counter)}
<D>__{alright old maid's take a break from the crazy 8's marathon and ring us up. steve dave}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{well, well,well, walt did you see who it is! the local celebrities. quick get them to autograph one of their books so we can sell it for triple it's value.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{i'm not that in need of fifteen cents right now.}
<A>__{they snicker and high five one another. holden rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{you guys operate the smallest, ladies' bridge circle i've ever seen.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{for your information, we're playing crimson mystical mages' an overpower card game. not that either of you would give a shit about something as advanced as this there are no dick or poopie jokes involved.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(to holden)}
<D>__{i don't think they're fans.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{no, we're not. you're both a couple of fucking no talents that got lucky. steve dave and obviously your handlers or hangers on convinced you that your first comic was good which it was not it was thoroughly mediocre with a few spiky bits of dialogue. and when you get your foot in the door of the business, what do you do! you turn out a piece of shit like bluntman and chronic'.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{tell him, steve dave. steve dave}
<P>__{(off comic)}
<D>__{bluntman and chronic'. pah. what was that thing the little stoner pulled on the villain in the last issue!}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{the stinky palm. steve dave stinky palm. you give comics a bad name i tell all my customers not to buy it, to spend their money on a real comic book.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{fucking one hit wonder, dime store frank miller's. steve dave this is the reality at comic toast you're not going to get your ass kissed here, because both me and walt think you suck.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{and me. steve dave i said that.}
<A>__{steve dave offers the boys his two middle fingers, then goes back to playing his game with walt. holden and banky stare, shocked. banky nudges holden and they both exit steve dave and the fan boy slap hands and go back to playing.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{i've got a dragon card forty power ups and twelve life points! ha! i get your elf card! steve dave you're such a bitch! but thankfully, i've saved a dark forces shaman card for just such an occasion.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{you suck! eighty six life power points to my twenty two! steve dave i schooled their asses, now i'm schooling your's.}
<A>__{suddenly. a trash can crashes through the front window. steve dave and walt hit the deck like bitches, covering one another. they look up slowly. steve dave leaps to his feet and looks at the shattered mess. he pulls something off the garbage can and reads it.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{you know it was those two fucks! let's call the cops and have them busted! i know where their studio is! or better yet, let's sue! you can sue them, steve dave! steve dave}
<P>__{(still reading note)}
<D>__{that won't be necessary.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{what?! why the hell not! steve dave}
<P>__{(holds up check)}
<D>__{because this is a check for three times what that window cost.}
<P>__{(reading note)}
<D>__{dear critics thanks for the insight. but like my grandmother always said fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.. and break their window.' kiss it, banky the hack. p.s. your card game blows.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{he said kiss it!}

<C>__{fan}
<D>__{could you sign it to a really big fan!}
<A>__{holden sits at a table. across from the barely managing to stand fan. he offers him a patronizingly kind, half smile in return,}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you bet.}
<A>__{we're at a comic book show, specifically at a book signing. behind holden hangs a large banner, heralding holden mcneil and banky edwards creators of bluntman and chronic'. beside it is a large mock up of the comic book cover which features two stoner super heroes who bear a striking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly neighborhood drug dealers, holden hands the book back to the fan.}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{i love this book man! this shit's awesome. i wish i was like these guys getting stoned, talking all raw about chicks and fighting supervillains! i love these guys! they're like cheech and chong' meet bill and fed'!}

<P>__{(signing the comic)}
<D>__{i ink it and i'm also the colorist. the guy next to me draws it. but we both came up with the characters,}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{what's that mean you ink it'!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{well. it means that holden draws the pictures in pencil, and then he gives it to me to go over in ink}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{so you just trace!}
<A>__{banky freezes up. he composes himself and continues signing.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{it's not tracing. i add depth and shading to give the image mere definition. only then does the drawing really take shape.}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{you go over what he draws with a pen that's tracing.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(hands book back to collector)}
<D>__{not really.}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{next!}
<A>__{a little kid steps up but the collector lingers.}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{hey man. if somebody draws something and then you draw the same thing right on top of it, not going out side the designated original art what do call that!}
<C>__{little kid}
<P>__{(shrugs)}

<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(grabbing little kid's book)}
<D>__{how should i sign this?}
<C>__{little kid}
<P>__{(grabs book back)}
<D>__{i don't want you to sign it, i want the guy that draws bluntman and chronic to sign it. you're just a tracer.}

<A>__{holden accepts a comic from another fan.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(off comic)}
<D>__{who do i sign it to!}
<A>__{before holden can finish, a loud crash is heard. he looks to his left and freaks. banky is throttling the collector from across the table. the collector attempts to fight him off. security guards pull them apart. holden grabs banky.}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{jesus! all i did was call him a tracer!}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(to collector)}

<C>__{holden}

<C>__{banky}
<D>__{he started it! fucking cock knocker! he's lucky i didn't put my pen through his thorax!}

<L>__{interior comic book convention lecture hall day}
<A>__{hooper fills the frame. he comes off like a typical, pro black anti white homeboy.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{for years in this industry whenever an african american character hero or villain was introduced usually by white artists and writers they got slapped with racist names that singled them out as negroes: black panther, black lightning, black goliath, black mantra, black talon, black spider, black hand, black falcon, black cat..}
<C>__{voice from crowd}
<D>__{she's white.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{she is?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well bust this regardless.}
<A>__{we're at a panel discussion. the room is full. five creators sit at a long table, their names on placards in front of them. (one of them is a very striking girl.) the banner behind them reads words up minority voices in comics'.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(holds up comic)}
<D>__{now my book, white hating coon', doesn't have any of that bullshit. the hero's name is maleekwa, and he's a descendant of the black tribe that established the first society on the planet, while all you european mother fuckers were still hiding in caves and shit, all terrified of the sun. he's a strong role model that a young black reader can look up to, cause i'm here to tell you the chickens are comin' home to roost, ya'll: the black man's no longer gonna play the minstrel in the medium of comics and sci fi fantasy! we're keeping it real, and we're gonna get respect by any means necessary!}
<A>__{during the speech, holden and banky enter and sit up front.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{bullshit! lando calrissian was a black man, and he got to fly the millennium falcon!}
<A>__{hooper whips his head around, looking for the source of the comment}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{who said that?!?}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{i did! lando calrissian is a positive black role model in the realm of science fiction fantasy.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{fuck lando calrissian! uncle tom nigger! always some white boy gotta invoke the holy trilogy'! bust this those movies are about how the white man keeps the brother man down even in a galaxy far, far away. check this shit. you got cracker farm boy luke skywalker, nazi poster boy blond hair, blue eyes. and then you've got darth vader: the blackest brother in the galaxy. nubian god.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{what's a nubian?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{shut the fuck up! now vader, he's a spiritual brother, with the force and all that shit. then this cracker skywalker gets his hands on a light saber, and the boy decides he's gonna run the fucking universe gets a whole klan of whites together, and they're gonna bust up vader's hood the death star. now what the fuck do you call that!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{intergalactic civil war!}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{gentrification. they're gonna drive our the black element, to make the galaxy quote, unquote safe' for white folks.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{but vader turns, out to be luke's father. and in jedi, they become friends.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{don't make me bust a cap in your ass, yo! jedi's the most insulting installment, because vader's beautiful, black visage is sullied when he pulls off his mask to reveal a feeble, crusty white man! they're trying to tell us that deep inside, we all want to be white!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{well isn't that true!}
<A>__{hooper explodes, he pulls a nine millimeter from his belt, draws on banky and fires. banky goes down, falling forward into the crowd the crowd screams and starts to scatter, hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists in the air.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{black rage! black rage!! i will kill any white folks i lay my mother fuckin' eyes on!!!}
<A>__{the crowd is gone. holden sits in his chair, laughing. hooper steps off the stage and picks banky's head up off the floor.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(breaking character)}
<D>__{what's a nubian!' bitch, you almost made me laugh!}
<A>__{hooper sounds different actually, he sounds gay. actually he is. banky smiles.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{well what about you! you didn't tell me you were going to scream black rage'. i nearly pissed myself.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{how do you manage to get away with this all the time? shouldn't cops be busting your head open right about now?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{wrong coast.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(off gun)}
<D>__{well this right here she full of blanks, okay. and opiate gets all sorts of legal clearances before i go on.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{your publisher condones these theatrics!}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{condones? honey, they insist. i need to sell the image to sell the book would the audience still buy the black rage' angle if they found out the book was written by a.. a...}
<C>__{banky}

<D>__{when you say if it sounds so sexy...}
<P>__{(he kisses banky full on the lips)}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(wipes his lips)}
<D>__{hey, hey! i will play your victim, but not your catcher.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{how is it that you sound like minister farakhan when you're on stage..}
<A>__{they turn to see... a beautiful, blonde, ruffled haired angel swinging her purse in a circle. her name is alyssa. she's the striking girl from the panel who didn't get to say much.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{...and the king of pop when you're nor.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{look out, boys this kitten has a whip.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(shoves and slaps him)}
<D>__{always before i get to speak! i swear the next con i attend and they ask me to be on the minority panel, if i see your name anywhere near the list, i'm passing.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(defending himself)}
<D>__{holden. banky this pile of p.m.s. is alyssa jones. she does that book idiosyncratic routine'. this is the fourth panel we've been on together, and even though she knows my publisher sets this up and pays for the event. she still gets mad when it ends with my act.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i just wish i was the one who gets to shoot you.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{that's what my father said when i came nay leapt out of the closet}
<P>__{(off guys)}
<D>__{these boys do bluntman and chronic', which outsells both of our books put together, hence they're never on a panel with the likes of us. they slumming right now.}
<C>__{banky}

<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{hey, jealousy.}
<P>__{(to the boys)}
<D>__{i told alyssa i'd buy her a post rave drink. do the garden staters have to sprint to the lincoln tunnel, or can you stay for a round in the big, scary city!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{we're gonna take off soon...}

<C>__{holden}
<D>__{he's got a pointerior archie never did settle on betty or veronica.}

<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{nope. i'm happy my stuff gets read at all. there's very little market for hearts and flowers in this spandex clad, big pecs, big tits, big guns field. if i sell two issues, i feel like john grisham.}

<C>__{holden}
<D>__{that is love.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{not nearly finished. two months before she's going to graduate, he's got this job digging graves, and he comes across...}

<C>__{holden}
<D>__{clever.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{so now he owns the plot and all of its contents. two days later, my mother's uncle is worth three million.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{at which time he marries the high school sweetheart and lives happily ever after.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{not even close. inside the steamer trunk, stenciled into the wood, or something like that, is a curse.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{someone wrote 'fuck' inside his new steamer trunk.}

<C>__{holden}
<D>__{what kind of asshole writes that inside a steamer trunk!}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{the same kind of asshole that buries silver ingots. the day my mother's uncle is heading out to see the girl, he stops at his accountant's to grab some cash, and winds up missing his train. so he has to take the next one which he does and he gets there an hour later than his usual time of arrival, whereupon he sees lights.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{a hero's welcome for the new millionaire.}

<D>__{isn't that the standard definition?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{again with the standards. i think virginity is lost when you make love for the first time.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{with a member of the opposite sex.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{why? why only then?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{because that's the standard.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{so if a virgin is raped, then she's still a virgin?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{of course not.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{but rape is not the standard. so she's had sex, but not the standard idea of sex. hence, according to your definition, she'd still be a virgin.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{okay, i will revise. virginity is lost when the hymen is broken.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{then i lost my virginity at ten, because i fell on a fence post when i was ten, and it broke my hymen. now i have to tell people that i lost it to a wooden post i'd known my whole young life?}

<C>__{holden}
<D>__{emotional?}

<D>__{well, i fell in love hard with caitlin bree when we were in high school.}

<C>__{alyssa}

<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you think your upbringing had something to do with your lifestyle choice?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{somewhere along the line. it's a gradual transition to make from doing what the majority does to taking a leap of faith and doing what feels more natural. everything helps from the way you were handled as a kid, to the way the boys acted in third grade, to the shoes you wore at your freshman prom.}

<L>__{3) in the studio, holden displays some of his artwork to}

<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(inserts coin and pulls lever)}
<D>__{the premise is very basic you roll the ball up the ramp at varying speeds, in an effort to pop it into the score circles. the higher the score, the more prize tickets you get.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{what do you do with the prize tickets?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{trade them in for prizes that aren't worth nearly as much as you paid to play the game.}

<D>__{then what's the point?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{it's fun.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{and you question my lifestyle.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{observe.}
<A>__{holden rolls the ball. it pops into a twenty point circle.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{see? it's just that simple.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{why not just walk up there and put it in the fifty every time?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{where's the skill in that?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{oh, this is a skill? i'm sorry, i had no idea.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{just toss one.}
<A>__{alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and whips it overhand. it pops off one of the circles and shoots back at them, missing them as they duck. an oc knock and an "ow!" is heard. holden reacts as alyssa laughs.}

<D>__{he just feels left out, i think.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i'm not talking about his infantile hang up with me. i'm talking about when you two were playing that game. everytime he swore when his players messed up, he called them cocksuckers, he referred to the players as queers, he called you a cock teaser...}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i thought he was talking to you.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i know you think it means nothing, and it may in fact be unintentional, but it's ugly all the same.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{he was just pissed he was losing.}

<D>__{so he slams the gay community?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{c'mon. don't get all p.c. on me.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i'm not. but what is that saying?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{it says he gets too easily frustrated.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{it's passive agressive gay bashing.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{how do you figure?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{how casually did it roll off his tongue? and that's how he expresses his anger? by calling people faggots?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i think you're reading too much into it.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i think you're just so used to it that it rolls off your back. i've heard the two of you play your little rank out game where one insists the other is gay.}
<P>__{(as the boys)}
<D>__{"you're a faggot. no, you're a faggot." it's cute and all to watch you go at it like grade schooler, but it's also offensive labeling and ducking the label of being gay as if it were the scarlet fucking letter.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you're blowing this way out of proportion. we live in a more tolerant age now. you refer to yourself as a dyke. hooper calls himself a faggot all the time...}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{yeah, but that's what's known as empowerment disempowerment. i call myself a dyke so it's not too devastating when some throwback screams it at me as i'm leaving a bar at night. same for hooper by calling himself a faggot, he steals the thunder away from the mouthy jerks of this world who'd like to beat him to it. but the difference between us having it and your friend saying it is miles wide. we say it to mask the pain you say it for lack of a better expression at any given moment. no holden, we do not live in a more tolerant age. and if you think that's the case, then you've been in the suburbs way too long to be resuscitated.}
<A>__{holden kind of sulks. alyssa notices.}

<P>__{(gets up)}
<D>__{and don't call her a dyke, alright? she's a lesbian.}

<C>__{holden}
<D>__{it's passive aggressive gay bashing; and i know you're not really prejudiced at heart. you should just find some other way to express your anger, is all i'm saying.}

<D>__{bear with me here. i just want to put you through this little exercise.}

<D>__{so? people change.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{oh, it's that simple? you fall in love with me and want a romantic relationship, nothing changes for you with the exception of feeling hunky dorey all the time. but what about me? it's not that simple, is it? i can't just get into a relationship with you without throwing my whole fucking world into upheaval!}

<D>__{there's no 'we' here. you're going to have to go through this alone. and it's one thing to read about shit, and something different when you're forced to deal with it on a regular basis. when you guys are walking in the mall and both your heads turn at a really nice looking chick, it's going to eat you up inside. you'll spend most of your time wondering when the other shoe's going to drop. because for you, this isn't about cool weird sex stuff, it's about love.}

<D>__{i've given that a lot of thought, you know? i mean, now that i'm being ostracized by my friends, i've had a lot of time to think about all of this. and what i've come up with is really simple: i came to this on my terms. i didn't just heed what i was taught, you know? men and women should be together, it's the natural way that kind of thing. i'm not with you because of what family, society, life tried to instill in me from day one. the way the world is how seldom you meet that one person who gets you... it's so rare. my parents didn't really have it. there was no example set for me in the world of male female relation ships. and to cut oneself off from finding that person to immediately half your options by eliminating the possibility of finding that one person within your own gender... that just seemed stupid. so i didn't. and by leaving my options open, i was branded 'gay', which to me was no big deal labels are labels, you know? they define what you do, not who you are, i guess. but then you come along. you the one least likely; i mean, you were a guy.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{still am.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{and while i was falling for you, i put a ceiling on that, because you were a guy. until i remembered why i opened the door to women in the first place to not limit the likelihood of finding that one person who'd compliment me so completely. and so here we are, i was thorough when i looked for you, and i feel justified lying in your arms because i got here on my terms, and have no question that there was someplace i didn't look. and that makes all the difference.}

<L>__{4) holden carries alyssa on his shoulders through the}

<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{yes holden! in fact, everything you heard or dug up on me was probably true! yeah, i took on two guys at once! you want to hear some gems you might not have unearthed i took a twenty six year old guy to my senior prom, and then left halfway through to have sex with him and gwen turner in the back of a limo! and the girl who got caught in the shower with miss moffit, the gym teacher? that was me! or how about in college, when i let shannon hamilton videotape us having sex only to find out the next day that he broadcast it on the campus cable station?! they're all true those and so many more! didn't you know? i'm the queen of urban legend!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{how the hell could you do those things?!}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{easily! some of it i did out of stupidity, some of it i did out of what i thought was love, but good or bad they were my choices, and i'm not making apologies for them now not to you or anyone! and how dare you try to lay a guilt trip on me about it in public, no less! who the fuck do you think you are, you judgemental prick?!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{how am i supposed to feel about all of this?}

<D>__{there's a world of fucking difference between typical high school sex and two guys at once! they fucking used you?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i used them! you don't think i would've let it happen if i hadn't wanted it to, do you?! i was an experimental girl, for christ's sake! maybe you knew early on that your track was from point 'a' to 'b' but unlike you i wasn't given a fucking map at birth, so i tried it all! that is until we that's you and i got together, and suddenly, i was sated. can't you take some fucking comfort in that? you turned out to be all i was ever looking for the missing piece in the big fucking puzzle!}
<P>__{(tries to calm down)}
<D>__{look i'm sorry i let you believe that you were the only guy i'd ever been with. i should've been more honest. but it seemed to make you feel special in a way that me telling you over and over again how incredible you are would never get across.}

<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{do you mean to tell me that while you have zero problem with me sleeping with half the women in new york city you have some sort of half assed, mealy mouthed objection to pubescent antics, that took place almost ten years ago? what the fuck is your problem?!?}

<C>__{holden}
<D>__{please. i have to get through this.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and with you banky i know why you're having such a hard time with alyssa, and it's something that's been obvious forever, but i guess i just didn't acknowledge it.}
<P>__{(takes a deep breath)}
<D>__{you're in love with me.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(makes a face; beat)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you're attracted to me. just as, in a way, i'm attracted to you. i mean, it makes sense we've been together so long, we have so much in common...}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{well, i've got to get home and catch the last few minutes of 'babylon 5', so i will be...}
<A>__{holden grabs him, kisses him full on the lips, and pushes him back onto the couch alyssa reacts. banky wide eyed and speechless looks away.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{it's something you're going to have to deal with. bank. you may very well be gay, which explains your homophobia and why you're so jealous of alyssa, and your sense of humor as well.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{just 'cause a guy's got a predilection coward dick jokes...}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{bank. stop. deal with it. you'll feel much better.}
<A>__{he grabs a chair from the side of the room.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{now at this point, you may be asking yourself the question that i've been going over and over in my head for the last few days: what does one have to do with the other?}
<A>__{alyssa's face drops. she subtly shakes her head.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{don't.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{and when i did some serious soul searching, it came at me from out of nowhere, and suddenly it all made sense a calm came over me. i know what we have to do. and then you bank, you alyssa, and i all of us... can finally be... alright.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(again, under her breath)}
<D>__{please don't say it.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(sits in the chair; takes a long beat)}
<D>__{we've all got to have sex together.}
<A>__{the room is silent. holden lights a cigarette. banky's eyes nearly bug. alyssa's head drops.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{don't you see? that would take care of everything. alyssa i wouldn't feel inadequate or too conservative anymore. i will have done something on par with all the experience you've had. and it'll be with you, which'll make it that much more powerful. and banky you can cake that leap that everyone else but you sees that you should take. and it'll be okay, because it'll be with me your best friend for years. we've been everything to each other but intimates. and now, we'll have been through that together too. and it won't have to be a total leap for you, because a woman will be involved. and when it's over, all that aggression you feel toward alyssa will be gone. because you'll have shared in something beautiful with the woman i love. it'll be cathartic. a true communion. we have to do this. for me, for both of you... for all of our sakes. this will keep us together.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what do you say?}
<A>__{banky stares forward, wide eyed. he leans back into the couch and lets out a huge sigh. then shrugs.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{holden smiles at his friend. then he looks at alyssa.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you know i need this. you know it'll help.}
<A>__{alyssa looks at him, sadly.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{holden reacts, shocked banky lets out a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{no? i... i thought you'd be into this.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{you did? what does that say about me?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{but you've... you've done... stuff... like this. this should be no big deal for you.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{you don't want this.}
<P>__{(lights her cigarette)}
<D>__{you really don't want this. trust me.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i need this. this has to happen. why can't you see that? and how can you not? what does that say about me? you can take it from two guys whose names you can barely remember, but i ask you to share an experience like it where it's about intimacy and you say no?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(inhales from her cigarette, takes a beat)}
<D>__{i can't.}
<A>__{holden moves to her side of the couch.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you can. i will be there. and when it's over, we'll be the strongest we've ever been because we got through some nasty shit together. and we'll finally be on the same level together. and then there'll be nothing we can't accomplish.}
<A>__{a tear rolls down her cheek she looks at him, sadly, and touches his face.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{oh holden.}
<P>__{(trying to compose herself)}
<D>__{that time is over for me. i've been there. i've done it. and i didn't find what i was looking for in any of it. i found that in you in us. doing this won't help you forget about the things you're hung up on. it'll create more.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{no it won't. i thought about all of that.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{no, it will. maybe you'll see me differently from then on maybe you'll despise me for going along with it, once you're in the moment. maybe i will moan differently and then you'll resent banky, and become suspicious of us. or you'll alienate him because of it, and then grow to blame and hate me for the deterioration of your friendship. or what if i sincerely doubt it, but what if i saw something in banky that i never saw before, and fell in love with him and left you. i've been down roads like this before; many times. i know you feel doing this will broaden your horizons and give you experience. but i've had those experiences on my own. i can't accompany you on your's. i'm past that now.}
<P>__{(touches his face; stares to cry)}
<D>__{or maybe i just love you too much. and i feel hurt and let down that you'd want to share me with anyone. because i never wanted to share you}
<P>__{(holds it in; gets up)}
<D>__{regardless i can't be a part of this.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{or you. not anymore}
<P>__{(hugs him)}
<D>__{i love you. i always will. know that.}
<A>__{she releases him, then slaps him.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{but i'm not your fucking whore.}
<A>__{alyssa storms away, stopping briefly to look banky up and down.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{he's your's again.}
<A>__{she walks our of the studio. the door closes behind her. banky and holden stand there, silently. cut to black.}
<L>__{int comic book show day}
<A>__{it's one year later. we're at another show, not unlike the one from the opening. a copy of 'bluntman and chronic' enters the frame. the cover reads 'the death chronic', complete with a corresponding drawing.}
<C>__{banky v.o.}
<D>__{blast from the past.}
<A>__{banky sits at his own signing table. behind him hangs a banner that reads 'banky edwards creator of baby dave'. a small line is formed in front of him. he talks with a}
<B>__{fan.}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{do you know how much it's going for these days? one ten. you signing it will push that up even higher,}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{if you sell it, i want a kickback}
<P>__{(starts signing)}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{i don't know if this is true, but i heard once that there was going to be an animated series.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{there was going to be}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{what happened!}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(off comic)}
<D>__{you're looking at it. no chronic no cartoon}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{that sucks man. that would've been awesome.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{tell me about it}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{is that what happened to you and holden mcneil? you got into a fight over the rights or something?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{it was a little more involved than that.}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{whatever happened to him?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{he quit the biz. i guess.}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{you guys don't talk anymore?}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(looks oc)}
<D>__{no. not really.}
<A>__{banky locks eyes with someone oc. his expression softens. holden leans against a wall on the far side of the room. he smiles at banky. banky smiles back, and sort of nods. holden holds up a copy of banky's new solo comic. he points to it and gives a thumbs up.}
<C>__{oc fan}
<D>__{probably shouldn't have killed off chronic.}
<A>__{banky smiles to oc.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{guess not. some doors just shouldn't be opened.}
<A>__{banky looks in another direction, oc. he looks at holden and points to it. holden looks in the same direction, and then looks back at banky and nods.}
<C>__{oc fan}
<D>__{you don't need that guy, anyway. you do great stuff without him.}
<A>__{banky looks at holden for a beat. then he brings his pointer fingers together, mimicing holden's 'shared moment' gesture. holden shrugs slightly, then crosses his fingers as if to say 'hopefully'.}
<C>__{oc fan}
<D>__{you were just carrying that guy, anyway.}
<A>__{banky sort of smiles at the oc holden. then he offers his own thumbs up as to say 'good luck'.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(to fan, still looking oc)}
<D>__{you're so right.}
<A>__{holden smiles back, nods 'bye', and walks off.}
<C>__{oc fan}
<D>__{well, keep up the good work, man. love them dick jokes. love 'em. see ya.}
<A>__{the fan leaves, but banky is watching holden go.}
<C>__{bxvky}
<D>__{yeah. bye.}
<P>__{(shakes it off)}
<D>__{okay. who's next?}
<A>__{alyssa sits at a separate signing table, with a line in front of her. a woman behind her. alyssa dashes off signatures in the copies of her comic.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(to oc departing fan)}
<D>__{thanks for reading it.}
<A>__{the woman stands and rubs her shoulders.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i'm going to get a soda. you want anything?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i'm fine, thanks,}
<A>__{the woman heads off. alyssa starts rummaging through her bag.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(not rooking up)}
<D>__{okay, who's next!}
<A>__{a comic book drops on the table in front of her. it's a comic book called 'chasing amy'. she leafs through it, not looking up.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{um... this isn't one of mine.}
<C>__{oc holden}
<D>__{it's mine.}
<A>__{alyssa looks up sharply. holden stands before her, smiling.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i saved you one.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{hi.}

<D>__{good. really good. yourself?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{good}
<P>__{(beat; off her own comic)}
<D>__{new issue's selling like crazy, for some reason.}

<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(off comic)}
<D>__{i haven't even seen this yet. did it just come out?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{a month ago. i did a really small run. self financed. only about five hundred issues.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{will i enjoy it?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you might. it's familiar subject matter.}
<A>__{alyssa leafs through it. her eyes get somewhat misty.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{looks like a very personal story.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i finally had something personal to say.}
<A>__{they look at each other for a beat}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i'm going to go. i don't want to hold up the line.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{yeah. i mean, it can get ugly. i just saw this nun in line call this small child a cunt rag.}

<D>__{nice seeing you again,}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{really nice to see you too.}
<A>__{he walks away. a few steps away, he turns and waves again. she waves back. and then he starts moving through the thrall of fan boys. the woman returns with coffee. she follows alyssa's gaze.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{who was that?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{hmm! oh. just some guy i knew.}
<A>__{she watches him go for another beat, then.}
