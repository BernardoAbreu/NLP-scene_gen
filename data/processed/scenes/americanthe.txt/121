<L>__{821. then shuts and locks the briefcase.}
<A>__{this done he sits on the bed and stares at the case. with his work complete, he is struck by a terrible sense of emptiness.}
<L>__{exterior parco della resistenza just before dawn}
<A>__{a small park not far from castel del monte's town square. it is just after dawn. the pine trees and the poplars are silent. the sun is not yet up but the day is light. sparrows hop about, searching for crumbs. jack, ravaged by lack of sleep, wonders about like the demon of a lost darkness, looking for his hole down to the underworld.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{buon giorno!}
<A>__{he's twenty meters away, his hand raised in half welcome, half benediction. they greet one another and father benedetto falls into slow step with jack. the priest walks with his hands behind his back. jack with his hands in his pockets.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{i walk here to meditate. once a week, wednesday, the farthest one can travel in the week from the sabbath. the trees are like the stations of the cross: by certain trees i thank god for certain favours he has granted me, or certain gifts he has made to me and all men. for example, here by this pine, i thank him for the many friendships i have and ask him to look after those of my friends who are troubled.}
<A>__{they reach a cypress tree and father benedetto bows his head in prayer. after a while he says:}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{some walk here in the cool of evening. others come at night.}
<A>__{there is a slight sadness in his voice as he says to himself:}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{i wonder how many bastards have been made here?}
<A>__{he gives a small sideways glance at jack.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{perhaps you'll stay and settle here yourself?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what makes you think i'm leaving?}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{you told me as much when we first met. besides, those who seek for peace seldom find it. they're always moving on, looking elsewhere. [a beat] and they are usually sinners.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{all men are sinners.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{some are greater sinners than others. and those who seek peace have much sinning in their history.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't seek peace. i never have.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{until now.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{perhaps. perhaps i will stay. the valley. the villages. the mountains.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{forgive me. this is the priest in me speaking. and the friend. but you have done much sinning, signor clarke. you still do.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i see a whore. she's young enough to be my daughter.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{i do not refer to the sins of carnality. but to the deadly sins...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{aren't all sins equal?}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{we are not discussing theology, my friend, but you. you like this town, this valley.}
<C>__{father benedetto }
<D>__{you should like to remain here and find your peace at last. yet you cannot. there is something you cannot ignore. some force. some enemy.}
<A>__{jack is silent.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{you want to speak but you dare not. you know no one sufficiently well to share your history with them. you know i am trustworthy yet still you are cautious.}
<A>__{father benedetto stops, compelling jack to stop too and face him.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{what job do you do, signor? are you on the run, as they say?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{who says?}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{it's an expression, no?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{everyone's on the run from something.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{some men watch some of the shadows. you watch them all.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i've done nothing i didn't have good cause to do.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{do you wish to tell me?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{for what reason?}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{for your own sake. perhaps i can pray for you?}
<A>__{a change of pace.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i make things. artifacts.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{counterfeit money?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{you work in metal. you are given some steel by fabio, the car doctor.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you know a lot about me.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{i know only what you do in the town. people talk to me. i am their priest and they trust me.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and i should too?}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{they stare at one another. jack wants to confess. he does not know why. but he doesn't. he does something we're not expecting:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fabio. the `car doctor'. was he conceived here father?}
<A>__{father benedetto is motionless.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{why do you ask me that?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he looks like you. even more than he does in the photos you keep of each other. where was he conceived, father? under one of these trees? at night? like all the other bastards?}
<A>__{there is a very, very long pause. father benedetto stares up at jack with extraordinary intensity.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{i do not remember, signor. it was twenty five years ago.}
<A>__{father benedetto walks. jack follows. a gust of wind makes dust swirl from the gravel path. the two men do not speak again until they reach the next set of cyprus trees.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{in the end it is i who confesses to you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{expecting me to reciprocate?}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{perhaps. for your own good. you cannot doubt the existence of hell. you live in it. it is a place without love. as for me, i go about my daily duties because the town requires it of me. some know what you know. perhaps i have no right to wear these robes. but i do have a heart full of a father's love. something close to his heart! and for that i am both grateful and happy.}
<A>__{on jack.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{what do you have, my friend?}
<A>__{another gust of wind. the priest looks up into jack's face. the assassin's eyes are red and stinging. perhaps its from the dust.}
