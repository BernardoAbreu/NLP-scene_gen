<L>__{exterior cleveland street night (1970)}
<A>__{rain. christmas lights. a rusted out '56 lincoln rattles down the bleak boulevard. in it: joe stevens, an angry, black man in his late 20's, beside him his 10 year old son, joe}
<B>__{jr.}
<A>__{joe jr. stares out the window at passing: boarded buildings, whores with raincoats over their heads trying to flag down a john, a black santa, a knot of drinkers. breaking the silence:}
<C>__{joe stevens}
<D>__{your mother okay?}
<C>__{joe jr.}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{they stop at a light. joe stevens tries to furtively snort a little something. he spots joe jr. watching.}
<C>__{joe stevens}
<P>__{(firm, without irony)}
<D>__{don't you do this shit, boy. don't you ever fuckin' touch it, you hear me?}
<A>__{joe jr. stares, silent; joe jr.'s about to hit him.}
<C>__{joe stevens}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you hear me, goddam it?}
<A>__{the boy nods. satisfied, joe sr. draws in the stuff. it makes him feel good, strong, worried and determined all at once.}
<C>__{joe stevens}
<P>__{(continuing; charged up)}
<D>__{what do you want for christmas?}
<C>__{joe jr.}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{joe stevens}
<P>__{(light changes; he accelerates)}
<D>__{you don't know?? you gotta know what you want, boy, if you ever expect to get it.}
<A>__{a sudden charm to his bravado. joe jr. smiles uncertainly. joe sr. grins back, pulls up in front of a liquor store.}
<C>__{joe stevens}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{wait here. this won't take a minute.}
<A>__{joe jr. doesn't notice or doesn't remark that his father, just before entering the store, draws a handgun from beneath his coat. the boy gazes dreamily at the street. the lunatic black santa marches by, ranting to himself ("then the white man say..."). the rain hammers on the roof and windshield. joe jr. breathes on the glass, fogging the scene. from the store: muffled gunfire. joe jr. looks that way. another gunshot, then: his father comes out the door clutching money in one hand. he strides toward the car with a reckless pride. he doesn't notice: the liquor store door opens behind him. a shotgun blast. joe stevens' guts splatter onto the car windshield. a look of terrible amazement; he sinks to his knees.}
<C>__{joe jr.}
<D>__{daddy!!}
<A>__{he jumps from the car, kneels by his father. the store owner (47, slavic) drags the gun toward them, bleeding profusely.}
<C>__{store owner}
<P>__{(enraged, almost to tears)}
<D>__{fuckin' niggers... fuckin' niggers...}
<B>__{joe stevens}
<A>__{looks at the money in his hand: two 20's, two 5's.}
<C>__{joe stevens}
<D>__{fifty bucks... fifty goddam bucks.}
<P>__{(looks up at his son)}
<D>__{i'm sorry...}
<A>__{he stuffs the blood soaked bills in the boy's shirt pocket and dies. joe jr. looks up at...}
<B>__{the store owner}
<A>__{bloody, nearly unconscious, he aims the shotgun at the boy who is too frightened to move.}
<C>__{joe jr.}
<D>__{please, mister...}
<A>__{the man dies on his feet. as he falls backward, he pulls the trigger, the blast shattering the car windows. cop cars squeal up. uniformed cops leap out, guns drawn, survey the scene. then one notices joe jr., staring motionless at his father and the store owner, dead together. on his}
