<A>__{the emory truck stops in front of the service elevator on the next level down. as the truck idles, the uniformed driver makes a note on his clipboard.}
<L>__{interior ellis' office night}
<A>__{tilt up from mcclane's bare feet. he is clenching and unclenching his toes.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(surprised, actually feeling tension decline)}
<D>__{son of a bitch. it works.}
<A>__{holly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket, tie shirt, etc. begin to wash up in the private bath.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{it's a long story. you know, i think that ellis has his eye on you.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{that's okay...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{... i have an eye on his private bathroom.}
<A>__{mcclane's face shows his relief (or rather, his attempt not to show any).}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{so, where are you staying? this all happened so fast i didn't even ask you on the phone.}
<A>__{mcclane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{well, cappy roberts retired out here a couple years ago. he said i could bunk with him.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{oh...where does he live?}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{ramona...no, pomona, that's it.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{pomona! you'll be in the car the whole time...look, let's make this easy. i have a spare bedroom. it's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.}
<A>__{mcclane fixes her with a look.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{they would, huh?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(beat; honest)}
<D>__{i would too.}
<A>__{they lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other. just then a man and a woman, both a little tipsy, open the door to the office, see that it's occupied and beat a hasty retreat. the interruption temporarily dents the mood. holly tries to smile. but for mcclane it's the last frustration.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{...i've missed you.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{especially my name. you must miss it every time you write a check. when did you start calling yourself 'ms. gennero'?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(caught)}
<D>__{this is a japanese company, you know? they figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{sure. it's unnerving. i remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...i mean, talk about your wind chill factor...}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{didn't we have this same conversation in july? damn it, john, there was an opportunity out here i had to take it }
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{no matter what it did to our marriage ?}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{my job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{oh, here it comes. one of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' i never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions }
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{you want to know my idea of a marriage? it's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i needed that, john.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i deserved that.}
<A>__{there's a clumsy pause as if she's almost challenging him to say...something but he sets his jaw, says nothing. just then the door opens and ginny leans inside.}
<C>__{ginny}
<D>__{miz gennero? mr. takagi is looking for you...he wants you to say something to the troops...}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{thanks, ginny. i will be a second. oh, this is }
<C>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(mock bright 'radio' voice)}
<D>__{hi. john gennero here. i'm the sensitive and supportive man of the eighties.}
<A>__{ginny looks puzzled, goes out. holly sighs, moves to the door.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{i will be a few minutes. wait here }
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{don't i always?}
<A>__{she's gone. immediately, he slaps his forehead, contrite.}
