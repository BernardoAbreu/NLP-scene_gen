<A>__{precious, wearing her new scarf and glasses, sits in the waiting room holding a book in her hands. abdul plays among the little children in the kids area behind her. crumpled wrapping paper lays beside her. the book's first page reads:}

<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{clareece precious jones! mrs. weiss is ready for you.}
<A>__{precious stands up and looks down at ruby, sulking in her chair. she leans down, gives her a big hug and tenderly fixes ruby's hair. precious walks off toward the stairs, but stops when she passes a mirror hanging on the wall. within the reflection, she sees her true self for the first time.}
<C>__{precious }
<D>__{one day miz rain ask us to write about our ideal self...i wrote that i would be light skinned and small wif wavy swing job hair.}
<A>__{she heads up the stairs toward the offices.}
<C>__{precious }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{miz rain read all that and then say i am beautiful like i am. i never believe her before but somehow, today, this moment can't say why, i do. just now...the inside i thought was so beautiful is a black girl too.}
<A>__{precious turns around to find that ruby has grabbed her arm. she then reaches up and hugs precious tightly. through the embrace, precious finds herself facing the many mirrors on display by the old man on the folding chair. in her reflections, she sees the skinny white girl who she has frequently imagined herself as gradually transform into the real precious one by one.}
