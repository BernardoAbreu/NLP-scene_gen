<L>__{exterior galley night}
<A>__{the ship sails like a ghost over black water, the stars lit up impossibly bright. artus finds tamara sitting near the bow. he hands her a steaming bowl of food.}
<C>__{artus}
<D>__{try not to taste it going down would be my advice.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{you've known conan long?}
<C>__{artus}
<D>__{we sailed with him for a while. i would like to say i know the man.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{he is a riddle to me.}
<C>__{artus}
<D>__{aye, he's that too.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{we have the same goal. why will he not trust me?}
<C>__{artus}
<D>__{why would he? he's a stranger in every land he trods. a man with no home, no people, none but the company of ghosts. and he bears the weight of their deaths every moment of every day.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{that is no way to live.}
<C>__{artus}
<D>__{he doesn't live. i've seen in him great mirth, only to watch it smothered by greater melancholy. he owes a blood debt, and he can entertain no other joy, no other cause, until it is fulfilled.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{and yet you call him friend, and risk death to help him.}
<C>__{artus}
<D>__{let me tell you something of conan. he will never lie. he will never break a trust, once given. and he will never, ever give up.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{he's a stubborn ass.}
<A>__{artus laughs.}
<C>__{artus}
<D>__{he is that, lass. he is that.}
